THE VANISHED MESSENGER

By E Phillips Oppenheim




CHAPTER I


There were very few people upon Platform Number Twentyone of Liverpool
Street Station at a quarter to nine on the evening of April 2possibly
because the platform in question is one of the most remote and least
used in the great terminus The stationmaster however was there
himself with an inspector in attendance A dark thickset man wearing
a long travelling ulster and a Homburg hat and carrying in his hand a
brown leather dressingcase across which was painted in black letters
the name MR JOHN P DUNSTER was standing a few yards away smoking
a long cigar and to all appearance absorbed in studying the
advertisements which decorated the grimy wall on the other side of
the single track A couple of porters were seated upon a barrow which
contained one solitary portmanteau There were no signs of other
passengers no other luggage As a matter of fact according to the
timetable no train was due to leave the station or to arrive at it on
this particular platform for several hours

Down at the other end of the platform the wooden barrier was thrust
back and a porter with some luggage upon a barrow made his noisy
approach He was followed by a tall young man in a grey tweed suit and a
straw hat on which were the colours of a famous cricket club

The inspector watched them curiously Lost his way I should think he
observed

The stationmaster nodded It looks like the young man who missed the
boat train he remarked Perhaps he has come to beg a lift

The young man in question made steady progress up the platform His
hands were thrust deep into the pockets of his coat and his forehead
was contracted in a frown As he approached more closely he singled out
Mr John P Dunster and motioning his porter to wait crossed to the
edge of the track and addressed him

Can I speak to you for a moment sir

Mr John P Dunster turned at once and faced his questioner He did so
without hastewith a certain deliberation in factyet his eyes
were suddenly bright and keen He was neatly dressed with the quiet
precision which seems as a rule to characterise the travelling American
He was apparently of a little less than middleage cleanshaven
broadshouldered with every appearance of physical strength He seemed
like a man on wires a man on the alert likely to miss nothing

Are you Mr John P Dunster the youth asked

I carry my visitingcard in my hand sir the other replied swinging
his dressingcase around My name is John P Dunster

The young mans expression was scarcely ingratiating To a natural
sullenness was added now the nervous distaste of one who approaches a
disagreeable task

I want if I may to ask you a favour he continued If you dont
feel like granting it please say no and Ill be off at once I am on my
way to The Hague I was to have gone by the boat train which left half
an hour ago I had taken a seat and they assured me that the train
would not leave for at least ten minutes as the mails werent in I
went down the platform to buy some papers and stood talking for a moment
or two with a man whom I know I suppose I must have been longer than
I thought or they must have been quicker than they expected with the
mailbags Anyhow when I came back the train was moving They would
not let me jump in I could have done it easily but that fool of an
inspector over there held me

They are very strict in this country I know

Mr Dunster agreed without change of expression Please go on

I saw you arrivejust too late for the train While I was swearing
at the inspector I heard you speak to the stationmaster Since then I
have made inquiries I understand that you have ordered a special train
to Harwich

Mr John P Dunster said nothing only his keen clear eyes seemed all
the time to be questioning this gloomylooking but apparently harmless
young man

I went to the stationmasters office the latter continued and
tried to persuade them to let me ride in the guards van of your
special but he made a stupid fuss about it so I thought Id better
come to you Can I beg a seat in your compartment or anywhere in the
train as far as Harwich

Mr Dunster avoided for the moment a direct reply He had the air of a
man who whether reasonably or unreasonably disliked the request which
had been made to him

You are particularly anxious to cross tonight he asked

I am the youth admitted emphatically I never ought to have risked
missing the train I am due at The Hague tomorrow

Mr John P Dunster moved his position a little The light from a
rainsplashed gas lamp shone now full upon the face of his suppliant a
boys face which would have been pleasant and even handsome but for the
discontented mouth the lowering forehead and a shadow in the eyes as
though boy though he certainly was in years he had already at
some time or another looked upon the serious things of life His
nervousness too was almost grotesque He had the air of disliking
immensely this asking a favour from a stranger Mr Dunster appreciated
all these things but there were reasons which made him slow in granting
the young mans request

What is the nature of your pressing business at The Hague he asked

The youth hesitated

I am afraid he said grimly that you will not think it of much
importance I am on my way to play in a golf tournament there

A golf tournament at The Hague Mr Dunster repeated in a slightly
altered tone What is your name

Gerald Fentolin

Mr Dunster stood quite still for a moment He was possessed of a
wonderful memory and he was conscious at that moment of a subtle appeal
to it Fentolin There was something in the name which seemed to him
somehow associated with the things against which he was on guard He
stood with puzzled frown reminiscent for several minutes unsuccessful
Then he suddenly smiled and moving underneath the gas lamp shook open
an evening paper which he had been carrying He turned over the pages
until he arrived at the sporting items Here in almost the first
paragraph he saw the name which had happened to catch his eye a moment
or two before

 GOLF AT THE HAGUE

 Among the entrants for the tournament which commences
 tomorrow are several wellknown English players
 including Mr Barwin Mr Parrott Mr Hillard and
 Mr Gerald Fentolin

Mr Dunster folded up the newspaper and replaced it in his pocket He
turned towards the young man

So youre a golfer are you

I play a bit was the somewhat indifferent reply

Mr Dunster turned to another part of the paper and pointed to the great
black headlines

Seems a queer thing for a young fellow like you to be worrying about
games he remarked I havent been in this country more than a few
hours but I expected to find all the young men getting ready

Getting ready for what

Why to fight of course Mr Dunster replied Seems pretty clear
that theres an expeditionary force being fitted out according to this
evenings paper somewhere up in the North Sea The only Englishman
Ive spoken to on this side was willing to lay me odds that war would be
declared within a week

The young mans lack of interest was curious

I am not in the army he said It really doesnt affect me

Mr Dunster stared at him

Youll forgive my curiosity he said but say is there nothing you
could get into and fight if this thing came along

Nothing at all that I know of the youth replied coolly War is an
affair which concerns only the military and naval part of two countries
The civil population

Plays golf I suppose Mr Dunster interrupted Young man I havent
been in England for some years and you rather take my breath away All
the same you can come along with me as far as Harwich

The young man showed signs of some satisfaction I am very much obliged
to you sir he declared I promise you I wont be in the way

The stationmaster who had been looking through a little pile of
telegrams brought to him by a clerk from his office now turned towards
them His expression was a little grave

Your special will be backing down directly sir he announced but
I am sorry to say that we hear very bad accounts of the line They say
that this is only the fagend of the storm that we are getting here and
that its been raging for nearly twentyfour hours on the east coast I
doubt whether the Harwich boat will be able to put off

We must take our chance about that Dunster remarked If the
mail boat doesnt run I presume there will be something else we can
charter

The stationmaster looked the curiosity which he did not actually
express in words

Money will buy most things nowadays sir he observed but if it
isnt fit for our mail boat it certainly isnt fit for anything else
that can come into Harwich Harbour However youll hear what they say
when you get there

Mr Dunster nodded and relapsed into a taciturnity which was obviously
one of his peculiarities The young man strolled down the platform and
catching up with the inspector touched him on the shoulder

Do you know who the fellow is he asked curiously Its awfully
decent of him to let me go with him but he didnt seem very keen about
it

The inspector shook his head

No idea sir he replied He drove up just two minutes after the
train had gone came straight into the office and ordered a special
Paid for it too in Bank of England notes before he went out I fancy
hes an American and he gave his name as John P Dunster

The young man paused to light a cigarette

If hes an American I suppose that accounts for it he observed He
must be in a precious hurry to get somewhere though

A night like this too the inspector remarked with a shiver
I wouldnt leave London myself unless I had to They say theres
a tremendous storm blowing on the east coast Here comes the train
sirjust one saloon and the guards van

The little train backed slowly along the platform side The engine was
splashed with mud and soaking wet The faces of the enginedriver and
his companion shone from the dripping rain The stationmaster held open
the door of the saloon

Youve a rough journey before you sir he said Youll catch the
boat all right thoughif it goes The mail train was very heavy
tonight You should catch her up this side of Colchester

Mr Dunster nodded

I am taking this young gentleman with me he announced shortly
It seems that he too missed the train I am much obliged to you
stationmaster for your attention Good night

They were about to start when Mr Dunster once more let down the window

By the way he said as it is such a wild night you will oblige me
very much if you will tell the enginedriver that there will be a
five pound note for himself and his companion if we catch the mail
Inspector

The inspector touched his hat The stationmaster had turned discreetly
away He had been an inspector himself once and sovereigns had been
useful to him too Then the train glided from the platform side
plunged with a scream through a succession of black tunnels and with
rapidly increasing speed faced the storm




CHAPTER II

The young man sat on one side of the saloon and Mr John P Dunster on
the other Although both of them were provided with a certain amount of
railway literature neither of them made any pretence at reading The
older man with his feet upon the opposite seat and his arms folded
was looking pensively through the rainsplashed windowpane into the
impenetrable darkness The young man although he could not ignore his
companions unsociable instincts was fidgety

There will be some floods out tomorrow he remarked

Mr Dunster turned his head and looked across the saloon There was
something in the deliberate manner of his doing so and his hesitation
before he spoke which seemed intended to further impress upon the young
man the fact that he was not disposed for conversation

Very likely was his sole reply

Gerald Fentolin sighed as though he regretted his companions
taciturnity and a few minutes later strolled to the farther end of the
saloon He spent some time trying to peer through the streaming window
into the darkness He chatted for a few minutes with the guard who was
however in a bad temper at having had to turn out and who found little
to say Then he took one of his golf clubs from the bag and indulged in
several half swings Finally he stretched himself out upon one of the
seats and closed his eyes

May as well try to get a nap he yawned There wont be much chance
on the steamer if it blows like this

Mr Dunster said nothing His face was set his eyes were looking
somewhere beyond the confines of the saloon in which he was seated So
they travelled for over an hour The young man seemed to be dozing in
earnest when with a succession of jerks the train rapidly slackened
speed Mr Dunster let down the window The interior of the carriage was
at once thrown into confusion A couple of newspapers were caught up and
whirled around a torrent of rain beat in Mr Dunster rapidly closed
the window and rang the bell The guard came in after a moment or two
His clothes were shiny from the wet raindrops hung from his beard

What is the matter Mr Dunster demanded Why are we waiting here

Theres a block on the line somewhere the man replied Cant
tell where exactly The signals are against us thats all we know at
present

They crawled on again in about ten minutes stopped and resumed their
progress at an even slower rate Mr Dunster once more summoned the
guard

Why are we travelling like this he asked impatiently We shall never
catch the boat

We shall catch the boat all right if it runs sir the man assured
him The mail is only a mile or two ahead of us thats one reason why
we have to go so slowly Then the water is right over the line where
we are now and we cant get any news at all from the other side of
Ipswich If it goes on like this some of the bridges will be down
thats what Im afraid of

Mr Dunster frowned For the first time he showed some signs of
uneasiness

Perhaps he muttered half to himself a motorcar would have been
better

Not on your life his young companion intervened All the roads to
the coast here cross no end of small bridgesmuch weaker affairs
than the railway bridges I bet there are some of those down already
Besides you wouldnt be able to see where you were going on a night
like this

There appears to be a chance Mr Dunster remarked drily that you
will have to scratch for your competition tomorrow

Also the young man observed that you will have taken this special
train for nothing I cant fancy the Harwich boat going out a night like
this

Mr Dunster relapsed into stony but anxious silence The train continued
its erratic progress sometimes stopping altogether for a time with
whistle blowing repeatedly sometimes creeping along the metals as
though feeling its way to safety At last after a somewhat prolonged
wait the guard whose hoarse voice they had heard on the platform of
the small station in which they were standing entered the carriage
With him came a gust of wind once more sending the papers flying around
the compartment The rain dripped from his clothes on to the carpet
He had lost his hat his hair was tossed with the wind his face was
bleeding from a slight wound on the temple

The boat trains just ahead of us sir he announced She cant get
on any better than we can Weve just heard that theres a bridge down
on the line between Ipswich and Harwich

What are we going to do then Mr Dunster demanded

Thats just what Ive come to ask you sir the guard replied The
mails going slowly on as far as Ipswich I fancy theyll lie by
there until the morning The best thing that I can see is if youre
agreeable to take you back to London We can very likely do that all
right if we start at once

Mr Dunster ignoring the mans suggestion drew from one of the
voluminous pockets of his ulster a small map He spread it open upon the
table before him and studied it attentively

If I cannot get to Harwich he asked is there any possibility of
keeping straight on and reaching Yarmouth

The guard hesitated

We havent heard anything about the line from Ipswich to Norwich sir
he replied but we cant very well change our course without definite
instructions

Your definite instructions Mr Dunster reminded him drily were to
take me to Harwich You have been forced to depart from them I see no
harm in your adopting any suggestions I may have to make concerning our
altered destination I will pay the extra mileage naturally

How far did you wish to go sir the guard enquired

To Yarmouth Mr Dunster replied firmly If there are bridges down
and communication with Harwich is blocked Yarmouth would suit me better
than anywhere

The guard shook his head

I couldnt go on that way sir without instructions

Is there a telegraph office at this station Mr Dunster inquired

We can speak anywhere on the line the guard replied

Then wire to the stationmaster at Liverpool Street Mr Dunster
instructed You can get a reply from him in the course of a few
minutes Explain the situation and tell him what my wishes are

The guard hesitated

Its a goodish way from here to Norwich he observed and for all we
know

When we left Liverpool Street Station Mr Dunster interrupted I
promised five pounds each to you the enginedriver and his mate That
five pounds shall be made twentyfive if you succeed in getting me to
the coast Do your best for me

The guard raised his hat and departed without another word

It will probably suit you better Mr Dunster continued turning to
his companion to leave me at Ipswich and join the mail

The latter shook his head

I dont see that theres any chance anyway of my getting over in time
now he remarked If youll take me on with you as far as Norwich I
can go quietly home from there

You live in this part of the world then Mr Dunster asked

The young man assented Again there was a certain amount of hesitation
in his manner

I live some distance the other side of Norwich he said I dont want
to sponge on you too much he went on but if youre really going to
stick it out and try and get there Id like to go on too I am afraid
I cant offer to share the expense but Id work my passage if there was
anything to be done

Mr Dunster drummed for a moment upon the table with his fingers All
the time the young man had been speaking his eyes had been studying his
face He turned now once more to his map

It was my idea he said to hire a steam trawler from Yarmouth If I
do so you can if you wish accompany me so far as the port at which we
may land in Holland On the other hand to be perfectly frank with you
I should prefer to go alone There will be no doubt a certain amount
of risk in crossing tonight My own business is of importance A golf
tournament however is scarcely worth risking your life for is it

Oh I dont know about that the young man replied grimly I fancy
I should rather like it Lets see whether we can get on to Norwich
anyhow shall we We may find that there are bridges down on that line

They relapsed once more into silence Presently the guard reappeared

Instructions to take you on to Yarmouth if possible sir he
announced and to collect the mileage at our destination

That will be quite satisfactory Mr Dunster agreed Let us be off
then as soon as possible Presently they crawled on They passed the
boat train in Ipswich Station where they stayed for a few moments
Mr Dunster bought wine and sandwiches and his companion followed his
example Then they continued their journey An hour or more passed the
storm showed no signs of abatement Their speed now rarely exceeded ten
or fifteen miles an hour Mr Dunster smoked all the time occasionally
rubbing the windowpane and trying to look out Gerald Fentolin slept
fitfully

Have you any idea where we are Mr Dunster asked once

The boy cautiously let down the window a little way With the noise of
the storm came another sound to which he listened for a moment with
puzzled face a dull rumbling sound like the falling of water He
closed the window breathless

I dont think we are far from Norwich We passed Forncett anyhow some
time ago

Still raining

In torrents I cant see a yard ahead of me I bet we get some floods
after this I expect they are out now if one could only see

They crept on Suddenly above the storm they heard what sounded at
first like the booming of a gun and then a shrill whistle from some
distance ahead They felt the jerk as their brakes were hastily applied
the swaying of the little train and then the crunching of earth beneath
them the roar of escaping steam as their engine ploughed its way on
into the road bed

Off the rails the boy cried springing to his feet Hold on tightly
sir Id keep away from the window

The carriage swayed and rocked Suddenly a telegraph post seemed to come
crashing through the window and the polished mahogany panels The young
man escaped it by leaping to one side It caught Mr Dunster who had
just risen to his feet upon the forehead There was a crash all around
of splitting glass a further shock They were both thrown off their
feet The light was suddenly extinguished With the crashing of glass
the splitting of timbera hideous tearing soundthe wrecked saloon
dragging the engine halfway over with it slipped down a low embankment
and lay on its side what remained of it in a field of turnips




CHAPTER III

As the young man staggered to his feet he had somehow a sense of
detachment as though he were commencing a new life or had suddenly
come into a new existence Yet his immediate surroundings were charged
with ugly reminiscences Through a great gap in the ruined side of the
saloon the rain was tearing in As he stood up his head caught the
fragments of the roof He was able to push back the wreckage with ease
and step out For a moment he reeled as he met the violence of the
storm Then clutching hold of the side of the wreck he steadied
himself A light was moving back and forth close at hand He cried out
weakly Hullo

A man carrying a lantern bent double as he made his way against the
wind crawled up to them He was a porter from the station close at
hand

My God he exclaimed Any one alive here

Im all right Gerald muttered at least I suppose I am Whats it
allwhats it all about Weve had an accident

The porter caught hold of a piece of the wreckage with which to steady
himself

Your train ran right into three feet of water he answered The rails
had gonetorn up The telegraph lines down

Why didnt you stop the train

We were doing all we could the man retorted gloomily We werent
expecting anything else through tonight Wed a man along the line with
a lantern but hes just been found blown over the embankment with his
head in a pool of water Any one else in your carriage

One gentleman travelling with me Gerald answered Wed better try to
get him out What about the guard and enginedriver

The enginedriver and stoker are both alive the porter told him
I came across them before I saw you Theyre both knocked sort of
sillylike but they arent much hurt The guards stone dead

Where are we

A few hundred yards from Wymondham Lets have a look for the other
gentleman

Mr John P Dunster was lying quite still his right leg doubled up and
a huge block of telegraph post which the saloon had carried with it
in its fall still pressing against his forehead He groaned as they
dragged him out and laid him down upon a cushion in the shelter of the
wreckage

Hes alive all right the porter remarked Theres a doctor on the
way Lets cover him up quick and wait

Cant we carry him to shelter of some sort Gerald proposed

The man shook his head Speech of any sort was difficult Even with his
lips close to the others ears he had almost to shout

Couldnt be done he replied Its all one can do to walk alone when
you get out in the middle of the field away from the shelter of the
embankment here Theres bits of trees flying all down the lane Never
was such a night Folks is fair afraid of the morning to see whats
happened Theres a mill blown right over on its side in the next field
and the man in charge of it lying dead This poor chaps bad enough

Gerald on all fours had crept back into the compartment The bottle
of wine was smashed into atoms He came out dragging the small
dressingcase which his companion had kept on the table before him One
side of it was dented in but the lock which was of great strength
still held

Perhaps theres a flask somewhere in this dressingcase Gerald said
Lend me a knife

Strong though it had been the lock was already almost torn out from its
foundation They forced the spring and opened it The porter turned his
lantern on the widening space Just as Gerald was raising the lid very
slowly to save the contents from being scattered by the wind the man
turned his head to answer an approaching hail Gerald raised the lid a
little higher and suddenly closed it with a bang

Theres folks coming at last the porter exclaimed turning around
excitedly Theyve been a time and no mistake The village isnt a
quarter of a mile away Did you find a flask sir

Gerald made no answer The dressingcase once more was closed and his
hand pressed upon the lid The porter turned the light upon his face and
whistled softly

Youre about done yourself sir he remarked Hold up

He caught the young man in his arms There was another roar in Geralds
ears besides the roar of the wind He had never fainted in his life but
the feeling was upon him nowa deadly sickness a swaying of the earth
The porter suddenly gave a little cry

If Im not a born idiot he exclaimed drawing a bottle from the
pocket of his coat with his disengaged hand Theres whisky here I was
taking it home to the missis for her rheumatism Now then

He drew the cork from the bottle with his teeth and forced some of the
liquid between the lips of the young man The voices now were coming
nearer and nearer Gerald made a desperate effort

I am all right he declared Lets look after him

They groped their way towards the unconscious man Gerald still gripping
the dressingcase with both hands There were no signs of any change
in his condition but he was still breathing heavily Then they heard a
shout behind almost in their ears The porter staggered to his feet

Its all right now sir he exclaimed Theyve brought blankets and a
stretcher and brandy Heres a doctor sir

A powerfullooking man hatless and wrapped in a great ulster moved
towards them

How many are there of you he asked as he bent over Mr Dunster

Only we two Gerald replied Is my friend badly hurt

Concussion the doctor announced Well take him to the village What
about you young man Your face is bleeding I see

Just a cut Gerald faltered nothing else

Lucky chap the doctor remarked Lets get him to shelter of some
sort Come along Theres an inn at the corner of the lane there

They all staggered along Gerald still clutching the dressingcase
and supported on the other side by an excited and somewhat incoherent
villager

Such a storm as never was the latter volunteered The telegraph
wires are all down for miles and miles There wont be no trains running
along this line come many a week and as for treeswhy its as though
some one had been playing ninepins in Squire Fellowess park When the
morning do come for sure there will be things to be seen This way
sir Be careful of the gate

They staggered along down the lane climbing once over a tree which lay
across the lane and far into the adjoining field Soon they were joined
by more of the villagers roused from their beds by rumours of terrible
happenings The little singlestorey ivycovered inn was all lit up
and the door held firmly open They passed through the narrow entrance
and into the stoneflagged barroom where the men laid down their
stretcher As many of the villagers as could crowd in filled the
passage Gerald sank into a chair The sudden absence of wind was almost
disconcerting He felt himself once more in danger of fainting He was
only vaguely conscious of drinking hot milk poured from a jug by a
redfaced and sympathetic woman Its restorative effect however was
immediate and wonderful The mist cleared from before his eyes his
brain began to work Always in the background the horror and the
shame were there the shame which kept his hand pressed with unnatural
strength upon the broken lock of that dressingcase He sat a little
apart from the others and listened Above the confused murmur of voices
he could hear the doctors comment and brief orders as he rose to his
feet after examining the unconscious man

An ordinary concussion he declared I must get round and see the
enginedriver now They have got him in a shed by the embankment Ill
call in again later on Lets have one more look at you young man

He glanced at the cut on Geralds forehead noted the access of colour
in his cheeks and nodded

Born to be hanged you were he pronounced Youve had a marvellous
escape Ill be in again presently No need to worry about your friend
He looks as though hed got a mighty constitution Light my lantern
Brown Two of you had better come with me to the shed Its no night for
a man to be wandering about alone

He departed and many of the villagers with him The landlady sat down
and began to weep

Such a night Such a night she exclaimed wringing her hands And
theres the doctor talks about putting the poor gentleman to bed Why
the roofs off the back part of the house and not a bedroom in the
place but mine and Johns and the rain coming in there in torrents
Such a night Its the judgment of the Lord upon us Thats what it
isthe judgment of the Lord

Judgment of the fiddlesticks her husband growled Cant you light
the fire woman Whats the good of sitting there whining

Light the fire she repeated bitterly and the chimney lying out in
the road Do you want to suffocate us all or is the beer still in your
head Its your evil doings Richard Budden and others like you that
have brought this upon us If Mr Wembley would but come in and pray

Her husband scoffed He was dressed only in his shirt and trousers his
hair rough his braces hanging down behind

Come in and pray he repeated Not he Not Mr Wembley Hes safe
tucked up in his bed shivering with fear Ill bet you Hes not
getting his feet wet to save a body or lend a hand here Souls are his
job You let the preacher alone mother and tell us what were going to
do with this gentleman

The Lord only knows she cried wringing her hands

Can I hire a motorcar from anywhere near Gerald asked

Theres motorcars right enough the innkeeper replied but not many
as would be fools enough to take one out You couldnt see the road and
I doubt if one of them plaguey things would stir in this storm

Such nonsense as you talk Richard Budden his wife exclaimed sharply
Its twenty minutes past three of the clock and theres light coming
on us fast If so be as the young gentleman knows folks round about
here or happens to live nigh why shouldnt he take one of them
motorcars and get away to some decent place Itll be better for the
poor gentleman than lying here in a house smitten by the Lord

Gerald rose stiffly to his feet An idea was forming in his brain His
eyes were bright He looked at the body of John Dunster upon the floor
and felt once more in his pocket

How far off is the garage he asked

Its right across the way the innkeeper replied a speculation of
Neighbour Martins and a foolish one it do seem to me Hes two cars
there and one he lets to the Government for delivering the mails

Gerald felt in his pocket and produced a sovereign

Give this he said to any man you can find who will go across
there and bring me a carthe most powerful theyve got if theres any
difference Tell them Ill pay well Thismy friend will be much better
at home with me than in a strange place when he comes to his senses

Its sound common sense the woman declared Be off with you
Richard

The man was looking at the coin covetously but his wife pushed him
away

Its not a sovereign youll be taking from the gentleman for a little
errand like that she insisted sharply He shall pay us for what hes
had when he goes and welcome and if so be that hes willing to make it
a sovereign to include the milk and the brandy and the confusion weve
been put to this night well and good Its a heavy reckoning maybe
but the night calls for it Well see about that afterwards Get along
with you I say Richard

Ill be wet through the man muttered

And serve you right the woman exclaimed If theres a man in this
village tonight whose clothes are dry its a thing for him to be
ashamed of

The innkeeper reluctantly departed They heard the roar of the wind as
the door was opened and closed The woman poured out another glass of
milk and brought it to Gerald

A godless man mine she said grimly If so happen as Mr Wembley had
come to these parts years ago Id have seen myself in my grave before
Id have married a publican But its too late now Were mostly too
late about the things that count in this world So its your friend
thats been stricken down young man A wellliving man I hope

Gerald shivered ever so slightly He drank the milk however He felt
that he might need his strength

What train might you have been on the woman continued Theres none
due on this line that we knew of David Bass the stationmaster was
here but two hours ago and said hed finished for the night and praised
the Lord for that The goods trains had all been stopped at Ipswich and
the first passenger train was not due till six oclock

Gerald shook his head with an affectation of weariness

I dont know he replied I dont remember anything about it We were
hours late I think

The woman was looking down at the unconscious man Gerald rose slowly to
his feet and stood by her side The face of Mr John P Dunster even in
unconsciousness had something in it of strength and purpose The shape
of his head the squareness of his jaws the straightness of his thick
lips all seemed to speak of a hard and inflexible disposition His hair
was coal black coarse and without the slightest sprinkling of grey He
had the neck and throat of a fighter But for that single livid blue
mark across his forehead he carried with him no signs of his accident
He was a little inclined to be stout There was a heavy gold chain
stretched across his waistcoat From where he lay the shining handle
of his revolver protruded from his hip pocket

Sakes alive the woman muttered as she looked down What does he
carry a thing like that forin a peaceful country too

It was just an idea of his Gerald answered We were going abroad in
a day or two He was always nervous If you like Ill take it away

He stooped down and withdrew it from the unconscious mans pocket He
started as he discovered that it was loaded in every chamber

I cant bear the sight of them things the woman declared Its the
men of evil ways whove no trust in the Lord who need that sort of
protection

They heard the door pushed open the howl of wind down the passage
and the beating of rain upon the stone flags Then it was softly closed
again The landlord staggered into the room followed by a young man

This ere is Mr Martins chaffer he announced You can tell him
what you want yerself

Gerald turned almost eagerly towards the newcomer

I want to go to the other side of Holt he said and get my
friendget this gentleman away from hereget him home if possible
Can you take me

The chauffeur looked doubtful

Im afraid of the roads sir he replied Theres talk about many
bridges down and trees and theres floods out everywhere Theres
half a foot of water even across the village street now Im afraid we
shouldnt get very far

Look here Gerald begged eagerly lets make a shot at it Ill pay
you double the hire of the car and Ill be responsible for any damage
I want to get out of this beastly place Lets get somewhere at any
rate towards a civilised country Ill see you dont lose anything
Ill give you a five pound note for yourself if we get as far as Holt

Im on the young man agreed shortly Its an open car you know

It doesnt matter Gerald replied I can stick it in front with you
and we can coverhim up in the tonneau

Youll wait until the doctor comes back the landlord asked

And why should they his wife interposed sharply Them doctors are
all the same Hell try and keep the poor gentleman here for the sake
of a few extra guineas and a miserable place for him to open his
eyes upon even if the rest of the roof holds which for my part Im
beginning to doubt Theyd have to move him from here with the daylight
anyhow He cant lie in the bar parlour all day can he

It dont seem right somehow the man complained doggedly The
doctor didnt say anything about having him moved

You get the car Gerald ordered the young man Ill take the whole
responsibility

The chauffeur silently left the room Gerald put a couple of sovereigns
upon the mantelpiece

My friend is a man of somewhat peculiar temperament he said quietly
If he finds himself at home in a comfortable room when he comes to his
senses I am quite sure that he will have a better chance of recovery
He cannot possibly be made comfortable here and he will feel the shock
of what has happened all the more if he finds himself still in the
neighbourhood when he opens his eyes If there is any change in his
condition we can easily stop somewhere on the way

The woman pocketed the two sovereigns

Thats common sense sir she agreed heartily and Im sure we are
very much obliged to you If we had a decent room and a roof above it
youd be heartily welcome but as it is this is no place for a sick
man and those that say different dont know what they are talking
about Thats a real careful young man whos going to take you along in
the motorcar Hell get you there safe if any one will

What I say is her husband protested sullenly that we ought to wait
for the doctors orders Im against seeing a poor body like that jolted
across the country in an open motorcar in his state Im not sure that
its for his good

And what business is it of yours I should like to know the woman
demanded sharply You get upstairs and begin moving the furniture from
where the rains coming sopping in And if so be you can remember while
you do it that this is a judgment thats come upon us why so much the
better We are evildoers all of us though them as likes the easy ways
generally manage to forget it

The man retreated silently The woman sat down upon a stool and waited
Gerald sat opposite to her the battered dressingcase upon his knees
Between them was stretched the body of the unconscious man

Are you used to prayer young sir the woman asked

Gerald shook his head and the woman did not pursue the subject Only
once her eyes were half closed and her words drifted across the room

The Lord have mercy on this man a sinner




CHAPTER IV

My advice to you sir is to chuck it

Gerald turned towards the chauffeur by whose side he was seated a little
stiffly for his limbs were numbed with the cold and exhaustion The
morning had broken with a grey and uncertain light A vaporous veil of
mist seemed to have taken the place of the darkness Even from the top
of the hill where the car had come to a standstill there was little to
be seen

We must have come forty miles already the chauffeur continued what
with going out of our way all the time because of the broken bridges
Im pretty well frozen through and as for him he added jerking his
thumb across his shoulder it seems to me youre taking a bit of a
risk

The doctor said he would remain in exactly the same condition for
twentyfour hours Gerald declared

Yes but he didnt say anything about shaking him up over forty
miles of rough road the other protested Youll excuse me sir he
continued in a slightly changed tone it isnt my business of course
but Im fairly done It dont seem reasonable to stick at it like this
Theres Holt village not a mile away and a comfortable inn and a fire
waiting I thought that was as far as you wanted to come We might lie
up there for a few hours at any rate

His passenger slipped down from his place and lifting the rug peered
into the tonneau of the car over which they had tied a hood To all
appearance the condition of the man who lay there was unchanged There
was a slightly added blueness about the lips but his breathing was still
perceptible It seemed even a little stronger Gerald resumed his seat

It isnt worth while to stay at Holt he said quietly We are
scarcely seven miles from home now Sit still for a few minutes and get
your wind

Only seven miles the chauffeur repeated more cheerfully Thats
something anyway

And all downhill

Towards the sea then

Straight to the sea Gerald told him The place we are making for is
St Davids Hall near Salthouse

The chauffeur seemed a little startled

Why thats Squire Fentolins house

Gerald nodded

That is where we are going You follow this road almost straight
ahead

The chauffeur slipped in the clutch

Oh I know the way now sir right enough he exclaimed Theres
Salthouse marsh to cross though I dont know about that

We shall manage that all right Gerald declared Weve more light
now too

They both looked around During the last few minutes the late morning
seemed to have forced its way through the clouds They had a dim
phantasmagoric view of the stricken country a watery plain with here
and there great patches of fields submerged to the hedges and houses
standing out amidst the waste of waters like toy dwellings There were
whole plantations of uprooted trees Close to the road on their left
was a roofless house and a family of children crying underneath a
tarpaulin shelter As they crept on the wind came to them with a
brackish flavour salt with the sea The chauffeur was gazing ahead
doubtfully

I dont like the look of the marsh he grumbled Cant see the road
at all However here goes

Another halfhour Gerald assured him encouragingly and we shall be
at St Davids Hall You can have as much rest as you like then

They were facing the wind now and conversation became impossible
Twice they had to pull up sharp and make a considerable detour once
on account of a fallen tree which blocked the road and another time
because of the yawning gap where a bridge had fallen away Gerald
however knew every inch of the country they were in and was able to
give the necessary directions They began to meet farm wagons now full
of people who had been driven from their homes Warnings and information
as to the state of the roads were shouted to them continually Presently
they came to the last steep descent and emerged from the devastated
fragment of a wood almost on to the sea level The chauffeur clapped on
his brakes and stopped short

My God he exclaimed Heres more trouble

Gerald for a moment was speechless They seemed to have come suddenly
upon a huge plain of waters an immense lake reaching as far as they
could see on either side The road before them stretched like a ribbon
for the next three miles Here and there it disappeared and reappeared
again In many places it was lapped by little waves Everywhere the
hedges were either altogether or half under water In the distance was
one farmhouse only the roof of which was visible and from which the
inhabitants were clambering into a boat And beyond with scarcely a
break save for the rising of one strangelyshaped hill was the sea
Gerald pointed with his finger

Theres St Davids Hall he said on the other side of the hill The
road seems all right

Does it the chauffeur grunted Its under water more than half the
way and Heaven knows how deep it is at the sides Im not going to risk
my life along there I am going to take the car back to Holt

His hand was already upon the reverse lever but Gerald gripped it

Look here he protested we havent come all this way to turn back
You dont look like a coward

I am not a coward sir was the quiet answer Neither am I a fool
I dont see any use in risking our lives and my masters motorcar
because you want to get home

Naturally Gerald answered calmly but remember this I am
responsible for your carnot you Mr Fentolin is my uncle

The chauffeur nodded shortly

Youre Mr Gerald Fentolin arent you sir he remarked I thought I
recognised you

I am Gerald admitted Weve had a rough journey but it doesnt seem
sense to turn back now does it with the house in sight

Thats all very well sir the chauffeur objected doubtfully but I
dont believe the roads even passable and the floods seem to me to be
rising

Try it the young man begged Look here I dont want to bribe you
or anything of that sort You know youre coming out of this well Its
a serious matter for me and I shant be likely to forget it I want to
take this gentleman to St Davids Hall and not to a hospital Youve
brought me here so far like a man Lets go through with it If the
worst comes to the worst we can both swim I suppose and we are not
likely to get out of our depth

The chauffeur moved his head backwards

How about him

He must take his chance Gerald replied Hes all right where he is
The car wont upset and there are plenty of people wholl see if we get
into trouble Come lets make a dash for it

The chauffeur thrust in his clutch and settled himself down They glided
off along that winding stretch of road To its very edge on either side
of them so close that they could almost touch it came the water
water which stretched as far as they could see swaying waveless
sinisterlooking Even Gerald after his first impulse of wonder kept
his eyes averted and fixed upon the road ahead Soon they reached a
place where the water met in front There were only the rows of white
palings on either side to guide them The chauffeur muttered to himself
as he changed to his first speed

If the engine gets stopped he said I dont know how we shall get
out of this

They emerged on the other side For some time they had a clear run Then
suddenly the driver clapped on his brakes

My God he cried We cant get through that

In front of them for more than a hundred yards the water seemed suddenly
to have flowed across the road Still a mile distant perched on a ridge
of that strangelyplaced hill was their destination

It cant be done sir the man groaned There isnt a car ever built
could get through that See its nearly up to the top of those posts I
must put her in the reverse and get back even if we have to wait on the
higher part of the road for a boat

He glanced behind and a second cry broke from his lips Gerald stood up
in his place Already the road which had been clear a few minutes before
was hidden The water was washing almost over the tops of the white
posts behind them Little waves were breaking against the summit of the
raised bank

Were cut off the chauffeur exclaimed What a fool I was to try
this Theres the tide coming in as well

Gerald sat down in his place

Look here he said we cant go back whether we want to or not Its
much worse behind there than it is in front Theres only one chance Go
for it straight ahead in your first speed It may not stop the engine
In any case it will be worse presently Theres no use funking it If
the worst happens we can sit in the car The water wont be above our
heads and there are some boats about Blow your horn well first in case
theres any one within hearing and then go for it

The chauffeur obeyed They hissed and spluttered into the water Soon
all trace of the road was completely lost They steered only by the tops
of the white posts

Its getting deeper the man declared Its within an inch or two of
the bonnet now Hold on

A wave broke almost over them but the engine continued its beat

If we stop now he gasped were done

The engine began to knock

Stick at it Gerald cried rising in his place a little Look
theres only one post lower than the last one that we passed They get
higher all the time ahead You can almost see the road in front there
Now in with your gear again and stick at it

Another wave broke this time completely over them They listened with
strained earsthe engine continued to beat They still moved slowly
Then there was a shock The wheel had struck something in the roada
great stone or rock The chauffeur thrust the car out of gear The
engine still beat Gerald leaped from the car The water was over his
knees He crossed in front of the bonnet and stooped down

Ive got it he exclaimed tugging hard Its a stone

He moved it rolled it on one side and pushed at the wheel of the car
as his companion put in the speed They started again He jumped back
his place

Weve done it all right he cried Dont you see Its getting lower
all the time

The chauffeur had lost his nerve His cheeks were pale his teeth
were chattering The engine however was still beating Gradually the
pressure of the water grew less In front of them they caught a glimpse
of the road They drew up at the top of a little bridge over one of the
dikes Gerald uttered a brief exclamation of triumph

Were safe he almost sobbed Theres the road straight ahead and
round to the right Theres no more water anywhere near

They had left the main part of the flood behind them There were still
great pools in the side of the road and huge masses of seaweed had
been carried up and were lying in their track There was no more water
however At every moment they drew nearer to the strangelyshaped hill
with its crown of trees

The house is on the other side Gerald pointed out We can go through
the lodge gates at the back here The ascent isnt so steep

They turned sharply to the right along another stretch of straight road
set with white posts ending before a red brick lodge and a closed
gate They blew the horn and a gardener came out He gazed at them in
amazement

Its all right Gerald cried Let us through quickly Foulds Weve a
gentleman in behind whos ill

The man swung open the gate with a respectful salute They made their
way up a winding drive of considerable length and at last they came
to a broad open space almost like a platform On their left were the
marshes and beyond the sea Along their right stretched the long front
of an Elizabethan mansion They drew up in front of the hall door Their
coming had been observed and servants were already waiting Gerald
sprang to the ground

Theres a gentleman in behind whos ill he explained to the butler
He has met with an accident on the way Three or four of you had better
carry him up to a bedroomany one that is ready And you George he
added turning to a boy get into the car and show this man the way
round to the garage and then take him to the servants hall

Several of the servants hastened to do his bidding and Gerald did his
best to answer the eager but respectful stream of questions And then
just as they were in the act of lifting the still unconscious man on
to the floor of the hall came a queer sounda shrill reverberating
whistle They all looked up the stairs

The master is awake Henderson the butler remarked dropping his
voice a little

Gerald nodded

I will go to him at once he said




CHAPTER V

Accustomed though he was to the sight which he was about to face
Gerald shivered slightly as he opened the door of Mr Fentolins room
A strange sort of fear seemed to have crept into his bearing and
expression a fear of which there had been no traces whatever during
those terrible hours through which he had passednot even during that
last reckless journey across the marshes He walked with hesitating
footsteps across the spacious and lofty room He had the air of some
frightened creature approaching his master Yet all that was visible of
the despot who ruled his whole household in deadly fear was the kindly
and beautiful face of an elderly man whose stunted limbs and body were
mercifully concealed He sat in a little carriage with a rug drawn
closely across his chest and up to his armpits His beautifully shaped
hands were exposed and his face nothing else His hair was a silvery
white his complexion parchmentlike pallid entirely colourless His
eyes were a soft shade of blue His features were so finely cut and
chiselled that they resembled some exquisite piece of statuary He
smiled as his nephew came slowly towards him One might almost have
fancied that the young mans abject state was a source of pleasure to
him

So you are back again my dear Gerald A pleasant surprise indeed but
what is the meaning of it And what of my little commission eh

The young mans face was dark and sullen He spoke quickly but without
any sign of eagerness or interest in the information he vouchsafed

The storm has stopped all the trains he said The boat did not cross
last night and in any case I couldnt have reached Harwich As for your
commission I travelled down from London alone with the man you told me
to spy upon I could have stolen anything he had if I had been used to
the work As it wasI brought the man himself

Mr Fentolins delicate fingers played with the handle of his chair
The smile had passed from his lips He looked at his nephew in gentle
bewilderment

My dear boy he protested come come be careful what you are
saying You have brought the man himself So far as my information
goes Mr John P Dunster is charged with a very important diplomatic
commission He is on his way to Cologne and from what I know about the
man I think that it would require more than your persuasions to induce
him to break off his journey You do not really wish me to believe that
you have brought him here as a guest

I was at Liverpool Street Station last night Gerald declared I had
no idea how to accost him and as to stealing any of his belongings I
couldnt have done it You must hear how fortune helped me though Mr
Dunster missed the train so did Ipurposely He ordered a special
I asked permission to travel with him I told him a lie as to how I had
missed the train I hated it but it was necessary

Mr Fentolin nodded approvingly

My dear boy he said to trifle with the truth is always unpleasant
Besides you are a Fentolin and our love of truth is proverbial But
there are times you know when for the good of others we must sacrifice
our scruples So you told Mr Dunster a falsehood

He let me travel with him Gerald continued We were all night
getting about halfway here Thenyou know about the storm I suppose

Mr Fentolin spread out his hands

Could one avoid the knowledge of it he asked Such a sight has never
been seen

We found we couldnt get to Harwich Gerald went on They telegraphed
to London and got permission to bring us to Yarmouth We were on our way
to Norwich and the train ran off the line

An accident Mr Fentolin exclaimed

Gerald nodded

Our train ran off the line and pitched down an embankment Mr Dunster
has concussion of the brain He and I were taken to a miserable little
inn near Wymondham From there I hired a motorcar and brought him
here

You hired a motorcar and brought him here Mr Fentolin repeated
softly My dear boyforgive me if I find this a little hard to
understand You say that you have brought him here Had he nothing to
say about it

He was unconscious when we picked him up Gerald explained He
is unconscious now The doctor said he would remain so for at least
twentyfour hours and it didnt seem to me that the journey would do
him any particular harm The roof had been stripped off the inn where
we were and the place was quite uninhabitable so we should have had
to have moved him somewhere We put him in the tonneau of the car and
covered him up They have carried him now into a bedroom and Sarson is
looking after him

Mr Fentolin sat quite silent His eyes blinked once or twice and there
was a curious curve about his lips

You have done well my boy he pronounced slowly Your scheme of
bringing him here sounds a little primitive but success justifies
everything

Mr Fentolin raised to his lips and blew softly a little gold whistle
which hung from a chain attached to his waistcoat Almost immediately
the door opened A man entered dressed somberly in black whose bearing
and demeanour alike denoted the servant but whose physique was the
physique of a prizefighter He was scarcely more than five feet six in
height but his shoulders were extraordinarily broad He had a short
bull neck and long mighty arms His face with the heavy jaw and small
eyes was the face of the typical fighting man yet his features seemed
to have become disposed by habit into an expression of gentle almost
servile civility

Meekins Mr Fentolin said a visitor has arrived Do you happen to
have noticed what luggage he brought

There is one small dressingcase sir the man replied nothing else
that I have seen

That is all we brought Gerald interposed

You will bring the dressingcase here at once Mr Fentolin directed
and also my compliments to Doctor Sarson and any pocketbook or papers
which may help us to send a message to the gentlemans friends

Meekins closed the door and departed Mr Fentolin turned back towards
his nephew

My dear boy he said tell me why you look as though there were
ghosts flitting about the room You are not ill I trust

Tired perhaps Gerald answered shortly We were many hours in the
car I have had no sleep

Mr Fentolins face was full of kindly sympathy

My dear fellow he exclaimed I am selfish indeed I should not have
kept you here for a moment You had better go and lie down

Ill go directly Gerald promised Can I speak to you for one moment
first

Speak to me Mr Fentolin repeated a little wonderingly My dear
Gerald is there ever a moment when I am not wholly at your service

That fellow Dunster on the platform the first moment I spoke to him
made me feel like a cur the boy said with a sudden access of vigour
in his tone I told him I was on my way to a golf tournament and he
pointed to the news about the war Is it true uncle that we may be at
war at any moment

Mr Fentolin sighed

A terrible reflection my dear boy he admitted softly but alas
the finger of probability points that way

Then what about me Gerald exclaimed I dont want to complain but
listen You dragged me home from a public school before I could even
join my cadet corps Youve kept me banging around here with a tutor
You wouldnt let me go to the university Youve stopped my entering
either of the services I am nineteen years old and useless Do you know
what I should do tomorrow if war broke out Enlist Its the only thing
left for me

Mr Fentolin was shocked

My dear boy he exclaimed You must not talk like that I am quite
sure that it would break your mothers heart Enlist indeed Nothing of
the sort You are part of the civilian population of the country

Civilian population be dd the boy suddenly cried white with rage
Uncle forgive me I have stood all I can bear If you wont let me go
in for the armyI could pass my exams tomorrowIm off Ill enlist
without waiting for the war I cant bear this idle life any longer

Mr Fentolin leaned a little forward in his chair

Gerald he said softly

The boy turned his head turned it unwillingly He had the air of
a caged animal obeying the word of his keeper A certain savage
uncouthness seemed to have fallen upon him during the last few minutes
There was something almost like a snarl in his expression

Gerald Mr Fentolin repeated

Then it was obvious that there was something between those two some
memory or some living thing seldom if ever to be spoken of and yet
always present The boy began to tremble

Youre a little overwrought Gerald Mr Fentolin declared Sit
quietly in my easychair for a few moments Wait until I have examined
Mr Dunsters belongings Ah Meekins has been prompt indeed

There was a stealthy tap at the door Meekins entered with the small
dressingcase in his hand He brought it over to his masters chair Mr
Fentolin pointed to the floor

Open it there Meekins he directed I fancy that the pocketbook you
are carrying will prove more interesting We will just glance through
the dressingcase first Thank you Yes you can lay the things upon the
floor A man of Spartanlike life I should imagine Mr Dunster A
spare toothbrush though I am glad to see Pyjamas of most unattractive
pattern And what a taste in shirts Nothing but wearing apparel and
singularly little of that I fancy

The dressingcase was empty its contents upon the floor Mr Fentolin
held out his hand and took the pocketbook which Meekins had been
carrying It was an ordinary morocco affair similar to those issued by
American banking houses to enclose letters of credit One side of it was
filled with notes Mr Fentolin withdrew them and glanced them through

Dear me he murmured No wonder our friend engages special trains He
travels like a prince indeed Two thousand pounds or near it in this
little compartment And here I see a letter a sealed letter with no
address

He held it out in front of him It was a long commercial envelope of
ordinary type and although the flap was secured with a blob of sealing
wax there was no particular impression upon it

We can match this envelope I think Mr Fentolin said softly The
seal we can copy I think that for the sake of others we must discover
the cause for this hurried journey on the part of Mr John P Dunster

With his long delicate forefinger Mr Fentolin slit the envelope and
withdrew the single sheet of paper which it contained There were
a dozen lines of written matter and what appeared to be a dozen
signatures appended Mr Fentolin read it at first with ordinary
interest Then a change came The look of a man drawn out of himself
drawn out of all knowledge of his surroundings or his present state
stole into his face Literally he became transfixed The delicate
fingers of his left hand gripped the sides of his little carriage
His eyes shone as though those few written lines upon which they were
riveted were indeed some message from an unknown an unimagined world
Yet no word ever passed his lips There came a time when the tension
seemed a little relaxed With fingers which still trembled he folded up
the sheet and replaced it in the envelope He guarded it with both
his hands and sat quite still Neither Gerald nor his servant moved
Somehow the sense of Mr Fentolins suppressed excitement seemed to
have become communicated to them It was a little tableau broken at
last by Mr Fentolin himself

I should like he said turning to Gerald to be alone It may
interest you to know that this document which Mr Dunster has brought
across the seas and which I hold in my hands is the most amazing
message of modern times

Gerald rose to his feet

What are you going to do about it he asked abruptly Do you want any
one in from the telegraph room

Mr Fentolin shook his head slowly

At present he announced I am going to reflect Meekins my chair
to the north windowso I am going to sit here he went on and I am
going to look across the sea and reflect A very fortunate storm after
all I think which kept Mr John P Dunster from the Harwich boat last
night Leave me Gerald for a time Stand behind my chair Meekins and
see that no one enters

Mr Fentolin sat in his chair his hands still gripping the wonderful
document his eyes travelling over the ocean now flecked with sunlight
His eyes were fixed upon the horizon He looked steadily eastward



CHAPTER VI

Mr John P Dunster opened his eyes upon strange surroundings He found
himself lying upon a bed deliciously soft with laceedged sheets and
lavenderperfumed bed hangings Through the discreetly opened upper
window came a pleasant and ozoneladen breeze The furniture in the
room was mostly of an oldfashioned type some of it of oak curiously
carved and most of it surmounted with a coat of arms The apartment was
lofty and of almost palatial proportions The whole atmosphere of the
place breathed comfort and refinement The only thing of which he did
not wholly approve was the face of the nurse who rose silently to her
feet at his murmured question

Where am I

She felt his forehead altered a bandage for a moment and took his
wrist between her fingers

You have been ill she said There was a railway accident You are to
lie quite still and not say a word I am going to fetch the doctor now
He wished to see you directly you spoke

Mr Dunster dozed again for several moments When he reopened his eyes
a man was standing by his bedside a short man with a black beard
and goldrimmed glasses Mr Dunster in this first stage of his
convalescence was perhaps difficult to please for he did not like the
look of the doctor either

Please tell me where I am he begged

You have been in a railway accident the doctor told him and you
were brought here afterwards

In a railway accident Mr Dunster repeated Ah yes I remember I
took a special to HarwichI remember now Where is my dressingbag

It is here by the side of your bed

And my pocketbook

It is on your dressingtable

Have any of my things been looked at

Only so far as was necessary to discover your identity the doctor
assured him Dont talk too much The nurse is bringing you some beef
tea

When Mr Dunster enquired shall I be able to continue my journey

That depends upon many things the doctor replied

Mr Dunster drank his beef tea and felt considerably stronger His head
still ached but his memory was returning

There was a young man in the carriage with me he asked presently
Mr Gerald something or other I think he said his name was

Fentolin the doctor said He is unhurt This is his relatives house
to which you have been brought

Mr Dunster lay for a time with knitted brows Once more the name of
Fentolin seemed somehow familiar to him seemed somehow to bring with it
to his memory a note of warning He looked around the room fretfully
He looked into the nurses face which he disliked exceedingly and he
looked at the doctor whom he was beginning to detest

Whose house exactly is this he demanded

This is St Davids Hallthe home of Mr Miles Fentolin the doctor
told him The young gentleman with whom you were travelling is his
nephew

Can I send a telegram Mr Dunster asked a little abruptly

Without a doubt the doctor replied Mr Fentolin desired me to ask
you if there was any one whom you would like to apprise of your safety

Again the man upon the bed lay quite still with knitted brows There
was surely something familiar about that name Was it his fevered fancy
or was there also something a little sinister

The nurse who had glided from the room came back presently with
some telegraph forms Mr Dunster held out his hand for them and then
hesitated

Can you tell me any date Doctor upon which I can rely upon leaving
here

You will probably be well enough to travel on the third day from now
the doctor assured him

The third day Mr Dunster muttered Very well

He wrote out three telegrams and passed them over

One he said is to New York one to The Hague and one to London
There was plenty of money in my pocket Perhaps you will find it and pay
for these

Is there anything more the doctor asked that can be done for your
comfort

Nothing at present Mr Dunster replied My head aches now but I
think that I shall want to leave before three days are up Are you the
doctor in the neighbourhood

Sarson shook his head

I am physician to Mr Fentolins household he answered quietly I
live here Mr Fentolin is himself somewhat of an invalid and requires
constant medical attention

Mr Dunster contemplated the speaker steadfastly

You will forgive me he said I am an American and I am used to
plain speech I am quite unused to being attended by strange doctors I
understand that you are not in general practice now Might I ask if you
are fully qualified

I am an MD of London the doctor replied You can make yourself
quite easy as to my qualifications It would not suit Mr Fentolins
purpose to entrust himself to the care of any one without a reputation

He left the room and Mr Dunster closed his eyes His slumbers
however were not altogether peaceful ones All the time there seemed to
be a hammering inside his head and from somewhere back in his obscured
memory the name of Fentolin seemed to be continually asserting itself
From somewhere or other the amazing sense which sometimes gives warning
of danger to men of adventure seemed to have opened its feelers He
rested because he was exhausted but even in his sleep he was ill at
ease

The doctor with the telegrams in his hand made his way down a splendid
staircase past the long picture gallery where masterpieces of Van Dyck
and Rubens frowned and leered down upon him descended the final stretch
of broad oak stairs crossed the hall and entered his masters rooms
Mr Fentolin was sitting before the open window an easel in front of
him a palette in his left hand painting with deft swift touches

Ah he exclaimed without looking around it is my friend the doctor
my friend Sarson MD of London LRCP and all the rest of it He
brings with him the odour of the sick room For a moment or two just
for a moment dear friend do not disturb me Do not bring any alien
thoughts into my brain I am absorbed you seeabsorbed It is a
strange problem of colour this

He was silent for several moments glancing repeatedly out of the window
and back to his canvas painting all the time with swift and delicate
precision

Meekins who stands behind my chair Mr Fentolin continued even
Meekins is entranced He has a soul my friend Sarson although you
might not think it He too sees sometimes the colour in the skies the
glitter upon the sands the clear sweet purity of those long stretches
of virgin water Meekins I believe has a soul only he likes better to
see these things grow under his masters touch than to wander about and
solve their riddles for himself

The man remained perfectly immovable Not a feature twitched Yet it
was a fact that although he stood where Mr Fentolin could not possibly
observe him he never removed his gaze from the canvas

You see my medical friend that there has been a great tide in the
night following upon the flood Even our small landmarks are shifted
Soon in my little carriage I shall ride down to the Tower I shall sit
there and I shall watch the sea I think that this evening with the
turn of the tide the spray may reach even to my windows there I
shall paint again There is always something fresh in the sea you
knowalways something fresh in the sea Like a human faceangry or
pleased sullen or joyful Some people like to paint the sea at its
calmest and most beautiful Some people like to see happy faces around
them It is not every one who appreciates the other things It is not
quite like that with me eh Sarson

His hand fell to his side Momentarily he had finished his work He
turned around and eyed the doctor who stood in taciturn silence

Answer Answer me he insisted

The doctors gloomy face seemed darker still

You have spoken the truth Mr Fentolin he admitted You are not one
of the vulgar herd who love to consort with pleasure and happiness You
are one of those who understand the beauty of unhappinessin others
he added with faint emphasis

Mr Fentolin smiled His face became almost like the face of one of
those angels of the great Italian master

How well you know me he murmured My humble effort Doctorhow do
you like it

The doctor bent over the canvas

I know nothing about art he said a little roughly Your work seems
to me clevera little grotesque perhaps a little straining after the
hard plain things which threaten Nothing of the idealist in your work
Mr Fentolin

Mr Fentolin studied the canvas himself for a moment

A clever man Sarson he remarked coolly but no courtier Never
mind my work pleases me It gives me a passing sensation of happiness
Now what about our patient

He recovers the doctor pronounced From my short examination I
should say that he had the constitution of an ox I have told him that
he will be up in three days As a matter of fact he will be able if he
wants to to walk out of the house tomorrow

Mr Fentolin shook his head

We cannot spare him quite so soon he declared We must avail
ourselves of this wonderful chance afforded us by my brilliant young
nephew We must keep him with us for a little time What is it that you
have in your hands Doctor Telegrams I think Let me look at them

The doctor held them out Mr Fentolin took them eagerly between his
thin delicate fingers Suddenly his face darkened and became like the
face of a spoilt and angry child

Cipher he exclaimed furiously A cipher which he knows so well as to
remember it too Never mind it will be easy to decode It will amuse
me during the afternoon Very good Sarson I will take charge of
these

You do not wish anything dispatched

Nothing at present Mr Fentolin sighed It will be well I think
for the poor man to remain undisturbed by any communications from his
friends Is he restless at all

He wants to get on with his journey

We shall see Mr Fentolin remarked Now feel my pulse Sarson How
am I this morning

The doctor held the thin wrist for a moment between his fingers and let
it go

In perfect health as usual he announced grimly

Ah but you cannot be sure Mr Fentolin protested My tongue if you
please

He put it out

Excellent

We must make quite certain Mr Fentolin continued There are so
many people who would miss me My place in the world would not be easily
filed Undo my waistcoat Sarson Feel my heart please Feel carefully
I can see the end of your stethoscope in your pocket Dont scamp it
I fancied this morning when I was lying here alone that there was
something almost like a palpitationa quicker beat Be very careful
Sarson Now

The doctor made his examination with impassive face Then he stepped
back

There is no change in your condition Mr Fentolin he announced The
palpitation you spoke of is a mistake You are in perfect health

Mr Fentolin sighed gently

Then he said I will now amuse myself by a gentle ride down to the
Tower You are entirely satisfied Sarson You are keeping nothing back
from me

The doctor looked at him with grim impassive face There is nothing to
keep back he declared You have the constitution of a cowboy There
is no reason why you should not live for another thirty years

Mr Fentolin sighed as though a weight had been removed from his heart

I will now he decided reaching forward for the handle of his
carriage go down to the Tower It is just possible that a few days
seclusion might be good for our guest

The doctor turned silently away There was no one there to see his
expression as he walked towards the door




CHAPTER VII

The two men who were supping together in the grillroom at the Cafe Milan
were talking with a seriousness which seemed a little out of keeping
with the roseshaded lamps and the swaying music of the band from the
distant restaurant Their conversation had started some hours before in
the club smokingroom and had continued intermittently throughout the
evening It had received a further stimulus when Richard Hamel who had
bought an Evening Standard on their way from the theatre a few minutes
ago came across a certain paragraph in it which he read aloud

Hanged if I understand things over here nowadays Reggie he
declared laying the paper down Heres another Englishman imprisoned
in Germanythis time at a place no one ever heard of before I wont
try to pronounce it What does it all mean Its all very well to shrug
your shoulders but when there are eighteen arrests within one week on a
charge of espionage there must be something up

For the first time Reginald Kinsley seemed inclined to discuss the
subject seriously He drew the paper towards him and read the little
paragraph word by word Then he gave some further order to an attentive
maitre dhotel and glanced around to be sure that they were not
overheard

Look here Dick old chap he said you are just back from abroad
and you are not quite in the hang of things yet Let me ask you a plain
question What do you think of us all

Think of you Hamel repeated a little doubtfully Do you mean
personally

Take it any way you like Kinsley replied Look at me Nine years
ago we played cricket in the same eleven I dont look much like cricket
now do I

Hamel looked at his companion thoughtfully For a man who was doubtless
still young Kinsley had certainly an aged appearance The hair about
his temples was grey there were lines about his mouth and forehead He
had the air of one who lived in an atmosphere of anxiety

To me Hamel declared frankly you look worried If I hadnt heard so
much of the success of your political career and all the rest of it I
should have thought that things were going badly with you

Theyve gone well enough with me personally Kinsley admitted but
Im only one of many Politics isnt the game it was The Foreign Office
especially is ageing its men fast these few years Weve been going
through hell Hamel and we are up against it now hard up against it

The slight smile passed from the lips of Hamels sunburnt goodnatured
face He himself seemed to become infected with something of his
companions anxiety

Theres nothing seriously wrong is there Reggie he asked

Dick said Kinsley with a sigh I am afraid there is Its very
seldom I talk as plainly as this to any one but you are just the person
one can unburden oneself to a little and to tell you the truth its
rather a relief As you say these eighteen arrests in one week do mean
something Half of the Englishmen who have been arrested are to my
certain knowledge connected with our Secret Service and they have
been arrested in many cases where there are no fortifications worth
speaking of within fifty miles on one pretext or another The fact of
the matter is that things are going on in Germany just at the present
moment the knowledge of which is of vital interest to us

Then these arrests Hamel remarked are really bona fide

Without a doubt his companion agreed I only wonder there have not
been more I am telling you what is a pretty open secret when I tell
you that there is a conference due to be held this week at some place or
another on the continentI dont know where myselfwhich will have a
very important bearing upon our future We know just as much as that and
not much more

A conference between whom Hamel asked

Kinsley dropped his voice almost to a whisper

We know he replied that a very great man from Russia a greater
still from France a minister from Austria a statesman from Italy and
an envoy from Japan have been invited to meet a German minister whose
name I will not mention even to you The subject of their proposed
discussion has never been breathed One can only suspect When I tell
you that no one from this country was invited to the conference I think
you will be able broadly speaking to divine its purpose The clouds
have been gathering for a good many years and we have only buried our
heads a little deeper in the sands We have had our chances and wilfully
chucked them away National Service or three more army corps four years
ago would have brought us an alliance which would have meant absolute
safety for twentyone years You know what happened We have lived
through many rumours and escaped more narrowly than most people
realise a great many dangers but there is every indication this time
that the end is really coming

And what will the end be Hamel enquired eagerly

Kinsley shrugged his shoulders and paused while their glasses were
filled with wine

It will be in the nature of a diplomatic coup he said presently Of
that much I feel sure England will be forced into such a position that
she will have no alternative left but to declare war That of course
will be the end of us With our ridiculously small army and absolutely
no sane scheme for home defence we shall lose all that we have worth
fighting forour colonieswithout being able to strike a blow The
thing is so ridiculously obvious It has been admitted time after time
by every sea lord and every commanderinchief We have listened to it
and thats all Our fleet is needed under present conditions to protect
our own shores There isnt a single battleship which could be safely
spared Canada Australia New Zealand Egypt India must take care
of themselves I wonder when a nation of the world ever played fast and
loose with great possessions as we have done

This is a nice sort of thing to hear almost ones first night in
England Hamel remarked a little gloomily Tell me some more about
this conference Are you sure that your information is reliable

Our information is miserably scanty Kinsley admitted Curiously
enough the man who must know most about the whole thing is an
Englishman one of the most curious mortals in the British Empire A spy
of his succeeded in learning more than any of our people and without
being arrested too

And who is this singular person Hamel asked

A man of whom you I suppose never heard Kinsley replied His name
is FentolinMiles Fentolinand he lives somewhere down in Norfolk He
is one of the strangest characters that ever lived stranger than any
effort of fiction I ever met with He was in the Foreign Office once
and every one was predicting for him a brilliant career Then there
was an accidentlet me see it must have been some six or seven years
agoand he had to have both his legs amputated No one knows exactly
how the accident happened and there was always a certain amount of
mystery connected with it Since then he has buried himself in the
country I dont think in fact that he ever moves outside his place
but somehow or other he has managed to keep in touch with all the
political movements of the day

Fentolin Hamel repeated softly to himself Tell me whereabouts does
he live

Quite a wonderful place in Norfolk I believe somewhere near the sea
Ive forgotten the name for the moment He has had wireless telegraphy
installed he has a telegraph office in the house halfadozen private
wires and they say that he spends an immense amount of money keeping in
touch with foreign politics His excuse is that he speculates largely
as I dare say he does but just lately Kinsley went on more slowly
he has been an object of anxiety to all of us It was he who sent the
first agent out to Germany to try and discover at least where this
conference was to be held His man returned in safety and he has one
over there now who has not been arrested We seem to have lost nearly
all of ours

Do you mean to say that this man Fentolin actually possesses
information which the Government hasnt as to the intentions of foreign
Powers Hamel asked

Kinsley nodded There was a slight flush upon his pallid cheeks

He not only has it but he doesnt mean to part with it A few hundred
years ago when the rulers of this country were men with blood in their
veins hed have been given just one chance to tell all he knew and
hung as a traitor if he hesitated We dont do that sort of thing
nowadays We rather go in for preserving traitors We permit them even
in our own House of Commons However I dont want to depress you and
play the alarmist so soon after your return to London I dare say the
old countryll muddle along through our time

Dont be foolish Hamel begged Theres no other subject of
conversation could interest me half as much Have you formed any idea
yourself as to the nature of this conference

We all have an idea Kinsley replied grimly India for Russia a
large slice of China for Japan with probably Australia thrown in
AlsaceLorraine for Frances neutrality Theres bribery for you Whats
to become of poor England then Our friends are only human after all
and its merely a question of handing over to them sufficient spoil
They must consider themselves first thats the first duty of their
politicians towards their country

You mean to say Hamel asked that you seriously believe that a
conference is on the point of being held at which France and Russia are
to be invited to consider suggestions like this

I am afraid theres no doubt about it Kinsley declared Their
ambassadors in London profess to know nothing That of course is their
reasonable attitude but theres no doubt whatever that the conference
has been planned I should say that tonight we are nearer war if we
can summon enough spirit to fight than we have been since Fashoda

Queer if I have returned just in time for the scrap Hamel remarked
thoughtfully I was in the Militia once so I expect I can get a job
if theres any fighting

I can get you a better job than fightingone you can start on
tomorrow too Kinsley announced abruptly that is if you really want
to help

Of course I do Hamel insisted Im on for anything

You say that you are entirely your own master for the next six months

Or as much longer as I like Hamel assented No plans at all except
that I might drift round to the Norfolk coast and look up some of
the places where the governor used to paint Theres a queer little
houseSt Davids Tower I believe they call itwhich really belongs
to me It was given to my father or rather he bought it from a man
who I think must have been some relative of your friend I feel sure the
name was Fentolin

Reginald Kinsley set down his wineglass

Is your St Davids Tower anywhere near a place called Salthouse he
asked reflectively

Thats the name of the village Hamel admitted My father used to
spend quite a lot of time in those parts and painted at least a dozen
pictures down there

This is a coincidence Reginald Kinsley declared lighting a
cigarette I think if I were you Dick Id go down and claim my
property

Tired of me already Hamel asked smiling

Reginald Kinsley knocked the ash from his cigarette

It isnt that The fact is that job I was speaking to you about was
simply this We want some one to go down to Salthousenot exactly as a
spy you know but some one who has his wits about him We are all of us
very curious about this man Fentolin There are no end of rumours which
I wont mention to you for they might only put you off the scent But
the man seems to be always intriguing It wouldnt matter so much if he
were our friend or if he were simply a financier but to tell you the
truth we have cause to suspect him

But hes an Englishman surely Hamel asked The Fentolin who was my
fathers friend was just a very wealthy Norfolk squireone of the best
from all I have heard

Miles Fentolin is an Englishman Kinsley admitted It is true too
that he comes of a very ancient Norfolk family It doesnt do however
to build too much upon that From all I can learn of him he is a sort
of Puck a professional mischiefmaker I dont suppose theres anything
an outsider could find out which would be really useful to us but
all the same if I had the time I should certainly go down to Norfolk
myself

The conversation drifted away for a while Mutual acquaintances entered
there were several introductions and it was not until the two found
themselves together in Kinsleys rooms for a few minutes before parting
that they were alone again Hamel returned then once more to the
subject

Reggie he said if you think it would be of the slightest use Ill
go down to Salthouse tomorrow I am rather keen on going there anyway
I am absolutely fed up with life here already

Its just what I want you to do Kinsley said I am afraid Fentolin
is a little too clever for you to get on the right side of him but if
you could only get an idea as to what his game is down there it would
be a great help You see the fellow cant have gone into all this sort
of thing blindfold Weve lost several very useful agents abroad and
two from New York whove gone into his pay There must be a method in
it somewhere If it really ends with his financial operationswhy
all right Thats very likely what itll come to but we should like to
know The merest hint would be useful

Ill do my best Hamel promised In any case it will be just the few
days holiday I was looking forward to

Kinsley helped himself to whisky and soda and turned towards his friend

Heres luck to you Dick Take care of yourself All sorts of things
may happen you know Old man Fentolin may take a fancy to you and tell
you secrets that any statesman in Europe would be glad to hear He may
tell you why this conference is being held and what the result will be
You may be the first to hear of our coming fall Well heres to you
anyway Drop me a line if youve anything to report

Cheero Hamel answered as he set down his empty tumbler Astonishing
how keen I feel about this little adventure Im perfectly sick of the
humdrum life I have been leading the last week and you do sort of take
one back to the Arabian Nights you know Reggie I am never quite sure
whether to take you seriously or not

Kinsley smiled as he held his friends hand for a moment

Dick he said earnestly if only youd believe it the adventures in
the Arabian Nights were as nothing compared with the presentday
drama of foreign politics You see weve learned to conceal things
nowadaysto smooth them over to play the part of ordinary citizens to
the world while we tug at the underhand levers in our secret moments
Good night Good luck




CHAPTER VIII

Richard Hamel although he certainly had not the appearance of a person
afflicted with nerves gave a slight start For the last halfhour
during which time the train had made no stop he had been alone in his
compartment Yet to his surprise he was suddenly aware that the seat
opposite to him had been noiselessly taken by a girl whose eyes also
were fixed with curious intentness upon the broad expanse of marshland
and sands across which the train was slowly making its way Hamel had
spent a great many years abroad and his first impulse was to speak with
the unexpected stranger He forgot for a moment that he was in England
travelling in a firstclass carriage and pointed with his left hand
towards the sea

Queer country this isnt it he remarked pleasantly Do you know
I never heard you come in It gave me quite a start when I found that I
had a fellowpassenger

She looked at him with a certain amount of still surprise a look which
he returned just as steadfastly because even in those few seconds he
was conscious of that strange selective interest certainly unaccounted
for by his own impressions of her appearance She seemed to him at that
first glance very far indeed from being goodlooking according to any
of the standards by which he had measured good looks She was thin too
thin for his taste and she carried herself with an aloofness to which
he was unaccustomed Her cheeks were quite pale her hair of a soft
shade of brown her eyes grey and sad She gave him altogether an
impression of colourlessness and he had been living in a land where
colour and vitality meant much Her speech too in its very restraint
fell strangely upon his ears

I have been travelling in an uncomfortable compartment she observed
I happened to notice when passing along the corridor that yours was
empty In any case I am getting out at the next station

So am I he replied still cheerfully I suppose the next station is
St Davids

She made no answer but so far as her expression counted for anything at
all she was a little surprised Her eyes considered him for a moment
Hamel was tall well over six feet powerfully made with good features
clear eyes and complexion unusually sunburnt He wore a flannel collar
of unfamiliar shape and his clothes although they were neat enough
were of a pattern and cut obviously designed to afford the maximum of
ease and comfort with the minimum regard to appearance He wore too
very thick boots and his hands gave one the impression that they
were seldom gloved His voice was pleasant and he had the easy
selfconfidence of a person sure of himself in the world She put him
down as a colonialperhaps an Americanbut his rank in life mystified
her

This seems the queerest stretch of country he went on long spits of
sand jutting right out into the sea dikes and creeksmiles and miles
of them Now I wonder is it low tide or high Low I should think
because of the seashine on the sand there

She glanced out of the window

The tide she told him is almost at its lowest

You live in this neighbourhood perhaps he enquired

I do she assented

Sort of country one might get very fond of he ventured

She glanced at him from the depths of her grey eyes

Do you think so she rejoined coldly For my part I hate it

He was surprised at the unexpected emphasis of her tonethe first time
indeed that she had shown any signs of interest in the conversation

Kind of dull I suppose you find it he remarked pensively looking
out across the waste of lavendergrown marshes sand hummocks piled
with seaweed and a far distant line of pebbled shore And yet I dont
know I have lived by the sea a good deal and however monotonous it may
seem at first theres always plenty of change really Tide and wind do
such wonderful work

She too was looking out now towards the sea

Oh it isnt exactly that she said quietly I am quite willing to
admit what all the tourists and chance visitors call the fascination
of these places I happen to dislike them that is all Perhaps it is
because I live here because I see them day by day perhaps because the
sight of them and the thought of them have become woven into my life

She was talking half to herself For a moment even the knowledge of his
presence had escaped her Hamel however did not realise that fact He
welcomed her confidence as a sign of relaxation from the frigidity of
her earlier demeanour

That seems hard he observed sympathetically It seems odd to
hear you talk like that too Your life surely ought to be pleasant
enough

She looked away from the sea into his face Although the genuine
interest which she saw there and the kindly expression of his eyes
disarmed annoyance she still stiffened slightly

Why ought it

The question was a little bewildering

Why because you are young and a girl he replied Its natural to be
cheerful isnt it

Is it she answered listlessly I cannot tell I have not had much
experience

How old are you he asked bluntly

This time it certainly seemed as though her reply would contain some
rebuke for his curiosity She glanced once more into his face however
and the instinctive desire to administer that welldeserved snub
passed away He was so obviously interested his question was asked
so naturally that its spice of impertinence was as though it had not
existed

I am twentyone she told him

And how long have you lived here

Since I left boardingschool four years ago

Anywhere near where I am going to bury myself for a time I wonder he
went on

That depends she replied Our only neighbours are the Lorneybrookes
of Market Burnham Are you going there

He shook his head

Ive got a little shanty of my own he explained quite close to St
Davids Station Ive never even seen it yet

She vouchsafed some slight show of curiosity

Where is this shanty as you call it she asked him

I really havent the faintest idea he replied I am looking for it
now All I can tell you is that it stands just out of reach of the full
tides on a piece of rock dead on the beach and about a mile from the
station It was built originally for a coastguard station and meant to
hold a lifeboat but they found they could never launch the lifeboat
when they had it so the man to whom all the foreshore and most of
the land around here belongsa Mr Fentolin I believesold it to my
father I expect the place has tumbled to pieces by this time but I
thought Id have a look at it

She was gazing at him steadfastly now with parted lips

What is your name she demanded

Richard Hamel

Hamel

She repeated it lingeringly It seemed quite unfamiliar

Was your father a great friend of Mr Fentolins then she asked

I believe so in a sort of way he answered My father was Hamel the
artist you know They made him an RA some time before he died He
used to come out here and live in a tent Then Mr Fentolin let him use
this place and finally sold it to him My father used often to speak to
me about it before he died

Tell me she enquired I do not know much about these matters but
have you any papers to prove that it was sold to your father and that
you have the right to occupy it now when you choose

He smiled

Of course I have he assured her As a matter of fact as none of us
have been here for so long I thought Id better bring the titledeed
or whatever they call it along with me Its with the rest of my traps
at Norwich Oh the place belongs to me right enough he went on
smiling Dont tell me that any ones pulled it down or that its
disappeared from the face of the earth

No she said it still remains there When we are round the next
curve I think I can show it to you But every one has forgotten I
think that it doesnt belong to Mr Fentolin still He uses it himself
very often

What for

She looked at her questioner quite steadfastly quite quietly
speechlessly A curious uneasiness crept into his thoughts There were
mysterious things in her face He knew from that moment that she too
directly or indirectly was concerned with those strange happenings at
which Kinsley had hinted He knew that there were things which she was
keeping from him now

Mr Fentolin uses one of the rooms as a studio He likes to paint there
and be near the sea she explained But for the rest I do not know I
never go near the place

I am afraid he remarked after a few moments of silence that I
shall be a little unpopular with Mr Fentolin Perhaps I ought to have
written first but then of course I had no idea that any one was
making use of the place

I do not understand she said how you can possibly expect to come
down like this and live there without any preparation

Why not

You havent any servants nor any furniture nor things to cook with

He laughed

Oh I am an old campaigner he assured her I meant to pick up a few
oddments in the village I dont suppose I shall stay very long anyhow
but I thought Id like to have a look at the place Bytheby what sort
of a man is Mr Fentolin

Again there was that curious expression in her eyes an expression
almost of secret terror this time not wholly concealed He could have
sworn that her hands were cold

He met with an accident many years ago she said slowly Both his
legs were amputated He spends his life in a little carriage which he
wheels about himself

Poor fellow Hamel exclaimed with a strong mans ready sympathy for
suffering That is just as much as I have heard about him Is he a
decent sort of fellow in other ways I suppose anyhow if he has really
taken a fancy to my little shanty I shall have to give it up

Then as it seemed to him for the first time real life leaped into
her face She leaned towards him Her tone was half commanding half
imploring her manner entirely confidential

Dont she begged It is yours Claim it Live in it Do anything you
like with it but take it away from Mr Fentolin

Hamel was speechless He sat a little forward a hand on either
knee his mouth ungracefully open an expression of blank and utter
bewilderment in his face For the first time he began to have vague
doubts concerning this young lady Everything about her had been so
strange her quiet entrance into the carriage her unusual manner of
talking and finally this last passionate inexplicable appeal

I am afraid he said at last I dont quite understand You say the
poor fellow has taken a fancy to the place and likes being there Well
it isnt much of a catch for me anyway Im rather a wanderer and I
dare say I shant be back in these parts again for years Why shouldnt
I let him have it if he wants it Its no loss to me Im not a painter
you know like my father

She seemed on the point of making a further appeal Her lips even were
parted her head a little thrown back And then she stopped She said
nothing The silence lasted so long that he became almost embarrassed

You will forgive me if I am a little dense wont you he begged To
tell you the truth he went on smiling Ive got a sort of feeling
that Id like to do anything you ask me Now wont you just explain a
little more clearly what you mean and Ill blow up the old place sky
high if its any pleasure to you

She seemed suddenly to have reverted to her former selfthe cold and
colourless young woman who had first taken the seat opposite to his

Mine was a very foolish request she admitted quietly I am sorry
that I ever made it It was just an impulse because the little building
we were speaking of has been connected with one or two very disagreeable
episodes Nevertheless it was foolish of me How long did you think of
staying therethat is she added with a faint smile providing that
you find it possible to prove your claim and take up possession

Oh just for a week or so he answered lightly and as to regaining
possession of it he went on a slightly pugnacious instinct stirring
him I dont imagine that therell be any difficulty about that

Really she murmured

Not that I want to make myself disagreeable he continued but the
Tower is mine right enough even if I have let it remain unoccupied for
some time

She let down the windowa task in which he hastened to assist her
A rush of salt cold air swept into the compartment He sniffed it
eagerly

Wonderful he exclaimed

She stretched out a long arm and pointed Away in the distance on the
summit of a line of pebbled shore standing as it seemed sheer over
the sea was a little black speck

That she said is the Tower

He changed his position and leaned out of the window

Well its a queer little place he remarked It doesnt look worth
quarrelling over does it

And that she went on directing his attention to the hill is Mr
Fentolins home St Davids Hall

For several moments he made no remark at all There was something
curiously impressive in that sudden sweep up from the sealine the
strange miniature mountain standing in the middle of the marshes with
its treecrowned background and the long weatherbeaten front of the
house turned bravely to the sea

I never saw anything like it he declared Why its barely a quarter
of a mile from the sea isnt it

A little more than that It is a strangely situated abode isnt it

Wonderful he agreed with emphasis I must study the geological
formation of that hill he continued with interest Why it looks
almost like an island now

That is because of the floods she told him Even at high tide the
creeks never reach so far as the back there All the water you see
stretching away inland is flood waterthe result of the storm I
suppose This is where you get out she concluded rising to her feet

She turned away with the slightest nod A maid was already awaiting her
at the door of the compartment Hamel was suddenly conscious of the fact
that he disliked her going immensely

We shall perhaps meet again during the next few days he remarked

She half turned her head Her expression was scarcely encouraging

I hope she said that you will not be disappointed in your
quarters

Hamel followed her slowly on to the platform saw her escorted to a
very handsome motorcar by an obsequious stationmaster and watched
the former disappear down the stretch of straight road which led to the
hill Then with a stick in one hand and the handbag which was his sole
luggage in the other he left the station and turned seaward




CHAPTER IX

Mr Fentolin surrounded by his satellites was seated in his chair
before the writingtable There were present in the room most of the
people important to him in his somewhat singular life A few feet away
in characteristic attitude stood Meekins Doctor Sarson with his hands
behind him was looking out of the window At the further end of the
table stood a confidential telegraph clerk who was just departing with
a little sheaf of messages By his side with a notebook in her hand
stood Mr Fentolins private secretarya whitehaired woman with
a strangely transparent skin and light brown eyes dressed in somber
black a woman who might have been of any age from thirty to fifty
Behind her was a middleaged man whose position in the household no one
was quite sure abouta cleanshaven man whose name was Ryan and
who might very well have been once an actor or a clergyman In the
background stood Henderson the perfect butler

It is perhaps opportune Mr Fentolin said quietly that you all whom
I trust should be present here together I wish you to understand one
thing You have I believe in my employ learned the gift of silence It
is to be exercised with regard to a certain visitor brought here by my
nephew a visitor whom I regret to say is now lying seriously ill

There was absolute silence Doctor Sarson alone turned from the window
as though about to speak but met Mr Fentolins eye and at once resumed
his position

I rely upon you all Mr Fentolin continued softly Henderson you
perhaps have the most difficult task for you have the servants to
control Nevertheless I rely upon you also If one word of this
visitors presence here leaks out even so far as the village out they
go every one of them I will not have a servant in the place who does
not respect my wishes You can give any reason you like for my orders
It is a whim I have whims and I choose to pay for them You are all
better paid than any man breathing could pay you In return I ask only
for your implicit obedience

He stretched out his hand and took a cigarette from a curiously carved
ivory box which stood by his side He tapped it gently upon the table
and looked up

I think sir Henderson said respectfully that I can answer for the
servants Being mostly foreigners they see little or nothing of the
village people

No one else made any remark It was strange to see how dominated they
all were by that queer little fragment of humanity whose head scarcely
reached a foot above the table before which he sat They departed
silently almost abjectly dismissed with a single wave of the hand Mr
Fentolin beckoned his secretary to remain She came a little nearer

Sit down Lucy he ordered

She seated herself a few feet away from him Mr Fentolin watched her
for several moments He himself had his back to the light The woman on
the other hand was facing it The windows were high and the curtains
were drawn back to their fullest extent A cold stream of northern
light fell upon her face Mr Fentolin gazed at her and nodded his head
slightly

My dear Lucy he declared you are wonderfula perfect cameo a gem
To look at you now with your delightful white hair and your flawless
skin one would never believe that you had ever spoken a single angry
word that you had ever felt the blood flow through your veins or that
your eyes had ever looked upon the gentle things of life

She looked at him still without speech The immobility of her face was
indeed a marvellous thing Mr Fentolins expression darkened

Sometimes he murmured softly I think that if I had strong
fingersreally strong fingers you know LucyI should want to take
you by the throat and hold you tighter and tighter until your breath
came fast and your eyes came out from their shadows

She turned over a few pages of her notebook To all appearance she had
not heard a word

Today she announced is the fourth of April Shall I send out
the various checks to those men in Paris New York Frankfort St
Petersburg and Tokio

You can send the checks he told her Be sure that you draw them
as usual upon the Credit Lyonaise and in the name you know of Say
to Lebonaitre of Paris that you consider his last reports faulty No
mention was made of Monsieur Cs visit to the Russian Embassy or of
the supper party given to the Baron von Erlstein by a certain Russian
gentleman Warn him if you please that reports with such omissions are
useless to me

She wrote a few words in her book

You made a note of that

She raised her head

I do not make mistakes she said

His eyebrows were drawn together This was his work he told himself
this magnificent physical subjection Yet his inability to stir her
sometimes maddened him

You know who is in this house he asked You know the name of my
unknown guest

I know nothing she replied His presence does not interest me

Supposing I desire you to know he persisted leaning a little
forward Supposing I tell you that it is your duty to know

Then she said I should tell you that I believe him to be the
special envoy from New York to The Hague or whatever place on the
Continent this coming conference is to be held at

Right woman Mr Fentolin answered sharply Right It is the special
envoy He has his mandate with him I have them boththe man and his
mandate Can you guess what I am going to do with them

It is not difficult she replied Your methods are scarcely original
His mandate to the flames and his body to the sea

She raised her eyes as she spoke and looked over Mr Fentolins
shoulder across the marshland to the grey stretch of ocean Her eyes
became fixed It was not possible to say that they held any expression
and yet one felt that she saw beneath the grey waves even to the rocks
and caverns below

It does not terrify you then he asked curiously to think that a
man under this roof is about to die

Why should it she retorted Death does not frighten memy own or
anybody elses Does it frighten you

His face was suddenly livid his eyes full of fierce anger His lips
twitched He struck the table before him

Beast of a woman he shouted You ghoul How dare you How dare
you

He stopped short He passed his hand across his forehead All the time
the woman remained unmoved

Do you know he muttered his voice still shaking a little that
I believe sometimes I am afraid of you How would you like to see me
there eh down at the bottom of that hungry sea You watch sometimes
so fixedly Youd miss me wouldnt you I am a good master you know
I pay well Youve been with me a good many years You were a different
sort of woman when you first came

Yes she admitted I was a different sort of woman

You dont remember those days I suppose he went on the days when
you had brown hair when you used to carry roses about and sing to
yourself while you beat your work out of that wretched typewriter

No she answered I do not remember those days They do not belong to
me It is some other woman you are thinking of


Their eyes met Mr Fentolin turned away first He struck the bell at
his elbow She rose at once

Be off he ordered When you look at me like that you send shivers
through me Youll have to go I can see youll have to go I cant keep
you any longer You are the only person on the face of the earth who
dares to say things to me which make me think the only person who
doesnt shrink at the sound of my voice Youll have to go Send Sarson
to me at once Youve upset me

She listened to his words in expressionless silence When he had
finished carrying her book in her hand she very quietly moved towards
the door He watched her leaning a little forward in his chair
his lips parted his eyes threatening She walked with steady even
footsteps She carried herself with almost machinelike erectness her
skirts were noiseless She had the trick of turning the handle of the
door in perfect silence He heard her calm voice in the hall

Doctor Sarson is to go to Mr Fentolin

Mr Fentolin sat quite still feeling his own pulse

That woman he muttered to himself thatwomansome day I shouldnt
be surprised if she really

He paused The doctor had entered the room

I am upset Sarson he declared Come and feel my pulse quickly That
woman has upset me

Miss Price

Miss Price dn it Lucyyes

It seems unlike her the doctor remarked I have never heard her
utter a useless syllable in my life

Mr Fentolin held out his wrist

Its what she doesnt say he muttered

The doctor produced his watch In less than a minute he put it away

This is quite unnecessary he pronounced Your pulse is wonderful

Not hurried No signs of palpitation

You have seven or eight footmen all young men Doctor Sarson replied
drily I will wager that there isnt one of them has a pulse so
vigorous as yours

Mr Fentolin leaned a little back in his chair An expression of
satisfaction crept over his face

You reassure me my dear Sarson That is excellent What of our
patient

There is no change

I am afraid Mr Fentolin sighed that we shall have trouble with
him These strong people always give trouble

It will be just the same in the long run the doctor remarked
shrugging his shoulders

Mr Fentolin held up his finger

Listen A motorcar I believe

It is Miss Fentolin who is just arriving the doctor announced I saw
the car coming as I crossed the hall

Mr Fentolin nodded gently

Indeed he replied Indeed So my dear niece has returned Open the
door friend Sarson Open the door if you please She will be anxious
to see me We must summon her




CHAPTER X

Mr Fentolin raised to his lips the little gold whistle which hung from
his neck and blew it He seemed to devote very little effort to the
operation yet the strength of the note was wonderful As the echoes
died away he let it fall by his side and waited with a pleased smile
upon his lips In a few seconds there was the hurried flutter of skirts
and the sound of footsteps The girl who had just completed her railway
journey entered followed by her brother They were both a little out
of breath they both approached the chair without a smile the girl
in advance with a certain expression of apprehension in her eyes Mr
Fentolin sighed He appeared to notice these things and regret them

My child he said holding out his hands my dear Esther welcome
home again I heard the car outside I am grieved that you did not at
once hurry to my side

I have not been in the house two minutes Esther replied and I
havent seen mother yet Forgive me

She had come to a standstill a few yards away She moved now very slowly
towards the chair with the air of one fulfilling a hateful task The
fingers which accepted his hands were extended almost hesitatingly He
drew her closer to him and held her there

Your mother my dear Esther is I regret to say suffering from a
slight indisposition he remarked She has been confined to her room
for the last few days Just a trifling affair of the nerves nothing
more Doctor Sarson assures me But my dear child he went on your
fingers are as cold as ice You look at me so strangely too Alas you
have not the affectionate disposition of your dear mother One would
scarcely believe that we have been parted for more than a week

For more than a week she repeated under her breath

Stoop down my dear I must kiss your foreheadthere Now bring up a
chair to my side You seem frightenedalarmed Have you ill news for
me

I have no news she answered gradually recovering herself

The gaieties of London I fear he protested gently have proved a
little unsettling

There were no gaieties for me the girl replied bitterly Mrs
Sargent obeyed your orders very faithfully I was not allowed to move
out except with her

My dear child you would not go about London unchaperoned

There is a difference she retorted between a chaperon and a
jailer

Mr Fentolin sighed He shook his head slowly He seemed pained

I am not sure that you repay my care as it deserves Esther he
declared There is something in your deportment which disappoints me
Never mind your brother has made some atonement I entrusted him with
a little mission in which I am glad to say that he has been brilliantly
successful

I cannot say that I am glad to hear it Esther replied quietly

Mr Fentolin sat back in his chair His long fingers played nervously
together he looked at her gravely

My dear child he exclaimed in a tone of pained surprise your
attitude distresses me

I cannot help it I have told you what I think about Gerald and the
life he is compelled to live here I dont mind so much for myself but
for him I think it is abominable

The same as ever Mr Fentolin sighed I fear that this little change
has done you no good dear niece

Change she echoed It was only a change of prisons

Mr Fentolin shook his head slowlya distressful gesture Yet all the
time he had somehow the air of a man secretly gratified

You are beginning to depress me he announced I think that you can
go away No stop for just one moment Stand there in the light Dear
me how unfortunate Who would have thought that so beautiful a mother
could have so plain a daughter

She stood quite still before him her hands crossed in front of her
something of the look of the nun from whom the power of suffering has
gone in her still cold face and steadfast eyes

Not a touch of colour he continued meditatively a figure straight
as my walkingstick What a pity And all the taste nowadays they tell
me is in the other direction The lank damsels have gone completely
out We buried them with Oscar Wilde Run along my dear child You do
not amuse me You can take Gerald with you if you will I have nothing
to say to Gerald just now He is in my good books Is there anything
I can do for you Gerald Your allowance for instancea trifling
increase or an advance I am in a generous humour

Then grant me what I begged for the other day the boy answered
quickly Let me go to Sandhurst I could enter my name next week for
the examinations and I could pass tomorrow

Mr Fentolin tapped the table thoughtfully with his forefinger

A little ungrateful my dear boy he declared a little ungrateful
that I think Your confidence in yourself pleases me though You think
you could pass your examinations

I did a set of papers last week the boy replied On the given
percentages I came out twelfth or better Mr Brown assured me that I
could go in for them at any moment He promised to write you about it
before he left

Mr Fentolin nodded gently

Now I come to think of it I did have a letter from Mr Brown he
remarked Rather an impertinence for a tutor I thought it He devoted
three pages towards impressing upon me the necessity of your adopting
some sort of a career

He wrote because he thought it was his duty the boy said doggedly

So you want to be a soldier Mr Fentolin continued musingly Well
well why not Our picture galleries are full of them There has been a
Fentolin in every great battle for the last five hundred years Sailors
tooplenty of themand just a few diplomatists Brave fellows Not
one I fancy he added like menot one condemned to pass their days
in a perambulator You are a fine fellow Geralda regular Fentolin
Getting on for six feet arent you

Six feet two sir

A very fine fellow Mr Fentolin repeated I am not so sure about the
army Gerald You see there are some people who say like your American
friend that we are even now almost on the brink of war

All the more reason for me to hurry the boy begged

Mr Fentolin closed his eyes

Dont he insisted Have you ever stopped to think what war
meansthe war you speak of so lightly The suffering the misery of
it All the pageantry and music and heroism in front and behind a
blackened world a trail of writhing corpses a world of weeping women
for whom the sun shall never rise again Ugh An ugly thing war Gerald
I am not sure that you are not better at home here Why not practise
golf a little more assiduously I see from the local paper that you are
still playing at two handicap Now with your physique I should have
thought you would have been a scratch player long before now

I play cricket sir the boy reminded him a little impatiently and
after all there are other things in the world besides games

Mr Fentolins long finger shot suddenly out He was leaning a little
from his chair His expression of gentle immobility had passed away His
face was stern almost stony

You have spoken the truth Gerald he said There are other things in
the world besides games There is the real the tragical side of
life the duties one takes up the obligations of honour You have not
forgotten young man the burden you carry

The boy was paler but he had drawn himself to his full height

I have not forgotten sir he answered bitterly Do I show any signs
of forgetting Havent I done your bidding year by year Arent I here
now to do it

Then do it Mr Fentolin retorted sharply When I am ready for you
to leave here you shall leave Until then you are mine Remember that
Ah this is Doctor Sarson who comes I believe That must mean that it
is five oclock Come in Doctor I am not engaged You see I am alone
with my dear niece and nephew We have been having a little pleasant
conversation

Doctor Sarson bowed to Esther who scarcely glanced at him He remained
in the background quietly waiting

A very delightful little conversation Mr Fentolin concluded I have
been congratulating my nephew Doctor upon his wisdom in preferring the
quiet country life down here to the wearisome routine of a profession
He escapes the embarrassing choice of a career by preferring to
devote his life to my comfort I shall not forget it I shall not be
ungrateful I may have my faults but I am not ungrateful Run away
now both of you Dear children you are but one wearies you know of
everything I am going out You see the twilight is coming The tide is
changing I am going down to meet the sea

His little carriage moved towards the door The brother and sister
passed out Esther led Gerald into the great diningroom and from
there through the open windows out on to the terrace She gripped his
shoulder and pointed down to the Tower

Something she whispered in his ear is going to happen there




CHAPTER XI

The little station at which Hamel alighted was like an oasis in the
middle of a flat stretch of sand and marsh It consisted only of a few
raised planks and a rude shelterbuilt indeed for the convenience of
St Davids Hall alone for the nearest village was two miles away The
stationmaster on his return from escorting the young lady to her car
stared at this other passenger in some surprise

Which way to the sea Hamel asked

The man pointed to the white gates of the crossing

You can take any of those paths you like sir he said If you
want to get to Salthouse though you should have got out at the next
station

This will do for me Hamel replied cheerfully

Be careful of the dikes the stationmaster advised him Some of them
are pretty deep

Hamel nodded and passing through the white gates made his way by a
raised cattle track towards the sea On either side of him flowed a
narrow dike filled with saltwater Beyond stretched the flat marshland
its mossy turf leavened with cracks and creeks of all widths filled
also with seaslime and seawater A slight grey mist rested upon the
more distant parts of the wilderness which he was crossing a mist which
seemed to be blown in from the sea in little puffs resting for a time
upon the earth and then drifting up and fading away like soap bubbles

More than once where the dikes had overflown he was compelled to change
his course but he arrived at last at the little ridge of pebbled beach
bordering the sea Straight ahead of him now was that strangelooking
building towards which he had all the time been directing his footsteps
As he approached it his forehead slightly contracted There was ample
confirmation before him of the truth of his fellowpassengers words
The place left to itself for so many years without any attention from
its actual owner was neither deserted nor in ruins Its solid grey
stone walls were seastained and a trifle worn but the arched wooden
doors leading into the lifeboat shelter which occupied one side of the
building had been newly painted and in the front the window was hung
with a curtain now closely drawn of some dark red material The lock
from the door had been removed altogether and in its place was the
aperture for a Yale latchkey The last note of modernity was supplied
by the telephone wire attached to the roof of the lifeboat shelter He
walked all round the building seeking in vain for some other means
of ingress Then he stood for a few moments in front of the curtained
window He was a man of somewhat determined disposition and he found
himself vaguely irritated by the liberties which had been taken with his
property He hammered gently upon the framework with his fist and the
windows opened readily inwards pushing back the curtain with them
He drew himself up on to the sill and squeezing himself through the
opening landed on his feet and looked around him a little breathless

He found himself in a simply furnished mans sittingroom An easel
was standing close to the window There were reams of drawing paper and
several unfinished sketches leaning against the wall There was a small
oak table in the middle of the room against the wall stood an exquisite
chiffonier on which were resting some cutglass decanters and goblets
There was a Turkey carpet upon the floor which matched the curtains but
to his surprise there was not a single chair of any sort to be seen
The walls had been distempered and were hung with one or two engravings
which although he was no judge he was quite sure were good He
wandered into the back room where he found a stove a teaservice upon
a deal table and several other cooking utensils all spotlessly clean
and of the most expensive description The walls here were plainly
whitewashed and the floor was of hard stone He then tried the door on
the left which led into the larger portion of the buildingthe shed in
which the lifeboat had once been kept Not only was the door locked but
he saw at once that the lock was modern and the door itself was secured
with heavy iron clamps He returned to the sittingroom

The girl with the grey eyes was right enough he remarked to himself
Mr Fentolin has been making himself very much at home with my
property

He withdrew the curtains noticing to his surprise the heavy shutters
which their folds had partly concealed Then he made his way out along
the passage to the front door which from the inside he was able to open
easily enough Leaving it carefully ajar he went out with the intention
of making an examination of the outside of the place Instead however
he paused at the corner of the building with his face turned landwards
Exactly fronting him now about threequarters of a mile away on the
summit of that strange hill which stood out like a gigantic rock in
the wilderness was St Davids Hall He looked at it steadily and with
increasing admiration Its long red brick front with its masses of
clustering chimneys a little bare and weatherbeaten impressed him
with a sense of dignity due as much to the purity of its architecture
as the singularity of its situation Behinda wonderfully effective
backgroundwere the steep gardens from which even in this uncertain
light he caught faint glimpses of colouring subdued from brilliancy by
the twilight These were encircled by a brick wall of great height the
whole of the southern portion of which was enclosed with glass From the
fragment of rock upon which he had seated himself to the raised
stone terrace in front of the house was an absolutely straight path
beautifully kept like an avenue with white posts on either side and
built up to a considerable height above the broad tidal way which ran
for some distance by its side It had almost the appearance of a racing
track and its state of preservation in the midst of the wilderness was
little short of remarkable

This Hamel said to himself as he slowly produced a pipe from his
pocket and began to fill it with tobacco from a battered silver box is
a queer fix Looks rather like the inn for me

And who might you be gentleman

He turned abruptly around towards his unseen questioner A woman was
standing by the side of the rock upon which he was sitting a woman from
the village apparently who must have come with noiseless footsteps
along the sandy way She was dressed in rusty black and in place of a
hat she wore a black woolen scarf tied around her head and underneath
her chin Her face was lined her hair of a deep brown plentifully
besprinkled with grey She had a curious habit of moving her lips even
when she was not speaking She stood there smiling at him but there was
something about that smile and about her look which puzzled him

I am just a visitor he replied Who are you

She shook her head

I saw you come out of the Tower she said speaking with a strong
local accent and yet with a certain unusual correctness in at the
window and out of the door Youre a brave man

Why brave he asked

She turned her head very slowly towards St Davids Hall A gleam of
sunshine had caught one of the windows which shone like fire She
pointed toward it with her head

Hes looking at you she muttered He dont like strangers poking
around here that I can tell you

And who is he Hamel enquired

Squire Fentolin she answered dropping her voice a little Hes
a very kindhearted gentleman Squire Fentolin but he dont like
strangers hanging around

Well I am not exactly a stranger you see Hamel remarked My father
used to stay for months at a time in that little shanty there and paint
pictures Its a good many years ago

I mind him the woman said slowly His name was Hamel

I am his son Hamel announced

She pointed to the Hall Does he know that you are here

Hamel shook his head Not yet I have been abroad for so long

She suddenly relapsed into her curious habit Her lips moved but no
words came She had turned her head a little and was facing the sea

Tell me Hamel asked gently why do you come out here alone so far
from the village

She pointed with her finger to where the waves were breaking in a thin
line of white about fifty yards from the beach

Its the cemetery that she said the village cemetery you know I
have three buried there George the eldest James the middle one
and David the youngest Three of themthats why I come I cant put
flowers on their graves but I can sit and watch and look through the
sea down among the rocks where their bodies are and wonder

Hamel looked at her curiously Her voice had grown lower and lower

Its what you land folks dont believe perhaps she went on but
its true Its only us who live near the sea who understand it I am
not an ignorant body either I was schoolmistress here before I married
David Cox They thought Id done wrong to marry a fisherman but I bore
him brave sons and I lived the life a woman craves for No I am not
ignorant I have fancies perhapsthe Lord be praised for themand I
tell you its true You look at a spot in the sea and you see nothinga
gleam of blue a fleck of white foam one day a gleam of green with a
black line another and a grey little sob the next perhaps But you
go on looking You look day by day and hour by hour and the chasms of
the sea will open and their voices will come to you Listen

She clutched his arm

Couldnt you hear that she half whispered

The light It was Davids voice The light Hamel was speechless
The womans face was suddenly strangely transformed Her mood however
swiftly changed She turned once more towards the hall

Youll know him soon she went on the kindest man in these parts
they say Its not much that he gives away but hes a kind heart You
see that great post at the entrance to the river there she went
on pointing to it He had that set up and a lamp hung from there
Fentolins light they call it It was to save mens lives It was
burning they say the night I lost my lads Fentolins light

They were wrecked he asked her gently

Wrecked she answered Bad steering it must have been James would
steer and they say that he drank a bit Bad steering Yes youll meet
Squire Fentolin before long Hes queer to look ata small body but a
great kind heart A miserable life his but it will be made up to him
It will be made up to him

She turned away Her lips were moving all the time She walked about a
dozen steps and then she returned

Youre Hamels son the painter she said Youll be welcome down
here Hell have you to stay at the Halla brave place Dont let him
be too kind to you Sometimes kindness hurts

She passed on walking with a curious shambling gait and soon she
disappeared on her way to the village Hamel watched her for a moment
and then turned his head towards St Davids Hall He felt somehow that
her abrupt departure was due to something which she had seen in that
direction He rose to his feet His instinct had been a true one



CHAPTER XII

From where Hamel stood a queer object came strangely into sight Below
the terrace of St Davids Hallfrom a spot in fact at the base of
the solid wallit seemed as though a gate had been opened and there
came towards him what he at first took to be a tricycle As it came
nearer it presented even a weirder appearance Mr Fentolin in a black
cape and black skull cap sat a little forward in his electric carriage
with his hand upon the guiding lever His head came scarcely above
the back of the little vehicle his hands and body were motionless
He seemed to be progressing without the slightest effort personal or
mechanical as though he rode in deed in some ghostly vehicle From
the same place in the wall had issued a moment or two later a man upon
a bicycle who was also coming towards him Hamel was scarcely conscious
of this secondary figure His eyes were fixed upon the strange personage
now rapidly approaching him There was something which seemed scarcely
human in that shrunken fragment of body the pale face with its waving
white hair the strange expression with which he was being regarded The
little vehicle came to a standstill only a few feet away Mr Fentolin
leaned forward His features had lost their delicately benevolent
aspect his words were minatory

I am under the impression sir he said that I saw you with my
glasses from the window attempting to force an entrance into that
building

Hamel nodded

I not only tried but I succeeded he remarked I got in through the
window

Mr Fentolins eyes glittered for a moment Hamel who had resumed his
place upon the rock close at hand had been mixed up during his lifetime
in many wild escapades Yet at that moment he had a sudden feeling that
there were dangers in life which as yet he had not faced

May I ask for your explanation or your excuse

You can call it an explanation or an excuse whichever you like Hamel
replied steadily but the fact is that this little building which
some one else seems to have appropriated is mine If I had not been
a goodnatured person I should be engaged at the present moment in
turning out its furniture on to the beach

What is your name Mr Fentolin asked suddenly

My name is HamelRichard Hamel

For several moments there was silence Mr Fentolin was still leaning
forward in his strange little vehicle The colour seemed to have left
even his lips The hard glitter in his eyes had given place to an
expression almost like fear He looked at Richard Hamel as though he
were some strange seamonster come up from underneath the sands

Richard Hamel he repeated Do you mean that you are the son of
Hamel the RA who used to be in these parts so often He was my
brothers friend

I am his son

But his son was killed in the San Francisco earthquake I saw his name
in all the lists It was copied into the local papers here

Hamel knocked the ashes from his pipe

I take a lot of killing he observed I was in that earthquake right
enough and in the hospital afterwards but it was a man named Hamel of
Philadelphia who died

Mr Fentolin sat quite motionless for several moments He seemed if
possible to have shrunken into something smaller still A few yards
behind Meekins had alighted from his bicycle and was standing waiting

So you are Richard Hamel Mr Fentolin said at last very softly
Welcome back to England Richard Hamel I knew your father slightly
although we were never very friendly

He stretched out his hand from underneath the coverlet of his little
vehiclea hand with long white fingers slim and white and shapely
as a womans A single ring with a dull green stone was on his fourth
finger Hamel shook hands with him as he would have shaken hands with
a woman Afterwards he rubbed his fingers slowly together There was
something about the touch which worried him

You have been making use of this little shanty havent you he asked
bluntly

Mr Fentolin nodded He was apparently beginning to recover himself

You must remember he explained suavely that it was built by my
grandfather and that we have had rights over the whole of the foreshore
here from time immemorial I know quite well that my brother gave it to
your fatheror rather he sold it to him for a nominal sum I must tell
you that it was a most complicated transaction He had the greatest
difficulty in getting any lawyer to draft the deed of sale There were
so many ancient rights and privileges which it was impossible to
deal with Even now there are grave doubts as to the validity of the
transaction When nothing was heard of you and we all concluded that
you were dead I ventured to take back what I honestly believed to be
my own Owing he continued slowly to my unfortunate affliction I
am obliged to depend for interest in my life upon various hobbies This
little place queerly enough has become one of them I have furnished
it in a way installed the telephone to the house connected it with my
electric plant and I come down here when I want to be quite alone and
paint I watch the seasuch a sea sometimes such storms such colour
You notice that ridge of sand out yonder It forms a sort of natural
breakwater Even on the calmest day you can trace that white line of
foam

It is a strange coast Hamel admitted

Mr Fentolin pointed with his forefinger northwards

Somewhere about there he indicated is the entrance to the tidal
river which flows up to the village of St Davids yonder You see

His finger traced its course until it came to a certain point near the
beach where a tall black pillar stood surmounted by a globe

I have had a light fixed there for the benefit of the fishermen he
said a light which I work from my own dynamo Between where we are
sitting now and thereonly a little way out to seais a jagged
cluster of cruel rocks You can see them if you care to swim out in
calm weather Fishermen who tried to come in by night were often trapped
there and in a rough sea drowned That is why I had that pillar of
light built On stormy nights it shows the exact entrance to the water
causeway

Very kind of you indeed Hamel remarked very benevolent

Mr Fentolin sighed

So few people have any real feeling for sailors he continued The
fishermen around here are certainly rather a casual class Do you know
that there is scarcely one of them who can swim There isnt one of them
who isnt too lazy to learn even the simplest stroke My brother used to
saydear Geraldthat it served them right if they were drowned I have
never been able to feel like that Mr Hamel Life is such a wonderful
thing One night he went on dropping his voice and leaning a little
forward in his carriageit was just before or was it just after I
had fixed that lightI was down here one dark winter night There was a
great north wind and a huge sea running It was as black as pitch but I
heard a boat making for St Davids causeway strike on those rocks
just hidden in front there I heard those fishermen shriek as they went
under I heard their shouts for help I heard their death cries Very
terrible Mr Hamel Very terrible

Hamel looked at the speaker curiously Mr Fentolin seemed absorbed in
his subject He had spoken with relish as one who loves the things he
speaks about Quite unaccountably Hamel found himself shivering

It was their mother Mr Fentolin continued leaning again a little
forward in his chair their mother whom I saw pass along the beach just
nowa widow too poor thing She comes here oftena morbid taste She
spoke to you I think

She spoke to me strangely Hamel admitted She gave me the impression
of a woman whose brain had been turned with grief

Too true Mr Fentolin sighed The poor creature I offered her a
small pension but she would have none of it A superior woman in her
way once filled now with queer fancies he went on eyeing Hamel
steadilythe very strangest fancies She spends her life prowling
about here No one in the village even knows how she lives Did she
speak of me bytheby

She spoke of you as being a very kindhearted man

Mr Fentolin sighed

The poor creature Well well let us revert to the object of your
coming here Do you really wish to occupy this little shanty Mr
Hamel

That was my idea Hamel confessed I only came back from Mexico last
month and I very soon got fed up with life in town I am going abroad
again next year Till then I am rather at a loose end My father was
always very keen indeed about this place and very anxious that I should
come and stay here for a little time so I made up my mind to run down
Ive got some things waiting at Norwich I thought I might hire a woman
to look after me and spend a few weeks here They tell me that the early
spring is almost the best time for this coast

Mr Fentolin nodded slowly He moistened his lips for a moment One
might have imagined that he was anxious

Mr Hamel he said softly you are quite right It is the best time
to visit this coast But why make a hermit of yourself You are a family
friend Come and stay with us at the Hall for as long as you like
It will give me the utmost pleasure to welcome you there he went on
earnestly and as for this little place of what use is it to you Let
me buy it from you You are a man of the world I can see You may be
rich yet money has a definite value To me it has none That little
place as it stands is probably worthsay a hundred pounds Your
father gave if I remember rightly a five pound note for it I will
give you a thousand for it sooner than be disturbed

Hamel frowned slightly

I could not possibly think he said of selling what was practically
a gift to my father You are welcome to occupy the place during my
absence in any way you wish On the other hand I do not think that I
care to part with it altogether and I should really like to spend
just a day or so here I am used to roughing it under all sorts of
conditionsmuch more used to roughing it than I am to staying at
country houses

Mr Fentolin leaned a little out of his carriage He reached the younger
mans shoulder with his hand

Ah Mr Hamel he pleaded dont make up your mind too suddenly Am I
a little spoilt I wonder Well you see what sort of a creature I am I
have to go through life as best I may and people are kind to me It is
very seldom I am crossed It is quite astonishing how often people let
me have my own way Do not make up your mind too suddenly I have a
niece and a nephew whom you must meet There are some treasures too at
St Davids Hall Look at it There isnt another house quite like it in
England It is worth looking over

It is most impressive Hamel agreed and wonderfully beautiful It
seems odd he added with a laugh that you should care about this
little shanty here with all the beautiful rooms you must have of your
own

Its Naboths vineyard Mr Fentolin groaned Now Mr Hamel you
are going to be gracious arent you Let us leave the question of your
little habitation here alone for the present Come back with me My
niece shall give you some tea and you shall choose your room from
forty You can sleep in a haunted chamber or a historical chamber in
Queen Elizabeths room a Victorian chamber or a Louis Quinze room All
my people have spent their substance in furniture Dont look at your
bag Clothes are unnecessary I can supply you with everything Or if
you prefer it I can send a fast car into Norwich for your own things
Come and be my guest please

Hamel hesitated He had not the slightest desire to go to St Davids
Hall and though he strove to ignore it he was conscious of an aversion
of which he was heartily ashamed for this strange fragment of humanity
On the other hand his mission the actual mission which had brought him
down to these parts could certainly best be served by an entree into
the Hall itselfand there was the girl whom he felt sure belonged
there He had never for a moment been able to dismiss her from his
thoughts Her still cold face the delicate perfection of her clothes
and figure the grey eyes which had rested upon his so curiously
haunted him He was desperately anxious to see her again If he refused
this invitation if he rejected Mr Fentolins proffered friendship it
would be all the more difficult

You are really very kind he began hesitatingly

It is settled Mr Fentolin interrupted settled Meekins you can
ride back again I shall not paint today Mr Hamel you will walk by
my side will you not I can run my little machine quite slowly You
see I have an electric battery It needs charging often but I have
a dynamo of my own You never saw a vehicle like this in all your
travellings did you

Hamel shook his head

An electrical bathchair Mr Fentolin continued Practice has made
me remarkably skilful in its manipulation You see I can steer to an
inch

He was already turning around Hamel rose to his feet

You are really very kind he said I should like to come up and see
the Hall at any rate but in the meantime as we are here could I just
look over the inside of this little place I found the large shed where
the lifeboat used to be kept locked up

Mr Fentolin was manoeuvring his carriage His back was towards Hamel

By all means he declared We will go in together I have had the
entrance widened so that I can ride straight into the sittingroom But
wait

He paused suddenly He felt in all his pockets

Dear me he exclaimed I find that I have left the keys We will
come down a little later if you do not mind Mr Hamel Or tomorrow
perhaps You will not mind It is very careless of me but seeing you
about the place and imagining that you were an intruder made me angry
and I started off in a hurry Now walk by my side up to the house
please and talk to me It is so interesting for me to meet men he
went on as they started along the straight path who do things in
life who go to foreign countries meet strange people and have new
experiences I have been a good many years like this you know

It is a great affliction Hamel murmured sympathetically

In my youth I was an athlete Mr Fentolin continued I played
cricket for the Varsity and for my county I hunted too and shot I
did all the things a man loves to do I might still shoot they tell me
but my strength has ebbed away I am too weak to lift a gun too weak
even to handle a fishingrod I have just a few hobbies in life which
keep me alive Are you a politician Mr Hamel

Not in the least Hamel replied I have been out of England too long
to keep in touch with politics

Naturally Mr Fentolin agreed It amuses me to follow the course of
events I have a good many friends in London and abroad who are kind to
me who keep me informed send me odd bits of information not available
for every one and it amuses me to put these things together in my mind
and to try and play the prophet I was in the Foreign Office once
you know I take up my paper every morning and it is one of my chief
interests to see how near my own speculations come to the truth Just
now for example there are strange things doing on the Continent

In America Hamel remarked they affect to look upon England as a
doomed Power

Not altogether supine yet Mr Fentolin observed yet even this
last generation has seen weakening We have lost so much selfreliance
Perhaps it is having these grownup children who we think can take care
of usCanada and Australia and the others However we will not talk
of politics It bores you I can see We will try and find some other
subject Now tell me dont you think this is ingenious

They had reached the foot of the hill upon which the Hall was situated
In front of them underneath the terrace was a little iron gate held
open now by Meekins who had gone on ahead and dismounted from his
bicycle

I have a subterranean way from here into the Hall Mr Fentolin
explained Come with me You will only have to stoop a little and it
may amuse you You need not be afraid There are electric lights every
ten yards I turn them on with this switchsee

Mr Fentolin touched a button in the wall and the place was at once
brilliantly illuminated A little row of lights from the ceiling and the
walls stretched away as far as one could see They passed through the
iron gates which shut behind them with a click Stooping a little
Hamel was still able to walk by the side of the man in the chair They
traversed about a hundred yards of subterranean way Here and there a
fungus hung down from the wall otherwise it was beautifully kept and
dry By and by with a little turn they came to an incline and another
iron gate held open for them by a footman Mr Fentolin sped up the
last few feet into the great hall which seemed more imposing than ever
by reason of this unexpected entrance Hamel blinking a little stepped
to his side

Welcome Mr Fentolin cried gaily Welcome my friend Mr Hamel to
St Davids Hall




CHAPTER XIII

During the next halfhour Hamel was introduced to luxuries to which
in a general way he was entirely unaccustomed One manservant was
busy preparing his bath in a room leading out of his sleeping apartment
while another brought him a choice of evening clothes and superintended
his disrobing Hamel always observant studied his surroundings
with keen interest He found himself in a queerly mixed atmosphere of
luxurious modernity and stately antiquity His fourposter the huge
couch at the foot of his bed and all the furniture about the room
was of the Queen Anne period The bathroom which communicated with his
apartment was the latest triumph of the plumbers arta room with floor
and walls of white tiles the bath itself a little sunken and twice the
ordinary size He dispensed so far as he could with the services of the
men and descended as soon as he was dressed into the hall Meekins was
waiting at the bottom of the stairs dressed now in somber black

Mr Fentolin will be glad if you will step into his room sir he
announced leading the way

Mr Fentolin was seated in his chair reading the Times in a corner of
his library Shaped blocks had been placed behind and in front of
the wheels of his little vehicle to prevent it from moving A shaded
readinglamp stood on the table by his side He did not at once look
up and Hamel glanced around with genuine admiration The shelves which
lined the walls and the winged cases which protruded into the room were
filled with books There was a large oak table with beautifully carved
legs piled with all sorts of modern reviews and magazines A log fire
was burning in the big oaken grate The perfume from a great bowl of
lavender seemed to mingle curiously yet pleasantly with the half musty
odour of the old leatherbound volumes The massive chimneypiece was of
black oak and above it were carved the arms of the House of Fentolin
The walls were oakpanelled to the ceiling

Refreshed I hope by your bath and change my dear visitor the head
of the house remarked as he laid down his paper Draw a chair up here
and join me in a glass of vermouth You need not be afraid of it It
comes to me from the maker as a special favour

Hamel accepted a quaintlycut wineglass full of the amber liquid Mr
Fentolin sipped his with the air of a connoisseur

This he continued is one of our informal days There is no one in
the house save my sisterinlaw niece and nephew and a poor
invalid gentleman who I am sorry to say is confined to his bed My
sisterinlaw is also I regret to say indisposed She desired me to
present her excuses to you and say how greatly she is looking forward to
making your acquaintance during the next few days

Hamel bowed

It is very kind of Mrs Fentolin he murmured

On these occasions Mr Fentolin continued we do not make use of a
drawingroom My niece will come in here presently You are looking at
my books I see Are you by any chance a bibliophile I have a case of
manuscripts here which might interest you

Hamel shook his head

Only in the abstract I fear he answered I have scarcely opened a
serious book since I was at Oxford

What was your year Mr Fentolin asked

Fourteen years ago I left Magdalen Hamel replied I had made up
my mind to be an engineer and I went over to the Boston Institute of
Technology

Mr Fentolin nodded appreciatively

A magnificent profession he murmured A healthy one too I should
judge from your appearance You are a strong man Mr Hamel

I have had reason to be Hamel rejoined During nearly the whole
of the time I have been abroad I have been practically pioneering
Building railways in the far West with gangs of Chinese and Italians
and Hungarians and scarcely a foreman who isnt terrified of his job
isnt exactly drawingroom work

You are going back there Mr Fentolin asked with interest

Hamel shook his head

I have no plans he declared I have been fortunate enough or shall
I some day say unfortunate enough I wonder to have inherited a large
legacy

Mr Fentolin smiled

Dont ever doubt your good fortune he said earnestly The longer I
liveand in my limited way I do see a good deal of lifethe more
I appreciate the fact that there isnt anything in this world that
compares with the power of money I distrust a poor man He may mean to
be honest but he is at all times subject to temptation Ah here is my
niece

Mr Fentolin turned towards the door Hamel rose at once to his feet
His surmise then had been correct She was coming towards them very
quietly In her soft grey dinnergown her brown hair smoothly brushed
back a pearl necklace around her long delicate neck she seemed to him
a very exquisite embodiment of those memories which he had been carrying
about throughout the afternoon

Here Mr Hamel his host said is a member of my family who has
been a deserter for a short time This is Mr Richard Hamel Esther my
niece Miss Esther Fentolin

She held out her hand with the faintest possible smile which might have
been of greeting or recognition

I travelled for some distance in the train with Mr Hamel this
afternoon I think she remarked

Indeed Mr Fentolin exclaimed Dear me that is very
interestingvery interesting indeed Mr Hamel I am sure did not
tell you of his destination

He watched them keenly Hamel though he scarcely understood was quick
to appreciate the possible significance of that tentative question

We did not exchange confidences he observed Miss Fentolin only
changed into my carriage during the last few minutes of her journey
Besides he continued to tell you the truth my ideas as to my
destination were a little hazy To come and look for some queer sort of
building by the side of the sea which has been unoccupied for a dozen
years or so scarcely seems a reasonable quest does it

Scarcely indeed Mr Fentolin assented You may thank me Mr Hamel
for the fact that the place is not in ruins My blatant trespassing has
saved you from that at least After dinner we must talk further about
the Tower To tell you the truth I have grown accustomed to the use of
the little place

The sound of the dinner gong boomed through the house A moment later
Gerald entered followed by a butler announcing dinner

The only remaining member of my family Mr Fentolin remarked
indicating his nephew Gerald you will be pleased I know to meet
Mr Hamel Mr Hamel has been a great traveller Long before you can
remember his father used to paint wonderful pictures of this coast

Gerald shook hands with his visitor His face for a moment lighted up
He was looking pale though and singularly sullen and dejected

There are two of your fathers pictures in the modern side of the
gallery upstairs he remarked a little diffidently They are great
favourites with everybody here

They all went in to dinner together Meekins who had appeared silently
had glided unnoticed behind his masters chair and wheeled it across the
hall

A partie carree tonight Mr Fentolin declared I have a resident
doctor here a very delightful person who often dines with us but
tonight I thought not Five is an awkward number I want to get to know
you better Mr Hamel and quickly I want you too to make friends
with my niece and nephew Mr Hamels father he went on addressing
the two latter and your father were great friends Bytheby have
I told you both exactly why Mr Hamel is a guest here tonightwhy he
came to these parts at all No Listen then He came to take possession
of the Tower The worst of it is that it belongs to him too His father
bought it from your father more years ago than we should care to talk
about I have really been a trespasser all this time

They took their places at a small round table in the middle of the
diningroom The shaded lights thrown downwards upon the table seemed
to leave most of the rest of the apartment in semidarkness The gloomy
faces of the men and women whose pictures hung upon the walls were
almost invisible The servants themselves standing a little outside the
halo of light were like shadows passing swiftly and noiselessly back
and forth At the far end of the room was an organ and to the left a
little balcony built out as though for an orchestra Hamel looked about
him almost in wonderment There was something curiously impressive in
the size of the apartment and its emptiness

A trespasser Mr Fentolin continued as he took up the menu and
criticised it through his hornrimmed eyeglass that is what I have
been without a doubt

But for your interest and consequent trespass Hamel remarked I
should probably have found the roof off and the whole place in ruins

Instead of which you found the door locked against you Mr Fentolin
pointed out Well we shall see I might at any rate have lost the
opportunity of entertaining you here this evening I am particularly
glad to have an opportunity of making you known to my niece and nephew
I think you will agree with me that here are two young people who are
highly to be commended I cannot offer them a cheerful life here There
is little society no gaiety no sort of excitement Yet they never
leave me They seem to have no other interest in life but to be always
at my beck and call A case Mr Hamel of really touching devotion If
anything could reconcile me to my miserable condition it would be the
kindness and consideration of those by whom I am surrounded

Hamel murmured a few words of cordial agreement Yet he found himself
in a sense embarrassed Gerald was looking down upon his plate and
his face was hidden Esthers features had suddenly become stony and
expressionless Hamel felt instinctively that something was wrong

There are compensations Mr Fentolin continued with the air of one
enjoying speech which find their way into even the gloomiest of lives
As I lie on my back hour after hour I feel all the more conscious
of this The world is a school of compensations Mr Hamel The
intereststhe mental interests I meanof unfortunate people like
myself come to possess in time a peculiar significance and to yield
a peculiar pleasure I have hobbies Mr Hamel I frankly admit it
Without my hobbies I shudder to think what might become of me I might
become a selfish cruel misanthropical person Hobbies are indeed a
great thing

The brother and sister sat still in stony silence Hamel looking across
the little table with its glittering load of cut glass and silver and
scarlet flowers caught something in Esthers eyes so rarely expressive
of any emotion whatever which puzzled him He looked swiftly back at
his host Mr Fentolins face at that moment was like a beautiful
cameo His expression was one of gentle benevolence

Let me be quite frank with you Mr Fentolin murmured My occupation
of the Tower is one of these hobbies I love to sit there within a few
yards of the sea and watch the tide come in I catch something of the
spirit I think which caught your father Mr Hamel and kept him a
prisoner here In my small way I too paint while I am down there
paint and dream These things may not appeal to you but you must
remember that there are few things left to me in life and that those
therefore which I can make use of are dear to me Gerald you are
silent tonight How is it that you say nothing

I am tired sir the boy answered quietly

Mr Fentolin nodded gravely

It is inexcusable of me he declared smoothly to have forgotten even
for a moment My nephew Mr Hamel he went on had quite an exciting
experience last nightor rather a series of experiences He was first
of all in a railway accident and then for the sake of a poor fellow
who was with him and who was badly hurt he motored back here in the
grey hours of the morning and ran they tell me considerable risk
of being drowned on the marshes A very wonderful and praiseworthy
adventure I consider it I trust that our friend upstairs when he
recovers will be properly grateful

Gerald rose to his feet precipitately The service of dinner was almost
concluded and he muttered something which sounded like an excuse Mr
Fentolin however stretched out his hand and motioned him to resume his
seat

My dear Gerald he exclaimed reprovingly You would leave us so
abruptly Before your sister too What will Mr Hamel think of our
country ways Pray resume your seat

For a moment the boy stood quite still then he slowly subsided into
his chair Mr Fentolin passed around a decanter of wine which had been
placed upon the table by the butler The servants had now left the room

You must excuse my nephew if you please Mr Hamel he begged
Gerald has a boys curious aversion to praise in any form I am looking
forward to hearing your verdict upon my port The collection of wine and
pictures was a hobby of my grandfathers for which we his descendants
can never be sufficiently grateful

Hamel praised his wine as indeed he had every reason to but for a
few moments the smooth conversation of his host fell upon deaf ears He
looked from the boys face pale and wrinkled as though with some sort
of suppressed pain to the girls still stony expression This was
indeed a house of mysteries There was something here incomprehensible
some thing about the relations of these three and their knowledge of one
another utterly baffling It was the queerest household surely into
which any stranger had ever been precipitated

The planting of trees and the laying down of port are two virtues in
our ancestors which have never been properly appreciated Mr Fentolin
continued Let us at any rate free ourselves from the reproach of
ingratitude so far as regards my grandfatherGerald Fentolinto whom I
believe we are indebted for this wine We will drink

Mr Fentolin broke off in the middle of his sentence The august calm of
the great house had been suddenly broken From upstairs came the tumult
of raised voices the slamming of a door the falling of something
heavy upon the floor Mr Fentolin listened with a grim change in his
expression His smile had departed his lower lip was thrust out his
eyebrows met He raised the little whistle which hung from his chain At
that moment however the door was opened Doctor Sarson appeared

I am sorry to disturb you Mr Fentolin he said but our patient is
becoming a little difficult The concussion has left him as I feared it
might in a state of nervous excitability He insists upon an interview
with you

Mr Fentolin backed his little chair from the table The doctor came
over and laid his hand upon the handle

You will I am sure excuse me for a few moments Mr Hamel his host
begged My niece and nephew will do their best to entertain you Now
Sarson I am ready

Mr Fentolin glided across the dim empty spaces of the splendid
apartment followed by the doctor a ghostly little procession it
seemed The door was closed behind them For a few moments a curious
silence ensued Gerald remained tense and apparently suffering from
some sort of suppressed emotion Esther for the first time moved in her
place She leaned towards Hamel Her lips were slowly parted her
eyes sought the door as though in terror Her voice although save for
themselves there was no one else in the whole of that great apartment
had sunk to the lowest of whispers

Are you a brave man Mr Hamel she asked

He was staggered but he answered her promptly

I believe so

Dont give up the Towerjust yet That is whathe has brought you
here for He wants you to give it up and go back Dont

The earnestness of her words was unmistakable Hamel felt the thrill of
coming events

Why not

Dont ask me she begged Only if you are brave if you have feeling
for others keep the Tower if it be for only a week Hush

The door had been noiselessly opened The doctor appeared and advanced
to the table with a grave little bow

Mr Fentolin he said has been kind enough to suggest that I take a
glass of wine with you My presence is not needed upstairs Mr Hamel
he added I am glad sir to make your acquaintance I have for a long
time been a great admirer of your fathers work

He took his place at the head of the table and filling his glass
bowed towards Hamel Once more Gerald and his sister relapsed almost
automatically into an indifferent and cultivated silence Hamel found
civility towards the newcomer difficult Unconsciously his attitude
became that of the other two He resented the intrusion He found
himself regarding the advent of Doctor Sarson as possessing some
secondary significance It was almost as though Mr Fentolin preferred
not to leave him alone with his niece and nephew

Nevertheless his voice when he spoke was clear and firm




CHAPTER XIV

Mr Fentolin on leaving the diningroom steered his chair with great
precision through the open wroughtiron doors of a small lift at the
further end of the hall which Doctor Sarson who stepped in with him
promptly directed to the second floor Here they made their way to the
room in which Mr Dunster was lying Doctor Sarson opened the door and
looked in Almost immediately he stood at one side out of sight of Mr
Dunster and nodded to Mr Fentolin

If there is any trouble he whispered send for me I am better away
for the present My presence only excites him

Mr Fentolin nodded

You are right he said Go down into the diningroom I am not sure
about that fellow Hamel and Gerald is in a queer temper Stay with
them See that they are not alone

The doctor silently withdrew and Mr Fentolin promptly glided past him
into the room Mr John P Dunster in his night clothes was sitting on
the side of the bed Standing within a few feet of him watching him
all the time with the subtle intentness of a cat watching a mouse stood
Meekins Mr Dunsters head was still bound although the bandage had
slipped a little apparently in some struggle His face was chalklike
and he was breathing quickly

So youve come at last he exclaimed a little truculently Are you
Mr Fentolin

Mr Fentolin gravely admitted his identity His eyes rested upon his
guest with an air of tender interest His face was almost beautiful

You are the owner of this houseI am underneath your roofis that
so

This is certainly St Davids Hall Mr Fentolin replied It really
appears as though your conclusions were correct

Then will you tell me why I am kept a prisoner here

Mr Fentolins expression was for a moment clouded He seemed hurt

A prisoner he repeated softly My dear Mr Dunster you have surely
forgotten the circumstances which procured for me the pleasure of this
visit the condition in which you arrived hereonly after all a very
few hours ago

The circumstances Mr Dunster declared drily are to me still
inexplicable At Liverpool Street Station I was accosted by a young man
who informed me that his name was Gerald Fentolin and that he was on
his way to The Hague to play in a golf tournament His story seemed
entirely probable and I permitted him a seat in the special train I had
chartered for Harwich There was an accident and I received this blow to
my headonly a trifling affair after all I come to my senses to find
myself here I do not know exactly what part of the world you call this
but from the fact that I can see the sea from my window it must be some
considerable distance from the scene of the accident I find that
my dressingcase has been opened my pocketbook examined and I am
apparently a prisoner I ask you Mr Fentolin for an explanation

Mr Fentolin smiled reassuringly

My dear sir he said my dear Mr Dunster I believe I may have
the pleasure of calling youyour conclusions seem to me just a little
melodramatic My nephewGerald Fentolindid what I consider the
natural thing under the circumstances You had been courteous to him
and he repaid the obligation to the best of his ability The accident to
your train happened in a dreary part of the country some thirty
miles from here My nephew adopted a course which I think under the
circumstances was the natural and hospitable one He brought you to his
home There was no hospital or town of any importance nearer

Very well Mr Dunster decided I will accept your version of the
affair I will then up to this point acknowledge myself your debtor
But will you tell me why my dressingcase has been opened my clothes
removed and a pocketbook containing papers of great importance to me
has been tampered with

My dear Mr Dunster his host repelled calmly you surely cannot
imagine that you are among thieves Your dressingcase was opened and
the contents of your pocketbook inspected with a view to ascertaining
your address or the names of some friends with whom we might
communicate

Am I to understand that they are to be restored to me then Mr
Dunster demanded

Without a doubt yes Mr Fentolin assured him You however are not
fit for anything at the present moment but to return to your bed from
which I understand you rose rather suddenly a few minutes ago

On the contrary Mr Dunster insisted I am feeling absolutely
well enough to travel I have an appointment on the Continent of great
importance as you may judge by the fact that at Liverpool Street I
chartered a special train I trust that nothing in my manner may have
given you offence but I am anxious to get through with the business
which brought me over to this side of the water I have sent for you to
ask that my pocketbook dressingcase and clothes be at once restored
to me and that I be provided with the means of continuing my journey
without a moments further delay

Mr Fentolin shook his head very gently very regretfully but also
firmly

Mr Dunster he pleaded do be reasonable Think of all you have been
through I can quite sympathise with you in your impatience but I am
forced to tell you that the doctor who has been attending you since
the moment you were brought into this house has absolutely forbidden
anything of the sort

Mr Dunster seemed for a moment to struggle for composure

I am an American citizen he declared I am willing to listen to the
advice of any physician but so long as I take the risk I am not bound
to follow it

In the present case I decline to follow it I ask for facilities to
leave this house at once

Mr Fentolin sighed

In your own interests he said calmly they will not be granted to
you

Mr Dunster had spoken all the time like a man struggling to preserve
his selfcontrol There were signs now that his will was ceasing to
serve him His eyes flashed fire his voice was raised

Will not be granted to me he repeated Do you mean to say then
that I am to be kept here against my will

Mr Fentolin made no immediate reply With the delicate fingers of his
right hand he pushed back the hair from his forehead He looked at his
questioner soothingly as one might look at a spoiled child

Against my will Mr Dunster repeated raising his voice still higher
Mr Fentolin if the truth must be told I have heard of you before and
been warned against you I decline to accept any longer the hospitality
of your roof I insist upon leaving it If you will not provide me with
any means of doing so I will walk

He made a motion as though to rise from the bed Meekins hand very
gently closed upon his arm One could judge that the grip was like a
grip of iron

Dear me Mr Fentolin said this is really very unreasonable of
you If you have heard of me Mr Dunster you ought to understand
that notwithstanding my unfortunate physical trouble I am a person
of consequence and position in this county I am a magistrate exhigh
sheriff and a great landowner here I think I may say without boasting
that I represent one of the most ancient families in this country
Why therefore should you treat me as though it were to my interest to
inveigle you under my roof and keep you there for some guilty purpose
Cannot you understand that it is for your own good I hesitate to part
with you

I understand nothing of the sort Mr Dunster exclaimed angrily Let
us bring this nonsense to an end I want my clothes and if you wont
lend me a car or a trap Ill walk to the nearest railway station

Mr Fentolin shook his head

I am quite sure he said that you are not in a position to travel
Even in the diningroom just now I heard a disturbance for which I was
told that you were responsible

I simply insisted upon having my clothes Mr Dunster explained Your
servant refused to fetch them Perhaps I lost my temper If so I am
sorry I am not used to being thwarted

A few days rest Mr Fentolin began

A few days rest be hanged Mr Dunster interrupted fiercely Listen
Mr Fentolin he added with the air of one making a last effort to
preserve his temper the mission with which I am charged is one of
greater importance than you can imagine So much depends upon it that
my own life if that is in danger would be a mere trifle in comparison
with the issues involved If I am not allowed to continue upon my
journey at once the consequences may be more serious than I can tell
you to you and yours to your own country ThereI am telling you a
great deal but I want you to understand that I am in earnest I have a
mission which I must perform and which I must perform quickly

You are very mysterious Mr Fentolin murmured

I will leave nothing to chance Mr Dunster continued Send this man
who seems to have constituted himself my jailer out of earshot and I
will tell you even more

Mr Fentolin turned to Meekins

You can leave the room for a moment he ordered Wait upon the
threshold

Meekins very unwillingly turned to obey

You will excuse me sir he objected doubtfully but I am not at all
sure that he is safe

Mr Fentolin smiled faintly

You need have no fear Meekins he declared I am quite sure that
you are mistaken I think that Mr Dunster is incapable of any act of
violence towards a person in my unfortunate position I am willing to
trust myself with himperfectly willing Meekins

Meekins with ponderous footsteps left the room and closed the door
behind him Mr Fentolin leaned a little forward in his chair It
seemed as though he were on springs The fingers of his right hand
had disappeared in the pocket of his black velvet dinnercoat He was
certainly prepared for all emergencies

Now Mr Dunster he said softly you can speak to me without
reserve

Mr Dunster dropped his voice His tone became one of fierce eagerness

Look here he exclaimed I dont think you ought to force me to give
myself away like this but after all you are an Englishman with a
stake in your country and I presume you dont want her to take a
back seat for the next few generations Listen here Its to save your
country that I want to get to The Hague without a seconds delay I tell
you that if I dont get there if the message I convey doesnt reach
its destination you may find an agreement signed between certain Powers
which will mean the greatest diplomatic humiliation which Great Britain
has ever known Aye and more than that Mr Dunster continued It
may be that the bogey youve been setting before yourself for all
these years may trot out into life and you may find St Davids Hall a
barrack for German soldiers before many months have passed

Mr Fentolin shook his head in gentle disbelief

You are speaking to one he declared who knows more of the political
situation than you imagine In my younger days I was in the Foreign
Office Since my unfortunate accident I have preserved the keenest
interest in politics I tell you frankly that I do not believe you As
the Powers are grouped at present I do not believe in the possibility
of a successful invasion of this country

Perhaps not Mr Dunster replied eagerly but the grouping of the
Powers as it has existed during the last few years is on the eve of a
great change I cannot take you wholly into my confidence I can only
give you my word of honour as a friend to your country that the message
I carry is her only salvation Having told you as much as that I do
not think I am asking too much if I ask you for my clothes and
dressingcase and for the fastest motorcar you can furnish me with
I guess I can get from here to Yarmouth and from there I can charter
something which will take me to the other side

Mr Fentolin raised the little gold whistle to his lips and blew it very
softly Meekins at once entered closing the door behind him He moved
silently to the side of the man who had risen now from the bed and who
was standing with his hand grasping the post and his eyes fixed upon Mr
Fentolin as though awaiting his answer

Our conversation the latter said calmly has reached a point Mr
Dunster at which I think we may leave it for the moment You have
told me some very surprising things I perceive that you are a more
interesting visitor even than I had thought

He raised his left hand and Meekins who seemed to have been waiting
for some signal of the sort suddenly with a movement of his knee and
right arm flung Dunster back upon the bed The man opened his mouth
to shout but already with lightninglike dexterity his assailant
had inserted a gag between his teeth Treating his struggles as the
struggles of a baby Meekins next proceeded to secure his wrists with
handcuffs He then held his feet together while he quietly wound a coil
of cord around them Mr Fentolin watched the proceedings from his chair
with an air of pleased and critical interest

Very well done Meekinsvery neatly done indeed he exclaimed As
I was saying Mr Dunster he continued turning his chair our
conversation has reached a point at which I think we may safely leave
it for a time We will discuss these matters again Your pretext of a
political mission is of course an absurd one but fortunately you have
fallen into good hands Take good care of Mr Dunster Meekins I can
see that he is a very important personage We must be careful not to
lose sight of him

Mr Fentolin steered his chair to the door opened it and passed
out On the landing he blew his whistle the lift almost immediately
ascended A moment or two later he glided into the diningroom The
three men were still seated around the table A decanter of wine almost
empty was before Doctor Sarson whose pallid cheeks however were as
yet unflushed

At last my dear guest Mr Fentolin exclaimed turning to Hamel I
am able to return to you If you will drink no more wine let us have
our coffee in the library you and I I want to talk to you about the
Tower




CHAPTER XV

Mr Fentolin led the way to a delightful little corner of his library
where before the open grate recently piled with hissing logs an easy
chair had been drawn He wheeled himself up to the other side of the
hearthrug and leaned back with a little air of exhaustion The butler
who seemed to have appeared unsummoned from somewhere among the shadows
served coffee and poured some old brandy into large and wonderfully thin
glasses

Why my house should be turned into an asylum to gratify the hospitable
instincts of my young nephew I cannot imagine Mr Fentolin grumbled
A most extraordinary person our visitor I can assure you Quite
violent too he was at first

Have you had any outside advice about his condition Hamel inquired

Mr Fentolin glanced across those few feet of space and looked at Hamel
with swift suspicion

Why should I he asked Doctor Sarson is fully qualified and the
case seems to present no unusual characteristics

Hamel sipped his brandy thoughtfully

I dont know why I suggested it he admitted I only thought that an
outside doctor might help you to get rid of the fellow

Mr Fentolin shrugged his shoulders

After all he said the matter is of no real consequence Doctor
Sarson assures me that we shall be able to send him on his way very
shortly In the meantime Mr Hamel what about the Tower

What about it Hamel asked selecting a cigar from the box which had
been pushed to his side I am sure I havent any wish to inconvenience
you

I will be quite frank Mr Fentolin declared I do not dispute your
right for a moment On the other hand my few hours daily down there
have become a habit with me I do not wish to give them up Stay here
with us Mr Hamel You will be doing us a great kindness My nephew and
niece have too little congenial society Make up your mind to give us a
fortnight of your time and I can assure you that we will do our best to
make yours a pleasant stay

Hamel was a little taken aback

Mr Fentolin he said I couldnt think of accepting your hospitality
to such an extent My idea in coming here was simply to fulfil an old
promise to my father and to rough it at the Tower for a week or so and
when that was over I dont suppose I should ever be likely to come back
again You had better let me carry out that plan and afterwards the
place shall be entirely at your disposal

You dont quite understand Mr Fentolin persisted a little
irritably I sit there every morning I want for instance to be there
tomorrow morning and the next morning and the morning afterwards to
finish a little seascape I have commenced Nowhere else will do Call it
a whim or what you will I have begun the picture and I want to finish
it

Well you can sit there all right Hamel assured him I shall be out
playing golf or fishing I shall do nothing but sleep there

And very uncomfortable you will be Mr Fentolin pointed out You
have no servant I understand and there is no one in the village fit to
look after you Think of my thirtynine empty rooms my books here my
gardens my motorcars my young people entirely at your service You
can have a suite to yourself You can disappear when you like To all
effects and purposes you will be the master of St Davids Hall Be
reasonable Dont you think now that you can spend a fortnight more
pleasantly under such circumstances than by playing the misanthrope down
at the Tower

Please dont think Hamel begged that I dont appreciate your
hospitality I should feel uncomfortable however if I paid you a visit
of the length you have suggested Come I dont see he added why my
occupation of the Tower should interfere with you I should be away from
it by about nine or ten oclock every morning I should probably only
sleep there Cant you accept the use of it all the rest of the time I
can assure you that you will be welcome to come and go as though it were
entirely your own

Mr Fentolin had lit a cigarette and was watching the blue smoke curl
upwards to the ceiling

Youre an obstinate man Mr Hamel he sighed but I suppose you must
have your own way Bytheby you would only need to use the upstairs
room and the sittingroom You will not need the outhouserather more
than an outhouse though isnt it I mean the shed which leads out from
the kitchen where the lifeboat used to be kept

I dont think I shall need that Hamel admitted a little
hesitatingly

To tell you the truth Mr Fentolin continued among my other hobbies
I have done a little inventing I work sometimes at a model there It is
foolish perhaps but I wish no one to see it Do you mind if I keep the
keys of the place

Not in the least Hamel replied Tell me what direction do your
inventions take Mr Fentolin

Before you go Mr Fentolin promised I will show you my little model
at work Until then we will not talk of it Now come be frank with me
Shall we exchange ideas for a little time Will you talk of books They
are my daily friends I have thousands of them beloved companions on
every side Or will you talk of politics or travel Or would you
rather be frivolous with my niece and nephew That I think is Esther
playing

To be quite frank Hamel declared bluntly I should like to talk to
your niece

Mr Fentolin smiled as though amused His amusement however was
perfectly goodnatured

If you will open this door he said you will see another one exactly
opposite to you That is the drawingroom You will find Esther there
Before you go will you pass me the Quarterly Review Thank you

Hamel crossed the hall opened the door of the room to which he had been
directed and made his way towards the piano Esther was there playing
softly to herself with eyes half closed He came and stood by her side
and she stopped abruptly Her eyes questioned him Then her fingers
stole once more over the keys more softly still

I have just left your uncle Hamel said He told me that I might come
in here

Yes she murmured

He was very hospitable Hamel continued He wanted me to remain here
as a guest and not go to the Tower at all

And you

I am going to the Tower he said I am going there tomorrow or the
day after

The music swelled beneath her fingers

For how long

For a week or so I am just giving your uncle time to clear out his
belongings I am leaving him the outhouse

He asked you to leave him that she whispered

Yes

You are not going in there at all

Not at all

Again she played a little more loudly for a few moments Then the music
died away once more

What reason did he give for keeping possession of that

Another hobby Hamel replied He is an inventor it seems He has the
model of something there he would not tell me what

She shivered a little and her music drifted away She bent over the
keys her face hidden from him

You will not go away just yet she asked softly You are going to
stay for a few days at any rate

Without a doubt he assured her I am altogether my own master

Thank God she murmured

He leaned with his elbow against the top of the piano looking down at
her Since dinnertime she had fastened a large red rose in the front of
her gown

Do you know that this is all rather mysterious he said calmly

What is mysterious she demanded

The atmosphere of the place your uncles queer aversion to my having
the Tower your visitor upstairs who fights with the servants while we
are at dinner your uncle himself whose will seems to be law not only
to you but to your brother who must be of age I should think and who
seems to have plenty of spirit

We live here both of us she told him He is our guardian

Naturally Hamel replied and yet it may have been my fancy of
course but at dinnertime I seemed to get a queer impression

Tell it me she insisted her fingers breaking suddenly into a
livelier melody Tell it me at once You were there all the time I
could see you watching Tell me what you thought

She had turned her head now and her eyes were fixed upon his They were
large and soft capable he knew of infinite expression Yet at that
moment the light that shone from them was simply one of fear half
curious half shrinking

My impression he said was that both of you disliked and feared Mr
Fentolin yet for some reason or other that you were his abject slaves

Her fingers seemed suddenly inspired with diabolical strength and
energy Strange chords crashed and broke beneath them She played some
unfamiliar music with tense and fierce energy Suddenly she paused and
rose to her feet

Come out on to the terrace she invited You are not afraid of cold

He followed her without a word She opened the French windows and they
stepped out on to the long broad stone promenade The night was dark
and there was little to be seen The light was burning at the entrance
to the waterway a few lights were twinkling from the village The soft
moaning of the sea was distinctly audible She moved to the edge of the
palisading He followed her closely

You are right Mr Hamel she said I think that I am more afraid of
him than any woman ever was of any man in this world

Then why do you live here he protested You must have other
relations to whom you could go And your brotherwhy doesnt he do
somethinggo into one of the professions He could surely leave easily
enough

I will tell you a secret she answered calmly Perhaps it will help
you to understand You know my uncles condition You know that it was
the result of an accident

I have heard so he replied gravely

She clutched at his arm

Come she said

Side by side they walked the entire length of the terrace When they
reached the corner they were met with a fierce gust of wind She
battled along and he followed her They were looking inland now
There were no lights visiblenothing but dark chaotic emptiness From
somewhere below him he could hear the wind in the treetops

This way she directed Be careful

They walked to the very edge of the palisading It was scarcely more
than a couple of feet high She pointed downwards

Can you see she whispered

By degrees his eyes faintly penetrated the darkness It was as though
they were looking down a precipice The descent was perfectly sheer for
nearly a hundred feet At the bottom were the pine trees

Come here again in the morning she whispered You will see then I
brought you here to show you the place It was here that the accident
happened

What accident

Mr Fentolins she continued It was here that he went over He was
picked up with both his legs broken They never thought that he would
live

Hamel shivered a little As his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness
he saw more distinctly than ever the sheer fall the tops of the bending
trees below

What a horrible thing he exclaimed

It was more horrible than you know she continued dropping her voice
a little almost whispering in his ear I do not know why I tell you
thisyou a strangerbut if I do not tell some one I think that the
memory of it will drive me mad It was no accident at all Mr Fentolin
was thrown over

By whom he asked

She clung to his arm for a moment

Ah dont ask me she begged No one knows My uncle gave out as
soon as he was conscious that it was an accident

That at any rate was fine of him Hamel declared

She shivered

He was proud at least of our family name Whatever credit he deserves
for it he must have It was owing to that accident that we became his
slaves nothing but thathis absolute slaves to wait upon him if he
would hand and foot You see he has never been able to marry His life
was of course ruined So the burden came to us We took it up little
thinking what was in store for us Five years ago we came here to live
Gerald wanted to go into the army I wanted to travel with my mother
Gerald has done all the work secretly but he has never been allowed
to pass his examinations I have never left England except to spend two
years at the strictest boardingschool in Paris to which I was taken
and fetched away by one of his creatures We live here with the shadow
of this thing always with us We are his puppets If we hesitate to do
his bidding he reminds us So far we have been his creatures body and
soul Whether it will go on I cannot sayoh I cannot say It is bad
for us butthere is mother too He makes her life a perfect hell

A roar of wind came booming once more across the marshes bending
the trees which grew so thickly beneath them and which ascended
precipitately to the back of the house The French windows behind
rattled She looked around nervously

I am afraid of him all the time she murmured He seems to overhear
everythinghe or his creatures Listen

They were silent for several moments He whispered in her ear so closely
that through the darkness he could see the fire in her eyes

You are telling me half he said Tell me everything Who threw your
uncle over the parapet

She stood by his side motionless and trembling

It was the passion of a moment she said at last speaking hoarsely
I cannot tell you Listen Listen

There is no one near Hamel assured her It is the wind which shakes
the windows I wish that you would tell me everything I would like to
be your friend Believe me I have that desire really There are so
many things which I do not understand That it is dull here for you
of course is natural but there is something more than that You
seem always to fear something Your uncle is a selfish man naturally
although to look at him he seems to have the disposition of an angel
But beyond that is there anything of which you are afraid You seem all
the time to live in fear

She suddenly clutched his hand There was nothing of affection in her
touch and yet he felt a thrill of delight

There are strange things which happen here she whispered things
which neither Gerald nor I understand Yet they terrify us I think
that very soon the end will come Neither of us can stand it very much
longer We have no friends Somehow or other he seems to manage to keep
us always isolated

I shall not go away from here Hamel said firmly at present Mind
I am not at all sure that living this solitary life as you do you have
not become a little overnervous that you have not exaggerated the fear
of some things To me your uncle seems merely quixotic and egregiously
selfish However that may be I am going to remain She clutched once
more at his arm her finger was upraised They listened together From
somewhere behind them came the clear low wailing of a violin

It is Mr Fentolin she whispered Please come in let us go in at
once He only plays when he is excited I am afraid Oh I am afraid
that something is going to happen

She was already round the corner and on her way to the main terrace He
followed her closely




CHAPTER XVI

Let us follow the example of all great golfers Hamel said Let
us for this morning at any rate imagine that your whole world is
encompassed within these eighteen holes We have been sent here in a
moment of good humour by your tyrant uncle The sun shines and the wind
is from the west Why not

That is all very well for you she retorted smiling but I have
topped my drive

Purely an incident he assured her The vicissitudes of the game do
not enter into the question I have driven a ball far above my usual
form but I am not gloating over it I prefer to remember only that I am
going to spend the next two hours with you

She played her shot and they walked for a little way together She was
suddenly silent

Do you know she said finally just a little gravely I am not at all
used to speeches of this sort

Then you ought to be he declared Nothing but the lonely life you
have been living has kept you from hearing them continually

She laughed a little at the impotence of her rebuff and paused for a
moment to make her next shot Hamel standing a little on one side
watched her appraisingly Her short grey tweed skirt was obviously the
handiwork of an accomplished tailor Her grey stockings and suede shoes
were immaculate and showed a care for her appearance which pleased him
Her swing too revealed a grace the grace of long arms and a supple
body at which previously he had only guessed The sunshine seemed to
have brought out a copper tinge from her abundant brown hair

Do you know he remarked I think I am beginning to like your uncle
Great idea of his sending us off here directly after breakfast

Her face darkened for a moment and he realised his error The same
thought indeed had been in both their minds Mr Fentolins courteous
suggestion had been offered to them almost in the shape of a command It
was scarcely possible to escape from the reflection that he had desired
to rid himself of their presence for the morning

Of course he went on I knew that these links were goodquite
famous arent they

I have played on so few others she told him I learned my golf here
with King the professional

He took off his cap and handed it to his caddy He himself was beginning
already to look younger The long blue waves came rippling up the
creeks The salt wind soft with sunshine blew in their faces The
marshes on the landward side were mauve with lavender blossom In the
distance the redtiled cottages nestled deep among a background of
green trees and rising fields

This indeed is a land of peace he declared If I hadnt to give you
quite so many strokes I should be really enjoying myself

You dont play like a man who has been living abroad for a great
many years she remarked Tell me about some of the places you have
visited

Dont let us talk seriously he begged Ill tell you of them but let
it be later on This morning I feel that the spring air is getting into
my head I have an absurd desire to talk nonsense

So far she admitted you havent been altogether unsuccessful

If you are alluding he replied to the personal remarks I was
emboldened to make on my way here I can only say that they were excused
by their truthfulness

I am not at all sure that you have known me long enough to tell me what
colours suit me she demurred

Then what will you say he enquired if I admire the angle of that
quill in your hat

Dont do it she laughed If you continue like this I may have to go
home

You have sent the car away he reminded her cheerfully You would
simply have to sit upon the balcony and reflect upon your wasted
morning

I decline to talk upon the putting green she said It puts me off
If you will stand perfectly quiet and say nothing I will play the
like

They moved off presently to the next teeing ground

I dont believe this nonsense is good for our golf she said

It is immensely good for us as human beings he protested

They had played the ninth hole and turned for home On their right now
was a shimmering stretch of wet sand and a thin line of sea in the
distance The tide receding had left little islands of virgin sand
grass tufted the home of countless seagulls A brownsailed fishing
boat was racing for the narrow entrance to the tidal way

I am beginning to understand what there is about this coast which
fascinated my father so he remarked

Are you she answered gravely Years ago I used to love it but not
now

He tried to change the subject but the gloom had settled upon her face
once more

You dont know what it is like she went on as they walked side by
side after their balls to live day and night in fear with no one to
talk tono one that is to say who is not under the same shadow Even
the voices of the wind and the sea and the screaming of the birds seem
to bring always an evil message There is nothing kindly or hopeful even
in the sunshine At night when the tide comes thundering in as it does
so often at this time of the year one is afraid There is so much to
make one afraid

She had turned pale again notwithstanding the sunshine and the
freshening wind He laid his hand lightly upon her arm She suffered his
touch without appearing to notice it

Ah you mustnt talk like that he pleaded Do you know what you make
me feel like

She came back from the world of her own unhappy imaginings

Really I forgot myself she declared with a little smile Never
mind it does one good sometimes One up are you Henceforth then
golfall the rigour of the game mind

He fell in with her mood and their conversation touched only upon the
game On the last green he suffered defeat and acknowledged it with a
little grimace

If I might say so Miss Fentolin he protested you are a little too
good for your handicap I used to play a very reasonable scratch myself
but I cant give you the strokes

She smiled

Doubtless your long absence abroad she began slowly has affected
your game

I was round in eightyone he grumbled

You must have travelled in many countries she continued where golf
was an impossibility

Naturally he admitted Let us stay and have lunch and try again

She shook her head with a little sigh of regret

You see the car is waiting she pointed out We are expected home I
shant be a minute putting my clubs away

They sped swiftly along the level road towards St Davids Hall Far
in the distance they saw it built upon that strange hill with the
sunlight flashing in its windows He looked at it long and curiously

I think he said that yours is the most extraordinarily situated
house I have ever seen Fancy a gigantic mound like that in the midst of
an absolutely flat marsh

She nodded

There is no other house quite like it in England she said I suppose
it is really a wonderful place Have you looked at the pictures

Not carefully he told her

You must before you leave she insisted Mr Fentolin is a great
judge and so was his father

Their road curved a little to the sea and at its last bend they were
close to the pebbly ridge on which the Tower was built He touched the
electric bell and stopped the car

Do let us walk along and have a look at my queer possession once more
he begged Luncheon you told me is not till halfpast one and it is
a quarter to now

She hesitated for a moment and then assented They left the car and
walked along the little track bordered with white posts which led on
to the ridge To their right was the village separated from them only
by one level stretch of meadowland in the background the hall They
turned along the raised dike just inside the pebbly beach and she
showed her companion the narrow waterway up to the village At its
entrance was a tall iron upright with a ladder attached and a great
lamp at the top

That is to show them the way in at night isnt it he asked

She nodded

Yes she told him Mr Fentolin had it placed there And yet she
went on curiously enough since it was erected there have been more
wrecks than ever

It doesnt seem a dangerous beach he remarked

She pointed to a spot about fifty yards from the Tower It was the
spot to which the woman whom he had met on the day of his arrival had
pointed

You cant see them she said they are always out of sight even
when the tide is at the lowestbut there are some hideous sunken rocks
there The Daggers they call them One or two fishing boats have been
lost on them trying to make the village When Mr Fentolin put up the
lamp every one thought that it would be quite safe to try and get in
at night This winter though there have been three wrecks which no
one could understand It must be something in the currents or a sort of
optical illusion because in the last shipwreck one man was saved
and he swore that at the time they struck the rock they were headed
straight for the light

They had reached the Tower now Hamel became a little absorbed They
walked around it and he tried the front door He found as he had
expected that it opened readily He looked around him for several
moments

Your uncle has been here this morning he remarked quietly

Very likely

That outhouse he continued must be quite a large place Have you
any idea what it is he works upon there

None she answered

He looked around him once more

Mr Fentolin has been preparing for my coming he observed I see
that he has moved a few of his personal things

She made no reply only she shivered a little as she stepped back into
the sunshine

I dont believe you like my little domicile he remarked as they
started off homeward

I dont she admitted curtly

In the train he reminded her you seemed rather to discourage my
coming here Yet last night after dinner

I was wrong she interrupted I should have said nothing and yet I
couldnt help it I dont suppose it will make any difference

Make any difference to what


I cannot tell you she confessed Only I have a strange antipathy to
the place I dont like it My uncle sometimes shuts himself up here
for quite a long time We have an idea Gerald and I that things happen
here sometimes which no one knows of When he comes back he is moody
and illtempered or else half mad with excitement He isnt always the
amiable creature whom you have met He has the face of an angel but
there are times

Well dont lets talk about him Hamel begged as her voice faltered
Now that I am going to stay in the neighbourhood for a few days you
must please remember that it is partly your responsibility You are not
going to shut yourself up are you Youll come and play golf again

If he will let me she promised

I think he will let you right enough Hamel observed Between you
and me I rather think he hates having me down at the Tower at all
He will encourage anything that takes me away even as far as the Golf
Club

They were approaching the Hall now She was looking once more as she
had looked last night She had lost her colour her walk was no longer
buoyant She had the air of a prisoner who after a brief spell of
liberty enters once more the place of his confinement Gerald came
out to meet them as they climbed the stone steps which led on to
the terrace He glanced behind as he greeted them and then almost
stealthily took a telegram from his pocket

This came for you he remarked handing it to Hamel I met the boy
bringing it out of the office

Hamel tore it open with a word of thanks Gerald stood in front of him
as he read

If you wouldnt mind putting it away at once he asked a little
uncomfortably You see the telegraph office is in the place and my
uncle has a queer rule that every telegram is brought to him before it
is delivered

Hamel did not speak for a moment He was looking at the few words
scrawled across the pink sheet with a heavy black pencil

 Make every enquiry in your neighbourhood
 for an American John P Dunster entrusted
 with message of great importance addressed to
 Von Dusenberg The Hague Is believed to
 have been in railway accident near Wymondham
 and to have been taken from inn by young man
 in motorcar Suggest that he is being
 improperly detained

Hamel crumpled up the telegram and thrust it into his pocket

Bytheby he asked as they ascended the steps what did you say the
name of this poor fellow was who is lying ill upstairs

Gerald hesitated for a moment Then he answered as though a species of
recklessness had seized him

He called himself Mr John P Dunster




CHAPTER XVII

Mr Fentolin having succeeded in getting rid of his niece and his
somewhat embarrassing guest for at least two hours was seated in his
study planning out a somewhat strenuous morning when his privacy was
invaded by Doctor Sarson

Our guest the latter announced in his usual cold and measured tones
has sent me to request that you will favour him with an interview

Mr Fentolin laid his pen deliberately down

So soon he murmured Very well Sarson I am at his service Say
that I will come at once

Mr Fentolin lost no time in paying this suggested visit Mr John P
Dunster shaved and clothed was seated in an easychair drawn up to
the window of his room smoking what he was forced to confess was a very
excellent cigar He turned his head as the door opened and Mr Fentolin
waved his hand pleasantly

Really he declared this is most agreeable I had an idea Mr
Dunster that I should find you a reasonable person Men of your
eminence in their profession usually are

Mr Dunster looked at the speaker curiously

And what might my profession be Mr Fentolin he asked You seem to
know a great deal about me

It is true Mr Fentolin admitted I do know a great deal

Mr Dunster knocked the ash from his cigar

Well he said I have been the hearer of several important
communications from my side of the Atlantic to England and to the
Continent and I have always known that there was a certain amount
of risk in the business Once I had an exceedingly narrow shave he
continued reminiscently but this is the first time I have ever been
dead up against it and I dont mind confessing that youve fairly got
me puzzled Who the mischief are you Mr Fentolin and what are you
interfering about

Mr Fentolin smiled queerly

I am what you see he replied I am one of those unfortunate human
beings who by reason of their physical misfortunes are cut off from
the world of actual life I have been compelled to seek distraction in
strange quarters I have wealthgreat wealth I suppose I should say
an inordinate curiosity a talent for intrigue As to the direction in
which I carry on my intrigues or even as to the direct interests which
I study that is a matter Mr Dunster upon which I shall not gratify
your curiosity nor anybody elses But you see I am admitting freely
that it does interest me to interfere in great affairs

But how on earth did you get to know about me Mr Dunster asked and
my errand You couldnt possibly have got me here in an ordinary way It
was an entire fluke

There you speak with some show of reason I have a nephew whom you
have met who is devoted to me

Mr Gerald Fentolin Mr Dunster remarked drily

Precisely Mr Fentolin declared Well I admit frankly the truth of
what you say Yourshall we say capture was by way of being a gigantic
fluke My nephews instructions simply were to travel down by the train
to Harwich with you to endeavour to make your acquaintance to follow
you on to your destination and if any chance to do so occurred to
relieve you of your pocketbook That however I never ventured to
expect What really happened was as you have yourself suggested almost
in the nature of a miracle My nephew showed himself to be possessed of
gifts which were a revelation to me He not only succeeded in travelling
with you by the special train but after its wreck he was clever enough
to bring you here instead of delivering you over to the mercies of a
village doctor I really cannot find words to express my appreciation of
my nephews conduct

I could Mr Dunster muttered very easily

Mr Fentolin sighed gently

Perhaps our points of view might differ

We have spent a very agreeable few minutes in explanations Mr
Dunster continued Would it be asking too much if I now suggest that we
remove the buttons from our foils

Why not Mr Fentolin assented smoothly Your first question to
yourself under these circumstances would naturally be What does Mr
Fentolin want with me I will answer that question for you All that I
askit is really very littleis the word agreed upon

Mr Dunster held his cigar a little way off and looked steadfastly at
his host for a moment So you have interpreted my cipher

Mr Fentolin spread out the palms of his hands in a delicate gesture

My dear Mr Dunster he said one of the simplest I think that was
ever strung together I am somewhat of an authority upon ciphers

I gather Mr Dunster went on although his cigar was burning itself
out that you have broken the seal of my dispatches

Mr Fentolin closed his eyes as though he had heard a discord

Nothing so clumsy as that I hope he murmured gently I will not
insult a person of your experience and intelligence by enumerating the
various ways in which the seal of a dispatch may be liquefied It is
quite true that I have read with much pleasure the letter which you are
carrying from a certain group of very distinguished men to a certain
person now in The Hague The letter however is replaced in its
envelope the seal is still there You need have no fears whatever
concerning it All that I require is that one word from you

And if I give you that one word Mr Dunster asked

If you give it me as I think you will Mr Fentolin replied suavely
I shall then telegraph to my agent or rather I should say to a dear
friend of mine who lives at The Hague and that single word will be
cabled by him from The Hague to New York

And in that case Mr Dunster enquired what would become of me

You would give us the great pleasure of your company here for a very
brief visit Mr Fentolin answered We should I can assure you do
our very best to entertain you

And the dispatch which I am carrying to The Hague

Would remain here with you

Mr Dunster knocked the ash from his cigar Without being a man of great
parts he was a shrewd person possessed of an abundant stock of common
sense He applied himself for a few moments to a consideration of this
affair without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion

Come Mr Fentolin he said at last you must really forgive me but
I cant see what youre driving at You are an Englishman are you not

I am an Englishman Mr Fentolin confessed or rather he added with
ghastly humour I am half an Englishman

You are I am sure Mr Dunster continued a person of intelligence
a wellread person a person of perceptions Surely you can see and
appreciate the danger with which your country is threatened

With regard to political affairs Mr Fentolin admitted I consider
myself unusually well postedin fact the study of the diplomatic
methods of the various great Powers is rather a hobby of mine

Yet Mr Dunster persisted you do not wish this letter delivered
to that little conference in The Hague which you must be aware is now
sitting practically to determine the fate of your nation

I do not wish Mr Fentolin replied I do not intend that that
letter shall be delivered Why do you worry about my point of view
I may have a dozen reasons I may believe that it will be good for my
country to suffer a little chastisement

Or you may Mr Dunster suggested glancing keenly at his host be
the paid agent of some foreign Power

Mr Fentolin shook his head

My means he pointed out should place me above such suspicion My
income I really believe is rather more than fifty thousand pounds a
year I should not enter into these adventures which naturally are not
entirely dissociated from a certain amount of risk for the purposes of
financial gain

Mr Dunster was still mystified

Granted that you do so from pure love of adventure he declared
I still cannot see why you should range yourself on the side of your
countrys enemies

In time Mr Fentolin observed even that may become clear to you At
present welljust that word if you please

Mr Dunster shook his head

No he decided I do not think so I cannot make up my mind to tell
you that word

Mr Fentolin gave no sign of annoyance or even disappointment He simply
sighed His eyes were full of a gentle sympathy his face indicated a
certain amount of concern

You distress me he declared Perhaps it is my fault I have not made
myself sufficiently clear The knowledge of that word is a necessity to
me Without it I cannot complete my plans Without it I very much fear
dear Mr Dunster that your sojourn among us may be longer than you have
any idea of

Mr Dunster laughed a little derisively

Weve passed those days he remarked Ive done my best to enter
into the humour of this situation but there are limits You cant keep
prisoners in English country houses nowadays There are a dozen ways
of communicating with the outside world and when thats once done it
seems to me that the position of Squire Fentolin of St Davids Hall
might be a little peculiar

Mr Fentolin smiled very slightly still very blandly

Alas my stalwart friend I fear that you are by nature an optimist I
am not a betting man but I am prepared to bet you a hundred pounds to
one that you have made your last communication with the outside world
until I say the word

Mr Dunster was obviously plentifully supplied with either courage or
bravado for he only laughed

Then you had better make up your mind at once Mr Fentolin how soon
that word is to be spoken or you may lose your money he remarked

Mr Fentolin sat very quietly in his chair

You mean then he asked that you do not intend to humour me in this
little matter

I do not intend Mr Dunster assured him to part with that word
to you or to any one else in the the world When my message has been
presented to the person to whom it has been addressed when my trust is
discharged then and then only shall I send that cablegram That moment
can only arrive at the end of my journey

Mr Fentolin leaned now a little forward in his chair His face was
still smooth and expressionless but there was a queer sort of meaning
in his words

The end of your journey he said grimly may be nearer than you
think

If I am not heard of in The Hague tomorrow at the latest Mr Dunster
pointed out remember that before many more hours have passed I shall
be searched for even to the far corners of the earth

Let me assure you Mr Fentolin promised serenely that though your
friends search for you up in the skies or down in the bowels of the
earth they will not find you My hidingplaces are not as other
peoples

Mr Dunster beat lightly with his square blunt forefinger upon the
table which stood by his side

Thats not the sort of talk I understand he declared curtly Let us
understand one another if we can What is to happen to me if I refuse
to give you that word

Mr Fentolin held his hand in front of his eyes as though to shut out
some unwelcome vision

Dear me he exclaimed how unpleasant Why should you force me to
disclose my plans Be content dear Mr Dunster with the knowledge
of this one fact we cannot part with you I have thought it over
from every point of view and I have come to that conclusion always
presuming he went on that the knowledge of that little word of which
we have spoken remains in its secret chamber of your memory

Mr Dunster smoked in silence for a few minutes

I am very comfortable here he remarked

You delight me Mr Fentolin murmured

Your cook Mr Dunster continued has won my heartfelt appreciation
Your cigars and wines are fit for any nobleman Perhaps after all this
little rest is good for me

Mr Fentolin listened attentively

Do not forget he said that there is always a limit fixed whether
it be one day two days or three days

A limit to your complacence I presume

Mr Fentolin assented

Obviously then Mr Dunster concluded you wish those who sent me
to believe that my message has been delivered Yet there I must confess
that you puzzle me What I cannot see is to put it bluntly where you
come in Any one of the countries represented at this little conference
would only be the gainers by the miscarriage of my message which is
without doubt so far as they are concerned of a distasteful nature
Your own country alone could be the sufferer Now what interest in the
world then is there leftwhat interest in the world can you possibly
representwhich can be the gainer by your present action

Mr Fentolins eyes grew suddenly a little brighter There was a light
upon his face strange to witness

The power which is to be the gainer he said quietly is the power
encompassed by these walls

He touched his chest his long slim fingers were folded upon it

When I meet a man whom I like he continued softly I take him into
my confidence Picture me if you will as a kind of Puck Havent you
heard that with the decay of the body comes sometimes a malignant growth
in the brain a Calibanlike desire for evil to fall upon the world
a desire to escape from the loneliness of suffering the isolation of
black misery

Mr John P Dunster let his cigar burn out He looked steadfastly at
this strange little figure whose chair had imperceptibly moved a little
nearer to his

You know what the withholding of this message you carry may mean
Mr Fentolin proceeded You come here bearing to Europe the word of a
great people a people whose voice is powerful enough even to still
the gathering furies I have read your ciphered message It is what I
feared It is my will mineMiles Fentolinsthat that message be not
delivered

I wonder Mr Dunster muttered under his breath whether you are in
earnest

In your heart Mr Fentolin told him you know that I am I can
see the truth in your face Now for the first time you begin to
understand

To a certain extent Mr Dunster admitted Where I am still in
the dark however is why you should expect that I should become
your confederate It is true that by holding me up and obstructing my
message you may bring about the evil you seek but unless that word is
cabled back to New York and my senders believe that my message has been
delivered there can be no certainty What has been trusted to me as the
safest means of transmission might in an emergency be committed to a
cable

Excellent reasoning Fentolin agreed For the very reasons you name
that word will be given

Mr Dunsters face was momentarily troubled There was something in the
still cold emphasis of this mans voice which made him shiver

Do you think Mr Fentolin went on that I spend a great fortune
buying the secrets of the world that I live from day to day with the
risk of ignominious detection always hovering about medo you think
that I do this and am yet unprepared to run the final risks of life and
death Have you ever talked with a murderer Mr Dunster Has curiosity
ever taken you within the walls of Sing Sing Have you sat within the
cell of a doomed man and felt the thrill of his touch of his close
presence Well I will not ask you those questions I will simply tell
you that you are talking to one now

Mr Dunster had forgotten his extinct cigar He found it difficult to
remove his eyes from Mr Fentolins face He was half fascinated half
stirred with a vague mysterious fear Underneath these wild words ran
always that hard note of truth

You seem to be in earnest he muttered

I am Mr Fentolin assured him quietly I have more than once been
instrumental in bringing about the death of those who have crossed my
purposes I plead guilty to the weakness of Nero Suffering and death
are things of joy to me There

I am not sure Mr Dunster said slowly that I ought not to wring
your neck

Mr Fentolin smiled His chair receded an inch or two There was never a
time when his expression had seemed more seraphic

There is no emergency of that sort he remarked for which I am not
prepared

His little revolver gleamed for a minute beneath his cuff He backed his
chair slowly and with wonderful skill towards the door

We will fix the period of your probation Mr Dunster atsay
twentyfour hours he decided Please make yourself until then
entirely at home My cook my cellar my cigar cabinets are at your
disposal If some happy impulse he concluded should show you the
only reasonable course by dinnertime it would give me the utmost
pleasure to have you join us at that meal I can promise you a cheque
beneath your plate which even you might think worth considering wine
in your glass which kings might sigh for cigars by your side which even
your Mr Pierpont Morgan could not buy Au revoir

The door opened and closed Mr Dunster sat staring into the open space
like a man still a little dazed




CHAPTER XVIII

The beautiful but somewhat austere front of St Davids Hall seemed in
a sense transformed as Hamel and his companion climbed the worn grey
steps which led on to the broad sweep of terrace Evidently visitors had
recently arrived A dark rather goodlooking woman with pleasant round
face and a ceaseless flow of conversation was chattering away to
Mr Fentolin By her side stood another woman who was a stranger to
Hamelthin still elegant with tired worn face and the shadow of
something in her eyes which reminded him at once of Esther She wore a
large picture hat and carried a little Pomeranian dog under her arm In
the background an insignificantlooking man with grey sidewhiskers and
spectacles was beaming upon everybody Mr Fentolin waved his hand and
beckoned to Hamel and Esther as they somewhat hesitatingly approached

This is one of my fortunate mornings you see Esther he exclaimed
smiling Lady Saxthorpe has brought her husband over to lunch Lady
Saxthorpe he added turning to the woman at his side let me present
to you the son of one of the first men to realise the elusive beauty of
our coast This is Mr Hamel son of Peter Hamel RAthe Countess of
Saxthorpe

Lady Saxthorpe who had been engaged in greeting Esther held out her
hand and smiled goodhumouredly at Hamel

I know your fathers work quite well she declared and I dont
wonder that you have made a pilgrimage here They tell me that he
painted nineteen picturespictures of importance that is to saywithin
this little area of ten miles Do you paint Mr Hamel

Not at all Hamel answered

Our friend Hamel Mr Fentolin intervened woos other and sterner
muses He fights nature in distant countries spans her gorges with iron
bridges stems the fury of her rivers and carries to the boundary of
the world that little twin line of metal which brings men like ants to
the workheaps of the universe My dear Florence he added suddenly
turning to the woman at his other side for the moment I had forgotten
You have not met our guest yet Hamel this is my sisterinlaw Mrs
Seymour Fentolin

She held out her hand to him unnaturally thin and white covered with
jewels Again he saw something in her eyes which stirred him vaguely

It is so nice that you are able to spend a few days with us Mr
Hamel she said quietly I am sorry that I have been too indisposed to
make your acquaintance earlier

And Mr Fentolin continued you must know my young friend here too
Mr HamelLord Saxthorpe

The latter shook hands heartily with the young man

I knew your father quite well he announced Queer thing he used to
hang out for months at a time at that little shanty on the beach there
Hardest work in the world to get him away He came over to dine with us
once or twice but we saw scarcely anything of him I hope his son will
not prove so obdurate

You are very kind Hamel murmured

Mr Hamel came into these parts to claim his fathers property Mr
Fentolin said However I have persuaded him to spend a day or two up
here before he transforms himself into a misanthrope What of his golf
Esther eh

Mr Hamel plays very well indeed the girl replied

Your niece was too good for me Hamel confessed

Mr Fentolin smiled

The politeness of this younger generation he remarked keeps the
truth sometimes hidden from us I perceive that I shall not be told who
won Lady Saxthorpe you are fortunate indeed in the morning you have
chosen for your visit There is no sun in the world like an April sun
and no corner of the earth where it shines with such effect as here
Look steadily to the eastward of that second dike and you will see the
pink light upon the sands which baffled every one until our friend
Hamel came and caught it on his canvas

I do see it Lady Saxthorpe murmured What eyes you have Mr
Fentolin What perception for colour

Dear lady Mr Fentolin said I am one of those who benefit by the
law of compensations On a morning like this I can spend hours merely
feasting my eyes upon this prospect and I can find if not happiness
the next best thing The world is full of beautiful places but the
strange part of it is that beauty has countless phases and each phase
differs in some subtle and unexplainable manner from all others Look
with me fixedly dear Lady Saxthorpe Look indeed with more than your
eyes Look at that flush of wild lavender where it fades into the sands
on one side and strikes the emerald green of that wet seamoss on the
other Look at the liquid blue of that tongue of sea which creeps along
its bed through the yellow sands through the dark meadowland which
creeps and oozes and widens till in an hours time it will have become a
river Look at my sand islands virgin from the foot of man the home of
seagulls the islands of a day There may be other and more beautiful
places There is none quite like this

I pity you no longer Lady Saxthorpe asserted fervently The eyes of
the artist are a finer possession than the limbs of the athlete

The butler announced luncheon and they all trooped in Hamel found
himself next to Lady Saxthorpe

Dear Mr Fentolin has been so kind she confided to him as they took
their places I came in fear and trembling to ask for a very small
cheque for my dear brothers diocese My brother is a colonial bishop
you know Can you imagine what Mr Fentolin has given me

Hamel wondered politely Lady Saxthorpe continued with an air of
triumph

A thousand pounds Just fancy thata thousand pounds And some
people say he is so difficult she went on dropping her voice Mrs
Hungerford came all the way over from Norwich to beg for the infirmary
there and he gave her nothing

What was his excuse Hamel asked

I think he told her that it was against his principles to give to
hospitals Lady Saxthorpe replied He thinks that they should be
supported out of the rates

Some people have queer ideas of charity Hamel remarked Now I am
afraid that if I had been Mr Fentolin I would have given the thousand
pounds willingly to a hospital but not a penny to a mission

Mr Fentolin looked suddenly down the table He was some distance away
but his hearing was wonderful

Ah my dear Hamel he said believe me missions are very wonderful
things It is only from a very careful study of their results that I
have brought myself to be a considerable supporter of those where I have
some personal knowledge of the organisation Hospitals on the other
hand provide for the poor what they ought to be able to provide for
themselves The one thing to avoid in the giving away of money is
pauperisation What do you think Florence

His sisterinlaw who was seated at the other end of the table looked
across at him with a bright but stereotyped smile

I agree with you of course Miles I always agree with you Mr
Fentolin has the knack of being right about most things she continued
turning to Lord Saxthorpe His judgment is really wonderful

Wish we could get him to come and sit on the bench sometimes then
Lord Saxthorpe remarked heartily Our neighbours in this part of the
world are not overburdened with brains Bytheby he went on that
reminds me You havent got such a thing as a mysterious invalid in the
house have you

There was a moments rather curious silence Mr Fentolin was sitting
like a carved figure with a glass of wine half raised to his lips
Gerald had broken off in the middle of a sentence and was staring at
Lord Saxthorpe Esther was sitting perfectly still her face grave and
calm her eyes alone full of fear Lord Saxthorpe was not an observant
man and he continued quite unconscious of the sensation which his
question had aroused

Sounds a silly thing to ask you doesnt it Theyre all full of it
at Wells though I sat on the bench this morning and went into the
policestation for a moment first Seems theyve got a long dispatch
from Scotland Yard about a missing man who is supposed to be in this
part of the world He came down in a special train on Tuesday nightthe
night of the great floodand his train was wrecked at Wymondham After
that he was taken on by some one in a motorcar Colonel Renshaw wanted
me to allude to the matter from the bench but it seemed to me that it
was an affair entirely for the police

As though suddenly realising the unexpected interest which his words had
caused Lord Saxthorpe brought his sentence to a conclusion and glanced
enquiringly around the table

A man could scarcely disappear in a civilised neighbourhood like
this Mr Fentolin remarked quietly but there is a certain amount of
coincidence about your question May I ask whether it was altogether a
haphazard one

Absolutely Lord Saxthorpe declared The idea seems to be that the
fellow was brought to one of the houses in the neighbourhood and we
were all rather chaffing one another this morning about it Inspector
Yardleythe stout fellow with the beard you knowwas just starting
off in his dogcart to make enquiries round the neighbourhood If any
one in fiction wants a type of the ridiculous detective there he is
readymade

The coincidence of your question Mr Fentolin said smoothly is
certainly a strange one The mysterious stranger is within our gates

Lady Saxthorpe who had been out of the conversation for far too long
laid down her knife and fork

My dear Mr Fentolin she exclaimed My dear Mrs Fentolin This is
really most exciting Do tell us all about it at once I thought that
the man was supposed to have been decoyed away in a motorcar Do you
know his name and all about him

There are a few minor points Mr Fentolin murmured such as his
religious convictions and his size in boots which I could not swear
about but so far as regards his name and his occupation I think I can
gratify your curiosity He is a Mr John P Dunster and he appears
to be the representative of an American firm of bankers on his way to
Germany to conclude a loan

God bless my soul Lord Saxthorpe exclaimed wonderingly The fellow
is actually here under this roof But who brought him How did he find
his way

Better ask Gerald Mr Fentolin replied He is the abductor It seems
that they both missed the train from Liverpool Street and Mr Dunster
invited Gerald to travel down in his special train Very kind of him
but might have been very unlucky for Gerald As you know they got
smashed up at Wymondham and Gerald feeling in a way responsible for
him brought him on here quite properly I think Sarson has been
looking after him but I am afraid he has slight concussion of the
brain

I shall remember this all my life Lord Saxthorpe declared solemnly
as one of the most singular coincidences which has ever come within my
personal knowledge Perhaps after lunch Mr Fentolin you will let some
of your people telephone to the policestation at Wells There really is
an important enquiry respecting this man I should not be surprised he
added dropping his voice a little for the benefit of the servants to
find that Scotland Yard needed him on their own account

In that case Mr Fentolin remarked he is quite safe for Sarson
tells me there is no chance of his being able to travel at any rate for
twentyfour hours

Lady Saxthorpe shivered

Arent you afraid to have him in the house she asked a man who is
really and actually wanted by Scotland Yard When one considers that
nothing ever happens here except an occasional shipwreck in the winter
and a flowershow in the summer it does sound positively thrilling I
wonder what he has done

They discussed the subject of Mr Dunsters possible iniquities
Meanwhile a young man carrying his hat in his hand had slipped in past
the servants and was leaning over Mr Fentolins chair He laid two
or three sheets of paper upon the table and waited while his employer
glanced them through and dismissed him with a little nod

My wireless has been busy this morning Mr Fentolin remarked We
seem to have collected about forty messages from different battleships
and cruisers There must be a whole squadron barely thirty miles out

You dont really think Lady Saxthorpe asked that there is any fear
of war do you Mr Fentolin

He answered her with a certain amount of gravity Who can tell The
papers this morning were bad This conference at The Hague is still
unexplained Frances attitude in the matter is especially mysterious

I am a strong supporter of Lord Roberts Lord Saxthorpe said and I
believe in the vital necessity of some scheme for national service At
the same time I find it hard to believe that a successful invasion of
this country is within the bounds of possibility

I quite agree with you Lord Saxthorpe Mr Fentolin declared
smoothly All the same this Hague Conference is a most mysterious
affair The papers this morning are ominously silent about the fleet
From the tangle of messages we have picked up I should say without a
doubt that some form of mobilisation is going on in the North Sea If
Lady Saxthorpe thinks it warm enough shall we take our coffee upon the
terrace

The terrace by all means her ladyship assented rising from her
place What a wonderful man you are Mr Fentolin with your wireless
telegraphy and your telegraph office in the house and telephones Does
it really amuse you to be so modern

To a certain extent yes Mr Fentolin sighed as he guided his chair
along the hall When my misfortune first came I used to speculate a
good deal upon the Stock Exchange That was really the reason I went in
for all these modern appliances

And now she asked What use do you make of them now

Mr Fentolin smiled quietly He looked out seaward beyond the
skyline from whence had come to him through the clouds that tangle
of messages

I like to feel he said that the turning wheel of life is not
altogether out of earshot I like to dabble just a little in the
knowledge of these things

Lord Saxthorpe came strolling up to them

You wont forget to telephone about this guest of yours he asked
fussily

It is already done Mr Fentolin assured him My dear sister why so
silent

Mrs Fentolin turned slowly towards him She too had been standing
with her eyes fixed upon the distant sealine Her face seemed
suddenly to have aged her forced vivacity to have departed Her little
Pomeranian rubbed against her feet in vain Yet at the sound of Mr
Fentolins voice she seemed to come back to herself as though by magic

I was looking where you were looking she declared lightly just
trying to see a little way beyond So silly isnt it ChowChow you
bad little dog come and you shall have your dinner

She strolled off humming a tune to herself Lord Saxthorpe watched her
with a shadow upon his plain goodhumoured face

Somehow or other he remarked quietly Mrs Fentolin never seems to
have got over the loss of her husband does she How long is it since he
died

Eight years Mr Fentolin replied It was just six months after my
own accident

I am losing a great deal of sympathy for you Mr Fentolin Lady
Saxthorpe confessed coming over to his side You have so many
resources there is so much in life which you can do You paint as
we all know exquisitely They tell me that you play the violin like a
master You have unlimited time for reading and they say that you are
one of the greatest living authorities upon the politics of Europe Your
morning paper must bring you so much that is interesting

It is true Mr Fentolin admitted that I have compensations which no
one can guess at compensations which appeal to me more as time steals
on And yet

He stopped short

And yet Lady Saxthorpe repeated interrogatively

Mr Fentolin was watching Gerald drive golf balls from the lawn beneath
He pointed downwards

I was like that when I was his age he said quietly




CHAPTER XIX

Mr Fentolin remained upon the terrace long after the departure of his
guests He had found a sunny corner out of the wind and he sat there
with a telescope by his side and a budget of newspapers upon his
knee On some pretext or another he had detained all the others of the
household so that they formed a little court around him Even Hamel
who had said something about a walk had been induced to stop by an
appealing glance from Esther Mr Fentolin was in one of his most
loquacious moods For some reason or other the visit of the Saxthorpes
seemed to have excited him He talked continually with the briefest
pauses Every now and then he gazed steadily across the marshes through
his telescope

Lord Saxthorpe he remarked has I must confess greatly excited
my curiosity as to the identity of our visitor Such a harmlesslooking
person he seems to be causing such a commotion Gerald dont you feel
your responsibility in the matter

Yes sir I do Gerald replied with unexpected grimness I feel my
responsibility deeply

Mr Fentolin who was holding the telescope to his eye touched Hamel on
the shoulder

My young friend he said your eyes are better than mine You see the
road there Look along it between the white posts as far as you can
What do you make of that black speck

Hamel held the telescope to his eye and steadied it upon the little
tripod stand

It looks like a horse and trap he announced Good Mr Fentolin
declared It seemed so to me but I was not sure My eyes are weak this
afternoon How many people are in the trap

Two Hamel answered I can see them distinctly now One man is
driving another is sitting by his side They are coming this way

Mr Fentolin blew his whistle Meekins appeared almost directly His
master whispered a word in his ear The man at once departed

Let me make use of your eyes once more Mr Fentolin begged About
these two men in the trap Mr Hamel Is one of them by any chance
wearing a uniform

They both are Hamel replied The man who is driving is wearing a
peaked hat He looks like a police inspector The man by his side is an
ordinary policeman

Mr Fentolin sighed gently

It is very interesting he said Let us hope that we shall not see an
arrest under my roof I should feel it a reflection upon my hospitality
I trust I sincerely trust that this visit does not bode any harm to
Mr John P Dunster

Gerald rose impatiently to his feet and swung across the terrace Mr
Fentolin however called him back

Gerald he advised better not go away The inspector may desire to
ask you questions You will have nothing to conceal It was a natural
and delightful impulse of yours to bring the man who had befriended you
and who was your companion in that disaster straight to your own home
for treatment and care It was an admirable impulse my boy You have
nothing to be ashamed of

Shall I tell him too Gerald began

Be careful Gerald

Mr Fentolins words seemed to be charged with a swift rapierlike
note The boy broke off in his speech He looked at Hamel and was
silent

Dear me Mrs Fentolin murmured I am sure there is no need for us
to talk about this poor man as though anybody had done anything wrong
in having him here This I suppose must be the Inspector Yardley whom
Lord Saxthorpe spoke of

A very intelligentlooking officer I am sure Mr Fentolin remarked
Gerald go and meet him if you please I should like to speak to him
out here

The dogcart had drawn up at the front door and the inspector had
already alighted Gerald intervened as he was in the act of questioning
the butler

Mr Fentolin would like to speak to you inspector he said if you
will come this way

The inspector followed Gerald and saluted the little group solemnly Mr
Fentolin held out his hand

You got my telephone message inspector he asked

We have not received any message that I know of sir the inspector
replied I have come over here in accordance with instructions received
from headquartersin fact from Scotland Yard

Quite so Mr Fentolin assented Youve come over I presume to make
enquiries concerning Mr John P Dunster

That is the name of the gentleman sir

I only understood today from my friend Lord Saxthorpe Mr Fentolin
continued that Mr Dunster was being enquired about as though he had
disappeared My nephew brought him here after the railway accident at
Wymondham since when he has been under the care of my own physician I
trust that you have nothing serious against him

My first duty sir the inspector pronounced is to see the gentleman
in question

By all means Mr Fentolin agreed Gerald will you take the
inspector up to Mr Dunsters rooms Or stop I will go myself

Mr Fentolin started his chair and beckoned the inspector to follow him
Meekins who was waiting inside the hall escorted them by means of the
lift to the second floor They made their way to Mr Dunsters room Mr
Fentolin knocked softly at the door It was opened by the nurse

How is the patient Mr Fentolin enquired

Doctor Sarson appeared from the interior of the room

Still unconscious he reported Otherwise the symptoms are
favourable He is quite unfit the doctor added looking steadily at
the inspector to be removed or questioned

There is no idea of anything of the sort Mr Fentolin explained It
is Inspector Yardleys duty to satisfy himself that Mr Dunster is here
It is necessary for the inspector to see your patient so that he can
make his report at headquarters

Doctor Sarson bowed

That is quite simple sir he said Please step in

They all entered the room which was large and handsomely furnished
Through the open windows came a gentle current of fresh air Mr Dunster
lay in the midst of all the luxury of fine linen sheets and embroidered
pillowcases The inspector looked at him stolidly

Is he asleep he asked

The doctor shook his head

It is the third day of his concussion he whispered He is still
unconscious He will remain in the same condition for another two days
After that he will begin to recover

Mr Fentolin touched the inspector on the arm

You see his clothing at the foot of the bed he pointed out His
linen is marked with his name That is his dressingcase with his name
painted on it

I am quite satisfied sir the inspector announced I will not
intrude any further

They left the room Mr Fentolin himself escorted the inspector into the
library and ordered whisky and cigars

I dont know whether I am unreasonably curious Mr Fentolin remarked
but is it really true that you have had enquiries from Scotland Yard
about the poor fellow upstairs

We had a very important enquiry indeed sir the inspector replied
I have instructions to telegraph all I have been able to discover
immediately

Pardon my putting it plainly Mr Fentolin asked but is our friend a
criminal

I wouldnt go so far as that sir the inspector answered I know
of no charge against him I dont know that I have the right to say so
much he added sipping his whisky and soda but putting two and two
together I should rather come to the conclusion that he was a person of
some political importance

Not a criminal at all

Not as I know of the inspector assented That isnt the way I read
the enquiries at all

You relieve me Mr Fentolin declared Now what about his
possessions

Theres a man coming down shortly from Scotland Yard the inspector
announced a little gloomily My orders were to touch nothing but to
locate him

Well youve succeeded so far Mr Fentolin remarked Here he is
and here I think he will stay until some days after your friend from
Scotland Yard can get here

It does seem so indeed the inspector agreed To me he looks
terrible ill But theres one thing sure hes having all the care and
attention thats possible And now sir Ill not intrude further upon
your time Ill just make my report and youll probably have a visit
from the Scotland Yard man sometime within the next few days

Mr Fentolin escorted the inspector to his dogcart shook hands with
him and watched him drive off Only Mrs Seymour Fentolin remained upon
the terrace He glided over to her side

My dear Florence he asked where are the others

Mr Hamel and Esther have gone for a walk she answered Gerald has
disappeared somewhere Has anythingis everything all right

Naturally Mr Fentolin replied easily All that the inspector
desired was to see Mr Dunster He has seen him The poor fellow was
unfortunately unconscious but our friend will at least be able to
report that he was in good hands and well cared for

Unconscious Mrs Fentolin repeated I thought that he was better

One is always subject to those slight relapses in an affair of
concussion Mr Fentolin explained

Mrs Fentolin laid down her work and leaned a little towards her
brotherinlaw Her hand rested upon his Her voice had fallen to a
whisper

Miles she said forgive me but are you sure that you are not
getting a little out of your depth Remember that there are some risks
which are not worth while

Quite true he answered And there are some risks my dear Florence
which are worth every drop of blood in a mans body and every breath
of life The peace of Europe turns upon that man upstairs It is worth
taking a little risk for worth a little danger I have made my plans
and I mean to carry them through Tell me when I was upstairs this
fellow Hamelwas he talking confidentially to Gerald

Not particularly

I am not sure that I trust him Mr Fentolin continued He had a
telegram yesterday from a man in the Foreign Office a telegram which I
did not see He took the trouble to walk three miles to send the reply
to it from another office

But after all Mrs Fentolin protested you know who he is You know
that he is Peter Hamels son He had a definite purpose in coming here

Mr Fentolin nodded

Quite true he admitted But for that Mr Hamel would have found
a little trouble before now As it is he must be watched If any one
comes between me and the things for which I am scheming today they
will risk death

Mrs Fentolin sighed She was watching the figures of Esther and Hamel
far away in the distance picking their way across the last strip of
marshland which lay between them and the sea

Miles she said earnestly you take advice from no one You will go
your own way I know And yet it seems to me that life holds so many
compensations for you without your taking these terrible risks I am not
thinking of any one else I am not pleading to you for the sake of any
one else I am thinking only of yourself I have had a sort of feeling
ever since this man was brought into the house that trouble would come
of it To me the trouble seems to be gathering even now

Mr Fentolin laughed softly a little contemptuously

Presentiments he scoffed are the excuses of cowards Dont be
afraid Florence Remember always that I look ahead Do you think that I
could stay here contented with what you call my compensationsmy art
the study of beautiful things the calm epicureanism of the sedate and
simple life You know very well that I could not do that The craving
for other things is in my heart and blood The excitement which I cannot
have in one way I must find in another and I think that before many
nights have passed I shall lie on my pillow and hear the guns roar
hear the footsteps of the great armies of the world moving into battle
It is for that I live Florence

She took up her knitting again Her eyes were fixed upon the skyline
Twice she opened her lips but twice no words came

You understand he whispered You begin to understand dont you

She looked at him only for a moment and back at her work

I suppose so she sighed




CHAPTER XX

In the middle of that night Hamel sat up in bed awakened with a sudden
start by some sound only the faintest echo of which remained in his
consciousness His nerves were tingling with a sense of excitement He
sat up in bed and listened Suddenly it came againa long low moan of
pain stifled at the end as though repressed by some outside agency He
leaped from his bed hurried on a few clothes and stepped out on to the
landing The cry had seemed to him to come from the further end of the
long corridorin the direction indeed of the room where Mr Dunster
lay He made his way there walking on tiptoe although his feet fell
noiselessly upon the thick carpet A single light was burning from a
bracket in the wall insufficient to illuminate the empty spaces but
enough to keep him from stumbling The corridor towards the south end
gradually widened terminating in a splendid high window with stained
glass a broad seat and a table On the right the end room was Mr
Dunsters apartment and on the left a flight of stairs led to the floor
above Hamel stood quite still listening There was a light in the
room as he could see from under the door but there was no sound of
any one moving Hamel listened intently every sense strained Then
the sound of a stair creaking behind diverted his attention He looked
quickly around Gerald was descending The boys face was white and his
eyes were filled with fear Hamel stepped softly back from the door and
met him at the foot of the stairs

Did you hear that cry he whispered

Gerald nodded

It woke me up What do you suppose it was Hamel shook his head

Some one in pain he replied I dont understand it It came from
this room

You know who sleeps there Gerald asked hoarsely

Hamel nodded

A man with concussion of the brain doesnt cry out like that Besides
did you hear the end of it It sounded as though some one were choking
him Hush

They had spoken only in bated breath but the door of the room before
which they were standing was suddenly opened Meekins stood there
fully dressed his dark heavy face full of somber warning He started
a little as he saw the two whispering together Gerald addressed him
almost apologetically

We both heard the same sound Meekins Is any one ill It sounded like
some one in pain

The man hesitated Then from behind his shoulder came Mr Fentolins
still soft voice There was a little click and Meekins as though
obeying an unseen gesture stepped back Mr Fentolin glided on to the
threshold He was still dressed He propelled his chair a few yards down
the corridor and beckoned them to approach

I am so sorry he said softly that you should have been disturbed
Mr Hamel We have been a little anxious about our mysterious guest
Doctor Sarson fetched me an hour ago He discovered that it was
necessary to perform a very slight operation merely the extraction of
a splinter of wood It is all over now and I think that he will do very
well

Notwithstanding this very plausible explanation Hamel was conscious
of the remains of an uneasiness which he scarcely knew how to put into
words

It was a most distressing cry he observed doubtfully a cry of fear
as well as of pain

Poor fellow Mr Fentolin remarked compassionately I am afraid that
for a moment or two he must have suffered acutely Doctor Sarson is
very clever however and there is no doubt that what he did was for
the best His opinion is that by tomorrow morning there will be a
marvellous change Good night Mr Hamel I am quite sure that you will
not be disturbed again

Hamel neither felt nor showed any disposition to depart

Mr Fentolin he said I hope that you will not think that I am
officious or in any way abusing your hospitality but I cannot help
suggesting that as Dr Sarson is purely your household physician the
relatives of this man Dunster might be better satisfied if some second
opinion were called in Might I suggest that you telephone to Norwich
for a surgeon

Mr Fentolin showed no signs of displeasure He was silent for a moment
as though considering the matter

I am not at all sure Mr Hamel that you are not right he admitted
frankly I believe that the case is quite a simple one but on the
other hand it would perhaps be more satisfactory to have an outside
opinion If Mr Dunster is not conscious in the morning we will
telephone to the Norwich Infirmary

I think it would be advisable Hamel agreed

Good night Mr Fentolin said once more I am sorry that your rest
has been disturbed

Hamel however still refused to take the hint His eyes were fixed upon
that closed door

Mr Fentolin he asked have you any objection to my seeing Mr
Dunster

There was a moments intense silence A sudden light had burned in Mr
Fentolins eyes His fingers gripped the side of his chair Yet when
he spoke there were no signs of anger in his tone It was a marvellous
effort of selfcontrol

There is no reason Mr Hamel he said why your curiosity should not
be gratified Knock softly at the door Gerald

The boy obeyed In a moment or two Doctor Sarson appeared on the
threshold

Our guest Mr Hamel Mr Fentolin explained in a whisper has been
awakened by this poor fellows cry He would like to see him for a
moment

Doctor Sarson opened the door They all passed in on tiptoe The doctor
led the way towards the bed upon which Mr Dunster was lying quite
still His head was bandaged and his eyes closed His face was ghastly
Gerald gave vent to a little muttered exclamation Mr Fentolin turned
to him quickly

Gerald

The boy stood still trembling speechless Mr Fentolins eyes were
riveted upon him The doctor was standing still and dark a motionless
image

Is he asleep Hamel asked

He is under the influence of a mild anaesthetic Doctor Sarson
explained He is doing very well His case is quite simple By
tomorrow morning he will be able to sit up and walk about if he wishes
to

Hamel looked steadily at the figure upon the bed Mr Dunsters
breathing was regular and his eyes were closed but his colour was
ghastly

He doesnt look like getting up for a good many days to come Hamel
observed

The doctor led the way towards the door

The man has a fine constitution he said I feel sure that if you
wish you will be able to talk to him tomorrow

They separated outside in the passage Mr Fentolin bade his guest a
somewhat restrained good night and Gerald mounted the staircase to
his room Hamel however had scarcely reached his door before Gerald
reappeared He had descended the staircase at the other end of the
corridor He stood for a moment looking down the passage The doors were
all closed Even the light had been extinguished

May I come in for a moment please he whispered

Hamel nodded

With pleasure Come in and have a cigarette if you will I shant feel
like sleep for some time

They entered the room and Gerald threw himself into an easychair
near the window Hamel wheeled up another chair and produced a box of
cigarettes

Queer thing your dropping across that fellow in the way you did he
remarked Just shows how one may disappear from the world altogether
and no one be a bit the wiser

The boy was sitting with folded arms His expression was one of deep
gloom

I only wish Id never brought him here he muttered I ought to have
known better

Hamel raised his eyebrows Isnt he as well off here as anywhere else

Do you think that he is Gerald demanded looking across at Hamel

There was a brief silence

We can scarcely do your uncle the injustice Hamel remarked of
imagining that he can possibly have any reason or any desire to deal
with that man except as a guest

Do you really believe that Gerald asked

Hamel rose to his feet

Look here young man he said this is getting serious You and I are
at crosspurposes If you like you shall have the truth from me

Go on

I was warned about your uncle before I came down into this part of
the world Hamel continued quietly I was told that he is a dangerous
conspirator a man who sticks at nothing to gain his ends a person
altogether out of place in these days It sounds melodramatic but I
had it straight from a friend Since I have been here I have had a
telegramyou brought it to me yourselfasking for information about
this man Dunster It was I who wired to London that he was here It was
through me that Scotland Yard communicated with the police station at
Wells through me that a man is to be sent down from London I didnt
come here as a spydont think that I was coming here anyhow On the
other hand I believe that your uncle is playing a dangerous game I am
going to have Mr John P Dunster put in charge of a Norwich physician
tomorrow

Thank God the boy murmured

Look here Hamel continued what are you doing in this business
anyway You are old enough to know your own mind and to go your own
way

You say that because you dont know Gerald declared bitterly

In a sense I dont Hamel admitted and yet your sister hinted to me
only this afternoon that you and she

Oh I know what she told you the boy interrupted Weve worn the
chains for the last eight years They are breaking her Theyve broken
my mother Sometimes I think they are breaking me But you know there
comes a timethere comes a time when one cant go on Ive seen some
strange things here some that Ive half understood some that I havent
understood at all Ive closed my eyes Ive kept my promise Ive
done his bidding where ever it has led me But you know there is a
timethere is a limit to all things I cant go on I spied on this
man Dunster I brought him here It is I who am responsible for anything
that may happen to him Its the last time

Geralds face was white with pain Hamel laid his hand upon his
shoulder

My boy he said there are worse things in the world than breaking
a promise When you gave it the conditions which were existing at the
time made it perhaps a right and reasonable undertaking but sometimes
the whole of the conditions under which a promise was given change
Then one must have courage enough to be false even to ones word

Have you talked to my sister like that Gerald asked eagerly

I have and I will again Hamel declared Tomorrow morning I leave
this house but before I go I mean to have the affair of this man
Dunster cleared up Your uncle will be very angry with me without a
doubt I dont care But I do want you to trust me if you will and
your sister I should like to be your friend

God knows we need one the boy said simply Good night

Once more the house was quiet Hamel pushed his window wide open and
looked out into the night The air was absolutely still there was no
wind The only sound was the falling of the low waves upon the stony
beach and the faint scrunching of the pebbles drawn back by the ebb
He looked along the row of windows all dark and silent now A rush of
pleasant fancies suddenly chased away the grim depression of the last
few minutes Out of all this sordidness and mystery there remained at
least something in life for him to do A certain aimlessness of purpose
which had troubled him during the last few months had disappeared He
had found an object in life




CHAPTER XXI

Today Hamel declared as he stood at the sideboard the following
morning at breakfasttime and helped himself to bacon and eggs I am
positively going to begin reading I have a case full of books down at
the Tower which I havent unpacked yet

Esther made a little grimace

Look at the sunshine she said There isnt a breath of wind either
I think today that I could play from the mens tees

Hamel sighed as he returned to his place

My good intentions are already half dissipated he admitted

She laughed

How can we attack the other half she asked

Gerald who was also on his way to the sideboard suddenly stopped

Hullo he exclaimed looking out of the window Whos going away this
morning I wonder Theres the RollsRoyce at the door

Hamel too rose once more to his feet The two exchanged swift glances
Moved by a common thought they both started for the door only to find
it suddenly opened before them Mr Fentolin glided into the room

Uncle Gerald exclaimed

Mr Fentolin glanced keenly around the room

Good morning everybody he said My appearance at this hour of the
morning naturally surprises you As a matter of fact I have been up for
quite a long time Esther dear give me some coffee will you and be
sure that it is hot If any of you want to say goodby to Mr John P
Dunster youd better hurry out

You mean that he is going Hamel asked incredulously

He is going Mr Fentolin admitted I wash my hands of the man
He has given us an infinite amount of trouble has monopolised Doctor
Sarson when he ought to have been attending upon mea little more hot
milk if you please Estherand now although he really is not fit
to leave his room he insists upon hurrying off to keep an appointment
somewhere on the Continent The little operation we spoke of last night
was successful as Doctor Sarson prophesied and Mr Dunster was quite
conscious and able to sit up early this morning We telephoned at six
oclock to Norwich for a surgeon who is now on his way over here
but he will not wait even to see him What can you do with a man so
obstinate

Neither Hamel nor Gerald had resumed their places The former after a
moments hesitation turned towards the door

I think he said that I should like to see the last of Mr Dunster

Pray do Mr Fentolin begged I have said goodby to him myself and
all that I hope is that next time you offer a wayfarer the hospitality
of St Davids Hall Gerald he may be a more tractable person This
morning I shall give myself a treat I shall eat an oldfashioned
English breakfast Close the door after you if you please Gerald

Hamel with Gerald by his side hurried out into the hall Just as they
crossed the threshold they saw Mr Dunster wrapped from head to foot
in his long ulster a soft hat upon his head and one of Mr Fentolins
cigars in his mouth step from the bottom stair into the hall and make
his way with somewhat uncertain footsteps towards the front door Doctor
Sarson walked on one side and Meekins held him by the arm He glanced
towards Gerald and his companion and waved the hand which held his
cigar

So long my young friend he exclaimed You see Ive got them to
let me make a start Next time we go about the country in a saloon car
together I hope well have better luck Say but Im groggy about the
knees

Youd better save your breath Doctor Sarson advised him grimly You
havent any to spare now and youll want more than you have before you
get to the end of your journey Carefully down the steps mind

They helped him into the car Hamel and Gerald stood under the great
stone portico watching

Well Im jiggered the boy exclaimed under his breath

Hamel was watching the proceedings with a puzzled frown To his
surprise neither Doctor Sarson nor Meekins were accompanying the
departing man

Hes off right enough Hamel declared as the car glided away Do
you understand it I dont

Gerald did not speak for several moments His eyes were still fixed upon
the back of the disappearing car Then he turned towards Hamel

There isnt much he said softly that Mr Fentolin doesnt know If
that detective was really on his way here there wasnt any chance
of keeping Mr Dunster to himself You see the whole story is common
property And yet theres something about the affair that bothers me

And me Hamel admitted watching the car until it became a speck in
the distance

He was fairly well cornered Gerald concluded as they made their way
back to the diningroom but it isnt like him to let go of anything so
easily

So youve seen the last of our guest Mr Fentolin remarked as Hamel
and Gerald reentered the diningroom A queer fellowalmost a new
type to me Dogged and industrious I should think He hadnt the least
right to travel you know and I think so long as we had taken the
trouble to telephone to Norwich he might have waited to see the
physician Sarson was very angry about it but what can you do with
these fellows who are never ill They scarcely know what physical
disability means Well Mr Hamel and how are you going to amuse
yourself today

I had thought of commencing some reading I brought with me Hamel
replied but Miss Esther has challenged me to another game of golf

Excellent Mr Fentolin declared It is very kind of you indeed
Mr Hamel It is always a matter of regret for me that society in these
parts is so restricted My nephew and niece have little opportunity for
enjoying themselves Play golf with Mr Hamel by all means my dear
child he continued turning to his niece Make the most of this
glorious spring weather And what about you Gerald What are you doing
today

I havent made up my mind yet sir the boy replied

Mr Fentolin sighed

Always that lack of initiative he remarked A lack of initiative is
one of your worst faults I am afraid dear Gerald

The boy looked up quickly For a moment it seemed as though he were
about to make a fierce reply He met Mr Fentolins steady gaze
however and the words died away upon his lips

I rather thought he said of going into Norwich if you could spare
me Captain Holt has asked me to lunch at the Barracks

Mr Fentolin shook his head gently

It is most unfortunate he declared I have a commission for you
later in the day

Gerald continued his breakfast in silence He bent over his plate so
that his face was almost invisible Mr Fentolin was peeling a peach A
servant entered the room

Lieutenant Godfrey sir he announced

They all looked up A trim cleanshaven hardfeatured young man in
naval uniform was standing upon the threshold He bowed to Esther

Very sorry to intrude sir at this hour of the morning he said
briskly Lieutenant Godfrey my name I am flag lieutenant of the
Britannia You cant see her but shes not fifty miles off at this
minute I landed at Sheringham this morning hired a car and made the
best of my way here Message from the Admiral sir

Mr Fentolin smiled genially

We are delighted to see you Lieutenant Godfrey he said Have some
breakfast

You are very good sir the officer answered Business first
Ill breakfast afterwards with pleasure if I may The Admirals
compliments and he would take it as a favour if you would haul down
your wireless for a few days

Haul down my wireless Mr Fentolin repeated slowly

We are doing a lot of manoeuvring within range of you and likely to do
a bit more the young man explained You are catching up our messages
all the time Of course we know theyre quite safe with you but things
get about As yours is only a private installation wed like you if
you dont mind sir to shut up shop for a few days

Mr Fentolin seemed puzzled

But my dear sir he protested we are not at war are we

Not yet the young officer replied but God knows when we shall be
We are under sealed orders anyway and we dont want any risk of our
plans leaking out Thats why we want your wireless disconnected

You need say no more Mr Fentolin assured him The matter is already
arranged Esther let me present Lieutenant Godfreymy niece Miss
Fentolin Mr Gerald Fentolin my nephew Mr Hamel a guest See that
Lieutenant Godfrey has some breakfast Gerald I will go myself and see
my Marconi operator

Awfully good of you sir the young man declared and I am sure we
are very sorry to trouble you In a week or twos time you can go into
business again as much as you like Its only while we are fiddling
around here that the Admirals jumpy about things May my man have a cup
of coffee sir Id like to be on the way back in a quarter of an hour

Mr Fentolin halted his chair by the side of the bell and rang it

Pray make use of my house as your own sir he said gravely From
what you leave unsaid I gather that things are more serious than the
papers would have us believe Under those circumstances I need not
assure you that any help we can render is entirely yours

Mr Fentolin left the room Lieutenant Godfrey was already attacking his
breakfast Gerald leaned towards him eagerly

Is there really going to be war he demanded

Ask those chaps at The Hague Lieutenant Godfrey answered Doing
their best to freeze us out or something All I know is if theres
going to be fighting we are ready for them Bytheby what have you
got wireless telegraphy for here anyway

Its a fad of my uncles Gerald replied Since his accident he
amuses himself in all sorts of queer ways

Lieutenant Godfrey nodded

Poor fellow he said I heard he was a cripple or something of the
sort Forgive my asking butyou people are English arent you

Rather Gerald answered The Fentolins have lived here for hundreds
of years Why do you ask that

Lieutenant Godfrey hesitated He looked for the moment scarcely at his
ease

Oh I dont know he replied The old man was very anxious I should
find out You see a lot of information seems to have got over on
the other side and we couldnt think where it had leaked out except
through your wireless However that isnt likely of course unless
youve got one of these beastly Germans in your receivingroom Now if I
can borrow a cigarette a cigar or a pipe of tobaccoany mortal
thing to smokeIll be off if I may The old man turned me out at
an unearthly hour this morning and in Sheringham all the shops were
closed Steady on young fellow he laughed as Gerald filled his
pockets with cigarettes Well heres good morning to you Miss
Fentolin Good morning sir How long ought it to take me to get to
Sheringham

About forty minutes Gerald told him if your cars any good at all

It isnt much was the somewhat dubious reply However well shove
along You in the Service he enquired as they walked down the hall
together

Hope I shall be before long Gerald answered Im going into the
army though

Have to hurry up wont you

Gerald sighed

Its a little difficult for me Heres your car Good luck to you

My excuses to Mr Fentolin Lieutenant Godfrey shouted and many
thanks

He jumped into the automobile and was soon on his way back Gerald
watched him until he was nearly out of sight On the knoll two of the
wireless operators were already at work Mr Fentolin sat in his chair
below watching The blue sparks were flashing A message was just being
delivered Presently Mr Fentolin turned his chair and with Meekins by
his side made his way back to the house He passed along the hall and
into his study Gerald who was on his way to the diningroom heard the
ring of the telephone bell and the call for the trunk special line He
hesitated for a moment Then he made his way slowly down towards the
study and stood outside the door listening In a moment he heard Mr
Fentolins clear voice very low yet very penetrating

The Mediterranean Fleet will be fortyseven hours before it comes
together was the message he heard The Channel Fleet will manoeuvre
off Sheerness waiting for it The North Sea Fleet is seventeen units
under nominal strength

Gerald turned the handle of the door slowly and entered Mr Fentolin
was just replacing the receiver on its stand He looked up at his
nephew and his eyebrows came together

What do you mean by this he demanded Dont you know that I allow no
one in here when I am telephoning on the private wire

Gerald closed the door behind him and summoned up all his courage

It is because I have heard what you were saying over the telephone that
I am here he declared I want to know to whom you were sending that
message which you have intercepted outside




CHAPTER XXII

Mr Fentolin sat for a moment in his chair with immovable face Then he
pointed to the door which Gerald had left open behind him

Close that door Gerald

The boy obeyed Mr Fentolin waited until he had turned around again

Come and stand over here by the side of the table he directed

Gerald came without hesitation He stood before his uncle with folded
arms There was something else besides sullenness in his face this
morning something which Mr Fentolin was quick to recognise

I do not quite understand the nature of your question Gerald Mr
Fentolin began It is unlike you You do not seem yourself Is there
anything in particular the matter

Only this Gerald answered firmly I dont understand why this naval
fellow should come here and ask you to close up your wireless because
secrets have been leaking out and a few moments afterwards you should
be picking up a message and telephoning to London information which was
surely meant to be private Thats all Ive come to ask you about it

You heard the message then

I did

You listenedat the keyhole

I listened outside Gerald assented doggedly I am glad I listened
Do you mind answering my question

Do I mind Mr Fentolin repeated softly Really Gerald your
politeness your consideration your good manners astound me I am
positively deprived of the power of speech

Ill wait here till it comes to you again then the boy declared
bluntly Ive waited on you hand and foot done dirty work for you put
up with your illhumours and your tyranny and never grumbled But there
is a limit Youve made a poor sort of creature of me but even the
worm turns you know When it comes to giving away secrets about the
movements of our navy at a time when we are almost at war I strike

Melodramatic almost dramatic but alas so inaccurate Mr Fentolin
sighed Is this a fit of the heroics boy or what has come over you
Have you by any chanceforgotten

Mr Fentolins voice seemed suddenly to have grown in volume His eyes
dilated he himself seemed to have grown in size Gerald stepped a
little back He was trembling but his expression had not changed

No I havent forgotten Theres a great debt we are doing our best to
pay but theres such a thing as asking too much theres such a thing
as drawing the cords to snapping point Im speaking for Esther and
mother as well as myself We have been your slaves in a way I suppose
we are willing to go on being your slaves Its the burden that Fate
has placed around our necks and well go through with it All I want
to point out is that there are limits and it seems to me that we are up
against them now

Mr Fentolin nodded He had the air of a man who wishes to be
reasonable

You are very young my boy he said very young indeed Perhaps that
is my fault for not having let you see more of the world You have got
some very queer ideas into your head A little too much novel reading
lately eh I might treat you differently I might laugh at you and send
you out of the room I wont Ill tell you what you ask Ill explain
what you find so mysterious The person to whom I have been speaking is
my stockbroker

Your stockbroker Gerald exclaimed

Mr Fentolin nodded

Mr Bayliss he continued of the firm of Bayliss Hundercombe 
Dunn Throgmorton Court Mr Bayliss is a man of keen perceptions
He understands exactly the effect of certain classes of news upon the
market The message which I have just sent to him is practically common
property It will be in the Daily Mail tomorrow morning The only thing
is that I have sent it to him just a few minutes sooner than any one
else can get it There is a good deal of value in that Gerald I do not
mind telling you that I have made a large fortune through studying the
political situation and securing advance information upon matters of
this sort That fortune some day will probably be yours It will be you
who will benefit Meanwhile I am enriching myself and doing no one any
harm

But how do you know Gerald persisted that this message would
ever have found its way to the Press It was simply a message from one
battleship to another It was not intended to be picked up on land
There is no other installation but ours that could have picked it up
Besides it was in code I know that you have the code but the others
havent

Mr Fentolin yawned slightly

Ingenious my dear Gerald but inaccurate You do not know that the
message was in code and in any case it was liable to be picked up by
any steamer within the circle You really do treat me my boy rather as
though I were a weird mischiefmaking person with a talent for intrigue
and crime of every sort Look at your suspicions last night I believe
that you and Mr Hamel had quite made up your minds that I meant evil
things for Mr John P Dunster Well I had my chance You saw him
depart

What about his papers

I will admit Mr Fentolin replied that I read his papers They were
of no great consequence however and he has taken them away with him
Mr Dunster as a matter of fact turned out to be rather a maresnest
Now come since you are here finish everything you have to say to me
I am not angry I am willing to listen quite reasonably

Gerald shook his head

Oh I cant he declared bitterly You always get the best of it
Ill only ask you one more question Are you having the wireless hauled
down

Mr Fentolin pointed out of the window Gerald followed his finger
Three men were at work upon the towering spars

You see Mr Fentolin continued tolerantly that I am keeping my
word to Lieutenant Godfrey You are suffering from a little too much
imagination I am afraid It is really quite a good fault Bytheby
how do you get on with our friend Mr Hamel

Very well the boy replied I havent seen much of him

He and Esther are together a great deal eh Mr Fentolin asked
quickly

They seem to be quite friendly

It isnt Mr Hamel by any chance who has been putting these ideas
into your head

No one has been putting any ideas into my head Gerald answered hotly
Its simply what Ive seen and overheard Its simply what I feel
around the whole atmosphere of the place the whole atmosphere you seem
to create around you with these brutes Sarson and Meekins and those
whitefaced smoothtongued Marconi men of yours who cant talk decent
English and the postoffice man who cant look you in the face and
Miss Price who looks as though she were one of the creatures too of
your torture chamber Thats all

Mr Fentolin waited until he had finished Then he waved him away

Go and take a long walk Gerald he advised Fresh air is what you
need fresh air and a little vigorous exercise Run along now and send
Miss Price to me

Gerald overtook Hamel upon the stairs

By this time the latter remarked I suppose that our friend Mr
Dunster is upon the sea

Gerald nodded silently They passed along the corridor The door of
the room which Mr Dunster had occupied was ajar As though by common
consent they both stopped and looked in The windows were all wide
open the bed freshly made The nurse was busy collecting some medicine
bottles and fragments of lint She looked at them in surprise

Mr Dunster has left sir she told them

We saw him go Gerald replied

Rather a quick recovery wasnt it nurse Hamel asked

It wasnt a recovery at all sir the woman declared sharply Hed no
right to have been taken away Its my opinion Doctor Sarson ought to be
ashamed of himself to have permitted it

They couldnt exactly make a prison of the place could they Hamel
pointed out The man after all was only a guest

Thats as it may be sir the nurse replied All the same those that
wont obey their doctors arent fit to be allowed about alone Thats
the way I look at it

Mrs Fentolin was passing along the corridor as they issued from the
room She started a little as she saw them

What have you two been doing in there she asked quickly

We were just passing Hamel explained We stopped for a moment to
speak to the nurse

Mr Dunster has gone she said You saw him go Gerald You saw him
too didnt you Mr Hamel

I certainly did Hamel admitted

Mrs Fentolin pointed to the great north window near which they were
standing through which the clear sunlight streamed a little pitilessly
upon her worn face and mass of dyed hair

You ought neither of you to be indoors for a minute on a morning like
this she declared Esther is waiting for you in the car I think Mr
Hamel

Gerald passed on up the stairs to his room but Hamel lingered A
curious impulse of pity towards his hostess stirred him The morning
sunlight seemed to have suddenly revealed the tragedy of her life
She stood there a tired worn woman with the burden heavy upon her
shoulders

Why not come out with Miss Fentolin and me he suggested We could
lunch at the Golf Club out on the balcony I wish you would Cant you
manage it

She shook her head

Thank you very much she said Mr Fentolin does not like to be
left

Something in the finality of her words seemed to him curiously eloquent
of her state of mind She did not move on She seemed indeed to
have the air of one anxious to say more In that ruthless light the
advantages of her elegant clothes and graceful carriage were suddenly
stripped away from her She was the abject wreck of a beautiful woman
wizened prematurely aged Nothing remained but the eyes which seemed
somehow to have their message for him

Mr Fentolin is a little peculiar you know she went on her voice
shaking slightly with the effort she was making to keep it low He
allows Esther so little liberty she sees so few young people of her own
age I do not know why he allows you to be with her so much Be careful
Mr Hamel

Her voice seemed suddenly to vibrate with a curious note of suppressed
fear Almost as she finished her speech she passed on Her little
gesture bade him remain silent As she went up the stairs she began to
hum scraps of a little French air




CHAPTER XXIII

Hamel sliced his ball at the ninth and after waiting for a few minutes
patiently Esther came to help him look for it He was standing down
on the sands a little apart from the two caddies who were beating out
various tufts of long grass

Where did it go she asked

I have no idea he admitted

Why dont you help look for it

Searching for balls he insisted is a caddys occupation Both the
caddies are now busy Let us sit down here These sand hummocks are
delightful It is perfectly sheltered and the sun is in our faces Golf
is an overrated pastime Let us sit and watch that little streak of blue
find its way up between the white posts

She hesitated for a moment

We shall lose our place

There is no one behind

She sank on to the little knoll of sand to which he had pointed with a
resigned sigh

You really are a queer person she declared You have been playing
golf this morning as though your very life depended upon it You have
scarcely missed a shot or spoken a word And now all of a sudden you
want to sit on a sand hummock and watch the tide

I have been silent he told her because I have been thinking

That may be truthful she remarked but you wouldnt call it polite
would you

The subject of my thoughts is my excuse I have been thinking of you

For a single moment her eyes seemed to have caught something of that
sympathetic light with which he was regarding her Then she looked away

Was it my mashie shots you were worrying about she asked

It was not he replied simply It was youyou yourself

She laughed not altogether naturally

How flattering she murmured Bytheby you are rather a downright
person arent you Mr Hamel

So much so he admitted that I am going to tell you one or two
things now I am going to be very frank indeed

She sat suddenly quite still Her face was turned from him but for the
first time since he had known her there was a slight undertone of colour
in her cheeks

A week ago he said I hadnt the faintest idea of coming into
Norfolk I knew about this little shanty of my fathers but I had
forgotten all about it I came as the result of a conversation I had
with a friend who is in the Foreign Office

She looked at him with startled eyes

What do you mean she asked quickly You are Mr Hamel arent you

Certainly he replied Not only am I Richard Hamel mining engineer
but I really have all that reading to do I have spoken about and I
really was looking for a quiet spot to do it in It is true that I had
this part of the world in my mind but I do not think that I should ever
have really decided to come here if it had not been for my friend in
London He was very interested indeed directly I mentioned St Davids
Tower Would you like to know what he told me

Yes Go on please

He told me a little of the history of your uncle Mr Fentolin and
what he did not tell me at the time he has since supplemented I
suppose he added hesitatingly that you yourself

Please go on Please speak as though I knew nothing

Well then Hamel continued he told me that your uncle was at one
time in the Foreign Office himself He seemed to have a most brilliant
career before him when suddenly there was a terrible scandal A
political secretI dont know what it washad leaked out There were
rumours that it had been acquired for a large sum of money by a foreign
Power Mr Fentolin retired to Norfolk pending an investigation It was
just as that time that he met with his terrible accident and the matter
was dropped

Go on please she murmured

My friend went on to say that during the last few years Mr Fentolin
has once again become an object of some suspicion to the head of our
Secret Service Department For a long time they have known that he was
employing agents abroad and that he was showing the liveliest interest
in underground politics They believed that it was a mere hobby born
of his useless condition a taste ministered to without doubt by
the occupation of his earlier life Once or twice lately they have had
reason to change their minds You know I dare say in what a terribly
disturbed state European affairs are just now Well my friend had an
idea that Mr Fentolin was showing an extraordinary amount of interest
in a certain conference which we understand is to take place at The
Hague He begged me to come down and to watch your uncle while I was
down here and report to him anything that seemed to me noteworthy
Since then I have had a message from him concerning the American whom
you entertainedMr John P Dunster It appears that he was the bearer
of very important dispatches for the Continent

But he has gone she said quickly Nothing happened to him after
all He went away without a word of complaint We all saw him

That is quite true Hamel admitted Mr Dunster has certainly gone
It is rather a coincidence however that he should have taken his
departure just as the enquiries concerning his whereabouts had reached
such a stage that it had become quite impossible to keep him concealed
any longer

She turned a little in her place and looked at him steadfastly

Mr Hamel she said tell mewhat of your mission You have had an
opportunity of studying my uncle You have even lived under his roof
Tell me what you think

His face was troubled

Miss Fentolin he said I will tell you frankly that up to now I have
not succeeded in solving the problem of your uncles character To me
personally he has been most courteous He lives apparently a
studious and an unselfish life I have heard him even spoken of as a
philanthropist And yet you threeyou your mother and your brother
who are nearest to him who live in his house and under his protection
have the air of passing your days in mortal fear of him

Mr Hamel she exclaimed nervously you dont believe that He is
always very kind

Apparently Hamel observed drily And yet you must remember that you
too are afraid of him I need not remind you of our conversations but
there the truth is You praise his virtues and his charities you pity
him and yet you go about with a load of fear andforgive meof
secret terror in your heart you and Gerald too As for your mother

Dont she interrupted suddenly Why do you bring me here to talk
like this You cannot alter things Nothing can be altered

Cant it he replied Well I will tell you the real reason of my
having brought you here and of my having made this confession I brought
you here because I could not bear to go on living if not under your
roof at any rate in the neighbourhood without telling you the truth
Now you know it I am here to watch Mr Fentolin I am going on watching
him You can put him on his guard if you like I shant complain Or
you can

He paused so long that she looked at him He moved a little closer to
her his fingers suddenly gripped her hand

Or you can marry me and come away from it all he concluded quietly
Forgive me pleaseI mean it

For a moment the startled light in her eyes was followed by a delicious
softness Her lips were parted she leaned a little towards him Then
suddenly she seemed to remember She rose with swift alertness to her
feet

I think she said that we had better play golf

But I have asked you to marry me he protested as he scrambled up

Your caddy has found your ball a long time ago she pointed out
walking swiftly on ahead

He played his shot and caught her up

Miss FentolinEsther he pleaded eagerly do you think that I am not
in earnest Because I am I mean it Even if I have only known you for a
few days it has been enough I think that I knew it was coming from the
moment that you stepped into my railway carriage

You knew that what was coming she asked raising her eyes suddenly

That I should care for you

Its the first time youve told me she reminded him with a queer
little smile Oh forgive me please I didnt mean to say that
I dont want to have you tell me so Its all too ridiculous and
impossible

Is it And why

I have only known you for three days

We can make up for that

But I dontcare about you I have never thought of any one in that
way It is absurd she went on

Youll have to sometime or other he declared Ill take you
travelling with me show you the world new worlds unnamed rivers
untrodden mountains Or do you want to go and see where the little brown
people live among the mimosa and the cherry blossoms Ill take you so
far away that this place and this life will seem like a dream

Her breath caught a little

Dont please she begged You know very wellor rather you dont
know perhaps but I must tell youthat I couldnt I am here tied and
bound and I cant escape

Ah dear dont believe it he went on earnestly There isnt any
bond so strong that I wont break it for you no knot I wont untie if
you give me the right

They were climbing slowly on to the tee He stepped forward and pulled
her up Her hand was cold Her eyes were raised to his very softly yet
almost pleadingly

Please dont say anything more she begged I cantquite bear it
just now You know you must rememberthere is my mother Do you think
that I could leave her to struggle alone

His caddy who had teed the ball and who had regarded the proceedings
with a moderately tolerant air felt called upon at last to interfere

Wed best get on he remarked pointing to two figures in the
distance or theyll say weve cut in

Hamel smote his ball far and true On a more moderate scale she followed
his example They descended the steps together

Lovemaking isnt going to spoil our golf he whispered smiling as
he touched her fingers once more

She looked at him almost shyly

Is this lovemaking she asked

They walked together from the eighteenth green towards the clubhouse
A curious silence seemed suddenly to have enveloped them Hamel was
conscious of a strange exhilaration a queer upheaval of ideas an
excitement which nothing in his previous life had yet been able to yield
him The wonder of it amazed him kept him silent It was not until they
reached the steps indeed that he spoke

On our way home he began

She seemed suddenly to have stiffened He looked at her surprised She
was standing quite still her hand gripping the post her eyes fixed
upon the waiting motorcar The delicate softness had gone from
her face Once more that look of partly veiled suffering was there
suffering mingled with fear

Look she whispered under her breath Look It is Mr Fentolin He
has come for us himself he is there in the car

Mr Fentolin a strange little figure lying back among the cushions of
the great Daimler raised his hat and waved it to them

Come along children he cried You see I am here to fetch you
myself The sunshine has tempted me What a heavenly morning Come and
sit by my side Esther and fight your battle all over again That is
one of the joys of golf isnt it he asked turning to Hamel You
need not be afraid of boring me Today is one of my bright days I
suppose that it is the sunshine and the warm wind On the way here we
passed some fields I could swear that I smelt violets Where are you
going Esther

To take my clubs to my locker and pay my caddy she replied

Mr Hamel will do that for you Mr Fentolin declared Come and
take your seat by my side and let us wait for him I am tired of being
alone

She gave up her clubs reluctantly All the life seemed to have gone from
her face

Why didnt mother come with you she asked simply

To tell you the truth dear Esther he answered when I started I
had a fancy to be alone I thinkin fact I am surethat your mother
wanted to come The sunshine too was tempting her Perhaps it was
selfish of me not to bring her but then there is a great deal to be
forgiven me isnt there Esther

A great deal she echoed looking steadily ahead of her

I came he went on because it occurred to me that after all I
had my duties as your guardian dear Esther I am not sure that we can
permit flirtations you know Let me see how old are you

Twentyone she replied

In a magazine I was reading the other day he continued I was
interested to observe that the modern idea as regards marriage is
a changed one A woman they say should not marry until she is
twentyseven or twentyeighta very excellent idea I think we agree
do we not on that Esther

I dont know she replied I have never thought about the matter

Then he went on we will make up our minds to agree Twentyseven or
twentyeight let us say A very excellent age A girl should know
her own mind by then And meanwhile dear Esther would it be wise
I wonder to see a little less of our friend Mr Hamel He leaves us
today I think He is very obstinate about that If he were staying
still in the house well it might be different But if he persists in
leaving us you will not forget dear that association with a guest
is one thing association with a young man living out of the house is
another A great deal less of Mr Hamel I think that we must see

She made no reply whatever Hamel was coming now towards them

Really a very personable young man Mr Fentolin remarked studying
him through his eyeglass Is it my fancy I wonder as an observant
person or is he just a littlejust a little taken with you Esther A
pity if it is soa great pity

She said nothing but her hand which rested upon the rug was trembling a
little

If you have an opportunity Mr Fentolin suggested dropping his
voice you might very delicately you knowgirls are so clever at that
sort of thingconvey my views to Mr Hamel as regards his leaving us and
its effect upon your companionship You understand me I am sure

For the first time she turned her head towards him

I understand she said that you have some particular reason for not
wishing Mr Hamel to leave St Davids Hall

He smiled benignly

You do my hospitable impulses full justice dear Esther he declared
Sometimes I think that you understand me almost as well as your dear
mother If by any chance Mr Hamel should change his mind as to taking
up his residence at the Tower I think you would not find me in any
sense of the word an obdurate or exacting guardian Come along Mr
Hamel That seat opposite to us is quite comfortable You see I resign
myself to the inevitable I have come to fetch golfers home to luncheon
and I compose myself to listen Which of you will begin the epic of
missed putts and brassey shots which failed by a foot to carry




CHAPTER XXIV

Hamel sat alone upon the terrace his afternoon coffee on a small table
in front of him His eyes were fixed upon a black speck at the end of
the level roadway which led to the Tower Only a few minutes before Mr
Fentolin in his little carriage had shot out from the passage beneath
the terrace on his way to the Tower Behind him came Meekins bending
over his bicycle Hamel watched them both with thoughtful eyes There
were several little incidents in connection with their expedition which
he scarcely understood

Then there came at last the sound for which he had been listening the
rustle of a skirt along the terraced way Hamel turned quickly around
half rising to his feet and concealing his disappointment with
difficulty It was Mrs Seymour Fentolin who stood there a little dog
under each arm a large hat gay with flowers upon her head She wore
patent shoes with high heels and white silk stockings She had indeed
the air of being dressed for luncheon at a fashionable restaurant As
she stooped to set the dogs down a strong waft of perfume was shaken
from her clothes

Are you entirely deserted Mr Hamel she asked

I am he replied Miss Esther went I think to look for you My
host he added pointing to the black speck in the distance begged me
to defer my occupation of the Tower for an hour or so and has gone down
there to collect some of his trifles

Her eyes followed his outstretched hand She seemed to him to shiver for
a moment

You really mean then that you are going to leave us she asked
accepting the chair which he had drawn up close to his

He smiled

Well I scarcely came on a visit to St Davids Hall did I he
reminded her It has been delightfully hospitable of Mr Fentolin to
have insisted upon my staying on here for these few days but I could
not possibly inflict myself upon you all for an unlimited period

Mrs Fentolin sat quite still for a time In absolute repose if
one could forget her mass of unnaturally golden hair the forced and
constant smile the too liberal use of rouge and powder the nervous
motions of her head it was easily to be realised that there were still
neglected attractions about her face and figure Only in these moments
of repose an intense and ageing weariness seemed to have crept into her
eyes and face It was as though she had dropped the mask of incessant
gaiety and permitted a glimpse of her real self to steal to the surface

Mr Hamel she said quietly I dare say that even during these few
days you have realised that Mr Fentolin is a very peculiar man

I have certainly observedeccentricities Hamel assented

My life and the lives of my two children she went on is devoted to
the task of ministering to his happiness

Isnt that rather a heavy sacrifice he asked Mrs Seymour Fentolin
looked down the long narrow way along which Mr Fentolin had passed
He was out of sight now inside the Tower Somehow or other the thought
seemed to give her courage and dignity She spoke differently without
nervousness or hurry

To you Mr Hamel she said it may seem so We who make it know of
its necessity

He bowed his head It was not a subject for him to discuss with her

Mr Fentolin has whims she went on violent whims We all try to
humour him He has his own ideas about Geralds bringing up I do not
agree with them but we submit Esther too suffers perhaps to a
less extent As for meher voice broke a littleMr Fentolin likes
people around him who are always cheerful He prefers even a certain
styleof dress I too have to do my little share

Hamels face grew darker

Has it ever occurred to you he demanded that Mr Fentolin is a
tyrant

She closed her eyes for a moment

There are reasons she declared why I cannot discuss that with you
He has these strong fancies and it is our task in life to humour them
He has one now with regard to the Tower with regard to you You are
of course your own master You can do as you choose and you will do
as you choose Neither I nor my children have any claim upon your
consideration But Mr Hamel you have been so kind that I feel moved
to tell you this It would make it very much easier for all of us if you
would give up this scheme of yours if you would stay on here instead of
going to reside at the Tower

Hamel threw away his cigarette He was deeply interested

Mrs Fentolin he said I am glad to have you speak so plainly Let
me answer you in the same spirit I am leaving this house mainly because
I have conceived certain suspicions with regard to Mr Fentolin I do
not like him I do not trust him I do not believe in him Therefore
I mean to remove myself from the burden of his hospitality There are
reasons he went on why I do not wish to leave the neighbourhood
altogether There are certain investigations which I wish to make That
is why I have decided to go to the Tower

Miles was right then she cried suddenly You are here to spy upon
him

He turned towards her swiftly

To spy upon him Mrs Fentolin For what reason Why Is he a criminal
then

She opened her lips and closed them again There was a slight frown upon
her forehead It was obvious that the word had unintentionally escaped
her

I only know what it is that he called you what he suspects you of
being she explained Mr Fentolin is very clever and he is generally
at work upon something We do not enquire into the purpose of his
labours The only thing I know is that he suspects you of wanting to
steal one of his secrets

Secrets But what secrets has he Hamel demanded Is he an inventor

You ask me idle questions she sighed We have gone perhaps a
little further than I intended I came to plead with you for all our
sakes if I could to make things more comfortable by remaining here
instead of insisting upon your claim to the Tower

Mrs Fentolin Hamel said firmly I like to do what I can to please
and benefit my friends especially those who have been kind to me I
will be quite frank with you There is nothing you could ask me which I
would not do for your daughters sakeif I were convinced that it was
for her good

Mrs Seymour Fentolin seemed to be trembling a little Her hands were
crossed upon her bosom

You have known her for so short a time she murmured

Hamel smiled confidently

I will not weary you he said with the usual trite remarks I
will simply tell you that the time has been long enough I love your
daughter

Mrs Fentolin sat quite still Only in her eyes fixed steadily
seawards there was the light of something new as though some new
thought was stirring in her brain Her lips moved although the sound
which came was almost inaudible

Why not she murmured as though arguing with some unseen critic of
her thoughts Why not

I am not a rich man Hamel went on but I am fairly well off I could
afford to be married at once and I should like

She turned suddenly upon him and gripped his wrist

Listen she interrupted you are a traveller are you not You have
been to distant countries where white people go seldom inaccessible
countries where even the arm of the law seldom reaches Couldnt you
take her away there take her right away travel so fast that nothing
could catch you and hidehide for a little time

Hamel stared at his companion for a moment blankly Her attitude was
so unexpected her questioning so fierce

My dear Mrs Fentolin he began

She suddenly relaxed her grip of his arm Something of the old
hopelessness was settling down upon her face Her hands fell into her
lap

No she interrupted I forgot I mustnt talk like that She too is
part of the sacrifice

Part of the sacrifice Hamel repeated frowning Is she indeed I
dont know what sacrifice you mean but Esther is the girl whom sooner
or later somehow or other I am going to make my wife and when she is
my wife I shall see to it that she isnt afraid of Miles Fentolin or of
any other man breathing

A gleam of hopefulness shone through the stony misery of the womans
face

Does Esther care she asked softly

How can I tell I can only hope so If she doesnt yet she shall some
day I suppose he added with a sigh it is rather too soon yet to
expect that she should If it is necessary I can wait

Mrs Fentolins eyes were once more fixed upon the Tower The sun had
caught the top of the telephone wire and played around it till it seemed
like a long thin shaft of silver

If you go down there she said Esther will not be allowed to see you
at all Mr Fentolin has decided to take it as a personal affront You
will be ostracised from here

Shall I he answered Well it wont be for long at any rate And
as to not seeing Esther you must remember that I come from outside
this little domain and I see nothing more in Mr Fentolin than a
badtempered mischievous tyrannical old invalid who is fortunately
prevented by his infirmities from doing as much mischief as he might
I am not afraid of your brotherinlaw or of the bully he takes about
with him and I am going to see your daughter somehow or other and I am
going to marry her before very long

She thrust out her hand suddenly and grasped his The fingers were very
thin almost bony and covered with rings Their grip was feverish and
he felt them tremble

You are a brave man Mr Hamel she declared speaking in a low quick
undertone Perhaps you are right The shadow isnt over your head You
havent lived in the terror of it You may find a way God grant it

She wrung his fingers and rose to her feet Her voice suddenly changed
into another key Hamel knew instinctively that she wished him to
understand that their conversation was over

ChowChow she cried come along dear we must have our walk Come
along Koto come along little dogs

Hamel strolled down the terrace steps and wandered for a time in the
gardens behind the house Here in the shelter of the great building he
found himself suddenly in an atmosphere of springtime There were
beds of crocuses and hyacinths fragrant clumps of violets borders of
snowdrops masses of primroses and early anemones He slowly climbed one
or two steep paths until he reached a sort of plateau level with the
top of the house The flowers here grew more sparsely the track of the
salt wind lay like a withering band across the flowerbeds The garden
below was like a little oasis of colour and perfume Arrived at the
bordering red brick wall he turned around and looked along the narrow
road which led to the sea There was no sign of Mr Fentolins return
Then to his left he saw a gate open and heard the clamour of dogs
Esther appeared walking swiftly towards the little stretch of road
which led to the village He hurried after her

Unsociable person he exclaimed as he caught her up Didnt you know
that I was longing for a walk

How should I read your thoughts she answered Besides a few minutes
ago I saw you on the terrace talking to mother I am only going as far
as the village

May I come he asked I have business there myself

She laughed

There are nine cottages three farmhouses and a general shop in St
Davids she remarked Also about fifteen fishermens cottages dotted
about the marsh Your business I presume is with the general shop

He shook his head falling into step with her

What I want he explained is to find a woman to come in and look
after me at the Tower Your servant who valets me has given me two
names

Something of the lightness faded from her face

So you have quite made up your mind to leave us she asked slowly
Mother wasnt able to persuade you to stay

He shook his head

She was very kind he said but there are really grave reasons why
I feel that I must not accept Mr Fentolins hospitality any longer I
had he went on a very interesting talk with your mother

She turned quickly towards him The slightest possible tinge of
additional colour was in her cheeks She was walking on the top of a
green bank with the wind blowing her skirts around her The turn of
her head was a little diffident almost shy Her eyes were asking him
questions At that moment she seemed to him with her slim body her
gently parted lips and soft tremulous eyes almost like a child He
drew a little nearer to her

I told your mother he continued all that I have told you and
more I told her dear that I cared for you that I wanted you to be my
wife

She was caught in a little gust of wind Both her hands went up to her
hat her face was hidden She stepped down from the bank

You shouldnt have done that she said quietly

Why not he demanded It was the truth

He stooped forward intent upon looking into her face The mystic
softness was still in her eyes but her general expression was
inscrutable It seemed to him that there was fear there

What did mother say she whispered

Nothing discouraging he replied I dont think she minded at all I
have decided if you give me permission to go and talk to Mr Fentolin
this evening

She shook her head very emphatically

Dont she implored Dont Dont give him another whip to lash us
with Keep silent Let me just have the memory for a few days all to
myself

Her words came to him like numb things There was little expression in
them and yet he felt that somehow they meant so much

Esther dear he said I shall do just as you ask me At the same
time please listen I think that you are all absurdly frightened of
Mr Fentolin Living here alone with him you have all grown under his
dominance to an unreasonable extent Because of his horrible infirmity
you have let yourselves become his slaves There are limits to this sort
of thing Esther I come here as a stranger and I see nothing more in
Mr Fentolin than a very selfish irritable domineering and capricious
old man Humour him by all means I am willing to do the same myself
But when it comes to the great things in life neither he nor any living
person is going to keep from me the woman I love

She walked by his side in silence Her breath was coming a little
quicker her fingers lay passive in his Then for a moment he felt the
grip of them almost burn into his flesh Still she said nothing

I want your permission dear he went on to go to him I suppose he
calls himself your guardian If he says no you are of age I just want
you to believe that I am strong enough to put my arms around you and to
carry you away to my own world and keep you there although an army of
Mr Fentolins creatures followed us

She turned and he saw the great transformation Her face was brilliant
her eyes shone with wonderful things

Please she begged will you say or do nothing at all for a little
time until I tell you when I want just a few days peace You have
said such beautiful things to me that I want them to lie there in my
thoughts in my heart undisturbed for just a little time You see we
are at the village now I am going to call at this third cottage While
I am inside you can go and make what enquiries you like Come and knock
at the door for me when you are ready

And we will walk back together

We will walk back together she promised him

I will take you home another way I will take you over what they call
the Common and come down behind the Hall into the gardens

She dismissed him with a little smile He strolled along the village
street and plunged into the mysterious recesses of the one tiny shop



CHAPTER XXV

Hamel met Kinsley shortly before one oclock the following afternoon in
the lounge of the Royal Hotel at Norwich

You got my wire then the latter asked as he held out his hand I
had it sent by special messenger from Wells

It arrived directly after breakfast Hamel replied It wasnt the
easiest matter to get here even then for there are only about two
trains a day and I didnt want to borrow a car from Mr Fentolin

Quite right Kinsley agreed I wanted you to come absolutely on your
own Lets get into the coffeeroom and have some lunch now I want to
catch the afternoon train back to town

Do you mean to say that youve come all the way down here to talk to me
for half an hour or so Hamel demanded as they took their places at a
table

All the way from town Kinsley assented and up to the eyes in work
we are too Dick what do you think of Miles Fentolin

Hanged if I know Hamel answered with a sigh

Nothing definite to tell us then

Nothing

What about Mr John P Dunster

He left yesterday morning Hamel said I saw him go He looked very
shaky I understood that Mr Fentolin sent him to Yarmouth

Did Mr Fentolin know that there was an enquiry on foot about this
mans disappearance Kinsley asked

Certainly I heard Lord Saxthorpe tell him that the police had received
orders to scour the country for him and that they were coming to St
Davids Hall

Kinsley for a moment was singularly and eloquently profane

Thats why Mr Fentolin let him go then If Saxthorpe had only held
his tongue or if those infernal police hadnt got chattering with the
magistrates we might have made a coup As it is the games up Mr
Dunster left for Yarmouth you say yesterday morning

I saw him go myself He looked very shaky and ill but he was able to
smoke a big cigar and walk downstairs leaning on the doctors arm

I dont doubt Kinsley remarked but that you saw what you say you
saw At the same time you may be surprised to hear that Mr Dunster has
disappeared again

Disappeared again Hamel muttered

It looks very much Kinsley continued as though your friend Miles
Fentolin has been playing with him like a cat with a mouse He has
been obliged to turn him out of one hidingplace and he has simply
transferred him to another

Hamel looked doubtful

Mr Dunster left quite alone in the car he said He was on his guard
too for Mr Fentolin and he had had words I really cant see how it
was possible for him to have got into any more trouble

Where is he then Kinsley demanded Come I will let you a little
further into our confidence We have reason to believe that he carries
with him a written message which is practically the only chance we have
of avoiding disaster during the next few days That written message is
addressed to the delegates at The Hague who are now sitting Nothing
had been heard of Dunster or the document he carries No word has come
from him of any sort since he left St Davids Hall

Have you tried to trace him from there Hamel asked

Trace him Kinsley repeated By heavens you dont seem to
understand Dick the immense the extraordinary importance of this man
to us The cleverest detective in England spent yesterday under your
nose at St Davids Hall There are a dozen others working upon the job
as hard as they can All the reports confirm what you saythat Dunster
left St Davids Hall at halfpast nine yesterday morning and he
certainly arrived in Yarmouth at a little before twelve From there he
seems however to have completely disappeared The car went back to
St Davids Hall empty the man only stayed long enough in Yarmouth in
fact to have his dinner We cannot find a single smack owner who
was approached in any way for the hire of a boat Yarmouth has been
ransacked in vain He certainly has not arrived at The Hague or we
should have heard news at once As a last resource I ran down here to
see you on the chance of your having picked up any information

Hamel shook his head

You seem to know a good deal more than I do already he said

What do you think of Mr Fentolin You have stayed in his house You
have had an opportunity of studying him

So far as my impressions go Hamel replied everything which you have
suggested might very well be true I think that either out of sheer love
of mischief or from some subtler motive he is capable of anything
Every one in the place except one poor woman seems to look upon him
as a sort of supernatural being He gives money away to worthless people
with both hands Yet I share your opinion of him I believe that he is
a creature without conscience or morals I have sat at his table and
shivered when he has smiled

Are you staying at St Davids Hall now

I left yesterday

Where are you now then

I am at St Davids Towerthe little place I told you of that belonged
to my fatherbut I dont know whether I shall be able to stop there
Mr Fentolin for some reason or other very much resented my leaving
the Hall and was very annoyed at my insisting upon claiming the Tower
When I went down to the village to get some one to come up and look
after me there wasnt a woman there who would come It didnt matter
what I offered they were all the same They all muttered some excuse or
other and seemed only anxious to show me out At the village shop they
seemed to hate to serve me with anything It was all I could do to get a
packet of tobacco yesterday afternoon You would really think that I was
the most unpopular person who ever lived and it can only be because of
Mr Fentolins influence

Mr Fentolin evidently doesnt like to have you in the locality
Kinsley remarked thoughtfully

He was all right so long as I was at St Davids Hall Hamel observed

Whats this little place likeSt Davids Tower you call it Kinsley
asked

Just a little stone building actually on the beach Hamel explained
There is a large shed which Mr Fentolin keeps locked up and the
habitable portion consists just of a bedroom and sittingroom From what
I can see Mr Fentolin has been making a sort of hobby of the place
There is telephonic communication with the house and he seems to have
used the sittingroom as a sort of studio He paints sea pictures and
really paints them very well

A man came into the coffeeroom made some enquiry of the waiter and
went out again Hamel stared at him in a puzzled manner For the moment
he could only remember that the face was familiar Then he suddenly gave
vent to a little exclamation

Any one would think that I had been followed he remarked The man
who has just looked into the room is one of Mr Fentolins parasites or
bodyguards or whatever you call them

You probably have Kinsley agreed What post does he hold in the
household

I have no idea Hamel replied I saw him the first day I arrived and
not since Sort of secretary I should think

He is a queerlooking fellow anyway Kinsley muttered Look out
Dick Here he comes back again

Mr Ryan approached the table a little diffidently

I hope you will forgive the liberty sir he said to Hamel You
remember me I trustMr Ryan I am the librarian at St Davids Hall

Hamel nodded

I thought Id seen you there

I was wondering the man continued whether you had a car of Mr
Fentolins in Norwich today and if so whether I might beg a seat
back in case you were returning before the five oclock train I came
in early this morning to go through some manuscripts at a secondhand
booksellers here and I have unfortunately missed the train back

Hamel shook his head

I came in by train myself or I would have given you a lift back with
pleasure he said

Mr Ryan expressed his thanks briefly and left the room Kinsley watched
him from over the top of a newspaper

So that is one of Mr Fentolins creatures too he remarked Keeping
his eye on you in Norwich eh Tell me Dick bytheby how do you get
on with the rest of Mr Fentolins household and exactly of whom does
it consist

There is his sisterinlaw Hamel replied Mrs Seymour Fentolin She
is a strange tiredlooking woman who seems to stand in mortal fear of
Mr Fentolin She is always overdressed and never natural but it seems
to me that nearly everything she does is done to suit his whims or at
his instigation

Kinsley nodded thoughtfully

I remember Seymour Fentolin he said a really fine fellow he was
Well who else

Just the nephew and niece The boy is half sullen half discontented
yet he too seems to obey his uncle blindly The three of them seem
to be his slaves Its a thing you cant live in the house without
noticing

It seems to be a cheerful sort of household Kinsley observed You
read the papers I suppose Dick he asked after a moments pause

On and off the last few days I seem to have been busy doing all sorts
of things

Well Ill tell you something Kinsley continued The whole of
our available fleet is engaged in carrying out what they call a
demonstration in the North Sea They have patrol boats out in every
direction and only the short distance wireless signals are being used
Everything of course is in code yet we know this for a fact a
good deal of private information passing between the Admiral and his
commanders was known in Germany three hours after the signals themselves
had been given It is suspectedmore than suspected in factthat
these messages were picked up by Mr Fentolins wireless installation

I dont suppose he could help receiving them Hamel remarked

He could help decoding them and sending them through to Germany
though Kinsley retorted grimly The worst of it is he has a private
telephone wire in his house to London If he isnt up to mischief
what does he need all these things forprivate telegraph line private
telephone private wireless We have given the postmaster a hint to have
the telegraph office moved down into the village but I dont know that
that will help us much

So far as regards the wireless Hamel said I rather believe that it
is temporarily dismantled We had a sailorman over the morning before
yesterday to complain of his messages having been picked up Mr
Fentolin promised at once to put his installation out of work for a
time

He has done plenty of mischief with it already Kinsley groaned
However it was Dunster I came down to make enquiries about I couldnt
help hoping that you might have been able to put us on the right track

Hamel sighed

I know nothing beyond what I have told you

How did he look when he went away

Very ill indeed Hamel declared I afterwards saw the nurse who had
been attending him and she admitted that he was not fit to travel I
should say the probabilities are that he is laid up again somewhere

Did you actually speak to him

Just a word or two

And you saw him go off in the car

Gerald Fentolin and I both saw him and wished him goodby

Kinsley glanced at the clock and rose to his feet Walk down to the
station with me he suggested I neednt tell you I am sure he went
on as they left the hotel a few minutes later that if anything does
turn up or if you get the glimmering of an idea youll let me know
Weve a small army looking for the fellow but it does seem as though he
had disappeared off the face of the earth If he doesnt turn up before
the end of the Conference we are done

Tell me Hamel asked after they had walked for some distance in
silence exactly why is our fleet demonstrating to such an extent

That Conference I have spoken of Kinsley replied which is being
held at The Hague is being held we know purposely to discuss certain
matters in which we are interested It is meeting for their discussion
without any invitation having been sent to this country There is only
one reply possible to such a course It is there in the North Sea But
unfortunately

Kinsley paused His tone and his expression had alike become gloomier

Go on Hamel begged

Our reply after all is a miserable affair Kinsley concluded You
remember the outcry over the withdrawal of our Mediterranean Fleet Now
you see its sequel We havent a ship worth a snap of the fingers from
Gibraltar to Suez If France deserts us its goodby to Malta goodby
to Egypt goodby to India Its the disruption of the British Empire
And all this he wound up as he paused before taking his seat in the
railway carriage all this might even now be avoided if only we could
lay our hands upon the message which that man Dunster was bringing from
New York




CHAPTER XXVI

Once more Hamel descended from the little train and turning away
from St Davids Hall made his way across the marshes seawards The
sunshine of the last few days had departed The twilight was made gloomy
by a floating veil of white mist which hung about in wet patches
Hamel turned up his coat collar as he walked and shivered a little The
thought of his solitary night and uncomfortable surroundings after
all the luxury of St Davids Hall was scarcely inspiring Yet on
the whole he was splendidly cheerful The glamour of a host of new
sensations was upon him There was a new love of living in his heart
He forgot the cold east wind which blew in his face bringing with it
little puffs of damp grey mist He forgot the cheerlessness which he was
about to face the lonely night before him For the first time in his
life a woman reigned in his thoughts

It was not until he actually reached the very side of the Tower that he
came back to earth As he opened the door he found a surprise in store
for him A fire was burning in the sittingroom smoke was ascending
from the kitchen chimney The little round table was laid with a white
cloth There was a faint odour of cooking from the back premises His
lamp was lit there were logs hissing and crackling upon the fire As
he stood there looking wonderingly about him the door from the back was
opened Hannah Cox came quietly into the room

What time would you like your dinner sir she enquired

Hamel stared at her

Why are you going to keep house for me Mrs Cox he asked

If you please sir I heard that you had been in the village looking
for some one I am sorry that I was away There is no one else who would
come to you

So I discovered he remarked a little grimly

No one else she went on would come to you because of Mr Fentolin
He does not wish to have you here They love him so much in the village
that he had only to breathe the word It was enough

Yet you are here he reminded her

I do not count she answered I am outside all these things

Hamel gave a little sigh of satisfaction

Well I am glad you could come anyhow If you have something for
dinner I should like it in about half an hour

He climbed the narrow stairs which led to his bedroom To his surprise
there were many things there for his comfort which he had forgotten to
orderclean bedlinen towels even a curtain upon the window

Where did you get all the linen upstairs from Mrs Cox he asked
her when he descended The room was almost empty yesterday and I
forgot nearly all the things I meant to bring home from Norwich

Mrs Seymour Fentolin sent down a hamper for you the woman replied
with a message from Mr Fentolin He said that nothing among the
oddments left by your father had been preserved but that you were
welcome to anything you desired if you would let them know at the
Hall

It is very kind of both of them Hamel said thoughtfully

The woman stood still for a moment looking at him Then she drew a step
nearer

Has Mr Fentolin given you the key of the shed she asked very
quietly

Hamel shook his head

We dont need the place do we

He did not give you the key she persisted

Mr Fentolin said that he had some things in there which he wished to
keep locked up he explained

She remained thoughtful for several moments Then she turned away

No she said it was not likely he would not give you that key

Hamel dined simply but comfortably Mrs Cox cleared away the things
brought him his coffee and appeared a few minutes later her shawl
wrapped around her ready for departure

I shall be here at seven oclock in the morning sir she announced

Hamel was a little startled He withdrew the pip from his mouth and
looked at her

Why of course he remarked Id forgotten There is no place for you
to stay here

I shall go back to my brothers she said

Hamel put some money upon the table

Please get anything that is necessary he directed I shall leave you
to do the housekeeping for a few days

Shall you be staying here long sir she asked

I am not sure he replied

I do not suppose she said that you will stay for very long I shall
get only the things that you require from day to day Good night sir

She left the room Hamel looked after her for a moment with a frown In
some indescribable way the woman half impressed half irritated him
She had always the air of keeping something in the background He
followed her out on to the little ridge of beach a few minutes after
she had left The mist was still drifting about Only a few yards away
the sea rolled in filling the air with dull thunder The marshland was
half obscured St Davids Hall was invisible but like strangelyhung
lanterns in an empty space he saw the line of lights from the great
house gleam through the obscurity There was no sound save the sound of
the sea He shivered slightly It was like an empty land this

Then moved by some instinct of curiosity he made his way round to
the closed door of the boathouse only to find it as he had expected
locked He shook it slightly without result Then he strolled round
to the back entered his own little abode by the kitchen and tried the
other door which led into the boathouse It was not only locked but
a staple had been put in and it was fastened with a padlock of curious
design which he did not remember to have seen there before Again half
unconsciously he listened and again he found the silence oppressive
He went back to his room brought out some of the books which it had
been his intention to study and sat and read over the fire

At ten oclock he went to bed As he threw open his window before
undressing it seemed to him that he could catch the sound of voices
from the sea He listened intently A grey pall hung everywhere To
the left with strange indistinctness almost like something human
struggling to assert itself came the fitful flash from the light at
the entrance to the tidal way Once more he strained his ears This time
there was no doubt about it He heard the sound of fishermens voices
He heard one of them say distinctly

Hard aport Dave lad Thats Fentolins light Keep her out a bit
Steady lad

Through a rift in the mist he caught a glimpse of the brown sail of a
fishingboat dangerously near the land He watched it alter its course
slightly and pass on Then again there was silence He undressed slowly
and went to bed

Later on he woke with a start and sat up in bed listening intently
listening for he knew not what Except for the backward scream of
the pebbles dragged down every few seconds by the receding waves an
unbroken silence seemed to prevail He struck a match and looked at his
watch It was exactly three oclock He got out of bed He was a man
in perfect health ignorant of the meaning of nerves a man of proved
courage Yet he was conscious that his pulses were beating with absurd
rapidity A new feeling seemed to possess him He could almost have
declared that he was afraid What sound had awakened him He had no
idea yet he seemed to have a distinct and absolute conviction that
it had been a real sound and no dream He drew aside the curtains and
looked out of the window The mist now seemed to have become almost a
fog to have closed in upon sea and land There was nothing whatever
to be seen As he stood there for a moment listening his face became
moist with the drifting vapour Suddenly upon the beach he saw what at
first he imagined must be an optical illusiona long shaft of light
invisible in itself except that it seemed to slightly change the density
of the mist He threw on an overcoat over his pyjamas thrust on his
slippers and taking up his own electric torch hastily descended the
stairs He opened the front door and stepped out on to the beach He
stood in the very place where the light had seemed to be and looked
inland There was no sign of any human person not a sound except the
falling of the sea upon the pebbly beach He raised his voice and called
out Somehow or other speech seemed to be a relief

Hullo

There was no response He tried again

Is any one there

Still no answer He watched the veiled light from the harbour appear and
disappear It threw no shadow of illumination upon the spot to which
he had gazed from his window One window at St Davids Hall was
illuminated The rest of the place was wrapped now in darkness He
walked up to the boathouse The door was still locked There was no
sign that any one had been there Reluctantly at last he reentered the
Tower and made his way upstairs

Confound that fellow Kinsley he muttered as he threw off his
overcoat All his silly suggestions and melodramatic ideas have given
me a fit of nerves I am going to bed and I am going to sleep That
couldnt have been a light I saw at all I couldnt have heard anything
I am going to sleep




CHAPTER XXVII

Hamel awoke to find his room filled with sunshine and a soft wind
blowing in through the open window There was a pleasant odour of coffee
floating up from the kitchen He looked at his watchit was past eight
oclock The sea was glittering and bespangled with sunlight He
found among his scanty belongings a bathing suit and wrapped in his
overcoat hurried downstairs

Breakfast in half an hour Mrs Cox he called out

She stood at the door watching him as he stepped across the pebbles and
plunged in For a few moments he swam Then he turned over on his back
The sunlight was gleaming from every window of St Davids Hall He even
fancied that upon the terrace he could see a whiteclad figure looking
towards him He turned over and swam once more From her place in the
doorway Mrs Cox called out to him

Mind the Dagger Rocks sir

He waved his hand The splendid exhilaration of the salt water seemed to
give him unlimited courage He dived but the womans cry of fear soon
recalled him Presently he swam to shore and hurried up the beach Mrs
Cox with a sigh of relief disappeared into the kitchen

Those rocks on your nerves again Mrs Cox he asked goodhumouredly
as he took his place at the breakfast table a quarter of an hour later

Its only us who live here sir she answered who know how terrible
they are Theres oneit comes up like my handa long spike A boat
once struck upon that and its as though itd been sawn through the
middle

I must have a look at them some day he declared I am going to work
this morning Mrs Cox Lunch at one oclock

He took rugs and established himself with a pile of books at the back
of a grassy knoll sheltered from the wind with the sea almost at his
feet He sharpened his pencil and numbered the page of his notebook
Then he looked up towards the Hall garden and found himself dreaming
The sunshine was delicious and a gentle optimism seemed to steal over
him

I am a fool he murmured to himself I am catching some part of these
peoples folly Mr Fentolin is only an ordinary crotchety invalid with
queer tastes On the big things he is probably like other men I shall
go to him this morning

A seagull screamed over his head Little brown sailed fishingboats
came gliding down the harbourway A pleasant sensuous joyfulness seemed
part of the spirit of the day Hamel stretched himself out upon the dry
sand

Work be hanged he exclaimed

A soft voice answered him almost in his ear a voice which was becoming
very familiar

A most admirable sentiment my young friend which you seem to be doing
your best to live up to Not a line written I see

He sat up upon his rug Mr Fentolin in his little carriage was there
by his side Behind was the faithful Meekins with an easel under his
arm

I trust that your first night in your new abode has been a pleasant
one Mr Fentolin asked

I slept quite well thanks Hamel replied Glad to see youre going
to paint

Mr Fentolin shook his head gloomily

It is alas he declared one of my weaknesses I can work only in
solitude I came down on the chance that the fine weather might have
tempted you over to the Golf Club As it is I shall return

I am awfully sorry Hamel said Cant I go out of sight somewhere

Mr Fentolin sighed

I will not ask your pardon for my absurd humours he continued a
little sadly Their existence however I cannot deny I will wait

It seems a pity for you to do that Hamel remarked You see I might
stay here for some time

Mr Fentolins face darkened He looked at the young man with a sort of
pensive wrath

If the latter went on you say yes to something I am going to ask
you I might even stayin the neighbourhoodfor longer still

Mr Fentolin sat quite motionless in his chair his eyes were fixed upon
Hamel

What is it that you are going to ask me he demanded

I want to marry your niece

Mr Fentolin looked at the young man in mild surprise

A sudden decision on your part Mr Hamel he murmured

Not at all Hamel assured him I have been ten years looking for
her

And the young lady Mr Fentolin enquired What does she say

I believe sir Hamel replied that she would be willing

Mr Fentolin sighed

One is forced sometimes he remarked regretfully to realise the
selfishness of our young people For many years one devotes oneself to
providing them with all the comforts and luxuries of life Then in a
single day they turn around and give everything they have to give to a
stranger So you want to marry Esther

If you please

She has a very moderate fortune

She need have none at all Hamel replied I have enough

Mr Fentolin glanced towards the house

Then he said I think you had better go and tell her so in which
case I shall be able to paint

I have your permission then Hamel asked rising to his feet eagerly

Negatively Mr Fentolin agreed you have I cannot refuse Esther is
of age the thing is reasonable I do not know whether she will be happy
with you or not A young man of your disposition who declines to study
the whims of an unfortunate creature like myself is scarcely likely to
be possessed of much sensibility However perhaps your views as to a
solitary residence here will change with your engagement to my niece

Hamel did not reply for a moment He was trying to ask himself why
even in the midst of this rush of anticipatory happiness he should be
conscious of a certain reluctance to leave the Towerand Mr Fentolin
He was looking longingly towards the Hall Mr Fentolin waved him away

Go and make love he ordered and leave me alone We are both in
pursuit of beautyonly our methods differ

Hamel hesitated no longer but walked up the narrow path with swift
buoyant footsteps Everywhere he seemed to be surrounded by the glorious
spring sunshine It glittered in the little pools and creeks by his
side It drew a new colour from the duncoloured marshes the masses
of emerald seaweed the shimmering sands It flashed in the long row of
windows of the Hall As he drew nearer he could see the banks of yellow
crocuses in the sloping gardens behind There were odours of spring in
the air He ran lightly up the terrace steps There was an easychair
drawn into her favourite corner and a book upon the table but no sign
of Esther He hesitated for a moment and then retracing his steps
along the terrace entered the house by the front door which stood wide
open There was no one in the hall scarcely a sound about the place A
great clock ticked solemnly from the foot of the stairs There was not
even a servant in sight Hamel wandered around at a loss what to do
He opened the door of the drawingroom and looked in It was empty
He turned away meaning to ring a bell On his way across the hall he
paused A curiously suggestive sound reached him faintly from the end of
one of the passages It was the click of a typewriter

Hamel stood for a moment perfectly still He had hurried up to the Hall
filled with the one selfish joy common to all mankind He had had no
thought save the thought of seeing Esther The click of that machine
brought him back to the stern realities of life He remembered his talk
to Kinsley his promise On the hall table he could see from where he
was standing the great headlines which announced the nations anxiety
He was in the house of a suspected spy The click of the typewriter
was an accompaniment to his thought He looked around once more and
listened Then he made his way quietly across the hall and down the
long passage at the end of which the room which Mr Fentolin called
his workroom was situated He turned the handle of the door and entered
closing it immediately behind him The woman who was typing paused with
her fingers upon the keys Her eyes met his coldly without curiosity
She had paused in her work but she took no other notice of his coming

Has Mr Fentolin sent you here she asked at last

He came over to the typewriter

Mr Fentolin has not sent me he said slowly I am here on my own
account I dare say you will think that I am a lunatic to come to you
like this Nevertheless please listen to me

Her fingers left the keys She laid her hands upon the table in front of
her He drew a little nearer She covered over the sheets of paper
with which she was surrounded with a pad of blottingpaper He pointed
suddenly to them

Why do you do that he demanded What is there in your work that you
are afraid I might see

She answered him without hesitation

These are private papers of Mr Fentolins No one has any business to
see them No one has any business to enter this room Why are you here

I came to the Hall to find Miss Fentolin he replied I heard the
click of your typewriter I came to you I suppose I should say on
impulse

Her eyes rested upon his filled with a cold and questioning light

Theres an impression up in London Hamel went on that Mr Fentolin
has been interfering by means of his wireless in affairs which dont
concern him and giving away valuable information This man Dunsters
disappearance is as yet unexplained I feel myself justified in making
certain investigations and among the first of them I should like you
to tell me exactly the nature of the work for which Mr Fentolin finds a
secretary necessary

She glanced towards the bell He moved to the edge of the table as
though to intercept her

In any ordinary case he continued I would not ask you to betray
your employers confidence As things are I think I am justified You
are English are you not You realise I suppose that the country is on
the brink of war

She looked at him from the depths of her still lusterless eyes

You must be a very foolish person she remarked if you expect to
obtain information in this manner

Perhaps I am he confessed but my folly has brought me to you and
you can give me the information if you will

Where is Mr Fentolin she asked

Down at the Tower he replied I left him there He sent me up to see
Miss Fentolin I was looking for her when the click of your typewriter
reminded me of other things

She turned composedly back to her work

I think she said that you had better go and find Miss Fentolin

Dont talk nonsense You cant think I have risked giving myself away
to you for nothing I mean to search this room to read the papers which
you are typing

She glanced around her a little contemptuously

You are welcome she assured him Pray proceed

They exchanged the glances of duelists Her plain black frock was
buttoned up to her throat Her colourless face seemed set in exact and
expressionless lines Her eyes were like windows of glass He felt only
their scrutiny nothing of the reason for it or of the thoughts which
stirred behind in her brain There was nothing about her attitude which
seemed in any way threatening yet he had the feeling that in this
interview it was she who possessed the upper hand

You are a foolish person she said calmly You are so foolish that
you are not in all probability in the slightest degree dangerous
Believe me ours is an unequal duel There is a bell upon this table
which has apparently escaped your notice I sit with my finger upon the
buttonso I have only to press it and the servants will be here I
do not wish to press it I do not desire that you should be as you
certainly would be banished from this house

He was immensely puzzled She had not resented his strange intrusion
She had accepted it indeed with curious equanimity Her forefinger
lingered still over the little ivory knob of the bell attached to her
desk He shrugged his shoulders

You have the advantage of me he admitted a little curtly All the
same I think I could possess myself of those sheets of paper you know
before the bell was answered

Would it be wise I wonder then to ensure their safety she asked
coolly

Her finger pressed the bell He took a quick step forward She held out
her hand

Stop she ordered These sheets will tell you nothing which you do
not know already unless you are a fool Never mind the bell That is my
affair I am sending you away

He leaned a little towards her

It wouldnt be possible to bribe you I suppose

She shook her head

I wonder you havent tried that before No it would notnot with
money that is to say

Youll tell Mr Fentolin I presume he asked quickly

I have nothing to tell him she replied Nothing has happened
Richards she went on as a servant entered the room Mr Hamel is
looking for Miss Fentolin Will you see if you can find her

The mans expression was full of polite regret

Miss Fentolin went over to Legh Woods early this morning sir he
announced She is staying to lunch with Lady Saxthorpe

Hamel stood quite still for a moment Then he turned to the window In
the far distance he could catch a glimpse of the Tower Mr Fentolins
chair had disappeared from the walk

I am sorry he said I must have made a mistake I will hurry back

There were more questions which he was longing to ask but the cold
negativeness of her manner chilled him She sat with her fingers poised
over the keys waiting for his departure He turned and left the room




CHAPTER XXVIII

Mr Fentolin his carriage drawn up close to the beach was painting
steadily when Hamel stood once more by his side His eyes moved only
from the sea to the canvas He never turned his head

So your wooing has not prospered my young friend he remarked gently
I am sorry Is there anything I can do

Your niece has gone out to lunch Hamel replied shortly

Mr Fentolin stopped painting His face was full of concern as he looked
up at Hamel

My dear sir he exclaimed how can I apologise Of course she has
gone out to lunch She has gone out to Lady Saxthorpes I remember the
subject being discussed I myself in fact was the instigator of her
going I owe you a thousand apologies Mr Hamel Let me make what
amends are possible for your useless journey Dine with us tonight

You are very kind

A poor amends Mr Fentolin continued A morning like this was made
for lovers Sunshine and blue sky a salt breeze flavoured just a little
with that lavender and a stroll through my spring gardens where my
hyacinths are like a field of purple and gold a mantle of jewels upon
the brown earth Ah well Ones thoughts will wander to the beautiful
things of life There were once women who loved me Mr Hamel

Hamel looked doubtfully at the strange little figure in the chair Was
this genuine he wondered a voluntary outburst or was it some subtle
attempt to incite sympathy Mr Fentolin seemed almost to have read his
thought

It is not for the sake of your pity that I say this he continued
Mine is only the passing across the line which age as well as infirmity
makes inevitable No one in the world who lives to grow old and who has
loved and felt the fire of it in his veins can pass that line without
sorrow or look back without a pang I am among a great army Well
well I shall paint no more today he concluded abruptly

Where is your servant Hamel asked

Mr Fentolin glanced around him carelessly

He has wandered away out of sight He knows well how necessary solitude
is to me if once I take the brush between my fingerssolitude natural
and entire I mean If any one is within a dozen yards of me I know it
even though I cannot see them Meekins is wandering somewhere the other
side of the Tower

Shall I call him

On no account Mr Fentolin begged Presently he will appear
in plenty of time There is the morning to be passedbarely eleven
oclock I think now I shall sit in my chair and sink a little down
and dream of these beautiful lights these rolling foamflecked waves
these patches of blue and shifting green I can form them in my brain I
can make a picture there even though my fingers refuse to move You are
not an aesthete I think Mr Hamel The study of beauty does not mean
to you what it did to your father and my father and in a smaller way
to me

Perhaps not Hamel confessed I believe I feel these things
somewhere because they bring a queer sense of content with them I am
afraid though that my artistic perceptions are not so keen as some
mens

Mr Fentolin looked at him thoughtfully

It is the physical life in your veinstoo splendid to permit you
abstract pleasures Compensations again you seecompensations I
wonder what the law is that governs these things I have forgotten
sometimes he went on forgotten my own infirmities in the soft
intoxication of a wonderful seascape Only he went on his face a
little grey it is the physical in life which triumphs There are the
hungry hours which nothing will satisfy

His head sank his chin rested upon his chest He had all the appearance
now of a man who talks in bitter earnest Yet Hamel wondered He looked
towards the Tower there was no sign of Meekins The seagulls went
screaming above their heads Mr Fentolin never moved His eyes seemed
half closed It was only when Hamel rose to his feet that he looked
swiftly up

Stay with me I beg you Mr Hamel he said I am in one of the moods
when solitude even for a moment is dangerous Do you know what I have
sometimes thought to myself

He pointed to the planked way which led down the steep pebbly beach to
the sea

I have sometimes thought he went on that it would be glorious to
find a friend to stand by my side at the top of the planks just there
when the tide was high and to bid him loose my chair and to steer it
myself to steer it down the narrow path into the arms of the sea The
first touch of the salt waves the last touch of life Why not One
sleeps without fear

He lifted his head suddenly Meekins had appeared coming round from the
back of the Tower Instantly Mr Fentolins whole manner changed He sat
up in his chair

It is arranged then he said You dine with us tonight For the
other matters of which you have spoken well let them rest in the hands
of the gods You are not very kind to me I am not sure whether you
would make Esther a good husband I am not sure even that I like you
You take no pains to make yourself agreeable Considering that your
father was an artist you seem to me rather a dull and uninspired young
man But who can tell There may be things stirring beneath that torpid
brain of yours of which no other person knows save yourself

The concentrated gaze of Mr Fentolins keen eyes was hard to meet but
Hamel came out of the ordeal without flinching

At eight oclock Mr Fentolin he answered I can see that I must
try to earn your better opinion

Hamel read steadily for the remainder of the morning It was past one
oclock when he rose stiffly from his seat among the sand knolls and
strolling back to the Tower opened the door and entered The cloth was
laid for luncheon in the little sittingroom but there were no signs
of Hannah Cox He passed on into the kitchen and came to a sudden
standstill Once more the memory of his own work passed away from him
Once more he was back again among that queer clouded tangle of strange
suspicions of thrilling halfformed fears which had assailed him at
times ever since his arrival at St Davids He stopped quite short
The words which rose to his lips died away He felt the breathless
compelling need for silence and grew tense in the effort to make no
sound

Hannah Cox was kneeling on the stone floor Her ear was close to the
crack of the door which led into the boathouse Her face half turned
from it was set in a strange concentrated passion of listening her
lips were parted her eyes half closed She took no more notice of Hamel
or his arrival than if he had been some useless piece of furniture
Every faculty seemed to be absorbed in that one intense effort of
listening There was no need of her outstretched finger Hamel fell
in at once with a mood so mesmeric He too listened The small clock
which she had brought with her from the village ticked away upon the
mantelpiece The full sea fell with placid softness upon the high beach
outside Some slight noise of cooking came from the stove Save for
these things there was silence Yet for a space of time which Hamel
could never have measured they both listened When at last the woman
rose to her feet Hamel finding words at last was surprised to find
that his throat was dry

What is it Mrs Cox he asked Why were you listening there

Her face was absolutely expressionless She was busying herself now with
a small saucepan and her back was turned towards him

I spend my life sir she said listening and waiting One never
knows when the end may come

But the boathouse Hamel objected No one has been in there his
morning have they

Who can tell she answered He could go anywhere when he chose or
how he chosethrough the keyhole if he wanted

But why listen Hamel persisted There is nothing in there now but
some odds and ends of machinery

She turned from the fire and looked at him for a moment Her eyes were
colourless her tone unemotional

Maybe Theres no harm in listening

Did you hear anything which made you want to listen

Who can tell she answered A woman who lives wellnigh alone as
I live in a quiet place hears things so often that other folk never
listen to Theres always something in my ears night or day Sometimes
I am not sure whether its in this world or the other It was like that
with me just then It was for that reason I listened Your luncheons
ready sir

Hamel walked thoughtfully back into his sittingroom He seated
himself before a spotless cloth and watched Hannah Cox spread out his
wellcooked cleanlyserved meal

If theres anything you want sir she said I shall hear you at a
word The kitchen door is open

One moment Mrs Cox

She lingered there patiently with the tray in her hand

There was some sound Hamel continued perhaps a real sound perhaps
a fancy which made you go down on your knees in the kitchen Tell me
what it was

The sound I always hear sir she answered quietly I hear it in the
night and I hear it when I stand by the sea and look out I have heard
it for so many years that who can tell whether it comes from this world
or the otherthe cry of men who die

She passed out Hamel looked after her for a moment like a man in
a dream In his fancy he could see her back again once more in the
kitchen kneeling on the stone floorlistening




CHAPTER XXIX

A cold twilight had fallen upon the land when Hamel left the Tower
that evening and walked briskly along the footway to the Hall Little
patches of mist hung over the creeks the sky was almost frosty The
lights from St Davids Hall shone like cheerful beacons before him He
hastened up the stone steps crossed the terrace and passed into
the hall A servant conducted him at once to the drawingroom Mrs
Fentolin in a pink evening dress with a pink ornament in her hair
held out both her hands In the background Mr Fentolin in his
queerlycut evening clothes sat with folded arms leaning back in his
carriage He listened grimly to his sisterinlaw as she stood with
Hamels hands in hers

My dear Mr Hamel she exclaimed How perfectly charming of you to
come up and relieve a little our sad loneliness Delightful I call it
of you I was just saying so to Miles

Hamel looked around the room Already his heart was beginning to sink

Miss Fentolin is well I hope he asked

Well but a very naughty girl her mother declared I let her go to
Lady Saxthorpes to lunch and now we have had simply the firmest letter
from Lady Saxthorpe They insist upon keeping Esther to dine and sleep
I have had to send her evening clothes but you cant tell Mr Hamel
how I miss her


Hamels disappointment was a little too obvious to pass unnoticed
There was a shade of annoyance too in his face Mr Fentolin smoothly
intervened

Let us be quite candid with Mr Hamel dear Florence he begged
I have spoken to my sisterinlaw and told her the substance of our
conversation this morning he proceeded wheeling his chair nearer to
Hamel She is thunderstruck She wishes to reflect to consider
Esther chanced to be away We have encouraged her absence for a few more
hours

I hope Mrs Fentolin Hamel said simply that you will give her to
me I am not a rich man but I am fairly well off I should be willing
to live exactly where Esther wishes and I would do my best to make her
happy

Mrs Fentolin opened her lips once and closed them again She laughed
a littlea highpitched semihysterical laugh The hand which gripped
her fan was straining so that the blue veins stood out almost like
whipcord

Esther is very young Mr Hamel We must talk this over You have known
her for such a very short time

A servant announced dinner and Hamel offered his arm to his hostess

Is Gerald away too he asked

We do indeed owe you our apologies Mr Fentolin declared Gerald
is spending a couple of days at the Dormy House at Brancastera golf
arrangement made some time back

He promised to play with me tomorrow Hamel remarked thoughtfully
He said nothing about going away

I fear that like most young men of his age he has little memory Mr
Fentolin sighed However he will be back tomorrow or the next day I
owe you my apologies Mr Hamel for our lack of young people We must
do our best to entertain our guest Florence You must be at your best
dear You must tell him some of those capital stories of yours

Mrs Fentolin shivered for a moment Hamel as he handed her to her
place was struck by a strange look which she threw upon him half
furtive full of pain Her hand almost clung to his She slipped a
little and he held her tightly Then he was suddenly conscious that
something hard was being pressed into his palm He drew his hand away at
once

You seem a little unsteady this evening my dear Florence Mr
Fentolin remarked peering across the round table

She eyed him nonchalantly enough

The floor is slippery she said I was glad for a moment of Mr
Hamels strong hand Where are those dear puppies ChowChow she went
on come and sit by your mistress at once

Hamels fingers inside his waistcoat pocket were smoothing out the
crumpled piece of paper which she had passed to him Soon he had it
quite flat Mrs Fentolin as though freed from some anxiety chattered
away gaily

I dont know that I shall apologise to Mr Hamel at all for the young
people being away she declared Just fancy what we have saved him
froma solitary meal served by Hannah Cox Do you know that they say
she is halfwitted Mr Hamel

So far she has looked after me very well Hamel observed

Her intellect is defective Mr Fentolin remarked on one point only
The good woman is obsessed by the idea that her husband and sons are
still calling to her from the Dagger Rocks It is almost pitiful to meet
her wandering about there on a stormy night The seacoasts are full
of these little village tragediesreal tragedies too however
insignificant they may seem to us

Mr Fentolins tone was gently sympathetic He changed the subject a
moment or two later however

Nero fiddles tonight he said while Rome burns There are hundreds
in our position yet it certainly seems queer that we should be sitting
here so quietly when the whole country is in such a state of excitement
I see the press this morning is preaching an immediate declaration of
war

Against whom Mrs Fentolin asked

Mr Fentolin smiled

That does seem to be rather the trouble he admitted Russia
Austria Germany Italy and France are all assisting at a Conference to
which no English representative has been bidden In a sense of course
that is equivalent to an act of hostility from all these countries
towards England The question is whether we have or have not a secret
understanding with France and if so how far she will be bound by it
There is a rumour that when Monsieur Deschelles was asked formally whom
he represented that he repliedFrance and Great Britain There may
be something in it It is hard to see how any English statesman could
have left unguarded the Mediterranean with all that it means trusting
simply to the faith of a country with whom we have no binding agreement
On the other hand there is the mobilisation of the fleet If France
is really faithful one wonders if there was need for such an extreme
step

I am out of touch with political affairs Hamel declared I have been
away from England for so long

I on the other hand Mr Fentolin continued his eyes glittering a
little have made the study of the political situation in Europe my
hobby for years I have sent to me the leading newspapers of Berlin
Rome Paris St Petersburg and Vienna For two hours every day I
read them side by side It is curious sometimes to note the common
understanding which seems to exist between the Powers not bound by any
formal alliance For years war seemed a very unlikely thing and
now he added leaning forward in his chair I pronounce it almost a
certainty

Hamel looked at his host a little curiously Mr Fentolins gentleness
of expression seemed to have departed His face was hard his eyes
agleam He had almost the look of a bird of prey For some reason the
thought of war seemed to be a joy to him Perhaps he read something of
Hamels wonder in his expression for with a shrug of the shoulders he
dismissed the subject

Well he concluded all these things lie on the knees of the gods I
dare say you wonder Mr Hamel why a poor useless creature like myself
should take the slightest interest in passing events It is just the
fascination of the lookeron I want your opinion about that champagne
Florence dear you must join us We will drink to Mr Hamels health We
will perhaps couple that toast in our minds with the sentiment which I
am sure is not very far from your thoughts Florence

Hamel raised his glass and bowed to his host and hostess He was not
wholly at his ease It seemed to him that he was being watched with a
queer persistence by both of them Mrs Fentolin continued to talk and
laugh with a gaiety which was too obviously forced Mr Fentolin
posed for a while as the benevolent listener He mildly applauded his
sisterinlaws stories and encouraged Hamel in the recital of some of
his reminiscences Suddenly the door was opened Miss Price appeared
She walked smoothly across the room and stood by Mr Fentolins side
Stooping down she whispered in his ear He pushed his chair back a
little from the table His face was dark with anger

I said not before ten tonight he muttered

Again she spoke in his ear so softly that the sound of her voice itself
scarcely travelled even as far as where Hamel was sitting Mr Fentolin
looked steadfastly for a moment at his sisterinlaw and from her to
Hamel Then he backed his chair away front the table

I shall have to ask to be excused for three minutes he said I must
speak upon the telephone It is a call from some one who declares that
they have important news

He turned the steeringwheel of his chair and with Miss Price by his
side passed across the diningroom out of the Oasis of roseshaded
lights into the shadows and through the open door From there he turned
his head before he disappeared as though to watch his guest Mrs
Fentolin was busy fondling one of her dogs which she had raised to her
lap and Hamel was watching her with a tolerant smile

Koto you little idiot why cant you sit up like your sister Was its
tail in the way then Mr Hamel she whispered under her breath so
softly that he barely caught the words although he was only a few feet
away dont look at me I feel as though we were being watched all the
time You can destroy that piece of paper in your pocket All that it
says is Leave here immediately after dinner

Hamel sipped his wine in a nonchalant fashion His fingers had strayed
over the silky coat of the little dog which she had held out as though
for his inspection

How can I he asked What excuse can I make

Invent one she insisted swiftly Leave here before ten oclock
Dont let anything keep you And destroy that piece of paper in your
pocket if you cannow

But Mrs Fentolin he began

She caught up one of her absurd little pets and held it to her mouth

Meekins is in the doorway she whispered

Dont argue with me please You are in danger you know nothing about
Pass me the cigarettes

She leaned back in her chair smoking quickly She held one of the dogs
on her knee and talked rubbish to it Hamel watched her leaning back
in his carved oak chair and he found it hard to keep the pity from
his eyes The woman was playing a part playing it with desperate and
pitiful earnestness a part which seemed the more tragical because of
the soft splendour of their surroundings From the shadowy walls
huge dimlyseen pictures hung about them a strange and yet impressive
background Their small round diningtable with its rare cut glass
its perfect appointments its bowls of pink roses was like a spot
of wonderful colour in the great room Two men servants stood at the
sideboard a few yards away a triumph of negativeness The butler who
had been absent for a moment stood now silently waiting behind his
masters place Hamel was oppressed during those few minutes of
waiting by a curious sense of unreality as though he were taking
part in some strange tableau There was something unreal about his
surroundings and his own presence there something unreal in the
atmosphere charged as it seemed to be with some omen of impending
happenings something unreal in that whispered warning those few
hoarsely uttered words which had stolen to his hearing across the
clusters of drooping roses the absurd babble of the woman who sat
there with tragic things under the powder with which her face was
daubed

Koto must learn to sit upon his taillike that No not another grape
till he sits up There then

She was leaning forward with a grape between her teeth towards the tiny
animal who was trying in vain to balance his absurdly shaped little body
upon the tablecloth Hamel without looking around knew quite well what
was happening Soon he heard the click of the chair Mr Fentolin was
back in his place His skin seemed paler and more parchmentlike than
ever His eyes glittered

It seems he announced quietly as he raised his wineglass to his
lips with the air of one needing support that we entertained an angel
unawares here This Mr Dunster is lost for the second time A very
important personage he turns out to be

You mean the American whom Gerald brought home after the accident
Mrs Fentolin asked carelessly

Mr Fentolin replied He insisted upon continuing his journey before he
was strong enough I warned him of what might happen He has evidently
been take ill somewhere It seems that he was on his way to The Hague

Do you mean that he has disappeared altogether this time Hamel asked

Mr Fentolin shook his head

No he has found his way to The Hague safely enough He is lying there
at a hotel in the city but he is unconscious There is some talk about
his having been robbed on the way At any rate they are tracing his
movements backwards We are to be honoured with a visit from one of
Scotland Yards detectives to reconstruct his journey from here Our
quiet little corner of the world is becoming quite notorious Florence
dear you are tired I can see it in your eyes Your headache continues
I am sure We will not be selfish Mr Hamel and I are going to have a
long evening in the library Let me recommend a phenacetin and bed

She rose at once to her feet with a dog under either arm

Ill take the phenacetin she promised but I hate going to bed
early Shall I see you again I wonder Mr Hamel

Not this evening I fear he answered I am going to ask Mr Fentolin
to excuse me early

She passed out of the room Hamel escorted her as far as the door and
then returned Mr Fentolin was sitting quite still in his chair His
eyes were fixed upon the tablecloth He looked up quickly as Hamel
resumed his seat

You are not in earnest I hope Mr Hamel he said when you tell me
that you must leave early I have been anticipating a long evening My
library is filled with books on South America which I want to discuss
with you

Another evening if you dont mind Hamel begged Tonight I must ask
you to excuse my hurrying away

Mr Fentolin looked up from underneath his eyelids His glance was quick
and penetrating

Why this haste

Hamel shrugged his shoulders

To tell you the truth he admitted I had an idea while I was reading
an article on cantilever bridges this morning I want to work it out

Mr Fentolin glanced behind him The door of the diningroom was closed
The servants had disappeared Meekins alone looking more like a prize
fighter than ever in his somber evening clothes had taken the place of
the butler behind his masters chair

We shall see Mr Fentolin said quietly




CHAPTER XXX

Mr Fentolin pointed to the little pile of books upon the table the
deep easychair the greenshaded lamps the decanter of wine He had
insisted upon a visit however brief to the library

It is a students appeal which I make to you Mr Hamel he said
with a whimsical smile Here we are in my study with the door closed
secure against interruption a bright fire in the grate a bowling and
everincreasing wind outside Let us go together over the ground of your
last wonderful expedition over the Andes You will find that I am not
altogether ignorant of your profession or of those very interesting
geological problems which you spoke of in connection with that
marvellous railway scheme We will discuss them side by side as
sybarites hang ourselves around with cigarette smoke drink wine and
presently coffee It is necessary is it not for many reasons that we
become better acquainted You realise that I am sure and you will not
persist in returning to your selfish solitude

Hamels eyes were fixed a little longingly upon some of the volumes with
which the table was covered

You must not think me ungrateful or churlish Mr Fentolin he begged
I have a habit of keeping promises which I make to myself and tonight
I have made myself a promise that I will be back at the Tower by ten
oclock

You are obdurate Mr Fentolin asked softly

I am afraid I am

Mr Fentolin busied himself with the handle of his chair

Tell me he insisted is there any other person save yourself to whom
you have given this mysterious promise

No one Hamel replied promptly

I am a person very sensitive to atmosphere Mr Fentolin continued
slowly Since the unfortunate visit of this man Dunster I seem to have
been conscious of a certain suspicion a little cloud of suspicion
under which I seem to live and move even among the members of my own
household My sisterinlaw is nervous and hysterical Gerald has been
sullen and disobedient Esther has avoided me And nowwell I find
even your attitude a little difficult to understand What does it mean
Mr Hamel

Hamel shook his head

I am not in the confidence of the different members of your family he
answered So far as I personally am concerned

It pleases me sometimes Mr Fentolin interrupted to interfere to
some extent in the affairs of the outside world If I do so that is
my business I do it for my own amusement It is at no time a serious
position which I take up Have I by any chance Mr Hamel become an
object of suspicion to you

There are matters in which you are concerned Hamel admitted which I
do not understand but I see no purpose in discussing them

Mr Fentolin wheeled his chair round in a semicircle He was now between
the door and Hamel

Weaker mortals than I Mr Hamel he said calmly have wielded
before now the powers of life and death From my chair I can make the
lightnings bite Science has done away with the triumph of muscularity
Even as we are here together at this moment Mr Hamel if we should
disagree it is I who am the preordained victor

Hamel saw the glitter in his hand This was the end then of all doubt
He remained silent

Suspicions which are in a sense absurd Mr Fentolin continued
have grown until I find them obtrusive and obnoxious What have I to do
with Mr John P Dunster I sent him out from my house If he is lost or
ill the affair is not mine Yet one by one those around me are falling
away I told you an hour ago that Gerald was at Brancaster It is a lie
He has left this house but no soul in it knows his destination

Hamel started

You mean that he has run away

Mr Fentolin nodded

All that I can surmise is that he has followed Dunster he proceeded
He has an idea that in some way I robbed or injured the man He has
broken the bond of relationship between us He has broken his solemn
vow He has run a grave and terrible risk

What of Miss Esther Hamel asked quickly

I have sent her away Mr Fentolin replied until we come to a clear
understanding you and I You seem to be a harmless enough person Mr
Hamel but appearances are sometimes deceptive It has been suggested to
me that you are a spy

By whom Hamel demanded

By those in whom I trust Mr Fentolin told him sternly You are
a friend of Reginald Kinsley You met him in Norwich the other
daysecretly Kinsleys chief is a member of the Government He is one
of those who will find eternal obloquy if The Hague Conference comes to
a successful termination For some strange reason I am supposed to have
robbed or harmed the one man in the world whose message might bring to
nought that Conference Are you here to watch me Mr Hamel Are you one
of those who believe that I am either in the pay of a foreign country
or that my harmless efforts to interest myself in great things are
efforts inimical to this country that I am in short a traitor

You must admit that many of your actions are incomprehensible Hamel
replied slowly There are things here which I do not understandwhich
certainly require explanation

Still why do you make them your business Mr Fentolin persisted If
indeed the course which I steer is a harmless one he continued with
a strange new glitter in his eyes then you are an impertinent stranger
to whom my doors cannot any longer be open If you have taken advantage
of my hospitality to spy upon me and my actions if indeed you have a
mission here then you can carry it with you down into hell

I understand that you are threatening me Hamel murmured

Mr Fentolin smiled

Scarcely that my young friend I am not quite the obvious sort of
villain who flourishes revolvers and lures his victims into secret
chambers These words to you are simply words of warning I am not like
other men neither am I used to being crossed When I am crossed I
am dangerous Leave here if you will in safety and mind your own
affairs but if you show one particle of curiosity as to mine if you
interfere in matters which concern me and me only remember that you are
encircled by powers which are entirely ruthless absolutely omnipotent
You can walk back to the Tower tonight and remember that there isnt a
step you take which might not be your last if I willed it and never a
soul the wiser Theres a very hungry little mother here who takes
her victims and holds them tight You can hear her calling to you now
Listen

He held up his finger The tide had turned and through the halfopen
window came the low thunder of the waves

You decline to share my evening Mr Fentolin concluded Let it be
so Go your own way Hamel only take care that your way does not cross
mine

He backed his chair slowly and pressed the bell Hamel felt himself
dismissed He passed out into the hall The door of the drawingroom
stood open and he heard the sound of Mrs Fentolins thin voice singing
some little French song He hesitated and then stepped in With one hand
she beckoned him to her continuing to play all the time He stepped
over to her side

I come to make my adieux he whispered with a glance towards the
door

You are leaving then she asked quickly

He nodded

Mr Fentolin is in a strange humour she went on a moment later
after she had struck the final chords of her song There are things
going on around us which no one can understand I think that one of his
schemes has miscarried he has gone too far He suspects you I cannot
tell you why or how If only you would go away

What about Esther he asked quietly

You must leave her she cried with a little catch in her throat
Gerald has broken away Esther and I must carry still the burden

She motioned him to go He touched her fingers for a moment

Mrs Fentolin he said I have been a good many years making up my
mind Now that I have done so I do not think that any one will keep
Esther from me

She looked at him a little pitifully a little wistfully Then with a
shrug of the shoulders she turned round to the piano and recommenced to
play Hamel took his coat and hat from a servant who was waiting in the
hall and passed out into the night

He walked briskly until he reached the Tower The wind had risen but
there was still enough light to help him on his way The little building
was in complete darkness He opened the door and stepped into the
sittingroom lit the lamp and holding it over his head went down
the passage and into the kitchen Then he gave a start The lamp nearly
slipped from his fingers Kneeling on the stone floor in very much the
same attitude as he had found her earlier in the day Hannah Cox was
crouching patiently by the door which led into the boathouse her
face expressionless her ear turned towards the crack She was still
listening




CHAPTER XXXI

Hamel set down the lamp upon the table He glanced at the little clock
upon the dresser it was a quarter past ten The woman had observed his
entrance although it seemed in no way to have discomposed her

Do you know the time Mrs Cox he asked You ought to have been home
hours ago What are you doing there

She rose to her feet Her expression was one of dogged but patient
humility

I started for home before nine oclock sir she told him but it was
worse than ever tonight All the way along by the sea I seemed to
hear their voices so I came back I came back to listen I have been
listening for an hour

Hamel looked at her with a frown upon his forehead

Mrs Cox he said I wish I could understand what it is that you
have in your mind Those are not real voices that you hear you cannot
believe that

Not real voices she repeated without the slightest expression in her
tone

Of course not And tell me what connection you find between these
fancies of yours and that room Why do you come and listen here

I do not know she answered patiently

You must have some reason he persisted

I have no reason she assured him only some day I shall see behind
these doors Afterwards I shall hear the voices no more

She was busy tying a shawl around her head Hamel watched her still
puzzled He could not get rid of the idea that there was some method
behind her madness

Tell meI have found you listening here before Have you ever heard
anything suspicious

I have heard nothing yet she admitted nothing that counts

Come he continued couldnt we clear this matter up sensibly Do
you believe that there is anybody in there Do you believe the place is
being used in any way for a wrong purpose If so we will insist upon
having the keys from Mr Fentolin He cannot refuse The place is mine

Mr Fentolin would not give you the keys sir she replied If he
did it would be useless

Would you like me to break the door in Hamel asked

You could not do it sir she told him not you nor anybody else The
door is thicker than my fist of solid oak It was a mechanic from New
York who fitted the locks I have heard it said in the villageBill
Hamas the carpenter declares that there are double doors The workmen
who were employed here were housed in a tent upon the beach and sent
home the day they finished their job They were never allowed in the
village They were foreigners most of them They came from nobody knows
where and when they had finished they disappeared Why was that sir
What is there inside which Mr Fentolin needs to guard so carefully

Mr Fentolin has invented something Hamel explained He keeps the
model in there Inventors are very jealous of their work

She looked down upon the floor for a moment

I shall be here at seven oclock in the morning sir I will give you
your breakfast at the usual time

Hamel opened the door for her

Good night Mrs Cox he said Would you like me to walk a little way
with you Its a lonely path to the village and the dikes are full

Thank you no sir she replied Its a lonely way right enough
but it isnt loneliness that frightens me I am less afraid out with the
winds and the darkness than under this roof If I lose my way and wander
all night upon the marsh Ill be safer out there than you sir

She passed away and Hamel watched her disappear into the darkness Then
he dragged out a bowl of tobacco and filled a pipe Although he was half
ashamed of himself he strolled back once more into the kitchen and
drawing up a stool he sat down just where he had discovered Hannah Cox
sat still and listened No sound of any sort reached him He sat there
for ten minutes Then he scrambled to his feet

She is mad of course he muttered

He mixed himself a whisky and soda relit his pipe which had gone out
and drew up an easychair to the fire which she had left him in the
sittingroom The wind had increased in violence and the panes of his
window rattled continually He yawned and tried to fancy that he was
sleepy It was useless He was compelled to admit the truththat his
nerves were all on edge In a sense he was afraid The thought of bed
repelled him He had not a single impulse towards repose Outside the
wind all the time was gathering force More than once his window was
splashed with the spray carried on by the wind which followed the tide
He sat quite still and tried to think calmly tried to piece together
in his mind the sequence of events which had brought him to this part of
the world and which had led to his remaining where he was an undesired
hangeron at the threshold of Miles Fentolin He had the feeling that
tonight he had burned his boats There was no longer any pretence
of friendliness possible between him and this strange creature Mr
Fentolin suspected him realised that he himself was suspected But
of what Hamel moved in his chair restlessly Sometimes that gathering
cloud of suspicion seemed to him grotesque Of what real harm could he
be capable this little autocrat who from his chair seemed to exercise
such a malign influence upon every one with whom he was brought into
contact Hamel sighed The riddle was insoluble With a sudden rush of
warmer and more joyous feelings he let the subject slip away from him
He closed his eyes and dreamed for a while There was a new world before
him joys which only so short a time ago he had fancied had passed him
by

He sat up in his chair with a start The fire had become merely a
handful of grey ashes his limbs were numb and stiff The lamp was
flickering out He had been dozing how long he had no idea Something
had awakened him abruptly There was a cold draught blowing through
the room He turned his head his hands still gripping the sides of his
chair His heart gave a leap The outer door was a few inches open was
being held open by some invisible force There was some one there some
one on the point of entering stealthily Even as he watched the crack
became a little wider He sat with his eyes riveted upon that opening
space The unseen hand was still at work Every instant he expected to
see a face thrust forward The sensation of absolute physical fear by
which he was oppressed was a revelation to him He found himself wishing
almost feverishly that he was armed The physical strength in which
he had trusted seemed to him at that instant a valueless and impotent
thing There was a splash of spray or raindrops against the window and
through the crack in the door The lamp chimney hissed and spluttered
and finally the light went out The room was in sudden darkness Hamel
sprang then to his feet Silence had become an intolerable thing He
felt the close presence of another human being creeping in upon him

Whos there he cried Whos there I say

There was no direct answer only the door was pushed a little further
open He had stepped close to it now The sweep of the wind was upon his
face although in the black darkness he could see nothing And then a
sudden recollection flashed in upon him From his trousers pocket he
snatched a little electric torch In an instant his thumb had pressed
the button He turned it upon the door The shivering white hand which
held it open was plainly in view It was the hand of a woman He stepped
swiftly forward A dark figure almost fell into his arms

Mrs Fentolin he exclaimed aghast

An hysterical cry choked and subdued broke from her lips He half
carried half led her to his easychair Suddenly steadied by the
presence of this unlookedfor emergency he closed the outside door and
relit the lamp with firm fingers Then he turned to face her and his
amazement at this strange visit became consternation

She was still in her dinnergown of black satin but it was soaked
through with the rain and hung about her like a black shroud She had
lost one shoe and there was a great hole in her silk stocking Her hair
was all disarranged one of its numerous switches was hanging down over
her ear The rouge upon her cheeks had run down on to her neck She sat
there looking at him out of her hollow eyes like some trapped animal
She was shaking with fear It was fear not faintness which kept her
silent

Tell me please what is the matter he insisted speaking as
indifferently as he could Tell me at once what has happened

She pointed to the door

Lock it she implored

He turned down the latch and drew the bolt The sound seemed to give her
a little courage Her fingers went to her throat for a moment

Give me some water

He poured out some sodawater She drank only a sip and put it down
again He began to be alarmed She had the appearance of one who has
suddenly lost her senses

Please tell me just what has happened he begged If I can help in
any way you know I will But you must tell me Do you realise that it
is three oclock I should have been in bed only I went to sleep over
the fire here

I know she answered It is just the wind that has taken away my
breath It was a hard struggle to get here Listenyou are our friend
Mr HamelEsthers and mine Swear that you are our friend

Upon my honour I am he assured her You should know that

For eight years she went on her voice clear enough now although it
seemed charged with a curious metallic vibration for eight years weve
borne it all three of us slaves bound hand and foot lashed with his
tongue driven along the path of his desires We have seen evil things
We have been on the point of rebellion and hes come a little nearer
and hes pointed back He has taken me by the hand and I have walked
by the side of his chair loathing it loathing myself out on to the
terrace and down below just where it happened You know what happened
there Mr Hamel

You mean where Mr Fentolin met with his accident

It was no accident she cried glancing for a moment around her It
was no accident It was my husband who took him up and threw him over
the terrace down below my husband who tried to kill him Esthers
fatherGeralds father Miles was in the Foreign Office then and he
did something disgraceful He sold a secret to Austria He was always
a great gambler and he was in debt Seymour found out about it He
followed him down here They met upon the terrace II saw it

He was silent for a moment

No one has known the truth he murmured

No one has ever known she assented and our broken lives have been
the price It was Miles himself who made the bargain Wewe cant go
on Mr Hamel

I begin to understand Hamel said softly You suffer everything from
Miles Fentolin because he kept the secret Very well that belongs to
the past Something has happened something tonight which has brought
you here Tell me about it

Once more her voice began to shake

Weve seenterrible thingshorrible things she faltered Weve
held our peace Perhaps its been nearly as bad before but weve closed
our eyes we havent wanted to know Nowwe cant help it Mr Hamel
Esther isnt at Lord Saxthorpes She never went there They didnt ask
her And Dunsterthe man Dunster

Where is Esther Hamel interrupted suddenly

Locked up away from you locked up because she rebelled

And Dunster

She shook her head Her eyes were filled with horror

But he left the HallI saw him

She shook her head

It wasnt Dunster It was the man Miles makes use ofRyan the
librarian He was once an actor

Where is Dunster then Hamel asked quickly What has become of him

She opened her lips and closed them again struggled to speak and
failed She sat there breathing quickly but silent The power of
speech had gone




CHAPTER XXXII

Hamel for the next few minutes forgot everything else in his efforts
to restore to consciousness his unexpected visitor He rebuilt the
fire heated some water upon his spirit lamp and forced some hot drink
between the lips of the woman who was now almost in a state of collapse
Then he wrapped her round in his own ulster and drew her closer to the
fire He tried during those few moments to put away the memory of all
that she had told him Gradually she began to recover She opened her
eyes and drew a little sigh She made no effort at speech however She
simply lay and looked at him like some wounded animal He came over to
her side and chafed one of her cold hands

Come he said at last you begin to look more like yourself now You
are quite safe in here and for Esthers sake as well as your own you
know that I am your friend

She nodded and her fingers gently pressed his

I am sure of it she murmured

Now let us see where we are he continued Tell me exactly why you
risked so much by leaving St Davids Hall tonight and coming down
here Isnt there any chance that he might find out

I dont know she answered It was Lucy Price who sent me She came
to my room just as I was undressing

Lucy Price he repeated The secretary

Yes She told me that she had meant to come to you herself She sent
me instead She thought it best This man Dunster is being kept alive
because there is something Miles wants him to tell him and he wont
But tonight if he is still alive if he wont tell they mean to make
away with him They are afraid

Miss Price told you this Hamel asked gravely

Mrs Fentolin nodded

Yes She said so She knowsshe knows everything She has been like
the rest of us She too has suffered She too has reached the
breaking point She loved him before the accident She has been his
slave ever since Listen

She suddenly clutched his arm They were both silent There was nothing
to be heard but the wind She leaned a little closer to him

Lucy Price sent me here tonight because she was afraid that it was
tonight they meant to take him from his hidingplace and kill him The
police have left off searching for Mr Dunster in Yarmouth and at The
Hague There is a detective in the neighbourhood and another one on his
way here They are afraid to keep him alive any longer

Where was Mr Fentolin when you left Hamel asked

I asked Lucy Price that she replied When she came to my room
there were no signs of his leaving She told me to come and tell you
everything Do you know where Mr Dunster is

Hamel shook his head

Within a few yards of here she went on He is in the boathouse
the place where Miles told you he kept a model of his invention They
brought him here the night before they put his clothes on Ryan and sent
him off disguised as Mr Dunster in the car to Yarmouth

Hamel started up but she clutched at his arm and pulled him back No
she cried you cant break in There are double doors and a wonderful
lock The boathouse is yours the building is yours In the morning you
must demand the keysif he does not come tonight

And how are we to know Hamel asked if he comes tonight

Go outside she whispered Look towards St Davids Hall and tell me
how many lights you can see

He drew back the bolt unlatched the door and stepped out into the
darkness The wind and the driving rain beat against his face A cloud
of spray enveloped and soaked him Like lamps hung in the sky the
lights of St Davids Hall shone out through the black gulf He counted
them carefully then he stepped back

There are seven he told her closing the door with an effort

She counted upon her fingers

I must come and see she muttered I must be sure Help me

He lifted her to her feet and they staggered out together

Look she went on gripping his arm You see that row of lights If
anything happens if Mr Fentolin leaves the Hall tonight to come down
here a light will appear on the left in the far corner We must watch
for that light We must watch

The words whispered hoarsely into his ear suddenly died away Even
as they stood there far away from the other lights another one shone
suddenly out in the spot towards which she had pointed and continued
to burn steadily He felt the woman who was clinging to his arm become
suddenly a dead weight

She was right Mrs Fentolin moaned He is coming down tonight He
is preparing to leave now perhaps he has already started What shall we
do What shall we do

Hamel was conscious of a gathering sense of excitement He too looked
at the signal which was flashing out its message towards them Then
he gripped his companions arm and almost carried her back into the
sittingroom

Look here he said firmly you can do nothing further You have
done your part and done it well Stay where you are and wait The rest
belongs to me

But what can you do she demanded her voice shaking with fear
Meekins will come with him and Doctor Sarson unless he is here
already What can you do against them Meekins can break any ordinary
mans back and Mr Fentolin will have a revolver

Hamel threw another log on to the fire and drew her chair closer to it

Never mind about he declared cheerfully Mr Fentolin is too clever
to attempt violence except as a last resource He knows that I have
friends in London who would need some explanation of my disappearance
Stay here and wait

She recognised the note of authority in his tone and she bowed her
head Then she looked up at him she was a changed woman

Perhaps I have done ill to drag you into our troubles Mr Hamel she
said and yet I believe in you I believe that you really care for
Esther If you can help us now it will be for your happiness too You
are a man God bless you

Hamel groped his way round the side of the Tower and took up a position
at the extreme corner of the landward side of the building within a
yard of the closed doors The light far out upon the left was still
gleaming brightly but two of the others in a line with it had
disappeared He flattened himself against the wall and waited listening
intently his eyes straining through the darkness Yet they were almost
upon him before he had the slightest indication of their presence A
single gleam of light in the path come and gone like a flash the gleam
of an electric torch directed momentarily towards the road was his
first indication that they were near A moment or two later he heard
the strange click click of the little engine attached to Mr Fentolins
chair Hamel set his teeth and stepped a few inches further back The
darkness was so intense that they were actually within a yard or so of
him before he could even dimly discern their shapes There were three
of themMr Fentolin in his chair Doctor Sarson and Meekins They
paused for a moment while the latter produced a key Hamel distinctly
heard a slow soft whisper from Doctor Sarson

Shall I go round to the front and see that he is in bed

No need Mr Fentolin replied calmly It is nearly four oclock
Better not to risk the sound of your footsteps upon the pebbles Now

The door swung noiselessly open The darkness was so complete that even
though Hamel could have touched them with an outstretched hand their
shapes were invisible Hamel who had formed no definite plans had no
time to hesitate As the last one disappeared through the door he
too slipped in He turned abruptly to the left and holding his breath
stood against the wall The door closed behind them The gleam of the
electric light flashed across the stone floor and rested for a moment
upon a trapdoor which Meekins had already stooped to lift It fell
back noiselessly upon rubber studs and Meekins immediately slipped
through it a ladder on either side of which was a grooved stretch of
board evidently fashioned to allow Mr Fentolins carriage to pass
down Hamel held his breath The moment for him was critical If the
light flashed once in his direction he must be discovered Both Meekins
and Doctor Sarson however were intent upon the task of steering Mr
Fentolins little carriage down below They placed the wheels in the two
grooves and Meekins secured the carriage with a rope which he let
run through his fingers As soon as the little vehicle had apparently
reached the bottom he turned thrust the electric torch in his pocket
and stepped lightly down the ladder Doctor Sarson followed his example
They disappeared in perfect silence and left the door open Presently a
gleam of light came travelling up from which Hamel knew that they had
lit a lamp below Very softly he crept across the floor threw himself
upon his stomach and peered down Below him was a room or rather a
cellar parts of which seemed to have been cut out of the solid rock
Immediately underneath was a plain iron bedstead on which was lying
stretched the figure of a man In those first few moments Hamel failed
altogether to recognise Mr Dunster He was thin and white and he
seemed to have shrunken his face with its coarse growth of beard
seemed like the face of an old man Yet the eyes were open eyes dull
and heavy as though with pain So far no word had been spoken but at
that moment Mr Fentolin broke the silence

My dear guest he said I bring you our most sincere apologies
It has gone very much against the grain I can assure you to have
neglected you for so long a time It is entirely the fault of the very
troublesome young man who occupies the other portion of this building
In the daytime his presence makes it exceedingly difficult for us to
offer you those little attentions which you might naturally expect

The man upon the bed neither moved nor changed his position in any way
Nor did he speak All power of initiative seemed to have deserted him
He lay quite still his eyes fixed upon Mr Fentolin

There comes a time the latter continued when every one of us is
confronted with what might be described as the crisis of our lives
Yours has come my guest at precisely this moment It is if my watch
tells me the truth five and twenty minutes to four It is the last
day of April The year you know You have exactly one minute to decide
whether you will live a short time longer or whether you will on this
last day of April and beforesay a quarter to four make that little
journey the nature of which you and I have discussed more than once

Still the man upon the bed made no movement nor any reply Mr Fentolin
sighed and beckoned to Doctor Sarson

I am afraid he whispered that that wonderful drug of yours Doctor
has been even a little too farreaching in its results It has kept our
friend so quiet that he has lost even the power of speech perhaps even
the desire to speak A little restorative I thinkjust a few drops

Doctor Sarson nodded silently He drew from his pocket a little phial
and poured into a wineglass which stood on a table by the side of the
bed half a dozen drops of some rubycoloured liquid to which he added
a tablespoonful of water Then he leaned once more over the bed and
poured the contents of the glass between the lips of the semiconscious
man

Give him two minutes he said calmly He will be able to speak then

Mr Fentolin nodded and leaned back in his chair He glanced around the
room a little critically There was a thick carpet upon the floor a
sofa piled with cushions in one corner and several other articles of
furniture The walls however were uncovered and were stained with
damp A great pink fungus stood out within a few inches of the bed a
grim mixture of exquisite colouring and loathsome imperfections The
atmosphere was fetid Meekins suddenly struck a match and lit some
grains of powder in a saucer A curious odour of incense stole through
the place Mr Fentolin nodded appreciatively

That is better he declared Really the atmosphere here is
positively unpleasant I am ashamed to think that our guest has had to
put up with it so long And yet he went on I think we must call it
his own fault I trust that he will no longer be obstinate

The effect of the restorative began to show itself The man on the bed
moved restlessly His eyes were no longer altogether expressionless He
was staring at Mr Fentolin as one looks at some horrible vision Mr
Fentolin smiled pleasantly

Now you are looking more like your old self my dear Mr Dunster he
remarked I dont think that I need repeat what I said when I first
came need I You have just to utter that one word and your little
visit to us will be at an end

The man looked around at all of them He raised himself a little on
his elbow For the first time Hamel crouching above recognised any
likeness to Mr John P Dunster

Ill see you in hell first

Mr Fentolins face momentarily darkened He moved a little nearer to
the man upon the bed

Dunster he said I am in grim earnest Never mind arguments Never
mind why I am on the other side They are restless about you in America
Unless I can cable that word tomorrow morning theyll communicate
direct with The Hague and I shall have had my trouble for nothing It
is not my custom to put up with failure Therefore let me tell you
that no single one of my threats has been exaggerated My patience has
reached its breaking point Give me that word or before four oclock
strikes you will find yourself in a new chamber among the corpses of
those misguided fishermen mariners of ancient days and a few others
Its only a matter of fifty yards out to the great sea pit below the
Dagger RocksIve spoken to you about it before havent I So surely
as I speak to you of it at this moment

Mr Fentolins speech came to an abrupt termination A convulsive
movement of Meekins an expression of blank amazement on the part of
Doctor Sarson had suddenly checked the words upon his lips He turned
his head quickly in the direction towards which they had been gazing
towards which in fact at that moment Meekins with a low cry had made
a fruitless spring The ladder down which they had descended was slowly
disappearing Meekins with a jump missed the last rung by only a few
inches Some unseen hand was drawing it up Already the last few feet
were vanishing in midair Mr Fentolin sat quite quiet and still He
looked through the trapdoor and saw Hamel

Most ingenious and I must confess most successful my young friend
he exclaimed pleasantly When you have made the ladder quite secure
perhaps you will be so good as to discuss this little matter with us

There was no immediate reply The eyes of all four men were turned now
upon that empty space through which the ladder had finally disappeared
Mr Fentolins fingers disappeared within the pocket of his coat
Something very bright was glistening in his hand when he withdrew it

Come and parley with us Mr Hamel he begged You will not find us
unreasonable

Hamels voice came back in reply but Hamel himself kept well away from
the opening

The conditions he said are unpropitious A little time for
reflection will do you no harm

The trapdoors were suddenly closed Mr Fentolins face as he looked
up became diabolic

We are trapped he muttered caught like rats in a hole




CHAPTER XXXIII

A gleam of day was in the sky as Hamel with Mrs Fentolin by his side
passed along the path which led from the Tower to St Davids Hall
Lights were still burning from its windows the outline of the building
itself was faintly defined against the sky Behind him across the sea
was that one straight line of grey merging into silver The rain had
ceased and the wind had dropped On either side of them stretched the
brimming creeks

Can we get into the house without waking any one he asked

Quite easily she assured him The front door is never barred

She walked by his side swiftly and with surprising vigour In the
still grey light her face was more ghastly than ever but there was a
new firmness about her mouth a new decision in her tone They reached
the Hall without further speech and she led the way to a small door
on the eastern side through which they entered noiselessly and passed
along a little passage out into the hall A couple of lights were still
burning The place seemed full of shadows

What are you going to do now she whispered

I want to ring up London on the telephone he replied I know that
there is a detective either in the neighbourhood or on his way here but
I shall tell my friend that he had better come down himself

She nodded

I am going to release Esther she said She is locked in her room
The telephone is in the study I will come down there to you

She passed silently up the broad staircase Hamel groped his way across
the hall into the library He turned on the small electric readinglamp
and drew up a chair to the side of the telephone Even as he lifted the
receiver to his ear he looked around him half apprehensively It seemed
as though every moment he would hear the click of Mr Fentolins chair

He got the exchange at Norwich without difficulty and a few minutes
later a sleepy reply came from the number he had rung up in London It
was Kinsleys servant who answered

I want to speak to Mr Kinsley at once upon most important business
Hamel announced

Very sorry sir the man repelled Mr Kinsley left town last night
for the country

Where has he gone Hamel demanded quickly You can tell me You know
who I am I am Mr Hamel

Into Norfolk somewhere sir He went with several other gentlemen

Is that Bullen Hamel asked

The man admitted the fact

Can you tell me if any of the people with whom Mr Kinsley left London
were connected with the police he inquired

The man hesitated

I believe so sir he admitted The gentlemen started in a motorcar
and were going to drive all night

Hamel laid down the receiver At any rate he would not be left long
with this responsibility upon him He walked out into the hall The
house was still wrapped in deep silence Then from somewhere above him
coming down the stairs he heard the rustle of a womans gown He looked
up and saw Miss Price fully dressed coming slowly towards him
She held up her finger and led the way back into the library She was
dressed as neatly as ever but there was a queer light in her eyes

I have seen Mrs Seymour Fentolin she said She tells me that you
have left Mr Fentolin and the others in the subterranean room of the
Tower

Hamel nodded

They have Dunster down there he told her I followed them in it
seemed the best thing to do I have a friend from London who is on his
way down here now with some detective officers to enquire into the
matter of Dunsters disappearance

Are you going to leave them where they are until these people arrive
she asked

I think so he replied after a moments hesitation I dont seem to
have had time to consider even what to do The opportunity came and I
embraced it There they are and they wont dare to do any further harm
to Dunster now Mrs Fentolin was down in my room and I thought it best
to bring her back first before I even parleyed with them again

You must be careful she advised slowly The man Dunster has been
drugged he has lost some of his will he may have lost some of his
mental balance Mr Fentolin is clever He will find a dozen ways to
wriggle out of any charge that can be brought against him You know what
he has really done

I can guess

He has kept back a document signed by the twelve men in America who
control the whole of Wall Street who control practically the money
markets of the world That document is a warning to Germany that they
will have no war against England Owing to Mr Fentolin it has not been
delivered and the Conference is sitting now War may be declared at any
moment

But as a matter of common sense Hamel asked why does Mr Fentolin
desire war

You do not understand Mr Fentolin she told him quietly He is not
like other men There are some who live almost entirely for the sake
of making others happy who find joy in seeing people content and
satisfied Mr Fentolin is the reverse of this He has but one craving
in life to see pain in others To see a human being suffer is to him a
debauch of happiness A war which laid this country waste would fill
him with a delight which you could never understand There are no normal
human beings like this It is a disease in the man a disease which came
upon him after his accident

Yet you have all been his slaves Hamel said curiously

We have all been his slaves she admitted for different reasons
Before his accident came Mr Fentolin was my master and the only man
in the world for me After his accident I think my feelings for him
if anything grew stronger I became his slave I sold my conscience my
selfrespect everything in life worth having to bring a smile to his
lips to help him through a single moment of his misery And just lately
the reaction has come He has played with me just as he would sit and
pull the legs out of a spider to watch its agony I have been one of his
favourite amusements And even now if he came into this room I think
that I should be helpless I should probably fall at his feet and pray
for forgiveness

Hamel looked at her wonderingly

I have come down to warn you she went on It is possible that this
is the beginning of the end that his wonderful fortune will desert him
that his star has gone down But remember that he has the brains and
courage of genius You think that you have him in a trap Dont be
surprised when you go back to find that he has turned the tables upon
you

Impossible Hamel declared I looked all round the place There isnt
a window or opening anywhere The trapdoor is in the middle of the
ceiling and it is fifteen feet from the floor It shuts with a spring

It may be as you say she observed It may be that he is safe
Remember though if you go near him that he is desperate

Do you know where Miss Fentolin is he interrupted

She is with her mother the woman replied impatiently She is coming
down Tell me what are you going to do with Mr Fentolin Nothing else
matters

I have a friend Hamel answered who will see to that

If you are relying upon the law she said I think you will find
that the law cannot touch him Mr Dunster was brought to the house in
a perfectly natural manner He was certainly injured and injured in
a railway accident Doctor Sarson is a fully qualified surgeon and he
will declare that Mr Dunster was unfit to travel If necessary they
will have destroyed the mans intelligence If you think that you have
him broken let me warn you that you may be disappointed Let me if I
may give you one word of advice

Please do Hamel begged

She looked at him coldly Her tone was still free from any sort of
emotion

You have taken up some sort of position here she continued as a
friend of Mrs Seymour Fentolin a friend of the family Dont let them
come back under the yoke You know the secret of their bondage

I know it he admitted

They have been his slaves because their absolute obedience to his will
was one of the conditions of his secrecy He has drawn the cords too
tight Better let the truth be known if needs be than have their three
lives broken Dont let them go back under his governance For me I
cannot tell If he comes back as he will come back I may become his
slave again but let them break away Listenthat is Mrs Fentolin

She left him Hamel followed her out into the hall Esther and her
mother were already at the foot of the stairs He drew them into the
study Esther gave him her hands but she was trembling in every limb

I am terrified she whispered Every moment I think I can hear the
click of that awful carriage He will come back I am sure he will come
back

He may Hamel answered sturdily but never to make you people his
slaves again You have done enough You have earned your freedom

I agree Mrs Fentolin said firmly We have gone on from sacrifice
to sacrifice until it has become a habit with us to consider him the
master of our bodies and our souls Today Esther we have reached the
breaking point Not even for the sake of that message from the other
side of the grave not even to preserve his honour and his memory can
we do more

Hamel held up his finger He opened the French windows and they
followed him out on to the terrace The grey dawn had broken now over
the sea There were gleams of fitful sunshine on the marshes Some
distance away a large motorcar was coming rapidly along the road




CHAPTER XXXIV

Mr John P Dunster lying flat upon his little bed watched with
dilated eyes the disappearance of the ladder Then he laughed It was a
queer soundbroken spasmodic devoid of any of the ordinary elements
of humorand yet it was a laugh Mr Fentolin turned his head towards
his prisoner and nodded thoughtfully

What a constitution my friend he exclaimed without any trace of
disturbance in his voice And what a sense of humour Strange that a
trifling circumstance like this should affect it Meekins burn some
more of the powder The atmosphere down here may be salubrious but I am
unaccustomed to it

Perhaps Mr Dunster said in a hollow tone you will have some
opportunity now of discovering with me what it is like

That too is just possible Mr Fentolin admitted blowing out a
little volume of smoke from a cigarette which he had just lit but one
never knows We have friends and our position although I must admit
a little ridiculous is easily remedied But how that mischiefmaking
Mr Hamel could have found his way into the boathouse does I must
confess perplex me

He must have been hanging around and followed us in when we came
Meekins muttered Somehow I fancied I felt some one near

Our young friend Mr Fentolin continued has without doubt an
obvious turn of mind He will send for his acquaintance in the Foreign
Office they will haul out Mr Dunster here and he will have a belated
opportunity of delivering his message at The Hague

You arent going to murder me first then Mr Dunster grunted

Mr Fentolin smiled at him benignly

My dear and valued guest he protested why so forbidding an idea
Let me assure you from the bottom of my heart that any bodily harm to
you is the most unlikely thing in the world You see though you might
not think it he went on I love life That is why I keep a doctor
always by my side That is why I insist upon his making a complete study
of my constitution and treating me in every respect as though I were
indeed an invalid I am really only fiftynine years old It is my
intention to live until I am eightynine An offence against the law of
the nature you indicate might interfere materially with my intentions

Mr Dunster struggled for a moment for breath

Look here he said thats all right but do you suppose you wont be
punished for what youve done to me You laid a deliberate plot to bring
me to St Davids Hall youve kept me locked up dosed me with drugs
brought me down here at the dead of night kept me a prisoner in a
dungeon Do you think you can do that for nothing Do you think you
wont have to suffer for it

Mr Fentolin smiled

My dear Mr Dunster he reminded him you were in a railway accident
you know there is no possible doubt about that And the wound in your
head is still there in a very dangerous place Men who have been in
railway accidents and who have a gaping wound very close to their
brain are subject to delusions I have simply done my best to play the
Good Samaritan Your clothes and papers are all untouched If my eminent
physician had pronounced you ready to travel a week ago you would
certainly have been allowed to depart a week ago Any interference in
your movements has been entirely in the interests of your health

Mr Dunster tried to sit up but found himself unable

So you think they wont believe my story eh he muttered Well we
shall see

Mr Fentolin thoughtfully contemplated the burning end of his cigarette
for a moment

If I believed he said that there was any chance of your statements
being accepted I am afraid I should be compelled in all our interests
to ask Doctor Sarson to pursue just a step further that experiment into
the anatomy of your brain with which he has already trifled

Mr Dunsters face was suddenly ghastly His reserve of strength seemed
to ebb away The memory of some horrible moment seemed to hold him in
its clutches

For Gods sake leave me alone he moaned Let me get away thats
all let me crawl away

Ah Mr Fentolin murmured That sounds much more reasonable When you
talk like that my friend I feel indeed that there is hope for you
Let us abandon this subject for the present Have you solved the puzzle
yet he asked Meekins

Meekins was standing below the closed trapdoor He had already dragged
up a wooden case underneath and was piling it with various articles of
furniture

Not yet sir he replied When I have made this steadier I am just
going to see what pressure I can bring to bear on the trapdoor

I heard the bolts go Doctor Sarson remarked uneasily

In that case Mr Fentolin declared it will indeed be an interesting
test of our friend Meekins boasted strength Meekins holds his placea
very desirable place toochiefly for two reasons first his discretion
and secondly his muscles He has never before had a real opportunity of
testing the latter We shall see

Doctor Sarson came slowly and gravely to the bedside He looked down
upon his patient Mr Dunster shivered

I am not sure sir he said very softly that Mr Dunster in his
present state of mind is a very safe person to be allowed his freedom
It is true that we have kept him here for his own sake because of his
fits of mental wandering Our statements however may be doubted
An apparent return to sanity on his part may lend colour to his
accusations especially if permanent Perhaps it would be as well to
pursue that investigation a shade further A touch more to the left and
I do not think that Mr Dunster will remember much in this world likely
to affect us

Mr Dunsters face was like marble There were beads of perspiration
upon his forehead his eyes were filled with reminiscent horror Mr
Fentolin bent over him with genuine interest

What a picture he would make he murmured What a drama Do you know
I am half inclined to agree with you Sarson The only trouble is that
you have not your instruments here

I could improvise something that would do the trick the doctor said
thoughtfully It really isnt a complicated affair It seems to me that
his story may gain credence from the very fact of our being discovered
in this extraordinary place To have moved him here was a mistake sir

Perhaps so Mr Fentolin admitted with a sigh It was our young
friend Mr Hamel who was responsible for it I fancied him arriving with
a search warrant at any moment We will bear in mind your suggestion for
a few minutes Let us watch Meekins This promises to be interesting

By dint of piling together all the furniture in the place the man was
now able to reach the trapdoor He pressed upon it vigorously without
even bending the wood Mr Fentolin smiled pleasantly

Meekins he said look at me

The man turned and faced his master His aspect of dogged civility had
never been more apparent

Now listen Mr Fentolin went on I want to remind you of certain
things Meekins We are among friends hereno secrecy you understand
or anything of that sort You need not be afraid You know how you came
to me You remember that little affair of Anna Jayes in Hartlepool

The face of the man was filled with terror He began to tremble where
he stood Mr Fentolin played for a moment with his collar as though he
found it tight

Such a chance it was my dear Meekins Mr Fentolin continued
cheerfully which brought me that little scrap of knowledge concerning
you It has bought me through all these years a good deal of faithful
service I am not ungrateful believe me I intend to retain you for my
bodyservant and to keep my lips sealed for a great many years to come
Now remember what I have said When we leave this place that little
episode will steal back into a far corner of my mind I shall in short
forget it If we are caught here and inconvenience follows well I
cannot say Do your best Meekins Do a little better than your best
You have the reputation of being a strong man Let us see you justify
it

The man took a long breath and returned to his task His shoulders and
arms were upon the door He began to strain He grew red in the face
the veins across his forehead stood out blue like tightlydrawn
string His complexion became purple Through his open mouth his breath
came in short pants With every muscle of his body and neck he strained
and strained The woodwork gave a little but it never even cracked
With a sob he suddenly almost collapsed Mr Fentolin looked at him
frowning

Very goodvery good Meekins he said but not quite good enough
You are a trifle out of practice perhaps Take your breath take time
Remember that you have another chance I am not angry with you Meekins
I know there are many enterprises upon which one does not succeed the
first time Get your breath there is no hurry Next time you try see
that you succeed It is very important Meekins for you as well as for
us that you succeed

The man turned doggedly back to his task The eyes of the three men
watched himMr Dunster on the bed Doctor Sarson pale and gloomy
with something of fear in his dark eyes and Mr Fentolin himself
whose expression seemed to be one of purely benevolent and encouraging
interest Once more the face of the man became almost unrecognisable
There was a great crack the trapdoor had shifted Meekins with a
little cry reeled and sank backwards Mr Fentolin clapped his hands
lightly

Really Meekins he declared I do not know when I have enjoyed any
performance so much I feel as if I were back in the days of the Roman
gladiators I can see that you mean to succeed You will succeed You do
not mean to end your days amid objectionable surroundings

With the air of a man temporarily mad Meekins went back to his task
He was sobbing to himself now His clothes had burst away from him
Suddenly there was a crash the hinges of the trapdoor had parted With
the blood streaming from a wound in his forehead Meekins staggered back
to his feet Mr Fentolin nodded

Excellent he pronounced Really excellent With a little assistance
from our friend Meekins you I am sure Sarson will now be able to
climb up and let down the steps

Doctor Sarson stood by Mr Fentolins chair and together they looked
up through the fragments of the trapdoor Meekins was still breathing
heavily Suddenly they heard the sound of a sharp report as of a door
above being slammed

Some one was in the boathouse when I broke the trapdoor Meekins
muttered I heard them moving about

Mr Fentolin frowned

Then let us hurry he said Sarson what about your patient

Mr Dunster was lying upon his side watching them The doctor went over
to the bedside and felt his pulse and head

He will do for twelve hours he pronounced If you think that other
little operation

He broke off and looked at Mr Fentolin meaningly The man on the bed
shrank back his eyes lit with horror Mr Fentolin smiled pleasantly

I fear he said that we must not stay for that just now A little
later on perhaps if it becomes necessary Let us first attend to the
business on hand

Meekins once more clambered on to the little heap of furniture The
doctor stood by his side for a moment Then with an effort he was
hoisted up until he could catch hold of the floor of the outhouse
Meekins gave one push and he disappeared

Any one up there Mr Fentolin enquired a shade of anxiety in his
tone

No one the doctor reported

Has anything been disturbed

Doctor Sarson was some little time before he replied

Yes he said some one seems to have been rummaging about

Send down the steps quickly Mr Fentolin ordered I am beginning to
find the atmosphere here unpleasant

There was a brief silence Then they heard the sound of the ladder being
dragged across the floor and a moment or two later it was carefully
lowered and placed in position Mr Fentolin passed the rope through the
front of his carriage and was drawn up From his bed Mr Dunster watched
them go It was hard to tell whether he was relieved or disappointed

Who has been in here Mr Fentolin demanded as he looked around the
place

There was no reply A grey twilight was struggling now through the
high dustcovered windows Meekins who had gone on towards the door
suddenly called out

Some one has taken away the key The door is locked on the other side

Mr Fentolins frown was malign even for him

Our dear friend Mr Hamel I suppose he muttered Another little
debt we shall owe him Try the other door

Meekins moved towards the partition Suddenly he paused Mr Fentolins
hand was outstretched he too was listening Above the low thunder of
the sea came another sound a sound which at that moment they none of
them probably understood There was the steady crashing of feet upon the
pebbles a low murmur of voices Mr Fentolin for the first time showed
symptoms of fear

Try the other door quickly he directed

Meekins came back shaking his head Outside the noise seemed to be
increasing The door was suddenly thrown open Hannah Cox stood outside
in her plain black dress her hair windtossed her eyes aflame She
held the key in her fingers and she looked in upon them Her lips
seemed to move but she said nothing

My good woman Mr Fentolin exclaimed frowning are you the person
who removed that key

She laid her hand upon his chair She took no notice of the other two

Come she said there is something here I want you to listen to
Come




CHAPTER XXXV


Mr Fentolin arrived outside on the stone front of the boathouse
pointed the wheel of his chair towards the Hall Hannah Cox who kept by
his side however drew it gently towards the beach

Down here she directed softly Bring your chair down the plankway
close to the waters edge

My good woman Mr Fentolin exclaimed furiously I am not in the
humour for this sort of thing Lock up Sarson at once I am in a hurry
to get back

But you will come just this little way she continued speaking
without any change of tone You see the others are waiting too I
have been down to the village and fetched them up

Mr Fentolin followed her outstretched finger and gave a sudden start
Standing at the edge of the sea were a dozen or twenty fishermen They
were all muttering together and looking at the top of the boathouse As
he realised the direction of their gaze Mr Fentolins face underwent a
strange transformation He seemed to shrink in his chair He was ghastly
pale even to the lips Slowly he turned his head From a place in the
roof of the boathouse a tall support had appeared On the top was a
swinging globe

What have you to do with that he asked in a low tone

I found it she answered I felt that it was there I have brought
them up with me to see it I think that they want to ask you some
questions But first come and listen

Mr Fentolin shook her off He looked around for Meekins

Meekins stand by my chair he ordered sharply Turn round I wish to
go to the Hall Drive this woman away

Meekins came hurrying up but almost at the same moment half a dozen of
the brown jerseyed fishermen detached themselves from the others They
formed a little bodyguard around the bathchair

What is the meaning of this Mr Fentolin demanded his voice shrill
with anger Didnt you hear what I said This woman annoys me Send her
away

Not one of the fishermen answered a word or made the slightest movement
to obey him One of them a greybearded veteran drew the chair a
little further down the planked way across the pebbles Hannah Cox kept
close to its side They came to a standstill only a few yards from where
the waves were breaking She lifted her hand

Listen she cried Listen

Mr Fentolin turned helplessly around The little group of fishermen
had closed in upon Sarson and Meekins The womans hand was upon his
shoulder she pointed seaward to where a hissing line of white foam
marked the spot where the topmost of the rocks were visible

You wondered why I have spent so much of my time out here she said
quietly Now you will know If you listen as I am listening as I have
listened for so many weary hours so many weary years you will hear
them calling to me David and John and Stephen The light Do you hear
what they are crying The light Fentolins light Look

She forced him to look once more at the top of the boathouse

They were right she proclaimed her voice gaining in strength and
intensity They were neither drunk nor reckless They steered as
straight as human hand could guide a tiller for Fentolins light And
there they are calling and calling at the bottom of the seamy three
boys and my man Do you know for whom they call

Mr Fentolin shrank back in his chair

Take this woman away he ordered the fishermen Do you hear Take her
away she is mad

They looked towards him but not one of them moved Mr Fentolin raised
his whistle to his lips and blew it

Meekins he cried Where are you Meekins

He turned his head and saw at once that Meekins was powerless Five or
six of the fishermen had gathered around him There were at least thirty
of them about sinewy powerful men The only person who moved towards
Mr Fentolins carriage was Jacob the coast guardsman

Mr Fentolin sir he said the lads have got your bully safe Its a
year and more that Hannah Cox has been about the village with some story
about two lights on a stormy night Its true what she saysthat her
man and boys lie drowned Theres William Green besides and a nephew
of my ownJohn Kallender And Philip Greenhe was saved He swore by
all that was holy that he steered straight for the light when his boat
struck and that as he swam for shore five minutes later he saw the
light reappear in another place Its a strange story What have you to
say sir about that

He pointed straight to the wireencircled globe which towered on its
slender support above the boathouse Mr Fentolin looked at it and
looked back at the coast guardsman The brain of a Machiavelli could
scarcely have invented a plausible reply

The light was never lit there he said It was simply to help me in
some electrical experiments

Then for the first time in their lives those who were looking on saw
Mr Fentolin apart from his carriage Without any haste but with amazing
strength Hannah Cox leaned over and with her arms around his middle
lifted him sheer up into the air She carried him clasped in her arms
a weird struggling object to the clumsy boat that lay always at the
top of the beach She dropped him into the bottom took her seat and
unshipped the oars For one moment the coast guardsman hesitated then
he obeyed her look He gave the boat a push which sent it grinding down
the pebbles into the sea The woman began to work at the oars Every now
and then she looked over her shoulder at that thin line of white surf
which they were all the time approaching

What are you doing woman Mr Fentolin demanded hoarsely Listen It
was an accident that your people were drowned Ill give you an annuity
Ill make you rich for liferich Do you understand what that means

Aye she answered looking down upon him as he lay doubled up at the
bottom of the boat I know what it means to be richbetter than you
maybe Not to let the gold and silver pieces fall through your fingers
or to live in a great house and be waited upon by servants who desert
you in the hour of need That isnt being rich Its rich to feel the
touch of the one you love to see the faces around of those youve given
birth to to move on through the days and nights towards the end with
them around not to know the chill loneliness of an empty life I am a
poor woman Mr Fentolin and its your hand that made me so and not
all the miracles that the Bible ever told of can make me rich again

You are a fool he shrieked You can buy forgetfulness The memory of
everything passes

I may be a fool she retorted grimly and you the wise man but this
day well both know the truth

There was a little murmur from the shore where the fishermen stood in a
long line

Bring him back missus Jacob called out Youve scared him enough
Bring him back Well leave him to the law

They were close to the line of surf now they had passed it indeed a
little on the left and the boat was drifting She stood up straight
and stern and her face as she looked towards the land was lit with
the fire of the prophetess

Aye she cried well leave him to the lawto the law of God

Then they saw her stoop down and once more with that almost superhuman
strength which seemed to belong to her for those few moments she lifted
the strange object who lay cowering there high above her head From the
shore they realised what was going to happen and a great shout arose
She stood on the side of the boat and jumped holding her burden tightly
in her arms So they went down and disappeared

Half a dozen of the younger fishermen were in the water even before
the grim spectacle was ended another ran for a boat that was moored a
little way down the beach But from the first the search was useless
Only Jacob who was a person afflicted with many superstitions wiped
the sweat from his forehead as he leaned over the bow of his boat and
looked down into that fathomless space

I heard her singing her or her wraith he swore afterwards Ill
never forget the moment I looked down and down and the water seemed to
grow clearer and I saw her walking there at the bottom among the rocks
with him over her back singing as she went looking everywhere for
George and the boys

But if indeed his eyes were touched with fire at that moment no one
else in the world saw anything more of Miles Fentolin




CHAPTER XXXVI

Mr John P Dunster removed the cigar from his teeth and gazed at the
long white ash with the air of a connoisseur He was stretched in a long
chair high up in the terraced gardens behind the Hall At his feet
were golden mats of yellow crocuses long borders of hyacinthspink
and purple beds of violets a great lilac tree with patches of blossom
here and there forcing their way into a sunlit world The sea was blue
the sheltered air where they sat was warm and perfumed Mr Dunster who
was occupying the position of a favoured guest was feeling very much at
home

There is one thing he remarked meditatively which I cant help
thinking about you Britishers You may deserve it or you may not but
you do have the most almighty luck

Sheer envy Hamel murmured We escape from our tight corners by
forethought

Not on your life sir Mr Dunster declared vigorously A year or
less ago you got a North Sea scare and on the strength of a merely
honourable understanding with your neighbour you risk your countrys
very existence for the sake of adding half a dozen battleships to your
North Sea Squadron The day the last of those battleships passed through
the Straits of Gibraltar this little Conference was plotted I tell you
they meant to make history there

There was enough for everybodyIndia for Russia a timehonoured
dream but why not AlsaceLorraine and perhaps Egypt for France
Australia for Japan China and South Africa for Germany Why not You
may laugh at it on paper but I say againwhy not

It didnt quite come off sir Gerald observed

It didnt Mr Dunster admitted partly owing to you There were
only two things needed France to consider her own big interests and to
ignore an entente from which she gains nothing that was not assured
to her under the new agreement and the money Strange Mr Dunster
continued how people forget that factor and yet the man who was
responsible for The Hague Conference knew it We in the States are right
outside all these little jealousies and wrangles that bring Europe
every now and then right up to the gates of war but Im hanged if
there is one of you dare pass through those gates without a hand on our
money markets Its a new word in history that little document news of
which Mr Gerald here took to The Hague the word of the money kings of
the world There is something that almost nips your breath in the idea
that a dozen men descended from the Lord knows whom stopped a war
which would have altered the whole face of history

There was never any proof Hamel remarked that France would not have
remained staunch to us

Very likely not Mr Dunster agreed but on the other hand your
country had never the right to put such a burden upon her honour
Remember that side by side with those other considerations a great
statesmans first duty is to the people over whom he watches not to
study the interests of other lands However its finished The Hague
Conference is broken up The official organs of the world allude to
it if at all as an unimportant gathering called together to discuss
certain frontier questions with which England had nothing to do But the
memory of it will live A good cold douche for you people I should say
and I hope youll take warning by it Whatever the attitude of America
as a nation may be to these matters the American people dont want to
see the old country in trouble Gee whiz Whats that

There was a little cry from all of them Only Hamel stood without sign
of surprise gazing downward with grim set face A dull roar like the
booming of a gun flashes of fire and a column of smokeand all that
was left of St Davids Tower was one tottering wall and a scattered
mass of masonry

I had an idea Hamel said quietly that St Davids Tower was going
to spoil the landscape for a good many years My property you know and
theres the end of it I am sick of seeing people for the last few days
come down and take photographs of it for every little rag that goes to
press

Mr Dunster pointed out to the line of surf beyond If only some hand
he remarked could plant dynamite below that streak of white so that
the sea could disgorge its dead They tell me theres a Spanish galleon
there and a Dutch warship besides a score or more of fishingboats

Mrs Fentolin shivered a little She drew her cloak around her Gerald
who had been watching her sprang to his feet

Come he exclaimed we chose the gardens for our last afternoon here
to be out of the way of these places Well go round the hill

Mrs Fentolin shook her head once more Her face had recovered its
serenity She looked downward gravely but with no sign of fear

There is nothing to terrify us there Gerald she declared The sea
has gathered and the sea will hold its own

Hamel held out his hand to Esther

I have destroyed the only house in the world which I possess he said
Come and look for violets with me in the spinney and let us talk
of the houses we are going to build and the dreams we shall dream in
them

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
