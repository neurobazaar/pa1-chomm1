THE ZEPPELINS PASSENGER

By E Phillips Oppenheim




CHAPTER I


Never heard a sound the younger of the afternoon callers admitted
getting rid of his empty cup and leaning forward in his low chair No
more tea thank you Miss Fairclough Done splendidly thanks No I
went to bed last night soon after eleventhe Colonel had been route
marching us all off our legsand I never awoke until reveille this
morning Sleep of the just and all that sort of thing but a jolly
sell all the same You hear anything of it sir he asked turning to
his companion who was seated a few feet away

Captain Griffiths shook his head He was a man considerably older than
his questioner with long nervous face and thick black hair streaked
with grey His fingers were bony his complexion for a soldier
curiously sallow and notwithstanding his height which was
considerable he was awkward at times almost uncouth His voice was
hard and unsympathetic and his contributions to the teatable talk had
been almost negligible

I was up until two oclock as it happened he replied but I knew
nothing about the matter until it was brought to my notice officially

Helen Fairclough who was doing the honours for Lady Cranston her
absent hostess assumed the slight air of superiority to which the
circumstances of the case entitled her

I heard it distinctly she declared in fact it woke me up I hung
out of the window and I could hear the engine just as plainly as though
it were over the golf links

The young subaltern sighed

Rotten luck I have with these things he confided Thats three times
theyve been over and Ive neither heard nor seen one This time they
say that it had the narrowest shave on earth of coming down Of course
youve heard of the observation car found on Dutchmans Common this
morning

The girl assented

Did you see it she enquired

Not a chance was the gloomy reply It was put on two covered trucks
and sent up to London by the first train Captain Griffiths can tell you
what it was like I dare say You were down there werent you sir

I superintended its removal the latter informed them It was a very
uninteresting affair

Any bombs in it Helen asked

Not a sign of one Just a hard seat two sets of fieldglasses and a
telephone It seems to have got caught in some trees and been dragged
off

How exciting the girl murmured I suppose there wasnt any one in
it

Griffiths shook his head

I believe he explained that these observation cars although they
are attached to most of the Zeppelins are seldom used in night raids

I should like to have seen it all the same Helen confessed

You would have been disappointed her informant assured her
Bytheby he added a little awkwardly are you not expecting Lady
Cranston back this evening

I am expecting her every moment The car has gone down to the station
to meet her

Captain Griffiths appeared to receive the news with a certain
undemonstrative satisfaction He leaned back in his chair with the air
of one who is content to wait

Have you heard Miss Fairclough his younger companion enquired a
little diffidently whether Lady Cranston had any luck in town

Helen Fairclough looked away There was a slight mist before her eyes

I had a letter this morning she replied She seems to have heard
nothing at all encouraging so far

And you havent heard from Major Felstead himself I suppose

The girl shook her head

Not a line she sighed Its two months now since we last had a
letter

Jolly bad luck to get nipped just as he was doing so well the young
man observed sympathetically

It all seems very cruel Helen agreed He wasnt really fit to go
back but the Board passed him because they were so short of officers
and he kept worrying them He was so afraid hed get moved to another
battalion Then he was taken prisoner in that horrible Pervais affair
and sent to the worst camp in Germany Since then of course Philippa
and I have had a wretched time worrying

Major Felstead is Lady Cranstons only brother is he not Griffiths
enquired

And my only fiance she replied with a little grimace However
dont let us talk about our troubles any more she continued with an
effort at a lighter tone Youll find some cigarettes on that table
Mr Harrison I cant think where Nora is I expect she has persuaded
some one to take her out trophyhunting to Dutchmans Common

The road all the way is like a circus the young soldier observed
and there isnt a thing to be seen when you get there The naval airmen
were all over the place at daybreak and Captain Griffiths wasnt
far behind them You didnt leave much for the sightseers sir he
concluded turning to his neighbour

As Commandant of the place Captain Griffiths replied I naturally
had to have the Common searched With the exception of the observation
car however I think that I am betraying no confidences in telling you
that we discovered nothing of interest

Do you suppose that the Zeppelin was in difficulties as she was flying
so low Helen enquired

It is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis the Commandant assented Two
patrol boats were sent out early this morning in search of her An old
man whom I saw at Waburne declares that she passed like a long black
cloud just over his head and that he was almost deafened by the noise
of the engines Personally I cannot believe that they would come down
so low unless she was in some trouble

The door of the comfortable library in which they were seated was
suddenly thrown open An exceedingly alertlooking young lady very
much befreckled and as yet unemancipated from the long plaits of the
schoolroom came in like a whirlwind In her hand she carried a mans
Homburg hat which she waved aloft in triumph

Come in Arthur she shouted to a young subaltern who was hovering
in the background Look what Ive got Helen A trophy Just look Mr
Harrison and Captain Griffiths I found it in a bush not twenty yards
from where the observation car came down

Helen turned the hat around in amused bewilderment

But my dear child she exclaimed this is nothing but an ordinary
hat People who travel in Zeppelins dont wear things like that How
do you do Mr Somerfield she added smiling at the young man who had
followed Nora into the room

Dont they the latter retorted with an air of superior knowledge
Just look here

She turned down the lining and showed it to them What do you make of
that she asked triumphantly

Helen gazed at the goldprinted letters a little incredulously

Read it out Nora insisted

Helen obeyed

 Schmidt
 Berlin
 Unter den Linden 127

That sounds German she admitted

Its a trophy all right Nora declared One of the crewprobably
the Commandermust have come on board in a hurry and changed into
uniform after they had started

It is my painful duty Miss Nora Harrison announced solemnly
to inform you on behalf of Captain Griffiths that all articles of
whatsoever description found in the vicinity of Dutchmans Common
which might possibly have belonged to any one in the Zeppelin must be
sent at once to the War Office

Rubbish Nora scoffed The War Office arent going to have my hat

Duty the young man began

You can go back to the Depot and do your duty then Mr Harrison
Nora interrupted but youre not going to have my hat Id throw it
into the fire sooner than give it up

Military regulations must be obeyed Miss Nora Captain Griffiths
ventured thoughtfully

Nothing so important as hats Harrison put in You see they
fitsomebody

The girls gesture was irreverent but convincing Id listen to
anything Captain Griffiths had to say she declared but you boys who
are learning to be soldiers are simply eaten up with conceit Theres
nothing in your textbook about hats If youre going to make yourselves
disagreeable about this I shall simply ignore the regiment

The two young men fell into attitudes of mock dismay Nora took a
chocolate from a box

Be merciful Miss Nora Harrison pleaded tearfully

Dont break the regiment up altogether Somerfield begged with a
little catch in his voice

All very well for you two to be funny Nora went on revisiting the
chocolate box but youve heard about the Seaforths coming havent
you I adore kilts and so does Helen dont you Helen

Every woman does Helen admitted smiling I suppose the child really
can keep the hat cant she she added turning to the Commandant

Officially the matter is outside my cognizance he declared I shall
have nothing to say

The two young men exchanged glances

A hat Somerfield ruminated especially a Homburg hat is scarcely an
appurtenance of warfare

His brother officer stood for a moment looking gravely at the object in
question Then he winked at Somerfield and sighed

I shall take the whole responsibility he decided magnanimously of
saying nothing about the matter We cant afford to quarrel with Miss
Nora can we Somerfield

Not on your life that young man agreed

Sensible boys Nora pronounced graciously

Thank you very much Captain Griffiths for not encouraging them in
their folly You can take me as far as the postoffice when you go
Arthur she continued turning to the fortunate possessor of the
sidecar and well have some golf tomorrow afternoon if you like

Wont Mr Somerfield have some tea Helen invited

Thank you very much Miss Fairclough the man replied we had tea
some time ago at Watsons where I found Miss Nora

Nora suddenly held up her finger Isnt that the car she asked Why
it must be mummy here already Yes I can hear her voice

Griffiths who had moved eagerly towards the window looked back

It is Lady Cranston he announced solemnly



CHAPTER II


The woman who paused for a moment upon the threshold of the library
looking in upon the little company was undeniably beautiful She
had masses of redgold hair a little disordered by her long railway
journey deepset hazel eyes a delicate almost porcelainlike
complexion and a sensitive delightfully shaped mouth Her figure
was small and dainty and just at that moment she had an appearance of
helplessness which was almost childlike Nora after a vigorous embrace
led her stepmother towards a chair

Come and sit by the fire Mummy she begged You look tired and
cold

Philippa exchanged a general salutation with her guests She was still
wearing her travelling coat and her air of fatigue was unmistakable
Griffiths who had not taken his eyes off her since her entrance
wheeled an easychair towards the hearthrug into which she sank with a
murmured word of thanks

Youll have some tea wont you dear Helen enquired

Philippa shook her head Her eyes met her friends for a momentit was
only a very brief glance but the tragedy of some mutual sorrow seemed
curiously revealed in that unspoken question and answer The two young
subalterns prepared to take their leave Nora kneeling down stroked
her stepmothers hand

No news at all then Helen faltered

None was the weary reply

Any amount of news here Mummy Nora intervened cheerfully and heaps
of excitement We had a Zeppelin over Dutchmans Common last night
and she lost her observation car Mr Somerfield took me up there this
afternoon and I found a German hat No one else got a thing and would
you believe it those children over there tried to take it away from
me

Her stepmother smiled faintly

I expect you are keeping the hat dear she observed

I should say so Nora assented

Philippa held out her hand to the two young men who had been waiting to
take their leave

You must come and dine one night this week both of you she said My
husband will be home by the later train this evening and Im sure he
will be glad to have you

Very kind of you Lady Cranston we shall be delighted Harrison
declared

Rather his companion echoed

Nora led them away and Helen with a word of excuse followed them
Griffiths who had also risen to his feet came a little nearer to
Philippas chair

And you too of course Captain Griffiths she said smiling
pleasantly up at him Must you hurry away

I will stay if I may until Miss Fairclough returns he answered
resuming his seat

Do Philippa begged him I have had such a miserable time in town
You cant think how restful it is to be back here

I am afraid he observed that your journey has not been successful

Philippa shook her head

It has been completely unsuccessful she sighed I have not been able
to hear a word about my brother I am so sorry for poor Helen too They
were only engaged you know a few days before he left for the front
this last time

Captain Griffiths nodded sympathetically

I never met Major Felstead he remarked but every one who has
seems to like him very much He was doing so well too up to that last
unfortunate affair wasnt he

Dick is a dear Philippa declared I never knew any one with so many
friends He would have been commanding his battalion now if only he
were free His colonel wrote and told me so himself

I wish there were something I could do Griffiths murmured a little
awkwardly It hurts me Lady Cranston to see you so upset

She looked at him for a moment in faint surprise

Nobody can do anything she bemoaned That is the unfortunate part of
it all

He rose to his feet and was immediately conscious as he always was when
he stood up that there was a foot or two of his figure which he had no
idea what to do with

You wouldnt feel like a ride tomorrow morning Lady Cranston he
asked with a wistfulness which seemed somehow stifled in his rather
unpleasant voice She shook her head

Perhaps one morning later she replied a little vaguely I havent
any heart for anything just now

He took a sombre but agitated leave of his hostess and went out into
the twilight cursing his lack of ease remembering the things which
he had meant to say and hating himself for having forgotten them
Philippa to whom his departure had been as it always was a relief
was already leaning forward in her chair with her arm around Helens
neck

I thought that extraordinary man would never go she exclaimed and
I was longing to send for you Helen London has been such a dreary
chapter of disappointments

What a sickening time you must have had dear

It was horrid Philippa assented sadly but you know Henry is no use
at all and I should have felt miserable unless I had gone I have been
to every friend at the War Office and every friend who has friends
there I have made every sort of enquiry and I know just as much now
as I did when I left herethat Richard was a prisoner at Wittenberg
the last time they heard and that they have received no notification
whatever concerning him for the last two months

Helen glanced at the calendar

It is just two months today she said mournfully since we heard

And then Philippa sighed he hadnt received a single one of our
parcels

Helen rose suddenly to her feet She was a tall fair girl of the best
Saxon type slim but not in the least angular with every promise
indeed of a fuller and more gracious development in the years to come
She was barely twentytwo years old and as is common with girls of her
complexion seemed younger Her bright intelligent face was above
all goodhumoured Just at that moment however there was a flush of
passionate anger in her cheeks

It makes me feel almost beside myself she exclaimed this hideous
incapacity for doing anything Here we are living in luxury without a
single privation whilst Dick the dearest thing on earth to both of us
is being starved and goaded to death in a foul German prison

We mustnt believe that its quite so bad as that dear Philippa
remonstrated What is it Mills

The elderly manservant who had entered with a tray in his band bowed
as he arranged it upon a side table

I have taken the liberty of bringing in a little fresh tea your
ladyship he announced and some hot buttered toast Cook has sent
some of the sandwiches too which your ladyship generally fancies

It is very kind of you Mills Philippa said with rather a wan little
smile I had some tea at South Lynn but it was very bad You might
take my coat please

She stood up and the heavy fur coat slipped easily away from her slim
elegant little body

Shall I light up your ladyship Mills enquired

You might light a lamp Philippa directed but dont draw the blinds
until lightingup time After the noise of London she went on
turning to Helen I always think that the faint sound of the sea is so
restful

The man moved noiselessly about the room and returned once more to his
mistress

We should be glad to hear your ladyship he said if there is any
news of Major Felstead Philippa shook her head

None at all I am sorry to say Mills Still we must hope for the
best I dare say that some of these camps are not so bad as we imagine

We must hope not your ladyship was the somewhat dismal reply Shall
I fasten the windows

You can leave them until you draw the blinds Mills Philippa
directed I am not at home if any one should call See that we are
undisturbed for a little time

Very good your ladyship

The door was closed and the two women were once more alone Philippa
held out her arms

Helen darling come and be nice to me she begged Let us both
pretend that no news is good news Oh I know what you are suffering
but remember that even if Dick is your lover he is my dear only
brothermy twin brother too We have been so much to each other all
our lives Hell stick it out dear if any human being can We shall
have him back with us some day

But he is hungry Helen sobbed I cant bear to think of his being
hungry Every time I sit down to eat it almost chokes me

I suppose he has forgotten what a whisky and soda is like Philippa
murmured with a little catch in her own throat

He always used to love one about this time Helen faltered glancing
at the clock

And cigarettes Philippa exclaimed I wonder whether they give him
anything to smoke

Nasty German tobacco if they do Helen rejoined indignantly And
to think that I have sent him at least six hundred of his favourite
Egyptians

She fell once more on her knees by her friends side Their arms were
intertwined their cheeks touching One of those strange feminine
silences of acute sympathy seemed to hold them for a while under its
thrall Then almost at the same moment a queer awakening came for both
of them Helens arm was stiffened Philippa turned her head but her
eyes were filled with incredulous fear A little current of cool air was
blowing through the room The French windows stood half open and with
his back to them a man who had apparently entered the room from the
gardens and passed noiselessly across the soft carpet was standing
by the door listening They heard him turn the key Then in a
businesslike manner he returned to the windows and closed them the
eyes of the two women following him all the time Satisfied apparently
with his precautions he turned towards them just as an expression of
indignant enquiry broke from Philippas lips Helen sprang to her feet
and Philippa gripped the sides of her chair The newcomer advanced a few
steps nearer to them



CHAPTER III


It seemed to the two women brief though the period of actual silence
was that in those few seconds they jointly conceived definite and
lasting impressions of the man who was to become during the next few
weeks an object of the deepest concern to both of them The intruder
was slightly built of little more than medium height of dark
complexion with an almost imperceptible moustache of military pattern
black hair dishevelled with the wind and eyes of almost peculiar
brightness He carried himself with an assurance which was somewhat
remarkable considering the condition of his torn and mud stained
clothes the very quality of which was almost undistinguishable They
both curiously enough formed the same instinctive conviction that
notwithstanding his tramplike appearance and his burglarious entrance
this was not a person to be greatly feared

The stranger brushed aside Philippas incoherent exclamation and opened
the conversation with some ceremony

Ladies he began with a low bow in the first place let me offer
my most profound apologies for this unusual form of entrance to your
house

Philippa rose from her easychair and confronted him The firelight
played upon her redgold hair and surprise had driven the weariness
from her face Against the black oak of the chimneypiece she had almost
the appearance of a framed cameo Her voice was quite steady although
its inflection betrayed some indignation

Will you kindly explain who you are and what you mean by this
extraordinary behaviour she demanded

It is my earnest intention to do so without delay he assured her his
eyes apparently rivetted upon Philippa Kindly pardon me

He held out his arm to stop Helen who with her eye upon the bell had
made a stealthy attempt to slip past him Her eyes flashed as she felt
his fingers upon her arm

How dare you attempt to stop me she exclaimed

My dear Miss Fairclough he remonstrated in the interests of all
of us it is better that we should have a few moments of undisturbed
conversation I am taking it for granted that I have the pleasure of
addressing Miss Fairclough

There was something about the mans easy confidence which was in its
way impressive yet irritating Helen appeared bereft of words and
retreated to her place almost mildly Philippas very delicate eyebrows
were drawn together in a slight frown

You are acquainted with our names then

Perfectly was the suave reply You I presume are Lady Cranston I
may be permitted to add he went on looking at her steadfastly that
the description from which I recognise you does you less than justice

I find that remark under the circumstances impertinent Philippa
told him coldly

He shrugged his shoulders There was a slight smile upon his lips and
his eyes twinkled

Alas he murmured for the moment I forgot the somewhat unusual
circumstances of our meeting Permit me to offer you what I trust you
will accept as the equivalent of a letter of introduction

A letter of introduction Philippa repeated glancing at his
disordered clothes and you come in through the window

Believe me the intruder assured her it was the only way

Perhaps you will tell me then Philippa demanded her anger gradually
giving way to bewilderment what is wrong with my front door

For all I know dear lady the newcomer confessed yours may be
an excellent front door I would ask you however to consider my
appearance I have been obliged to conclude the last few miles of my
journey in somewhat ignominious fashion My clothesthey were quite
nice clothes too when I started he added looking down at himself
ruefullyhave suffered And as you perceive I have lost my hat

Your hat Helen exclaimed with a sudden glance at Noras trophy

Precisely I might have posed before your butler perhaps as belonging
to what you call the hatless brigade but the mud upon my clothes
and these unfortunate rents in my garments would have necessitated an
explanation which I thought better avoided I make myself quite clear I
trust

Clear Philippa murmured helplessly

Clear Helen echoed with a puzzled frown

I mean of course their visitor explained so far as regards my
choosing this somewhat surreptitious form of entrance into your house

Philippa shrugged her shoulders and made a determined move towards the
bell The intruder however barred her way She looked up into his
face and found it difficult to maintain her indignation His expression
besides being distinctly pleasant was full of a respectful admiration

Will you please let me pass she insisted

Madam he replied I am afraid that it is your intention to ring the
bell

Of course it is she admitted Dont dare to prevent me

Madam I do not wish to prevent you he assured her A few moments
delaythat is all I plead for

Will you explain at once sir Philippa demanded what you mean by
forcing your way into my house in this extraordinary fashion and by
locking that door

I am most anxious to do so was the prompt reply I am correct of
course in my first surmise that you are Lady Cranstonand you Miss
Fairclough he added bowing ceremoniously to both of them A very
great pleasure I recognised you both quite easily you see from your
descriptions

From our descriptions Philippa repeated

The newcomer bowed

The descriptions glowing indeed but by no means exaggerated of your
brother Richard Lady Cranston and your fiance Miss Fairclough

Richard Philippa almost shrieked

You have seen Dick Helen gasped

The intruder dived in his pockets and produced two sealed envelopes He
handed one each simultaneously to Helen and to Philippa

My letters of introduction he explained with a little sigh of
relief I trust that during their perusal you will invite me to have
some tea I am almost starving

The two women hastened towards the lamp

One moment I beg their visitor interposed I have established I
trust my credentials May I remind you that I was compelled to ensure
the safety of these few minutes conversation with you by locking that
door Are you likely to be disturbed

No no No chance at all Philippa assured him

If we are well explain Helen promised

In that case the intruder begged perhaps you will excuse me

He moved towards the door and softly turned the key then he drew the
curtains carefully across the French windows Afterwards he made his way
towards the teatable A little throbbing cry had broken from Helens
lips

Philippa she exclaimed its from Dick Its Dicks handwriting

Philippas reply was incoherent She was tearing open her own envelope
With a wellsatisfied smile the bearer of these communications seized a
sandwich in one hand and poured himself out some tea with the other He
ate and drank with the restraint of goodbreeding but with a voracity
which gave point to his plea of starvation A few yards away the
breathless silence between the two women had given place to an almost
hysterical series of disjointed exclamations

Its from Dick Helen repeated Its his own dear handwriting How
shaky it is Hes alive and well Philippa and hes found a friend

I knowI know Philippa murmured tremulously Our parcels have been
discovered and he got them all at once Just fancy Helen hes really
not so ill after all

They drew a little closer together

You read yours out first Helen proposed and then Ill read mine

Philippa nodded Her voice here and there was a little uncertain

 MY DEAREST SISTER

 I have heard nothing from you or Helen for so long that I was
 really getting desperate I have had a very rough time here
 but by the grace of Providence I stumbled up against an old
 friend the other day Bertram Maderstrom whom you must have
 heard me speak of in my college days It isnt too much to say
 that he has saved my life He has unearthed your parcels found
 me decent quarters and I am getting double rations He has
 promised too to get this letter through to you

 You neednt worry about me now dear I am feeling twice the
 man I was a month ago and I shall stick it out now quite easily

 Write me as often as ever you can Your letters and Helens make
 all the difference

 My love to you and to Henry
 Your affectionate brother RICHARD

 PS Is Henry an Admiral yet I suppose he was in the Jutland
 scrap which they all tell us here was a great German victory I
 hope he came out all right

Philippa read the postscript with a little shiver Then she set her
teeth as though determined to ignore it

Isnt it wonderful she exclaimed turning towards Helen with glowing
eyes Now yours dear

Helens voice trembled as she read Her eyes too at times were misty

 DEAREST

 I am writing to you so differently because I feel that you will
 really get this letter I have bad an astonishing stroke of luck
 as you will gather from Philippas note You cant imagine the
 difference A month ago I really thought I should have to chuck
 it in Now I am putting on flesh every day and beginning to feel
 myself again I owe my life to a pal with whom I was at college
 and whom you and I dearest will have to remember all our lives

 I think of you always and my thoughts are like the flowers of
 which we see nothing in these hideous huts My greatest joy is
 in dreaming of the day when we shall meet again

 Write to me often sweetheart Your letters and my thoughts of
 you are the one joy of my life

 Always your lover
 DICK

There were a few moments of significant silence The girls were leaning
together their arms around one anothers necks their heads almost
touching Behind them their visitor continued to eat and drink He rose
at last however reluctantly to his feet and coughed They started
suddenly remembering his presence Philippa turned impulsively towards
him with outstretched hands

I cant tell you how thankful we are to you she declared

Both of us Helen echoed

He touched with his fingers a box of cigarettes which stood upon the
teatable

You permit he asked

Of course Philippa assented eagerly You will find some matches on
the tray there Do please help yourself I am afraid that I must have
seemed very discourteous but this has all been so amazing Wont you
have some fresh tea and some toast or wouldnt you like some more
sandwiches

Nothing more at present thank you he replied If you do not mind I
would rather continue our conversation

These letters are wonderful Philippa told him gratefully You know
from whom they come of course Dick is my twin brother and until the
war we had scarcely ever been parted Miss Fairclough here is engaged
to be married to him It is quite two months since we had a line and
I myself have been in London for the last three days three very weary
days making enquiries everywhere

I am very happy he said to have brought you such good news

Once more the normal aspect of the situation began to reimpose itself
upon the two women They remembered the locked door the secrecy of
their visitors entrance and his disordered condition

May I ask to whom we are indebted for this great service Philippa
enquired

My name for the present is Hamar Lessingham was the suave reply

For the present Philippa repeated You have perhaps some
explanations to make she went on with some hesitation the condition
of your clothes your somewhat curious form of entrance

With your permission

One moment Helen intervened eagerly Is it possible Mr Lessingham
that you have seen Major Felstead lately

A matter of fiftysix hours ago Miss Fairclough I am happy to tell
you that he was looking under the circumstances quite reasonably
well

Helen caught up a photograph from the table by her side and came over
to their visitors side

This was taken just before he went out the first time she continued
Is he anything like that now

Mr Hamar Lessingham sighed and shook his head

You must expect he warned her that prison and hospital have had
their effect upon him He was gaining strength every day however when
I left

Philippa held out her hand She had been looking curiously at their
visitor

Helen dear afterwards we will get Mr Lessingham to talk to us about
Dick she insisted First there are some questions which I must ask

He bowed slightly and drew himself up For a moment it seemed as though
they were entering upon a duelthe slight beautiful woman and the man
in rags

Just now she began you told us that you saw Major Felstead my
brother fiftysix hours ago

That is so he assented

But it is impossible she pointed out My brother is a prisoner of
war in Germany

Precisely he replied and not I am afraid under the happiest
conditions he has been unfortunate in his camp Let us talk about him
shall we

Are you mad Helen demanded or are you trying to confuse us

My dear young lady he protested Why suppose such a thing I was
flattering myself that my conversation and deportment were under the
circumstances perfectly rational

But you are talking nonsense Philippa insisted You say that you saw
Major Felstead fiftysix hours ago You cannot mean us to believe that
fiftysix hours ago you were at Wittenberg

That is precisely what I have been trying to tell you he agreed

But it isnt possible Helen gasped

Quite I assure you he continued in fact we should have been
here before but for a little uncertainty as to your armaments along the
coast There was a gun we were told somewhere near here which we were
credibly informed had once been fired without the slightest accident

Philippas eyes seemed to grow larger and rounder

Hes raving she decided

He isnt Helen cried with sudden divination Is that your hat she
asked pointing to the table where Nora had left her trophy

It is he admitted with a smile but I do not think that I will claim
it

You were in the observation car of that Zeppelin

Lessingham extended his hand

Softly please he begged You have I gather arrived at the
truth but for the moment shall it be our secret I made an exceedingly
uncomfortable not to say undignified descent from the Zeppelin which
passed over Dutchmans Common last night

Then Philippa cried you are a German

My dear lady I have escaped that misfortune Lessingham confessed
Do you think that none other than Germans ride in Zeppelins



CHAPTER IV


A new tenseness seemed to have crept into the situation The
conversation never without its emotional tendencies at once changed
its character Philippa cold and reserved with a threat lurking all
the time in her tone and manner became its guiding spirit

We may enquire your name she asked

I am the Baron Maderstrom was the prompt reply For the purpose of
my brief residence in this country however I fancy that the name of
Mr Hamar Lessingham might provoke less comment

Maderstrom Philippa repeated You were at Magdalen with my brother

For three terms he assented

You have visited at Wood Norton It was only an accident then that I
did not meet you

It is true he answered with a bow I received the most charming
hospitality there from your father and mother

Why you are the friend Helen exclaimed suddenly seizing his hands
of whom Dick speaks in his letter

It has been my great privilege to have been of service to Major
Felstead was the grave admission He and I during our college days
were more than ordinarily intimate I saw his name in one of the lists
of prisoners and I went at once to Wittenberg

A fresh flood of questions was upon Helens lips but Philippa brushed
her away

Please let me speak she said You have brought us these letters from
Richard for which we offer you our heartfelt thanks but you did
not risk your liberty perhaps your life to come here simply as
his ambassador There is something beyond this in your visit to this
country You may be a Swede but is it not true that at the present
moment you are in the service of an enemy

Lessingham bowed acquiescence

You are entirely right he murmured

Am I also right in concluding that you have some service to ask of us

Your directness dear lady moves me to admiration Lessingham assured
her I am here to ask a trifling favour in return for those which I
have rendered and those which I may yet render to your brother

And that favour

Their visitor looked down at his torn attire

A suit of your brothers clothes he replied and a room in which
to change The disposal of these rags I may leave I presume to your
ingenuity

Anything else

It is my wish he continued to remain in this neighbourhood for a
short timeperhaps a fortnight and perhaps a month I should value your
introduction to the hotel here and the extension of such hospitality as
may seem fitting to you under the circumstances

As Mr Hamar Lessingham

Beyond a doubt

There was a moments silence Philippas face had become almost stony
She took a step towards the telephone Lessingham however held out his
hand

Your purpose he enquired

I am going to ring up the Commandant here she told him and explain
your presence in this house

An heroic impulse he observed but too impulsive

We shall see she retorted Will you let me pass

His fingers restrained her as gently as possible

Let me make a reasonable appeal to both of you he suggested I am
here at your mercy I promise you that under no circumstances will I
attempt any measure of violence From any fear of that I trust my name
and my friendship with your brother will be sufficient guarantee

Continue then Philippa assented

You will give me ten minutes in which to state my case he begged

We must Helen exclaimed We must Philippa Please

You shall have your ten minutes Philippa conceded

He abandoned his attitude of watchfulness and moved back on to the
hearthrug his hands behind him He addressed himself to Philippa It
was Philippa who had become his judge

I will claim nothing from you he began for the services which I
have rendered to Richard Our friendship was a real thing and finding
him in such straits I would gladly under any circumstances have done
all that I have done I am well paid for this by the thanks which you
have already proffered me

No thanksnothing that we could do for you would be sufficient
recompense Helen declared energetically

Let me speak for a moment of the future he continued Supposing you
ring that telephone and hand me over to the authorities here Well that
will be the end of me without a doubt You will have done what seemed
to you to be the right thing and I hope that that consciousness will
sustain you for believe me though it may not be at my will your
brothers life will most certainly answer for mine

There was a slight pause A sob broke from Helens throat Even
Philippas lip quivered

Forgive me he went on if that sounds like a threat It was not so
meant It is the simple truth Let me hurry on to the future I ask so
little of you It is my duty to live in this spot for one month What
harm can I do You have no great concentration of soldiers here no
docks no fortifications no industry And in return for the slight
service of allowing me to remain here unmolested I pledge my word that
Richard shall be set at liberty and shall be here with you within two
months

Helens face was transformed her eyes glowed her lips were parted
with eagerness She turned towards Philippa her expression her whole
attitude an epitome of eloquent pleading

Philippa you will not hesitate You cannot

I must Philippa answered struggling with her agitation I love Dick
more dearly than anything else on earth but just now Helen we have to
remember before everything that we are English women We have to
put our human feelings behind us We are learning every day to make
sacrifices You too must learn dear My answer to you Baron
Maderstromor Mr Lessingham as you choose to call yourselfis no

Philippa you are mad Helen exclaimed passionately Didnt I have to
realise all that you say when I let Dick go cheerfully the day
after we were engaged Havent I realised the duty of cheerfulness and
sacrifice through all these weary months But there is a limit to
these things Philippa a sense of proportion which must be taken
into account Its Dicks life which is in the balance against some
intangible thing nothing that we could ever reproach ourselves with
nothing that could bring real harm upon any one Oh I love my country
too but I want Dick I should feel like his murderess all my life if I
didnt consent

It occurs to me Lessingham remarked turning towards Philippa that
Miss Faircloughs point of view is one to be considered

Doesnt all that Miss Fairclough has said apply to me Philippa
demanded with a little break in her voice Richard is my twin brother
he is the dearest thing in life to me Cant you realise though that
what you ask of us is treason

It really doesnt amount to that Lessingham assured her In my own
heart I feel convinced that I have come here on a fools errand No
object that I could possibly attain in this neighbourhood is worth the
life of a man like Richard Felstead

Oh hes right Helen exclaimed Think Philippa What is there here
which the whole world might not know There are no secrets in Dreymarsh
We are miles away from everywhere For my sake Philippa I implore you
not to be unreasonable

In plain words Lessingham intervened do not be quixotic Lady
Cranston There is just an idea on one side your brothers life on the
other You see the scales do not balance

Cant you realise though Philippa answered what that idea
means It is part of ones soul that one gives when one departs from a
principle

What are principles against love Helen demanded almost fiercely A
sister may prate about them Philippa A wife couldnt Id sacrifice
every principle I ever had every scrap of selfrespect myself and all
that belongs to me to save Dicks life

There was a brief throbbing silence Helen was feverishly clutching
Philippas hand Lessinghams eyes were fixed upon the tortured face
into which he gazed There were no women like this in his own country

Dear lady he said and for the first time his own voice shook I
abandon my arguments I beg you to act as you think best for your own
future happiness The chances of life or death are not great things for
either men like your brother or for me I would not purchase my end nor
he his life at the expense of your suffering You see I stand on one
side The telephone is there for your use

You shant use it Helen cried passionately Phillipa you shant

Philippa turned towards her and all the stubborn pride had gone out of
her face Her great eyes were misty with tears her mouth was twitching
with emotion She threw her arms around Helens neck

My dear I cant I cant she sobbed



CHAPTER V


Philippas breakdown was only momentary With a few brusque words
she brought the other two down to the level of her newly recovered
equanimity

To be practical she began we have no time to lose I will go
and get a suit of Dicks clothes and Helen you had better take Mr
Lessingham into the gun room Afterwards perhaps you will have time to
ring up the hotel

Lessingham took a quick step towards heralmost as though he were
about to make some impetuous withdrawal Philippa turned and met
his almost pleading gaze Perhaps she read there his instinct of
selfabnegation

I am in command of the situation she continued a little more
lightly Every one must please obey me I shant be more than five
minutes

She left the room waving back Lessinghams attempt to open the door for
her He stood for a moment looking at the place where she had vanished
Then he turned round

Major Felsteads description he said quietly did not do his sister
justice

Philippa is a dear Helen declared enthusiastically Just for a
moment though I was terrified She has a wonderful will

How long has she been married

About six years

Are thereany children

Helen shook her head

Sir Henry had a daughter by his first wife who lives with us

Six years Lessingham repeated Why she seems no more than a child
Sir Henry must be a great deal her senior

Sixteen years Helen told him Philippa is twentynine And now
dont be inquisitive any more please and come with me I want to show
you where to change your clothes

She opened a door on the other side of the room and pointed to a small
apartment across the passage

If youll wait in there she begged Ill bring the clothes to you
directly they come I am going to telephone now

So many thanks he answered I should like a pleasant bedroom and
sitting room and a bathroom if possible My luggage you will find
already there A friend in London has seen to that

She looked at him curiously

You are very thorough arent you she remarked

The people of the country whom it is my destiny to serve all are he
replied One weak link you know may sometimes spoil the mightiest
chain

She closed the door and took up the telephone

Number three please she began Are you the hotel The manager
Good I am speaking for Lady Cranston She wishes a sittingroom
bedroom and bathroom reserved for a friend of ours who is arriving
todaya Mr Hamar Lessingham You have his luggage already I believe
Please do the best you can for himCertainlyThank you very much

She set down the receiver The door was quickly opened and shut
Philippa reappeared carrying an armful of clothes

Why youve brought his grey suit Helen cried in dismay the one he
looks so well in

Dont be an idiot Philippa scoffed I had to bring the first I could
find Take them in to Mr Lessingham and for heavens sake see that he
hurries Henrys train is due and he may be here at any moment

Ill tell him Helen promised Ill smuggle him out of the back way
if you like

Philippa laughed a little drearily

A nice start that would be if any one ever traced his arrival she
observed No we must try and get him away before Henry comes but if
the worst comes to the worst well have him in and introduce him Henry
isnt likely to notice anything she added a little bitterly

Helen disappeared with the clothes and returned almost immediately
Philippa was sitting in her old position by the fire

Youre not worrying about this dear are you the former asked
anxiously

I dont know Philippa replied without turning her head I dont
know what may come of it Helen I have a queer sort of feeling about
that man

Helen sighed I suppose she confessed I am the narrowest person on
earth I can think of one thing and one thing only If Mr Lessingham
keeps his word Dick will be here perhaps in a month perhaps six
weekscertainly soon

He will keep his word Philippa said quietly He is that sort of
man

The door on the other side of the room was softly opened Lessinghams
head appeared

Could I have a necktie he asked diffidently Philippa stretched out
her hand and took one from the basket by her side

Better give him this she said handing it over to Helen It is one
of Henrys which I was mendingStop

She put up her finger They all listened

The car Philippa exclaimed rising hastily to her feet That is
Henry Go out with Mr Lessingham Helen she continued and wait
until he is ready Dont forget that he is an ordinary caller and bring
him in presently

Helen nodded understandingly and hurried out

Philippa moved a few steps towards the other door In a moment it was
thrown open Nora appeared with her arm through her fathers

I went to meet him Mummy she explained No uniformisnt it a
shame

Sir Henry patted her cheek and turned to greet his wife There was
a shadow upon his bronzed handsome face as he watched her rather
hesitating approach

Sorry I couldnt catch your train Phil he told her I had to make a
call in the city so I came down from Liverpool Street Any luck

She held his hands resisting for the moment his proffered embrace

Henry she said earnestly do you know I am so much more anxious to
hear your news

Mine will keep he replied What about Richard

She shook her head

I spent the whole of my time making enquiries she sighed and every
one was fruitless I failed to get the least satisfaction from any one
at the War Office They know nothing have heard nothing

Im ever so sorry to hear it Sir Henry declared sympathetically You
mustnt worry too much though dear Wheres Helen

She is in the gun room with a caller

With a caller Nora exclaimed Is it any one from the Depot I must
go and see

You neednt trouble her stepmother replied Here they are coming
in

The door on the opposite side of the room was suddenly opened and Hamar
Lessingham and Helen entered together Lessingham was entirely at his
easetheir conversation indeed seemed almost engrossing He came at
once across the room on realising Sir Henrys presence

This is Mr Hamar Lessinghammy husband Philippa said Mr
Lessingham was at college with Dick Henry so of course Helen and he
have been indulging in all sorts of reminiscences

The two men shook hands

I found time also to examine your Leech prints Lessingham remarked
You have some very admirable examples

Quite a hobby of mine in my younger days Sir Henry admitted One
or two of them are very good I believe Are you staying in these parts
long Mr Lessingham

Perhaps for a week or two was the somewhat indifferent reply I am
told that this is the most wonderful air in the world so I have come
down here to pull up again after a slight illness

A dreary spot just now Sir Henry observed but the airs all right
Are you a seafisherman by any chance Mr Lessingham

I have done a little of it the visitor confessed Sir Henrys face
lit up He drew from his pocket a small brown paper parcel

I dont mind telling you he confided as he cut the string that I
dont think theres another sport like it in the world I have tried
most of them too When I was a boy I was all for shooting perhaps
because I could never get enough Then I had a season or two at Melton
though I was never much of a horseman But for real unadulterated
excitement for sport that licks everything else into a cocked hat give
me a strong sea rod a couple of traces just enough sea to keep on the
bottom all the time and the codling biting Look here did you ever see
a mackerel spinner like that he added drawing one out of the parcel
which he had untied Look at it all of you

Lessingham took it gingerly in his fingers Philippa a little
ostentatiously turned her back upon the two men and took up a
newspaper

Lady Cranston does not sympathize with my interest in any sort of sport
just now Sir Henry explained goodhumouredly All the same I argue
that one must keep ones mind occupied somehow or other

Quite right Dad Nora agreed We must carry on as the Colonel says
All the same I did hope youd come down in a new naval uniform with
lots of gold braid on your sleeve I think they might have made you an
admiral Daddy youd look so nice on the bridge

I am afraid her father replied with his eyes glued upon the spinner
which Lessingham was holding that that is a consideration which didnt
seem to weigh with them much Look at the glitter of it he went on
taking up another of the spinners You see its got a double swivel
and they guarantee six hundred revolutions a minute

I must plead ignorance Lessingham regretted of everything connected
with mackerel spinning

Its fine sport for a change Sir Henry declared The only thing is
that if you strike a shoal one gets tired of hauling the beggars in
Bytheby has Jimmy been up for me Philippa Have you heard whether
there are any mackerel in

Philippa raised her eyebrows

Mackerel she repeated sarcastically

Have you any objection to the fish dear Sir Henry enquired blandly

Philippa made no reply Her husband frowned and turned towards
Lessingham

You see he complained a little irritably my wife doesnt approve of
my taking an interest even in fishing while the wars on but hang it
all what are you to do when you reach my age Thinks I ought to be a
special constable dont you Philippa

Need we discuss this before Mr Lessingham she asked without looking
up from her paper

Lessingham promptly prepared to take his departure

See something more of you I hope Sir Henry remarked hospitably as
he conducted his guest to the door Where are you staying here

At the hotel

Which

I did not understand that there was more than one Lessingham replied
I simply wrote to The Hotel Dreymarsh

There is only one hotel open of course Mr Lessingham Philippa
observed turning towards him Why do you ask such an absurd question
Henry The Grand is full of soldiers Come and see us whenever you
feel inclined Mr Lessingham

I shall certainly take advantage of your permission Lady Cranston
were the farewell words of this unusual visitor as he bowed himself out

Sir Henry moved to the sideboard and helped himself to a whisky and
soda Philippa laid down her newspaper and watched him as though waiting
patiently for his return Helen and Nora had already obeyed the summons
of the dressing bell

Henry I want to hear your news she insisted He threw himself into
an easychair and turned over the contents of Philippas workbasket

Wheres that tie of mine you were mending he asked Is it finished
yet

It is upstairs somewhere she replied No I have not finished it
Why do you ask You have plenty havent you

Drawers full he admitted cheerfully Half of them I can never wear
though I like that black and white fellow Your friend Lessingham was
wearing one exactly like it

It isnt exactly an uncommon pattern Philippa reminded him

Seems to have the family taste in clothes Sir Henry continued
stroking his chin That grey tweed suit of his was exactly the same
pattern as the suit Richard was wearing the last time I saw him in
mufti

They probably go to the same tailor Philippa remarked equably

Sir Henry abandoned the subject He was once more engrossed in an
examination of the mackerel spinners

You didnt answer my question about Jimmy Dumble he ventured
presently

Philippa turned and looked at him Her eyes were usually very sweet and
soft and her mouth delightful Just at that moment however there were
new and very firm lines in her face

Henry she said sternly you are purposely fencing with me Mr
Lessinghams taste in clothes or Jimmy Dumbles comings and goings are
not what I want to hear or talk about You went to London unwillingly
enough to keep your promise to me I want to know whether you have
succeeded in getting anything from the Admiralty

Nothing but the cold shoulder my dear he answered with a little
chuckle

Do you mean to say that they offered you nothing at all she
persisted You may have been out of the service too long for them to
start you with a modern ship but surely they could have given you an
auxiliary cruiser or a secondary command of some sort

They didnt even offer me a washtub dear he confessed My names on
a list they said

Oh that list Philippa interrupted angrily Henry I really cant
bear it Couldnt they find you anything on land

My dear girl he replied a little testily what sort of a figure
should I cut in an office No one can read my writing and I couldnt
add up a column of figures to save my life What is it he added as
the door opened and Mills made his appearance

Dumble is here to see you sir

Show him in at once his master directed with alacrity Come in
Jimmy he went on raising his voice Ive got something to show you
here

Philippas lips were drawn a little closer together She swept past her
husband on her way to the door

I hope you will be so good she said looking back as to spare me
half an hour of your valuable time this evening This is a subject which
I must discuss with you further at once

As urgent as all that eh Sir Henry replied stopping to light a
cigarette Righto You can have the whole of my evening dear with the
greatest of pleasureNow then Jimmy



CHAPTER VI


Jimmy Dumble possessed a very red face and an extraordinary capacity for
silence He stood a yard or two inside the room twirling his hat in
his hand Sir Henry after the closing of the door did not for a moment
address his visitor There was a subtle but unmistakable change in his
appearance as he stood with his hands in his pockets and a frown on
his forehead whistling softly to himself his eyes fixed upon the door
through which his wife had vanished He swung round at last towards the
telephone

Stand by for a moment Jimmy will you he directed

Aye aye sir

Sir Henry took up the receiver He dropped his voice a little although
it was none the less distinct

Number onepolicestation pleaseHullo there The inspector
aboutThat you InspectorSir Henry Cranston speaking Could you
just step roundGood Tell them to show you straight into the library
You might just drop a hint to Mills about the lights eh Thank you

He laid down the receiver and turned towards the fisherman

Well Jimmy he enquired all serene down in the village eh

So far as Ive seen or heard sir there aint been a word spoke as
shouldnt be

A lazy lot they are Sir Henry observed

They dont look far beyond the end of their noses

Maybe its as well for us sir as they dont was the cautious reply

Sir Henry strolled to the further end of the room

Perhaps you are right Jimmy he admitted

That fellow Ben Oates seems to be the only one with ideas

He dont keep sober long enough to give us any trouble Dumble
declared He began asking me questions a few days ago and I know he
put Grices lad on to find out which way we went last Saturday week
but that dont amount to anything He was dead drunk for three days
afterwards

Sir Henry nodded

Im not very frightened of Ben Oates Jimmy he confided as he threw
open the door of a large cabinet which stood against the further wall
No strangers about eh

Not a sign of one sir

Sir Henry glanced towards the door and listened

Shall I just give the key a turn sir his visitor asked

I dont think it is necessary Sir Henry replied Theyve all gone up
to change Now listen to me Jimmy

He leaned forward and touched a spring The false back of the cabinet
with its little array of flies spinners fishing hooks and tackle
slowly rolled back Before them stood a huge chart wonderfully executed
in red white and yellow

Thats a marvellous piece of work sir the fisherman observed
admiringly

Best thing I ever did in my life Sir Henry agreed Now see here
Jimmy Well sail out tomorrow or take the motor boat according to the
wind Well enter Langley Shallows there and pass Dead Mans Rock on the
left side of the waterway and keep straight on until we get Budden Wood
on the church tower You follow me

Aye aye sir

We make for the headland from there You see we shall be outside the
Gidney Shallows and number twelve will pick us up Put all the fishing
tackle in the boat and dont forget the bait We must never lose sight
of the fact Jimmy that the main object of our lives is to catch fish

Thats right sir was the hearty assent

Well be off at seven oclock sharp then Sir Henry decided

The tidell be on the flow by that time Jimmy observed and well
get off from the staith breakwater That do be a fine piece of work and
no mistake he added as the false back of the cabinet glided slowly to
its place

Sir Henry chuckled

Its nothing to the one Ive got on number twelve Jimmy he said
Ive got the seaweed on that pretty well Youll take a drop of whisky
on your way out he added Mills will look after you

I thank you kindly sir

Mills answered the bell with some concern in his face

The inspector is here to see you sir he announced He did mention
something about the lights Im sure weve all been most careful Even
her ladyship has only used a candle in her bedroom

Show the inspector in Sir Henry directed and Ill hear what he has
to say And give Dumble some whisky as he goes out and a cigar

Wishing you good night sir the latter said as he followed Mills
Ill be punctual in the morning Looks to me as though we might have
good sport

Well hope for it anyway Jimmy his employer replied cheerfully
Come in Inspector

The inspector a tall broadshouldered man saluted and stood at
attention Sir Henry nodded affably and glanced towards the door He
remained silent until Mills and Dumble had disappeared

Glad I happened to catch you Inspector he observed sitting on the
edge of the table and helping himself to another cigarette Any fresh
arrivals

None sir the man reported of any consequence that I can see There
are two more young officers for the Depot and the young lady for the
Grange and Mr and Mrs Silvester returned home last night There was
a commercial traveller came in the first train this morning but he went
on during the afternoon

Hm What about a Mr Lessinghama Mr Hamar Lessingham

I havent heard of him sir

Have you had the registration papers down from the hotel yet

Not this evening sir I met the Midland and Great Northern train in
myself Her ladyship was the only passenger to alight here

And I came the other way myself Sir Henry reflected

Now you come to mention the matter sir the inspector continued
I was up at the hotel this afternoon and I saw some luggage about
addressed to a name somewhat similar to that

Probably sent on in advance eh

There could be no other way sir the inspector replied unless the
registration paper has been mislaid Ill step up to the hotel this
evening and make sure

Youll oblige me very much if you will By Jove Sir Henry added
looking towards the door Id no idea it was so late

Philippa who had changed her travelling dress for a plain black net
gown was standing in the doorway She looked at the inspector and for
a moment the little colour which she had seemed to disappear

Is anything the matter she asked breathlessly

Nothing in the world my dear her husband assured her I am
frightfully sorry Im so late Jimmy stayed some time and then the
inspector here looked in about our lights Just a little more care in
this room at night he thinks Well see to it Inspector

I am very much obliged sir the man replied Sorry to be under the
necessity of mentioning it

Sir Henry opened the door

Youll find your own way out wont you he begged Im a little
late

The inspector saluted and withdrew Sir Henry glanced round

I wont be ten minutes Philippa he promised I had no idea it was
so late

Come here one moment please she insisted

He came back into the room and stood on the other side of the small
table near which she had paused

What is it dear he enquired We are going to leave our talk till
after dinner arent we

She looked him in the face There was an anxious light in her eyes and
she was certainly not herself Of course I only wanted to knowit
seemed to me that you broke off in what you were saying to the
inspector as I came into the room Are you sure that it was the lights
he came around about There isnt anything else wrong is there

What else could there be he asked wonderingly

I have no idea she replied with wellsimulated indifference I was
only asking you whether there was anything else

He shook his head

Nothing

She threw herself into an easychair and picked up a magazine

Thank you she said Do hurry please I have a new cook and she
asked particularly whether we were punctual people

Six minutes will see me through it Sir Henry promised making for the
door Come to think of it I missed my lunch I think Ill manage it in
five



CHAPTER VII


Sir Henry was in a pleasant and expansive humour that evening The new
cook was an unqualified success and he was conscious of having dined
exceedingly well He sat in a comfortable easychair before a blazing
wood fire he had just lit one of his favourite brand of cigarettes and
his wife whom he adored was seated only a few feet away

Quite a remarkable change in Helen he observed She was in the
depths of depression when I went away and tonight she seems positively
cheerful

Helen varies a great deal Philippa reminded him

Still tonight I must say I should have expected to have found her
more depressed than ever Sir Henry went on She hoped so much from
your trip to London and you apparently accomplished nothing

Nothing at all

And you have had no letters

None

Then Helens high spirits I suppose are only part of womans natural
inconsistencyPhilippa dear

Yes

I am glad to be at home I am glad to see you sitting there I know you
are nursing up something some little thunderbolt to launch at me Wont
you launch it and lets get it over

Philippa laid down the book which she had been reading and turned to
face her husband He made a little grimace

Dont look so severe he begged You frighten me before you begin

Im sorry she said but my face probably reflects my feelings I am
hurt and grieved and disappointed in you Henry

Thats a good start anyway he groaned

We have been married six years Philippa went on and I admit at once
that I have been very happy Then the war came You know quite well
Henry that especially at that time I was very very fond of you yet
it never occurred to me for a moment but that like every other woman I
should have to lose my husband for a timeStop please she insisted
as he showed signs of interrupting I know quite well that it was
through my persuasions you retired so early but in those days there was
no thought of war and I always had it in my mind that if trouble came
you would find your way back to where you belonged

But my dear child that is all very well Sir Henry protested but
its not so easy to get back again You know very well that I went up to
the Admiralty and offered my services directly the war started

Yes and what happened Philippa demanded You were in a measure
shelved You were put on a list and told that you would hear from
thema sort of Micawberlike situation with which you were perfectly
satisfied Then you took that moor up in Scotland and disappeared for
nearly six months

I was supplying the starving population with food he reminded her
genially We sent about four hundred brace of grouse to market not to
speak of the salmon We had some very fair golf too some of the time

Oh I have not troubled to keep any exact account of your diversions
Philippa said scornfully Sometimes she continued I wonder whether
you are quite responsible Henry How you can even talk of these things
when every man of your age and strength is fighting one way or another
for his country seems marvellous to me Do you realise that we are
fighting for our very existence Do you realise that my own father who
is fifteen years older than you is in the firing line This is a small
place of course but there isnt a man left in it of your age with
your physique who has had the slightest experience in either service
who isnt doing something

I cant do more than send in applications he grumbled Be
reasonable my dear Philippa It isnt the easiest thing in the world to
find a job for a sailor who has been out of it as long as I have

So you say but when they ask me what you are doing as they all did
in London this time and I reply that you cant get a job there is
generally a polite little silence No one believes it I dont believe
it

Philippa

Sir Henry turned in his chair His cigar was burning now idly between
his fingers His heavy eyebrows were drawn together

Well I dont she reiterated You can be angry if you willin
fact I think I should prefer you to be angry You take no pains at
the Admiralty You just go there and come away again once a year or
something like that Why if I were you I wouldnt leave the place
until theyd found me somethingindoors or outdoors what does it
matter so long as your hand is on the wheel and you are doing your
little for your country But youwhat do you care You went to town
to get a joband you come back with new mackerel spinners You are off
fishing tomorrow morning with Jimmy Dumble Somewhere up in the North
Sea today and tomorrow and the next day men are giving their lives
for their country What do you care You will sit there smoking your
pipe and catching dabs

Do you know you are almost offensive Philippa her husband said
quietly

I want to be she retorted I should like you to feel that I am In
any case this will probably be the last conversation I shall hold with
you on the subject

Well thank God for that anyway he observed strolling to the
chimneypiece and selecting a pipe from a rack I think youve said
about enough

I havent finished she told him ominously

Then for heavens sake get on with it and lets have it over he
begged

Oh youre impossible Philippa exclaimed bitterly Listen I give
you one chance more Tell me the truth Is there anything in your
health of which I do not know Is there any possible explanation of your
extraordinary behaviour which for some reason or other you have kept
to yourself Give me your whole confidence

Sir Henry for a moment was serious enough He stood looking down at
her a little wistfully

My dear he told her I have nothing to say except this You are my
very precious wife I have loved you and trusted you since the day of
our marriage I am content to go on loving and trusting you even though
things should come under my notice which I do not understand Cant you
accept me the same way

Philippa momentarily uneasy was nevertheless rebellious

Accept you the same way How can I There is nothing in my life to
compare in any way with the tragedy of your

She paused as though unwilling to finish the sentence He waited
patiently however for her to proceed

Of my what

Philippa compromised

Lethargy she pronounced triumphantly

An excellent word he murmured

It is too mild a one but you are my husband she remarked

That reminds me he said quietly You are my wife

I know it she admitted but I am also a woman and there are limits
to my endurance If you can give me no explanation of your behaviour
Henry if you really have no intention of changing it then there is
only one course left open for me

That sounds rather alarmingwhat is it he demanded

Philippa lifted her head a little This was the pronouncement towards
which she had been leading

From today she declared I cease to be your wife

His fingers paused in the manipulation of the tobacco with which he was
filling his pipe He turned and looked at her

You what

I cease to be your wife

How do you manage that he asked

Dont jest she begged It hurts me so What I mean is surely plain
enough I will continue to live under your roof if you wish it or I
am perfectly willing to go back to Wood Norton I will continue to bear
your name because I must but the other ties between us are finished

You dont mean this Philippa he said gravely

But I do mean it she insisted I mean every word I have spoken So
far as I am concerned Henry this is your last chance

There was a knock at the door Mills entered with a note upon a salver
Sir Henry took it up glanced questioningly at his wife and tore open
the envelope

There will be no answer Mills he said

The man withdrew Sir Henry read the few lines thoughtfully

 Policestation Dreymarsh
 SIR

 According to enquiries made I find that Mr Hamar Lessingham
 arrived at the Hotel this evening in time for dinner His
 luggage arrived by rail yesterday It is presumed that he came
 by motorcar but there is no car in the garage nor any mention
 of one His room was taken for him by Miss Fairclough ringing
 up for Lady Cranston about seven oclock

 Respectfully yours
 JOHN HAYLOCK

Is your note of interest Philippa enquired

In a sense yes he replied thrusting it into his waistcoat pocket
I presume we can consider our late subject of conversation finished
with

I have nothing more to say she pronounced

Very well then her husband agreed let us select another topic
This time supposing I choose

You are welcome

Let us converse then about Mr Hamar Lessingham

Philippa had taken up her work Her fingers ceased their labours but
she did not look up

About Mr Hamar Lessingham she repeated Rather a limited subject I
am afraid

I am not so sure he said thoughtfully For instance who is he

I have no idea she replied Does it matter He was at college with
Richard and he has been a visitor at Wood Norton That is all that
we know Surely it is sufficient for us to offer him any reasonable
hospitality

I am not disputing it Sir Henry assured her On the face of it it
seems perfectly reasonable that you should be civil to him On the other
hand there are one or two rather curious points about his coming here
just now

Really Philippa murmured indifferently bending a little lower over
her work

In the first place her husband continued how did he arrive here

For all I know she replied he may have walked

A little unlikely Still he didnt come from London by either of the
evening trains and it seems that you didnt take his rooms for him
until about seven oclock before which time he hadnt been to the
hotel So you see one is driven to wonder how the mischief he did get
here

I took his rooms Philippa repeated with a sudden little catch at her
heart

Some one from here rang up didnt they Sir Henry went on carelessly
I gathered that we were introducing him at the hotel

Where did you hear that she demanded

He shrugged his shoulders but avoided answering the question

I have no doubt he continued that the whole subject of Mr Hamar
Lessingham is scarcely worth discussing Yet he does seem to have
arrived here under a little halo of coincidence

I am afraid I have scarcely appreciated that Philippa remarked in
fact his coming here has seemed to me the most ordinary thing in the
world After all although one scarcely remembers that since the war
this is a health resort and the man has been ill

Quite right Sir Henry agreed You are not going to bed dear

Philippa had folded up her work She stood for a moment upon the
hearthrug The little hardness which had tightened her mouth had
disappeared her eyes had softened

May I say just one word more she begged about our previousour
only serious subject of conversation I have tried my best since we were
married Henry to make you happy

You know quite well he assured her that you have succeeded

Grant me one favour then she pleaded Give up your fishing
expedition tomorrow go back to London by the first train and let me
write to Lord Rayton I am sure he would do something for you

Of course hed do something Her husband groaned I should get a
censorship in Ireland or a post as instructor at Portsmouth

Wouldnt you rather take either of those than nothing she asked
than go on living the life you are living now

To be perfectly frank with you Philippa I wouldnt he declared
bluntly What on earth use should I be in a land appointment Why no
one could read my writing and my nautical science is entirely out of
date Why a cadet at Osborne could floor me in no time

You refuse to let me write then she persisted

Absolutely

You intend to go on that fishing expedition with Jimmy Dumble
tomorrow

Wouldnt miss it for anything he confessed

Philippa was suddenly white with anger

Henry Ive finished she declared holding out her hand to keep
him away from her Ive finished with you entirely I would rather be
married to an enemy who was fighting honourably for his country than to
you What I have said I mean Dont come near me Dont try to touch
me

She swept past him on her way to the door

Not even a goodnight kiss he asked stooping down

She looked him in the eyes

I am not a child she said scornfully

He closed the door after her For a moment he remained as though
undecided whether to follow or not His face had softened with her
absence Finally however he turned away with a little shrug of
the shoulders threw himself into his easychair and began to smoke
furiously

The telephone bell disturbed his reflection He rose at once and took up
the receiver

Yes this is 19 Dreymarsh Trunk call All right I am here

He waited until another voice came to him faintly

Cranston

Speaking

Thats right The message is Odino Berry you understand Odino
berry

Ive got it Sir Henry replied Good night He hung up the receiver
crossed the room to his desk unlocked one of the drawers and produced
a black memorandum book secured with a brass lock He drew a key from
his watch chain opened the book and ran his fingers down the Os

Odino he muttered to himself Here it is We have trustworthy
information from Berlin Now Berry He turned back You are being
watched by an enemy secret service agent

He relocked the cipher book and replaced it in the desk Then he
strolled over to his easychair and helped himself to a whisky and soda
from the tray which Mills had just arranged upon the sideboard

We have trustworthy information from Berlin he repeated to himself
that you are being watched by an enemy secret service agent



CHAPTER VIII


Tell me Mr Lessingham Philippa insisted exactly what are you
thinking of You looked so dark and mysterious from the ridge below that
Ive climbed up on purpose to ask you

Lessingham held out his hand to steady her They were standing on
a sharp spur of the cliffs the north wind blowing in their faces
thrashing into little flecks of white foam the sea below on which the
twilight was already resting For a moment or two neither of them could
speak

I was thinking of my country he confessed I was looking through the
shadows there right across the North Sea

To Germany

He shook his head

Further awayto Sweden

I forgot she murmured You looked as though you were posing for a
statue of some one in exile she observed Come let us go a little
lower downunless you want to stay here and be blown to pieces

I was on my way back to the hotel he answered quickly as he followed
her lead but to tell you the truth I was feeling a little lonely

That she declared is your own fault I asked you to come to
Mainsail Haul whenever you felt inclined

As I have felt inclined ever since the evening I arrived he remarked
with a smile you might perhaps by this time have had a little too
much of me

On the contrary she told him I quite expected you yesterday
afternoon to tell me how you like the place and what you have been
doing So you were thinking aboutover there she added moving her
head seawards

Over there absorbs a great deal of ones thoughts he confessed and
the rest of them have been playing me queer tricks

Well I should like to hear about the first half she insisted

Do you know he replied there are times when even now this war seems
to me like an unreal thing like something I have been reading about
some wild imagining of Shelley or one of the unrestrainable poets I
cant believe that millions of the flower of Germanys manhood and
yours have perished helplessly hopelessly cruelly And Francepoor
decimated France

Well Germany started the war you know she reminded him

Did she he answered I sometimes wonder Even now I fancy if the
official papers of every one of the nations lay side by side with their
own case stated from their own point of view even you might feel a
little confused about that Still I am going to be very honest with
you I think myself that Germany wanted war

There you are then she declared triumphantly The whole thing is
her responsibility

I do not quite go so far as that he protested You see the world is
governed by great natural laws As a snowball grows larger with rolling
so it takes up more room As a child grows out of its infant clothes it
needs the vestments of a youth and then a man And so with Germany She
grew and grew until the country could not hold her children until her
banks could not contain her money until she stretched her arms out on
every side and felt herself stifled Germany came late into the world
and found it parcelled out but had she not a right to her place She
made herself great She needed space

Well Philippa observed you couldnt suppose that other nations
were going to give up what they had just because she wanted their
possessions could you

Perhaps not he admitted And yet you see the immutable law comes
in here The stronger must possessnot only the stronger by arms
mind but by intellect by learning by proficiency in science by
utilitarianism The really cruel part the part I was thinking of then
as I looked out across the sea is that this crude and miserable resort
to arms should be necessary

If only Germans themselves were as broadminded and reasonable as
you Philippa sighed one feels that there might be some hope for the
future

I am not alone he assured her but you see all over Germany there
is spread like a spiders web the lay religion of the citizendevotion
to the Government blind obedience to the Kaiser Independent thought
has made Germany great in science in political economy in economics
But independent thought is never turned towards her political destinies
Those are shaped for her For good or for evil her children have learnt
obedience

They were descending the hillside now At their feet lay the little
town black and silent

You have helped me to understand a little Philippa said You put
things so gently and yet so clearly Now tell me will you not how it
is that you who are a Swede by birth are bearing arms for Germany

That is very simple he confessed My mother was a German and when
she died she bequeathed to me large estates in Bavaria and a very
considerable fortune These I could never have inherited unless I
had chosen to do my military service in Germany My family is an
impoverished one and I have brothers and sisters dependent upon me
Under the circumstances hesitation on my part was impossible

But when the war came she queried

He looked at her in surprise

What was there left for me then he demanded Naturally I heard
nothing but the voice of those whom I had sworn to obey I was in that
mad rush through Belgium I was wounded at Maubeuge or else I should
have followed hard on the heels of that wonderful retreat of yours
As it was I lay for many months in hospital I joined againshall I
confess italmost unwillingly The bloodthirstiness of it all sickened
me I fought at Ypres but I think that it was something of the courage
of despair of black misery I was wounded again and decorated I
suppose I shall never be fit for the front again I tried to turn to
account some of my knowledge of England and English life Then they sent
me here

Here of all places in the world Philippa repeated wonderingly
Just look at us We have a single line of railway a perfectly
straightforward system of roads the ordinary number of soldiers being
trained no mysteries no industriesnothing What terrible scheme are
you at work upon Mr Lessingham

He smiled

Between you and me he confided I am not at all sure that I am not
here on a fools errandat least I thought so when I arrived

She glanced up at him

And why not now

He made no answer but their eyes met and Philippa looked hurriedly
away There was a moments queer strained silence Before them loomed
up the outline of Mainsail Haul

You will come in and have some tea wont you she invited

If I may Believe me he added it has only been a certain diffidence
that has kept me away so long

She made no reply and they entered the house together They found Helen
and Nora with three or four young men from the Depot having tea in the
drawingroom Lessingham slipped very easily into the pleasant little
circle If a trifle subdued his quiet manners and a sense of humour
which every now and then displayed itself were most attractive

Wish youd come and dine with us and meet our colonel sir Harrison
asked him He was at Magdalen a few years after Major Felstead and I
am sure youd find plenty to talk about

I am quite sure that we should Lessingham replied May I come
perhaps towards the end of next week I am making most strenuous
efforts to lead an absolutely quiet life here

Whenever you like sir We shant be able to show you anything very
wild in the way of dissipation Vintage port and a decent cigar are the
only changes we can make for guests

Philippa drew her visitor on one side presently and made him sit with
her in a distant corner of the room

I knew there was something I wanted to say to you she began but
somehow or other I forgot when I met you My husband was very much
struck with Helens improved spirits Dont you think that we had better
tell him when he returns that we had heard from Major Felstead

Lessingham agreed

Just let him think that your letters came by post in the ordinary way
he advised I shouldnt imagine from what I have seen of your husband
that he is a suspicious person but it is just possible that he might
have associated them with me if you had mentioned them the other night
When is he coming back

I never know Philippa answered with a sigh Perhaps tonight
perhaps in a week It depends upon what sport he is having You are not
smoking

Lessingham lit a cigarette

I find your husband he said quietly rather an interesting type We
have no one like that in Germany He almost puzzles me

Philippa glanced up to find her companions dark eyes fixed upon her

There is very little about Henry that need puzzle any one she
complained bitterly He is just an overgrown spoilt child devoted to
amusements and following his fancy wherever it leads him Why do
you look at me Mr Lessingham as though you thought I was keeping
something back I am not I can assure you

Perhaps I was wondering he confessed how you really felt towards a
husband whose outlook was so unnatural

She looked down at her intertwined fingers

Do you know she said softly I feel somehow or other although we
have known one another such a short time as though we were friends
and yet that is a question which I could not answer A woman must always
have some secrets you know

A man may try sometimes to preserve his he sighed but a woman is
clever enough as a rule to dig them out

A faint tinge of colour stole into her cheeks She welcomed Helens
approach almost eagerly

A woman must first feel the will she murmured without glancing at
him Helen do you think we dare ask Mr Lessingham to come and dine

Please do not discourage such a delightful suggestion Lessingham
begged eagerly

I havent the least idea of doing so Helen laughed so long as I may
havesay just ten minutes to talk about Dick

It is a bargain he promised

We shall be quite alone Philippa warned him unless Henry arrives

It is the great attraction of your invitation he confessed

At eight oclock then



CHAPTER IX


Captain Griffiths to see your ladyship

Philippas fingers rested for a moment upon the keyboard of the piano
before which she was seated awaiting Lessinghams arrival Then she
glanced at the clock It was ten minutes to eight

You can show him in Mills if he wishes to see me

Captain Griffiths was ushered into the roomawkward unwieldly nervous
as usual He entered as though in a hurry and there was nothing in his
manner to denote that he had spent the last few hours making up his mind
to this visit

I must apologise for this most untimely call Lady Cranston he said
watching the closing of the door I will not take up more than five
minutes of your time

We are very pleased to see you at any time Captain Griffiths
Philippa said hospitably Do sit down please

Captain Griffiths bowed but remained standing

It is very near your dinnertime I know Lady Cranston he continued
apologetically The fact of it is however that as Commandant here
it is my duty to examine the bona fides of any strangers in the place
There is a gentleman named Lessingham staying at the hotel who I
understand gave your name as reference

Philippas eyes looked larger than ever and her face more innocent as
she gazed up at her visitor

Why of course Captain Griffiths she said Mr Lessingham was at
college with my brother and one of his best friends He has shot down
at my fathers place in Cheshire

You are speaking of your brother Major Felstead

My only brother

I am very much obliged to you Lady Cranston Captain Griffiths
declared I can see that we need not worry any more about Mr
Lessingham

Philippa laughed

It seems rather oldfashioned to think of you having to worry about
any one down here she observed It really is a very harmless
neighbourhood isnt it

There isnt much going on certainly the Commandant admitted Very
dull the place seems at times

Now be perfectly frank Philippa begged him Is there a single fact
of importance which could be learnt in this place worth communicating
to the enemy Is the danger of espionage here worth a moments
consideration

That Captain Griffiths replied in somewhat stilted fashion is not a
question which I should be prepared to answer offhand

Philippa shrugged her shoulders and appealed almost feverishly to Helen
who had just entered the room

Helen do come and listen to Captain Griffiths He is making me feel
quite creepy There are secrets about it seems and he wants to know
all about Mr Lessingham

Helen smiled with complete selfpossession

Well we can set his mind at rest about Mr Lessingham cant we she
observed as she shook hands

We can do more Philippa declared We can help him to judge for
himself We are expecting Mr Lessingham for dinner Captain Griffiths
Do stay

I couldnt think of taking you by storm like this Captain Griffiths
replied with a wistfulness which only made his voice sound hoarser and
more unpleasant It is most kind of you Lady Cranston Perhaps you
will give me another opportunity

I shant think of it Philippa insisted You must stay and dine
tonight We shall be a partie carrie for Nora goes to bed directly
after dinner I am ringing the bell to tell Mills to set an extra
place she added

Captain Griffiths abandoned himself to fate with a little shiver of
complacency He welcomed Lessingham who was presently announced with
very much less than his usual reserve and the dinner was in every way
a success Towards its close Philippa became a little thoughtful
She glanced more than once at Lessingham who was sitting by her side
almost in admiration His conversation gay at times always polished
was interlarded continually with those little social reminiscences
inevitable amongst men moving in a certain circle of English society
Apparently Richard Felstead was not the only one of his college friends
with whom he had kept in touch The last remnants of Captain Griffiths
suspicions seemed to vanish with their second glass of port although
his manner became in no way more genial

Dont you think you are almost a little too daring Philippa asked her
favoured guest as he helped her afterwards to set out a bridge table

One adapts ones methods to ones adversary he murmured with a
smile Your friend Captain Griffiths had only the very conventional
suspicions The mention of a few good English names acquaintance with
the ordinary English sports is quite sufficient with a man like that

Helen and Griffiths were talking at the other end of the room Philippa
raised her eyes to her companions

You become more of a mystery than ever she declared You are making
me even curious Tell me really why you have paid us this visit from the
clouds

She was sorry almost as soon as she had asked the question For a moment
the calm insouciance of his manner seemed to have departed His eyes
glowed

In search of new things he answered

Guns Fortifications

Neither

A spirit of mischief possessed her Lessinghams manner was baffling
and yet provocative For a moment the political possibilities of his
presence faded away from her mind She had an intense desire to break
through his reserve

Wont you tell mewhy you came

I could tell you more easily he answered in a low tone why it will
be the most miserable day of my life when I leave

She laughed at him with perfect heartiness

How delightful to be flirted with again she sighed And I thought
all German men were so heavy and paid elaborate underdone compliments
Still your secret sir please That is what I want to know

If you will have just a little patience he begged leaning so close
to her that their heads almost touched I promise that I will not leave
this place before I tell it to you

Philippas eyes for the first time dropped before his She knew
perfectly well what she ought to have done and she was singularly
indisposed to do it It was a most piquant adventure after all and
it almost helped her to forget the trouble which had been sitting so
heavily in her heart Still avoiding his eyes she called the others

We are quite ready for bridge she announced

They played four or five rubbers Lessingham was by far the most expert
player and he and Philippa in the end were the winners The two men
stood together for a moment or two at the sideboard helping themselves
to whisky and soda Griffiths had become more taciturn than ever and
even Philippa was forced to admit that the latter part of the evening
had scarcely been a success

Do you play club bridge in town Mr Lessingham Griffiths asked

Never was the calm reply

You are head and shoulders above our class down here

Very good of you to say so Lessingham replied courteously I held
good cards tonight

I wonder Griffiths went on dropping his voice a little and keeping
his eyes fixed upon his companion what the German substitute for
bridge is

I wonder Lessingham echoed

As a nation his questioner proceeded they probably dont waste as
much time on cards as we do

Lessinghams interest in the subject appeared to be nonexistent He
strolled away from the sideboard towards Philippa She for her part
was watching Captain Griffiths

So many thanks Lady Cranston Lessingham murmured for your
hospitality

And what about that secret she asked

You see there are two he answered looking down at her One I shall
most surely tell you before I leave here because it is the one secret
which no man has ever succeeded in keeping to himself As for the
other

He hesitated There was something almost like pain in his face She
broke in hastily

I did not call you away to ask about either I happened to notice
Captain Griffiths just now Do you know that he is watching you very
closely

I had an idea of it Lessingham admitted indifferently He is rather
a clumsy person is he not

You will be careful she begged earnestly Remember wont you that
Helen and I are really in a most disgraceful position if anything should
come out

Nothing shall he promised her I think you know do you not that
whatever might happen to me I should find some means to protect you

For the second time she felt a curious lack of will to fittingly reprove
his boldness She had even to struggle to keep her tone as careless as
her words

You really are a delightful person she exclaimed How long is it
since you descended from the clouds

Sometimes I think that I am there still he answered but I have
known you about seventysix hours

What precision she laughed Its a national characteristic isnt
it Captain Griffiths she continued as she observed his approach if
you really must go please take Mr Lessingham with you He is making
fun of me I dont allow even Dicks friends to do that

Lessinghams disclaimer was in quite the correct vein

You must both come again very soon their hostess concluded as she
shook hands I enjoyed our bridge immensely

The two men were already on their way to the door when a sudden idea
seemed to occur to Captain Griffiths He turned back

Bytheby Lady Cranston he asked have you heard anything from your
brother

Philippa shook her head sadly Helen who unlike her friend had not
had the advantage of a distinguished career upon the amateur dramatic
stage turned away and held a handkerchief to her eyes

Not a word was Philippas sorrowful reply

Captain Griffiths offered a clumsy expression of his sympathy

Bad luck he said Im so sorry Lady Cranston Good night once
more

This time their departure was uninterrupted Helen removed her
handkerchief from her eyes and Philippa made a little grimace at the
closed door

Do you believe Helen asked seriously that Captain Griffiths has any
suspicions

Philippa shrugged her shoulders

If he has who cares she replied a little defiantly The very idea
of a duel of wits between those two men is laughable

Perhaps so Helen agreed with a shade of doubt in her tone



CHAPTER X


Philippa and Helen started a few mornings later for one of their
customary walks The crystalline October sunshine in which every
distant tree and seaward each slowly travelling steamer seemed to
gain a new clearness of outline lay upon the deepploughed fields the
yellowing bracken and the redgold of the bending trees while the west
wind which had strewn the sea with whiteflecked waves brought down
the leaves to form a carpet for their feet and played strange music
along the woodcrested slope In the broken land through which they
made their way a land of trees and moorland with here and there a
cultivated patch the yellow gorse still glowed in unexpected corners
queer scentless flowers made splashes of colour in the hedgerows a
rabbit scurried sometimes across their path a cock pheasant after
a moments amazed stare lowered his head and rushed for unnecessary
shelter The longer they looked upwards the bluer seemed the sky The
grass beneath their feet was as green and soft as in springtime Driven
by the wind here and there a whitewinged gull sailed over their
headsa cloud of them rested upon a freshly turned little square of
ploughed land between two woods A flight of pigeons like torn leaves
tossed about by the wind circled and drifted above them Philippa
seated herself upon the trunk of a fallen tree and gazed contentedly
about her

If I had a lookingglass and a few more hairpins I should be perfectly
happy she sighed I am sure my hair must look awful

Helen glanced at it admiringly

I decline to say the correct thing she declared I will only remind
you that there will be no one here to look at it

I am not so sure Philippa replied These are the woods which the
special constables haunt by day and by night They gaze up every tree
trunk for a wireless installation and they lie behind hedges and watch
for mysterious flashes

Are you suggesting that we may meet Mr Lessingham Helen enquired
lazily I am perfectly certain that he knows nothing of the equipment
of the melodramatic spy As to Zeppelins dont you remember he told us
that he hated them and was terrified of bombs

My dear Philippa remonstrated Mr Lessingham does nothing crude

And yet Helen began

Yet I suppose the man has something at the back of his head Philippa
interrupted Sometimes I think that he has sometimes I believe that
Richard must have shown him my picture and he has come over here to see
if I am really like it

He does behave rather like that her companion admitted drily

Phillipa turned and looked at her

Helen she said severely dont be a cat

If I were to express my opinion of your behaviour Helen went on
picking up a pine cone and examining it I might astonish you

You have an evil mind Philippa yawned producing her cigarette case
What you really resent is that Mr Lessingham sometimes forgets to talk
about Dick

The poor man doesnt get much chance Helen retorted watching the
blue smoke from her cigarette and leaning back with an air of content
Whatever do you and he find to talk about Philippa

LiteratureEnglish and German Philippa murmured demurely Mr
Lessingham is remarkably well read and he knows more about our English
poets than any man I have met for years

I forgot that you enjoyed that sort of thing

Once more dont be a cat Philippa enjoined If you want me to
confess it I will own up at once You know what a simple little thing
I am I admire Mr Lessingham exceedingly and I find him a most
interesting companion

You mean her friend observed drily the Baron Maderstrom Philippa
looked around and frowned

You are most indiscreet Helen she declared I have learnt something
of the science of espionage lately and I can assure you that all spoken
or written words are dangerous There is a thoroughly British squirrel
in that tree overhead and I am sure he heard

I suppose the sunshine has got into your head Helen groaned

If you mean that I am finding it a relief to talk nonsense you are
right Philippa assented As a matter of fact I am feeling most
depressed Henry telephoned from somewhere or other before breakfast
this morning to say that he should probably be home tonight or
tomorrow They must have landed somewhere down the coast

You are a most undutiful wife Helen pronounced severely I am sure
Henry is a delightful person even if he is a little irresponsible and
it is almost pathetic to remember how much you were in love with him a
year or two ago

Some of the lightness vanished from Philippas face

That was before the war she sighed

I still think Henry is a dear though I dont altogether understand
him Helen said thoughtfully

No doubt Philippa assented but youd find the not understanding him
a little more galling if you were his wife You see I didnt know that
I was marrying a sort of sporting Mr Skimpole

I wonder Helen reflected how Henry and Mr Lessingham will get on
when they see more of one another

I really dont care Philippa observed indifferently

I used to notice sometimesthat was soon after you were married
Helen continued that Henry was just a little inclined to be jealous

Philippa withdrew her eyes from the sea There was a queer little smile
upon her lips

Well if he still is she said Ill give him something to be jealous
about

Poor Mr Lessingham Helen murmured

Philippas eyebrows were raised

Poor Mr Lessingham she repeated I dont think youll find that
hell be in the least sorry for himself

He may be in earnest Helen reminded her friend You can be horribly
attractive when you like you know Philippa

Philippa smiled sweetly

It is just possible she said that I may be in earnest myself Ive
quarrelled pretty desperately with Henry you know and Im a helpless
creature without a little admiration

Helen rose suddenly to her feet Her eyes were fixed upon a figure
approaching through the wood

You really arent respectable Philippa she declared Throw away
your cigarette for heavens sake and sit up Some one is coming

Philippa only moved her head lazily The sunlight which came down in
a thousand little zigzags through the windtossed trees fell straight
upon her rather pale defiant little face with its unexpressed evasive
charm and seemed to find a new depth of colour in the redgold of her
disordered hair Her slim perfect body was stretched almost at full
length one leg drawn a little up her hands carelessly drooping towards
the grass The cigarette was still burning in the corner of her lips

I decline she said to throw away my cigarette for any one

Least of all I trust a familiar voice interposed for me

Philippa sat upright at once smoothed her hair and looked a little
resentfully at Lessingham He was wearing a brown tweed knickerbocker
suit and he carried a gun under his arm

Whatever are you doing up here she demanded and do you know
anything about our game laws You cant come out into the woods here and
shoot things just because you feel like it

He disposed of his gun and seated himself between them

That is quite all right he assured her Your neighbour Mr
Windover to whom these woods apparently belong asked me to bring my
gun out this morning and try and get a woodcock

Gracious You dont mean that Mr Windover is here too Philippa
demanded looking around Lessingham shook his head

His car came for him at the other side of the wood he explained He
was wanted to go on the Bench I elected to walk home

And the woodcock she asked I adore woodcock

He produced one from his pocket took up her felt hat which was lying
amongst the bracken and busied himself insinuating the pin feathers
under the silk band

There he said handing it to her the first woodcock of the season
We got four and I really only accepted one in the hope that you would
like it I shall leave it with the estimable Mills on my return

You must come and share it Philippa insisted Those boys of Noras
are coming in to dinner Your gift shall be the piece de resistance

Then may I dine another night he begged This place encourages in me
the grossest of appetites

Have no fear she replied You will never see that woodcock again I
shall have it for my luncheon tomorrow I ordered dinner before I came
out and though it may be a simple feast I promise that you shall not
go away hungry

Will you promise that you will never send me away hungry he asked
dropping his voice for a moment

She turned and studied him Helen who had strolled a few yards away
was kneedeep in the golden brown bracken picking some gorgeously
coloured leaves from a solitary bramble bush Lessingham had thrown his
cap onto the ground and his windtossed hair and the unusual colour in
his cheeks were both in their way becoming His loose but wellfitting
country clothes his tie and soft collar were all wellchosen and
suitable She admired his high forehead and his firm rather proud
mouth His eyes as well as his tone were full of seriousness

You know that you ought to be saying that to some Gretchen away across
that terrible North Sea she laughed

There is no Gretchen who has ever made my heart shake as you do he
whispered

She picked up her hat and sighed

Really she said I think things are quite complicated enough as they
are I am in a flutter all day long as it is about your mission here
and your real identity I simply could not include a flirtation amongst
my excitements

I have never flirted he assured her gravely

Wise man she pronounced rising to her feet Come let us go and
help Helen pick leaves She is scratching her fingers terribly and Im
sure you have a knife A dear economical creature Helen she added
as they strolled along I am perfectly certain that those are destined
to adorn my diningtable and with chrysanthemums at sixpence each
you cant imagine how welcome they are Come produce the knife Mr
Lessingham

The knife was forthcoming and presently they all turned their faces
homeward Philippa arrested both her companions on the outskirts of
the wood and pointed to the redtiled little town to the sombre
stormbeaten grey church on the edge of the cliff to the peaceful
fields the stretch of gorsesprinkled common and the rolling stretch
of green turf on the crown of the cliffs Beyond was the foamflecked
blue sea dotted all over with cargo steamers

Would one believe she asked satirically that there should be scope
here in this forgotten little spot for the brains of aMr Lessingham

Remember that I was sent he protested The error if error there be
is not mine

And after all Helen reminded them both think how easily one may be
misled by appearances You couldnt imagine anything more honest than
the faces of the villagers and the fishermen one sees about yet do you
know Mr Lessingham that we were visited by burglars last night

Seriously he asked

Without a doubt Of course Mainsail Haul is an invitation to thieves
They could get in anywhere Last night they chose the French windows and
seem to have made themselves at home in the library

I trust Lessingham said that they did not take anything of value

They took nothing at all Philippa sighed That is the humiliating
part of it They evidently didnt like our things

How do you know that you had burglars if they took nothing away
Lessingham enquired

So practical Philippa murmured As a matter of fact I heard some
one moving about and I rang the alarm bell Mills was downstairs
almost directly and we heard some one running down the drive The French
windows were open a chair was overturned in the library and a drawer
in my husbands desk was wide open

The proof Lessingham admitted is overwhelming You were visited by
a burglar Does your husband keep anything of value in his desk

Henry hasnt anything of value in the world Philippa replied drily
except his securities and they are at the bank

Without going so far as to contradict you Lessingham observed with a
smile I still venture to disagree



CHAPTER XI


Sir Henry stepped back from the scales and eyed the fish which they had
been weighing admiringly

You see that Mills You see that Jimmy he pointed out Six and
threequarter pounds I was right almost to an ounce Hes a fine
fellow

A very extraordinary fish sir the butler observed Will you allow
me to take your oilskins Dinner was served nearly an hour ago

Sir Henry slipped off his dripping overalls and handed them over

Thats all right he replied Listen Dont say a word about my
arrival to your mistress at present I have some writing to do Bring
me a glass of sherry at once or mix a cocktail if you can do so without
being missed and take Jimmy away and give him some whisky and soda

But what about your own dinner sir

Ill have a tray in the gun room his master decided say in twenty
minutes time And Mills who did you say were dining

Two of the young officers from the Depot sirMr Harrison and Mr
Sinclairand Mr Hamar Lessingham

Lessingham eh Sir Henry repeated as he seated himself before his
writingtable Mills he added in a confidential whisper what port
did you serve

The butlers expression was one of conscious rectitude

Not the vintage sir he announced with emphasis Some very excellent
wood port which we procured for shooting luncheons The young gentlemen
like it

Youre a jewel Mills his master declared Now you understandan
aperitif for me now some whisky for Jimmy in your room and not a word
about my being here Good night Jimmy Sorry we were too late for the
mackerel but we had some grand sport all the same Youll have a day
or twos rest ashore now

Aye aye sir Dumble replied We got in just in time Theres
something more than a squall coming up norards

Sir Henry listened for a moment The French windows shook the rain beat
against the panes and a dull booming of wind was clearly audible from
outside

We timed that excellently he agreed Come up and have a chat
tomorrow Jimmy if your wife will spare you

Ill be round before eleven sir the fisherman promised with a grin

Sir Henry waited for the closing of the door Then he leaned forward for
several moments He had scarcely the appearance of a man returned from a
week or two of openair life and indulgence in the sport he loved best
The healthy tan of his complexion was lessened rather than increased
There were black lines under his eyes which seemed to speak of sleepless
nights and a beard of several days growth was upon his chin He drank
the cocktail which Mills presently brought him at a gulp and watched
with satisfaction while the mixer was vigorously shaken and a second one
poured out

Weve had a rough time Mills he observed as he set down the glass
Until this morning it scarcely left off blowing

Im sorry to hear it sir was the respectful reply If I may be
allowed to say so sir youre looking tired

I am tired Sir Henry admitted I think if I tried I could go to
sleep now for twentyfour hours

You will pardon my reminding you so far as regards your letters that
there is no post out tonight sir Mills proceeded I have prepared a
warm bath and laid out your clothes for a change

Capital Sir Henry exclaimed It isnt a letter thats bothering me
though Mills There are just a few geographical notes I want to make
You know Im trying to improve the fishermens chart of the coast round
here That fellow GroocockJimmy Dumbles unclevery nearly lost his
motor boat last week through trusting to the old one

Just so sir Mills replied deferentially placing the empty glass
upon his tray If youll excuse me sir I must get back to the dining
room

Quite right his master assented They wont be out just yet will
they

Her ladyship will probably be rising in about ten minutes sirnot
before that

Sir Henry nodded a little impatiently Directly the door was closed
he rose to his feet stood for a moment listening by the side of his
fishing cabinet then opened the glass front and touched the spring
With the aid of a little electric torch which he took from his pocket
he studied particularly a certain portion of the giant chart made some
measurements with a pencil some notes in the margin and closed it
up again with an air of satisfaction Then he resumed his seat drew
a folded slip of paper from his breast pocket a chart from another
turned up the lamp and began to write His face as he stooped low
escaped the soft shade and was for a moment almost ghastly Every now
and then he turned and made some calculations on the blottingpaper by
his side At last he leaned back with a little sigh of relief He had
barely done so before the door behind him was opened

Are we going to stay in here Mummy or are we going into the
drawingroom Nora asked

In here I think he heard Philippa reply

Then they both came in followed by Helen Nora was the first to see him
and rushed forward with a little cry of surprise

Why heres Dad she exclaimed flinging her arms around his neck
Daddy how dare you be sitting here all by yourself whilst we are
having dinner When did you get back What a fish

Sir Henry closed down his desk embraced his daughter and came forward
to meet his wife

Fine fellow isnt he Nora he agreed Well Philippa how are you
Pleased to see me I hope Another new frock I believe and in war
time

Fancy your remembering that it was war time she answered standing
very still while he leaned over and kissed her

Nasty one for me Sir Henry observed goodhumouredly How well youre
looking Helen Any news of Dick yet

Helen attempted an expression of extreme gravity with more or less
success

Nothing fresh she answered

Well well no news may be good news Sir Henry remarked consolingly
Jove its good to feel a roof over ones head again This morning has
been the only patch of decent weather weve had

This morning was lovely Helen assented Philippa and I went and sat
up in the woods

Philippa who was standing by the fire turned and looked at her husband
critically

We have some men dining she said They will be out in a few minutes
Dont you think you had better go and make yourself presentable You
smell of fish and you look as though you hadnt shaved for a week

Guilty my dear Sir Henry admitted Mills is just getting me
something to eat in the gun room and then I am going to have a bath and
change my clothes

And shave Dad Nora reminded him

And shave you young pest her father agreed patting her on the
shoulder Run away and play billiards with Helen I want to talk to
your mother until my dinners ready

Nora acquiesced promptly

Come along Helen Ill give you twentyfive up Or perhaps youd like
to play shell out she proposed Arthur Sinclair says I have improved
in my potting more than any one he ever knew

Sir Henry opened the door and closed it after them Then he returned and
seated himself on the lounge by Philippas side She glanced up at
him as though in surprise and stretching out her hand towards her
workbasket took up some knitting

I really think I should change at once if I were you she suggested

Presently I had a sort of foolish idea that Id like to have a word or
two with you first Ive been away for nearly a fortnight havent I

You have Philippa assented Perhaps that is the reason why I feel
that I havent very much to say to you

That sounds just a trifle hard he said slowly

I am hard sometimes Philippa confessed You know that quite well
There are times when I just feel as though I had no heart at all nor
any sympathy when every sensation I might have had seems shrivelled up
inside me

Is that how you are feeling at the present time towards me Philippa
he asked

Her needles flashed through the wool for a moment in silence

You had every warning she told him I tried to make you understand
exactly how your behaviour disgusted me before you went away

Yes I remember he admitted Im afraid dear you think I am a
worthless sort of a fellow

Philippa had apparently dropped a stitch She bent lower still over her
knitting There was a distinct frown upon her forehead her mouth was
unrecognisable

Your friend Lessingham is here still I understand her husband
remarked presently

Yes Philippa assented he is dining tonight You will probably see
him in a few minutes

Sir Henry looked thoughtful and studied for a moment the toe of a
remarkably unprepossessing looking shoe

Youre so keen about that sort of thing he said what about
Lessingham He is not soldiering or anything is he

I have no idea Philippa replied He walks with a slight limp and
admits that he is here as a convalescent but he hasnt told us very
much about himself

I wonder you havent tackled him Sir Henry continued Youre such
an ardent recruiter you ought to make sure that he is doing his bit of
butchery

Philippa looked up at her husband for a moment and back at her work

Mr Lessingham she said is a very delightful friend whose stay
here every one is enjoying very much but he is a comparative stranger
I feel no responsibility as to his actions

And you do as to mine

Naturally

Sir Henrys head was resting on his hand his elbow on the back of
the lounge He seemed to be listening to the voices in the dining room
beyond

Hm he observed Has he been here often while Ive been away

As often as he chose Philippa replied He has become very popular in
the neighbourhood already and he is an exceedingly welcome guest here
at any time

Takes advantage of your hospitality pretty often doesnt he

He is here most days We are always rather disappointed when he doesnt
come

Sir Henrys frown grew a little deeper

Whats the attraction he demanded

Philippa smiled It was the smile which those who knew her best feared

Well she confided I used to imagine that it was Helen but I think
that he has become a little bored talking about nothing but Dick and
their college days I am rather inclined to fancy that it must be me

You indeed he grunted Are you aware that you are a married woman

Philippa glanced up from her work Her eyebrows were raised and her
expression was one of mild surprise

How queer that you should remind me of it she murmured I am afraid
that the sea air disturbs your memory

Sir Henry rose abruptly to his feet

Oh damn he exclaimed

He walked to the door His guests were still lingering over their wine
He could hear their voices more distinctly than ever Then he came back
to the sofa and stood by Philippas side

Philippa old girl he pleaded dont let us quarrel I have had such
a hard fortnight a noreaster blowing all the time and the dirtiest
seas Ive ever known at this time of the year For five days I hadnt a
dry stitch on me and it was touch and go more than once We were all in
the water together and there was a nasty green wave that looked like
a mountain overhead and the side of our own boat bending over us
as though it meant to squeeze our ribs in It looked like ten to one
against us Phil and I got a worse chill than the sea ever gave me when
I thought that I shouldnt see you again

Philippa laid down her knitting She looked searchingly into her
husbands face She was very far from indifferent to his altered tone

Henry she said that sounds very terrible but why do you run such
risksunworthily Do you think that I couldnt give you all that you
want all that I have to give if you came home to me with a story
like this and I knew that you had been facing death righteously and
honourably for your countrys sake Why Henry there isnt a man in the
world could have such a welcome as I could give you Do you think I am
cold Of course you dont Do you think I want to feel as I have done
this last fortnight towards you Why its misery It makes me feel
inclined to commit any folly any madness to get rid of it all

Her husband hesitated A frown had darkened his face He had the air of
one who is on the eve of a confession

Philippa he began you know that when I go out on these fishing
expeditions I also put in some work at the new chart which I am so
anxious to prepare for the fishermen

Philippa shook her head impatiently

Dont talk to me about your fishermen Henry Im as sick with them
as I am with you You can see twenty or thirty of them any morning
lounging about the quay strapping young fellows who shelter themselves
behind the plea of privileged employment We are notorious down here
for our skulkers and youyou who should be the one man to set them an
example are as bad as they are You deliberately encourage them

Sir Henry abandoned his position by his wifes side His face darkened
and his eyes flashed

Skulkers he repeated furiously

Philippa looked at him without flinching

Yes Dont you like the word

The angry flush faded from his cheeks as quickly as it had come He
laughed a little unnaturally took up a cigarette from an open box and
lit it

It isnt a pleasant one is it Philippa he observed thrusting his
hands into his jacket pockets strolling away If one doesnt feel the
callwell there you are you see Jove thats a fine fish

He stood admiring the codling upon the scales Philippa continued her
work

If you intend to spend the rest of the evening with us she told him
calmly please let me remind you again that we have guests for dinner
Your present attire may be comfortable but it is scarcely becoming

He turned away and came back towards her As he passed the lamp she
started

Why youre wet she exclaimed wet through

Of course I am he admitted feeling his sleeve but to tell you the
truth in the interest of our conversation I had quite forgotten it
Here come our guests before I have had time to escape I can hear your
friend Lessinghams voice



CHAPTER XII


The three dinner guests entered together Lessingham in the middle Sir
Henrys presence was obviously a surprise to all of them

No idea that you were back sir Harrison observed shaking hands

Sir Henry greeted them all goodhumouredly I turned up about three
quarters of an hour ago he explained just too late to join you at
dinner

Bad luck sir Sinclair remarked I hope that you had good sport

Not so bad Sir Henry admitted We had to go far enough for it
though What do you think of that for an October codling

They all approached the scales and admired the fish Sir Henry stood
with his hands in his pockets listening to their comments

You are enjoying your stay here I hope Mr Lessingham he enquired

One could scarcely fail to enjoy even the briefest holiday in so
delightfully hospitable a place was the somewhat measured reply

Youre by way of being a fisherman yourself I hear Sir Henry
continued

In a very small way Lessingham acknowledged I have been out once or
twice

With Ben Oates eh

I believe that was the mans name

Philippa glanced up from her work with a little exclamation of surprise

I had no idea of that Mr Lessingham Whatever made you choose Ben
Oates He is a most disgraceful person

It was entirely by accident Lessingham explained I met him on the
front It happened to be a fine morning and he was rather pressing in
his invitation

Im afraid he didnt show you much sport Sir Henry observed From
what Jimmy Dumbles brother told him he seems to have taken you in
entirely the wrong direction and on the wrong tide

We had a small catch Lessingham replied I really went more for the
sail than the sport so I was not disappointed

The coast itself Sir Henry remarked is rather an interesting one

I should imagine so Lessingham assented Mr Ben Oates indeed
told me some wonderful stories about it He spoke of broad channels down
which a dreadnought could approach within a hundred yards of the land

He is quite right too his host agreed

Theres a lot of deep water about here The whole of the coast is very
curious in that way What thewhat the dickens is this

Sir Henry who had been strolling about the room picked up a Homburg
hat from the far side of a table of curios Philippa glanced up at his
exclamation

Thats Noras trophy she explained I told her to take it up to her
own room but shes always wanting to show it to her friends

Noras trophy Sir Henry repeated Why its nothing but an ordinary
mans hat

Nevertheless its a very travelled one sir Harrison pointed out
Miss Nora picked it up on Dutchmans Common the morning after the
observation car was found there

Sir Henry held out the hat

But Nora doesnt seriously suppose that the Germans come over in this
sort of headgear does she he demanded

If youll just look inside the lining sir Sinclair suggested

Sir Henry turned it up and whistled softly By Jove its a German hat
all right he exclaimed Doesnt look a bad shape either

He tried it on There was a little peal of laughter from the men
Philippa had ceased her knitting and was watching from the couch Sir
Henry looked at himself in the lookingglass

Well thats funny he observed I shouldnt have thought it would
have been so much too small for me Here just try how youd look in it
Mr Lessingham he added handing it across to him

Lessingham accepted the situation quite coolly and placed the hat
carefully on his head

It doesnt feel particularly comfortable he remarked

That may be Sir Henry suggested because you have it on wrong side
foremost If youd just turn it round I believe you would find it a
very good fit

Lessingham at once obeyed Sir Henry regarded him with admiration

Excellent he exclaimed Look at that Philippa Might have been made
for him eh

Lessingham looked at himself in the glass and removed the hat from his
head with some casual observation He was entirely at his ease His
host turned towards the door which Mills was holding open

Captain Griffiths sir the latter announced

Sir Henry greeted his visitor briefly

How are you Griffiths he said Glad to see you Excuse my costume
but I am just back from a fishing expedition We are all admiring Mr
Lessingham in his magic hat

Captain Griffiths shook hands with Philippa nodded to the others and
turned towards Lessingham

Put it on again theres a good fellow Lessingham Sir Henry begged
You see we have found a modern version of Cinderellas slipper The
hat which fell from the Zeppelin on to Dutchmans Common fits our friend
like a glove I never thought the Germans made such good hats did you
Griffiths

I always thought they imported their felt hats Captain Griffiths
acknowledged Is that really the one with the German name inside which
Miss Nora brought home

This is the genuine article Lessingham assented taking it from
his head and passing it on to the newcomer Notwithstanding the name
inside I should still believe that it was an English hat It feels too
comfortable for anything else

The Commandant took the hat to a lamp and examined it carefully He drew
out the lining and looked all the way round Suddenly he gave vent to a
little exclamation

Here are the owners initials he declared rather faint but still
distinguishableB M Hm Theres no doubt about its being a German
hat

B M Sir Henry muttered looking over his shoulder How very
interesting B M he repeated turning to Philippa who had
recommenced her knitting Is it my fancy or is there something a
little familiar about that

I am sure that I have no idea Philippa replied It conveys nothing
to me

There was a brief but apparently pointless silence Philippas needles
flashed through her wool with easy regularity Lessingham appeared to be
sharing the mild curiosity which the others showed concerning the hat
Sir Henry was standing with knitted brows in the obvious attitude of a
man seeking to remember something

B M he murmured softly to himself There was some one Ive known
or heard of in EnglandWhats that Mills

Your dinner is served sir Mills who had made a silent entrance
announced

Sir Henry apparently thought no more of the hat or its possible owner
He threw it upon a neighbouring table and his face expressed a new
interest in life

Jove Im ravenous he confessed Youll excuse me wont you Mills
see that these gentlemen have cigars and cigarettesin the billiard
room I should think Youll find the young people there Ill come in
and have a game of pills later

The two young soldiers with Captain Griffiths followed Sir Henry at
once from the room Lessingham however lingered He stood with his
hands behind him looking at the closed door

Are you going to stay and talk nonsense with me Mr Lessingham
Philippa asked

If I may he answered without changing his position

Philippa looked at him curiously

Do you see ghosts through that door

He shook his head

Do you know he said as he seated himself by her side there are
times when I find your husband quite interesting



CHAPTER XIII


Philippa leaned back in her place

Exactly what do you mean by that Mr Lessingham she demanded

He shook himself free from a curious sense of unreality and turned
towards her

I must confess he said that sometimes your husband puzzles me

Not nearly so much as he puzzles me Philippa retorted a little
bitterly

Has he always been so desperately interested in deepsea fishing

Philippa shrugged her shoulders

More or less but never quite to this extent The thing has become an
obsession with him lately If you are really going to stay and talk with
me do you mind if we dont discuss my husband Just now the subject is
rather a painful one with me

I can quite understand that Lessingham murmured sympathetically

What do you think of Captain Griffiths she asked a little abruptly

I have thought nothing more about him Should I Is he of any real
importance

He is military commandant here

Lessingham nodded thoughtfully

I suppose that means that he is the man who ought to be on my track
he observed

I shouldnt be in the least surprised to hear that he was Philippa
said drily I have told you that he came and asked about you the other
night when he dined here He seemed perfectly satisfied then but he
is here again tonight to see Henry and he never visits anywhere in an
ordinary way

Are you uneasy about me Lessingham enquired

I am not sure she answered frankly Sometimes I am almost terrified
and would give anything to hear that you were on your way home And at
other times I realise that you are really very clever that nothing is
likely to happen to you and that the place will seem duller than ever
when you do go

That is very kind of you he said In any case I fear that my
holiday will soon be coming to an end

Your holiday she repeated Is that what you call it

It has been little else he replied indifferently There is nothing
to be learnt here of the slightest military significance

We told you that when you arrived Philippa reminded him

I was perhaps foolish not to believe you he acknowledged

So your very exciting journey through the clouds has ended in failure
after all she went on a moment or two later

Failure No I should not call it failure

You have really made some discoveries then she enquired dubiously

I have made the greatest discovery in the world

Her eyebrows were gently raised the corners of her mouth quivered her
eyes fell

Dear me In this quiet spot she sighed

Yes

Is it Helen or me

Philippa he protested

Her eyebrows were more raised than ever Her mouth had lost its alluring
curve

Really Mr Lessingham she exclaimed Have I ever given you the
right to call me by my Christian name

In my country he answered we do not wait to ask We take

Rank Prussianism she murmured I really think you had better go back
there You are adopting their methods

I may have to at any moment he admitted or to some more distant
country still I want something to take back with me

You want a keepsake of course Philippa declared looking around the
room You can have my photographthe one over there Helen will give
you one of hers too I am sure if you ask her She is just as grateful
to you about Richard as I am

But from you he said earnestly I want more than gratitude

Dear me how persistent you are Philippa murmured Are you really
determined to make love to me

Ah dont mock me he begged What I am saying to you comes from my
heart

Philippa laughed at him quietly There was just a little break in her
voice however

Dont be absurd

There is nothing absurd about it he replied with a note of sadness
in his tone I felt it from the moment we met I struggled against it
but I have felt it growing day by day I came here with my mind filled
with different purposes I had no thought of amusing myself no thought
of seeking here the happiness which up till now I seem to have missed
I came as a servant because I was sent a mechanical being You have
changed everything For you I feel what I have never felt for any woman
before I place before you my career my freedom my honour

Philippa sighed very softly

Do you mind ringing the bell she begged

The bell he repeated What for

I want Helen to hear you she confided with a wonderful little smile

Philippa dont mock me he pleaded If this is only amusement to
you tell me so and let me go away It is the first time in my life
that a woman has come between me and my work I am no longer master of
myself I am obsessed with you I want nothing else in life but your
love

There was an almost startling change in Philippas face The banter
which had served her with so much effect which she had relied upon as
her defensive weapon was suddenly useless Lessingham had created an
atmosphere around him an atmosphere of sincerity

Are you in earnest she faltered

God knows I am he insisted

Youyou care for me

So much he answered passionately that for your sake I would
sacrifice my honour my country my life

But Ive only known you for such a short time Philippa protested
and youre an enemy

I discard my birth I renounce my adopted country he declared
fiercely You have swept my life clear of every scrap of ambition and
patriotism You have filled it with one thing onlya great consuming
love

Have you forgotten my husband

Do you think that if he had been a different sort of man I should have
dared to speak Ask yourself how you can continue to live with him You
can call him which you will Both are equally disgraceful Your heart
knows the truth He is either a coward or a philanderer

Philippas cheeks were suddenly white Her eyes flashed His words had
stung her to the quick

A coward she repeated furiously You dare to call Henry that

Lessingham rose abruptly to his feet He moved restlessly about the
room His fists were clenched his tone thick with passion

I do he pronounced Philippa look at this matter without prejudice
Do you believe that there is a single man of any country of your
husbands age and rank who would be content to trawl the seas for
fish whilst his countrys blood is being drained dry Who would weigh
a codling he added pointing scornfully to the scales whilst the
funeral march of heroes is beating throughout the world The thing is
insensate impossible

Philippas head drooped Her hands were nervously intertwined

Dont she pleaded I have suffered so much

Forgive me he begged with a sudden change of voice If I am
mistaken in your husbandand there is always the chanceI am sorry
I will confess that I myself had a different opinion of him but I can
only judge from what I have seen and from that there is no one in the
world who would not agree with me that your husband is unworthy of you

Oh please stop Philippa cried Stop at once

Lessingham came back to his place by her side His voice was still
shaking but it had grown very soft

Philippa forgive me he repeated If you only knew how it hurts to
see you like this Yet I must speak There is just once in every mans
lifetime when he must tell the truth That time has come with meI love
you

So does my husband she murmured

I will only remind you then that he shows it in strange fashion
Lessingham continued He sets your wishes at defiance He who should be
an example in a small place like this is only an object of contempt in
the neighbourhood Even I who have only lived here for so short a time
have caught the burden of what people say

Philippa wiped her eyes

Please do you mind she begged not saying anything more about
Henry You are only reminding me of things which I try all the time to
forget

Believe me Lessingham answered wistfully I am only too content to
ignore him to forget that he exists to remember only that you are the
woman who has changed my life

Philippa looked at him in something like dismay rather like a child who
has started an engine which she has no idea how to stop

But you must notyou must not talk to me like this

His hand closed upon hers It lay in his grasp unyielding cold yet
passive

Why not he whispered I have the one unalterable right and I am
willing to pay the great price

Right she faltered

The right of loving youthe right of loving you better than any woman
in the world

There was a queer silence only partly due as she was instantly aware
to the emotion of the moment A door behind them had opened Philippas
quicker senses had recognised her husbands footsteps Lessingham rose
deliberately to his feet In his heart he welcomed the interruption
This might perhaps be the decisive moment Sir Henry was strolling
towards them His manner and his tone however were alike goodnatured

I was to order you into the billiard room Mr Lessingham he
announced Sinclair has been sent fora night route march or some
such horrorand they want you to make a four

Lessingham hesitated He had a passionate inclination to face
the situation to tell this man the truth Sir Henrys courteous
indifference however was like a harrier He recognised the inevitable

I am afraid I am rather out of practice he said but I shall be
delighted to do my best



CHAPTER XIV


Sir Henry was obviously not in the best of tempers For a mildmannered
and easygoing man his expression was scarcely normal

That fellow was making love to you he said bluntly as soon as the
door was closed behind Lessingham

Philippa looked up at her husband with an air of pleasant candour

He was doing it very nicely too she admitted

You mean to say that you let him

I listened to what he had to say she confessed It didnt occur to
you I suppose her husband remarked with somewhat strained sarcasm
that you were another mans wife

I am doing my best to forget that fact Philippa reminded him

I see And he is to help you

Possibly

Sir Henrys irritation was fast merging into anger

I shall turn the fellow out of the house he declared

Philippa shrugged her shoulders

Why dont you

He seated himself on the couch by his wifes side Look here Philippa
dont lets wrangle he begged Im afraid youll have to make up your
mind to see a good deal less of your friend Lessingham anyway

Philippas brows were knitted She was conscious of a vague uneasiness

Really And why

For one thing her husband explained because I dont intend to have
him hanging about my house during my absence

The best way to prevent that would be not to go away Philippa
suggested

Well in all probability he announced guardedly I am not going away
againat least not just yet

Philippas manner suddenly changed She laid down her work Her hand
rested lightly upon her husbands shoulder

You mean that you are going to give up those horrible fishing
excursions of yours

For the present I am he assured her

And are you going to do somethingsome work I mean she asked
breathlessly

For the immediate present I am going to stay at home and look after
you he replied

Philippas face fell Her manner became notably colder

You are very wise she declared Mr Lessingham is a most fascinating
person We are all half in love with himeven Helen

The fellow must have a way with him Sir Henry conceded grudgingly
As a rule the people here are not overkeen on strangers unless they
have immediate connections in the neighbourhood Even Griffiths who
since they made him Commandant is a man of many suspicions seems
inclined to accept him

Captain Griffiths dined here the other night Philippa remarked and
I noticed that he and Mr Lessingham seemed to get on very well

The fellows all right in his way no doubt Sir Henry began

Of course he is Philippa interrupted Helen likes him quite as much
as I do

Does he make love to Helen too Sir Henry ventured

Dont talk nonsense Philippa retorted He isnt that sort of a
man at all If he has made love to me he has done so because I have
encouraged him and if I have encouraged him it is your fault

Sir Henry with an impatient exclamation rose from his place and took a
cigarette from an open box

Quite time I stayed at home I can see All the same the fellows
rather a puzzle I cant help wondering how he succeeded in making
such an easy conquest of a lady who has scarcely been notorious for her
flirtations and a young woman who is madly in love with another man He
hasnt

Hasnt what

He hasnt Sir Henry continued blowing out the match which he
had been holding to his cigarette and throwing it away been in the
position of being able to render you or Helen any service has he

I dont understand you Philippa replied a little uneasily

Theres nothing to understand Sir Henry went on I was simply trying
to find some explanation for his veni vidi vici

I dont think you need go any further than the fact Philippa
observed that he is wellbred charming and companionable

Incidentally Sir Henry queried do you happen to have come across
any one here who ever heard of him before

I dont remember any one Philippa replied He was at college with
Richard you know

Sir Henry nodded

Of course thats a wonderful introduction to you and Helen he
admitted And bytheby that reminds me he went on I never saw
such a change in two women in my life as in you and Helen A few weeks
ago you were fretting yourselves to death about Dick Now you dont seem
to mention him you both of you look as though you hadnt a care in the
world and yet you say you havent heard from him Upon my word this is
getting to be a house of mysteries

The only mystery in it that I can see is you Henry she declared

Me he protested Im one of the simplestminded fellows alive What
is there mysterious about me

Your ignominious life was the cold reply

Jove I got it that time he groanedgot it in the neck But didnt
I tell you just now that I was turning over a new leaf

Then prove it Philippa pleaded Let me write to Rayton and beg him
to use his influence to get you something to do I am sure you would be
happier and I cant tell you what a difference it would make to me

Its that indoor work I couldnt stick old thing he confided You
know theyre saying all the time its a young mans war Theyd make me
take some ones place at home behind a desk

But even if they did she protested even if they put you in a coal
cellar wouldnt you be happier to feel that you were helping your
country Wouldnt you be glad to know that I was happier

Sir Henry made a wry face

It seems to me that your outlook is a trifle superficial dear he
grumbled Howevernow what the dickens is the matter

The door had been opened by Mills with his usual smoothness but Jimmy
Dumble out of breath and excited pushed his way into the room

Hullo What is it Jimmy his patron demanded

Beg your pardon sir was the almost incoherent reply Ive run all
the way up and theres a rare wind blowing Theres one of ourour
trawlers lying off the Point and shes sent up three green and six
yellow balls

Whiting by God Sir Henry exclaimed

Whiting Philippa repeated in agonised disgust What does this mean
Henry

It must be a shoal her husband explained It means that weve got to
get amongst them quick Is the Ida down on the beach Jimmy

She there all right sir was the somewhat doubtful reply but usll
have a rare job to get away sir That there noreaster is blowing great
guns again and its a cruel tide

Weve got to get out somehow Sir Henry declared Mills my oilskins
and flask at once I shant change a thing but you might bring a
cardigan jacket and the whisky and soda

Mills withdrew a little dazed Philippa whose fingers were clenched
together found her tongue at last

Henry she exclaimed furiously

What is it my dear

Do you mean to tell me that after your promise she continued after
what you have just said you are starting out tonight for another
fishing expedition

Whiting my dear Sir Henry explained One cant possibly miss
whiting Where the devil are my keysHere they are Now then

He sat down before his desk took some papers from the top drawer
rummaged about for a moment or two in another and found what seemed
to be a couple of charts in oilskin cases All the time the wind was
shaking the windows and a storm of rain was beating against the panes

Help yourself to whisky and soda Jimmy Sir Henry invited as he
buttoned up his coat Youll need it all presently

I thank you kindly sir Jimmy replied I am thinking that well both
need a drink before were through this night

He helped himself to a whisky and soda on the generous principle of
half and half Philippa who was watching her husbands preparations
indignantly once more found words

Henry you are incorrigible she exclaimed Listen to me if you
please I insist upon it

Sir Henry turned a little impatiently towards her Philippa I really
cant stop now he protested But you must You shall she cried
You shall hear this much from me at any rate before you go What I
said the other day I repeat a thousandfold now

Sir Henry glanced at Dumble and motioned his head towards the door The
fisherman made an awkward exit

A thousandfold Philippa repeated passionately You hear Henry I do
not consider myself any more your wife If I am here when you return it
will be simply because I find it convenient Your conduct is disgraceful
and unmanly

My dear girl he remonstrated I may be back in twentyfourpossibly
twelve hours

It is a matter of indifference to me when you return was the curt
reply I have finished

The door was thrown open

Your oilskins sir and flask Mills announced hurrying in a little
breathless Youll forgive my mentioning it sir but it scarcely seems
a fit night to leave home

Got to be done this once Mills his master replied struggling into
his coat

The young people from the billiard room suddenly streamed in Nora who
was still carrying her cue gazed at her father in amazement

Why wheres Dad going she cried

It appears Philippa explained sarcastically that a shoal of whiting
has arrived

Very uncertain fish whiting Sir Henry observed here today and
gone tomorrow

You wont find it too easy getting off tonight sir Harrison
remarked doubtfully

Jimmy will see to that was the confident reply I expect we shall be
amongst them at daybreak Goodby everybody Goodby Philippa

His eyes sought his wifes in vain She had turned towards Lessingham

You are not hurrying off are you Mr Lessingham she asked I want
you to show me that new Patience

I shall be delighted

Sir Henry turned slowly away For a moment his face darkened as his eyes
met Lessinghams He seemed about to speak but changed his mind

Well goodby every one he called out I shall be back before
midnight if we dont get out

And if you do Nora cried

If we do Heaven help the whiting



CHAPTER XV


Of course were behaving shockingly all three of us Philippa
declared as she sipped her champagne and leaned back in her seat

You mean by coming to a place like this Lessingham queried looking
around the crowded restaurant We are not in that case the only
sinners

I didnt mean the mere fact of being here Philippa explained but
being here with you

I forgot he said gloomily that I was such a black sheep

Dont be silly she admonished Youre nothing of the sort But of
course we are skating on rather thin ice If I had Henry to consider
in any way if he had any sort of a career perhaps I should be more
careful As it is I think I feel a little reckless lately Dreymarsh
has got upon my nerves The things that I thought most of in life seem
to have crumbled away

Ought I to be sorry he asked I am not

But why are you so unsympathetic

Because I am waiting by your side to rebuild he whispered

A tall bronzed young soldier with his arm in a sling stopped before
their table and Helen after a moments protest and a glance at
Philippa moved away with him to the little space reserved for the
dancers

What a chaperon I am Philippa sighed I scarcely know anything about
the young man except his name and that he was in Dicks regiment

I did not hear it Lessingham observed but I feel deeply grateful
to him It is so seldom that I have a chance to talk to you alone like
this

It seems incredible that we have talked so long Philippa said
glancing at the watch upon her wrist I really feel now that I know all
about youyour school days your college days and your soldiering You
have been very frank havent you

I have nothing to concealfrom you he replied If there is anything
more you want to know

There is nothing she interrupted uneasily

Perhaps you are wise he reflected and yet some day you know you
will have to hear it all over and over again

I will not be made love to in a restaurant she declared firmly

You are so particular as to localities he complained You could
not see your way clear I suppose to suggest what you would consider a
suitable environment

Philippa looked at him for a moment very earnestly

Ah dont let us play at things we neither of us feel she begged
And there is some one there who wants to speak to you

Lessingham looked up into the face of the man who had paused before
their table as one might look into the face of unexpected death He
remained perfectly still but the slight colour seemed slowly to
be drawn from his cheeks Yet the newcomer himself seemed in no way
terrifying He was tall and largely built cleanshaven and with
the humourous mouth of an Irishman or an American Neither was there
anything threatening in his speech

Glad to run up against you Lessingham he said holding out his hand
Gay crowd here tonight isnt it

Very Lessingham answered speaking very much like a man in a dream
Lady Cranston will you permit me to introduce my friendMr Hayter

Philippa was immediately gracious and a few moments passed in trivial
conversation Then Mr Hayter prepared to depart

I must be joining my friends he observed Look in and see me
sometime LessinghamNumber 72 Milan Court You know what a nightbird
I am Perhaps you will call and have a final drink with me when you have
finished here

I shall be very glad Lessingham promised

Mr Hayter passed on a man apparently of many acquaintances to judge
by his interrupted progress Lady Cranston looked at her companion She
was puzzled

Is that a recent acquaintance she asked as he addressed you by the
name of Lessingham

Yes was the quiet reply

You dont wish to talk about him

No

Helen and her partner returned a few moments later and the little
party presently broke up Lessingham drove the two women to their hotel
in Dover Street

Weve had a most delightful evening Philippa assured him as they
said good night You are coming round to see us in the morning arent
you

If I may Lessingham assented

Helen found her way into Philippas room later on that night She had
nerved herself for a very thankless task

May I sit down for a few moments she asked a little nervously Your
fire is so much better than mine

Philippa glanced at her friend through the lookingglass before which
she was brushing her hair and made a little grimace She felt a
forewarning of what was coming

Of course dear she replied Have you enjoyed your evening

Very much in a way was the somewhat hesitating reply Of course
nothing really counts until Dick comes back but it is nice to talk with
some one who knows him

Agreeable conversation Philippa remarked didactically is one of the
greatest pleasures in life

You find Mr Lessingham very interesting dont you Helen asked

Philippa finished arranging her hair to her satisfaction and drew up an
easychair opposite her visitors

So you want to talk with me about Mr Lessingham do you

I suppose you know that hes in love with you Helen began

I hope he is a little my dear was the smiling reply Im sure Ive
tried my best

Wont you talk seriously Helen pleaded

I dont altogether see the necessity Philippa protested

I do and Ill tell you why Helen answered I dont think Mr
Lessingham is at all the type of man to which you are accustomed I
think that he is in deadly earnest about you I think that he was in
deadly earnest from the first You dont really care for him do you
dear

Very much and yet not perhaps quite in the way you are thinking of
was the quiet reply

Then please send him away Helen begged

My dear how can I Philippa objected He has done us an immense
service and he cant disobey his orders

You dont want him to go away then

Philippa was silent for several moments No she admitted I dont
think that I do

You dont care for Henry any more

Just as much as ever was the somewhat bitter reply Thats what I
resent so much I should like Henry to believe that he had killed every
spark of love in me

Helen moved across and sat on the arm of her friends chair She felt
that she was going to be very daring

Have you any idea at the back of your mind dear she asked of making
use of Mr Lessingham to punish Henry

Philippa moved a little uneasily

How hatefully downright you are she murmured I dont know

Because Helen continued if you have any such idea in your mind I
think it is most unfair to Mr Lessingham You know perfectly well that
anything else between you and him would be impossible

And why

Dont be ridiculous Helen exclaimed vigorously Mr Lessingham may
have all the most delightful qualities in the world but he has attached
himself to a country which no English man or woman will be able to
think of without shuddering for many years to come You cant dream
of cutting yourself adrift from your friends and your home and your
country Its too unnatural Im not even arguing with you Philippa
You couldnt do it Im wholly concerned with Mr Lessingham I cannot
forget what we owe him I think it would be hatefully cruel of you to
spoil his life

Philippas flashes of seriousness were only momentary She made a little
grimace She was once more her natural irresponsible self

You underrate my charm Helen she declared I really believe that I
could make his life instead of spoiling it

And you would pay the price

Philippa slim and elflike in the firelight rose from her chair There
was a momentary cruelty in her face

I sometimes think she said calmly that I would pay any price in the
world to make Henry understand how I feel There now run along dear
Youre full of good intentions and dont think it horrid of me but
nothing that you could say would make any difference

You wouldnt do anything rash Helen pleaded

Well if I run away with Mr Lessingham I certainly cant promise that
Ill send cards out first Whatever I do impulse will probably decide

Impulse

Why not I trust mine Cant you Philippa added with a little shrug
of the shoulders

Sometimes Helen sighed they are such wild horses you know They
lead one to such terrible places

And sometimes Philippa replied they find their way into the heaven
where our soberer thoughts could never take us Good night dear



CHAPTER XVI


Mr William Hayter in the solitude of his chambers at the Milan Court
was a very altered personage He extended no welcoming salutation to his
midnight visitor but simply motioned him to a chair

Well he began is your task finished that you are in London

My task Lessingham replied might just as well never have been
entered upon The man you sent me to watch is nothing but an ordinary
sportloving Englishman

Really You have lived as his neighbour for nearly a month and that is
your impression of him

It is Lessingham assented He has been away seafishing half the
time but I have searched his house thoroughly

Searched his papers eh

Every one I could find and hated the job There are a good many charts
of the coast but they are all for the use of the fishermen

Wonderful Hayter scoffed My young friend you may yet find
distinction in some other walk of life Our secret service I fancy
will very soon be able to dispense with your energies

And I with your secret service Lessingham agreed heartily I dare
say there may be some branches of it in which existence is tolerable
That however does not apply to the task upon which I have been
engaged

You have been completely duped Hayter told him calmly and the
information you have sent us is valueless Sir Henry Cranston instead
of being the type of man whom you have described is one of the greatest
experts upon coast defense and minelaying in the English Admiralty

Lessingham laughed shortly

That he declared is perfectly absurd

It is Hayter repeated with emphasis the precise truth Sir Henry
Crantons fishing excursions are myths He is simply transferred from
his fishing boat on to one of a little fleet of socalled mine sweepers
from which he conducts his operations Nearly every one of the most
important towns on the east coast are protected by minefields of his
design

Lessingham was dumbfounded His companions manner was singularly
convincing

But how could Sir Henry or any one else keep this a secret he
protested Even his wife is scarcely on speaking terms with him because
she believes him to be an idler and the whole neighbourhood gossips
over his slackness

The whole neighbourhood is easily fooled Hayter retorted There are
one or two who know however

There are one or two Lessingham observed grimly who are beginning
to suspect me

That is a pity Hayter admitted because it will be necessary for you
to return to Dreymarsh at once

Return to Dreymarsh at once But Cranston is away There is nothing for
me to do there in his absence

He will be back on Wednesday or Thursday night was the confident
reply He will bring with him the plan of his latest defenses of a town
on the east coast which our cruiser squadron purpose to bombard We
must have that chart

Lessingham listened in mute distress

Could you possibly get me relieved he begged The fact is

We could not and we will not Hayter interrupted fiercely Unless
you wish me to denounce you at home as a renegade and a coward you will
go through with the work which has been allotted to you Your earlier
mistakes will be forgiven if that chart is in my hands by Friday

But how do you know that he will have it Lessingham protested
Supposing you are right and he is really responsible for the minefields
you speak of I should think the last thing he would do would be to
bring the chart back to Dreymarsh

As a matter of fact that is precisely what he will do Hayter assured
his listener He is bringing it back for the inspection of one of the
commissioners for the east coast defense who is to meet him at his
house And I wish to warn you too Maderstrom that you will have very
little time For some reason or other Cranston is dissatisfied with the
secrecy under which he has been compelled to work and has applied
to the Admiralty for recognition of his position Immediately this is
given I gather that his house will be inaccessible to you

Lessingham sat his arms folded his eyes fixed upon the fire His
thoughts were in a turmoil yet one thing was hatefully clear Cranston
was not the unworthy slacker he had believed him to be Philippas whole
point of view might well be changed by this discoveryespecially now
that Cranston had made up his mind to assert himself for his wifes
sake There was an icy fear in his heart

You understand Hayter persisted coldly what it is you have to do

Perfectly I shall return by the afternoon train was the despairing
reply

If you succeed Hayter continued I shall see that you get the usual
acknowledgment but I will if you wish it ask for your transfer to
another branch of the service I am not questioning your patriotism or
your honour Maderstrom but you are not the man for this work

You are right Lessingham said I am not

It is not my affair Hayter proceeded to enquire too closely into
the means used by our agents in carrying out our designs That I find
you in London in company with the wife of the man whom you are appointed
to watch may be a fact capable of the most complete and satisfactory
explanation I ask no questions I only remind you that your country
even though it be only your adopted country demands from you as from
all others in her service unswerving loyalty a loyalty uninfluenced by
the claims of personal sentiment duty or honour Have I said enough

You have said as much as it is wise for you to say Lessingham
replied his voice trembling with suppressed passion

That is all then the other concluded You know where to send
or bring the chart when you have it If you bring it yourself it
is possible that something which you may regard as a reward will be
offered to you

Lessingham rose a little wearily to his feet His farewell to Hayter was
cold and lifeless

He left the hotel and started on his homeward way struggling with a
sense of intolerable depression The streets through which he passed
were sombre and unlit

A Zeppelin warning a few hours before had driven the people to their
homes There was not a chink of light to be seen anywhere An intense
and gloomy stillness seemed to brood over the deserted thoroughfares
Nightbirds on their way home flitted by like shadows Policemen lurked
in the shadows of the houses The few vehicles left crawled about with
insufficient lights Even the warning horns of the taxicab men sounded
furtive and repressed Lessingham as he marched stolidly along felt
curiously in sympathy with his environment Hayters news brought him
face to face with that inner problem which had so suddenly become the
dominant factor in his life For the first time he knew what love was
He felt the wonder of it the farreaching possibilities the strange
idealism called so unexpectedly into being He recognized the vagaries
of Philippas disposition and yet during the last few days he had
convinced himself that she was beginning to care Her strained relations
with her husband had been without a doubt her first incentive towards
the acceptance of his proffered devotion Now he told himself with eager
hopefulness that some portion of it however minute must be for his own
sake The relations between husband and wife he reminded himself must
at any rate have been strained during the last few months or Cranston
would never have been able to keep his secret In his gloomy passage
through this land of ill omens however he shivered a little as he
thought of the other possibilitytortured himself with imagining what
might happen during her revulsion of feeling if Philippa discovered the
truth A sense of something greater than he had yet known in life seemed
to lift him into some lofty state of aloofness from which he could
look down and despise himself the poor tired plodder wearing the heavy
chains of duty There was a life so much more wonderful just the other
side of the clouds a very short distance away a life of alluring and
passionate happiness Should he ever find the courage he wondered to
escape from the treadmill and go in search of it Duty for the last two
years had taken him by the hand and led him along a pathway of shame
He had never been a hypocrite about the war He was one of those who had
acknowledged from the first that Germany had set forth with the sword
in her hand on a war of conquest His own inherited martial spirit had
vaguely approved he too in those earlier days had felt the sunlight
upon his rapier Later had come the enlightenment the turbulent waves
of doubt the nightmare of a nations awakening conscience mirrored in
his own soul It was in a depression shared perhaps in a lesser
degree by millions of those whose ranks he had joined that he felt this
passionate craving for escape into a world which took count of other
things



CHAPTER XVII


Punctually at 12 oclock the next morning Lessingham presented himself
at the hotel in Dover Street and was invited by the hall porter to take
a seat in the lounge Philippa entered a few minutes later her eyes
and cheeks brilliant with the brisk exercise she had been taking her
slim figure most becomingly arrayed in grey cloth and chinchilla

I lost Helen in Harrods she announced but I know shes lunching
with friends so it really doesnt matter Youll have to take care of
me Mr Lessingham until the train goes if you will

For even longer than that if you will he murmured

She laughed More pretty speeches I dont think Im equal to them
before luncheon

This time I am literal he explained I am coming back to Dreymarsh
myself

He felt his heart beat quicker a sudden joy possessed him Philippas
expression was obviously one of satisfaction

Im so glad she assured him Do you know I was thinking only as I
came back in the taxicab how I should miss you

She was standing with her foot upon the broad fender and her first
little impulse of pleasure seemed to pass as she looked into the fire
She turned towards him gravely

After all do you think you are wise she asked Of course I dont
think that any one at Dreymarsh has the least suspicion but you know
Captain Griffiths did ask questions andwell youre safely away now
You have been so wonderful about Dick so wonderful altogether she
went on that I couldnt bear it if trouble were to come

He smiled at her

I think I know what is at the back of your mind he said You think
that I am coming back entirely on your account As it happens this is
not so

She looked at him with wideopen eyes

Surely she exclaimed you have satisfied yourself that there is no
field for your ingenuity in Dreymarsh

I thought that I had he admitted It seems that I am wrong I have
had orders to return

Orders to return she repeated From whom

He shook his head

Of course I ought not to have asked that she proceeded hastily
but it does seem odd to realise that you can receive instructions and
messages from Germany here in London

Very much the same sort of thing goes on in Germany he reminded her

So they say she admitted but one doesnt come into contact with it
So you are really coming back to Dreymarsh

With you if I may

Naturally she agreed

He glanced at the clock We might almost be starting for lunch he
suggested

She nodded As soon as Ive told Grover about the luggage

She was absent only a few moments and then as it was a dry sunny
morning they walked down St James Street and along Pall Mall to the
Carlton Philippa met several acquaintances but Lessingham walked with
his head erect looking neither to the right nor to the left

Arent you sometimes afraid of being recognised she asked him There
must be a great many men about of your time at Magdalen for instance

Nine years makes a lot of difference he reminded her and besides I
have a theory that it is only when the eyes meet that recognition really
takes place So long as I do not look into any ones face I feel quite
safe

You are sure that you would not like to go to a smaller place than the
Carlton

It makes no difference he assured her My credentials have been
wonderfully established for me

Im so glad she confessed I know its most unfashionable but I do
like these big places If ever I had my way I should like to live
in London and have a cottage in the country instead of living in the
country and being just an hotel dweller in London

I wonder if New York would not do he ventured

I expect I should like New York she murmured

I think he said in fact I am almost sure that when I leave here I
shall go to the United States

She looked at him and turned suddenly away They arrived just then at
their destination and the moment passed Lessingham left his companion
in the lounge while he went back into the restaurant to secure his
table and order lunch When he came back he found Philippa sitting very
upright and with a significant glitter in her eyes

Look over there she whispered by the palm

He followed the direction which she indicated A man was standing
against one of the pillars talking to a tall dark woman obviously a
foreigner wrapped in wonderful furs There was something familiar about
his figure and the slight droop of his head

Why its Sir Henry Lessingham exclaimed as the man turned around

My husband Philippa faltered

Sir Henry if indeed it were he seemed afflicted with a sudden
shortsightedness He met the incredulous gaze both of Lessingham and his
wife without recognition or any sign of flinching At that distance it
was impossible to see the tightening of his lips and the steely flash in
his blue eyes

The whiting seem to have brought him a long way Philippa said with
an unnatural little laugh

Shall I go and speak to him Lessingham asked

For heavens sake no she insisted Dont leave me I wouldnt have
him come near me for anything in the world It is only a few weeks ago
that I begged him to come to London with me and he said that he hated
the place You dont knowthe woman

Lessingham shook his head

She looks like a foreigner was all he could say

Take me in to lunch at once Philippa begged rising abruptly to her
feet This is really the last straw

They passed up the stairway and within a few feet of where Sir Henry
was standing He appeared absorbed however in conversation with his
companion and did not even turn around Philippas little face
seemed to have hardened as she took her seat Only her eyes were still
unnaturally bright

I am so sorry if this has annoyed you Lessingham regretted You
would not care to go elsewhere

I Go anywhere else she exclaimed scornfully Thank you I am
perfectly satisfied here And with my companion she added with a
brilliant little smile Now tell me about New York Have you ever been
there

Twice he told her At present the dream of my life is to go there
with you

She looked at him a little wonderingly

I wonder if you really care she said Men get so much into the habit
of saying that sort of thing to women Sometimes it seems to me they
must do a great deal of mischief But youIs that really your wish

I would sacrifice everything that I have ever held dear in life he
declared with his face aglow for its realization

But you would be a deserter from your country she pointed out You
would never be able to return Your estates would be confiscated You
would be homeless

Home he said softly is where ones heart takes one Home is just
where love is

Her eyes as they met his were for a moment suspiciously soft Then
she began to talk very quickly of other things to compare notes of
countries which they had both visited even of people whom they had met
They were obliged to leave early to catch their train As they passed
down the crowded restaurant they once more found themselves within a few
feet of Sir Henry His back was turned to them and he was apparently
ignorant of their near presence The party had become a partie Carrie
another man and a still younger and more beautiful woman having joined
it

Of course Philippa said as they descended the stairs I am behaving
like an idiot I ought to go and tell Henry exactly what I think of him
or pull him away in the approved Whitechapel fashion We lose so much
dont we by stifling our instincts

For the next few minutes he replied glancing at his watch I think
we had better concentrate our attention upon catching our train

They reached Kings Cross with only a few minutes to spare Grover
however had already secured a carriage and Helen was waiting for them
ensconced in a corner She accepted the news of Lessinghams return with
resignation Philippa became thoughtful as they drew towards the close
of their journey and the slow frosty twilight began to creep down upon
the land

I suppose we dont really know what war is she observed looking
out of the window at a comfortable little village tucked away with a
background of trees and guarded by a weatherbeaten old church The
people are safe in their homes You must appreciate what that means Mr
Lessingham

Indeed I do he answered gravely I have seen the earth torn and
dismembered as though by the plough of some destroying angel A few
blackened ruins where an hour or so before a peaceful village stood
men and women running about like lunatics stricken with a mortal fear
And all the time a red glow on the horizon a bloodred glow and little
specks of grey or brown lying all over the fields even the cattle
racing round in terror And every now and then the cry of Death You are
fortunate in England

Philippa leaned forward

Do you believe that our turn will come she asked Do you believe
that the wave will break over our country

Who can tell

Ah no but answer me she begged Is it possible for you to land an
army here

I think he replied that all things are possible to the military
genius of Germany The only question is whether it is worth while
Germans are supposed to be sentimentalists you know I rather doubt it
There is nothing would set the joybells of Berlin clanging so much as
the news of a German invasion of Great Britain On the other hand
there is a great party in Germany and a very farseeing one which is
continually reminding the Government that without Great Britain as a
market Germany would never recover from the financial strain of the
war

This is all too impersonal Philippa objected Do you in your heart
believe that the time might come when in the night we should hear the
guns booming in Dreymarsh Bay and see your greyclad soldiers forming
up on the beach and scaling our cliffs

That will not be yet he pronounced It has been thought of Once it
was almost attempted Just at present no

Philippa drew a sigh of relief

Then your mission in Dreymarsh has nothing to do with an attempted
landing

Nothing he assured her I can even go a little further I can tell
you that if ever we do try to land it will be in an unsuspected place
in an unexpected fashion

Well its really very comforting to hear these things at firsthand
Philippa declared with some return to her usual manner I suppose we
are really two disgraceful women Helen and Itraitors and all the rest
of it Here we sit talking to an enemy as though he were one of our best
friends

I refuse to be called an enemy Lessingham protested There are times
when individuality is a far greater thing than nationality I am just a
human being born into the same world and warmed by the same sun as you
Nothing can alter the fact that we are fellow creatures

Dreymarsh once more Philippa announced looking out of the window
And youre a terribly plausible person Mr Lessingham Come round and
see us after dinnerif it doesnt interfere with your work

On the contrary he murmured under his breath Thank you very much



CHAPTER XVIII


Sir Henry was standing with his hands in his pockets and a very blank
expression upon his face looking out upon the Admiralty Square He was
alone in a large barely furnished apartment the walls of which were
so hung with charts that it had almost the appearance of a schoolroom
prepared for an advanced geography class The table from which he had
risen was covered with an amazing number of scientific appliances some
samples of rock and sand two microscopes and several telephones

Sir Henry having apparently exhausted the possibilities of the outlook
turned somewhat reluctantly away to find himself confronted by an
elderly gentleman of cheerful appearance who at that moment had entered
the room From the fact that he had done so without knocking it was
obvious that he was an intimate

Well my gloomy friend the newcomer demanded whats wrong with
you

Sir Henry was apparently relieved to see his visitor He pushed a chair
towards him and indicated with a gesture of invitation a box of cigars
upon his desk


Your little Laranagas he observed Try one

The visitor opened the box sniffed at its contents and helped himself

Now then get at it Henry he enjoined Ive a Board in
halfanhour and three dispatches to read before I go in Whats your
trouble

Look here Rayton was the firm reply I want to chuck this infernal
holeandcorner business I tell you Ive worked it threadbare at
Dreymarsh and its getting jolly uncomfortable

The newcomer grinned

Poor chap he observed watching his cigar smoke curl upwards Youre
in a nasty mess you know Henry Did I tell you that I had a letter
from your wife the other day asking me if I couldnt find you a job

Sir Henry waited a little grimly whilst his friend enjoyed the joke

Thats all very well he said but we are on the point of a
separation or something of the sort Ill admit it was all right at
first to run the thing on the QT but thats pretty well busted up by
now Why according to your own reports they know all about me on the
other side

Not a doubt about it the other agreed Im not sure that you havent
got a spy fellow down at Dreymarsh now

Im quite sure of it Sir Henry replied grimly The brute was
lunching with my wife at the Carlton today and as luck would have it
I was landed with that Russian Admirals wife and sisterinlaw Youre
breaking up the happy home thats what youre doing Rayton

His lordship at any rate seemed to find the process amusing He laughed
until the tears stood in his eyes

I should love to have seen Philippas face he chuckled when she
walked into the restaurant and saw you there Youre supposed to be off
on a fishing expedition arent you

I went out after whiting Sir Henry groaned and Id just promised to
chuck it for a time when I got the Admirals message

Well well see to your German spy anyway his visitor promised

Dont be an ass Sir Henry exclaimed irritably I dont want the
fellow touched at present Why hes been a sort of persona grata at my
house Hangs around there all the time when Im away

All the more reason for putting an end to his little game I should
say was the cheerful reply

And have the whole neighbourhood either laughing at my wife and Miss
Fairclough or talking scandal about them Sir Henry retorted

I forgot that his friend confessed ruminatively Hes a gentlemanly
sort of fellow from what I hear but a rotten spy What do you want
done with him

Leave him for me to deal with Sir Henry insisted I have a little
scheme on hand in which he is concerned

Rayton scratched his chin doubtfully

The fellow may not be such a fool as he seems he reminded his friend

I wont run any risks Sir Henry promised I just want him left
there thats all And look here Rayton you know what I want from you
I quite agreed to your proposals as to my anonymity at the time when I
was up in Scotland but the things a secret no longer with the people
who count Every one in Germany knows that Im a minefield specialist
so I dont see why the dickens I should pose any longer as a sort of
halfbaked idiot

Raytons eyes twinkled

You want to play the Wilson Barrett hero and make a theatrical
disclosure of your greatness he laughed Poor Philippa will fall
upon her knees You will be the hero of the village which will probably
present you with some little article of plate Youve a good time
coming Henry

Talk sense theres a good fellow the other begged You go and see
the Chief and put it to him There isnt a single reason why I shouldnt
own up now

Ill see what I can do Rayton promised but what about this fellow
Lessingham or whatever else he calls himself down there Theres a
chap named GriffithsCommandant isnt hebeen writing us about him

I wont have Lessingham touched Sir Henry insisted He cant do any
particular harm down there and there isnt a line or a drawing of mine
down at Dreymarsh which he isnt welcome to

Lord Rayton rose to his feet

Look here Henry old fellow he said I do sympathise with you up
to a certain point I tell you what Ill do I shall have to answer
Philippas letter and Ill answer it in such a way that if she is as
clever a little woman as I think she is shell get a hint Of course
he went on ruminatively it is rather a misfortune that the Princess
Ollaneff and her sister are such jolly goodlooking women Makes it look
a little fishy doesnt it What I mean to say is its a far cry
from fishing for whiting in the North Sea to lunching with a beautiful
princess at the Carltonwhen you think your wifes down in Norfolk

Sir Henry threw open the door

Look here Ive had enough of you Rayton he declared You get back
and do an hours work if you can bring your mind to it

The latter assumed a sudden dignity necessitated by the sound of voices
in the corridor and departed The door had scarcely been closed
when two younger men presented themselvesMiles Ensol Sir Henrys
secretary a typicallooking young sailor minus his left arm and a
palefaced cleanshaven man of uncertain age in civilian clothes Sir
Henry shook hands with the latter and pointed to the easychair which
his previous visitor had just vacated

Welcome back again Horridge he said cordially Miles Ill ring
when I want you

Very good sir the secretary replied Theres a fisherman from
Norfolk downstairs when youre at liberty

Sir Henry nodded

Ill see him presently Shut him up somewhere where he can smoke

The young man withdrew carefully closing the door around which Sir
Henry with a word of apology arranged a screen

I dont think he explained that eavesdropping extends to these
premises or that our voices could reach outside Still a haporth of
prevention eh Have a cigar Horridge

Im not smoking for a day or two thank you sir

You look as though theyd put you through it Sir Henry remarked

His visitor smiled

Ive travelled fourteen miles in a barrel he said and we were
out for twentyfour hours in a Danish sailing skiff You know what the
weathers been like in the North Sea Before that the last word of
writing I saw on German soil was a placard offering a reward of five
thousand marks for my detention with a disgustingly lifelike photograph
at the top I had about fifty yards of quay to walk in broad daylight
and every other man I passed turned to stare after me It gives you the
cold shivers down your back when you darent look round to see if youre
being followed

Sir Henry groped in the cupboard of his desk and produced a bottle of
whisky and a syphon of soda water His visitor nodded approvingly

Ive touched nothing until Ive reached what I consider sanctuary he
observed My nerves have gone rotten for the first time in my life Do
you mind sir if I lock the door

Go ahead Sir Henry assented

He brought the whisky and soda himself across the room Horridge resumed
his seat and held out his hand almost eagerly For a moment or two he
shook as though he had an ague Then just as suddenly as it had come
upon him the fit passed He drained the contents of the tumbler at a
gulp set it down empty by his side and stretched out his hand for a
cigar

The end of my journey didnt help matters any he went on I darent
even make for a Dutch port and we were picked up eventually by a tramp
steamer from Newcastle to London with coals I hadnt been on board more
than an hour before a submarine which had been following overhauled us
I thought it was all up then but the fog lifted and we found ourselves
almost in the midst of a squadron of destroyers from Harwich I made
another transfer and they landed me in time to catch the early morning
train from Felixstowe

Did they get the submarine his listener asked eagerly

Get it the other repeated with a smile They blew it into scrap
metal

Plenty of movement in your life

Ive run the gauntlet over there once too often Horridge said grimly
Just look at me now Sir Henry Im twentynine years old and its
only two years and a half since I was invalided out of the navy and
took this job on The last person I asked to guess my age put me down at
fifty What should you have said

Somewhere near it was the candid admission Never mind Horridge
youve done your bit You shall pass on your experience to a new hand
take your pension and try the south coast of England for a few months
Now lets get on with it You know what I want to hear about

Horridge produced from his pocket a long strip of paper

Theyre there sir he announced coaled to the scuppers every man
standing to stations and steam up Theres the list

He handed the paper across to Sir Henry who glanced it down

The fast cruiser squadron he observed Hm Three new ships we
havent any note of No transports then Horridge

Not a sign of one sir was the reply Theyre after a bombardment

He rose to his feet walked to a giant map of England and touched a
certain port on the east coast Sir Henrys eyes glistened

Youre sure

It is a certainty Horridge replied Ive been on three of those
ships Ive dined with four of the officers Theyre under sealed
orders and the crew believes that theyre going to escort out half
a dozen commerce destroyers But I have the truth Thats their
objective Horridge repeated touching once more the spot upon the map
and they are waiting just for one thing

Sir Henry smiled thoughtfully

I know what theyre waiting for he said Perhaps if theyd a Herr
Horridge to send over here for it theyd have got it before now As
it iswell Im not sure he went on It seems a pity to disappoint
them doesnt it Id love to give them a run for their money

Horridge smiled faintly He knew a good deal about his companion

Theyre spoiling for it sir he admitted Sir Henry spoke down a
telephone and a few minutes later Ensol reappeared

Find Mr Horridge a comfortable room his chief directed and one of
our confidential typists You can make out your report at your leisure
he went on Come in and see me when its all finished

Certainly sir Horridge replied rising

Sir Henry held out his hand He looked with something like wonder at
the nerveshattered man who had risen to his feet with a certain air of
briskness

Horridge he said I wish I had your pluck

I dont know any one in the service from whom you need borrow any
sir was the quiet reply



CHAPTER XIX


Lessingham sat upon a fallen tree on Dutchmans Common near the scene
of his romantic descent and looked rather ruefully over the moorland
seawards Above him the sky was covered with little masses of quickly
scudding clouds A fugitive and watery sunshine shone feebly upon a
windtossed sea and a rainsodden landscape He found a certain grim
satisfaction in comparing the disorderliness of the day with the tumult
in his own life He felt that he had embarked upon an enterprise greater
than his capacity for which he was in many ways entirely unsuitable
And behind him was the scourge of the telegram which he had received a
few hours ago a telegram harmless enough to all appearance but which
decoded was like a scourge to his back

Your work is unsatisfactory and your slackness deserves reprobation
Great events wait upon you The object of your search is necessary for
our imminent operations

The sound of a horses hoofs disturbed him Captain Griffiths on a
great bay mare glanced curiously at the lonely figure by the roadside
and then pulled up

Back again Mr Lessingham he remarked

As you see

The Commandant fidgeted with his horse for a moment Then he approached
a little nearer to Lessinghams side

You are a good walker I perceive Mr Lessingham he remarked

When the fancy takes me was the equable reply

Have you come out to see our new guns

I had no idea Lessingham answered indifferently that you had any

Griffiths smiled

We have a small battery of antiaircraft guns newly arrived from
the south of England he said The secret of their coming and their
locality has kept the neighbourhood in a state of ferment for the last
week

Lessingham remained profoundly uninterested

They most of them spotted the guns his companion continued but not
many of them have found the searchlights yet

It seems a little late in the year Lessingham observed to be making
preparations against Zeppelins

Well they cross here pretty often you know Griffiths reminded him
Its only a matter of a few weeks ago that one almost came to grief
on this common We picked up their observation car not fifty yards from
where you are sitting

I remember hearing about it Lessingham acknowledged

Bytheby the Commandant continued smoothing his horses neck
didnt you arrive that evening or the evening after

I believe I did

Liverpool Street or Kings Cross The Kings Cross train was very
nearly held up

I didnt come by train at all Lessingham replied glancing for a
moment into the clouds And now I come to think of it it must have
been the evening after

Fine county for motoring Griffiths continued stroking his horses
head

The roads I have been on seem very good was the somewhat bored
admission

You havent a car of your own here have you

Not at present

Captain Griffiths glanced between his horses ears for a few moments
Then he turned once more towards his companion

Mr Lessingham he said you are aware that I am Commandant here

I believe Lessingham replied that Lady Cranston told me so

It is my duty therefore Griffiths went on to take a little more
than ordinary interest in casual visitors especially at this time
of the year The fact that you are wellknown to Lady Cranston is of
course an entirely satisfactory explanation of your presence here
At the same time there is certain information concerning strangers of
which we keep a record and in your case there is a line or two which we
have not been able to fill up

If I can be of any service Lessingham murmured

Precisely the other interrupted I knew you would feel like that
Now your arrival herewe have the date I thinkOctober 6th As you
have just remarked you didnt come by train How did you come

Lessinghams surprise was apparently quite genuine

Is that a question which you ask me to answerofficially he
enquired

His interlocutor shrugged his shoulders

I am not putting official questions to you at all he replied nor
am I crossexamining you as might be my duty under the circumstances
simply because your friendship with the Cranstons is of course a
guarantee as to your position But on the other hand I think it would
be reasonable if you were to answer my question

Lessingham nodded

Perhaps you are right he admitted As you can tell by finding me
here this afternoon I am a great walker I arrivedon foot

I see Griffiths reflected The other question which we usually ask
is where was your last stopping place

Stopping place Lessingham murmured

Yes where did you sleep the night before you came here Griffiths
persisted

Lessingham shook his head as though oppressed by some distasteful
memory

But I did not sleep at all he complained It was one of the worst
nights which I have ever spent in my life

Captain Griffiths gathered up his reins

Well he said with clumsy sarcasm I am much obliged to you Mr
Lessingham for the straightforward way in which you have answered my
questions I wont bother you any more just at present Shall I see you
tomorrow night at Mainsail Haul

Lady Cranston has asked me to dine was the somewhat reserved reply

His inquisitor nodded and cantered away Lessingham looked after him
until he had disappeared then he turned his face towards Dreymarsh and
walked steadily into the lowering afternoon Twilight was falling as
he reached Mainsail Haul where he found Philippa entertaining some
callers to whom she promptly introduced him Lessingham gathered
almost in the first few minutes that his presence in Dreymarsh was
becoming a subject of comment

My husband has played bridge with you at the club I think a lady
by whose side he found himself observed You perhaps didnt hear my
nameMrs Johnson

I congratulate you upon your husband Lessingham replied I remember
him perfectly well because he kept his temper when I revoked

Dear me she exclaimed He must have taken a fancy to you then As a
rule they rather complain about him at bridge

I formed the impression Lessingham continued that he was rather a
better player than the majority of the performers there

Mrs Johnson who was a dark and somewhat forbiddinglooking lady
smiled

He thinks so at any rate she conceded Didnt he tell me that you
were invalided home from the front

Lessingham shook his head

I am quite sure that it was not mentioned he said We walked home
together as far as the hotel one evening but we spoke only of the golf
and some shooting in the neighbourhood

Philippa who had been maneuvering to attract Lessinghams attention
suddenly dropped the cake basket which she was passing There was a
little commotion Lessingham went down on his hands and knees to help
collect the fragments and she found an opportunity to whisper in his
ear

Be careful That woman is a cat Stay and talk to me Please dont
bother Mr Lessingham Wont you ring the bell instead she continued
raising her voice

Lessingham did as he was asked and affected not to notice Mrs
Johnsons inviting smile as he returned Philippa made room for him by
her side

Helen and I were talking this afternoon Mr Lessingham she said of
the days when you and Dick were both in the Magdalen Eleven and both
had just a chance of being chosen for the Varsity You never played did
you

He shook his head

No such luck In any case Richard would have been in well before me I
always maintained that he was the first of our googlie bowlers

So you were at Magdalen with Major Felstead another caller remarked
in mild wonder

Mr Lessingham and my brother were great friends Philippa explained
Mr Lessingham used to come down to shoot in Cheshire

Lady Cranstons guests were all conscious of a little indefinable
disappointment The gossip concerning this strangers appearance in
Dreymarsh was practically strangled Mrs Johnson however fired a
parting shot as she rose to go

You were not in the same regiment as Major Felstead were you Mr
Lessingham she asked No he answered calmly

Philippa was busy with her adieux Mrs Johnson remained indomitable

What was your regiment Mr Lessingham she persisted You must
forgive my seeming inquisitive but I am so interested in military
affairs

Lessingham bowed courteously

I do not remember alluding to my soldiering at all he said coolly
but as a matter of fact I am in the Guards

Mrs Johnson accepted Philippas hand and the inevitable Her goodby to
Lessingham was most affable She walked up the road with the vicar

I think Vicar she said severely that for a small place Dreymarsh
is becoming one of the worst centres of gossip I ever knew Every one
has been saying all sorts of unkind things about that charming Mr
Lessingham and there you areMajor Felsteads friend and a Guardsman
Somehow or other I felt that he belonged to one of the crack regiments
I shall certainly ask him to dinner one night next week

The vicar nodded benignly He had the utmost respect for Mrs Johnsons
cook and his own standard of social desirability to which the object
of their discussion had attained

I should be happy to meet Mr Lessingham at any time he pronounced
with ample condescension I noticed him in church last Sunday morning



CHAPTER XX


My dear man whatever shall I do with you Philippa exclaimed
pathetically as the door closed upon the last of her callers The
Guards indeed

Lessingham smiled as he resumed his place by her side

Well he said I told the dear lady the truth You will find my
name well up in the list of the thirtyfirst battalion of the Prussian
Guards

She threw herself back in her chair and laughed How amusing it would
be if it werent all so terrible You really are a perfect political
Raffles Do you know that this afternoon you have absolutely
reestablished yourself Mr Johnson will probably call on you
tomorrowthey may even ask you to dinethe vicar will write and ask
for a subscription and Dolly Fenwick will invite you to play golf with
her

Do not turn my head he begged

All the same Philippa continued more gravely I shall never have
a moments peace whilst you are in the place I was thinking about you
last night I dont believe I have ever realised before how terrible it
would be if you really were discovered What would they do to you

Whatever they might do he replied a little wearily I must obey
orders My orders are to remain here but even if I were told that I
might go I should find it hard

Do you mean that she asked

I think you know he answered

You men are so strange she went on after a moments pause You give
us so little time to know you you show us so little of yourselves and
you expect so much

We offer everything he reminded her

I want to avoid platitudes she said thoughtfully but is love quite
the same thing for a man as for a woman

Sometimes it is more was the prompt reply Sometimes love for a
woman means only shelter often for a man love means the blending of
all knowledge of all beauty all ambition of all that he has learned
from books and from life Sometimes a man can see no further and needs
to look no further

Philippa suddenly felt that she was in danger There was something in
her heart of which she had never before been conscious some music some
strange turn of sentiment in Lessinghams voice or the words themselves
It was madness she told herself breathlessly She was in love with
her husband if any one She could not have lost all feeling for him so
soon She clasped her hands tightly Lessingham seemed conscious of his
advantage and leaned towards her

If I were not offering you my whole life he pleaded believe me I
would not open my lips If I were thinking of episodes I would throw
myself into the sea before I asked you to give me even your fingers But
you and you alone could fill the place in my life which I have always
prayed might be filled not for a year or even a decade of years but
for eternity

Oh but you forget she faltered

I remember so much he replied that I know it is hard for you to
speak There are bonds which you have made sacred and your
fingers shrink from tearing them asunder If it were not for this
Philippahear the speech of a renegademy mandate should be torn in
pieces My instructions should flutter into the wastepaper basket
Tomorrow should see us on our way to a new country and a new life But
you must be very sure indeed

Is it because of me that you are staying here she asked

Upon my honour no he assured her I must stay here a little longer
whatever it may mean for me And so I am content to remain what I am to
you at this minute I ask from you only that you remain just what you
are But when the moment of my freedom comes when my task here is
finished and I turn to go then I must come to you

She rose suddenly to her feet crossed the floor and threw open the
window The breeze swept through the room flapping the curtains
blowing about loose articles into a strange confusion She stood there
for several moments as though in search of some respite from the
emotional atmosphere upon which she had turned her back When she
finally closed the window her hair was in little strands about her
face Her eyes were soft and her lips quivering

You make me feel she said taking his hand for a moment and looking
at him almost piteously you make me feel everything except one thing

Except one thing he repeated

Cant you understand she continued stretching out her hand with a
quick impulsive little movement I am here in Henrys house his wife
the mistress of his household All the years weve been married I have
never thought of another man I have never indulged in even the idlest
flirtation And now suddenly my life seems upside down I feel as
though if Henry stood before me now I would strike him on the cheek I
feel sore all over and ashamed but I dont know whether I have ceased
to love him I cant tell Nothing seems to help me I close my eyes
and I try to think of that new world and that new life and I know that
there is nothing repulsive in it I feel all the joy and the strength of
being with you And then there is Henry in the background He seems to
have had so much of my love

He saw the tears gathering in her eyes and he smiled at her
encouragingly

Remember that at this moment I am asking you for nothing he said
Just think these things out It isnt really a matter for sorrow he
continued Love must always mean happinessfor the one who is loved

She leaned back in the corner of the sofa to which he had led her
her eyes dry now but still very soft and sweet He sat by her side
fingering some of the things in her work basket Once she held out her
hand and seemed to find comfort in his clasp He raised her fingers to
his lips without any protest from her She looked at him with a little
smile

You know Im not at all an Ibsen heroine she declared I cant see
my way like those wonderful emancipated women

Yet he said thoughtfully the way to the simple things is so clear

Confidences were at an end for a time broken up by the entrance of Nora
and Helen and some young men from the Depot who had looked in for a
game of billiards Lessingham rose to leave as soon as the latter had
returned to their game His tone and manner now were completely changed
He seemed ill at ease and unhappy

I am going to have a days fishing tomorrow he told Philippa but
I must admit that I have very little faith in this man Oates They all
tell me that your husband has any number of charts of the coast Do you
think I could borrow one

Why of course she replied if we can find it

She took him over to her husbands desk opened such of the drawers as
were not locked and searched amongst their contents ruthlessly By the
time they had finished the last drawer Lessingham had quite a little
collection of charts more or less finished in his hand

I dont know where else to look she said You might go through those
and see if they are of any use What is it Mills she added turning
to the door

Mills had entered noiselessly and was watching the proceedings at Sir
Henrys desk with a distinct lack of favour He looked away towards his
mistress however as he replied

The young woman has called with reference to a situation as
parlourmaid your ladyship he announced I have shown her into the
sewing room Lady Cranston glanced at the clock

I shant be more than five or ten minutes she promised Lessingham
Just look through those till I come back

She hurried away leaving Lessingham alone in the room He stood for a
moment listening On the lefthand side through the door which had
been left ajar he could hear the click of billiard balls and occasional
peals of laughter On the righthand side there was silence He moved
swiftly across the room and closed the door leading into the billiard
room deposited on the sofa the charts which he had been carrying and
hurried back to the secretary With a sickening feeling of overwhelming
guilt he drew from his pocket a key and opened one by one the drawers
through which they had not searched It took him barely five minutes to
discovernothing With an air of relief he rearranged everything
When Philippa returned he was sitting on the lounge going through the
charts which they had looked out together

Well she asked

There is nothing here he decided which will help me very much With
your permission I will take this he added selecting one at random

She nodded and they replaced the others Then she touched him on the
arm

Listen she said are you perfectly certain that there is no one
coming

He listened for a moment

I cant hear any one he answered Theyve started a fourhanded game
of pool in the billiard room

She smiled

Then I will disclose to you Henrys dramatic secret See

She touched the spring in the side of the secretary The false back
with its little collection of fishing flies rolled slowly up The large
and very wonderful chart on which Sir Henry had bestowed so much of his
time was revealed Lessingham gazed at it eagerly

There she said That has been a great labour of love with Henry
It is the chart on a great scale from which he works I dont know
a thing about it and for heavens sake never tell Henry that you have
seen it

He continued to examine the chart earnestly Not a part of it escaped
him Then he turned back to Philippa

Is that supposed to be the coast on the other side of the point he
asked

I dont exactly know where it is she replied Every time Henry finds
out anything new he comes and works at it I believe that very soon it
will be perfect Then he will start on another part of the coast

This is not the only one that he has prepared then Lessingham
enquired

She shook her head

I believe it is the fifth she replied They all disappear when they
are finished but I have no idea where to To me they seem to represent
a shocking waste of time

Lessingham was suddenly taciturn He held out his hand You are dining
with us tomorrow night remember she said

I am not likely to forget he assured her

And dont get drowned she concluded I dont know any of these
fishermenI hate them allbut Im told that Oates is the worst

I think that we shall be quite all right he assured her Thanks very
much for finding me the charts What I have seen will help me

Helen came in for a moment and their farewell was more or less
perfunctory Lessingham was almost thankful to escape There was an
unusual flush in his cheeks a sense of bitter humiliation in his heart
All the fervour with which he had started on his perilous quest had
faded away No sense of duty or patriotism could revive his drooping
spirits He felt himself suddenly an unclean and dishonoured being



CHAPTER XXI


Towards three oclock on the following afternoon the boisterous wind
of an uncertain morning settled down to worse things It tore the spray
from the crest of the gathering waves dashed it even against the
French windows of Mainsail Haul and came booming down the open spaces
cliffwards like the rumble of some subterranean artillery A little
group of fishermen in oilskins leaned over the railing and discussed
the chances of Ben Oates bringing his boat in safely Philippa also
distracted by a curious anxiety stood before the blurred window
gazing into what seemed almost a grey chaos Captain Griffiths your
ladyship

She turned around quickly at the announcement Even an unwelcome caller
at that moment was almost a relief to her

How nice of you to come and see me on such an afternoon Captain
Griffiths she exclaimed as they shook hands Helen is over at the
Canteen Nora is hard at work for once in her life and I seem most
dolefully alone

Her visitors reception of Philippas greeting promised little in the
way of enlivenment He seemed more awkward and ill at ease than ever
and his tone was almost threatening

I am very glad to find you alone Lady Cranston he said I came
specially to have a few words with you on a certain matter

Her momentary impulse of relief at his visit passed away There seemed
to her something sinister in his manner She was suddenly conscious that
there was a new danger to be faced and that this mans attitude towards
her was for some reason or other inimical After the first shock
however she prepared herself to do battle

Well you seem very mysterious she observed I havent broken any
laws have I No lights flashing from any of my windows

So far as I am aware there are no complaints of the sort the
Commandant acknowledged still speaking with an unnatural restraint My
call I hope may be termed to some extent at least a friendly one

How nice she sighed Then youll have some tea wont you

Not at present if you please he begged I have come to talk to you
about Mr Hamar Lessingham

Really Philippa exclaimed Whatever has that poor man been doing
now

Dreymarsh her visitor proceeded having been constituted during the
last few months a protected area it is my duty to examine and enquire
into the business of any stranger who appears here Mr Hamar Lessingham
has been largely accepted without comment owing to his friendship with
you I regret to state however that certain facts have come to my
knowledge which make me wonder whether you yourself may not in some
measure have been deceived

This sounds very ridiculous Philippa interposed quietly

A few weeks ago Captain Griffith continued we received information
that this neighbourhood would probably be visited by some person
connected with the Secret Service of Germany There is strong evidence
that the person in question is Mr Hamar Lessingham

A graduate of Magdalen my brothers intimate friend and a frequent
visitor at my fathers house in Cheshire Philippa observed with faint
sarcasm

The possibility of your having made a mistake Lady Cranston Captain
Griffiths rejoined has I must confess only just occurred to me The
authorities at Magdalen College have been appealed to and no one of the
name of Lessingham was there during any one of your brothers terms

Philippa took the blow well She simply stared at her caller in a
noncomprehending manner

We have also information he continued gravely from Wood Norton
Hallfrom your mother in fact Lady Cranstonthat no college friend
of your brother of that name has ever visited Wood Norton

Go on Philippa begged a little faintly Did I ever live there
myself Was Richard ever at Magdalen

Captain Griffiths proceeded with the air of a man who has a task to
finish and intends to do so regardless of interruptions

I have had some conversation with Mr Lessingham in the course of
which I asked him to explain his method of reaching here and his last
habitation He simply fenced with me in the most barefaced fashion He
practically declined to give me any account of himself

Philippa rose and rang the bell

I suppose I must give you some tea she said although you seem to
have come here on purpose to make my head ache

My object in coming here Captain Griffiths rejoined a little
stiffly is to save you some measure of personal annoyance

Oh please dont think that I am ungrateful Philippa begged Of
course it is all some absurd mistake and Im sure we shall get to the
bottom of it presentlyTell me what you think of the storm she added
as Mills entered with the tea tray Do you think it will get any worse
because I am terrified to death already

I am no judge of the weather here he confessed I believe the
fishermen are preparing for something unusual

She seated herself before the tea tray and insisted upon performing
her duties as hostess Afterwards she laid her hand upon his arm and
addressed him with an air of complete candour

Now Captain Griffiths she began do listen to me Just one moment
of common sense if you please What do you suppose there could possibly
be in our harmless seaside village to induce any one to risk his life by
coming here on behalf of the Secret Service of Germany

Dreymarsh Captain Griffiths replied was not made a prohibited area
for nothing

But my dear man be reasonable Philippa persisted There are
perhaps a thousand soldiers in the place the usual preparations along
the cliff for coast defence a small battery of antiaircraft guns and
a couple of searchlights There isnt a grocers boy in the place who
doesnt know all this Theres no concealment about it You must
admit that Germany doesnt need to send over a Secret Service agent to
acquaint herself with these insignificant facts

Her visitor smiled very faintly It was the first time he had relaxed
even so far as this

I am not in possession of any information which I can impart to you
Lady Cranston he said but I am not prepared to accept your statement
that Dreymarsh contains nothing of greater interest than the things
which you have mentioned

There was no necessity for Philippa to play a part now The suggestion
contained in her visitors words had really left her in a state of
wonder

You are making my flesh creep she exclaimed You dont mean to say
that we have secrets here

I have said the last word which it is possible for me to say upon the
subject he declared You will understand I am sure that I am not
here in the character of an inquisitor I simply thought it my duty in
view of the fact that you had made yourself the social sponsor for
Mr Lessingham to place certain information before you and to ask
unofficially of course if you have any explanation to give You may
even he went on hesitatingly appreciate the motives which led me to
do so

My dear man what explanation could I have Philippa protested it is
an absolute and undeniable fact that Mr Lessingham was at Magdalen
with my brother and also that he visited us at Wood Norton I know
both these things of my own knowledge The only possible explanation
therefore is that you have been misinformed

Or Captain Griffiths ventured that Mr Hamar Lessingham in those
days passed under another name

Another name Philippa faltered

Some such name perhaps he continued as Bertram Maderstrom

There was a short silence Captain Griffiths had leaned back in his
chair and was caressing his upper lip His eyes were fixed upon Philippa
and Philippa saw nothing Her little heel dug hard into the carpet In a
few seconds the room ceased to spin Nevertheless her voice sounded to
her pitifully inadequate

What an absurdity all this is she exclaimed

Maderstrom Captain Griffiths said thoughtfully was curiously
enough an intimate college friend of your brothers He was also a
visitor at Wood Norton Hall At neither place is there any trace of
Mr Hamar Lessingham Perhaps you have made a mistake Lady Cranston
Perhaps you have recognised the man and failed to remember his name If
so now is the moment to declare it

I am very much obliged to you Philippa retorted but I have never
met or heard of this Mr Maderstrom

Baron Maderstrom he interrupted

Baron Maderstrom then in my life whereas Mr Lessingham I remember
perfectly

I am sorry Captain Griffiths said setting down his empty teacup and
rising slowly to his feet We cannot help one another then

If you want me to transfer Mr Lessingham whom I remember perfectly
into a German baron whom I never heard of Philippa declared boldly I
am afraid that we cant

Baron Maderstrom was a Swedish nobleman Captain Griffiths observed

Swedish or German I know nothing of him Philippa persisted

There remains then nothing more to be said

I am afraid not Philippa agreed sweetly

Under the circumstances Captain Griffiths asked you will not I am
sure expect me to dine tonight

Not if you object to meeting Mr Hamar Lessingham Philippa replied

Her visitors face suddenly darkened and Philippa wondered vaguely
whether anything more than professional suspicion was responsible
for that little storm of passion which for a moment transformed his
appearance He quickly recovered however

I may still he concluded moving towards the door be forced to
present myself here in another capacity



CHAPTER XXII


The confinement of the house after the departure of her unwelcome
visitor stifled Philippa Attired in a mackintosh with a scarf around
her head she made her way on to the quay and clinging to the railing
dragged herself along to where the fishermen were gathered together in a
little group The storm as yet showed no signs of abatement

Has anything been heard of Ben Oates boat she enquired

An old fisherman pointed seawards

There she comes maam up on the crest of that wave look

Will she get in Philippa asked eagerly

There were varied opinions expressed in indistinct mutterings

Shes weathering it grand the fisherman to whom she had first spoken
declared Weve a line ready yonder and were reckoning on getting em
ashore all right Lucky for Ben that the gentleman along with him is a
fine sailor Look at that mum he added in excitement See the way he
brought her head round to it just in time Boys theyll come in on the
next one

One by one the sailors made their way to the very edge of the
wavesplashed beach There were a few more minutes of breathless
anxiety Then after the boat had disappeared completely from sight
hidden by a huge grey wall of sea she seemed suddenly to climb to the
top of it to hover there to become mixed up with the spray and the
surf and a great green mass of waters and then finally with a harsh
crash of timbers and a shout from the fishermen to be flung high and
dry upon the stones Philippa clutching the iron railing saw for a
moment nothing but chaos Her knees became weak She was unable to move
There was a queer dizziness in her ears The sound of voices sounded
like part of an unreal nightmare Then she was aware of a single figure
climbing the steps towards her There was blood trickling down his face
from the wound in the forehead and he was limping slightly

Mr Lessingham she called out as he reached the topmost step

He took an eager step towards her

Philippa he exclaimed Why what are you doing here

I was frightened she faltered Are you hurt

Not in the least he assured her We had a rough sail home thats
all and that fellow Oates drank himself half unconscious Come along
let me help you up the steps and out of this

She clung to his arm and they struggled up the private path to the
house Mills let them in with many expressions of concern and Helen
came hurrying to them from the background

I went out to see the storm Philippa explained weakly and I saw Mr
Lessinghams boat brought in

And Mr Lessingham will come this way at once Helen insisted I
havent had a real case since I got my certificate and Im going to
bind his head up

Philippa began to feel her strength returning The horror which lay
behind those few minutes of nightmare rose up again in her mind Mills
had hurried on into the bathroom and the other two were preparing to
follow She stopped them

Mr Lessingham she said listen Captain Griffiths has been here He
knows or guesses everything

Everything

Philippa nodded

Helen must bind your head up of course she continued After that
think What can we do Captain Griffiths knows that there was no Hamar
Lessingham at college with Dick that he never visited Wood Norton that
there is some mystery about your arrival here and he told me to my face
that he believes you to be Bertram Maderstrom

What a meddlesome fellow Lessingham grumbled holding his
handkerchief to his forehead

Oh please be serious Helen begged looking up from the bandage which
she was preparing This is horrible

Dont I know it Philippa groaned Mr Lessingham you must please
try and escape from here You can have the car if you like There must
be some place where you can go and hide until you can get away from the
country

But Im dining here tonight Lessingham protested Im not going to
hide anywhere

The two women exchanged glances of despair

Cant I make you understand Philippa exclaimed pathetically Youre
in danger herereally in danger

Lessinghams demeanour showed no appreciation of the situation

Of course I can quite understand he said that Griffiths is
suspicious about me but after all no one can prove that I have broken
the law here and I shall not make things any better by attempting an
opera bouffe flight Can I have my head tied up and come and talk to you
about it later on

Oh if you like Philippa assented weakly I cant argue

She made her way up to her room and changed her wet clothes When she
came down Lessingham was standing on the hearth rug in the library
with a piece of buttered toast in one hand and a cup of tea in the
other His head was very neatly bound up and he seemed quite at his
ease

You know he began as he wheeled a chair up to the fire for her
that man Griffiths doesnt like me He never took to me from the first
I could see that If it comes to that I dont like Griffiths He is
one of those mean suspicious sort of characters we could very well do
without

Philippa who had rehearsed a little speech several times in her
bedroom tried to be firm

Mr Lessingham she said you know that we are both your friends Do
listen please Captain Griffiths is Commandant here and in a position
of authority He has a very large power I honestly believe that it is
his intention to have you arrestedif not tonight within a very few
days

I do not see how he can Lessingham objected helping himself to
another piece of toast I have committed no crime here I have played
golf with all the respectable old gentlemen in the place and I have
given the committee some excellent advice as to the two new holes I
have played bridge down at the clubwe will call it bridgeand I
have kept my temper like an angel I have dined at Mess and told them at
least a dozen new stories I have kept my blinds drawn at night and I
have not a wireless secreted up the chimney I really cannot see what
they could do to me

Philippa tried bluntness

You have served in the German army and you are living in a protected
area under a false name she declared

Well of course there is some truth in what you say he admitted
but even if they have tumbled to that and can prove it I should do no
good by running away To be perfectly serious he added setting his
cup down there is only one thing at the present moment which would
take me out of Dreymarsh and that is if you believe that my presence
here would further compromise you and Miss Fairclough

Philippa was beginning to find her courage Were in it already up to
the neck she observed I really dont see that anything matters so
far as we are concerned

In that case he decided I shall have the honour of presenting
myself at the usual time



CHAPTER XXIII


Philippa and Helen met in the drawingroom a few minutes before
eight that evening Philippa was wearing a new black dress a model of
simplicity to the untutored eye but full of that undefinable appeal to
the mysterious which even the greatest artist frequently fails to create
out of any form of colour Some fancy had induced her to strip off her
jewels at the last moment and she wore no ornaments save a band of
black velvet around her neck Helen looked at her curiously

Is this a fresh scheme for conquest Philippa she asked as they
stood together by the log fire

Philippa unexpectedly flushed

I dont know what I was thinking about really she confessed Is
that the exact time I wonder

Two minutes to eight Helen replied

Mr Lessingham is always so punctual Philippa murmured I wonder if
Captain Griffiths would dare

Weve done our best to warn him Helen reminded her friend The man
is simply pigheaded

I cant help feeling that hes right Philippa declared when he
argues that they couldnt really prove anything against him

Does that matter Helen asked anxiously so long as he is an enemy
living under a false name here

You dont think theydtheyd

Shoot him Helen whispered lowering her voice They couldnt do
that They couldnt do that

The clock began to chime Suddenly Philippa who had been listening
gave a little exclamation of relief

I hear his voice she exclaimed Thank goodness

Helens relief was almost as great as her companions A moment later
Mills ushered in their guest He was still wearing his bandage but his
colour had returned He seemed in fact almost gay

Nothing has happened then Philippa demanded anxiously as soon as
the door was closed

Nothing at all he assured them Our friend Griffiths is terribly
afraid of making a mistake

So afraid that he wouldnt come and dine Never mind youll have to
take care of us both she added as Mills announced dinner

Ill do my best he promised offering his arm

If the sword of Damocles were indeed suspended over their heads it
seemed only to heighten the merriment of their little repast Philippa
had ordered champagne and the warmth of the pleasant dining room the
many appurtenances of luxury by which they were surrounded the glow of
the wine and the perfume of the hothouse flowers upon the table seemed
in delicious contrast to the fury of the storm outside They all three
appeared completely successful in a strenuous effort to dismiss all
disconcerting subjects from their minds Lessingham talked chiefly of
the East He had travelled in Russia Persia Afghanistan and India
and he had the unusual but striking gift of painting little word
pictures of some of the scenes of his wanderings It was halfpast nine
before they rose from the table and Lessingham accompanied them into
the library With the advent of coffee they were for the first time
really alone Lessingham sat by Philippas side and Helen reclined in a
low chair close at hand

I think he said that I can venture now to tell you some news

Helen put down her work Philippa looked at him in silence and her eyes
seemed to dilate

I have hesitated to say anything about it Lessingham went on
because there is so much uncertainty about these things but I believe
that it is now finally arranged I think that within the next week or
ten daysperhaps a little before perhaps a little lateryour brother
Richard will be set at liberty

Dick Dick coming home Philippa cried springing up from her
reclining position

Dick Helen faltered her work lying unheeded in her lap Mr
Lessingham do you mean it Is it possible

It is not only possible Lessingham assured them but I believe that
it will come to pass I have had to exercise a little duplicity but
I fancy that it has been successful I have insisted that without help
from an influential person in Dreymarsh I cannot bring my labours here
to a satisfactory conclusion and I have named as the price of that
help Richards absolute and immediate freedom I heard only this
morning that there would be no difficulty

Helen snatched up her work and groped her way towards the door

I will come back in a few minutes she promised her voice a little
broken

Lessingham who had opened the door for her returned to his place
There were no tears in Philippas brilliant eyes but there was a faint
patch of colour in her cheeks and her lips were not quite steady She
caught at his hands

Oh my dear dear friend she said If only that little nightmare
part of you did not exist If only you could be just what you seem and
one could feel that you were there in our lives for always I feel that
I want to talk to you so much to you and not the sham you What shall I
call you

Bertram please he whispered

Then Bertram dear she went on for my sake because you have really
become dear to me because my heart aches at the thought of your danger
and becausesee how honest I amI am a little afraid of myselfwill
you go away The thought of your danger is like a nightmare to me It
all seems so absurd and unreasonableI mean that the danger which I
fear should be hanging over you But I think that there is just a little
something back of your brain of which you have never spoken which it
was your duty to keep to yourself and it is just that something which
brings the danger

I am not afraid for myself Philippa he told her I took a false
step in life when I came here What it was that attracted me I do not
know I think it was the thought of that wild ride amongst the
clouds and the starlight It seemed such a wonderful beginning to any
enterprise And Philippa for one part of my adventure the part which
concerns you it was a gorgeous prelude and for the otherwell it
just does not count because I have no fear I have faith in my fortune
do you know that I believe that I shall leave this place unharmed but
I believe that if I leave it without you I shall go back to the worst
hell in which a man could ever

Bertram she pleaded think of it all Even if I cared enoughand I
dontthere is something unnatural about it Doesnt it strike you as
horrible My brother my cousins my father are all fighting the men of
the nation whose cause you have espoused There is a horrible eternal
cloud of hatred which it will take generations to get rid of if ever it
disappears How can we two speak of love What part of the world could
we creep into where people would not shrink away from us I may have
lost a little of my heart to you Bertram I may miss you when you go
away I may waste weary hours thinking but that is all Oh you know
that it must be all

I do not he answered stubbornly

Oh you must be reasonable she begged with a little break in her
voice You know very well that I ought not to listen to you I ought
not to welcome you here I ought to be strong and close my ears

But you will not do that

No she faltered Please dont come any nearer I

She broke off suddenly The struggle in her face was ended her
expression transformed Her finger was held up as though to bid him
listen With her other hand she clutched the back of the couch Her eyes
were fixed upon the door The little patch of wonderful colour faded
from her cheeks

Listen she cried with a note of terror in her voice That was the
front door Some one has come Cant you hear them

Lessinghams hand stole suddenly to his pocket She caught the glitter
of something half withdrawn and shrank back with a halfstifled moan

Not before you dear he promised Please do not be afraid If this
is the end leave me alone with Griffiths I shall not hurt him I
shall not forget And if by any chance he added this is to be our
farewell Philippa you will remember that I love you as the flowers of
the world love their sun Courage

The door facing them was opened

Captain Griffiths Mills announced

Through the open door they caught a vision of two other soldiers and
Inspector Fisher Griffiths came into the room alone however and
waited until the door was closed before he spoke He carried himself
as awkwardly as ever but his long lean face seemed to have taken
to itself a new expression He had the air of a man indulging in some
strange pleasure

Lady Cranston he said I am very sorry to intrude but my visit here
is official

What is it she asked hoarsely

I have received confirmatory evidence in the matter of which I spoke to
you this afternoon he went on I am sorry to disturb you at such an
hour but it is my duty to arrest this man on a charge of espionage

Lessingham to all appearance remained unmoved

A most objectionable word he remarked

A most villainous profession Captain Griffiths retorted Thank
heaven that in this country we are learning the art of dealing with its
disciples

This is all a hideous mistake Philippa declared feverishly I assure
you that Mr Lessingham has visited my fathers house that he was
wellknown to me years ago

As the Baron Maderstrom What arguments he has used Lady Cranston to
induce you to accept him here under his new identity I do not know but
the facts are very clear

He seems quite convinced doesnt he Lessingham remarked turning to
Philippa And as I gather that a portion of the British Army assisted
by the local constabulary is waiting for me outside perhaps I had
better humour him

It would be as well sir Captain Griffiths assented grimly I am
glad to find you in the humour for jesting

Lessingham turned once more to Philippa This time his tone was more
serious

Lady Cranston he begged wont you please leave us

No she answered hysterically I know why you want me to and I wont
go You have done no harm and nothing shall happen to you I will not
leave the room and you shall not

His gesture of appeal coincided with the sob in her throat She broke
down in her speech and Captain Griffiths moved a step nearer

If you have any weapon in your possession sir he said you had
better hand it over to me

Well do you know Lessingham replied I scarcely see the necessity
One thing I will promise you he added with a sudden flash in his
eyes a single step nearera single step mindand you shall have
as much of my weapon as will keep you quiet for the rest of your life
Remember that so long as you are reasonable I do not threaten you Help
me to persuade Lady Cranston to leave us

Captain Griffiths was out of his depths He was not a coward but he had
no hankering after death and there was death in Lessinghams threat and
in the flash of his eyes While he hesitated there was a knock upon the
door Mills came silently in He carried a telegram upon a salver

For you sir he announced addressing Captain Griffiths An orderly
has just brought it down

Griffiths looked at the pink envelope and frowned He tore it open
however without a word As he read his long upper teeth closed
in upon his lip So he stood there until two little drops of blood
appeared

Then he turned to Mills

There is no answer he said

The man bowed and left the room He walked slowly and he looked back
from the doorway It was scarcely possible for even so perfectly trained
a servant to escape from the atmosphere of tragedy

Something tells me Lessingham remarked coolly as soon as the door
was closed that that message concerns me

The Commandant made no immediate reply He straightened out the telegram
and read it once more under the lamplight as though to be sure there
was no possible mistake Then he folded it up and placed it in his
waistcoat pocket

The notion of your arrest sir he said to Lessingham harshly is
apparently distasteful to some one at headquarters who has not digested
my information I am withdrawing my men for the present

Youre not going to arrest him Philippa cried

I am not Captain Griffiths answered But he added turning to
Lessingham this is only a respite I have more evidence behind all
that I have offered You are Baron Bertram Maderstrom a German spy
living here in a prohibited area under a false name That I know and
that I shall prove to those who have interfered with me in the execution
of my duty This is not the end

He left the room without even a word or a salute to Philippa Lessingham
looked after him for a moment thoughtfully Then he shrugged his
shoulders

I am quite sure that I do not like Captain Griffiths he declared
There is no breeding about the fellow



CHAPTER XXIV


Philippa even for some moments after the departure of Captain Griffiths
and his myrmidons remained in a sort of nerveless trance The crisis
with its bewildering denouement had affected her curiously Lessingham
rose presently to his feet

I wonder he asked if I could have a whisky and soda

She stamped her foot at him in a little fit of hysterical passion

Youre not natural she cried Whisky and soda

Well I dont know he protested mildly helping himself from the
table in the background I rather thought I was being particularly
British When in doubt take a drink That is Richard all the world
over you know

She broke into a little mirthless laugh

I shall begin to think that you are a poseur she exclaimed

He crossed the room towards her

Perhaps I am dear he confessed I want you just to sit up and lose
that unnatural look I am not really full of cheap bravado but I am a
philosopher Something has happened to postponethe end Good luck to
it I say

He raised his tumbler to his lips and set it down empty Philippa rose
to her feet and walked restlessly to the window and back

Ill try and be reasonable too she promised resuming her seat I
was right you see Captain Griffiths has discovered everything Can
you tell me what possible reason any one in London could have had for
interference

I seem to have got a friend up there without knowing it dont I he
observed

This is aging me terribly Philippa declared throwing herself back
into her seat All my life I have hated mysteries Here I am face to
face with two absolutely insoluble ones Captain Griffiths has assured
me that there is here in Dreymarsh something of sufficient importance to
account for the presence of a foreign spy You have confirmed it I have
been torturing my brain about that for the last twentyfour hours Now
there happens something more inexplicable still You are arrested and
you are not arrested Your identity is known and Captain Griffiths is
forbidden to do his duty

It seems puzzling does it not Lessingham agreed I shouldnt worry
about the first but this last little episode takes some explaining

If anything further happens this evening I think I shall go mad
Philippa sighed

And something is going to happen Lessingham declared rising to his
feet Did you hear that

Above even the roar of the wind they heard the brazen report of a gun
from almost underneath the window The room was suddenly lightened by a
single vivid flash

A mortar Lessingham exclaimed And that was a rocket unless Im
mistaken

The signal for the lifeboat Philippa announced I wonder if we can
see anything

She hastened towards the window but paused at the abrupt opening of the
door Nora burst in followed more sedately by Helen

Mummy theres a wreck the former cried in excitement I heard
something an hour ago and I got up and Ive been sitting by the
window watching I saw the lifeboat go out and theyre signalling now
for the other one

Its quite true Philippa Helen declared Were going to try and
fight our way down to the beach

Ill go too Lessingham decided Perhaps I may be of use

Well all go Philippa agreed Wait while I get my things on What
is it Mills she added as the door opened and the latter presented
himself

There is a trawler on the rocks just off the breakwater your
ladyship he announced They have just sent up from the beach to know
if we can take some of the crew in They are landing them as well as
they can on the line

Of course we can was the prompt reply Tell them to send as many as
they want to We will find room for them somehow Ill go upstairs and
see about the fires Youll all come back she added turning around

We will all come back Lessingham promised

They fought their way down to the beach At first the storm completely
deafened all sound The lanterns waved here and there by unseen hands
seemed part of some ghostly tableau of which the only background was
the raging of the storm Then suddenly with a startling hiss another
rocket clove its way through the darkness They had an instantaneous but
brilliant view of all that was happeningsaw the trawler lying on its
side apparently only a few yards from the shore saw the line stretched
to the beach on which even at that moment a man was being drawn
ashore licked by the spray his strained face and windtossed hair
clearly visible Then all was darkness again more complete than ever
They struggled down on to the shingle where the little cluster of
fishermen were hard at work with the line Almost the first person
they ran across was Jimmy Dumble He was standing on the edge of the
breakwater with a great lantern in his hand superintending the line
and as they drew near Lessingham who was a little in advance could
hear his voice above the storm He was shouting towards the wreck his
hand to his mouth

Send the master over next you lubbers or well cut the line Do you
hear

There was no reply or if there was it was drowned in the wind
Lessingham gripped the fisherman by the arm

Whom do you mean by master he demanded Dumble scarcely glanced at
his interlocutor

Why Sir Henry Cranston to be sure was the agitated answer These
lubbers of sea hands are all coming off first and the line wont stand
for more than another one or two he added dropping his voice

Then the thrill of those few minutes excitement unrolled itself into a
great drama before Lessinghams eyes Sir Henry was on that ship as near
as any man might wish to be to death

Eres the next Jimmy muttered as they turned the windlass
vigorously Gosh es a heavy one too

Then came a cry which sounded like a moan and above it the shrill
fearful yell of a man who feels himself dropping out of the worlds
hearing Lessingham raised the lantern which stood on the beach by
Jimmys side The line had broken The body of its suspended traveller
had disappeared And just then strangely enough for the first time for
over an hour the heavens opened in one great sheet of lightning
and they could see the figure of one man left on the ship clinging
desperately to the rigging

Tie the line around me Jimmy shouted Let her go Get the other end
on the windlass

They paid out the rope through their hands Jimmy kicked off his boots
and plunged into the cauldron He swam barely a dozen strokes before he
was caught on the top of an incoming wave tossed about like a cork and
flung back upon the beach where he lay groaning There was a little
murmur amongst the fisherman who rushed to lean over him

Swimming aint no more use than trying to walk on the water one of
them declared

Lessingham raised the lantern which he was carrying and flashed it
around

Where are the young ladies he asked

Gone up to the house with two as weve just taken off the wreck some
one informed him

Lessingham stooped down Willing hands helped him unfasten the cord from
Jimmys waist He tore off his own coat and waistcoat and boots Some
helped other sought to dissuade him as he secured the line around his
own waist

Weve sent for more rockets one man shouted in his ear The man will
be back in half an hour

Lessingham pushed them on one side He stood on the edge of the beach
and borrowing a lantern watched for his opportunity Then suddenly
he vanished They looked after him They could see nothing but the rope
slipping past their feet inch by inch Sometimes it was stationary
sometimes it was drawn taut The first great wave that came flung a yard
or so of slack amongst them Then after the roar of its breaking had
died away they saw the rope suddenly tighten and pass rapidly out and
the excitement began to thicken

That un didnt get him anyway one of them muttered

Hell go through the next with luck another declared hopefully

Lessingham fighting for his consciousness deafened and half stunned
by the roar of the waters about him still felt the exhilaration of
that great struggle He looked once into seas which seemed to touch the
clouds drew himself stiff and plunged into the depths of a mountain of
foaming waters whose summit seemed to him like one of those grotesque
and nightmaredistorted efforts of the opiumeating brain Then the roar
sounded all behind him and he knew that he was through the breakers
He swam to the side of the ship and clutched hold of a chain It was Sir
Henrys outstretched hand which pulled him on to the deck

My God that was a swim the latter declared as he pulled his rescuer
up not in the least recognising him Lets have the end of that cord
quick So he went on paying it out through his fingers until the end
of the rope appeared Youd better get your breath young man and then
over you go Ill follow

Im damned if I do was the vigorous reply You start off while I get
my breath

They were suddenly half drowned with a shower of spray Sir Henry held
Lessingham in a grip of iron or he would have been swept overboard

Get one arm through the chains man he shouted My God he added
peering through the gloom Lessingham

Well dont stop to worry about that was the fierce reply Lets get
on with our job

Sir Henry threw off his oilskins and his underneath coat

Follow me when they wave the lantern twice he directed If we either
of us get the knockwell thanks

Lessingham felt the grip of Sir Henrys hand as he passed him and went
overboard into the darkness Then with one arm through the chains
he drew towards him by means of his heel the coat which Sir Henry had
thrown upon the deck Gradually it came within reach of his disengaged
hand He seized it shook it out and dived eagerly into the breast
pocket There were several small articles which he threw ruthlessly
away and then a square packet wrapped in oilcloth which bent to his
fingers Another breaking wave threw him on his back One arm was still
through the chain the other gripped what some illuminating instinct
had already convinced him was the chart As soon as he had recovered
his breath a grim effort of humour parted his lips He lay there for a
moment and laughed till the spray this time with a rush of green water
underneath very nearly swept him from his place

They were waving a lantern on the beach when he struggled again to his
feet

He slipped the little packet down his clothes next to his skin and
groped about to find the end of the line which Sir Henry and he had
fastened to a staple below the chains Then he drew a long breath
gripped the rope and shouted A second or two later he was back in the
cauldron

As they pulled him on to the beach he had but one idea Whatever
happened he must not lose consciousness The packet was still there
against the calf of his leg It must be his own hands which removed his
clothes It seemed to him that those few bronzed faces those half a
dozen rude lanterns had become magnified and multiplied a hundredfold
It was an army of bluejerseyed fishermen which patted him on the back
and welcomed him lanterns like the stars flashing everywhere around
He set his teeth and fought against the buzzing in his ears He tried to
speak and his voice sounded like a weak far away whisper

I am all right he kept on saying

Then he felt himself leaning on two brawny arms His feet followed the
mesmeric influence of their movement Was he going into the clouds he
wondered They stopped to open a gate the gate leading to the gardens
of Mainsail Haul How did he get there He had no idea More movements
of his feet and then unexpected warmth He looked around him There
were voices He listened The one voice The one face bending over his
her eyes wet with tears her whispers an incoherent stream of broken
words Then the warmth seemed to come back to his veins He sat up and
found himself on the couch in the library the rain dripping from him in
little pools and he knew that he had succeeded He had not fainted

I am all right he repeated What a mess I am making

The voices around him were still a little tangled but the hand which
held a steaming tumbler to his lips was Philippas

Drink it all she begged

He felt the tears come into his eyes felt the warm blood streaming
through his body felt a little wet patch at the back of the calf of his
leg and the hand which set down the empty tumbler was almost steady

Theres a hot bath ready Philippa told him some dry clothes and a
bedroom with a fire in Do let Mills show you the way

He rose at once prepared to follow her His feet were not quite so
steady as he would have wished but he made a very presentable show
Mills with a little apology held out his arm Philippa walked by his
other side

As soon as you have finished your bath and got into some dry clothes
Philippa whispered please ring or send Mills to let us know

He was even able to smile at her

I am quite all right he assured her once more



CHAPTER XXV


Philippa unusually early on the following morning glanced at the empty
breakfast table with a little air of disappointment and rang the bell

Mills she enquired is no one down

Sir Henry is I believe on the beach your ladyship the man
answered and Miss Helen and Miss Nora are with him

And Mr Lessingham

Mr Lessingham your ladyship Mills continued looking carefully
behind him as though to be sure that the door was closed has
disappeared

Disappeared Philippa repeated What do you mean Mills

I left Mr Lessingham last night your ladyship Mills explained
in a suit of the masters clothes and apparently preparing for bedI
should say this morning as it was probably about two oclock I called
him at half past eight as desired and found the room empty The bed
had not been slept in

Was there no note or message Philippa asked incredulously

Nothing your ladyship One of the maid servants believes that she
heard the front door open at five oclock this morning

Ring up the hotel Philippa instructed and see if he is there

Mills departed to execute his commission Philippa stood looking out
of the window across the lawn and shrubbery and down on to the beach
There was still a heavy sea but it was merely the swell from the day
before The wind had dropped and the sun was shining brilliantly
Sir Henry Helen and Nora were strolling about the beach as though
searching for something About fifty yards out the wrecked trawler
was lying completely on its side with the end of one funnel visible
Scattered groups of the villagers were examining it from the sands In
due course Mills returned

The hotel people know nothing of Mr Lessingham your ladyship beyond
the fact that he did not return last night They received a message
from Hills Garage however about half an hour ago to say that their
mechanic had driven Mr Lessingham early this morning to Norwich where
he had caught the mail train to London The boy was to say that Mr
Lessingham would be back in a day or so

Philippa pushed open the windows and made her way down towards the
beach She leaned over the rail of the promenade and waved her hand to
the others who clambered up the shingle to meet her

Scarcely seen you yet my dear have I Sir Henry observed

He stooped and kissed her forehead a salute which she suffered without
response Helen pointed to the wreck

It doesnt seem possible does it she said that mens lives should
have been lost in that little space Two men were drowned they say
through the breaking of the rope They recovered the bodies this
morning

Everything else seems to have been washed on shore except my coat Sir
Henry grumbled I was down here at daylight looking for it

Your coat Philippa repeated scornfully Fancy thinking of that when
you only just escaped with your life

But to tell you the truth my dear Sir Henry explained my
pocketbook and papers of some value were in the pocket of that coat I
cant think how I came to forget them I think it was the surprise
of seeing that fellow Lessingham crawl on to the wreck looking like a
drowned rat Jove what a pluck he must have


The fishermen can talk of nothing else Nora put in excitedly Mummy
it was simply splendid Helen and I had gone up with two of the rescued
men but I got back just in time to see them fasten the rope round his
waist and watch him plunge in

How is he this morning Helen asked

Gone Philippa replied

They all looked at her in surprise

Gone Sir Henry repeated What back to the hotel do you mean

His bed has not been slept in Philippa told them He must have
slipped away early this morning gone to Hills Garage hired a car and
motored to Norwich From there he went on to London He has sent word
that he will be back in a few days

I hope to God he wont Sir Henry muttered

Philippa swung round upon him

What do you mean by that she demanded Dont you want to thank him
for saving your life

My dear I certainly do Sir Henry replied but just nowwell I am
a little taken aback Gone to London eh Tore away without warning
in the middle of the night to London And coming back toothats the
strange part of it

One would think from Sir Henrys expression that he was finding
food for much satisfaction in this recital of Lessinghams sudden
disappearance

He is a wonderful fellow this Lessingham he added thoughtfully He
must haveyes by God he must haveIn that storm too

If you could speak coherently Henry Philippa observed I should
like to say that I am exceedingly anxious to know why Mr Lessingham has
deserted us so precipitately

Sir Henry would have taken his wifes arm but she avoided him He
shrugged his shoulders and plodded up the steep path by her side

The whole question of Lessingham is rather a problem he said Of
course you and Helen have seen very much more of him than I have Isnt
it true that people have begun to make curious remarks about him

How did you know that Henry Philippa demanded

Well one hears things he replied I should gather from what I
heard that his position here had become a little precarious Hence his
sudden disappearance

But he is coming back again Philippa reminded her husband

Perhaps

Philippa signified her desire that her husband should remain a little
behind with her They walked side by side up the gravel path Philippa
kept her hands clasped behind her

To leave the subject of Mr Lessingham for a time she began I feel
very reluctant to ask for explanations of anything you do but I must
confess to a certain curiosity as to why I should find you lunching at
the Canton with two very beautiful ladies a few days ago when you left
here with Jimmy Dumble to fish for whiting and also why you return here
on a trawler which belongs to another part of the coast

Sir Henry made a grimace

I was beginning to wonder whether curiosity was dead he observed
goodhumouredly If you wouldnt mind giving me anotherwell to be
on the safe side let us say eight daysI think I shall be able to offer
you an explanation which you will consider satisfactory

Thank you Philippa rejoined with cold surprise I see no reason why
you should not answer such simple questions at once

Sir Henry sighed deprecatingly and made another vain attempt to take
his wifes arm

Philippa be a little brick he begged I know I seem to have been
playing the part of a fool just lately but there has been a sort of
reason for it

What reason could there possibly be she demanded which you could
not confide in me

He was silent for a moment When he spoke again there was a new
earnestness in his tone

Philippa he said I have been working for some time at a little
scheme which isnt ripe to talk about yet not even to you but which
may lead to something which I hope will alter your opinion You couldnt
see your way clear to trust me a little longer could you he begged
with rather a plaintive gleam in his blue eyes It would make it so
much easier for me to say no more but just have you sit tight

I wonder she answered coldly if you realise how much I have
suffered sitting tight as you call it and waiting for you to do
something

My fishing excursions he went on desperately have not been
altogether a matter of sport

I know that quite well she replied You have been making that chart
you promised your miserable fishermen None of those things interest me
Henry I fearI am very much inclined to say that none of your doings
interest me Least of all she went on her voice quivering with
passion do I appreciate in the least these mysterious appeals for my
patience I have some common sense Henry

Youre a suspicious little beast he told her

Suspicious she scoffed What a word to use from a man who goes
off fishing for whiting and is lunching at the Carlton some days
afterwards with two ladies of extraordinary attractions

That was a trifle awkward Sir Henry admitted with a little burst of
candour but it goes in with the rest Philippa

Then it can stay with the rest she retorted exactly where I have
placed it in my mind Please understand me Your conduct for the last
twelve months absolves me from any tie there may be between us If this
explanation that you promise comesin time and I feel like it very
well Until it does I am perfectly free and you as my husband are
nonexistent That is my reply Henry to your request for further
indulgence

Rather a foolish one my dear he answered patting her shoulder but
then you are rather a child arent you

She swung away from him angrily

Dont touch me she exclaimed I mean every word of what I have said
As for my being a childwell you may be sorry some day that you have
persisted in treating me like one

Sir Henry paused for a moment watching her disappearing figure There
was an unusual shade of trouble in his face His love for and confidence
in his wife had been so absolute that even her threats had seemed to him
like little morsels of wounded vanity thrown to him out of the froth
of her temper Yet at that moment a darker thought crossed his mind
Lessingham he realised was not a rival after all to be despised He
was a man of courage and tact even though Sir Henry in his own mind
had labelled him as a fool If indeed he were coming back to Dreymarsh
what could it be for How much had Philippa known about him He stood
there for a few moments in indecision A great impulse had come to him
to break his pledge to tell her the truth Then he made his disturbed
way into the breakfast room

Wheres your mother Nora he asked as Helen took Philippas place at
the head of the table

She wants some coffee and toast sent up to her room Nora explained
The wind made her giddy

Sir Henry breakfasted in silence rang the bell and ordered his car

You going away again Daddy Nora asked

I am going to London this morning he replied a little absently

To London Helen repeated Does Philippa know

I havent told her yet

Helen turned towards Nora

I wish youd run up and see if your mother wants any more coffee
theres a dear she suggested

Nora acquiesced at once As soon as she had left the room Helen leaned
over and laid her hand upon Sir Henrys arm

Dont go to London Henry she begged

But my dear Helen I must he replied a little curtly

I wouldnt if I were you she persisted You know youve tried
Philippa very high lately and she is in an extremely emotional state
She is all worked up about last night and I wouldnt leave her alone if
I were you

Sir Henrys blue eyes seemed suddenly like points of steel as he leaned
towards her

You think that she is in love with that fellow Lessingham he asked
bluntly

No I dont Helen replied but I think she is more furious with you
than you believe For months you have actedwell how shall I say

Oh like a coward if you like or a fool Go on

She has asked for explanations to which she is perfectly entitled
Helen continued and you have given her none You have treated her like
something between a doll and a child Philippa is as good and sweet as
any woman who ever lived but hasnt it ever occurred to you that women
are rather mysterious beings They may sometimes do out of a furious
sense of being wrongly treated out of a sort of aggravated pique what
they would never do for any other reason If you must go come back
tonight Henry Come back and if you are obstinate and wont tell
Philippa all that she has a right to know tell her about that luncheon
in town

Sir Henry frowned

Its all very well you know Helen he said but a woman ought to
trust her husband

I am your friend remember Helen replied and upon my word I
couldnt trust and believe even in Dick if he behaved as you have done
for the last twelve months

Sir Henry made a grimace

Well that settles it I suppose then he observed Ill have one
more try and see what I can do with Philippa Perhaps a hint of whats
going on may satisfy her

He climbed the stairs meeting Nora on her way down and knocked at his
wifes door There was no reply He tried the handle and found the door
locked

Are you there Philippa he asked

Yes she replied coldly

I am going to London this morning Can I have a few words with you
first

No

Sir Henry was a little taken aback

Dont be silly Philippa he persisted I may be away for four or
five days

There was no answer Sir Henry suddenly remembered another entrance
from a newly added bathroom He availed himself of it and found Philippa
seated in an easychair calmly progressing with her breakfast She
raised her eyebrows at his entrance

These are my apartments she reminded him

Dont be a little fool he exclaimed impatiently

Philippa deliberately buttered herself a piece of toast picked up her
book and became at once immersed in it

You dont wish to talk to me then he demanded

I do not she agreed You have had all the opportunities which any
man should need of explaining certain matters to me My curiosity
in them has ended also my interestin you You say you are going to
London Very well Pray do not hurry home on my account

Sir Henry as he turned to leave the room made the common mistake of a
man arguing with a womanhe attempted to have the last word

Perhaps I am better out of the way eh

Perhaps so Philippa assented sweetly



CHAPTER XXVI


Philippa late that afternoon found what she soughtsolitude She had
walked along the sands until Dreymarsh lay out of sight on the other
side of a spur of the cliffs Before her stretched a long and level
plain a fringe of sand and a belt of shingly beach There was not a
sign of any human being in sight and of buildings only a quaint tower
on the far horizon

She found a dry place on the pebbles removed her hat and sat down her
hands clasped around her knees her eyes turned seaward She had
come out here to think but it was odd how fugitive and transient her
thoughts became Her husband was always there in the background but
in those moments it was Lessingham who was the predominant figure She
remembered his earnestness his tender solicitude for her the courage
which when necessity demanded had flamed up in him a born and natural
quality She remembered the agony of those few minutes on the preceding
day when nothing but what still seemed a miracle had saved him At one
moment she felt herself inclined to pray that he might never come back
At another her heart ached to see him once more She knew so well
that if he came it would be for her sake that he would come to ask her
finally the question with which she had fenced She knew too that his
coming would be the moment of her life She was so much of a woman and
the passionate craving of her sex to give love for love was there in her
heart almost omnipotent And in the background there was that bitter
desire to bring suffering upon the man who had treated her like a child
who had placed her in a false position with all other women who had
dawdled and idled away his days heedless of his duty heedless of every
serious obligation When she tried to reason her way seemed so clear
and yet behind it all there was that cold impulse of almost Victorian
prudishness the inheritance of a long line of virtuous women a
prudishness which she had once when she had believed that it was part
of her second nature scoffed at as being the outcome of one of the
finer forms of selfishness

She told herself that she had come there to decide and decision came no
nearer to her A late afternoon star shone weakly in the sky A faint
vaporous mist obscured the horizon and floated in tangled wreaths upon
the face of the sea Only that line of sand seemed still clearcut and
distinct and as she glanced along it her eyes were held by something
approaching something which seemed at first nothing but a black moving
speck then gradually resolved itself into the semblance of a man on
horseback galloping furiously She watched him as he drew nearer and
nearer the sand flying from his horses hoofs his figure motionless
his eyes apparently fixed upon some distant spot It was not until he
had come within fifty yards of her that she recognised him His horse
shied at the sight of her and was suddenly swung round with a powerful
wrist Little specks of sand churned up in the momentary stampede
of hoofs fell upon her skirt For the rest she watched the struggle
composedly a struggle which was over almost as soon as it was begun
Captain Griffiths leaned down from his trembling but subdued horse

Lady Cranston he exclaimed in astonishment

Thats me she replied smiling up at him Have you been riding off
your bad temper

He glanced down at his horses quivering sides Back as far as one could
see there was that regular line of hoof marks

Am I badtempered he asked

Well she observed I dont know you well enough to answer that
question I was simply thinking of yesterday evening

He slipped from his horse and stood before her His long severe face
had seldom seemed more malevolent

I had enough to make me badtempered he declared I had tracked
down a German spy step by step until I had him there waiting for
arrestexpecting it evenand then I got that wicked message

What was that wicked message after all she enquired

That doesnt matter he answered It was from a quarter where they
ought to know better and it ordered me to make no arrest I have sent
to the War Office today a full report and I am praying that they may
change their minds

Philippa sighed

If you hadnt received that telegram last night she observed it
seems to me that I should have been a widow today

He frowned and struck his boot heavily with his riding whip

Yes I heard of that he admitted I dare say if he hadnt gone
though some one else would

Would you have gone if you had been there she asked

If you had told me to he replied looking at her steadfastly

Philippa felt a little shiver There was something ominous in the
intensity of his gaze and the meaning which he had contrived to impart
to his tone She rose to her feet

Well she said dont let me keep you here I am getting cold

He passed his arm through the bridle of his horse I will walk with
you if I may he proposed She made no reply and they set their faces
homewards

I hear Lessingham has left the place he remarked a little abruptly

Oh I expect hell come back Philippa replied

How long is it Lady Cranston since you took to consorting with German
spies he asked

Dont be foolishor impertinent she enjoined You are making a
ridiculous mistake about Mr Lessingham

He laughed unpleasantly

No need for us to fence he said You and I know who he is What I
do want to know what I have been wondering all the way from the point
therefour miles of hard galloping and one questionwhy are you his
friend What is he to you

Really Captain Griffiths she protested looking up at him of what
possible interest can that be to you

Well it is anyhow he answered gruffly Anything that concerns you
is of interest to me

Philippa realised at that moment perhaps for the first time what it
all meant She realised the significance of those apparently purposeless
afternoon calls when through sheer boredom she had had to send for
Helen to help her out the significance of those long silences the
melancholy eyes which seemed to follow her movements She felt an
unaccountable desire to laugh and then at the first twitchings of her
lips she restrained herself She knew that tragedy was stalking by her
side

I think Captain Griffiths she said gravely that you are talking
nonsense and you are not a very good hand at it Wont you please ride
on

He made no movement to mount his horse He plodded along the soft sand
by her sidea queer elongated figure his gloomy eyes fixed upon the
ground

Until this fellow Lessingham came you were never so hard he
persisted

She looked at him with genuine curiosity

I was never so hard she repeated Do you imagine that I have ever
for a single moment considered my demeanour towards youyou of all
persons in the world I simply dont remember when you have been there
and when you havent I dont remember the humours in which I have been
when we have conversed All that you have said seems to me to be the
most arrant nonsense

He swung himself into the saddle and gathered up the reins

Thank you he said bitterly I understand Only let me tell you
this he went on his whip poised in his hand You may have powerful
friends who saved your

He hesitated so long that she glanced up at him and read all that he had
wished to say in his face

My what she asked

His courage failed him

Mr Lessingham he proceeded from arrest But if he shows his face
here again in Dreymarsh I shant stop to arrest him I shall shoot him
on sight and chance the consequences

Theyll hang you she declared savagely

He laughed at her

Hang me for shooting a man whom I can prove to be a German spy They
wont dare They wont even dare to place me under arrest for an hour
Why when the truth becomes known he went on his voice gaining
courage as the justice of his case impressed itself upon him what do
you suppose is going to happen to two women who took this fellow in and
befriended him introduced him under a false name to their friends gave
him the run of their housethis man whom they knew all the time was a
German You Lady Cranston chafing and scolding your husband by night
and by day because he isnt where you think he ought to be you so
patriotic that you cannot bear the sight of him out of uniform youthe
hostess the befriender the God knows what of Bertram Maderstrom It
will be a pretty tale when its all told

I really think Philippa asserted calmly that you are the most
utterly impossible and obnoxious creature I have ever met

His face was dangerous for a moment They had not yet reached the
promontory which sheltered them from Dreymarsh

Perhaps he muttered leaning malignly towards her I could make
myself even more obnoxious

Quite possibly she replied only I want to tell you this If you
come a single inch nearer to me one of them shall shoot you

Your friend or your husband eh he scoffed

She waved him on

I think she told him that either of them would be quite capable of
ridding the world of a coward like you

A coward he repeated

Precisely Isnt it a cowards part to terrorise a woman

I dont want to terrorise you he said sulkily

Well you must admit that you havent shown any particular desire to
make yourself agreeable she pointed out

He turned suddenly upon her

I am a fool I know he declared bitterly Im an awkward nervous
miserable fool my own worst enemy as they say of me in the Mess
turning the people against me I want to have like me stumbling into
every blunder a fool can Im the sort of man women make sport of and
youve done it for them cruelly perfectly

Captain Griffiths she protested When have I ever been anything but
kind and courteous to you

It isnt your kindness I want nor your courtesy Theres a curse upon
my tongue he went on desperately Im not like other men I dont
know how to say what I feel I cant put it into words Every one
misunderstands me You too Here I rode up to you this afternoon and
my heart was beating for joy and in five minutes I had made an enemy of
you Damn that fellow Lessingham It is all his fault

Without the slightest warning he brought down his hunting crop upon his
horses flanks The mare gave one great plunge and he was off riding
at a furious gallop Philippa watched him with immense relief In the
far distance she could see two little specks growing larger and larger
She hurried on towards them

Whatever did you do to Captain Griffiths Mummy Nora demanded Why
he passed us without looking down galloping like a madman and his face
lookedwell what did it look like Helen

Helen was gazing uneasily along the sands

Like a man riding for his enemy she declared



CHAPTER XXVII


Philippa and Helen looked at one another a little dolefully across the
luncheon table

I suppose one misses the child Helen said

I feel too depressed for words Philippa admitted

A few days ago Helen reminded her companion we were getting all the
excitement that was good for any one

And a little more Philippa agreed I dont know why things seem
so flat now We really ought to be glad that nothing terrible has
happened

What with Henry and Mr Lessingham both away Helen continued and
Captain Griffiths not coming near the place we really have reverted to
the normal havent we I wonderif Mr Lessingham has gone back

I do not think so Philippa murmured

Helen frowned slightly

Personally she said with some emphasis I hope that he has

If we are considering the personal point of view only Philippa
retorted I hope that he has not

Helen looked her disapproval

I should have thought that you had had enough playing with fire she
observed

One never has until one has burned ones fingers Philippa sighed
I know perfectly well what is the matter with you she continued
severely You are fretting because curried chicken is Dicks favourite
dish

I am not such a baby Helen protested All the same it does make one
think I wonder

I know exactly what you were going to say Philippa interrupted You
were going to say that you wondered whether Mr Lessingham would keep
his promise

Whether he would be able to Helen corrected It does seem so
impossible doesnt it

So does Mr Lessingham himself Philippa reminded her It isnt
exactly a usual thing is it to have a perfectly charming and wellbred
young man step out of a Zeppelin into your drawingroom

You really believe then Helen asked eagerly that he will be able
to keep his promise

Philippa nodded confidently

Do you know she said I believe that Mr Lessingham by some means
or another would keep any promise he ever made I am expecting to see
Dick at any moment now so you can get on with your lunch dear and not
sit looking at the curry with tears in your eyes

It isnt the curry so much as the chutney Helen protested faintly
He never would touch any other sort

Well I shouldnt be surprised if he were here to finish the bottle
Philippa declared I have a feeling this morning that something is
going to happen

How long has Nora gone away for Helen enquired after a moments
pause

A fortnight or three weeks Philippa answered Her grandmother wired
that she would be glad to have her until Christmas

Just why Helen asked seriously have you sent her away

Philippa toyed with her curry and glanced around as though she
regretted Mills absence from the room

I thought it best she said quietly You see I am not quite sure
what the immediate future of this menage is going to be

Helen leaned across the table and laid her hand upon her friends

Dear she sighed it worries me so to hear you talk like that

Why

Because you know perfectly well although you profess to ignore it
that at the bottom of your heart there is no one else but Henry It
isnt fair you know

To whom isnt it fair Philippa demanded

To Mr Lessingham

Philippa was thoughtful for a few moments

Perhaps she admitted that is a point of view which I have not
sufficiently considered

Helen pressed home her advantage

I dont think you realise Philippa she said how madly in love with
you the man is In a perfectly ingenuous way too No one could help
seeing it

Then where does the unfairness come in Philippa asked It is within
my power to give him all that he wants

But you wouldnt do it Philippa You know that you wouldnt Helen
objected You may play with the idea in your mind but thats just as
far as youd ever get


Philippa looked her friend steadily in the face I disagree with you
Helen she said Helen set down the glass which she had been in the act
of raising to her lips It was her first really serious intimation of
the tragedy which hovered over her future sisterinlaws life Somehow
or other Philippa had seemed even to her so far removed from that
strenuous world of overdrugged overexcited feminine decadence to
whom the changing of a husband or a lover is merely an incident in
the days excitements Philippa with her frail and almost flowerlike
beauty her love of the wholesome ways of life and her strong
affections represented other things Now for the first time Helen was
really afraid afraid for her friend

But you couldnt everyou wouldnt leave Henry

Philippa seemed to find nothing monstrous in the idea

That is just what I am seriously thinking of doing she confided

Helen affected to laugh but her mirth was obviously forced Their
conversation ceased perforce with the return of Mills into the room

Then the wonderful thing happened The windows of the dining room faced
the drive to the house and both women could clearly see a motor car turn
in at the gate and stop at the front door It was obviously a hired
car as the driver was not in livery but the tall mulledup figure
in unfamiliar clothes who occupied the front seat was for the moment a
mystery to them Only Helen seemed to have some wonderful premonition of
the truth a premonition which she was afraid to admit even to herself
Her hand began to shake Philippa looked at her in amazement

You look as though you had seen a ghost Helen she exclaimed Who on
earth can it be coming at this time of the day

Helen was speechless and Philippa divined at once the cause of her
agitation She sprang to her feet

Helen you dont imagine she gasped Listen

There was a voice in the haila familiar voice though strained a
little and hoarse Mills decorous greetings agitated but fervent And
thenMajor Richard Felstead

Dick Helen screamed as she threw herself into his arms Oh Dick
Dick

It was an incoherent breathless moment Somehow or other Philippa
found herself sharing her brothers embrace Then the fire of questions
and answers was presently interrupted by Mills triumphantly bearing in
a fresh dish of curry

What will the Major take to drink your ladyship he asked

Felstead laughed a little chokingly

Upon my word theres something wonderfully sound about Mills he
said Its a ghoulish thing to ask for in the middle of the day isnt
it Philippa but can I have some champagne

You can have the whole cellarful Philippa assured him joyously Be
sure you bring the best Mills

The Perrier Jonet 1904 your ladyship was the murmured reply

Mills disappearance was very brief and in a very few moments they
found themselves seated once more at the table They sat one on
either side of him watching his glass and his plate By degrees their
questions and his answers became more intelligible

When did you get here they wanted to know

I arrived in Harwich about daylight this morning he told them came
across from Holland I hired a car and drove straight here

When did you know you were coming home Helen asked

Only two days ago he replied I never was so surprised in my life
Even now I cant realise my good luck I cant see what Ive done The
last two months in fact seem to me to have been a dream Jove he
went on as he drank his wine I never thought I should be such a pig
as to care so much for eating and drinking

And think what weeks of it you have before you Helen explained
clapping her hands Philippa and I will have a new interest in lifeto
make you fat

He laughed

It wont be very difficult he promised them I had several months of
semistarvation before the miracle happened It was all just the chance
of having had a pal up at Magdalen whos been serving in the German
ArmyBertram Maderstrom was his name You remember him Philippa He
was a Swede in those days

What a dear he must have been to have remembered and to have been so
faithful Philippa observed looking away for a moment

Hes a real good sort Felstead declared enthusiastically although
Heaven knows why hes turned German He worked like a slave for me I
dare say he didnt find it so difficult to get me better quarters and a
servant and decent food but when they told me that I was freewell
it nearly knocked me silly

The dear fellow Philippa murmured pensively

Do you remember him either of you Felstead continued Rather
goodlooking he was and a little shy but quite a sportsman

Iseem to remember Philippa admitted

The name sounds familiar Helen echoed Do have some more chutney
Dick

Thanks What a pig I am making of myself he observed cheerfully
You girls will think I cant talk about any one but Maderstrom but the
whole business beats me so completely Of course we were great pals in
a way but I never thought that I was the apple of his eye or anything
of that sort How he got the influence too I cant imagine And oh
I knew there was something else I was going to ask you girls
Felstead went on Have you ever had a letter or rather a letter each
uncensored Just a line or two I think I mentioned Maderstrom which I
should not have been allowed to do in the ordinary prison letters

Felstead was helping himself to cheese and he saw nothing of the quick
glance which passed between the two women

Yes we had them Dick Philippa told him It was one afternoonit
doesnt seem so very long ago And oh how thankful we were

Felstead nodded

He got them across all right then Tell me did they come through
Holland What was the postmark

The postmark Philippa repeated a little doubtfully You heard what
Dick asked Helen The postmark

I dont think there was one Helen replied glancing anxiously at
Philippa

Felstead set down his glass

No postmark You mean no foreign postmark I suppose They were posted
in England eh

Philippa shook her head

They came to us Dick she said by hand

Felstead was without a doubt astonished He turned round in his chair
towards Philippa

By hand he repeated Do you mean to say that they were actually
brought here by hand

Perhaps something in his manner warned them Philippa laughed as she
bent over his chair

We will tell you how they came presently she declared but
not until you have finished your lunch drunk the last drop of that
champagne and had at least two glasses of the port that Mills has been
decanting so carefully After that we will see Just now I have only one
feeling and I know that Helen has it too Nothing else matters except
that we have you home again

Felstead patted his sister on the cheek drew her face down to his and
kissed her

Its so wonderful to be at home he exclaimed apologetically But I
must warn you that I am the rabidest person alive I went out to the
war with a certain amount of respect for the Germans I have come back
loathing them like vermin I spentbut I wont go on

Mills made his appearance with the decanter of port

I beg your ladyships pardon he said as he filled Felsteads glass
but Mr Lessingham has arrived and is in the library waiting to see
you



CHAPTER XXVIII


To Major Richard Felstead Mills announcement was without significance
For the first time he became conscious however of something which
seemed almost like a secret understanding between his sister and his
fiancee

Tell Mr Lessingham I shall be with him in a minute or two if he will
kindly wait Philippa instructed

Who is Mr Lessingham Richard enquired as soon as the door had
closed behind Mills Seems a queer time to call

Helen glanced at Philippa whose lips framed a decided negative

Mr Lessingham is a gentleman staying in the neighbourhood the
latter replied You will probably make his acquaintance before long
Incidentally he saved Henrys life the other night

Sounds exciting Richard observed What form of destruction was Henry
courting

There was a trawler shipwrecked in the storm Philippa explained You
can see it from all the front windows Henry was on board returning
from one of his fishing excursions They were trying to find Dumbles
anchorage and were driven in on to that low ridge of rock A rope broke
or something they had no more rockets and Mr Lessingham swam out with
the line

Sounds like a plucky chap Richard admitted

Philippa rose to her feet regretfully

I expect he has come to wish us goodby she said Ill leave you
with Helen Dick Dont let her overfeed you And you know where the
cigars are Helen Take Dick into the gun room afterwards Youll have
it all to yourselves and there is a fire there

Philippa entered the library in a state of agitation for which she was
glad to have some reasonable excuse She held out both her hands to
Lessingham

Dick is backjust arrived she exclaimed I cant tell you how happy
we are and how grateful

Lessingham raised her fingers to his lips

I am glad he said simply Do you mean that he is in the house here
now

He is in the dining room with Helen

Lessingham for a moment was thoughtful

Dont you think he suggested that it would be better to keep us
apart

I was wondering she confessed

Have you told him about my bringing the letters

She shook her head

We nearly did Then I stoppedI wasnt sure

You were wise he said

Are you wise she asked him quickly

In coming back here

She nodded

Captain Griffiths knows everything she reminded him He is simply
furious because your arrest was interfered with I really believe that
he is dangerous

Lessingham was unmoved

I had to come back he said simply

Why did you go away so suddenly

Well I had to do that too he replied only the governing causes
were very different We will speak if you do not mind only of the
cause which has brought me back That I believe you know already

Philippa was curiously afraid She looked towards the door as though
with some vague hope of escape She realised that the necessity for
decision had arrived

Philippa he went on do you see what this is

He handed her two folded slips of paper She started At the top of one
she recognised a small photograph of herself

What are they she asked What does it mean

They are passports for America he told her

Forfor me she faltered

For you and me

They slipped from her fingers He picked them up from the carpet Her
face was hidden for a moment in her hands

I know so well how you are feeling he said humbly I know how
terrible a shock this must seem to you when it comes so near You are
so different from the other women who might do this thing It is so much
harder for you than for them

She lifted her head There was still something of the look of a scared
child in her face

Dont imagine me better than I am she begged I am not really
different from any other woman only it is the first time this sort of
thing has ever come into my life

I know You see he went on a little wistfully you have not taken
me as yet very far into your confidence Philippa You know that I
love you as a man loves only once It sounds like an empty phrase to say
it but if you will give me your life to take care of I shall only have
one thoughtto make you happy Could I succeed That is what you have
to ask yourself You are not happy now Do you think that if you stay
on here the future is likely to be any better for you

She shook her head drearily

I believe she confessed that I have reached the very limit of my
endurance

He came a little nearer His hands rested upon her shoulders very
lightly yet they seemed like some enveloping chain More than ever in
those few moments she realised the spiritual qualities of his face
His eyes were aglow His voice a little broken with emotion was
wonderfully tender He looked at her as though she were some precious
and sacred thing

I am rich he said and there are few parts of the world where we
could not live We could find our way to the islands like your great
writer Stevenson in whom you delight so much islands full of colour
and wonderful birds and strange blue skies islands where the peace of
the tropics dulls memory and time beats only in the heart The world is
a great place Philippa and there are corners where the sordid crime of
this ghastly butchery has scarcely been heard of where the horror and
the taint of it are as though they never existed where the sun and
moon are still unashamed and the grey monsters ride nowhere upon the
sapphire seas

It sounds like a fairy tale she murmured with a half pathetic smile

Love always fashions life like a fairy tale he replied

She stood perfectly still

You must have my answer now at this moment she asked at last

There are yet some hours he told her I have a very powerful
automobile here and tonight there is a full moon If we leave here at
ten oclock we can catch the steamer tomorrow afternoon Everything
has been made very easy for me And fortune too is with usyour
vindictive commandant Captain Griffiths is in London You see
you have the whole afternoon for thought I want you only for your
happiness At ten oclock I shall come here If you are coming with me
you must be ready then You understand

I understand she assented under her breath And now she went
on raising her eyes somehow I think that you are right It would be
better for you and Dick not to meet

I am sure of it he agreed I shall come for my answer at ten
oclock I wonder

He stood looking at her his eyes hungry to find some sign in her face
There was so much kindness there so much that might pass even
for affection and yet something which behind it all chilled his
confidence He left his sentence uncompleted and turned towards the
door Suddenly she called him back She held up her finger Her whole
expression had changed She was alarmed

Wait she begged I can hear Dicks voice Wait till he has crossed
the hail

They both stood for a moment quite silent Then they heard a little
protesting cry from Helen and a goodhumoured laugh from Richard The
door was thrown open

You dont mind our coming through to the gun room Phil her brother
asked Were notMy God

There was a queer silence broken by Helen who stood on the threshold
the picture of distress

I tried to get him to go the other way Philippa

Richard took a quick step forward His hands were outstretched

Bertram he exclaimed Is this a miracle You here with my sister

Lessingham held out his hand Suddenly Richard dropped his His
expression had become sterner

I dont understand he said simply Somebody please explain



CHAPTER XXIX


For a few brief seconds no one seemed inclined to take upon themselves
the onus of speech Richards amazement seemed to increase upon
reflection

Maderstrom he exclaimed Bertram What in the name of all thats
diabolical are you doing here

I am just a derelict Lessingham explained with a faint smile Glad
to see you Richard You are a day earlier than I expected

You knew that I was coming then Richard demanded

Naturally Lessingham replied I had the great pleasure of arranging
for your release

Look here Richard went on Im groping about a bit I dont
understand Forgive me if I run off the track Im not forgetting our
friendship Maderstrom or what I owe to you since you came and found me
at Wittenburg But for all that you have served in the German Army and
are an enemy and I want to know what you are doing here in England in
my brotherinlaws house

No particular harm Richard I promise you Lessingham replied mildly

You are here under a false name

Hamar Lessingham if you do not mind the other assented I prefer my
own name but I do not fancy that the use of it would ensure me a very
warm welcome over here just now Besides he added with a glance
at Philippa I have to consider the friends whose hospitality I have
enjoyed

In a shadowy sort of way the truth began to dawn upon Richard His tone
became grimmer and his manner more menacing

Maderstrom he said we met last under different circumstances I
will admit that I cut a poor figure but mine was at least an honourable
imprisonment I am not so sure that yours is an honourable freedom

Philippa laid her hand upon her brothers arm

Dick dear do remember that they were starving you to death she
begged

You would never have lived through it Helen echoed

You are talking to Mr Lessingham Philippa protested as though he
were an enemy instead of the best friend you ever had in your life

Richard waved them away

You must leave this to us he insisted Maderstrom and I will be
able to understand one another at any rate What are you doing in this
housein England What is your mission here

Whatever it may have been it is accomplished Lessingham said
gravely At the present moment my plans are to leave your country
tonight

Accomplished Richard repeated What the devil do you mean
Accomplished Are you playing the spy in this country

You would probably consider my mission espionage Lessingham admitted

And you have brought it to a successful conclusion

I have

Philippa threw her arms around her brothers neck Dick she pleaded
please listen Mr Lessingham has been here in this district ever
since he landed in England What possible harm could he do We havent
a single secret to be learned Everybody knows where our few guns are
Everybody knows where our soldiers are quartered We havent a harbour
or any secret fortifications We havent any shipping information which
it would be of the least use signalling anywhere Mr Lessingham has
spent his time amongst trifles here Take Helen away somewhere and
forget that you have seen him in the house Remember that he has saved
Henrys life as well as yours

I invite no consideration upon that account Lessingham declared All
that I did for you in Germany I did or should have attempted to do
for my old friend Your release was different I am forced to admit
that it was the price paid for my sojourn here I will only ask you to
remember that the bargain was made without your knowledge and that you
are in no way responsible for it

A price Richard pronounced fiercely which I refuse to pay

Lessingham shrugged his shoulders

The alternative he confessed is in your hands

Richard moved towards the telephone

I am sorry Maderstrom he said but my duty is clear Who is
Commandant here Philippa

Philippa stood between her brother and the telephone There was a queer
angry patch of colour in her cheeks Her eyes were on fire

Richard she exclaimed you shall not do this from my house I forbid
you

Do what

Give information Do you know what it would mean if they believed you

Death he answered Maderstrom knew the risk he ran when he came to
this country under a false name

Perfectly Lessingham admitted

But I wont have it Philippa protested He has become our friend
Day by day we have grown to like him better and better He has saved
your life Dick He has brought you back to us Think what it is that
you purpose

It is what every soldier has to face Richard declared

You men drive me crazy with your foolish ideas Philippa cried
desperately The war is in your brains I think You would carry it
from the battlefields into your daily life Because two great countries
are at war is everything to go bychivalryall the finer sweeter
feelings of life If you two met on the battlefield it would be
different Here in my drawingroom I will not have this black demon of
the war dragged in as an excuse for murder Take Dick away Helen she
begged Mr Lessingham is leaving tonight I will pledge my word that
until then he remains a harmless citizen

Women dont understand these things Philippa Richard began

Thank heavens we understand them better than you men Philippa
interrupted fiercely You have but one ideato strikethe narrow
idea of men that breeds warfare I tell you that if ever universal peace
comes if ever the nations are taught the horror of this lust for blood
this criminal outrage against civilisation it is the women who will
become the teachers because amongst your instincts the brutish ones of
force are the first to leap to the surface at the slightest provocation
We women see further we know more I swear to you Richard that if you
interfere I will never forgive you as long as I live

Richard stared at his sister in amazement There seemed to be some new
spirit born within her Throughout all their days he had never known her
so much in earnest so passionately insistent He looked from her to the
man whom she sought to protect and who answered unasked the thoughts
that were in his mind

Whatever harm I may have been able to do Lessingham announced is
finished I leave this place tonight probably for ever As for the
Commandant he went on with a faint smile he is already upon my
track There is nothing you can tell him about me which he does not
know It is just a matter of hours the toss of a coin whether I get
away or not

Theyve found you out then Richard exclaimed

Only a miracle saved me from arrest a week ago Lessingham
acknowledged Your Commandant here is at the present moment in London
for the sole purpose of denouncing me

And yet you remain here paying afternoon calls Richard observed
incredulously Im hanged if I can see through this

You see Lessingham explained gently I am a fatalist

It was Helen who finally led her lover from the room He looked back
from the door

Maderstrom he said you know quite well how personally I feel
towards you I am grateful for what you have done for me even though I
am beginning to understand your motives But as regards the other things
we are both soldiers I am going to talk to Helen for a time I want to
understand a little more than I do at present

Lessingham nodded

Let me help you he begged Here is the issue in plain words All
that I did for you at Wittenberg I should have done in any case for
the sake of our friendship Your freedom would probably never have been
granted to me but for my mission although even that I might have tried
to arrange I brought your letters here and I traded them with your
sister and Miss Fairclough for the shelter of their hospitality and
their guarantees Now you know just where friendship ended and the other
things began Do what you believe to be your duty

Richard followed Helen out closing the door after him Lessingham
looked down into Philippas face

You are more wonderful even than I thought he continued softly You
say so little and you live so near the truth It is those of us who feel
as you dowho understandto whom this war is so terrible

I want to ask you one question before I send you away she told him
This journey to America

It is a mission on behalf of Germany he explained but it is after
all an open one I have friendshighly placed friendsin my own
country who in their hearts feel as I do about the war It is through
them that I am able to turn my back upon Europe I have done my share
of fighting he went on sadly and the horror of it will never quite
leave me I think that no one has ever charged me with shirking my duty
and yet the sheer black ugliness of this ghastly struggle its criminal
inutility have got into my blood so that I think I would rather pass
out of the world in some simple way than find myself back again in that
debauch of blood Is this cowardice Philippa

She looked at him with shining eyes

There isnt any one in the world she said who could call you a
coward Whatever I may decide whatever I may feel towards you that at
least I know

He kissed her fingers

At ten oclock he began

But listen she interrupted Apart from anything which Dick might
do you are in terrible danger here all the more if you really have
accomplished something Why not go now at this moment Why wait These
few hours may make all the difference

He smiled

They may indeed make all the difference to my life he answered
That is for you

He followed Mills who had obeyed her summons out of the room Philippa
moved to the window and watched him until he had disappeared Then very
slowly she left the room walked up the stairs made her way to her own
little suite of apartments and locked the door



CHAPTER XXX


It was a happy if a trifle hysterical little dinner party that evening
at Mainsail Haul Philippa was at times unusually silent but Helen had
expanded in the joy of her great happiness Richard shaved and with
his hair cut attired once more in the garb of civilisation seemed
a different person Even in these few hours the lines about his mouth
seemed less pronounced They talked freely of Maderstrom

A regular Vanity Fair problem Richard declared balancing his wine
glass between his fingers a problem too which I cant say I have
solved altogether yet The only thing is that if he is really going
tonight I dont see why I shouldnt let the matter drift out of my
mind

It is so much better Helen agreed Try as hard as ever I can I
cannot picture his doing any harm to anybody And as for any information
he may have gained here well I think that we can safely let him take
it back to Germany

He was always Richard continued reminiscently a sort of cross
between a dreamer an idealist and a sportsman There was never
anything of the practical man of affairs about him He was scrupulously
honourable and almost a purist in his outlook upon life I have met
a great many Germans Richard went on and Ive killed a few thank
Godbut he is about as unlike the ordinary type as any one I ever met
The only pity is that he ever served his time with them

Philippa had been listening attentively She was more than ever silent
after her brothers little appreciation of his friend Richard glanced
at her goodhumouredly

You havent killed the fatted calf for me in the shape of clothes
Philippa he observed One would think that you were going on a
journey

She glanced down at her highnecked gown and avoided Helens anxious
eyes

I may go for a walk she said and leave you two young people to talk
secrets I am rather fond of the garden these moonlight nights

When is Henry coming back her brother enquired

Philippas manner was quiet but ominous

I have no idea she confessed He comes and goes as the whim seizes
him and I very seldom know where he is One week it is whiting and
another codling Lately he seems to have shown some partiality for
London life

Richards eyes were wide open now

You mean to say that he is still not doing anything

Nothing whatever

But what excuse does he giveor rather I should say reason Richard
persisted

He says that he is too old for a ship and he wont work in an office
Philippa replied That is what he says His point of view is so
impossible that I can not even discuss it with him

Its the rummest go I ever came across Richard remarked
reminiscently I should have said that old Henry would have been up and
at em at the Admiralty before the first gun was fired

On the contrary Philippa rejoined he took advantage of the war to
hire a Scotch moor at halfprice about a week after hostilities had
commenced

Its a rum go Richard repeated I cant fancy Henry as a skulker
Forgive me Philippa he added

You are entirely forgiven she assured him drily

He comes of such a fine fighting stock Richard mused I suppose his
health is all right

His health Philippa declared is marvellous I should think he is
one of the strongest men I know

Her brother patted her hand

Youve been making rather a trouble of it old girl he said
affectionately Its no good doing that you know You wait and let me
have a talk with Henry

I think she replied that nearly everything possible has already
been said to him

Perhaps youve put his back up a bit Richard suggested and he may
really be on the lookout for something all the time

It has been a long search Philippa retorted with quiet sarcasm Let
us talk about something else

They gossiped for a time over acquaintances and relations made their
plans for the weekRichard must report at the War Office at once

Philippa grew more and more silent as the meal drew to a close It was
at Helens initiative that they left Richard alone for a moment over
his port She kept her arm through her friends as they crossed the hall
into the drawingroom and closed the door behind them Philippa stood
upon the hearth rug Already her mouth had come together in a straight
line Her eyes met Helens defiantly

I know exactly what you are going to say Helen she began and I
warn you that it will be of no use

Helen drew up a small chair and seated herself before the fire

Are you going away with Mr Lessingham Philippa she asked

I am was the calm response I made up my mind this afternoon We are
leaving tonight

Helen stretched out one foot to the blaze

Motoring she enquired

Naturally Philippa replied You know there are no trains leaving
here tonight

Youll have a cold ride Helen remarked I should take your heavy fur
coat

Philippa stared at her companion

You dont seem much upset Helen

I think Helen declared looking up that nothing that has ever
happened to me in my life has made me more unhappy but I can see that
you have reasoned it all out and there is not a single argument I could
use which you havent already discounted It is your life Philippa not
mine

Since you are so philosophical Philippa observed let me ask
youshould you do what I am going to do if you were in my place

I should not was the firm reply

Philippa laughed heartily

Oh I know what you are going to say Helen continued quickly Youll
tell me wont you that I am not temperamental I think in your heart
you rather despise my absolute fidelity to Richard You would call it
cowlike or something of that sort There is a difference between us
Philippa and that is why I am afraid to argue with you

What should you do Philippa demanded if Richard failed you in some
great thing

I might suffer Helen confessed but my love would be there all the
same Perhaps for that reason I should suffer the more but I should
never be able to see with those who judged him hardly

You think then Philippa persisted that I ought still to remain
Henrys loving and affectionate wife ready to take my place amongst the
pastimes of his lifewhen he feels inclined for instance to wander
from his dark ladylove to something petite and of my complexion or
when he settles down at home for a few days after a fortnights sport on
the sea and expects me to tell him the war news

I dont think that I should do that Helen admitted quietly but I am
quite certain that I shouldnt run away with another man

Why not

Because I should be punishing myself too much

Philippas eyes suddenly flashed

Helen she said you are not such a fool as you try to make me think
Cant you see what is really at the back of it all in my mind Cant you
realise that whatever the punishment it may bring it will punish Henry
more

I see Helen observed You are running away with Mr Lessingham to
annoy Henry

Oh hell be more than annoyed Philippa laughed sardonically He has
terrible ideas about the sanctity of things that belong to him Hell be
remarkably sheepish for some time to come He may even feel a few little
stabs When I have time I am going to write him a letter which he can
keep for the rest of his life It wont please him

Where are youand Mr Lessingham going to live Helen enquired

In America to start with Ive always longed to go to the States

What shall you do Helen continued if you dont get out of the
country safely

Mr Lessingham seems quite sure that we shall Philippa replied and
he seems a person of many expedients Of course if we didnt I should
go back to Cheshire I should have gone back there anyway before now
if Mr Lessingham hadnt come

Well it all seems very simple Helen admitted I think Mr
Lessingham is a perfectly delightful person and I shouldnt wonder if
you didnt now and then almost imagine that you were happy

You seem to be taking my going very coolly Philippa remarked

I told you how I felt about it just now Helen reminded her Your
going is like a great black cloud that I have seen growing larger and
larger day by day I think that in his way Dick will suffer just as
much as Henry We shall all be utterly miserable

Why dont you try and persuade me not to go then Philippa demanded
You sit there talking about it as though I were going on an ordinary
countryhouse visit

Helen raised her head and Philippa saw that her eyes were filled with
tears

Philippa dear she said if I thought that all the tears that were
ever shed all the words that were ever dragged from ones heart could
have any real effect Id go on my knees to you now and implore you to
give up this idea But I thinkyou wont be angry with me dearI
think you would go just the same

You seem to think that I am obstinate Philippa complained

You see you are temperamental dear Helen reminded her You have a
complex nature I know very well that you need the daily love that Henry
doesnt seem to have been willing to give you lately and I couldnt
stop your turning towards the sun you know Onlyall the time theres
that terrible anxietyare you quite sure it is the sun

You believe in Mr Lessingham dont you Philippa asked

I do indeed Helen replied I am not quite sure though that I
believe in you

Philippa was a little startled

Well I never she exclaimed Exactly what do you mean by that
Helen

I am not quite sure Helen continued that when the moment has really
come and your head is upturned and your arms outstretched and your
feet have left this world in which you are now I am not quite sure that
you will find all that you seek

You think he doesnt love me

I am not convinced Helen replied calmly that you love him

Why you idiot Philippa declared feverishly of course I love him
I think he is one of the sweetest most lovable persons I ever knew
and as to his being a Swede I shouldnt care whether he were a Fiji
Islander or a Chinese

Helen nodded sympathetically

I agree with you she said but listen You know that I havent
uttered a single word to dissuade you Well then grant me just one
thing Before you start off this evening tell Mr Lessingham the truth
whatever it may be the truth which you havent told me It very likely
wont make any difference Two people as nice as you and he who are
going to join their lives generally do I believe find the things they
seek Still tell him

Philippa made no reply Richard opened the door and lingered upon the
threshold Helen rose to her feet

I am coming Dick she called out cheerfully Theres a gorgeous fire
in the gun room and two big easychairs and well have just the time I
have been looking forward to all day Youll tell me things wont you

She looked very sweet as she came towards him her eyes raised to him
her face full of the one happiness He passed his arm around her waist

Ill try dear he said You wont be lonely Philippa

Ill come and disturb you when I am she promised

The door closed She stood gazing down into the fire listening to their
footsteps as they crossed the hall



CHAPTER XXXI


Lessingham stood for a moment by the side of the car from which he had
just descended glanced at the huge tyres and the tins of petrol lashed
on behind

Nothing more you want chauffeur he asked

Nothing sir was the almost inaudible reply

You have the route map

Yes sir and enough petrol for three hundred miles

Lessingham turned away pushed open the gate and walked up the drive
of Mainsail Haul Decidedly it was the moment of his life He was
hardpressed as he knew by others besides Griffiths A few hours now
was all the start he could reasonably expect He was face to face with a
very real and serious danger which he could no longer ignore and from
which escape was all the time becoming more difficult And yet all
the emotionalism of this climax was centred elsewhere It was from
Philippas lips that he would hear his real sentence it was her answer
which would fill him once more with the lust for life or send him on in
his rush through the night for safety callous almost indifferent as to
its result

He walked up the drive curiously at his ease in a state of suspended
animation which knew no hope and feared no disappointment Just before
he reached the front door the postern gate in the wall on his lefthand
side opened and Philippa stood there muffled up in her fur coat
framed in the faint and shadowy moonlight against the background of
seabounded space He moved eagerly towards her

I heard the car she whispered Come and sit down for a moment It
isnt in the least cold and the moon is just coming up over the sea
I came out she went on as he walked obediently by her side because
the house somehow stifled me

She led him to a seat Below the long waves were breaking through upon
the rocks throwing little fountains of spray into the air The village
which lay at their feet was silent and lifelessthere was indeed a
curious absence of sound except when the incoming waves broke upon the
rocks and ground the pebbles together in their long backward swish
Very soon the sleeping country now wrapped in shadows would take form
and outline in the light of the rising moon hedges would divide the
square fields the black woods would take shape and the hills their
mystic solemnity But those few minutes were minutes of suspense
Lessingham was to some extent conscious of their queer allegorical
significance

I have come he reminded her quite steadily for my answer

She showed him the small bag by her side upon the seat and touched her
cloak She was indeed prepared for a journey

You see she told him here I am

His face was suddenly transformed She was almost afraid of the effect
of her words She found herself struggling in his arms

Not yet she begged Please remember where we are

He released her reluctantly A few yards away they could hear the soft
purring of the sixcylinder engine inexorable reminder of the passing
moments He caught her by the hand

Come he whispered passionately Every moment is precious

She hesitated no longer The open postern gate seemed to him suddenly to
lead down the great thoroughfare of a new and splendid life He was to
be one of those favoured few to whom was given the divine prize And
then he stopped short even while she walked willingly by his side He
knew so well the need for haste The gentle murmur of that engine was
inviting him all the while Yet he knew there was one thing more which
must be said

Philippa he began you know what we are doing We can escape I
believe My flight is all wonderfully arranged But there will be no
coming back It will be all over when our car passes over the hills
there You will not regret You care enough even for this supreme
sacrifice

I shall never reproach you as long as I live she promised I have
made up my mind to come and I am ready

But it is because you care he pleaded anxiously

It is because I care for one reason

In the great way he persisted In the only way

She hesitated He suddenly felt her hand grow colder in his He saw her
frame shiver beneath its weight of furs

Dont ask me quite that she begged breathlessly Be content to know
that I have counted the cost and that I am willing to come

He felt the chill of impending disaster He closed the little gate
through which they had been about to pass and stood with his back to
it In that faint light which seemed to creep over the world before the
moon itself was revealed she seemed to him at that moment the fairest
the most desirable thing on earth Her face was upturned towards his
half pathetic half protesting against the revelation which he was
forcing from her

Listen Philippa he said Miss Fairclough warned me of one thing I
put it on one side It did not seem to be possible Now I must ask you a
question You have some other motive have you not for choosing to come
away with me It is not only because you love me better than any one
else in the world as I do you and therefore that we belong to one
another and it is right and good that we should spend our lives in one
anothers company There is something else is there not at the root of
your determination Some ally

It was a strange moment for Philippa Nothing had altered within her
and yet a wonderful pity was glowing in her heart tearing at her
emotions bringing a sob into her throat

You meanHenry she faltered

I mean your husband he assented

She was suddenly passionately angry with herself It seemed to her that
the days of childishness were back She was behaving like an imbecile
whilst he played the great game

You see he went on his own voice a little unsteady this is one
of those moments in both our lives when anything except the exact truth
would mean shipwreck You still love your husband

I am such a fool she sobbed clutching at his arm

You were willing to go away with me he continued mercilessly partly
because of the anger you felt towards him and partly out of revenge
and just a little because you liked me Is that not so

Her head pressed upon his arm She nodded It was just that convulsive
movement of her head with its wealth of wonderful hair and its plain
black motoring hat which dealt the deathblow to his hopes She was
just a child once moreand she trusted him

Very well then he said just let me thinkfor a moment

She understood enough not to raise her head Lessingham was gazing out
through the chaotic shadows of the distant banks of clouds from which
the moon was rising Already the pain had begun and yet with it was
that queer sense of exaltation which comes with sacrifice

We have been very nearly foolish he told her with grave kindliness
It is well perhaps that we were in time Those windows which lead
into your librarythrough which I first came to you bytheby he
added with a strange reminiscent little sigh are they open

Yes she whispered

Come then he invited Before I leave there is something I want to
make clear to you

They made their way rather like two conspirators along the little
terraced walk Philippa opened the window and closed it again behind
them The room was empty Lessingham watching her closely almost
groaned as he saw the wonderful relief in her face She threw off the
cloak and he groaned again as he remembered how nearly it had been his
task to remove it In her plain travelling dress she turned and looked
at him very pathetically

You have perhaps a morning paper here he enquired

A newspaper Why yes the Times she answered a little surprised

He took it from the table towards which she pointed and held it under
the lamplight Presently he called to her His forefinger rested upon a
certain column

Read this he directed

She read it out in a tone which passed from surprise to blank wonder

Commander Sir Henry Cranston Baronet to receive the DSO for special
services and to be promoted to the rank of Acting RearAdmiral

What does it mean she asked feverishly Henry A DSO for Henry
for special services

It means he told her with a forced smile that your husband is as
you put it in your expressive language a fraud



CHAPTER XXXII


For a moment Philippa was unsteady upon her feet Lessingham led her to
a chair From outside came the low cautious hooting of the motor horn
calling to its dilatory passenger

I can not of course explain everything to you he began in a tone
of unusual restraint but I do know that for the last two years your
husband has been responsible to the Admiralty for most of the mine
fields around your east coast To begin with his stay in Scotland was
a sham He was most of the time with the fleet and round the coasts His
fishing excursions from here have been of the same order only more so
All the places of importance from here to the mouth of the Thames have
been mined or rather the approaches to them have been mined under
his instructions My mission in this country here at Dreymarshdo
not shrink from me if you can help itwas to obtain a copy of his mine
protection scheme of a certain town on the east coast

Why should I shrink from you she murmured This is all too
wonderful What a little beast Henry must think me she added with
truly feminine and marvellously selfish irrelevance

You and Miss Fairclough Lessingham went on have rather scoffed at
my presence here on behalf of our Secret Service It seemed to you both
very ridiculous Now you understand

It makes no difference Philippa protested tearfully You always told
us the truth

And I shall continue to do so Lessingham assured her I am not a
clever person at my work which is all new to me but fortune favoured
me the night your husband was shipwrecked I succeeded in stealing from
him on board that wrecked trawler the plan of the mine field which I
was sent over to procure

Of course you had to do it if you could Philippa sobbed I think it
was very clever of you

He smiled

There are others who might look at the matter differently he said I
am going to ask you a question which I know is unnecessary but I must
have your answer to take away with me If you had known all the time
that your husband instead of being a skulker as you thought him was
really doing splendid work for his country you would not have listened
to me for one moment would you You would not have let me grow to love
you

She clutched his hands

You are the dearest man in the world she exclaimed her lips still
quivering but as you say you know the answer I was always in love
with Henry It was because I loved him that I was so furious I liked
you so much that it was mean of me ever to think ofof what so nearly
happened

So nearly happened he repeated with a sudden access of the bitterest
selfpity

Once more the low warning hoot of the motor horn this time a
little more impatient broke the silence Philippa was filled with an
unreasoning terror

You must go she implored You must go this minute If they were to
take you I couldnt bear it And that man Griffithshe has sworn that
if he can not get the Government authority he will shoot you

Griffiths has gone to London he reminded her

Yes but he may be back by this train she cried glancing at the
clock and I have a strange sort of fancyI have had it all daythat
Henry might come too It is overdue now Any one might arrive here Oh
please for my sake hurry away she begged the tears streaming from
her eyes If anything should happen I could never forgive myself It
is because you have been so dear so true and honourable that all this
time has been wasted If it were to cost you your life


She was seized by a fit of nervous anxiety which became almost a
paroxysm She buttoned his coat for him and almost dragged him to the
door And then she stopped for a moment to listen Her eyes became
distended Her lips were parted She shook as though with an ague

It is too late she faltered hysterically I can hear Henrys voice
Quick Come to the window You must get out that way and through the
postern gate

Your husband will have seen the car he protested And besides there
is your dressingbag and your travelling coat

I shall tell him everything she declared wildly Nothing matters
except that you escape Oh hurry I can hear Henry talking to Jimmy
Dumblefor Gods sake

The words died away upon her lips The door had been opened and closed
again immediately There was the quick turn of the lock sounding like
the click of fate Sir Henry well inside the room nodded to them both
affably

Well Philippa You werent expecting me eh Hullo Lessingham Not
gone yet Running it a trifle fine arent you

Lessingham glanced towards the fastened door

Perhaps he admitted a trifle too fine

Sir Henry was suddenly taken by storm Philippa had thrown herself into
his arms Her fingers were locked around his neck Her lips her eyes
were pleading with him

Henry Henry you must forgive me I never knewI never dreamed what
you were really doing I shall never forgive myself but youyou will
be generous

Thats all right dear he promised stooping down to kiss her
Partly my fault of course I had to humour those old ladies down at
Whitehall who wanted me to pose as a particularly harmless idiot You
see he went on glancing towards Lessingham they were always afraid
that my steps might be dogged by spies if my position were generally
known

Philippa did not relinquish her attitude She was still clinging to her
husband She refused to let him go

Henry she begged oh listen to me I have so much to confess so
much of which I am ashamed And yet with it all I want to entreatto
implore one great favour from you

Sir Henry looked down into his wifes face

Is it one I can grant he asked gravely

If you want me ever to be happy again you will she sobbed For
Helens sake as well as mine help Mr Lessingham to escape

Lessingham took a quick step forward He had the air of one who has
reached the limits of his endurance

You mean this kindly Lady Cranston I know he said but I desire no
intervention

Sir Henry patted his wifes hand and held her a little away from him
There was a curious but unmistakable change in his deportment His mouth
had not altogether lost its humorous twist but his jaw seemed more
apparent the light in his eyes was keener and there was a ring of
authority in his tone

Come he said let us understand one another Philippa and you had
better listen too Mr Lessingham I can promise you that your chances
of escape will not be diminished by my taking up these few minutes of
your time Philippa he went on turning back to her you have always
posed as being an exceedingly patriotic Englishwoman yet it seems to
me that you have made a bargain with this man knowing full well that he
was in the service of Germany to give him shelter and hospitality here
access to my house and protection amongst your friends in return for
certain favours shown towards your brother

Philippa was speechless It was a view of the matter which she and Helen
had striven so eagerly to avoid

But Henry she protested his stay here seemed so harmless You
yourself have laughed at the idea of espionage at Dreymarsh There is
nothing to discover There is nothing going on here which the whole
world might not know

That was never my plea Lessingham intervened

Nor is it the truth Sir Henry added sternly

The Baron Maderstrom was sent here Philippa to spy upon me to gain
access by any means to this house to steal if he could certain plans
and charts prepared by me

Philippa began to tremble She seemed bereft of words

He told me this she faltered He told me not half an hour ago

There was a tapping at the door Sir Henry moved towards it but did not
turn the key

Who is that he asked

Captain Griffiths is here with an escort sir Mills announced He
has seized the motor car outside and he begs to be allowed to come in



CHAPTER XXXIII


Mills words were plainly audible throughout the room Philippa made
eager signs to Lessingham pointing to the French windows Lessingham
however shook his head

I prefer he said gently to finish my conversation with your
husband

There was another and more insistent summons from outside This time it
was Captain Griffiths raucous voice

Sir Henry Cranston he called out I am here with authority I beg to
be admitted

Where is your escort

In the hall

If I let you come in Sir Henry continued will you come alone

I should prefer it was the eager reply I wish to make this business
as little unpleasant toto everybody as possible

Sir Henry softly turned the key opened the door and admitted
Griffiths The man seemed to see no one else but Lessingham He would
have hastened at once towards him but Sir Henry laid his hand upon his
arm

You must kindly restrain your impatience for a few moments he
insisted This is a private conference Your business with the Baron
Maderstrom can be adjusted later

It is my duty Griffiths proclaimed impatiently to arrest that man
as a spy I have authority granted me this morning in London

Quite so Sir Henry observed but we are in the midst of a very
interesting little discussion which I intend to conclude Your turn will
come later Captain Griffiths

I can countenance no discussion with such men as that Griffiths
declared scornfully I am here in the execution of my duty and I
resent any interference with it

No one wishes to interfere with you Sir Henry assured him but until
I say the word you will obey my orders

So far as I am concerned Lessingham intervened I wish it to be
understood that I offer no defence

You have no defence Sir Henry reminded him suavely I gather that
not only had you the effrontery to steal a chart from my pocket in the
midst of a life struggle upon the trawler but you have capped this
exploit with a deliberate attempt to abduct my wife


Griffiths seemed for a moment almost beside himself His eyes glowed
His long fingers twitched He kept edging a little nearer to Lessingham

Both charges the latter confessed looking Sir Henry in the eyes
are true

Then Philippa found herself She saw the sudden flash in her husbands
eyes the grim fury in Griffiths face She stepped once more forward

Henry she insisted you must listen to what I have to say

We have had enough words Griffiths interposed savagely

Sir Henry ignored the interruption

I am listening Philippa he said calmly

It was my intention an hour ago to leave this place with Mr Lessingham
tonight she told him deliberately

The devil it was Sir Henry muttered

As for the reason you know it she continued her tone full of
courage I am willing to throw myself at your feet now but all the
same I was hardly treated I was made the scapegoat of your stupid
promise You kept me in ignorance of things a wife should know You even
encouraged me to believe you a coward when a single word from you
would have changed everything Therefore I say that it is you who are
responsible for what I nearly did and what I should have done but for
himlisten Henrybut for him

But for him her husband repeated curiously

It was Mr Lessingham she declared who opened my eyes concerning
you It was he who refused to let me yield to that impulse of anger
Look at my coat there My bag is on that table I was ready to leave
with him tonight Before we went he insisted on telling me everything
about you He could have escaped and I was willing to go with him
Instead he spent those precious minutes telling me the truth about you
That was the end

Lady Cranston omits to add Lessingham put in that before I did
so she told me frankly that her feelings for me were of warm
friendlinessthat her love was given to her husband and her husband
only

How long is this to go on Griffiths asked harshly I have
the authority here and the power to take that man These domestic
explanations have nothing to do with the case

Excuse me Sir Henry retorted with quiet emphasis they have a great
deal to do with it

I am Commandant of this place Griffiths commenced

And I possess an authority here which you had better not dispute Sir
Henry reminded him sternly

There was a moments tense silence Griffiths set his teeth hard but
his hand wandered towards the back of his belt

I am now Sir Henry continued going to announce to you a piece
of news over which we shall all be gloating when tomorrow mornings
newspapers are issued but which is not as yet generally known During
last night a considerable squadron of German cruisers managed to cross
the North Sea and found their way to a certain port of considerable
importance to us

Lessingham started His face was drawn as though with pain He had the
air of one who shrinks from the news he is about to hear

Incidentally Sir Henry continued threequarters of the squadron
also found their way to the bottom of the sea and the other quarter met
our own squadron lying in wait for their retreat and will not return

Lessingham swayed for a moment upon his feet One could almost fancy
that Sir Henrys tone was tinged with pity as he turned towards him

The chart of the mine field of which you possessed yourself he said
which it was the object of your visit here to secure was a chart
specially prepared for you You see our own Secret Service is not
altogether asleep Those very safe and invitinglooking channels for
British and Allied trafficI marked them very clearly didnt Iwere
where Id laid my mines The channels which your cruisers so carefully
avoided were the only safe avenues So you see why it is Maderstrom
that I have no grudge against you

Lessinghams face for a moment was the face of a stricken man There was
a look of dull horror in his eyes

Is this the truth he gasped

It is the truth Sir Henry assured him gravely

Does this conclude the explanations Captain Griffiths demanded
impatiently Your news is magnificent Sir Henry As regards this
felon

Sir Henry held up his hand

Maderstroms fate he said is mine to deal with and not yours
Captain Griffiths

Philippa was the first to grasp the intentions of the man who was
standing only a few feet from her She threw herself upon his arm and
dragged down the revolver which he had raised Sir Henry with a shout
of fury was upon them at once He took Griffiths by the throat and
threw him upon the sofa The revolver clattered harmlessly on to the
carpet

His Majestys Service has no use for madmen he thundered You know
that I possess superior authority here

That man shall not escape Griffiths shouted

He struggled for his whistle Sir Henry snatched it from him and picked
up the revolver from the carpet

Look here Griffiths he remonstrated severely one single move
in opposition to my wishes will cost you your career Let there be
no misunderstanding about it That man will not be arrested by you
tonight

Griffiths staggered to his feet He was half cowed half furious

You take the responsibility for this Sir Henry he demanded thickly
The man is a proved traitor If you assist him to escape you are
subject to penalties

Sir Henry threw open the door

Captain Griffiths he interrupted I am not ignorant of my position
in this matter Believe me your last chance of retaining your position
here is to remember that you have had specific orders to yield to my
authority in all matters Kindly leave this room and take your soldiers
back to their quarters

Griffiths hesitated for a single moment He had the appearance of a man
half demented by a passion which could find no outlet Then he left the
room without salute without a glance to the right or to the left Out
in the hall a moment later they heard a harsh voice of command
The hall door was opened and closed behind the sound of retreating
footsteps

Sir Henry Lessingham reminded him I have not asked for your
intervention

My dear fellow you wouldnt was the prompt reply As for the little
trouble that has happened in the North Sea dont take it too much to
heart it was entirely the fault of the people who sent you here

The fault of the people who sent me here Lessingham repeated I
scarcely understand

Its simple enough Sir Henry continued You see you are about as
fit to be a spy as Philippa my wife here is to be a detective You
possess the one insuperable obstacle of having the instincts of a
gentlemanCome come he went on we have nothing more to say to one
another Open that window and take the narrow path down to the beach
Jimmy Dumble is waiting for you at the gate He will row you out to a
Dutch trawler which is lying even now off the point

You mean me to get away Lessingham exclaimed bewildered

Believe me it will cost nothing Sir Henry assured him I was not
bluffing when I told Captain Griffiths that I had supreme authority
here He knows perfectly well that I am within my rights in aiding your
escape

Philippa moved swiftly to where Lessingham was standing She gave him
her hands

Dear friend she begged so wonderful a friend as you have been
dont refuse this last thing

Be a sensible fellow Maderstrom Sir Henry said Remember that you
cant do yourself or your adopted country a haporth of good by playing
the Quixote

Besides Philippa continued holding his hands tightly it is after
all only an exchange You have saved Henrys life set Richard free
and brought us happiness Why should you hesitate to accept your own
liberty

Sir Henry threw open the window and looked towards a green light out at
sea

Theres your trawler he pointed out and remember the tide will turn
in half an hour I dont wish to hurry you

Lessingham raised Philippas fingers to his lips

I shall think of you both always he said simply You are very
wonderful people

He turned towards the window Sir Henry took up the Homburg hat from the
table by his side

Better take your hat he suggested

Lessingham paused accepted it and looked steadfastly at the donor

You knew from the first he asked

From the very first Sir Henry assured him Dont look so
confounded he went on consolingly Remember that espionage is the
only profession in which it is an honour to fail

Philippa came a little shyly into her husbands arms as he turned back
into the room The tenderness in his own face however and a little
catch in his voice broke down at once the wall of reserve which had
grown up between them

My dear little woman he murmured My little sweetheart You dont
know how Ive ached to explain everything to youincluding the Russian
ladies

Explain them at once sir Philippa insisted pretending to draw her
face away for a moment

They were the wife and sisterinlaw of the Russian Admiral Draskieff
who was sent over to report upon our method of mine laying he told
her

You and I have to go up to a little dinner they are giving tomorrow or
the next day

Oh dear what an idiot I was Philippa exclaimed ruefully I
imaginedall sorts of things But Henry dear she went on do you
know that we have a great surprise for youhere in the house

No surprise dear he assured her shaking his head I knew the very
hour that Richard left Wittenberg And here he is by Jove

Richard and Helen entered together Philippa could not even wait for the
conclusion of the hearty but exceedingly British greeting which passed
between the two men

Listen to me both of you she cried incoherently Helen you
especially You never heard anything so wonderful in your life They
werent fishing excursions at all There werent any whiting Henry was
laying mines all the time and hes blown up half the German fleet Its
all in the Times this morning Hes got a DSOHenry hasand hes a
RearAdmiral Oh Helen I want to cry

The two women wandered into a far corner of the room Richard wrung his
brotherinlaws hand

Philippa isnt exactly coherent he remarked but it sounds all
right

You see Sir Henry explained Ive been mine laying ever since the
war started I always had ideas of my own about mine fields as you may
remember I started with Scotland and then they moved me down here
The Admiralty thought theyd be mighty clever and they insisted upon my
keeping my job secret It led to a little trouble with Philippa but I
think we are through with all thatI suppose you know that those two
young women have been engaged in a regular conspiracy Dick

I know a little Richard replied gravely and Im sure you will
believe that I wouldnt have countenanced it for a moment if Id had any
idea what they were up to

Im sure you wouldnt Sir Henry agreed Anyway it led to no harm

Maderstrom then Richard asked with a sudden more complete
apprehension of the affair was over here to spy upon you

Thats the ticket Sir Henry assented

Richard frowned

And he bribed Philippa and Helen with my liberty

Dont you worry about that his brotherinlaw begged They must have
known by instinct that a chap like Maderstrom couldnt do any harm

Where is he now Richard asked eagerly Helen insisted upon keeping
me out of the way but weve heard all sorts of rumours The Commandant
has been up here after him hasnt he

Yes and I sent him away with a flea in his ear I dont like the
fellow

And Maderstrom

The pseudoMr Lessingham eh Sir Henry observed Well to tell you
the truth Dick if there is one person I am a little sorry for in the
history of the last few weeks its Maderstrom

You too Richard exclaimed Why every one seems crazy about the
fellow

Sir Henry nodded

I remember him in your college days Dick He was a gentleman and a
good sort only unfortunately his mother was a German He did his bit of
soldiering with the Prussian Guards at the beginning of the war got a
knock and volunteered for the Secret Service They sent him over here
The fellow must have no end of pluck for as I dare say you know they
let him down from the observation car of a Zeppelin He finds his
way here all right makes his silly little bargain with our dear but
gullible womenkind and sets himself to watchto watch me mind The
whole affair is too ridiculously transparent For a time he cant bring
himself even to touch my papers here although as it happens they
wouldnt have done him the least bit of good It was only the stress
and excitement of the shipwreck last week that he ventured to steal the
chart which I had so carefully prepared for him I really think if
he hadnt done that I should have had to slip it into his pocket or
absolutely force it upon him somehow He sends it off like a lamb and
behold the result Weve crippled the German Navy for the rest of the
war

It was a faked chart then of course Richard demanded breathlessly

And quite the cleverest I ever prepared Sir Henry acknowledged I
can assure you that it would have taken in Von Tirpitz himself if hed
got hold of it

But where is Maderstrom now sir Richard asked

Sir Henry moved his head towards the window where Philippa for the
last few moments had softly taken her place Her eyes were watching
a green light bobbing up and down in the distance Suddenly she gave a
little exclamation

Its moving she cried Hes off

Hes safe on a Dutch trawler Sir Henry declared And I think he
added moving towards the sideboard its time you and I had a drink
together Dick

They helped themselves to whisky and soda There were still many
explanations to be given Halfconcealed by the curtain Philippa stood
with her eyes turned seawards The green light was dimmer now and the
low black outline of the trawler crept slowly over the glittering track
of moonlight She gave a little start as it came into sight There was
a sob in her throat tears burning in her eyes Her fingers clutched the
curtains almost passionately She stood there watching until her eyes
ached Then she felt an arm around her waist and her husbands whisper
in her ear

I havent let you wander too far have I Phil

She turned quickly towards him eager for the comfort of his extended
arms Her face was buried in his shoulder

You know she murmured

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
