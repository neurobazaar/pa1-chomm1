THE HISTORY OF TOM THUMB

It is said that in the days of the famed Prince Arthur who was king of
Britain in the year 516 there lived a great magician called Merlin
the most learned and skilful enchanter in the world at that time

This great magician who could assume any form he pleased was
travelling in the disguise of a poor beggar and being very much
fatigued he stopped at the cottage of an honest ploughman to rest
himself and asked for some refreshment

The countryman gave him a hearty welcome and his wife who was a very
goodhearted hospital woman soon brought him some milk in a wooden
bowl an some coarse brown bread on a platter

Merlin was much pleased with this homely repast and the kindness of
the ploughman and his wife but he could not help seeing that though
everything was neat and comfortable in the cottage they seemed both
be sad and much cast down He therefore questioned them on the cause
of their sadness and learned they were miserable because they had no
children

The poor woman declared with tears in her eyes that she should be the
happiest creature in the world if she had a son and although he was no
bigger than her husbands thumb she would be satisfied

Merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a mans
thumb that he made up his mind to pay a visit to the queen of the
fairies and ask her to grant the poor womans wish The droll fancy of
such a little person among the human race pleased the fairy queen
too greatly and she promised Merlin that the wish should be granted
Accordingly a short time after the ploughmans wife had a son who
wonderful to relate was not bigger than his fathers thumb

The fairy queen wishing to see the little fellow thus born into the
world came in at the window while the mother was sitting up in bed
admiring him The queen kissed the child and giving it the name of Tom
Thumb sent for some of the fairies who dressed her little favorite as
she bade them

 An oakleaf hat he had for his crown
 His shirt of web by spiders spun
 With jacket wove of thistles down
 His trowsers were of feathers done

 His stockings of applerind they tie
 With eyelash from his mothers eye
 His shoes were made of mouses skin
 Tannd with the downy hair within

It is remarkable that Tom never grew any larger than his fathers thumb
which was only of an ordinary size but as he got older he became very
cunning and full of tricks When he was old enough to play with the
boys and had lost all his own cherrystones he used to creep into
the bags of his playfellows fill his pockets and getting out unseen
would again join in the game

One day however as he was coming out of a bag of cherrystones where
he had been pilfering as usual the boy to whom it belonged chanced to
see him Ah ha my little Tommy said the boy so I have caught you
stealing my cherrystones at last and you shall be rewarded for your
thievish tricks On saying this he drew the string tight around his
neck and gave the bag such a hearty shake that poor little Toms legs
thighs and body were sadly bruised He roared out in pain and begged
to be let out promising never to be guilty of such bad practices again

A short time afterwards his mother was making a batterpudding and Tom
being very anxious to see how it was made climbed up to the edge of the
bowl but unfortunately his foot slipped and he plumped over head and
ears into the batter unseen by his mother who stirred him into the
puddingbag and put him in the pot to boil

The batter had filled Toms mouth and prevented him from crying but
on feeling the hot water he kicked and struggled so much in the pot
that his mother thought that the pudding was bewitched and instantly
pulling it out of the pot she threw it to the door A poor tinker who
was passing by lifted up the pudding and putting it into his budget
he then walked off As Tom had now got his mouth cleared of the batter
he then began to cry aloud which so frightened the tinker that he flung
down the pudding and ran away The pudding being broke to pieces by the
fall Tom crept out covered over with the batter and with difficulty
walked home His mother who was very sorry to see her darling in such
a woeful state put him into a teacup and soon washed off the batter
after which she kissed him and laid him in bed

Soon after the adventure of the pudding Toms mother went to milk her
cow in the meadow and she took him along with her As the wind was very
high fearing lest he should be blown away she tied him to a thistle
with a piece of fine thread The cow soon saw the oakleaf hat and
liking the look of it took poor Tom and the thistle at one mouthful
While the cow was chewing the thistle Tom was afraid of her great teeth
which threatened to crush him in pieces and he roared out as loud as he
could

Mother mother

Where are you Tommy my dear Tommy said his mother

Here mother replied he in the red cows mouth

His mother began to cry and wring her hands but the cow surprised
at the odd noise in her throat opened her mouth and let Tom drop out
Fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to the
ground or he would have been dreadfully hurt She then put Tom in her
bosom and ran home with him

Toms father made him a whip of barley straw to drive the cattle with
and having one day gone into the fields he slipped a foot and rolled
into the furrow A raven which was flying over picked him up and flew
with him to the top of a giants castle that was near the seaside and
there left him

Tom was in a dreadful state and did not know what to do but he was
soon more dreadfully frightened for old Grumbo the giant came up to
walk on the terrace and seeing Tom he took him up and swallowed him
like a pill

The giant had no sooner swallowed Tom than he began to repent what he
had done for Tom began to kick and jump about so much that he felt very
uncomfortable and at last threw him up again into the sea A large
fish swallowed Tom the moment he fell into the sea which was soon after
caught and bought for the table of King Arthur When they opened the
fish in order to cook it every on was astonished at finding such a
little boy and Tom was quite delighted to be out again They carried
him to the king who made Tom his dwarf and he soon grew a great
favorite at court for by his tricks and gambols he not only amused the
king and queen but also all the knights of the Round Table

It is said that when the kind rode out on horseback he often took
Tom along with him and if a shower came on he used to creep into his
majestys waistcoat pocket where he slept till the rain was over

King Arthur one day asked Tom about his parents wishing to know if they
were as small as he was and whether rich or poor Tom told the king
that his father and mother were as tall as any of the persons about
the court but rather poor On hearing this the king carried Tom to the
treasure the place where he kept all his money and told him to take
as much money as he could carry home to his parents which made the poor
little fellow caper with joy Tom went immediately to fetch a purse
which was made of a waterbubble and then returned to the treasury
where he got a silver threepennypiece to put into it

Our little hero had some trouble in lifting the burden upon his back
but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind and set
forward on his journey However without meeting with any accidents and
after resting himself more than a hundred times by the way in two days
and two nights he reached his fathers house in safety

Tom had travelled fortyeight hours with a huge silverpiece on his
back and was almost tired to death when his mother ran out to meet
him and carried him into the house

Toms parents were both happy to see him and the more so as he had
brought such an amazing sum of money with him but the poor little
fellow was excessively wearied having travelled half a mile in
fortyeight hours with a huge silver threepennypiece on his back
His mother in order to recover him placed him in a walnut shell by the
fireside and feasted him for three days on a hazel nut which made him
very sick for a whole nut used to serve him a month

Tom was soon well again but as there had been a fall of rain and the
ground was very wet he could not travel back to King Arthurs court
therefore his mother one day when the wind was blowing in that
direction made a little parasol of cambric paper and tying Tom to it
she gave him a puff into the air with her mouth which soon carried him
to the kings palace

Just at the time when Tom came flying across the courtyard the cook
happened to be passing with the kings great bowl of furmenty which was
a dish his majesty was very fond of but unfortunately the poor little
fellow fell plump into the middle of it and splashed the hot furmenty
about the cooks face

The cook who was an illnatured fellow being in a terrible rage at Tom
for frightening and scalding him with the furmenty went straight to the
king and said that Tom had jumped into the royal furmenty and thrown
it down out of mere mischief The king was so enraged when he heard
this that he ordered Tom to be seized and tried for high treason and
there being no person who dared to plead for him he was condemned to be
beheaded immediately

On hearing this dreadful sentence pronounced poor Tom fell atrembling
with fear but seeing no means of escape and observing a miller close
to him gaping with his great mouth as country boobies do at a far he
took a leap and fairly jumped down his throat This exploit was done
with such activity that not one person present saw it and even the
miller did not know the trick which Tom had played upon him Now as
Tom had disappeared the court broke up and the miller went home to his
mill

When Tom heard the mill at work he knew he was clear of the court and
therefore he began to tumble and roll about so that the poor miller
could get no rest thinking he was bewitched so he sent for a doctor
When the doctor came Tom began to dance and sing and the doctor being
as much frightened as the miller sent in haste for five other doctors
and twenty learned men

When they were debating about this extraordinary case the miller
happened to yawn when Tom seizing the chance made another jump and
alighted safely upon his feet in the middle of the table

The miller who was very much provoked at being tormented by such a
little pygmy creature fell into a terrible rage and laying hold of
Tom ran to the king with him but his majesty being engaged with state
affairs ordered him to be taken away and kept in custody till he sent
for him

The cook was determined that Tom should not slip out of his hands this
time so he put him into a mousetrap and left him to peep through the
wires Tom had remained in the trap a whole week when he was sent for
by King Arthur who pardoned him for throwing down the furmenty
and took him again into favor On account of his wonderful feats of
activity Tom was knighted by the king and went under the name of the
renowned Sir Thomas Thumb As Toms clothes had suffered much in the
batterpudding the furmenty and the insides of the giant miller and
fishes his majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes and to be mounted
as a knight

 Of Butterflys wings his shirt was made
 His boots of chickens hide
 And by a nimble fairy blade
 Well learned in the tailoring trade

 His clothing was supplied
 A needle dangled by his side
 A dapper mouse he used to ride
 Thus strutted Tom in stately pride

 It was certainly very diverting to see Tom in this dress and
mounted on the mouse as he rode out ahunting with the king and
nobility who were all ready to expire with laughter at Tom and his fine
prancing charger

One day as they were riding by a farmhouse a large cat which was
lurking about the door made a spring and seized both Tom and his
mouse She then ran up a tree with them and was beginning to devour the
mouse but Tom boldly drew his sword and attacked the cat so fiercely
that she let them both fall when one of the nobles caught him in his
hat and laid him on a bed of down in a little ivory cabinet

The queen of fairies came soon after to pay Tom a visit and carried him
back to Fairyland where he lived several years During his residence
there King Arthur and all the persons who knew Tom had died and as
he was desirous of being again at court the fairy queen after dressing
him in a suit of clothes sent him flying through the air to the palace
in the days of king Thunstone the successor of Arthur Every one
flocked round to see him and being carried to the king he was asked
who he waswhence he cameand where he lived Tom answered

 My name is Tom Thumb
 From the fairies Ive come
 When King Arthur shone
 His court was my home
 In me he delighted
 By him I was knighted
 Did you never hear of Sir Thomas Thumb

The king was so charmed with this address that he ordered a little
chair to be made in order that Tom might sit upon his table and also
a palace of gold a span high with a door an inch wide to live in He
also gave him a coach drawn by six small mice

The queen was so enraged at the honor paid to Sir Thomas that she
resolved to ruin him and told the king that the little knight had been
saucy to her

The king sent for Tom in great haste but being fully aware of the
danger of royal anger he crept into an empty snailshell where he lay
for a long time until he was almost starved with hunger but at last he
ventured to peep out and seeing a fine large butterfly on the ground
near his hidingplace he approached very cautiously and getting
himself placed astride on it was immediately carried up into the air
The butterfly flew with him from tree to tree and from field to field
and at last returned to the court where the king and nobility all
strove to catch him but at last poor Tom fell from his seat into a
wateringpot in which he was almost drowned

When the queen saw him she was in a rage and said he should be
beheaded and he was again put into a mousetrap until the time of his
execution

However a cat observing something alive in the trap patted it about
till the wires broke and set Thomas at liberty

The king received Tom again into favor which he did not live to enjoy
for a large spider one day attacked him and although he drew his sword
and fought well yet the spiders poisonous breath at last overcame him

 He fell dead on the ground where he stood
 and the spider suckd every drop of his blood

King Thunstone and his whole court were so sorry at the loss of their
little favorite that they went into mourning and raised a fine white
marble monument over his grave with the following epitaph

 Here lyes Tom Thumb King Arthurs knight
 Who died by a spiders cruel bite
 He was well known in Arthurs court
 Where he afforded gallant sport
 He rode at tilt and tournament
 And on a mouse ahunting went
 Alive he filled the court with mirth
 His death to sorrow soon gave birth
 Wipe wipe your eyes and shake your head
 And cryAlas Tom Thumb is dead







THE CAT AND THE MOUSE

 The cat and the mouse

The cat bit the mouses tail off Pray puss give me my tail No

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
