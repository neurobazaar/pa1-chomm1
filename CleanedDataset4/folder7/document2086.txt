CHAPTER 1

THE AVORIES

Once upon a time there was a nice family Its name was Avory and it
lived in an old house in Chiswick where the Thames is so sad on grey
days and so gay on sunny ones

Mror rather CaptainAvory was dead he had been wounded at Spion
Kop and died a few years after Mrs Avory was thirtyfive and she
had four children The eldest was Janet aged fourteen and the
youngest was Gregory Bruce aged seven Between these came Robert
Oliver who was thirteen and Hester who was nine

They were all very fond of each other and they rarely quarreled If
they had done so I should not be telling this story You dont catch
me writing books about people who quarrel They adored their mother

The name of the Avories house was The Gables which was a better
name than many houses have because there actually were gables in its
roof Hester who had funny ideas wanted to see all the people who
lived in all the houses that are called The Gables everywhere drawn
up in a row so that she might examine them She used to lie awake at
night and wonder how many there would be Im sure mother would be the
most beautiful anyway she used to say

History was Hesters passion She could read history all day Here she
differed from Robert Oliver who was all for geography Their friends
knew of these tastes of course and so Hesters presents were nearly
always history books or portraits of great men such as Napoleon and
Shakespeare both of whom she almost worshipped while Roberts were
compasses and maps He also had a mapmeasurer from Mr Lenox and at
the moment at which this story opens his birthday being just over he
was the possessor of a pedometer which he carried fastened to his leg
under his knickerbockers so that it was certain to register every time
he took a step He kept a careful record of the distance he had walked
since his birthday and could tell you at any time what it was if you
gave him a minute or two to crawl under the table and undo his clothes
He could be heard grunting in dark places all day long having been
forbidden by Janet to undress in public

Roberts birthday was on June 20 Hesters on November 8 and Janets
on February 28 She had the narrowest escape you see of getting
birthdays only once in every four years which is one of the worst
things that can happen to a human being Gregory Bruce was a little
less lucky for his birthday was on December 20 which is so near to
Christmas Day that mean persons have been known to make one gift do for
both events None the less Gregorys possessions were very numerous
for he had many friends and most of them were careful to keep these
two great anniversaries apart

Gregorys particular passion just now was the names of engines of
which he had one of the finest collections in Europe but a model
aeroplane which Mr Scott had given him was beginning to turn his
thoughts towards the conquest of the air and whereas he used to tell
people that he meant to be an engine driver when he grew up he was now
adding or a man like Wilbur Wright

Most children have wanted to fly ever since Peter Pan began and as
I dare say you have heard some have tried from the nursery window
with perfectly awful results having neglected to have their shoulders
first touched magically but Gregory Bruce Avory wanted to fly in a
more regular and scientific manner He wanted to fly like an engineer
To his mind indeed the flying part of Peter Pan was the least
fascinating he preferred the underground home and the fight with the
Indians and the mechanism of the crocodile For a short time in fact
his only ambition had been to be the crocodiles front half

Janet on the other hand liked Nana and the pathetic motherly parts
the best Roberts favourite was Smee and often at meal times he used
to say Woe is me I have no knife while Hester was happiest in the
lagoon scene This difference of taste in one small family shows how
important it is for anyone who writes a play to put a lot of variety
into it

Janet the eldest was also the most practical She was in fact
towards the others almost more of a younger mother than an elder
sister Not that Mrs Avory neglected them at all but Janet relieved
her of many little duties She always knew when their feet were likely
to be wet and Robert had once said that she had stocking changing on
the brain She could cook too especially cakes and the tradesmen
had a great respect for her judgment when she went shopping She knew
when a joint would be too fat and you should see her pointing out the
bone

Janet was a tall girl and very active and in spite of her
responsibilities very jolly She played hockey as well almost as a
boy which is of course saying everything and her cricket was good
too Her bowling was fast and straight and usually too much for
Robert who knew however the initials of all the gentlemen and the
Christian names and birthplaces of most of the professionals Gregory
could not bear cricket except when it was his own innings which he
seemed to enjoy during its brief duration Hester thought it dull
throughout so that Janet had to depend upon Robert and the Rotherams
for the best games

Janet had very straight fair hair and just enough freckles to be
pretty She looked nicest in blue Hester on the contrary was a dark
little thing whose best frock was always red

As for the boysit doesnt matter what boys are like but Gregory I
might say usually had black hands not because he was naturally a
grubby little beast but because engineers do Robert on the contrary
was disposed to be dressy and he declined to allow his mother or Janet
to buy his socks or neckties without first consulting him as to colours

Among the friends of the family must be put first Uncle Chris who was
Captain Avorys brother and a lawyer in Golden Square Uncle Chris
looked after Mrs Avorys money and gave advice He was very nice and
came to dinner every Sunday hot roast beef and horse radish sauce
There was an Aunt Chris too but she was an invalid and could not
leave her room where she lay all the time and remembered birthdays

Next to Uncle Chris came Mr Scott who was a famous author and a very
good cricketer on the lawn and Mr Lenox who was private secretary to
a real lord and therefore had lots of time and money Both Mr Scott
and Mr Lenox were bachelors as the best friends of families always
are unless of course their wives are invalids

Gregory who was more social than Robert also knew one policeman one
coachman three chauffeurs and several Chiswick boatmen extremely
intimately Roberts principal friend outside the family was a bird
stuffer in Hammersmith but he does not come into this story

The Avories did not go to boarding school or indeed to any school in
the ordinary way at all Mrs Avory said she could not spare them
Instead they were visited every day except Saturdays by Mr Crawley and
Miss Bingham who taught them the things that one is supposed to
knowMr Crawley taking the boys in the old billiard room and Miss
Bingham the girls in the morning room At some of the lessonssuch as
historythey all joined The classes were attended also by the
Rotherams the doctors children who lived at Fir Grove and Horace
Campbell the only son of the vicar So it was a kind of school after
all

Horace Campbell had always intended to be a cowboy when he grew up but
a visit to a play called Raffles was now rather inclining him to
gentlemanly burglary William Rotheram like Gregory leaned towards
flying but Jack Rotheram voted steadily for the sea and talked of
little but Osborne

Mary Rotheram played with a bat almost as straight as Plum Warners
and she knew most of the old Somersetshire songsMowing the Barley
and Lord Rendal and Seventeen come Sundayby heart and sang them
beautifully Gregory who used to revel in Sankeys hymns as sung by
Eliza Pollard the parlourmaid now thought that the Somerset music was
the only real kind Mary Rotheram had a snub nose and quantities of
freckle and a very nice nature

The Gables had a large garden with a shrubbery of evergreens in it
and a cedar It was not at all a gardenparty garden because there was
a wellworn cricketpitch right in the middle of the lawn and Gregory
had a railway system where the best flowers ought to be but it was a
garden full of fun and old Kink the gardener managed to get a great
many vegetables out of it too although not so many as Collins thought
he ought to

Collins was the cook a fat smiling hot lady of about fifty who had
been with Mrs Avory ever since she married Collins understood
children thoroughly and made cakes that were rather wet underneath
Her Yorkshire pudding for Sundays dinner was famous and her horse
radish sauce was so perfect that it brought tears to the eyes

Collins collected picture postcards and adored the family She had
never been cross to any of them but her way with the butchers boy and
the grocers boy and the fishmongers boy was terrible

She snapped their heads off so to speak every morning and old Kink
spent quite a lot of his time in rubbing from off the backdoor the
awful things they wrote about her in chalk

The parlourmaid was Eliza Pollard who had red hair and a kind heart
but was continually falling out with her last young man and getting
another She told Hester all about it Hester had a special knack of
being told about the servants young men for she knew also all about
those of Eliza Pollards predecessors

The housemaid was Jane Masters who helped Eliza Pollard to make the
beds Jane Masters did not hold with fickleness in lovein fact she
couldnt abide itand therefore she was steadily true to a young man
called Erb who looked after the lift at the Stores and was a
particular friend of Gregorys in consequence No man who had charge of
a lift could fail to be admired by Gregory

Finallyand very likely she ought to have come firstwas Runcie or
Mrs Runciman who had not only been the nurse of all the Avories but
of Mrs Avory before them when Mrs Avory was a slip of a girl named
Janet Easton Runcie was then quite young herself and why she was
suddenly called Mrs no one ever quite knew for she had never married
And now she was getting on for sixty and had not much to do except
sympathize with the Avories and reprove the servants She had a nice
sitting room of her own where she sat comfortably every afternoon when
such work as she did was done and received visits from her pets as
she called the children none of whom however was quite so dear to
her as their mother and listened to their adventures

On those evenings on which he came to The Gables Mr Lenox always
looked in on her for a little gossip and this was called his runcible
spoonthe joke being that Mr Lenox and Runcie were engaged to be
married

And now you know the Avory family root and branch



CHAPTER 2

THE SOUND OF MYSTERIOUS WHEELS

One day in late June the Avories and the Rotherams and Horace Campbell
were sitting at tea under the cedar talking about a great tragedy that
had befallen For Mrs Avory had just heard that Mrs Dudeneytheir
regular landlady at Sea View in the Isle of Wight where they had
lodgings every summer for years and years and where they were all
ready to go next month as usualMrs Avory had just heard that Mrs
Dudeney had been taken very ill and no other rooms were to be had

Here was a blow For the Rotherams always went to Sea View too and had
a tent on the little strip of beach under the wood adjoining the
Avories and they did everything together And now it was very likely
that the Avories would not get lodgings at all and certainly would not
get any half so good as Mrs Dudeneys where their ways were known
and their bathing dresses were always dried at once in case they wanted
to go in again and so on

They were all discussing this together and saying what a shame it was
when suddenly the unfamiliar sound of the opening of the old stableyard
gates was heard and then heavy wheels scrunched in and mens voices
called out directions such as Steady Joe A little bit to the
near side Bill and so forth

Now since the stable yard had not been used for years it was no
wonder that the whole party was so to speak on tiptoe longing to run
and investigate But Mrs Avory had always objected very strongly to
inquisitiveness and so they stayed where they were and waited
expectantly And then after a minute or so Kink came up to the table
with a twinkle in his old eye and a letter in his old hand

Didnt we hear the sound of a carriage Mrs Avory asked

Did you mum said old Kink who was a great tease

Im sure there were wheels said Mrs Avory

Kink said nothing

Of course there were wheels said Robert Dont be such an old
humbug

But Kink only twinkled

Its only coals said Gregory isnt it

The first Ive heard of coals said Kink

Kinky dear said Janet is it something awfully exciting

Nothing very exciting about a house that I know of Miss Janet said
Kink

A house cried Janet It couldnt have been a house

Theres all sorts of houses said Kink theres houses on the ground
and theres houses on

O Kinky cried Hester I know

And she clapped her hands and absolutely screamed I know Its a
caravan

A caravan the children shouted together and with one movement they
dashed off to see

Old Kink laughed and Mrs Avory laughed

Its a caravan right enough he said And a very pretty one too and
none of they nasty gypsies in it neither

But where does it come from Mrs Avory asked and in reply Kink
handed her the letter but she had done no more than open it when Janet
ran back to drag her to see the wonderful sight

Gregory I need hardly say was already on the box with the whip in his
hand while all the others were inside except Horace Campbell who had
climbed on the roof and was telephoning down the chimney The men and
horse that had brought it were gone

Oh mother cried Hester whose is it Is it ours

I expect the letter tells us everything said Mrs Avory and
sitting on the top of the steps she unfolded the letter and after
looking through read it aloud

This is what it said

DEAR CHILDREN

It has long been my wish to give you a new kind of present but I have
hitherto had no luck I thought once of an elephant and even wrote to
Jamrach about the ideaa small elephant not a mountainbut I gave
that up Chiswick is too crowded and your garden is too small But now
I think I have found the very thing A caravan It belonged to a lady
artist who having to live abroad wished to sell it and it is now
yours I tell you this so that mother need not be afraid that it is
dirty It should reach you this week and can stand in the old coach
house until you are ready to set forth on the discovery of your native
land I should have liked also to have added a horse and a man but you
must do that and keep an account of what everything costs and let me
know when I come back from abroad I shall expect some day a long
account of your adventures and if you keep a logbook so much the
better

I am
 Your true if unsettling friend
 X

PSYou will find a use for the enclosed key sooner or later and if
you want to write to me address the letter to X care of Smithurst
and Wynn Lincolns Inn Fields WC


For a while after the letter was finished the Avories were too excited
and thoughtful to speak while as for the Rotherams and Horace
Campbell however they may have tried they could not disguise an
expression if not exactly of envy certainly of disappointment There
was no X in their family

May we really go away in it and discover England Robert asked

I suppose so said Mrs Avory

Then that makes Sea View all right said Gregory Because this will
do instead

The poor Rotherams Sea View had suddenly become tame and almost
tiresome

Mrs Avory saw their regrets in their faces and cheered them up by the
remark that the caravan must sometimes be lent to others

Oh yes said Janet

Do you think Dr Rotheram would let you go she asked Mary

Of course he would said Jack But I wish it was a houseboat

The suggestion was so idiotic that everyone fell on him in scorn

But who is X Mrs Avory asked

The letter was written in a round office hand that told nothing Mr
Scott was the most likely person but why should Mr Scott hide He
never had done such a thing Or Mr Lenox But neither was it his way
to be secret and mysterious Nor was it Uncle Christophers

When however you have a caravan given you and it is standing there
waiting to be explored the question who gave it or did not give it
becomes unimportant

Gregory put the case in a nutshell Never mind about old X now he
said Lets make a thorough examination



CHAPTER 3

THE THOROUGH EXAMINATION

It was a real caravan That is to say either gypsies might have lived
in it or anyone that did live in it would soon be properly gipsified
It was painted in gay colours and had little white blinds with very
neat waists and red sashes round them That is the right kind of
caravan The brown caravans highly varnished are wrong they may be
more luxurious but no gypsy would look at them

The body of it was greena good apple greenand the panels were lined
with blue Some people say that blue and green wont go together but
dont let us take any notice of them Just look at the bed of
forgetmenots or a copse of bluebells or for that matter try to
see the Avories caravan The window frames and bars were white The
spokes and hubs of the wheels were red It was most awfully gay

Insidebut the inside of a caravan is so exciting that I hardly know
how to hold my pen The inside of a caravan Can you imagine a better
phrase than that I cant If Coleridges statement is true that poetry
is the best words in the best order then that is the best poem the
inside of a caravan

The caravan was sixteen feet six inches long and six feet two inches
high inside From the ground it stood ten feet It was six feet four
inches wide If you measure these distances in the dining room you
will see how big it was and you will be able to imagine yourselves in
it

The woodwork was all highly varnished and very new and clean More
than halfway down the caravan were heavy curtains hanging across it
and behind these was the bedroom containing four beds two on each
wall on hinged shelves that could be let down flat against the
wallby day when the folding chairs could be unfolded and the bedroom
then became a little boudoir

The floor space was however filled this afternoon with great bundles
which turned out to be gypsy tents and sleeping sacks For the boys
and Kink to sleep in said Janet but we must be very careful about
waterproof sheeting on the ground first

The rest of the caravan between the door and the bedroomabout ten
feetwas the kitchen and living room Here every inch of the wall was
used either by chairs that folded back like those in the corridors of
railway carriages or by shelves racks cupboards or pegs There were
two tables which also folded to the wall

The stove was close to the door but of course no one who lives in a
caravan ever uses the stove except when it is raining You make the
fire out of doors at all other times and swing the pot from three
sticks Hedgehog stew Cant you smell it There were kitchen
utensils on hooks and racks on each side of the stove which was covered
in with shining brass and rows of enameled cups and saucers and
plates and knives and forks The living room floor was covered with
linoleum the bedroom floor had a carpet Swinging candlesticks were
screwed into the wall here and there It was more like the cabin of a
ship than anything on land could ever be and Jack Rotheram began to
weaken towards it

In course of time other things were discovered showing what a thorough
person X was A large India rubber bath for instance and a bath
sheet to go under it A Beatrice oil stove and oil An electric torch
for sudden requirements at night A teabasket for picnics Quantities
of cartoil A piece of pumice stone very thoughtful There was also
a box of little India rubber pads with tintacks the use for which not
discovered till later was to prevent the rattling of the furniture by
making it fit a little better And in one of the cupboards was a bottle
of camphor pills and a tin of tobacco labeled For Tramps and Gypsies

There was even a bookshelf with books on it Hans Andersen The
Arabian Nights Lavengro Inquire Within Mrs Beeton
Bradshaw rather cowardly Robert thought and The Blue Poetry
Book There was also The Whole Art of Caravaning with certain
passages marked in pencil such as this

We pull up to measure the breadth of the gate and if it be broad
enough send forward an ambassador to the farm who shall explain that
we would fain camp here that we are not gypsies vagabonds or
suspicious characters that we will leave all as we find it and will
not rob or wantonly destroy And in case of need he shall delicately
hint that we may incidentally provide good custom in butter eggs
milk and half a dozen other things Our ambassador must also if it be
possible secure a stall for the horse

And this useful reminder

We must have water near at hand and a farm within reasonable distance
and we should look for shelter from prevailing winds We must avoid
soft ground and it is a mistake to camp in long grass unless the
weather be particularly dry We should be as far as possible from the
road if there is much traffic upon it It is great advantage if there
is a stream or lake at hand for bathing An old pasture field sloping
away from the road will often satisfy our requirements in lowlying
districts And up among the moors we shall be content to take a piece
of level ground where we can find it There will be nothing to disturb
us there

And this excellent caravan poem

 I love the gentle office of the cook
 The cheerful stove the placid twilight hour
 When with the tender fragrance of the flower
 And all the bubbling voices of the brook

 The coy potato or the onion browns
 The tender steak takes on a nobler hue
 I ponder mid the falling of the dew
 And watch the lapwings circling oer the downs

 Like portals at the pathway of the moon
 Two trees stand forth in pencilled silhouette
 Against the steelgrey sky as black as jet
 The steak is ready Ah too soon too soon

So much with one exception for the inside of the caravan Underneath
it were still other things for a box with perforated sides swung
between the wheels and this was the larger always cool and shady
except as Janet remarked on dusty days and near it on hooks were a
hanging saucepan a great kettle two pails and two market baskets a
nose bag and a skid Close by was a place for oats and chaff

A new set of harness was packed on the box and it was so complete that
on each of the little brass ornaments that hang on the horses chest
was the letter A On the back of the caravan was a shelf that might
be let down making a kind of sideboard for outdoor meals

For two or three days the caravan did nothing but hold receptions
Everyone who knew the Avories came to see iteven Roberts bird
stuffer who said he would like to borrow it for a weeks holiday in
Epping Forest and observe Nature through its windows Several of
Gregorys intimates also examined it and approved Miss Bingham
pronounced it elegant and commodious and Mr Crawley who like all
schoolmasters and tutors made too many puns said that its probable
rate of speed reminded him of his name Collins wished she might never
have to cook in it but otherwise was very tolerant Eliza Pollard said
that her choice would be a motor car and Jane Masters brought Erb
back on Sunday afternoon and they examined it together and decided
that with such a home as that they might be married at once

I have left till the last the most exciting thing of all In an
enclosure you remember was a key concerning the purpose of which
nothing was said in the letter Well in the course of the exploration
of the caravan which went on for some days always yielding a fresh
discovery Robert came upon a box securely fastened to the floor in a
dark corner

Mother mother he cried wheres that key Ive found a mysterious
keyhole

They all hurried to the stable yard to see and Robert swiftly inserted
the key and turned it He fell back too much overcome to speak The
box contained twentyfive new sovereigns



CHAPTER 4

THE ITEMS

Mr Lenox either knew everything or knew someone who knew everything
so that he was always certain to be able to help in any difficulty
Mrs Avory wrote to him to come round and consult with her about it
and he was there at tea time

A caravan he said after she had finished Ripping Nothing better

Yes said Mrs Avory but

Oh well said Mr Lenox thats all right A few little bothers
but soon over He checked them off on his finger Itemas your old
Swan of Avon Hester would sayitem a driver

I was thinking of Kink said Mrs Avory but theres the garden

Yes said Mr Lenox and theres also Kink Do you think hed go

The best thing to do is to ask him said Mrs Avory Gregory just
run and bring Kink in

Kink soon appeared fresh from the soil

Would you be willing to drive the caravan if we decided to use it
Mrs Avory asked

If cried the children Steady on mother If

Kink who was a great tease pretended to think for quite a long time
until his silence had driven the children nearly desperate Yes he
then said I should mum provided you let me find a trustworthy man
to go on with the garden Otherwise I shouldnt dare to face Mrs
Collins when I came back

Thats very kind of you Kink said Mrs Avory

Good old Kinky said Gregory

Yes said Mr Lenox And now for item two The horse How would you
go to work to get a horse Kink

Well said Kink thats a little out of my way A horse radish yes
but not a horse

Everyone laughed the old man expected it

Then said Mr Lenox with a mock sigh I suppose the horse will
have to be found by me We dont want to buy oneonly to hire it

Dont lets have a horse said Gregory lets have a motor I think
a motor caravan would be splendid

There youre quite wrong said Mr Lenox The lifeblood of a
caravan is sloth the lifeblood of a motor is speed You cant mix
them And how could Robert here survey England creditably if he rushed
through it in a motor Youre going to survey England arent you
Bobbie No it must be a horse and I will get it I will make friends
with cabmen and coachmen and grooms and stableboys I will carry a
straw in my mouth I will get a horse to do you credit What colour
would you like

White said Janet

It shall be a white horse said Mr Lenox And now he added the
way is cleared for item three Can you guess what that is

They all tried to guess but could not They were too excited

A dog said Mr Lenox

Oh yes they cried

To guard the caravan at night and when we are away said Janet

Exactly said Mr Lenox And what kind of a dog

A dachshund said Hester

Too small said Mr Lenox

A St Bernard said Robert

Too mild said Mr Lenox

A spaniel said Janet

Too gentle said Mr Lenox

A foxterrier said Gregory

Not strong enough said Mr Lenox I leave it to Mr Lenox said
Mrs Avory

Very well then said Mr Lenox a retrievera retriever because
it is big and formidable and also because when tied up it will
always be on the watch Well buy the _Exchange_ and _Mart_ and look
up retrievers We cant hire a dog we must buy outright there Now
then Bobbie item four

Maps said Bobbie

Right said Mr Lenox I wish I was coming with you

Do they all cried

I cant said Mr Lenox If I were to go away before September I
should get the sack and then I should starve His Lordship is
sufficiently cross with me now because I had to give him out
legbefore at the annual estate match last Saturday when I was
umpiring He couldnt stand anything else

That night Mrs Avory Uncle Christopher Mr Scott and Mr Lenox were
talking after dinner

Its a very wonderful present said Mrs Avory but there are two
things about it that are not quite satisfactory One is that one likes
to know where such gifts come from and the other is that for a party
of children to go away alone with only Kink is a great
responsibility Thats a word which mothers are very fond of
Suppose theyre ill

Its a risk you must take said Uncle Chris Dont anticipate
trouble

Because Mrs Avory went on I should not go with them although I
might arrange to meet them here and there on their journey They would
like me to be with them I know and they would like to be without me
I know

I shouldnt worry about the giver of the present said Mr Scott
You have many friends from whom you would have no objection to accept
a caravan and theres no harm in one of those friends wishing to be
anonymous As for the other matter I dont see much risk so long as
Kink goes too Hes a careful and very capable old sport and Janets
as good a mother as you any day

Mrs Avory laughed Yes I know that she said But what about
gypsies and tramps

One has always got to take a few chances said Uncle Christopher
They may get things stolen now and then from the outside of the
caravan but I should doubt if anything else happened Kink and a good
dog would see to that And Janet would see to the children keeping dry
or getting dry quickly after rain and so forth Such an experience as
a fortnight in a caravan of their own should be a splendid thing for
all of them Gregory for exampleits quite time that he studied the
A B C of engineering and began where James Watt began instead of
merely profiting by the efforts of all the investigators since then I
mean its quite time he watched a kettle boil and Hester would get no
harm by mixing a little washingup with her Romeo and Juliet
woolgathering

I think youre right said Mrs Avory and Im sure they are very
unlikely to get any such experience here But I shall be very nervous

No you wont said Mr Lenox because well arrange that you shall
have news I have thought of that A telegram every morning at
breakfast and a telegram every evening after tea That will be
perfectly simple And letters of course

In this way it was settled that the Great Experiment might be tried
especially as so wise a woman as Collins and so old an ally as Runcie
were not against it Both indeed were of Uncle Christophers opinion
that the selfhelp and selfreliance which the caravan would lead to
would be of the greatest use

Collins when she heard later some hint of the possible route the
caravan would follow became not only a supporter of the scheme but an
enthusiast because her own home was not distant and she made the
children promise to spend a day there with her brother the farmer She
also gave Janet some lessons in fryingpan cooking

Runcie never became an enthusiast but she allowed herself to be
interested if cautionary

To think of the nice comfortable beds you will be leaving she would
say

A horse is a vain thing for safety she would say

The blisters youll get on your poor feet she would say

The indigestion she would say

Living like gypsies she would say

No proper washing or anything she would say

Cheer up Runcie Gregory would reply youre not going

And glad I am Im not she would answer

I wish you were Runcie and then wed show you in the villages as
The OldWomanWhoCantSeeAnyFuninCaravaning Walk up Walk up A
penny a peep

A clever dog He knows the difference between an attack and a feeling
of faintness But just come down to the Bricklayers Arms and Ill
show you

No thank you said Mr Lenox hastily How much is he

Three pounds said Mr Amos

Oh come said Mr Lenox Not for a publichouse dog

Not a penny less said Mr Amos



CHAPTER 5

DIOGENES AND MOSES

The Sea View disappointment being so keenly felt Mrs Avory decided to
give the children an extra holiday of a fortnight at once in which to
taste the delights of the caravan and meanwhile she would herself go
down to the Isle of Wight to try to find other rooms and it was
arranged that Mary Rotheram and one of her brothers and Horace Campbell
should be squeezed into the party too Jack and William Rotheram
therefore tossed up for it and Jack won

This suddenness as we shall see was very fortunate but it threw Mr
Lenox into a state of perspiration quite strange to him

My dear Jenny he said to Mrs Avory how am I to get a horse to do
you credit if you hurry me so A horse is an animal requiring the most
careful study Each one of its four legs needs separate consideration
I should have liked some weeks of thought The dog too Just as there
is only one satisfactory horse in the world for each family so is
there only one satisfactory dog and you ask me to get both in a few
minutes

He lay back and fanned himself

Then he pulled two pennies from his pocket and gave them to Gregory
and told him to go to the station bookstall and bring back the
_Exchange_ and _Mart_

The _Exchange_ and _Mart_ as perhaps you may not know is without any
exaggeration the most delightful paper in the world It contains
nothing that one dislikes to read about such as accidents murders
suicides politics and criticisms of concerts it contains nothing
whatever of such things while on the other hand it is packed with
matters of real interest It tells you who has dogs for sale and
rabbits for sale and magiclanterns for sale and cameras for sale
and bicycles for sale and guineapigs for saleall at a
bargainand it tells you also who wants to buy rabbits and cameras
and guineapigs and it also tells you who wants to exchange rabbits
for a gun or a dog for a fishingrod or a gramophone for a parrot

Gregory brought the paper back and Mr Lenox at once turned to the
section entitled The Kennel and then to the subsection Retrievers
and he found the names of three persons who wished to sell wonderful
specimens of that breed

Two were in London and one was at Harrow

Gregory therefore went off to find a taxicab no easy thing at
Chiswick and coming back with one at last Mr Lenox and he drove to
the nearest of the London addresses

The first was no good at all The retrievers were all puppies so
gentle and playful that they would not have frightened even a mouse
from the caravan door But the next which was at Bermondsey was
better Here in a small backyard they found Mr Amos the advertiser
surrounded by kennels He was a little man with a squint and he
declared that he had nothing but the bestbred dogs with the longest
pedigrees

But we dont want anything so swagger as that said Mr Lenox

We want a watchdog to be kept on a chain but friendly enough with his
own people If you keep only pedigree dogs we may as well get on to
our next address

Mr Amos stepped between Mr Lenox and the door Its most
extraordinary odd he said for although I make it almost a religion
never to have any but pedigree dogs it happens that just at this very
moment I have got for the first time in my whole career an inferior
animal Its not mine Oh no Im only taking care of it for a friend
But its a retriever all right and a good one mark you though not a
pedigree dog My friend wants a good home for it Hes very particular
about that Kind nice people you know Bones I dare say you know
him Mr Amos added Mr Bateman who keeps the Bricklayers Arms

How funny Gregory thought to keep bricklayers arms And he wondered
why the bricklayers didnt keep their own arms and who kept their
legs and he might have asked if Mr Amos had not called to a boy named
Jim to bring Tartar over here and look slippy

While Jim was bringing Tartarwho lived in a tub and must therefore
Mr Lenox said be called in future DiogenesMr Amos reminded them
how much more likely one is to get good watchwork from a dog who is
not of the highest breeding than from a prizewinner As I often say
he added you can have too much blood that you can Too much blood
Its the only fault of many of my dogs

Diogenes now stood before them looking by no means overburdened with
blood and extremely ready for a new home

Mr Lenox asked why Mr Amos thought he was a good watchdog

Think said Mr Amos I dont think I know If Mr Bateman was here
and you were to hit him that dog would kill you No thinking twice
mark you Hed just kill you

I hope said Mr Lenox I shall never meet Mr Bateman in his
presence Suppose I were to fall against him accidentallyhow
perfectly ghastly

No fear of that said Mr Amos

Hes very well then said Mr Lenox we must get on Gregory We
have still that other address

Two pounds ten said Mr Amos

Oh no said Mr Lenox much too dear Come along Gregory

Ill tell you what Ill do said Mr Amos though it will be the end
of my friendship with Mr Bateman Ill say nothing about the collar
and chain and take two pounds

Too dear said Mr Lenox stepping to the taxi

Well how much will you give Mr Amos asked

Ill give you twentyfive shillings as he stands said Mr Lenox

Hes yours said Mr Amos

Mr Lenox immediately paid the money and then he went to a small
grocers near by and bought a bag of biscuits and with them he and
Gregory fed the famished Diogenes all the way back to Chiswick and by
the time they reached home he seemed so affectionate with them as never
to have had another master

Diogenes had come of course to stay but the horse was merely to be
hired To hire a carriagehorse or a ridinghorse is easy enough but a
carthorse as strong as a steamengine is more difficult to find

Mr Lenox decided to advertise and he therefore sent the following
advertisement to the _Daily Telegram_

WantedTo hire for a month at least an exceedingly powerful gentle
white horse to draw a caravan Reply by letter L The Gables
Chiswick

There said Mr Lenox as he read it out thats as clear as
crystal No one can misunderstand that

But as a matter of fact people will misunderstand anything for on
the day the advertisement appeared quite a number of men called at The
Gables all leading horses of every size and colour Kink was kept
busy in getting rid of them but one man succeeded in finding Robert
unattended and did all he could to persuade him that a pair of small
skewbald ponies such as he had brought with him would be far more
useful in a caravan than one large carthorse

Run in and tell your father that old sport said he Tell him Ive
got a pair of skews here as will do him credit and he shall have the
two for twenty pounds

No no said Robert theyre no use at all We advertised for one
large strong white horse

Mr Crawley was coming away from the house at this moment and the man
tackled him

Have the pair mister said the man Theyre wonderful
togetherdraw a pantechnicon Theres lots of white on them too Your
little boy here has taken such a fancy to them he added Eighteen
pound for the two

Another man who brought a black horse and said that white horses
always had a defect somewhere fastened on Miss Bingham

This is what you want mum he said Honest black Never trust a
white horse he said Blacks the colour Look at this mare
hereshes a beauty Strong as an elephant and docile as a tortoise
Fifteen quid mum and a bargain

My good man said Miss Bingham you are laboring under a
misapprehension I require no horse

Fortunately among the letters were several that told of exactly the
kind of horse that was needed and one afternoon a stable boy led into
the yard a perfectly enormous creature which Mr Lenox had hired for a
pound a week from a man at Finchley

Warranted sound in wind and limb said Mr Lenox and his name is
Moses

Gregory having given Moses a lump of sugar declined ever again to
wish for a motor caravan especially as Mr Scott slipped into his hand
that evening a large knife containing eight useful articles including
a hook for extracting stones from horses feet



CHAPTER 6

THE PLANS

The question where to go came next and compared with this all the
other preparations had been simple Here they were with a caravan and
a horse and a driver and a dog and maps and a mapmeasurer do you
know what theyre calledtheyre called wealemafnas and tents
andmost of allpermission to be entirely alone and it was not yet
decided where they were going

Of course as you may suppose each of the party knew where he or she
wanted to go but that was merely a private matter no general decision
had been come to

Mr Crawley who may be said to have lived for golf suggested Ashdown
Forest and then he said he could look them up from time to time if
they made a permanent camp there But who wants to be looked up by a
tutor when one is on a caravan holiday

Miss Bingham was in favour of an itinerary as she called it that
embraced two or three cathedral cities

Mr Lenox said Go to Sussex and camp under the downs at night and
explore them by day

Mr Scott on the other hand said Go to Berkshire and see the White
Horse that Tom Hughes scoured and wrote about And he promised to lend
them the book to convert them to this project

Mrs Avory declined to express any opinion Its your caravan she
said and I would much rather you decided everything for yourselves
What a delightful mother

Janet wanted to go to the New Forest because she had never been there
and now was a chance and because for many years The Children of the
New Forest had been her favourite story

Robert wanted to go to Salisbury Plain and see the sun rise at
Stonehenge and cast an eye over the military operations there

Jack Rotheram wanted to go to Hambledon in Hampshire to see the
cradle of cricket as it is calledthe old ground on Broad Halfpenny
Down where they used to play cricket in tall hats as described in John
Nyrens book which someone had given him

Mary Rotheram wanted to go to Bredon Hill in Worcestershire because
she had always wanted to ever since she had learned a song which began

 In summertime on Bredon
 The bells they sound so clear
 Round both the shires they ring them
 In steeples far and near
 A happy noise to hear

 Here of a Sunday morning
 My love and I would lie
 And see the coloured counties
 And hear the larks so high
 About us in the sky

That line about the coloured counties had always fascinated her she
had longed also to see them lying beneath her all spread out The
coloured counties She talked so enthusiastically and prettily about it
that she quite won over Robert who decided that Bredon would be quite
as interesting as Salisbury Plain and would give him practice too in
estimating square miles so that there were two for Bredon Hill as
against one for all the other places

Gregory however was not for Bredon He wanted to see the
flyingground at Sheppey which is in a totally different direction
and perhaps induce someone with an aeroplane to give him a lift

Horace Campbell sided with Gregory while Hester voted continually and
feelingly for StratfordonAvon To see StratfordonAvonthat was her
idea to walk through the same streets as her beloved Shakespeare to
see the place where his house had stood to row on his river to stand
by his tomb

When the time came to discuss the journey seriously it was Hester who
won StratfordonAvon was decided on with an extension to Bredon Hill
as the farthest point away returning by way of Cheltenham and
Cirencester to Faringdon for the White Horse and then taking train
for home and leaving Kink and Moses to do the remaining seventy miles
alone

The distance from Bredon to Faringdon through Cheltenham Cirencester
and Fairford was roughly fortyfive miles or five days of nine miles
each Starting at Oxford as was proposed they would be three or four
days in getting to Stratford and two days there three days more at
the most in getting to Bredon This would make eleven days altogether
which would make with rests on the two Sundays and one whole day at
the White Horse the full fortnight

This then is what was at last decided that Kink should get the
caravan to Oxford and be all ready for the children to join him on the
Wednesday morning They should go down to Oxford on the day before and
be looked after by Mr Lenoxs young brother who was at Oriel

They should leave Oxford in the caravan on the next morning on their
way to StratfordonAvon

The distance from Oxford to Stratford was thirtynine miles and it was
decided to do this in three days which meant thirteen miles a day The
first night therefore would be spent near Woodstock the next near
Chipping Norton and the third near Shipston down in the green meadows
on the banks of the Stour At Stratford they would find Mrs Avory
waiting for them and stay with her at the Shakespeare Hotel for a day
or so By that time they would know exactly how much or how little they
liked the caravan and what things were necessary and then Mrs Avory
would go back and they would begin their real adventures Could
anything be better Although of course Robert was very contemptuous
of the Shakespeare Hotel part of the programme The idea of sleeping
in a bed he said

The next thing to do was to apportion the various duties Kink of
course was arranged for he was to drive and to look after the horse
and sleep as near the caravan as could be managed while Diogenes was
always to be on guard Kink also was to see about water

Janet was purser and steward She had to decide what food was wanted
and to keep the money Hester was the official letterwriter and was
under a promise to write home every other evening Robert was the guide
and geographer he kept the maps He was also the telegraphist Mary
Rotheram who had taken lessons in cooking was chief cook and she was
to be helped by Janet Jack was superintendent of the washingup and
Horace Campbell was his principal ally How tired they got of it
Jack Horace and Robert were carriers between the grocers the
butchers the bakers and the Slowcoach

It was arranged that Gregory being the smallest and weakest and
therefore the least likely to be refused should go on and ask leave of
the farmers on whose land it was proposed to rest the caravan at night
Mary Rotheram should be his companion and ask for eggs and milk at the
same time

Next came the victualling and this was exceedingly interesting
although it made great holes in the sovereign box Janet and Mary
Rotheram sat for hours over the Stores List and they were continually
taking important questions to Collins

How many tins of mustard ought we to take A dozen at fourpence

Mustard Miss Mary Why two penny ones would be enough for a month

Three and tenpence saved you see

I say Collins how long do eggs boil

Collins you have to prick sausages dont you or else they burst

Collins how many loaves do eight people want a day

Four Miss Janet at the leastlarge ones

Including Kink Janet explained

Oh Kink too Five then if not six the old gormandizer

Collins whats the best part of beef for stewing

Collins you can put anything into a stew cant you Absolutely
anything

Collins if youve put too much pepper into a thing is there any way
of getting it out again

Mrs Avory was very particular about tinned things You must have
plenty of tongues she said in case the fire wont burn or the meat
is too tough and privately she instructed Kink to keep an eye on
their eating They must eat Kink dont forget Never mind what they
say make them eat sensibly To the stores Mrs Avory herself added a
number of tongues and a good deal of plain chocolate

The day for Kinks departureat least three days before the others
were to leaveat last arrived and by eleven oclock everything was
ready Kink was seated on the shafts with the reins in one hand and
in the other an ancient map of the road from London to Oxford which
Robert had found in one of his fathers Road Books of which there were
many in the library and had carefully traced It was called _Britannia
Depicta_ OR _Ogilby Improved_ 1753 and so that you may see what
kind of help Kink was offered I have had the map reproduced here
Kink I may say having some difficulty in reading even the plain print
of the morning paper held the tracing in his hand only so far as he
was in sight He then folded it up and placed it in his pocket and
when he was in any doubt as to the way asked the first person he met

Mr Lenox and Mr Scott were both there in time to see the start of the
Slowcoach as they had decided to call it Also present at the start
was the greater part of adult Chiswick and all its children who filled
the street opposite The Gables and cheered Kink accepted their
enthusiasm with calm but as he said afterwards to Collins I felt
like the Prince of Wales and all the royal family

Both Mr Scott and Mr Lenox brought contributions to the Slowcoachs
stores Mr Scotts was a large bundle of firelighters and twelve dozen
boxes of matches You cant have too many matches he said Mr
Lenoxs was ointment for blisters

Uncle Christopher was also there to see the start and he brought with
him an envelope This envelope he said is not to be opened unless
youre in any very serious difficulty Then open it

And so in a scene of wild excitement Kink cracked his whip Moses
strained at the collar the Slowcoach creaked heavily out of the yard
and its historic journey was begun



CHAPTER 7

MR LENOXS YOUNG BROTHER

Mr Lenoxs young brother met the party on the Oxford platform He was
accompanied by two of his friends who were dressed in grey flannels
and straw hats and were smoking very large and beautiful pipes Mr
Lenoxs young brother introduced these friends as Fizzy and Shrimp and
then they packed themselves into three hansoms and drove off

Mr Lenoxs young brother led the way with Janet and Mary Fizzy at
least Hester thought it was Fizzy but it may have been Shrimp came
next with Hester Horace and Gregory and then came Shrimp unless it
was Fizzy with Robert and Jack

Oxford hansoms are the worst in the world but seldom has a ride been
more delightful The three hosts pointed out the colleges as they
passed until they came far too soon to the Mitre where they were to
sleep

Now take your things upstairs and make sure where your rooms are and
tidy up if you want to said Mr Lenoxs young brother and then hop
down and well take you to see the caravan and show you about a
little and perhaps go on the river and in the evening were going to
have supper in my rooms Fizzys going to conjure and perhaps well
have charades

These words made tidying up an even simpler matter than usual and the
party started off

Kink it seems had reached Oxford that morning and was at the Green
Man where the Slowcoach was an object of extraordinary interest to the
neighbourhood They found him seated on the top step reading the paper
while fortyfive children at least stared at him Diogenes lay at the
foot of the steps

Kink was very glad to see them No he said he hadnt had any
adventures exactly but driving a caravan was no work for a modest man
who wished for a quiet life among vegetables

This he said waving his pipe at the increasing crowd is nothing
You should have see them at Beaconsfield and High Wycombe They began
by thinking I was Lord John Sanger and when they were satisfied that I
wasnt they made sure I was a Cheap Jack with gold watches for a
shilling each

How does it go Kink Robert asked

It goes all right said Kink but the crockery wants muffling You
cant hear yourself think when you trot

And Diogenes

Diogenes said Kink is a masterpiece He begins to growl at tramps
when theyre half a mile away Why is it I wonder Kink added that
dogs cant abide ragged clothes This Oxford they tell me is a clever
place I wonder if anyone here can explain that

Mr Lenoxs young brother and his friends had now to be shown the
Slowcoach which they pronounced top hole and then Moses was
inspected in his stable and this being done they were ready for the
riveror rather for the ices at a pastrycooks shop in the High
Streetcalled the Highwhich were to precede the river

Then they all trooped down to the boats and had a perfect hours
rowing and then they explored Oxford a little and saw Tom Quad at
Christ Church or The House as it is called and were shown the
rooms in which the author of Alice in Wonderland lived for so many
years and so right up through the city to Magdalen Grove where the
deer live and Magdalen Tower on the top of which the May Day carols
are sung

Mr Lenoxs young brother lived in rooms outside his college he would
not enter the college until next term They were in Oriel Lane and
exceedingly comfortable with at least twenty pipes in a piperack on
the wall and at least thirty photographs of his favourite actresses
chiefly Pauline Chase and five cricketbats in the corner and about
forty walkingsticks and a large number of puzzles of the Pigs in
Clover type which nearly drove Gregory mad while supper was being
prepared

The preparation consisted merely of the entrance of one man after
another carrying silver dishes for everything was cold although
exceedingly sumptuous and solid There were chickens all covered with a
beautiful thick whitewash on which little hearts and stars cut out of
truffles were sprinkled There was a tongue all over varnish like the
dainty foot of a giant Cinderella There were custards and tarts and
jellies There were also bottles exactly like champagne bottles which
however contained ginger ale and for Mr Lenoxs young brother and
his friends there were silver tankards of beer It was in short not a
supper but as Mary Rotheram expressed it using her favourite
adjective at the moment a supreme banquet

Then another friend with spectacles called the Snarker came in and
they began Mr Lenoxs young brother was a very attentive host and
made everyone eat too much Then he made a speech to propose the health
of the Slowcoaches as he called them and to wish them a prosperous
journey That you will all be happy he said very gravely in
conclusion is our earnest wish But the one thing which my friends
and I desire more than any otherand I assure you that they are with
me most cordially in this sentiment arent you Fizzy arent you
Shrimp arent you Snarkerthe one thing that we desire more than
any other is that you may never be run in for exceeding the speed
limit This was a very successful joke

After supper came Fizzys conjuring tricks which were not very
bewildering to children who had once had a real conjurer from the
Stores as these had and then a charade played by Mary Horace Fizzy
and Shrimp for the others to guess

The first act represented a motorist Fizzy who ran over and killed an
old woman Mary and was arrested by a policeman Horace and fined
eighteenpence by a magistrate Shrimp

The second was a cockney scene in which two costers Fizzy and Shrimp
took their girls Mary and Horace to Hampstead Heath to ave fun

The third was Henry VIII Shrimp receiving Anne of Cleves Fizzy and
her Maid of Honour Mary and telling Wolsey Horace to prepare the
divorce because she was a great Flanders mare

You see the whole word of courseCaraveAnne

Finally the Snarker said that they must play one writing game before
they went home The Snarker it seemed came from a family which was
devoted to writing games and had even made improvements in
Consequences which is when you all know each other extremely well
the best writing game of all But among strangers as the Snarker
explained it was not so good because they cant understand the jokes
against uncles and aunts

They did not therefore play Consequences but instead wrote what
the Snarker called composite stories That is to say they each took
a large sheet of paper and began at the top a story writing as much as
they could in two minutes Then the paper was passed on and the story
continued by the next person until all had had one turn Then the
original beginners each finished his story and they were read out

As there were eleven playing this meant there were eleven stories but
I will copy only one of them Janet kept the papers or I should not
be able to do that

This is the one which was begun by Hester who liked to be serious and
mysterious in her work and was almost vexed when others turned it to
nonsense She called it The Secret of the Castle and began it like
this

It was a dark and gloomy night in the year 1135 when the young Lord
Almeric reached his impressive and ancestral home Nothing could be
heard but the sighing of the wind in the turrets and the moaning of
Boris the great wolfhound Lord Almeric had ridden far and was tired
and the gloominess of his ancestral home weighed on his spirits which
were naturally buoyant and high Flinging himself from his gaily
comparisoned horse and tossing the rein with a muttered Here
varlet to the waiting groom he opened the massive doors and entered
the hall What was his amazement to see

Time called the Snarker who had his watch before him and Hester
had to stop

Gregory came next His idea of the game was not very clear to begin
with and he had some difficulty in reading what was written so he was
able to write very little and that not too helpfully He therefore
wrote words that were always near his heart

 a flyingmachine

and that was all

Then came Janet Always wishing to be kind and make things easy she
longed to get the story back into the spirit and period of poor little
romantic Hesters opening passages But Gregory had spoiled everything
Janet however did her best

The young lord drew back with a start for he could hardly believe his
eyes

What he exclaimed is this strange mixture of wires and wings Can
my fathers astrologer have really done it at last after all these
fruitless years He must indeed have been busy since I rode forth to
battle Eftsoons do I dream or wake He touched the strange thing
cautiously but it did not bite and gradually there came upon him an
exceeding desire to fly By my halidom he cried I will een
inquire further into this mystery

Next came Fizzy who was bent on being funny at any cost He wrote

as the man said sticking his fork into the German sausage What
ho my merry minions help he cried let us draw forth the areoplane
into the home meadow for I would fain experiment with it A lord is no
lord unless he can daunt the swallow and the pigeon So saying he rang
the alarmbell which was only kept for fires and burglaries and
summoned the household A murrain on ye for being so pestilent slow
he shouted Gadsooth ye knaves let loose the petrol or I soar not
into the zenith

Then came Mary who naturally had no patience with nonsense She
ignored Fizzys contribution completely and got back to romance

Meanwhile seated in her room in the home turret sat the lovely Lady
Elfrida the picture of woe Why did her lord tarry Had she not heard
him ride into the courtyard and give his palfrey to the waiting serf
Yet where was he He was to spring up the stairs lightly as a roebuck
of the mountains to welcome her and now where was he Little did she
guess

Here Shrimp took the paper and wrote

that a brandnew monoplane was blocking up the stairs so big that
not a roebuck on earth could jump it But what of the secret of the
castle Was that the secret No Why did the wind shriek and the
deerhound moan If you would know this reader come with me down the
dungeon steps and unbar yonder dark door For there in the dark recess
of that terrible cell lay

The Shrimp even although time had not been called was very glad to
leave off here Robert took the paper He read the narrative as well as
he could and added these words

But I cannot bring my pen to write the word It was a secret indeed
the secret of the castle No wonder that the dog moaned and the wind
howled and the Lady Elfrida grieved

The Snarker who after all had begun the wretched game and whose
duty it was therefore to pull this ruin of a story together again
ought to have played fair but instead he went back to what Fizzy had
called an areoplane spelling not being taught at Oxford He
therefore wrote

And meanwhile what of the aeroplane Fortunately the night was
short and there was soon enough light by which to fly and in a brief
time the seneschals and myrmidons had the great machine in the midst of
the tourneyground all ready for flight Lord Almeric seated himself
and grasped the lever A firm push from the willing arms of a hundred
carles and hinds and he was in the air Ah he cried odds bodkins
this is indeed life Never have I felt such sensations I will never
walk or ride again I will sell my motorcar and my horses and my boots
Flying is for me for ever

Jack now took the paper

Lord Almeric was always a very clever man and it was nothing to him
that he had never flown before He had studied the pictures of the
flying men in the illustrated papers while waiting at the dentists
and he knew the principles of mechanics No wonder then that he flew
with perfect control circling the home turret where the Lady Elfrida
was still weeping with the greatest ease and calling to her messages
of comfort which

Here the Snarker called Time again and Mr Lenoxs young brother
took the paper

she could not hear Come down good lord or of a verity thou wilt
fall and crack thy coxcomb shouted the majordomo from beneath but
the intrepid Almeric heeded not the warning and only rose higher and
higher nearer and nearer to the stars And then suddenly there was
an awful shriek and his body was seen to be hurtling steadily and
surely towards the earth gaining speed with every revolution Help
help they cried he must be dashed to pieces nothing can save him
But at that moment

Here Horace had to go on He was not a literary boy and it took him
more than one minute to read all that had gone before All he could
therefore add was

he woke up Where am I he said You have fallen out of bed
said Lady Elfrida

Poor Hester her face was a picture of perplexity and indignation when
she came to read the story all through There was clearly no sensible
ending possible and she therefore merely wrote

Not to this day has the secret of the Castle been solved but visitors
are still shown on payment of a shilling each the place where Lord
Almeric dreamed he fell from a flyingmachine in the year 1135

And then Mr Lenoxs young brother and his friends took them back to
the Mitre and said goodnight



CHAPTER 8

THE FIRST DAY

Mr Lenoxs young brother gave them a tremendous breakfast and called
in Fizzy and Shrimp and the Snarker to help and then Janet paid the
bill at the Mitre and bought a few things including two cold chickens
and they all went down to the little inn yard together and found Kink
waiting for them

Janet whose duties as paymaster had now begun in earnest also paid
Kinks bill Robert set his pedometer at zero and the whole party
started followed by the crowd of idle men and children to which they
were destined to become so accustomed For a caravan with people in it
who are not gipsies is still an excitement in England

Kink drove and the others walked behind or by the side or in
frontmostly in front for it was soon discovered that Moses had a
slower walk than any other of the partyin fact two miles an hour was
more than his rate although Kink assured them that he could trot from
four to five on the level and keep it up

It was a fine but rather windy day and the dust flew about a little
too much but everything was too fresh and exciting for that to matter
What is a little dust on the first day of a caravan expedition

Mr Lenoxs young brother and his jolly friends turned back at
Wolvercot as there was work to do even at Oxford It was not until
their last waving handkerchiefs were out of sight that the children
really felt themselves at the start of their adventurous enterprise In
fact Robert put the feeling into words Now were beginning he said

Up to this time all had walked but glancing at Gregorys lagging
legs Janet soon began to assume the little mother once again In
consultation with Kink it was decided that on fairly level roads Moses
was equal to the Slowcoach plus four passengers and it was therefore
agreed that there should never be more than that number riding at once
but in order that no one should be too tired they should take it in
turns to enjoy these short periods of ease

The arrangement made it necessary to appoint a new officer who was
called the Regulator of Rests and Mary Rotheram was chosen Her duties
were not quite as simple as they sound because Gregory the youngest
and Hester being not very much older and not very strong were to have
more rides than anyone else Kink also must be allowed to ride a good
deal And this meant a little calculation but Mary was always good at
arithmetic

Gregory of course refused point blank to ride a single yard but he
was rarely sorry none the less when the time came to climb the steps
and settle down in a chair

They had lunch that first day near Yarnton without making any camp or
cooking anything The cooking was to be saved for the evening They
merely tore the two cold chickens to pieces and ate them with
breadandbutter and stone ginger beer from an inn beside the road It
is much the best way with a cold chicken Afterwards bananas which
someone had told Mrs Avory were the most sustaining of fruit

Robert had arranged an easy day to begin with and they were to go no
farther than Woodstock where for those not too tired there was
Blenheim to see the wonderful house of the Duke of Marlborough and
Fair Rosamonds Bower and the park and the lake Hester even had hopes
of finding a distressed Blenheim spaniel puppy in some romantic sort of
way and adopting it for life

But there were none of these things for them Indeed caravaners very
soon get out of the habit of making plans at all It is all too
uncertain The only things that really are certain are work and delay
They got no nearer to Blenheim than to peer through its gates and to
recite very imperfectly the verses about old Caspars work and little
Wilhelmine

At about halfpast three they entered Woodstock and after passing
through the village and doing a little shopping there surrounded by
all Woodstocks children who were not in school they began to look
about for a campingplace And this needs more thought than one might
suppose for there must be some shelter from the wind and water must
not be too distant Also one does not want to be very close to a busy
and dusty road

Kink who had gone off on a little tour of inspection came back at
last and said he had found an excellent field high and dry and
sheltered too Stopping a labourer they found that the farmer was Mr
Gosden of Blacketts and Gregory and Mary Rotheram hurried off to the
farmhouse which was a few fields off to ask permission and get some
milk and perhaps eggs and butter

They found the door of the kitchen open but no one there It was a
large low kitchen with a very red brick floor and it led into the
dairy where they could see the flat pans of milk The fire was burning
so brightly that they knew the farmers wife could not be far away
Over the mantelpiece was a gun Two or three highly polished and highly
coloured grocers calendarspictures of beautiful womenwere on the
walls Sides of bacon hung from the ceiling The whole place smelled of
wood smoke and plenty The children noticed all these things as they
stood in the doorway every now and then knocking

At last they heard steps and a very wide and smiling woman entered the
kitchen from another door

Well she asked what can I do for you

Gregory proud to be really beginning his duties said Please may we
camp tonight in one of your fields Were living in a caravan

Youve come to the wrong person said Mrs Gosden Thats my
husbands affair and hes rather particular Hes gone to Chipping
Norton but she added as Gregory began to look miserable hell be
back any minute now You sit down and have a cup of tea with me and
wait for him

So they sat down and Mrs Gosden made the tea which she took from a
highly coloured tin covered also with beautiful women and they had
with it bread and butter and lettuce and talked

And how do you like gipsying Mrs Gosden asked

I think its going to be splendid Mary said but weve only just
begun

Then you havent slept out before

No said Mary

My word said Mrs Gosden what sore throats youll have in the
morning Roughing its all very well by day but give me a comfortable
bed to lay in of a night Thats me

At this moment the sound of wheels was heard and Mrs Gosden jumped up
and added some hot water to the tea and cut some more breadandbutter
Thats father she said and Mr Gosden soon after came in

He was a big man with whiskers under his chin all the way round but
none on the rest of his face

Hello he said visitors

Yes said Mrs Gosden a young lady and gentleman who are living in
a caravan and want to camp in the hay takers At least I think its
the hay takers from what they say of it

Ho do they said Mr Gosden A nice state of things he added with
a twinkle when every one who comes to ask leave to spoil one of my
fields gets a nice tea given them and he laughed

We shouldnt spoil it said Gregory

Well said Mr Gosden perhaps youll tell me how you make a fire
Isnt it on the ground And what do you do with your rubbish Clean it
up and take it along with you Not too likely Ive had caravaners here
before

We will said Mary I promiseseeing as she spoke the necessity of
a new official being appointed at once the Remover of Camp Litter

I said the other day continued the farmer that never again would I
let a caravan into my fields didnt I Bet And how can I go back on
that

You did say it said Mrs Gosden true enough but youre halways
breaking your word You said youd bring me a new alarm clock the next
time you went to Oxford and Ive never got it yet and thats months
ago

Never mind said Mr Gosden it means longer in bed for you Well
he added to Mary Ill come down with you and look at the turnout and
see But I must finish my tea first

Never thought Mary could anyone have eaten so much tea or taken so
long over it and she was in despair about the others waiting in the
road hungry and impatient but there was nothing for it but to be
quiet and at last Mr Gosden was ready

The others it was true had become very tired of waiting but they had
spent some of the time in bringing water from the nearest cottage No
one who gets really cross from waiting should ever go away in a
caravan Mr Gosden had a good look at all of them and at Kink before
he said anything He then gave them leave to camp very near the hedge
and he asked them to promise to be gone by ten the next morning as he
had some cattle coming in and to clear up thoroughly and then off he
went He stepped back to tell them to come up to the farm in the
morning for milk and butter and to report on their night and started
off once more

Gregory who had clearly been puzzling over something ran after him

Well said Mr Gosden

Where do they take the hay Gregory said

Who Mr Gosden asked

The hay takers said Gregory

I dont understand said Mr Gosden

What hay takers Its not a hay meadow We graze it

Mrs Gosden said Gregory called the field the hay takers

Mr Gosden laughed loudly Thats my mississ pronounciation he
said Shes much too fond of haitches she will put them in the wrong
place I often correct her but its no use Its nothing to do with
hay Its the size of the fieldthe size dont you see The eight
acres thats what she meant to say bless her old heart



CHAPTER 9

THE FIRST NIGHT

Well said Janet thats a very nice start It would have been
horrid if the first farmer had been crusty

Ah said Mary Rotheram but you should see his wife It was she who
did it for us really Perhaps after dinner we might walk up there to
thank her

After dinner How recklessly young caravaners can talk But you shall
hear

Kink with much skill got Moses and the Slowcoach into the field and
shut the gate and then the great carriage rocked and swayed over the
grass making no sound but a mixture of creaking and crockery At last
he brought it to a stand just under a tall hedge and Moses was at once
taken out and roped to a crowbar driven in the ground

The first thing said Janet is the fire and Jack and Horace were
sent off to collect wood and pile it near the Slowcoach and fix the
tripod over it As it was quite dry one of Mr Scotts lighters soon
had it blazing and Mary as chief cook threw quickly into the water
in the pot the large piece of brisket they had bought at Woodstock
together with potatoes and carrots and little onions and pepper and
salt

That done and leaving Horace with strict orders to keep the fire fed
the others began to unpack First of all mackintosh sheets and rugs
were thrown on the ground round the fire and then Robert and Jack drew
out their tent and set it up on the farther side of the fire some four
or five yards away so that the fire was midway between the tent and
the caravan

The tent was similar to those which gipsies usenot with a central
pole but stretched over halfhoops which were stuck in the ground It
was wide enough for three boys to lie comfortably in their
sleepingbags side by side Gregory was to sleep in the caravan with
the girls Kink was to go to Woodstock

Meanwhile with all of them except Mary and Gregory who had done well
with Mrs Gosdens tea the pangs of hunger were at work and the steam
of the great iron pot hanging over the fire did nothing to allay them
Mary and Janet every now and then thrust a fork into the meat but its
resistance to the point was heartbreaking

Hadnt you better have some biscuits to go on with Janet said at
last but the others refused It would spoil the stew they thought

At any rate Janet said lets get everything ready not only for
supperyou see it wasnt called dinner any longerbut for
washingup afterwards

So Kink went off for some more water and a large basin was set on a
box and dishcloths were put by it and a rackety search began for
plates and knives and forks and mugs and tinned fruits and more
plates and spoons and moist sugar and all the other things which
appear on our tables at mealtimes as naturally as leaves on the trees
but which in a caravan mean so much fuss and perplexity In fact all
the children returned home with a vastly increased respect for the
ability and punctuality of Collins and Eliza Pollard and Jan Masters

For a while the air was simply full of questions and remarks some of
which I copy down and you may guess who asked them

I say Janet wheres the tinopener

Janet dear ought we to have napkins

Hester you little nuisance get off that box its got the bread in
it

Hester stop reading and come and help

Horace the fires nearly out

I wish some of you would stop talking and tell me where the tinopener
is

Jack you lazy ruffian why dont you get some more sticks

I say Kink do you think this old brisket will ever be done

Kink does it ruin potatoes and things to stew too long

Kink is there any decent way of opening a tin without a tinopener

Im perfectly certain the sugar was in this cupboard Gregory have
you been at the sugar

Its a good deal harder than a rock still

Can you make a tinopener out of a fork

I am perfectly certain I saw the corkscrew this morning

Oh I say I didnt come out in this old caravan to die of hunger and
neglect

Mary where did you put the milkjug

Lets have that beast of a brisket out and cut him up and put him in
again in smaller pieces

Oh Jack how clever you are However did you think of that

I expect its hunger sharpening his wits

I say its all very well to say cut him up small but hes red hot
Im scalded horribly

So am I

Yes and so am I the way you make him jump about It splashed right
over here

Kink come and help us hold the brisket down while we cut him up

The result of all this confusion was the appointment of two or three
new officials Horace was made Keeper of the Tinopener and Gregory
Keeper of the Cork screw while Jack was given the title of Preserver
of Enough Oil in the Beatrice Stove because you can do wonders with a
Beatrice stove while waiting for the real fire to burn upbut only if
theres oil in it

Jacks brilliant device of slicing the brisket was successful and by
halfpast seven they were seated on their rugs round the fire eating
the most supreme stew of the century as Mary Rotheram called it They
ate it in soupplates with a great deal of juice into which they
dropped their bread

Suddenly old Kink who had been eating steadily for a quarter of an
hour just outside the circle stepped up to what we may call the
suppertable with his watch in his hand

Miss Janet he said theres only a quarter of an hour to get to
Woodstock to send off the telegram

Janet looked at the official telegraphist in alarm Oh Bobbie she
said how dreadful if we had missed it You must simply run

Robert sprang to his feet in a moment

Give me a shilling he said Ill make it up as I go along Keep
some tinned pears for me

Ill come too said Jack and off they bolted

They reached the postoffice just in time to despatch this message

Avory Gables Chiswick just finished glorious brisket all well love

On their return Robert and Jack found washingup in full swing and
were not sorry to be able to eat their pears in comfort and watch the
others being busy

The light was now going fast the bats flitted over their heads and
there was no sound save the talking and clattering of the washersup
and the grinding of Diogeness teeth on the brisket bone Various
projects for spending the last hours of the day had been talked of but
now that it was here no one seemed to have the slightest energy left
either to walk into Blenheim Park or cross the three or four fields to
Blacketts In fact they wanted but one thing and that was to creep
into their very novel beds and see what it was like to sleep like
gipsies

Everything was therefore put ready for breakfast A last load of wood
was brought for the fire Diogenes was transferred to the long rope
which enabled him to range all round the camp and Kink said good night
and trudged off to the village inn

And so the first night began

Gregory was a little fractious for a while considering it an indignity
to be sleeping in the caravan instead of with the men but he was no
sooner tucked into his berth than he fell asleep and forgot the insult
The girls were also very soon on their little shelves either sleeping
or drowsily enjoying the thought of sleep but Robert and Jack and
Horace did not hurry The fire was still warm and they huddled round
it with Diogenes and talked and listened to Moses crunching the
grass and made plans for the morrow Then at last they carried the
sheeting and the rugs to the tent and crept into their sacks and
prepared to sleep

With the exception of Gregory no one slept very well Hester was
frightened by an owl which hooted close to the caravan and Janet had
to hold her hand for quite a long time which is a very uncomfortable
thing to do when you are in the berth below and then just as she was
going off again a rabbit pursued by a stoat screamed right under
their wheels as it seemed and Hesters fright began anew

Jack and Horace were probably a little over excited for they were very
restless and to be restless on the hard groundwith no springs as in
our beds at homeis to get sore and wakeful while Robert was intently
conscious of every sound and if you sleep in a field you hear thousands
of themall the rustlings of the little shy nocturnal animals tiny
squeakings and shrillings in the grass as well as the cries of the
birds of prey Now and then too a spider ran over his face and made
him jump and very early the strong light poured into the mouth of the
tent and made it seem absurd to be in bed any longer

The result was that it was not till the morning that they began to
sleep properly at all and that made them much less ready to get up
than they had expected to be



CHAPTER 10

THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND CARAVAN

The arrival of Kink at halfpast six was a great relief Robert hailed
him and Kink said it was a beautiful morning

Dont you get up yet he said after Robert and Janet had both told
him of the night Ill make the fire and boil the kettle and fetch
water and so on and you get up when I tell you Otherwise youll all
be too tired and get ill

And so they had the blessed experience of lying still and drowsy and
hearing Kink move about for their comfort

The boys were up first and made extremely noisy toilets in the
washingup basin and then Jack and Gregory went off to the farm for
milk and butter and eggs and Mrs Gosden who seemed early as it was
to be in the very middle of a days work and who refused to believe
that the boys were not deceiving her when they denied having sore
throats gave them leave to gather strawberries so that their return
to the Slowcoach was a new triumph

Their breakfast was chiefly scrambled eggs ham and strawberries and
by ten oclock true to their bargain they were out of the field and
on the highroad and no sign of their camp remained save a black
circle caused by the fire and a slight crushing of the grass all round
it

They had gone a very little way before Robert who had already been to
Woodstock with the morning telegram began to realize that he was in
for a blister on his left heel and on asking the others he found
that they were not too comfortable either

This means he told Mary speaking to her in her official capacity of
Regulator of Rests that we shall have to ride a good deal because we
simply must go twelve miles today or we shant be at Stratford in time
for mother tomorrow afternoon

Mary therefore ordered them in and out of the Slowcoach with great
frequency but it was not a great deal of use for they hobbled more
and more

At Enstone they stopped for lunch which consisted of a tongue and
bananas and ginger beer and here they met a friendly tinker drinking
his ale outside the inn who noticing their lameness gave them some
good advice If you cant stop and rest he said you should soap
your stockings and its a good thing now and then to change the
stockings from left to right They found that the soap was really
useful and got on much better and a little later they were overtaken
by two young men on a walking tour who slowed down to fall into step
for a while with Robert and Jack One gave them some hints When you
are very tired he said it helps to hold something in front of you
at full lengtheven a walking stick will do or a coat rolled up It
pulls you along You look like an idiot of course but that doesnt
matter No one who minds looking foolish will ever have a really good
time It is a good thing to prevent a stitch in your side to carry a
little pebble in your mouth Squeezing a cork in each hand helps

Another way to make walking easier said the other young man is to
sing as you go All sing togethermarching songs if you know any
such as Tramp boys tramp Thats what soldiers do on long marches
and it makes all the difference

They didnt take the road to Chipping Norton but stopped at the town
while Kink who had no blisters went into the town to get the
evenings dinner and meanwhile Janet persuaded the Beatrice stove to
give them tea It was while here that they had their first experience
of Diogenes as a guardian for he frightened away two tramps who seemed
likely to be troublesome

On Kinks return Robert urged them on for he had marked down on his
map a spot called the Hollow about five miles farther on near Long
Compton which sounded exceedingly attractive as a campingground
especially to one who had read Lavengro and remembered the Dingle
there near Long Melton and hither very footsore but still brave and
happy they came about halfpast four and made a very snug camp in it
without asking anyones leave

It was not time for supper and they were very glad to lie about and be
lazy while the stew was slowly cooking Robert and Janet and Mary
consulted very deeply about the morrow and at last decided that it
would be best to remain there all the day and get their blisters cured
with Mr Lenoxs ointment and therefore a telegram would have to go to
Mrs Avory at once telling her not to go to Stratford till Saturday
and also Robert added to bring my bicycle We can easily fasten it
on the roof and its going to be frightfully necessary often and
often This evening for instance Here we are goodness knows how far
from a telegraphoffice and everyone lame except Kinky wholl have to
go

Kink however had luck for he met a bakers cart on its way to
Chipping Norton and the man not only said he would take the telegram
and the letter but he agreed to bring out a number of things to eat
the next day

Feeling rested and well fed they therefore went to bed that Thursday
night much more likely to sleep than on the night before

And indeed everyone did sleep well except once again Robert
Whatever the reason he was very wide awake and at some hour in the
middle of the night he crept out of his sack and walked into the open
away from the trees intent upon comparing the magnetic northwhich
his compass gave himwith the true north which anyone can find by
looking at the Great Bear sprawling across the skies and getting the
Pole Star from its pointers

Having marked the difference on the glass of his compass with a spot of
ink from his fountainpen Robert returned to the Hollow but to his
astonishment and alarm on reaching the caravan he could not find the
tent There was the Slowcoach right enough with its white blinds
glimmering and he could hear Moses munching close by but there was no
tent and apparently no Diogenes

Robert was not a timid boy but the lateness of the hour and the
loneliness of the place and this extraordinary occurrence affected his
nerves so that he suddenly had a panic and running up the steps he
beat on the caravandoor as if wolves were after him

Hullo hullo cried a gruff voice that certainly did not belong to
any of the girls What the dickens do you want

Robert nearly fell off the steps in his surprise Please he said I
want the Slowcoach

For answer the door opened and a big head and beard and a pyjama arm
were pushed out

Slowcoach the head said What Slowcoach Theres no Slowcoach here

The Slowcoach is the name of our caravan said Robert

Oh it is said the head Then its over there I saw it as I came
in This is the Snail

Thank you very much said Robert who had quite recovered his
composure How late are you going to stay here in the morning

I dont know said the head yawning vastly It depends on the
country I shant go till after breakfast anyhow But Im much too
tired to talk now Goodnight Slowcoach

Good night Snail said Robert

And that is how the Avories came to know the great Hamish MacAngus for
when Robert led them round to visit him the next morning And it is
right for us to call first said Janet since we have lived here
longer they found that the owner of the Snail was nothing less than
the famousBut I must tell you in the next chapter



CHAPTER 11

THE WAYSIDE FRIEND

Mr MacAngus had just finished his ham and eggs and was lighting his
pipe

Good morning Slowcoaches he said Im very pleased to see you Sit
down wherever you like Furniture by Dame Nature everything as nice as
Mother makes it This is a friendly reasonable hour to meet That
young brother of yoursI suppose he is your brotherpointing to
Robertpays calls in the middle of the night He seems to think every
caravan in the world belongs to him How a man who lives in a London
terrace knows his house I never could understand but to recognize
ones own caravan ought to be quite easy

Mr MacAngus you must understand did not say all this in one breath
for he was a slow man But it reads as if he did because none of the
others uttered a word It was all too bewildering and also too amusing
He was so big and so strange and he had such a twinkle in his eye
that they preferred to let him go on knowing that whatever he said
would be entertaining

Well he said at last now we must stop talking nonsense and
introduce ourselves But first I should like you all to guess who I am
and what I do for a living You first he said pointing to Janet

I think you are a kind of hermit she said at last

Right he said But thats not enough What do I do You he added
pointing to Mary what do you think I do

Perhaps you lecture said Mary or preach No I dont think you
preach I think very likely you speak to villagers about
politicstariff reform and things like that

The big man laughed Very well he said Now you to Robert

I think youre a gentleman gipsy said Robert Like Lavengro Are
you

In a way said the stranger but I shant tell you till youve all
guessed

Jack Rotheram then guessed that he was a spy and this amused him
immensely

In a kind of way I am that too he answered At any rate I am
always looking out for the fatness of the land

Hester guessed he had a broken heart because of a disappointment in
love and was living all alone because he hated the world like Lord
Byron

He liked this most of all and laughed for a long timemuch longer he
explained afterwards than a brokenhearted Lord Byron would have done

Horace Campbell did not exactly guess but said that he hoped that the
stranger was a gentleman burglara kind of Raffles and Robin Hood in
onewho robbed only the wicked rich and helped the poor As he
added I want to

Oh do you said the big man Well dont rob me anyway Wait till
I have led the Snail to a place of safety

And lastly Gregory guessed I think he said you are a vagabond

Gregory cried Janet you mustnt say things like that while the
stranger laughed again

Why not Gregory inquired I mean like the Wandering Jew Mr Crawley
told us about He called him the prince of vagabonds

Well said the stranger Gregorys right I am a vagabond But Im
something else too and Ill tell you Im an artist My name is Hamish
MacAngus I live in the Snail most of the summer and in London in the
winter I cover pieces of cardboard and canvas with paint more or less
like trees and cows and sheep and skies and people who have more
pennies than brains buy them from me and then I take the pennies and
change them for the nice sensible things of life such as bacon and
tobacco and oats My horses name is Pencil I came here from Banbury
and I am making slowly for Cropthorne Now tell me all about
yourselves Tell me in the order of age

The children looked at each other and laughed

You first said Mr MacAngus again to Janet youre the eldest I
can see

My name said Janet is Janet Avory I live in Chiswick Our caravan
is the Slowcoach We are going to StratfordonAvon Our horse is
called Moses Our

Oh Janet said Hester youre not leaving anything for us to tell

Very well said Janet thats all

My name said Mary is Mary Rotheram I am the daughter of a doctor
at Chiswick My brother and I are the Avories guests I am fourteen
Father has one of your pictures

Good judge Mr MacAngus said

Now Macbeth he said pointing to Robert

My name isnt Macbeth said Robert

No said the artist but thats how I think of you Why Can anyone
tell me

I can said Hester Because he woke you upMacbeth hath murdered
sleep

Splendid said Mr MacAngus As a reward you shall tell your story
before Macbeth does

I am nine said Hester My name is Hester I adore Shakespeare I am
Janets sister

Good said Mr MacAngus We will read Shakespeare together this
afternoon From the way you walk I can see that this is blister day We
will all take it easy and be happy and you shall cure your lameness
Now Mac

I am thirteen said Robert I am the geographer of the party I am
sorry for murdering your sleep but glad too because youre so jolly

Now you said Mr MacAngus to Jack Rotheram

I am not an Avory said Jack I am Marys brother I am twelve I am
going to Osborne next year

Very sensible of you said Mr MacAngus And you sir he added to
Horace Campbell the burglars friend

My name is Horace Campbell he replied I am the son of the Vicar of
Chiswick I am nine I am also the Keeper of the Tinopener

Oh yes said Jack I forgot that I am the Preserver of Enough Oil
in the Beatrice Stove

I am proud to meet such important personages said Mr MacAngus And
now lastly youhe said to Gregorythe little nipper the tiny
tot of the party

Gregory was furious He scowled at the artist like thunder

Go on said Mr MacAngus dont mind me I always tease little
important boys

My name is Gregory Bruce Avory said Gregory and I am seven I am
going to be an aviator I have to ask the farmers if we may camp in
their fields and I keep the corkscrew Please tell me he added why
you call your horse Pencil

Because he draws me said Mr MacAngus

And now he continued let us do the most interesting thing in the
world to people like ourselves let us examine each others caravans

After they had finished visiting each other and Mr MacAngus had given
them speaking as an old campaigner some very useful if simple hints
such as always pitching the tent with its back to the wind and keeping
inside a supply of dry wood to light the fires with and tying fern on
Mosess head against the flies and carrying cabbage leaves in their
own hats against the heat and walking with long staves instead of
short walking sticksafter this he made them all sit round their fire
and sketched them and the picture hangs at this very moment in Mrs
Avorys bedroom at The Gables

After lunch which he shared with them adding to the pot some very
fragrant mixed herbs from a little packet they lay on the grass round
him and he read to them from Shakespearefirst from Macbeth which
was very dreadful but fine and then from Midsummer Nights Dream
and the Winters Tale

After supper he took them outside the Hollow and they lay on their
backs and studied the stars about which he knew everything that can be
known and nothing whatever that Gregory wanted to know

And they went to bed early to be ready for the long journey on the
morrowwith their feet covered with Mr Lenoxs ointmentdeclaring it
was one of the most delightful days they had ever spent



CHAPTER 12

STRATFORDONAVON

The next morning was dull but dry and they were ready early for
there were sixteen miles to be done before StratfordonAvon was
reached They were however easy miles twelve of them being on the
flat beside the Stour

Mr MacAngus had decided to stay on in those parts a little longer
before making for Cropthorne and therefore after helping with the
inspanning as he called packing up he said goodbye but gave them a
list of the places where it was worth while asking for him They were
sorry to lose him but the immediate future was too exciting with
StratfordonAvon and Mrs Avory in it to allow time for regrets

After a day entirely without any adventures they found Mrs Avory She
was waiting for them at the Shakespeare Hotel which is one of the most
fascinating inns in England with staircases and passages in lavish
profusion and bedrooms named after the plays Hester and her mother
slept in the Winters Tale Janet and Mary in Cymbeline Robert and
Gregory were The Two Gentlemen of Verona for the time being and
Horace and Jack lay in the Comedy of Errors Kink and Diogenes were
somewhere at the back and the Slowcoach was in the yard surrounded by
motorcars

At the next table at dinnerin a beautiful old room with green matting
on the floor and a huge open fireplacesat an old gentleman with white
hair and bright eyes behind very luminous spectacles and from the tone
in which he talked to the waiter they guessed him to be an American
After dinner he smoked cigarettes in an immensely long holder of amber
and gold and now and then smiled at the children

They were all rather tired and went quickly to bed Robert who you
remember had been so contemptuous of the Shakespeare Hotel blankets
and sheets slept a full ten hours never indeed can a Gentleman of
Verona have passed a better night and the others expressed no grief at
having to lie in proper beds once more

When they came down to breakfast the next morning they found a letter
addressed to

 Mr KINKS CHILDRENS PARTY
 Shakespeare Hotel
 StratfordonAvon


Robert looked at it and threw it down

Very offensive he said

Mrs Avory handed it to Janet

Whoever can it be from Janet asked turning it over and over The
postmark is Chiswick

A good way to find out said Gregory is to open it

Janet did so and read it laughing Its an attempt at a nasty letter
from William she said Hes pretending to be cross because Jack won
Poor William Listen

DEAR LITTLE ONES

I hope you are having a good time in that stuffy caravan and manage
to avoid blisters I thought you would like to hear that father has
given me leave to go to Sheppey and stay for three days with Mr
Fowler who has promised to take me up in an aeroplane I am also to
have ridinglessons and Aunt Mildred has promised me a pony being so
sorry to hear that I was done out of the caravan trip by a fluke Uncle
Jim has sent me 5 pounds According to the papers the weather is going
to break up directly Your affectionate and prosperous friend

WILLIAM ROTHERAM


Jack was speechless with fury The storyteller he cried

But Mary laughed I think its rather clever she said It almost
took me in

Do you mean to say its a good joke Jack asked

I think so said Mary

I dont said Jack I think jokes ought to be straightforward I
think you ought to know exactly that they are jokes

Miss Bingham said Robert would say that such inventions were in
poor taste

So they are said Jack

Poor William said Mrs Avory You oughtnt to be cross with him
Jack After all he did lose when you tossed up

Yes said Jack But look here Mrs Avory suppose some of its
true

At this they all roared for it showed what Jacks trouble really was

Oh Jack said his sister you mustnt want everything Even if it
were true you ought to be much happier here

Have some more coffee Jack Mrs Avory said quickly

As it was Sunday they went to Trinity Church which usually costs
sixpence to enter because of Shakespeares tomba charge of which I
am sure the poet would not approve As the words in the sermon grew
longer and longer Hester made renewed efforts to get a glimpse of the
tomb but it was in a part of the chancel that was not within sight
She had instead to study the windows which she always liked to do in
church and she found herself repeating the lines on the tomb which
she had long known

 Good friend for Jesus sake forbeare
 To digg the dust enclosed heare
 Bleste be ye man Yt spares these stones
 And curst be he yt moves my bones

On Sunday even after service the church was not on view but the next
day it was there that they hurried directly after breakfast Hester
carrying with her some little bunches of flowers They paid their
sixpences and made straight for Shakespeares tomb and stood before
the coloured bustthat bust which you see in reproduction at every
turn in this loyal town It is perhaps more interesting than
impressive and the children had a serious argument over it Jack even
daring to say that the face was stupidlooking and Gregory declining
almost petulantly to consider Shakespeare in the least like a swan

Poor Hester how to defend him against these horrid boys

Janet came to the rescue by saying that Jack was probably thinking that
the forehead was too high but a high forehead was a sign of genius

It may be so said Jack but father has a poor patient with water on
the brain just like that What can you do with people who talk in
this way

But of course said Horace it doesnt matter what he looked like
really because he didnt write the plays at all They were written by
Roger Bacon

This led to acute trouble

How can you say such wicked things Hester protested bursting into
tears

But I read it in a book said Horace who had not wished to hurt her
but still desired to serve the truth It was sent to father

Everything in books isnt true said Janet

Oh I say said Horace

Of course its not said Mary Books are always being replied to and
squashed

Well this book was by a Member of Parliament said Horace

This was very awkward for the defenders of Shakespeare What were they
to do

Gregory who had not seemed to be interested in the debate settled it
He walked up to an old man who was standing near them and asked him
It isnt true he said is it that Shakespeares works were written
by Bacon

No said the old man its a wicked falsehood

How do you know asked Horace

How do I know exclaimed the old man Why Ive lived at Stratford
man and boy seventy years and of course I know

Of course said Janet

But a Member of Parliament says it was Bacon Horace persisted

Whats he Member for the old man asked Eh Not for
StratfordonAvon Ill be bound

I dont know said Horace who had nothing else to say

Take my advice the old man replied and dont believe anyone who
says that Shakespeare wanted help Look at that brow

But he isnt like a swan is he Gregory asked

Of course not said the old man Thats poetry If he had been like
a swan it wouldnt have been poetry to call him one

Gregory pondered for a little while Then he asked Would it be poetry
to call a swan a Shakespeare

Oh Gregory come away said Janet youre too clever this morning

Hester however still had much to do and she refused to go until she
had laid some flowers also on Anne Hathaways tomb and on that of
Susanna Shakespeares daughter who married Dr Hall She also copied
the epitaph which begins

 Witty above her sexe but thats not all
 Wise to Salvation was good Mistress Hall


But I am going too fast for this was Monday morning and we have not
yet accounted for all of Sunday The only Shakespeare relic which they
visited that day was the site of his house New Place close to the
hotel The house of course should be standing now and would be but
for the behaviour of a deplorable clergyman as you shall hear
Shakespeare grown rich and thinking of returning to Stratford from
London bought New Place for his home he died there in 1616 and his
wife and daughter or his descendants lived in it for many years
after And then it was bought by the Rev Francis Gastrell a Cheshire
vicar who began by cutting down Shakespeares mulberry treeunder
which not only the poet had sat but also Garrickbecause he was
annoyed that visitors wished to see it and then a little later in
his rage at the demand for the poor rate a tax to help support the
workhouse which since he was living elsewhere he considered he ought
not to have to pay he pulled down the building too That was in 1759
and now the site of the house is a public garden where you may walk and
still see of this memorable habitation only the traces of some of the
walls and Shakespeares well

They found the old gentleman from the hotel in the garden reading his
guidebook and it was he who told them the story So far as I can
understand said he nothing was done to the man at all Nobody
horsewhipped him It was lucky it did not happen in America

The old gentleman whose name was Nicholas Imber and who came from
Philadelphia then took them to see Harvard house of which he as an
American was very proud and they drifted about with him and looked
at other of the old Stratford buildings

All the time he kept on saying quietly to himself Vengeance on the
Rev Francis Gastrell

Perhaps said Hester there is a mistake in the verses in the
church Perhaps they ought to be

 Bleste be ye man yt spares these bones
 And curst be he yt moves my stones

That would mean the Rev Francis Gastrell

I hope so said Mr Imber Its a very good idea But why do you
like Shakespeare so

Hes so wonderful said Hester

Yes but so is Scott say and Dickens

Oh but Shakespeares so beautiful too said Hester

The children had gone alone to the church on the Monday morning On
returning to the hotel they found Mrs Avory ready for them and all
started for the birthplace in Henley Street where Shakespeare was
born probably on April 23 1564 This is now a museum with all kinds
of Shakespeare relics in it profoundly interesting to Hester if not to
the others The desk at which he sat in the Grammar School is there
and his big chair from the Falcon Inn at Bidford and many portraits
and on one of the windows scratched with a diamond is the name of Sir
Walter Scott The boys wanted to write their names too but it is no
longer allowed although I fancy that if Sir Walter Scott could visit
Stratford again he would be permitted to break the rule

They stood in the bedroom where Shakespeare was born and where his
father and mother probably died and they looked into the garden where
he used to play and Horace very mischievously pointed out the
fireplace in the kitchen where as he told Hester they cooked their
bacon

Mrs Avory was then informed of the mean attacks on Shakespeare which
Horace had made in the church and their complete refutation by the old
man whose judgment she upheld

Horace she said oughtnt to be here at all He ought to be at St
Albans We will look up the trains when we get back to the hotel

Horace was not quite certain whether this was serious or not Why St
Albans he asked

Because that is where your friend Bacon lived said Mrs Avory

The next place to visit was the Memorial which is a very ugly building
by the river where the Festival is held every spring This is not very
interesting to children being given up to books and pictures connected
with the stage but close by are the steps leading to the boats each
of which has a Shakespearian name and Mrs Avory allowed them to row
about for an hour before lunch This they did Robert and Mary and
Horace and Hester in the _Hermione_ and Janet and Gregory and Jack in
the _Rosalind_

After lunch while they were waiting about in the hall looking at the
pictures and not quite sure what to do Mr Imber of Philadelphia
approached them I wonder he said if you would do me a favour I
have scores of nephews and nieces and also many friends in America
to whom I want to send picture postcards Now he continued listen
here Heres seven shillings one for each of you and heres a
fiveshilling piece Now I am going to give you each a shilling to buy
picture post cards with and I want you each to buy them separatelyin
different shops if you likeand then bring them back to me and Ill
give the fiveshilling piece to the one who has what I think the best
collection Now off you go

So they hurried off StratfordonAvon I may tell you exists almost
entirely on the sale of picture postcards and Shakespeare relics and
there was therefore no difficulty in finding seven shops each with a
firstclass assortment

In this way an hour went very pleasantly and then the results were
laid before the old gentleman Of course there were many duplicates
but each collection had four or five cards that the others had not
After long consideration Mr Imber handed the five shillings to Mary

Gregorys was the only really original collection for taking
advantage of the circumstance that Mr Imber had said nothing about the
postcards being strictly of StratfordonAvon he had bought only what
pleased himself all being what are called comic cardsdreadful
pictures of mothersinlaw and twins and surprised lovers

Mr Imber laughed and told him to keep them

Now said Gregory selecting a peculiarly vulgar picture of a bull
tossing a rednosed man into a cucumber frame I shall send this to
Miss Bingham

Gregory exclaimed Janet you shall do nothing of the kind

Why not Gregory asked Shell only laugh and say How coarse

No said Janet well take them back to the shop and change them
for nice ones

Oh no not all Gregory pleaded Collins would love this one of the
policeman with a cold pie being put into his hand by the cook behind
his back

Very well said Janet you may send her that especially as were
getting her some pretty ones

Yes said Gregory and Eliza must have this one of the soldier
pushing the twins in the perambulator

Very well said Janet but no others

Oh yes said Gregory theres Runcie Im sure shed love this one
of the curate being pulled both ways at once by two fat women Shes so
religious

After tea they walked to Shottery to see Anne Hathaways cottage
although not even Hester could be very keen about the poets wife
Hester indeed had it firmly in her head that she was not kind to him
Otherwise she said he would have left her his best bed instead of
his secondbest bed

None the less Hester was very glad to have Mr Imbers present of
little china models of the cottage and the birthplace To the others he
gave either these or coloured busts of Shakespeare and to Gregory an
ivory pencilcase containing a tiny piece of glass into which you
peeped and saw twelve views of StratfordonAvon

After dinner they sat down to the serious task of writing on the
picture postcards which they had bought for themselves while Gregory
earned sixpence by sticking stamps on Mr Imbers vast supply Jack
felt it his duty also to write to William


DEAR WILLIAM

Thanks for your very kind and informing letter We are glad you are
having such a good time This is a rotten caravan and you are well out
of it Yours

J R

PSDont fall off your clotheshorse too often



CHAPTER 13

THE ADVENTURE OF THE YOUNG POLICEMAN

Mrs Avorys train to London was an early one and the Slowcoaches had
left Stratford behind them before ten and were by eleven at Binton
Bridges where the river again joins the road and where they stopped
to discuss the question whether to go straight on through Bidford and
the Salfords or to take the road to the south of the Avon through
Welsford and the Littletons

Robert was very firm for the Bidford way and of course he won and
as it happened it was very well that he did

It was a fine bracing day and they were all very vigorous after the
two days of rest in Stratford and they therefore trudged gaily along
in the sun not stopping again until just before Bidford on the hill
where Shakespeares crabtree used to grow under which he had slept so
long after one of his drinking contests For it seems to have been his
habit to go now and then with other Stratford friends to neighbouring
villages to see whether they or the villagers could drink the mosta
custom that even Hester found it hard to defend Indeed she got no
farther than to say I am sure he was naturally troubled by thirst

The tree has gone but another stands in its place and by this the
children sat and ate a little lunch and talked about the poet Robert
repeated to them the old rhyme about the Warwickshire villages which
Shakespeare is said to have composedpossibly in this very field

 Piping Pebworth dancing Marston
 Haunted Hillborough hungry Grafton
 Dodging Exhall Papist Wixford
 Beggarly Broom and drunken Bidford

Bidford is not drunken now it is only sleepy a long steep street
with at the top the church and a beautiful old house now cottages
once the Falcon Inn where Shakespeare used to drink and where the
chair came from that they had seen at the birthplace yesterday and at
the foot the Swan Inn and the old bridge

Bidford is built very like a wateringplacethat is to say it is all
on one side of the river The water today looked very tempting
especially as a great number of boats were lying on it waiting to be
hired but Robert sternly ordered his party onwards

Has it ever occurred to you that in the life of every policeman there
is one day when he wears his majestic uniform in public for the first
time It must of course be so No matter how many times he may have
put it on at home privately to get used to it the day must at last
come when he has to walk forth into the streets and in the eyes of
those who have known him ever since he was a boy or even a baby
changed from a man like themselves to an important and rather dreadful
guardian of the peace If he is a simple fellow the great day may
leave him very much as he was but if he is at all given to conceit it
may make him worse

Now it happened that this Tuesday on which the Slowcoaches were on
their way from Stratford to Evesham was the very day on which Benjamin
Roper was beginning his duties as a member of the Warwickshire
constabulary His beat in the morning lay between Bidford and Salford
Priors and he was standing beside the road on the top of the little
hill called Marriage Hilljust before you cross the River Arrow and
come to Salford Priors stationat the very moment that Moses after
painfully dragging the Slowcoach up the same eminence had reached the
summit

At the door of the caravan were to be seen Mary Hester and Gregory
whose turn it was to ride and PC Roper stared in astonishment at
faces so unlike the swarthy tanned children he was expecting

He stared so long indeedeverything being a little strange to him that
daythat Jack who with Horace was walking just behind politely but
with every intention of being severe inquired Do you think youll
know us next time

PC Roper said nothing but frowned at Jack with an expression so full
of dignity reprimand and suspicion that Jack could not help laughing

Oh I say he said dont be cross Maynt we go about in a caravan
if we want to No one else has objected

No Horace added the King said nothing as we came through London
and the Mayor of Stratford asked us to tea

Kink laughed at thismuch too loudlyand the young policeman realized
that he had been foolish Instead however of laughing too he became
more important and angry and suddenly he thought of a means of
retaliation

Pulling out a notebook and pencil he said I want to see your license
for this caravan He said this not because he really wanted to see it
but because it suggested itself as a good demand and one which would
make the children realize that he was a man of authority not to be
trifled with But when he saw the blank which fell on their faces and
even on Kinks too he knew that he had stumbled by chance on an
excellent weapon and he resolved to make the most of it

Come he said the license Im waiting to see it

Janet and Robert who had by this time come up were told of the
difficulty

License said Robert What license

All carriages must have licenses said the policeman and all
caravans have to produce theirs when called for because theyre always
moving about

The children gathered round Kink to discuss it Kink said that it was
all Greek to him He supposed of course that caravans had to have
licenses but hed never heard of demands for them in the highroad
But do be civil to him Master Robert he implored You never get
any good out of cheeking the police

Well said Robert to the constable this caravan was given to us
The license for it was got I feel sure by the person who gave it to
us

Who was that person PC Roper asked with his pencil ready to write
down the name

Here was a poser Who indeed The children had discussed X often
enough but were no nearer to discovering him

I dont know Robert was forced to say

PC Roper smiled a deadly smile Oho he said You dont know who
gave you the caravan Things are looking up Caravans drop from the
sky do they A very thin story indeed Ill trouble you to come with
me all of you and see my inspector

PC Roper was quite happy now He had not only filled the impertinent
children with fear but he had done a smart thing on his very first day
as constable He drew himself up and returned the notebook to his
pocket

Your inspector Robert said Where does he live

Well said PC Roper he lives at Bidford but hes at Stratford
today at the Police Court and he wont be back till the evening

We cant wait till evening Robert said It would throw out all our
plans

Plans exclaimed PC Roper Plans indeed Arent you
suspiciouslooking persons in the possession of an unlicensed caravan
and unable to give any reasonable account of how you got it Your plans
can wait

Please give us a little time to discuss it Janet said and they all
surrounded Kink once more

Of course its absurd Jack said but what an awful pity you dont
know who X is Thats what makes the trouble It looks so silly too

Do you really think that caravans have to show licenses Janet asked
Kink

I never thought about it Kink said but it sounds reasonable in a
way Gipsies you know If Master Campbell hadnt said that about the
King and the Mayor I shouldnt have laughed and then the copper
wouldnt have lost his wool and we should be all right

Never mind about that said Janet We cant bother about what is
done The thing is what we are to do How funny of Mr Lenox not to
have thought about the licensehe thought of everything else

Yes and X too said Robert But its just terrible to have to go
back and wait all day for the inspector We are due at Evesham this
afternoon

Couldnt we overpower him Horace said and bind him and leave him
in the ditch

Yes said Hester or ask him to have a glass of milk and drug it

Dont be absurd said Robert This is serious All right he called
out to PC Roper who was getting anxious were just coming

Then Janet had a happy thought I say she exclaimed where is that
envelope that Uncle Christopher gave us He said we were to open it if
we got into a real mess Well nows the time

Its in the safe said Robert and he dashed into the caravan and
brought it out

Janet opened it and read it slowly Then she smiled a radiant smile
and advancing to the constable handed him a paper

Here is the license she said you will find our name and address on
it Now perhaps we may go on

PC Roper read the license very carefully frowned and handed it back

It would save a lot of trouble he said if you would produce such
things directly you were asked for them

But we didnt know wed got it Janet said

PC Roper pressed his hand to his forehead I dont know where I am
he muttered

Theyve got a caravan and they dont know who gave it to them and
theyve got envelopes and they dont know whats in them Does your
mother know youre out he added as a farewell shot

The Slowcoaches could not help it they gave him three cheers and then
three more for Uncle Christopher

Well said Janet thats all right but its lucky he did not see
Uncle Christophers letter Listen

DEAR CHILDREN

It has suddenly occurred to me that some ass of a policeman may want
to see your license and I have therefore procured one for you If you
get into any kind of trouble be sure to give my name and address and
telegraph for me

Your affectionate Uncle
 CHRIS


It would have been better Kink said if your uncle had handed you
the license right awaynot made a mystery of it

Oh no said Hester

As it happened they were destined not to reach Evesham that day for
at Abbots Salford Moses cast a shoe and that meant the blacksmith and
delay When the accident was discovered and the children were
surrounding Moses and helping Kink in his examination of the hoof a
farmer who was walking by stopped and joined them He asked the
trouble and offered them his advice

You put your caravan in my yard there he said pointing to a
beautiful gateway just ahead and you make yourselves comfortable
there while the horse is being shod Ill show you the house if you
like he added its very old and haunted too and theres a grand
boatingplace at the weir just across the meadows Dont worry about the
horse or anything If you go to bed early and get up early it will
come to the same thing as if you had gone right on

Everyone except Robert who liked to see his timetables obeyed and
perhaps Gregory who had been deprived for some days of his office of
asking leave for a campingground and was now balked again was glad
of the mischance that brought camp so early and Hester was wild with
pleasure for Salford Hall is an old mansion of grey stone built three
hundred years ago and now mysterious and except for a few rooms
desolate It has also an old garden and a fishpond and a little Roman
Catholic chapel whose altarcandles have been alight for centuries

The farmer was very kind He gave the children leave to go anywhere and
everywhere but they must not he said run or jump because the floors
were not strong enough He led them from room to room to the
dancinggallery in the roof

There was a very old bagatelletable in one room all motheaten and a
few old pictures still on the wallsa knight and his lady with
Elizabethan ruffs and a portrait of a greyhound From a top window the
farmer showed them Eveshams belltower

But the most exciting moment was when each of them in turn was allowed
to hide in the priests hidinghole This was a very ingenious cupboard
behind a row of shelves intended to have books or china on them which
swung back when you loosened a catch Hester crouched here and shut her
eyes and firmly believed that the Protestants were after her

In her next letter she implored her mother to take the Hall and live
there in the summer I am sure she wrote it would be very cheap
because it is so shabby and is crumbling away in many places I would
gladly live in the priests hidinghole always Please think about it
seriously

Afterwards the farmer showed them the way down to the weir over the
railway and advised them to have the caravan taken down there and
sleep there that night near the rushing water

You couldnt have done it two months ago he said

Why not Robert asked

Guess why said the farmer

And will you believe it none of them could guess

Because it was flooded said the farmer In winter its often just a
great lake from the railway at the foot of our garden right to the
Marlcliff Hills

And so Moses with a beautiful new shoe was put into the shafts again
and they went gently over the soft green meadows to the weir and there
they had their supper and explored the mill and the shaggy wood
overhanging it and rowed a little in a very safe boat and stood on
the little bridges and watched the rushing water and then walked
slowly beside the still stream higher up as the light began to fade
and surprised the waterrats feeding or gossiping on the banksnone of
which things could they have done had Moses had the poor sense to
retain his near foreshoe



CHAPTER 14

THE ADVENTURE OF THE LITTLE OLD LADY

They left the weir very early the next morning after a breakfast from
the cold ham which Mrs Avory had bought them at Stratford On their
way through the village they stopped at Salford Hall because Hester
and Gregory had had an argument as to whether or not it was possible to
hear the breathing of the person in the hidinghole The farmer allowed
them to go upstairs and try and as it happened Hester was right and
you could hear it if you had patience Gregory came out again as
purple as a plum through holding it in so long

Then they said goodbye to the farmer and strode on through Harrington
and Norton and a little beyond this Robert took those that cared about
it to see the obelisk on the site of the Battle of Evesham at which
Simon de Montfort was killed in 1265 And so they came through the
orchards of plumtrees on which the fruit was now forming to Evesham
itself

It was while they were walking through Evesham beside or behind the
Slowcoach in the middle of the road that Janet felt a hand on her
arm and looking round perceived a very small and very neat and very
anxious little servant maid

Please she said Miss Redstone my mistress says will you all step
into her house and partake of refreshment and do her a very great
favour

Janet could hardly believe her ears

All of us she exclaimed

Yes said the little servant all please

Janet thought very hard for a moment or two Who was this Miss
Redstone What would Mrs Avory do under the same circumstances she
was asking herself Which house she inquired at last

That one said the little anxious servant pointing to the neatest
and brightest little house you ever saw with dazzling steps and a
shining knocker and a poor little pathetic face peering hopefully over
the blind

The pathetic little face settled it All right Janet said at once
and calling the others together and telling Kink to wait for them
outside the town she led them in

They were shown into a tiny and spotless parlour with woolwork
footstools where after a moment or so they were joined by Miss
Redstone the little old lady whom Janet had seen at the window but
whose face was now smiling and contented

You must think me very strange my dears she said but I will
explain I am Godfrey Fairfax

A dreadful silence fell on the room The children looked at each other
shamefacedly and almost in fear for they thought the little old lady
must be mad

As for her she again looked the picture of woe O dear she said
is it possible that none of you have ever even heard of me Surely one
of my stories must have found its way to your house

Do you write stories Janet asked

Yes I have written lots but Im afraid they dont sell as they ought
to Of course Godfrey Fairfax is not my real name it is just the name
I take as a writer because people prefer that books should be written
by a man rather than by a woman I am really Miss Redstone Why I
called you in was to ask if you would be so very kind as to sit down
and have some cake and milk while I read you my last storyquite a
short oneand you can tell me what you think of it There are so few
children that I know here and it makes such a difference to get some
real criticism Do you mind

They all said they didnt mind at all and after the cake and milk had
been brought in by the little servant Godfrey Fairfax cleared her
throat and began

It is a story she said of Roundheads and Cavaliersa very
suitable story to write here so close to the battlefields of
Tewkesbury and Marston Moor It is called Barbaras Fugitive Now
listen my dears


BARBARAS FUGITIVE

On a bright June morning early in the Protectorate Colonel Myddelton
followed by a groom rode through the gates of the old Hall and turned
his horses head towards London At the bend in the road halfway up
Sheringham Hill he stopped a moment and waved his hand in the
direction of the house A white handkerchief fluttered at an upper
window in reply

My poor lonely Barbara said the Colonel smiling tenderly as he
passed again out of sight of his daughter

Dear father said Barbara as the Colonel disappeared from view She
did not however at once leave the window but remained leaning out
with the warm touch of the sun on her head drinking in the morning
sounds

The village half a mile distant was just visible to Barbara through
the treesredroofed compact the cottages gathering about the church
like chickens round the mother hen On a summer day like this anyone
listening at the Hall could hear the busy noises the hum of this
little hive of humanity with perfect clearness the beat of the hammer
on the anvil in Matthew Hales smithy the Gee whoa of the carter
on the distant road the scrunching of the wagonwheels the crowing
cocks and now and then the shouts of boys and the laughter of
children These audible tokens of active life were a comfort to
Barbara A moment before on parting with her father she was aware of
a new and disturbing loneliness but now she felt no longer with the
same melancholy that she was solitary apart from her fellows

It was the time when the country was divided between the followers of
the Throne and the followers of Cromwell the time when sour visages
who were for the moment in the places of authority glowered beneath
black hats and the village games were forbidden the time when
Royalist gentlemen dropped a crumb into their wineglasses after dinner
and looking meaningly at each other tossed off the red liquor saying
fervently as they did so God send this CRUMB WELL down But actual
fighting was over and the country on the surface peaceable again
although a word often was sufficient to draw forth steel among the high
folks or set an inn full of villagers to fisticuffs There was not a
Royalist in the country but awaited the moment when he could strike
another blow to avenge his dead master and reinstate his young Prince
Among these loyal gentlemen Colonel Myddelton was not the least

Colonel Myddelton was a widower and Barbara young though she was had
long acted as the mistress of the household Yet in spite of her good
sense and caution Barbara had been the obstacle to the Colonels
departure She was he considered unfit to be left alone with no more
stalwart companions than old Digger the maids and the children but
her repeated assurances that she felt no foreboding at last conquered
and that morning as we have seen he had ridden off

You know father she had told him again and again Philip is close
at hand and truly I can see no danger Was not I alone for days and
nights together when you were with the King and the Prince

Well well the Colonel had responded at last but I shall speak a
word to Matthew as I pass the forge today and he will keep his eye on
the place Matthew Hale the blacksmith had served under Colonel
Myddelton in more than one campaign and he rang as true as his own
anvil

Thus it was that Barbara was left alone in the great house with none
to bear her company but Jack who was but twelve and Marjorie who was
but eight and little Alys and old Digger the odd man and the maids
There were also it is true stablemen and gardeners but they lived in
the village

The next of age to Barbara was Philip Philip Sidney Myddelton in full
so named after that sweet and noble gentleman and soldier who fell at
Zutphen Philip was sixteen and at this time was still at his lessons
with Mr Fullarton of Framshott a village eight miles distant Mr
Fullarton was a ripe scholar who kept a house wherein some score of
boys whose parents had no strong liking for the great grammar schools
were received and fitted with enough learning to take them into Oxford
or Cambridge The boys ranged in age from ten to seventeen and at this
time Philip was their leader None could shoot with a crossbow as
skillfully as he that very spring he had killed twentythree
waterrats and you know how wary they are none was so fearless a
rider none more expert at flying the hawk or training hounds The
boys worthy instructor received a liberal sum in payment for his
services and his house was thus made more of a home than a mere
school Each boy who wanted it was permitted to keep his own horse and
dog and after lessons were over their liberty was little encroached
upon provided that they observed the rules of the house

The Reverend Jeremy Fullarton was Royalist to the marrow and only
Royalists entrusted their sons to his keeping hence the house was a
home of Cavalier sentiment The older boys had even constituted
themselves into a little corps and all games had given way before the
joys of drilling and military tactics Here again Philip led although
his sworn allies Hugh Lorimer and Vernon Hutchinson a nephew of the
great Colonel Hutchinson whose memoirs were written by his wife Lucy
and Rupert Ommaney shared the command Not often do you find a bond
uniting as many as four schoolboys in devoted friendship but such was
the case with this gallant quartet Philip and Hugh Rupert and Vernon


IS IT INTERESTING THE LITTLE OLD LADY ASKED EARNESTLY

VERY SAID JANET

I LIKE BARBARA SAID HESTER

I LIKE PHILIP SAID GREGORY

GODFREY FAIRFAX WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN AGAIN WHEN HORACE INTERRUPTED

EXCUSE ME HE SAID BUT IVE BEEN THINKING DIDNT YOU WRITE FOR
THE GOOD CAUSE

YES SHE SAID

WHY SAID HORACE THATS MY FAVOURITE BOOK YOU REMEMBER THAT JACK
THE WARS OF THE ROSES AND THE YORKIST FAMILY YOU MUST REMEMBER WHERE
THE SPYGILES FEATHERHEADIS CAUGHT IN THE BUTTERY AND HOW THEY DUCK
HIM

OF COURSE I DO SAID JACK ITS PERFECTLY RIPPING

GODFREY FAIRFAX WAS SO PLEASED TO HEAR THIS THAT HER VOICE FOR A MOMENT
OR TWO WAS QUITE HUSKY THEN SHE RESUMED


In the evening Matthew Hale appeared bearing a basket of tools and
insisted upon testing all locks and bolts and Barbara and he explored
the house together making all safe with the exception of a window in
the library This room was on the groundfloor easily accessible and
try as he would there was one window which the blacksmith could not
secure The good fellow was for sleeping on the floor all night by way
of guard but Barbara would not hear of it and in the end Bevis the
mastiff the great dog that had followed Colonel Myddelton into camp in
the late war was chained outside the window Satisfied with this
arrangement Matthew pulled his forelock and said good night and
Barbara prepared for bed

Folks kept better hours in those days than we now do First she peeped
in at the sleeping children Then she talked long and earnestly with
the cook concerning the morrows programme and at nine oclock she
climbed to her room

Barbara however could not sleep so after an hour or two had passed
she rose lit a candle threw on a wrap and descended the broad
staircase intent upon a queer and enthralling Spanish bookthe story
of a mad knight and his comic matteroffact attendant which was a
favourite of her fathers

The book was wont to stand in a corner of the library close to his hand
as he sat writing by the window and opening the door Barbara crossed
the floor with her hand outstretched to take it So familiar was she
with the mad knights position on the shelves that she carried no light

Her hand was within a yard of the sheepskin cover when she leaped back
with frozen blood for there a foot from her in her fathers chair
was the figure of a man Instantly she remembered the open window A
breath from the roses floated in and fanned her face until her dying
day Barbara had but to be conscious of the scent of roses to see again
that darkened room to feel again that tightening of the heart She
could neither scream nor move

The tension was snapped by the man himself who suddenly awoke and
stretched his arms and in doing so smote Barbara on the shoulder He
sprang to his feet with a cry of astonishment and apology and at that
moment she was herself again

A thousand pardons he said bowing low before her

Whowho are you Barbara found words to ask And what is your
business here It is no part of a gentlemans behaviour to enter houses
by the window

Nay said the man and Barbara noted that his speech was of one
gently bornnay it is truly no gentlemans conduct but in these
days when Kings are laid low at the hands of traitorsand his voice
had a bitter ringand rebels sit in high places a gentleman must
perforce descend to trickery and meanness now and then

Barbara repeated her question But tell me who you are and what you
want There is a gate to the place there are servants to open it Why
did you steal upon us thus And Bevis she added as a sudden
misgiving seized her he was chained by the window Have you killed
him Oh say you have not hurt Bevis

Nay I could not hurt an old friend said the stranger Bevis and I
are old friends He remembered me at once

Barbaras fear diminished somewhat at these words Old friends she
exclaimed half reassured

Yes said the stranger we were together in the west Colonel
Mvddelton whom I have striven hither to talk with and I went through
a campaign together a futile campaign I fear with more of pursuit
than pursuing but for a high cause Ifaith it seems my lot to be
pursued And you fair lady for dark though it is I know you are
fair are you Colonel Myddeltons daughter the mistress Barbara of
whom he has told me

I am Colonel Myddeltons daughter said Barbara But you sir

Right right the stranger replied more gaily you ply me hard but
my name stays secret none the less Yet this ring may perhaps convince
you I am no common housebreaker See it was the gift of your father
and a passport so he said to Myddelton Hall by day or night And he
stretched forth a ring which Barbara immediately recognized as an old
signet of her fathers which suddenly he had ceased to wear he said
not why She was partially satisfied And Bevis added the
strangertake it will you not dear lady as a good omen that Bevis
let me pass almost unchallenged But your father he went onis he
ill or away or will you lead me to him Had I not fallen asleep I
was about to seek his room As for entering by the gate you must know
young mistress the danger now run by friends of the late King

Ah yes said Barbara with a sigh My father she added rode
this morning to London where he will be a week yet but I can tell you
where he is lodged Will you not follow him

London the young man repeated in disappointed tones what does he
there London is no place for a true man

He has ridden thither said Barbara on matters touching his
property which the rebels would confiscate

Rebels cried the stranger excitedly Ha a good word in your mouth
young mistress I like to hear you say that thus roundly Zounds he
added it is ill news that your father is away for I have but a few
hours in this country and I must even return without accomplishing my
mission To London I dare not adventure But mistress will you not
bring a light that we may see if we still doubt each other and then
we must talk of a plan of safety

Stay where you are said Barbara and I will fetch a candle

During her absence the stranger had not moved As she entered he
stepped forward and took the light from her holding it high and
scrutinizing her face narrowly

Ah he exclaimed at last with a sigh good as gold Would that
other lands could breed such grace It is ill to be banished from ones
own countrywomen

Barbara blushed and turned away

The young man who was soberly clad had dark almost black hair and
dark eyes His mouth was perhaps too loose but he was prepossessing A
certain melancholy an air of bafflement seemed to overshadow him
Barbaras sympathy was his at that moment and he knew it

There is a hidingplace in the house he said after a pause your
father has told me of it

Barbara started but at these words her last suspicion vanished
There is she replied simply

Then will you lodge me there the stranger answered The gravest
issues depend upon the success with which my visit here is kept secret
So far I believe I have eluded suspicion and pursuit but these
Roundheads are cunning as jackals And dear preserver might I crave
some food and drink

Alas exclaimed Barbara I have delayed hospitality too long But
you see she added smiling such visitors are rare at Myddelton
Hall Our gates fly wide to welcome my fathers friends when we know of
their approach I assure you sir

The stranger bowed and smiling in reply lost for the moment his air
of melancholy

Your hidingplace is close at hand she said and looked again at the
ring

It was certainly her fathers she had often seen it on his hand And
Bevis too No there could be no longer any doubt as to the
strangers genuineness At least if there were she banished it
forthwith for moving swiftly to the door she locked it and then
crossing the room to the fireplace held up the light and revealed a
portrait of an elderly man in Elizabethan costume

My greatgrandfather she said with whom as I will show you
liberties have been taken

So saying she climbed on a chair and reaching upward pressed her
finger against the portraits right eye As she did so a spring was
set in motion and the picture slid upwards taking the top line of the
heavy oak frame with it and leaving the remaining three sides in their
place disclosing a cavity in the wall

Climb in there Barbara said handing the candle to the stranger
and turn sharp to the right and then to the left and you will come
to an iron door which rises and falls like a portcullis The handle is
of no use but on the ceiling you will see the motto _Nil
desperandum_ which you must take as counsel offered to yourself
Press the space in the centre of the D and the door will open

The stranger did so

Now Barbara called to him wait a little and I will bring you
food

She replaced the picture and sought the kitchen soon returning with
the remains of a pasty and a flask of Rhenish which after again
touching the spring she handed up to her guest He took them and
disappeared into the passage whither with the assistance of a chair
and a scramble Barbara followed him

The room was a minute but very complete retreat A little bed stood in
the corner and by its side a tiny table and chair on which were
writing materials

Tomorrow sir said Barbara I will come and inquire after you You
want sleep now I wish you good rest and good fortune And so saying
she left him


GODFREY FAIRFAX PAUSED AGAIN WELL SHE SAID DO YOU STILL LIKE IT

VERY MUCH SAID JANET

ITS VERY EXCITING SAID MARY

I LIKE THE HIDINGPLACE SAID GREGORY

WEVE JUST SEEN ONE AT SALFORD HALLONLY THAT WAS FOR PRIESTSINSIDE
A CHINA CUPBOARD I GOT IN IT THE PICTURES MUCH BETTER

DO YOU LIKE IT MISS REDSTONE SAID TO ROBERT

PRETTY WELL HE ANSWERED AND THEY ALL LAUGHED

DONT LAUGH SAID MISS REDSTONE THATS JUST THE KIND OF REMARK I
WANT NOW TAKE SOME MORE CAKE ALL OF YOU AND I WILL GO ON


Barbara awoke almost with the birds after two or three hours of fitful
sleep and with a rush came the memory of last nights events Her
first thought was for the quick and safe departure of the stranger and
weariness of head told her it was time to seek advice

Oh if father were here was the burden of her thoughts But he was
far away and the immediate question was whom to ask for help She
ticked off the neighbouring gentlemen and decided against them one by
one Old Digger was useless Matthew Hale was sound but stupid
Everything pointed to her brother Philip

No sooner had she made up her mind than Barbara turned to her
writingtable and penned a laborious letter to the Rev Jeremy Poor
Barbara Spelling was not her strongest point nor indeed did anyone
then mind whether spelling was good or bad She wrote as follows

DEARE AND REVEREND SIR

My father has riden to London and I would faine not be without manlie
companie in so grate an house olde Digger being worthie and trustie
but a lyttel deaf and stiffe Therefor I pray you let me have my
brother Philip and his friends for this daye that I may be more at mine
ease

Your servant
 BARBARA MYDDELTON


Having sanded and folded the paper Barbara awakened Jack

Jack she called shaking him in his bed Jack I have an errand for
you Jump up quickly and dress and then saddle Roger and I will get
you some food and then you must ride at a gallop to Framshott to Mr
Fullartons and he will send back Philip with you and Hugh and Vernon
and Rupert

Having seen the little fellow off Barbara set the servants to work on
a business that would keep them remote from the library and then
visited her guest She first knocked three times on the chimneya sign
that had been agreed on After a minute had passed he replied and
having made certain that no one could enter or see into the library
Barbara removed the picture and waited

The young man immediately sprang into the room

Good morrow sir said Barbara simply with a curtsey

Good morrow fair hostess and preserving angel said the young man
with a bow

We must come to business at once said Barbara and forthwith she
told him of her message to her brother Philip is very young she
added but true as steel and his head is older than his years

Good said the stranger and he unfolded his plans That night he
must embark for France He was expected by the master of the
_Antelope_ a schooner lying all ready to weigh anchor at Portallan
the harbour twelve miles distant She would sail by the night tide
with or without him It was understood that if he were not there evil
had befallen him

Everything depends he explained on my departure tonight The
cause hangs upon it A blight on my evil luck he cried Were Colonel
Myddelton at home I should not be fleeing from my own country
emptyhanded I shall be writing to him most of this day but a spoken
word is worth a volume of pen stuff

It was arranged at length that as soon as the dusk came three of the
boys with the stranger wearing the clothes of the fourth should ride
out ostensibly on the return to the schoolhouse

Thus no suspicion would be aroused and once in the road it would be
simple to turn the horses heads towards the sea and gain the harbour

That settled Barbara gave breakfast to her guest and he returned to
his hidingplace for the rest of the weary day with a store of candles
and an armful of books and paper

Two hours later the boys rode in all excitement and Barbara watched
them attack the loaded breakfasttable Philips friends were of
course all devoted to this grave sweet girl although not bitter
rivals

Philip dear said Barbara swiftly when after breakfast she had
drawn her brother into her room and locked the door there is in the
castle at this moment a messenger from the Prince who has come to see
our father on grave business You can guess what such business would
be He dare not follow him to London and must leave tonight for the
nearest seaport his errand all unperformed I sent for you and your
friends because the gentleman is our guest and must be treated with
courtesy and care He is unattended and the countryside is alive with
traitors You and your friends will protect him tonight will you not

To the death said Philip

Ah I knew said his sister proudly

Barbara exclaimed Philip it was fine of you to send for us And
he hugged her mightily But where is the gentleman

In hiding she answered but mind not a word of this to the others
Tell them enough to stop questions Not a soul knows he is here save
you and me Later they must know for one of you will have to lend him
clothes Only three of you can ride as his guard

But Barbara cried Philip in alarm it is not I who will stay
behind It could not be I am his host And what build of man is he
Barbara Say he is not my size

No Phil dear he is taller by a hands breadth

Ah sighed Philip with intense relief then it must be Rupert Poor
Rupert

Now said Barbara forget all about it and have a good holiday with
the boys The evening is distant yet

I wish it were here Phil exclaimed fervently as he ran off

Philip at once sought out Rupert and slipping his hand into his arm
led him away from the others He wanted to break the news gently

I say Rupert he said you remember that crossbow of mine you
wanted so much

Rupert remembered

Well it is yours said Philip And I want you to ride Tiger oftener
than you do Tiger was Philips most prized horse

Rupert was beginning to be mystified but he could see that all this
was but the preamble to something more important

And Rupert Philip continued you know how keen we all are to smash
those Roundheads dont you

Rupert knew

But it isnt always possible you understand for everyone to fight
and be in the front is it Some have to do quieter work where they are
not seen havent they

Rupert agreed a little impatiently But Phil he added what does
all this mean What do you want me to do

Well said Philip I cant tell you everything but tonight it may
be necessary for some of us to ride to Portallan and one to stay
behind and I thought I would try to make it easier for you to be the
one to stay behind thats all It must be you Im afraid poor old
fellow

The reader paused again


I LIKE THAT BIT ABOUT SPELLING SAID JACK

I THINK BARBARA AND PHILIP WERE VERY LUCKY SAID ROBERT THERES NO
FUN LIKE THAT NOW WY IS ALL THE FUN IN THE PAST

I THINK ITS FUN TO GO FOR A CARAVANTOUR SAID MISS REDSTONE AND
THATS IN THE PRESENT

OH YES SAID ROBERT THATS FUN NO DOUBT BUT IT DOESNT COMPARE
WITH FIGHTING AGAINST ROUNDHEADS

I THINK BARBARA WAS MOST HORRIBLY LUCKY SAID HESTER BECAUSE OF
COURSE THE STRANGER WAS

HUSH SAID THE AUTHOR AND SHE BEGAN TO READ ONCE MORE


The day wore on slowly Barbara did her best to go through the
household duties naturally but the tension was severe She was
perpetually conscious of a fear that after all in spite of his
confidence in his skill the stranger might have been tracked and
pursued

She had indeed in the peace of the afternoon but just dismissed the
suspicion when the white face of Philip appearing suddenly at the door
of the library where she was sitting brought back all her tremors

Roundheads he gasped

Her heart stood still Oh if father were here was all she could
murmur moaningly as the clatter of hoofs rung out in the courtyard

A minute later old Digger tottered in shaking like a reed followed by
an officer and three soldiers Barbara rose to meet them biting her
lips to repress her emotion What is it she inquired coldly

Guard the doors and the windows said the Captain to his men ignoring
her He looked round the room and then condescended to reply

We are seeking a rebel he said He has been traced to this
neighbourhood and it would be natural for him to seek hospitality
here The Myddeltons are fond of such dirt

This roof shelters no rebels said Barbara simply

Colonel Myddelton this doddering old fool tells me said the
Captain indicating Digger is away

Clearly said Barbara or your language would be more guarded

And no one has come seeking refuge the Captain pursued adding to
Barbaras intense relief But asking questions is sheer waste of
breath I have no time to talk We must search the house

Barbara sank into her chair again Surely they must hear the beating of
her heart she thought Oh anything anything to appear calm The risk
was doublefirst that they might themselves discover the secret
place secondly that in tapping the walls as they were even now
doing they might give her signal to the fugitive and thus cause him
to betray himself She buried her face in her embroidery but was aware
that the Captains eyes were on her The soldiers were passing round
the room slowly thoroughly In the stress of her perturbation Barbara
rose and moved to the door controlling her agitation with a tremendous
effort

Follow the lady said the Captain to one of the soldiers Dont lose
sight of her for a moment The minx knows something he muttered in
his moustache

You brute cried Philip drawing his sword Do you dare to order my
sister to be dogged Come on And he made a lunge at the Roundhead

Steady said the Captain parrying the thruststeady young fellow

Barbara catching at the door screamed and swooned

Philip thrust at him again

Be still muttered the Captain we must have no bloodshed here And
he twitched the weapon from the boys hand adding Very well I
withdraw the order Carry your sister to her room and my soldier shall
merely stand sentinel at her door Another word you puppy and Ill
have you in irons

With an effort Philip obeyed remembering the duty the night held for
him and he and Digger together carried Barbara to her room followed
by the soldier who took up his stand at the door

On resuming their search the soldiers did no more than thrust their
pikes up the chimney and in a few minutes proceeded to the other rooms

An hour later the Captain sent for Philip who sauntered into his
presence whistling a country dance

I am going at once said the Captain

Philip had it in his mind to press him ironically to stay with a word
of regret that his visit was so short but he stifled the temptation
and simply nodded

But I am not in the least satisfied the Captain continued and I
mean to leave three soldiers behind to guard the entries and your
sisters room No one leaves the Hall tonight

Philips face fell But I must he said I am at school at
Framshott and we my companions and I must ride back tonight

Your companions said the Captain

Yes said Philip I will call them And he shouted from the window
to the boys playing bowls in the garden

They came up and were passed before the scrutinizing eyes of the
Roundhead

Royalist whelps he muttered Very well he said at length you
may go But mind no one else leaves the house

Then giving careful instructions to the three men left in charge he
rode off with the others

News spreads rapidly in villages at all times and it was therefore
not surprising that Matthew Hale should hear that there were Roundheads
at Myddelton Hall very soon after they had clattered into the courtyard

Roundheads at the Hall are there he said Then I reckon Ill join
them It wont be the first time Ive met a Roundheadno nor smashed
one either So saying he laid aside his hammer and taking instead
a bar of iron he left his boy in charge of the smithy and set out for
the Hall

Matthew reached the Hall a few minutes after the Captain and two of the
Roundheads had ridden off The first person he saw was Philip who
with the three boys and little Jack were plotting together in the
shrubbery

Hullo Matt cried Philip come here We want you

Matthew turned aside from the carriageway and joined the little group
They all looked profoundly grave and important

What is it young master said the blacksmith And wheres Mistress
Barbara Dont say shes ill

Then Philip told him the story omitting all reference to the refugee
whose existence was a secret to the other boys from the arrival of the
Captain to his departure ending

And at this very moment Matt there are three Roundhead soldiers on
guard in the Halltwo at the doors and one standingcan you believe
itstanding at my sisters door Ive fought him once Philip
continued but hes too strong and now the others are keeping us out
of the house and weve charged them several times but without doing
any good and there are a thousand reasons why we shouldnt any of us
be hurt

But where are the grooms and gardeners Matthew asked

Oh they all disappeared said Philip I suppose they feared an
inquiry might be dangerous Its bad for the health and reputation to
fight a Roundhead

Matthew laughed grimly Its bad for the Roundheads health if he runs
against this he said raising the iron bar

At this moment Jack interrupted See Phil he cried Barbaras
waving to you at the window

It was so They all glanced up and at the window Barbaras pale face
was visible

A sudden thought came to Philip and leading Matthew into the open he
pointed to the blacksmith and threw an inquiring look to his sister
She hesitated a second or two and then nodded yes with cheery
emphasis so Philip led Matthew away and supplemented the story he had
already told him with the startling announcement that all the time
there actually was a fugitive Cavalier in the house

Matthew Hale whistled he had no words

And he must reach Portallan said Philip to catch the midnight
tide Three of us are going to ride with him and he takes Ruperts
clothes We should have got him away finely if it hadnt been for these
soldiers

Then we must smash the soldiers said Matthew simply How many are
they Three and one of them upstairs And we are five not counting
Master Jack Very well So long as they dont use gunpowder we can
beat them

In a few minutes the old soldier had sketched out a plan of action


GODFREY FAIRFAX AGAIN PAUSED

ITS GETTING RATHER GOOD SAID ROBERT

HOW SPLENDID IF WE COULD HAVE A CIVIL WAR NOW

I LIKE MATTHEW HALE BEST SAID GREGORY

ARE THEY REALLY GOING TO FIGHT ARE THE BOYS REALLY GOING TO KILL
ANYONE ITS SO ROTTEN IN MOST STORIES BECAUSE THEY ONLY TALK ABOUT
IT

WAIT SAID THE AUTHOR


The sentinels were stationed each at one door at the back of the house
twenty or thirty yards apart The principal entrance they had locked
so that there remained to guard only the two doors into the courtyard
Their instructions were to permit the boys to pass in and out and to
ride off at evening unmolested but the attacks made upon them prompted
the additional precaution to keep the aggressive four out of the house
altogether The two men walked up and down at their posts and
occasionally exchanged a remark together and occasionally threw a
glance at the shrubbery They seemed however to feel no apprehension

Can any one of you climb the blacksmith asked suddenly

I can said Jack

Famous said the blacksmith then come with me So saying he led
the way down the shrubbery until the front of the house was in view
Now he added you shall climb that pipe And he pointed to a pipe
by the doorway The ivy will help you

And when I am at the top Jack asked

When you are at the top said the blacksmith you will loosen a
stone and drop it on the head of one of your friends
yonderindicating the courtyard with a jerk of his head That will
settle him At the same moment Ill overwhelm the other We must
prevent them firing at any costs But dont miss him whatever you do
or we are worse off than before

No said Jack I shall aim very carefully I will wait till he is
exactly underneath and then plob It will get him on his topknot

The ivy was of course out of sight of the two sentries so long as
they stayed at their posts but as anyone who knows Myddelton Hall
which is little altered since that time will understand a very
trifling extension of his beat would bring one of them into a position
to command the carriagedrive which Jack had to cross to get from the
shrubbery to the house However the boy sauntered off looking as
aimless as a piece of floating thistledown and gained the house
unperceived Directly he was past the soldiers line of vision he
became brisker and in a few minutes the party in the shrubbery who
had by this time returned to their original post and at the point in
the bushes nearest to the sentries saw him scrambling over the roof

If he were hurt said the blacksmith the Colonel would never
forgive me

Hes climbed that too often for danger of accidents said Philip

Jack was now crawling along a coping just over the farther sentry and
they watched him picking out the mortar from between two big stones
with his knife In five minutes he had it loose and grasping it with
both hands he pushed it close to the edge and then peeped over The
soldier was some yards from the plumb Jack looked down at the
shrubbery for guidance The smith raised his hand to signify patience
Jack waited Breathlessly the ambushed party watched the two soldiers
who were now talking together Would they never return to their doors
Five anxious minutes passed and then with a look round Jacks man
began to move nearer his position under the coping Once he stopped
and retracing half a step called out a facetious afterthought The
boys grunted impatiently and the blacksmith swore in his beard Then
the soldier took another step back laughing at his wit yet moving
irresolutely as though he had another word or two to add to the joke
After this his progress backwards was steady

At last when he was within a yard of the precise spot and not one of
the attacking party had a grain of patience left the smith dropped his
hand and Jack toppled the stone over the edge It fell with a terrible
swiftness the soldier completed his yard of step and the block took
him not on the crown but on the right shoulder It was however
enough Down he fell without a sound

His companion glancing up at the instant saw him fall and leaving
his matchlock ran to his assistance At the same moment the smith and
the boys rushed from the shrubbery The soldier running towards his
friend observed them approaching checked himself in bewilderment and
then swung round on his heel and made for his weapon But Matthew was
too quick for him The smith was quite twenty yards distant but
gathering himself together he flung out his arm and with all his
might threw the iron bar at the retreating sentry The missile sped
true over and over it twisted in the air and catching the soldier
with a horrid thud in the back laid him low

Hurrah cried Philip

Hurrah cried Jack peering down from the roof as the others bound
the two wounded men with ropes It was quickly done and they were
hauled into the stable and secured safely therein and old Digger told
off to watch them and mind them as well as he might

Now we can go ahead was Matthews comment grimly uttered as he
opened the door Philip was for accompanying him but Matthew said no
In a minute or two I will be back with your sister he added I want
to settle the other man alone I have a few scores to pay off

He sprang up the stairs three at a bound grasping his iron bar firmly
and at last came to Barbaras landing There before the door stood the
Roundhead who evidently had heard nothing of the disturbance below

Ha smith he cried on spying Matthew what are you looking for

I came to have a little talk said Matthew easily taking in his man
with a quick glance

Well then you had best descend those stairs again replied the
soldier Im in no mood for talking

Now thats curious said Matthew genially leaning against the wall
because I am I never felt more disposed to conversation in my life

The soldier scowled and fingered his matchlock

But perhaps Matthew continued darting forward suddenly and with a
blow of the iron bar knocking the gun from the mans handperhaps a
little tussle would be more to your liking I have a mind to smash your
face What do you say

The soldier drew his sword

No said Matthew striking it down with the bar I dont want iron
Its so noisy I have the sound of iron all day in my smithy Give me a
little change He kicked the sword along the passage and threw his
bar after it

Now said he we are equal Come

So saying the blacksmith tapped the Roundhead on the chin The soldier
made an attempt to defend himself but fisticuffs were out of his line
and Matthew had a series of easy openings The smith punished him badly
for a while and then remarking that he had set his heart on spoiling
one or two more Roundheads before he died followed the words with a
blow on the soldiers nose that laid him low

The blacksmith pulled himself together and then opening a cupboard
door near by pushed the sentry into it and turned the key

The next thing was to liberate Barbara who when she heard what had
happened asked with nice tact if Matthew did not think that they could
talk more comfortably in the kitchen and Matthew replied that his
brain was always more fertile in the presence of cold pasty and ale
than at any other time



WAS THAT ALL RIGHT GODFREY FAIRFAX ASKED GREGORY

FIRSTRATE HE SAID I CANT THINK WHY YOUR BOOKS DONT SUCCEED

PERHAPS THIS IS THE BEST OF THEM ROBERT SUGGESTED

BARBARA IS VERY BRAVE SAID JANET I ADMIRE HER TREMENDOUSLY

AND PHILIP TOO SAID HESTER

OH BUT JACK AND THE STONE IS BEST SAID GREGORY I COULD HAVE DONE
THAT

SO COULD I SAID HORACE CAMPBELL ITS JUST WHAT I WANT TO
DOTHINGS LIKE THAT

YOURE RATHER BLOODTHIRSTY LITTLE BOYS SAID GODFREY FAIRFAX
PERHAPS I HAD BETTER BEGIN AGAIN IT IS GOING TO BE QUIETER NOW


Once in the kitchen Barbara and Philip and the blacksmith took rapid
counsel together as to the best course of action It was now late in
the afternoon the Captain might be back with another bodyguard at any
time and once he returned there would be no chance of getting the
stranger away It was therefore important to furnish him with the
disguiseRuperts clothesand spirit him out of the house at once On
the other hand as he did not count upon being at sea till midnight
this would simply mean exchanging one hidingplace for another but
all things considered it was imperative that he should stay no longer
at the Hall

This decided Rupert was called in to divest himself of his clothes
and soon afterwards he sent down the bundle and with it Barbara sought
the stranger while Matthew feeling very well satisfied with the days
work sauntered to the stables to examine the wounds of the Roundhead
soldiers He found them groaning but in a way to recover and then
calling the boys he set them to prepare the horses against their
journey It was approaching evening but the month being June there
was no chance of a dark departure even if they waited as late as
halfpast eight so that one hour of leaving was almost as safe as
another

Barbara found her prisoner very tired of his confinement and very
hungry She explained the cause of her delay and leaving him to
change into the clothes as quickly as he might she hurried off for
food When she came back the young man looking for all the world like
a darker Rupert was standing in the library with his own clothes in
his hand

My brother will tell you what has been devised for you Barbara said

Thank you he replied putting out his hand Thank you sweet
preserver I shall see you again I know but it may be long very
long Will you keep this ring Show it to your father when he returns
and guard it carefully till we meet in the future Then you shall give
it me once more He slipped the ring on her finger and kissed it

A moment later he stood in the courtyard beside Ruperts horse where
the others were waiting

Heavens said Hugh to Philip whats happened to Rupe

Yes echoed Vernon whos that in old Rupes clothes

Shut up Philip hissed fixing them with a meaning glance Say
another word and Ill flay you Thats Rupert Ommaney and no one
else and I warn you to remember it

Come along Rupert he cried cheerily aloud to the stranger Its
time we were off

With that they swung into the saddle and rattled out of the courtyard
the stranger in the midst As he rounded the corner of the house he
looked back and smiled farewell to Barbara and the smith and Jack who
stood together watching the departure Barbara waved her hand and a
moment later her fugitive was out of sight


THATS NOT ALL IS IT HESTER INQUIRED ANXIOUSLY AS MISS REDSTONE
STOPPED

ISNT IT A GOOD ENDING SHE ASKED

NO SAID GREGORY OF COURSE NOT I WANT TO KNOW IF HE GOT TO THE
HARBOUR ALL RIGHT AND WHO HE WAS

OH I THINK WE KNOW WHO HE WAS JANET SAID

WHO GREGORY ASKED I DONT KNOW WELL ITS NOT THE END SAID
MISS REDSTONE BUT THE END IS VERY NEAR AND THAT WILL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING AND SHE BEGAN AGAIN


The boys and their companion had not been gone an hour when in rode the
Captain and his two soldiers with a terrible clatter The Captain
leaped from his horse and strode into the house roaring for the men
he had left on guard Barbara who was in the library with Rupert
heard the noise and divined its meaning

Rupert she said swiftly on a sudden inspiration will you add one
more kindness to your long list Will you hide in here for a few
minutes So saying she showed him the secret chamber

Rupert hesitated not a moment but swung himself up and was lost to
view The picture hardly descended when the Captain entered

Ha he cried casting a quick glance at Barbara So you have escaped
my soldiers vigilance A nice story of traitorous mutiny I shall have
to report to London Three of the Parliaments men beaten and bound
and rebels here in hiding For there is a hidingplace here I will lay
my life and by the look in your eyes mistress the bird is still in
it

So saying he set his men once more to work on the walls and himself
attacked the portrait Barbara stood by watching them After five
minutes fumbling the spring was touched The Captain leaped into the
cavity and they heard him utter a cry of triumph A moment later he
came forth leading Rupert But his expression of joy vanished when he
gained the light dim though it was and found that his captive was but
a schoolboy and a laughing one at that

Tricked again he cried as he flung the lad off and dashed from the
room

His men followed and in a moment they were all in the saddle

Barbara turned to Rupert with a smile Thank you she said

You are splendid was all he could say in reply

If you will bring me a candle said Barbara I will look at the
little room again

Bidding Rupert remain exactly where he was she entered the secret
room The Captain was too impetuous she remarked picking up a
letter addressed to herself he ought to have gone on after
discovering Rupert To Mistress Myddelton the superscription ran
and she opened it with trembling fingers

Thank you was all it said but the signature struck her dizzy It
was the signature of the exiled Prince


I KNEW IT HESTER EXCLAIMED

BUT IT DOESNT HURT THE STORY TO KNOW IT MISS REDSTONE ASKED
ANXIOUSLY

OH NO NOT AT ALL SAID JANET AND MARY PLEASE GO ON

MISS REDSTONE RESUMED


On leaving the Hall the boys and their companion had turned at once
down the highroad in the direction of Mr Fullartons at Framshott
which was precisely the opposite direction to Portallan and the sea
Philips idea being to ride for a few miles as if on the journey back
to school and to be seen by as many people who knew them by sight as
possible then to branch off into a sheltering wood wait there till
dark and start again refreshed in a beeline for the harbour In
this way the Captain would if he were to return and follow them be
put on a wrong scent and give up any chase as a waste of effort

But Barbaras trick in hiding Rupert undid the plan for the first
person whom the Captain and his men met on leaving the Hall for the
second time swore so positively to having seen the FOUR schoolboys that
the Roundheads suspicions were at once aroused and turning his
horses head he led the way at all speed towards Portallan

Then there was a man there all the time he cried bitterly to
himself and he has escaped in that puppys clothes Sdeath if I
catch him now He ground his teeth together in his rage and dug
the rowels of his spurs into the horses side Without another word
they rode at the gallop through the growing darkness

The boys were riding together at a good swinging pace the stranger in
Ruperts clothes leading the way by a neck Philip beside him and the
other two behind It was not a dark night but a mist rolling inland
from the seaone of those white mists well known along the south
coast which predicate hot weatherenveloped them impenetrably except
at very short range

Halt they heard the Captain cry halfway down the hill

Ay it is likely we shall halt for that said the stranger with a
laugh Ill show him and turning in his saddle he discharged a
pistol down the road Thats for our enemies he remarked grimly
and may it hit someone

A few moments later came an answering shot whistling past their heads
ominously

Break for the nearest copse replied the stranger promptly for a
council of war Quick nows the time The top of the hill is cover for
us So saying he put his horse to the bank cleared it and galloped
over the field to the trees which loomed grey and indefinite before
them

The others followed In two minutes they were under the boughs Not
daring to breathe they heard the troopers thunder along the highroad
all unconscious for the moment of the trick that had been played them

Now said the stranger briefly we must divide I shall proceed to
Portallan alone very warily

The faces of the boys fell at these words Relinquish their duty before
a blow had been struck It was humiliatingimpossible Philip first
found voice No sir he cried emphatically nothing of the kind My
sister bade me not leave your side until you embarked for France and
her word is my law

And we stand by Phil said Vernon with equal emphasis

You are brave boys the stranger answered but you must do tonight
as I say There is no time to argue here and if I miss the tide I am
undone for loyal captains are rare birds I promise you There may be
not another safe ship this fortnight

But the enemy said Philipyou will have to pass them How can you
do that singlehanded

Besides Hugh interpolated is it fair to rob us of our sport like
this

Yes said Vernon supporting him it is seldom enough one has any
chance of striking a blow for the cause We are well armed We are four
to their three

The young man made a gesture of impatience

Peace he said I have told you we must separate let that be final
You Philip shall accompany me part of the way at any rateI owe you
that but the others will ride each towards the sea by different but
fairly direct ways They will probably each be pursued but must do the
best they can avoiding bloodshed if possible The captain has two men
with him and Vernon and Hugh must each decoy one of them away in
pursuit That will leave merely the captain who is certain to ride to
the port You Philip will divert him and the way will thus be clear
and open to me to get on board Please God we all get through safely

So saying the stranger shook hands with Hugh and Vernon who were
convinced by something in his voice that this was their master and
nothing more was to be said and in a moment he and Philip were gone

Events happened precisely as the stranger had foretold Vernon and
Hugh riding full tilt towards Portallan attracted each a Roundhead
soldier and each boy used his knowledge of the country to lead the men
a wildgoose chase Vernons pursuer succumbed first for he and his
horse fell into a small but sufficient chalkpit a mile or two from
Framshott just as dawn was breaking As for Hughs man after three
hours zigzag riding through the mist he was deftly persuaded to gallop
into the Worminglore bog and there Hugh flinging a parting word of
derision left him floundering The man fired a bullet in the direction
of the boys voice but it did no harm except to his hat and only
served to increase Hughs reputation among his companions at school as
a desperate fellow It is not every boy who has a bullethole in his
hat

Meanwhile Philip and the stranger spurred to the sea by a devious
course They rode silently the strangers hand alert to seize his
pistol Suddenly when only a mile or two from the harbour a light or
two being visible on the ships riding at anchor he reined in with a
jerk before a shepherds hut which stood at the edge of a sheepfold on
the naked down a yard from the road

Just the thing he cried we have still an hour

Bidding Philip stay there and keep watch he leaped from his horse and
opened the door of the hut

Whos there growled the voice of the shepherd

A friend if you hold your peace said the young man otherwise a
foe and a strong one I can promise you He clicked a pistol as he
spoke and the shepherd stood up and pulled his forelock

I want no words said the stranger and no delay Do as I tell you
in the Kings name

Ay marry cried the shepherd in the Kings name Ill do anything

Good fellow said the stranger well said Take off that smock and
those legcasings

The man took them off The stranger divested himself of Ruperts
clothes at the same time and hastily donned those of the shepherd
Tie mine in a bundle he said to the man I shall leave you cold
tonight I fear but here is money Lie close in a blanket till the
morrow and then send for your wife to buy other clothes But keep your
tongue from wagging

So saying the stranger shouldered his bundle and taking the
shepherds crook in his hand he left the hut and rejoined Philip My
dear boy he said I must leave you now I shall creep into the town
under cover of this disguise safely enough and be on board in half an
hour Farewell I shall never forget your services to me as you will
be reminded some day and from a quarter you least expect With these
words he shook the boys hand and was lost in the mist

Philip waited irresolutely for some minutes Then a plan came to him
which if successful would make the humiliation of the Roundhead
complete Yes he said Ill do it and forthwith he urged his horse
towards the town at a smart trot leading the other by the reins and
talking loudly with its imaginary rider The ruse was successful The
Roundhead Captain was as Philip had suspected in ambush just at the
outskirts all ready to dart forth and at last make the capture When
within a dozen yards of his form dimly outlined in the fog Philip
loosed the led horse and lashing it sharply over the flanks turned
his own steed and rode off at full gallop which he did not slacken
till he reached home He glowed as he rode

Barbaras head appeared at the window in response to his clatter
Calling the single word Safe from the gate he spurred on to
Framshott

Outwitted clean said the Captain to himself as he came up at last
with the riderless animal two hours after Outwitted discredited and
by a parcel of children However lets make the best of it and so
saying he urged his horse towards Myddelton Hall leading the
strangers by the bridle

At three in the morning when the sun was rising and the air was sweet
and cool and songs of birds made music all around him Philip rode
into the yard of the schoolhouse He found Rupert waiting for him

Hugh and Vernon are in the kitchen making a famine said Master
Ommaney Old Fulls down there with them and hes as pleased as a
Merry Andrew about it all He keeps shaking hands with us

Its been grand said Philip as he shut the stable door on his
horse Im so sorry you couldnt come too Rupe old boy

At about the same time the Captain thundered on the Hall door The
blacksmith very deliberately descended the stairs to unlock it Barbara
followed

You must give me lodging tonight the Captain said curtly My men
will be here soon and there are three good fellows to be cared for to
whom your servants have done serious mischief

Barbara looking contrite told the Captain that a room was at his
service and there was food in the kitchen He attended first to his
horse and then she set a brave supper before him and the smith

Well young lady said the Captain at length I must compliment you
on your cleverness You nested your bird well and you saw to it that
he flew well too All we have to show for it is a broken nose a
broken shoulder and a broken back It is a sad business for us all
bad for you when head quarters come to hear of it and bad for me in
not being sharper But it might have been worse he added why the
fugitive might have been the Prince himself instead of this
twopennyhalfpenny spy Barbara smiled

    

In conclusion it may be said that as it turned out no more was heard
of the matter by Colonel Myddelton The Roundhead Captain felt that the
days work did not sufficiently redound to his credit and he shrank
from the chaff that would follow when it was known that a girl and some
schoolboys had outwitted him He therefore kept silence

Some years had to pass before Barbara and Philip received their reward
but one of the first acts of the Merry Monarch on ascending the throne
was to make Philip a knight and to send Barbara a pair of very
beautiful horses and a carriage


THERE WAS A SILENCE AFTER GODFREY FAIRFAX HAD FINISHED

SEND YOU THE STORY WHEN IT IS PRINTED

AND AFTER GIVING HER THEIR ADDRESS THEY RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY AND
DISCUSSED THE ROMANCE AT INTERVALS ALL THE WAY TO BREDON HILL



CHAPTER 15

THE ADVENTURE OF THE RUNAWAY PONIES

The distance from Evesham to Elmley Castle a little village under
Bredon Hill is only five or six miles and the Slowcoaches were
comfortably encamped in a field there by six oclock for at Evesham
they did no more than walk through the churchyard to the beautiful
square Bell Tower with its little company of spires on the roof Mary
bought a guide at a shop at the corner of the marketplace and read the
story

This Bell Tower with a gateway and a wall or so is all that remains
of a Benedictine abbey which was built by the Bishop of Worcester in
the reign of Ethelred The Bishop it seems had a swineherd named
Eoves who one day while wandering in the Forest of Arden In which
the scene of As You Like It is laid Hester and which used to cover
all the ground where Evesham now stands was visited in a vision by
three radiant damsels He returned at once and told the Bishop who on
being led to the same spot after a preparation of fasting and prayer
had the same vision and at once recognized the damsels as the Virgin
Mary and two Angels

At that time the meaning of such heavenly visitations was plain and
the Bishop at once set about building an abbey on the spot He
appointed himself the first abbot and named it after his swineherd
EovesEovesham

The abbey was large and prosperous but the Danes destroyed it in one
of their raids and it had to be rebuilt on a more splendid scale Then
came Henry VIII and his quarrel with the Church of Rome and the abbey
was confiscated and given as a grant to Sir Philip Hoby one of his
friends who at once being a man of the type of the Rev Francis
Gastrell raised what money he could on it by turning it into a quarry
for stones And that is why so many old houses in this neighbourhood
have carved stones in their walls

The party then returned to the marketplace and walked down to the
bridge where they joined Kink and set out for their goal

Elmley Castle is one street with a ruined cross at one end and the
church at the other and the great hill over all The cottages are as
white as snowdrops and they have heavy thatch roofs The women wear
large blue Worcestershire sunbonnets The only shop is a postoffice
too so that Robert was able to send his telegrams very easily

After supper some of them walked through the churchyard which has a
very curious sundial in it to the meadows beyond in search of the
castle the site of which is mentioned on the map but is quite
undiscoverable now while Robert made friends with an old labourer
smoking his pipe outside the great tithe barn and asked him about the
road up Bredon as it was his project to sleep on the very top of the
hill the next night

But the old man changed their plans completely for he convinced Robert
that the Slowcoach would never get to the top without at least two more
horses to help and even then it would be an unwise course to take
because there was no proper road and it might be badly shaken

It was therefore arranged that the older and stronger children should
take their lunch to the top of the hill and eat it there and that
Kink with Hester and Gregory should go round the hill which rises
all alone from the plain like a great sleeping monster on the flat
roads and meet them on the other or south side at Beckford in the
afternoon and they should then go on for five or six miles farther to
their campingground near Oxenton

The night was uneventful except for a rather startling visit from a
peacock which stood just inside the boys tent and uttered such sounds
as only a peacock can

Both parties started early the next morning Gregory and Hester being
for the first time alone as owners of the Slowcoach were very proud
and excited and Gregory insisted upon Janet giving him two shillings
in case of any emergency although Kink had plenty of money The nice
old women in the Worcestershire sunbonnets came to see them start and
well supplied with stone gingerbeer from the Queens HeadQueen
Elizabeths head as it happensoff they went Gregory beside Kink
and Hester inside reading Hans Andersens story of the nightingale

The others after waving goodbye set their feet bravely towards the
slopes of Bredon Hillno small undertaking for it is very steep and
the day was hot But the pathway is pleasant first passing by the
gardens of the great house where burning blue on the wall they saw
their visitor of the night and then through a deep lane to a hillocky
meadow and so up to the turf of the higher slopes where the views
begin and where it is very agreeable to rest

But Robert urged them on It is quite flat at the top he said and
there is a tower at the very edge and a perfect place for a picnic

Here we will leave them climbing pantingly up and follow the
Slowcoach as Moses drew it steadily along the lanes at the base of the
hill between the high hedges At first as I said Kink and Gregory
walked but after a while they both sat in front just over the shafts
and Gregory held the reins he called it driving and they discussed
lifewhich means that Gregory asked a thousand questions and Kink did
his best to answer or ignore them

Its not true is it that when all the cows in a field stand up its
going to rain

Dont you think Bredon Hill would be a ripping place to start to fly
from

Shall we stop and cook our dinner or have cold things

Its not true is it that whenever you see a white horse you see a
redhaired girl I suppose that means only in London where there are
so many people

Do you know that you cant walk over London Bridge without seeing a
white horse

Do you think that Moses is ever going to have a stone in his shoe so
that I can get it out with my knife Couldnt we drive him over a very
stony place

You cant really tell the time by dandelions can you

And so forth till Kinks head would have ached if he had not trained
it not to

Gregory was rattling on in this way when suddenly they heard a
screaming and scrambling and thudding behind them and a moment later a
chaise with a little girl in it drawn by a pair of grey ponies dashed
past at a fearful pace only just avoiding the caravan and disappeared
in a cloud of dust and then after a minute or so came a tremendous
shattering crash and all was still

Its a smashup said Kink urging Moses into a trot We must help
them and at the same time Hesters white face appeared at the window
and implored Kink to drive faster

In a minute or so they saw a moving mass at the side of the road which
they knew to be the broken chaise and a farm labourer holding the head
of the one pony that was on its feet Kink tied Moses to a gatepost
and ran to the mans help telling the children to wait a moment Both
were rather frightened and they stood hand in hand by Moses and
watched

They saw Kink lift something from the chaise and lay it on the grass
Then they saw him hacking at the harness with his pruningknife until
the pony was free when the man led it to another gatepost and tied it
there Then Kink hacked again and drew the carriage away from the pony
that was lying on the ground and then he and the man lifted the bundle
once more and came with it very carefully to the Slowcoach Kink
calling out to Gregory to open the door and put some pillows on the
floor

When Kink and the man reached the Slowcoach Hester saw that they were
carrying a girl of about her own age who was lying in their arms quite
still with her eyes closed

They placed her gently on the cushions and Kink dashed a little water
on her face

After a moment or so she opened her eyes and asked where she was

Youre all right said Hester Youve had an accident Were taking
care of you

Then the little girl remembered The ponies she cried Are they
hurt

Im afraid one of them is said Kink But never mind now The great
thing is that you werent thrown out Keep quiet now missie and well
look after everything

But the little girl would not be silenced

Which one is hurt she asked Which one Is it Marshall or
Snelgrove

I dont know said Kink Theyre both alike

Oh no theyre not said the little girl Marshall has a white star
between his eyes Oh do say Marshalls all right Marshalls my very
own

Ill go and see said Gregory and he ran off and came back to say
that Marshall was the one that seemed to be all right but Snelgrove
had broken his leg and couldnt move

Oh Im so glad about Marshall said the girl but poor Tommy how
sorry hell be

See if you can get up missie said Kink I want to know if youre
hurt anywhere

The little girl sat up and then stood up I feel all right she said
only very giddy

Kink uttered a sigh of relief Drink this cold water he said That
will make you much better And now tell us all about the accident
because we shall have to let your people know

Well said the little girl mother and I were driving to Ashton to
see Aunt May and mother had just got out to leave the _British
Workman_ at old Mr Dimmocks when the ponies took fright and ran
away I held the reins as long as I could and when I saw your caravan
in front I screamed to warn you and then there was a terrible crash
and I dont remember anything else

And what will your poor mamma be doing said Kink

Oh poor mother said the little girl Shell be so nervous But
shell be coming after us as fast as she can because she saw them
start off

Then I think said Kink the best thing to do is for us to leave
this man here to mind the ponies and tell your mamma youre all right
and well go on to Ashton as quick as we can and send back some help
Well take you to your aunts missie and the man will tell your mamma
when she comes up what weve done Im so glad youre not hurt

So Hester and Gregory were left with the little girl who told them her
name was Patricia Mordan and she was ten and they lived near
Fladbury and she had a King Charles spaniel while Kink urged Moses
towards Ashton which was only a mile or so away

Hester put the kettle on the Beatrice stove thinking that tea was the
best thing and Gregory sat down and looked at their guest and thought
what a splendid adventure it was to tell the others about when they met
them later

Patricia who was now in a deckchair examined the caravan in a kind
of ecstasy What a lovely place it is she said Do you really live
here How scrumptiously exciting

My beds over there said Gregory

Where do you stop at night Patricia asked

I have to go to the farmers and get leave to camp on their land said
Gregory

And is it just you two and the driver Patricia asked

Oh no said Gregory there are five others but they are walking
over Bredon Hill They said we could not walk so far which is rot of
course but Im glad we didnt because then we shouldnt have been
here to save your life

Mother will be very grateful to you for being so kind said Patricia
Poor mother shell be so frightened about me And Tommyhow dreadful
for him to lose Snelgrove

Whos Tommy Gregory asked

Tommys my brother said Patricia Hes twelve Aunt May gave
Snelgrove to him and Marshall to me last Christmas Theyve never run
away before I wish we had a caravan

Caravans are very jolly said Gregory Things are always happening
too

Id rather have a sweet grey pony than a caravan said Hester
bringing a cup of tea



CHAPTER 16

THE BLACK SPANIELS

Gregory who was looking out of the door and meditating an escape from
so much dampness and a conversation on the whole matter with Kink
exclaimed suddenly Hello I guess this is your mother

Yes it is cried Patricia standing up and waving her handkerchief
to a lady seated in a milkcart which was being driven after them at a
tremendous pace I wondered who shed get to bring her here and its
young Daniel Wilson Tell your man to stop please

Mrs Mordan whom Gregory thought both a nice and a pretty lady leapt
out of the milkcart and ran up the steps of the Slowcoach and mother
and daughter hugged each other for quite two minutes while Gregory
looked at young Daniel Wilson and Patricia began to cry afreshthis
time because she was happy

Mrs Mordan was happy too The grief she had felt for the accident and
the injury to poor Snelgrove whom she had left in agony by the road
passed away when she found her little daughter unhurt

She sat holding Patricias hand and asked Hester a number of
questions and gave her a number of thanks all together

Gregory meanwhile had got out and was asking young Daniel Wilson how
ponies are shot and what he did about getting milk to the station when
the snow was two feet thick and if the cows often kicked the buckets
over

Its not us said Hester its Kink who was so useful

Who is Kink Mrs Mordan asked

Our gardener said Hester but he drives the caravan for us and
gradually she told the whole Slowcoach story

By this time they were at Ashton and after giving instructions about
looking after the poniessending for a veterinary surgeon and so
forthMrs Mordan showed Kink the way to Aunt Mays house which they
reached just before two

Aunt May was standing by the gate with five black spaniels about her
looking anxiously down the roada tall lady with grey hair and
topboots and a little whip in her hand

No she said as Kink stopped at the gate I dont want any chairs
or kettles mended or indeed anything from you at all

Kink however said nothing but went to the back of the caravan and
helped Mrs Mordan and Patricia down

My precious Lina exclaimed Aunt May when she saw them Whatever
has happened

Ill tell you about it indoors said Mrs Mordan These kind people
are going to stop here for lunch if youve got enough

Of course theres enough said Aunt May but I thought you were
gipsies or tinkers or something objectionable Youre not a tinker
are you she said to Gregory

No he said but Id like to be a gypsy

And so they reached the house which was an oldfashioned one all
among dark trees with a very soft lawn in front of it

Aunt May told Kink to go round to the back and be sure not to let
Diogenes and the dogs fight and then she began to call at the top of
her voice for Simpkins

After a while Simpkins appearedan elderly bald man in a dress suit
who was evidently the butler

Simpkins said Aunt May there will be two more to lunch and
theres a caravan at the back belonging to this gentleman
hereindicating Gregory who immediately grew three inches all
overand please give the driver a good dinner

Yes my lady said Simpkins and Hester and Gregory at once began to
look at her with round eyes for they had never before met anyone who
was titledI mean to speak to although they had seen the Lord Mayor
who is of course a baronet in his carriage only last November 9

And Simpkins said Aunt May take Mr What is your name she asked
Gregory

Gregory Bruce Avory said he

Take Mr Bruce Avory to the Pink Room and get him some hot water

Yes my lady said Simpkins and Gregory grew another inch all over

And then Aunt May led the others upstairs

Gregory finished his washing first and walked to the diningroom
which opened on to the lawn and was very bright and sweetsmelling
The walls were covered with pictures and there were roses in blue
bowls wherever a place could be found for them

By the wall in a row were five round baskets and directly Aunt May
came in the five black spaniels who were with her went each to his
basket and lay there quietly with his head resting on the edge and
his eyes fixed on his mistress Their names were Mars Saturn Orion
Mercury and Jupiter and from time to time Aunt May called one to her
and gave it a little piece of food while the others glittered with
expectation

Now said Aunt May lets get on with our eatin for Im sure
youre all hungry and I know I am Patricia dear do you think you can
eat solid things or shall we get something else

Patricia however declared that she could eat anything

Mr Bruce Avory said Aunt May youre drinkin nothing Would you
rather have lemonade or barleywater

Poor Gregory he knew what he wantedlemonadebut he didnt know
whether he ought to address Aunt May as My Lady or Your Ladyship or
Lady Rusper He had tried to get a moment with Hester to ask about
it but without success

If she was only our aunt he thought and then said without using
any name at all that he would like lemonade

Lady Rusper made them tell her the story all through once again right
from the beginnin as she called it and just as Hester had got to
the end of her part of it a boy arrived leading Marshall and Patricia
leaped up and rushed across the lawn to fondle her pony Then she
dashed back for a piece of sugar and was off again The boy said that
the blacksmith who was also a farrier had seen Marshall and declared
he was quite sound but Snelgrove was done for completely and the trap
was too badly smashed ever to be much use

Put Marshall in the stable said Aunt May and have the trap brought
here

At the news about Snelgrove Patricia began to cry again

Well said Aunt May we must see what can be done I dare say there
are more ponies in the world But I suppose we shall all be driven to
motors before long Its a great shame I spend most of my time
detestin the things but theyve got to come And now she said to
Hester tell me all about your home and your caravan and Hester
again told the story saying Lady Rusper with an ease that made
Gregory gasp

After lunch they all went to the stables where in a loosebox
beautifully snug in the straw lay another black spaniel Venus with
three puppies Oh the darlings cried Hester snuggling to her

Do you think your mother would let you keep a spaniel Aunt May asked

Oh yes now weve got Diogenes as a start she answered

Very well then said Aunt May if youd like one of these you
shall have it directly its old enough to be sent awayas a memory of
today and as a thankofferin too Which would you like she added
Psyche Cicero or Circe This is Cicero this is Circe and this is
Psyche

Why do all their names begin with S Gregory asked and it was not
till he told Janet about it that he understood why it was that everyone
had laughed so

And if you may keep two Aunt May went on speaking to Gregory I
shall send you one of the next litter Vesta is going to have puppies
soon You must write and let me know And now if your man has
finished I expect youd like to be gettin on or the others will be
nervous about you

And so after Hester had chosen Circe they all said very affectionate
farewells and the Slowcoach rumbled forth again

Meanwhile what of Janet and Robert and Mary and Jack and Horace They
had had no adventures at allnothing but scenery and a pleasant picnic

Robert had been rightly told about the summit of Bredon Hill for there
the grass is as short as on the South Downs and there is a deep fosse
in which to shelter from the wind

The hill at this western point ends suddenly at a kind of precipice
and you look right over the valley of the Avon and the Severn to the
Malverns Just below on the southwest is Tewkesbury where the Severn
and the Avon meet after that becoming the Severn only all the way to
Bristol and the sea In the far southwest rises the point of the Sugar
Loaf at Abergavenny and the blue distance is Walesthe country of
King Arthur and Malory

To the northwest is the smoke of Worcester and immediately beneath
the hill winding shiningly about is the Avon running by Bredon
village and the Combertons and Pershore past Cropthorne where Mr
MacAngus was perhaps even now painting and Wood Norton where the Duke
of Orleans who ought Hester held to be King of France today lives
to Evesham and the weir where they had rowed about and so on to
Stratford

Roberts maps fortified by what he had picked up from the old man last
night told them all these things and told them also more or less
what the coloured counties were that they could see for of course
Mary wanted to know that Warwickshire Gloucestershire Oxfordshire
Worcestershire Herefordshire Monmouthshire After lunch Mary sang the
beautiful Bredon Hill song to them and so they descended to the level
ground and to Kink and Hester and Gregory little expecting to find
them with such exciting things to tell

From Beckford to Oxenton the great story lasted eked out with
questions and answers as it proceeded Thus Horace wanted to know why
Kink had not sprung to the horses heads and checked them in their wild
career

We couldnt see them said Gregory they were coming up behind and
we were sitting in front

Horace was dissatisfied

What frightened them Jack wanted to know but Gregory could not say
Patricia had not explained

Fancy not knowing what frightened them said Jack

The fact was that both Jack and Horace were a little overtired and
perhaps a little jealous of the eventfulness of the Slowcoachs day

They had been talking so hard that they had not noticed the sky and
the splashing of raindrops was the first knowledge they had that a
storm was coming It was nearly seven and suddenly they all knew that
they were very tired and hungry and rather chilly Kink stopped Moses
and suggested camping at once

Where said Robert

Here said Kink Under these trees Therell be a downpour soon
better get your supper at once

They therefore did not make any effort to find a farm but instantly
unpacked Hitherto everything had gone smoothly but this was a bad
evening Nothing seemed to be in its place and Hester whose duty it
was to get enough dry wood had forgotten all about it and by the time
a new bundle could be brought it was damp Then the matches blew out
and then when at last the fire was alight the wind scattered the
flames so that there was no heat under the pot for more than a moment
at a time This often happens when you are on caravan excursions

Mary had arranged for a stew but she soon discovered that there was no
chance of its being done for hours unless it could be moved into the
Slowcoach and cooked over the Beatrice stove but when they got
Beatrice out she was found to be empty and no more oil was in the can

Who is the Keeper of the Oil Mary asked severely

I am said Jack

Then where is it they asked

I had it filled at Stratford said Jack Why he exclaimed
theres a hole in it Its all run away How ghastly It will be all
over everything

And so it was and the worst of it was that it had leaked into the
biscuits too Janet came to the rescue We must make it a tongue and
banana meal she said

I hate bananas said Gregory

Now Horace said Janet wheres the tinopener

How is it that everything goes wrong at once Horace had to hunt for
the tinopener for twenty minutes and turn the whole place upside down
before he could find it and then it was too late

Meanwhile the rain was steadily falling and Kink and Robert were busy
getting up the tents before the ground underneath was too wet Robert
was the only happy one A few difficulties seemed to him to make the
expedition more real

He came dripping into the Slowcoach and asked for his supper but
Horace was still hunting for the tinopener

Never mind about it said Robert Ill open the thing with the
hammer and a knife But what you want Horace is system

No what I want is food said Horace Im dying

So am I said Gregory

Well eat a crust to go on with said Janet Theres the bread

I hate crusts said Gregory

Surely crusts are better than dying of starvation said Mary

No said Gregory who was prepared to be thoroughly unpleasant No
Id much rather die I think I shall go to bed

Yes said Robert do People who cant stand a little hunger are no
good in caravans

Janet said Gregory how can I go to bed with my boots on

Then take them off said Janet

Theres a knot said Gregory

Well you must wait said Janet I cant leave what Im doing

I hate waiting said Gregory

Robert however became suddenly very stern He advanced on Gregory
with a knife in his hand and swooping on the boot cut both laces
There he said get into bed and you must buy some more laces at
Cheltenham

I hate Cheltenham said Gregory But he said no more he saw that
Robert was cross

When a little later Janet took a plate of tongue over to his bunk he
was fast asleep The others had a dismal grumpy meal and they were
glad when the washingup was done and it was bedtime But no one had a
good night The rain dropped from the trees on to the Slowcoachs roof
with loud thuds and at midnight the thunder and lightning began and
Janet got up and splashed out in the wet to the tent to ask Robert if
they ought not to move from under the trees Robert had been lying
awake thinking the same thing but Kink had gone off with Moses to the
nearest farm and the Slowcoach was far too heavy to move without the
horse Diogenes whimpered on his chain If he could have spoken he
would have said like Gregory I hate thunder

Perhaps it wont get very near us said Robert We must chance it
anyway

But neither he nor Janet had any sleep until it was nearly time to get
up when the sun began to shine again and the miseries of the evening
and night before were forgotten

Hester however had slept all through it and had dreamed that ponies
were running away with her towards a country entirely peopled by black
spaniels and governed by a grey queen in topboots

As for Gregory his dream was that he was Lord Bruce



CHAPTER 17

THE ADVENTURE OF THE LOST BABY

They entered Cheltenham at about halfpast eleven and were having
lunch on the top of Leckhampton Hill on the other side of it by
halfpast one Robert had not allowed any stop in Cheltenham except for
shopping We dont want towns he said except historic ones

But this is historic said Jack Jessop was at school here

The pull up Leckhampton Hill was very stiff and they were all glad to
take lunch easily and since Robert had arranged a short dayonly
three or four miles more to a very nicelooking spot on the other side
of Birdlipthey rested with clear consciences and as it happened
rested again in the Birdlip Hotel where they had tea in the garden
overlooking the Severn Valley on the top of just such a precipice as
Bredon

It was halfpast three before they started again on their next five
miles and they had done about three of them and had just passed
Teddington when Gregory who was walking with Kink beside Moses
suddenly dashed ahead towards a bundle which was lying in the middle of
the road

He bent down over it and then began to shriek for the others to come
too

What is it cried Jack as they raced up

Its a baby Gregory said wild with excitement A real baby

Janet who had been behind sprang forward as she heard these
remarkable words and easily reached the bundle first

So it is she exclaimed picking it tenderly up and opening the wraps
round its face

It was a swarthy mite very tightly bound into its clothes

What an extraordinary thing said Mary Fancy finding a baby on the
road

It has probably been abandoned said Hester Very likely it is of
noble birth and was stolen by gipsies and stained brown and now they
are afraid of pursuit and have left it

How could it be of noble birth Gregory asked Look how hideous it
is

Looks have nothing to do with high lineage said Hester There have
been very ugly kings

It isnt hideous said Janet Its a perfect darling But what are
we to do with it

If its a boy said Gregory lets keep it and make it into a
longstop We want one badly Gregory as I have said hated
fielding

Lets adopt it said Hester Mother often says how she wishes we
were still babies

Dont lets adopt it if its a girl said Gregory

It doesnt matter what a baby is said Hesterwhether its a boy
or a girl The important thing is that its a baby When it gets too
big we can let it go

Im dreadfully afraid said Janet that we shall have to try to find
out whose it is and give it back now

Well said Mary we neednt try too hard need we

How are you going to try anyway Jack asked with some scorn You
cant stop everyone you see and say Have you lost a baby This old
man just coming along for instance

Wouldnt a good way said Robert be to write a little placard

 FOUND A BABY
 Inquire Within

and stick it on the caravan

They liked that idea but Janet suggested that it would be best to ask
Kink first

Theres only one thing to do said Kink and that is to hand it over
to the police at the next place we come to

Police again said Horace Youre always talking of the police

Well said Kink thats what theyre for And if you think a moment
or two youll all see what a trouble a baby would be We shall reach
Oxenton in a little while and we can leave the baby there

But as it happened they had no need to for there suddenly appeared
before them a caravan covered with baskets which was being urged
towards them by a young woman who tugged at the horses head in a kind
of frenzy As she drew nearer they could hear that she was wailing

It must be her baby said Janet holding the bundle up but the woman
did not see it and Janet told Jack to run on quickly and meet her and
tell her that they had the baby and it was not hurt

Jack did so and the woman left the horse to be cared for by the man
and boy who walked behind and ran to Janet and seized the bundle from
her and hugged it so tightly that the baby for the first time
uttered a little cry

Where did you find it the gipsy woman asked and Janet told her the
story

It must have rolled out of the van while I was in front with the
horse said the gipsy We didnt miss it Weve had to come back
three miles at least

By this time the two caravans had met and the man was brought up by
the woman and told the story and they all expressed their gratitude to
Janet for nursing the child so kindly

Bless your pretty heart the gipsy woman said again and again while
her husband asked if there was anything that they could do for her and
her party

I dont think so said Janet We liked to take care of it of
course

The gipsy man asked a number of questions about the Slowcoach and then
suggested that he should show them a good place to camp and make their
fire for them and he added Ill tell you whatyou all come and have
supper with us Ill bet youve talked about playing at gipsies often
enough well well get a real gipsy suppera slapup one Whats the
time

He looked at the sun Nearly five Well well have supper at
halfpast seven and well do you proud Will you come

Janet considered

Of course Janet said Robert

Why dont you say yes said Gregory

Hester shrank a little towards the Slowcoach and Janet went to talk to
Kink

She came back and thanked the gipsy but said that they would not all
come but the boys would gladly do so

Im sorry you wont be there said the man But well give the young
gents a square mealand tasty too Something to relish What do you
say now he asked Gregory to a hedgehog I dont expect youve ever
eaten that

Hedgehog said Gregory No but Ive always wanted to And in
fact he had been thinking of nothing else for the last five minutes

You shall have it said the man Baked or stewed

Which is best Gregory asked

Stewed said the man But if youd like it bakedOr Ill tell you
Well have one of each We got two today This shall be a banquet

The gipsies really were very grateful folk The boy got wood for them
the man made their firemuch better than it had ever been made
beforeand lit it without any paper and with only one match

It was at last arranged that they should all share the same supper
although the woman should sit with the girls and the boys with the man
And so they did and they found the hedgehog very good especially the
baked one which had been enclosed in a mould of clay and pushed right
into the middle of the fire It tasted a little like pork only more
delicate

When you invited us to come to supper Robert said you asked what
the time was and then looked at the sun and said it was nearly five
And it wasalmost exactly How do you do that

Ah said the gipsy I cant explain There it is I know by the sun
but I cant teach you because you must live out of doors and never
have a clock or its no good

And can you tell it when theres no sun Robert asked

Pretty well said the man

How lucky you are said Horace

Well I dont know said the man What about rain When its raining
hard and were huddling in the van and cant get any dry sticks for
the fire and our feet are soaked what are you doing Why youre all
snug in your houses with a real roof over you

Id much rather live in a caravan than a house said Horace

The man laughed Youre a young gent out for a spree he said You
dont count You wonder at me he continued being able to tell the
time by the skies But I dare say theres one at any rate of you who
can find a train in that thing they call Bradshaw isnt there

I can said Robert

Well there you are said the gipsy Whats luck Nothing
Everyones got a little No ones got much

Oh but the millionaires said Horace

Millionaires said the gipsy Why you dont think theyre lucky do
you

I always have done so said Horace

Go on said the gipsy Why were luckier than what they are Weve
got enough to eat and drinkand no one wants moreand along with it
no rent and taxes no servants no tall hats no offices no
motorcars no fear of thieves Millionaires have no rest at all No
sitting under a tree by the fire smoking a pipe

And no hedgehogs said Gregory

Nono hedgehogs Nothing but butchers meat that costs its weight in
gold Take my advice young gents said the gipsy and never envy
anybody

Meanwhile the others were very happy by the Slowcoach fire The gipsy
woman hugging her baby kept as close to Janet as if she were a
spaniel Their name was Lee she said and they made baskets They
lived at Reading in the winter and were on the road all the rest of the
year The young boy was her brother His name was Keziah Her husbands
name was Jasper The babys was Rhoda

Hester was very anxious to ask questions about kidnapping but she did
not quite like to and was in fact silent

The gipsy woman noticed it after a while and remarked upon it That
little dark one there she said why doesnt she speak

Janet said something about Hester being naturally quiet and thoughtful

Oh no said the woman I know what it is shes frightened of me
Shes heard stories about the gipsies stealing children and staining
their faces with walnut juice havent you dearie

Hester admitted it

There said the woman laughing triumphantly But dont be
frightened dearie she added Thats only stories And even if it
ever did happen it couldnt again what with railway trains and
telegraphs and telephones and motorcars and newspapers How could we
help being found out Why she continued so far from stealing
children there was a boy running away from school once who offered us
a pound to let him join our caravan and stain his face and go with us
to Bristol where he could get on to a ship as a stowaway as he called
it but Jasper wouldnt let him I wanted to but Jasper was dead
against it No he said gipsies have a bad enough time as it is
without getting into trouble helping boys to run away from school
That shows what we are dearie she added to Hester with a smile

And dont you ever tell fortunes Hester asked

I wont say Ive never done that the gypsy said

Wont you tell mine Hester asked Ive got a sixpence

Just cross my hand with it said the woman but dont give it to me
I couldnt take money from any of you

So Hester with her heart beating very fast crossed the gipsys hand
with the sixpence and the gipsy held both hers and peered at them very
hard while Janet nursed the baby

This said the gipsy at last is a very remarkable hand I see
stories and people reading them I see a dark gentleman and a gentleman
of middling colour

Yes said Hester Cant you tell me anything more about them

Well said the gipsy I cant because they are only little boys
just now But I see a beautiful wedding White satin Flowers
Bridesmaids

The gipsy stopped and Hester drew her hand back It was terribly
romantic and exciting

Before the woman said good night and went to her caravan Hester took
her sixpence to Kink and asked him to bore a hole in it And then she
threaded it on a piece of string and tied it round the babys neck

The gipsy woman was very grateful A beautiful wedding she said
again Such flowers Music too

Wasnt it wonderful Hester said to Janet before they went to sleep

What Janet asked

The gipsy knowing I was fond of writing

No said Janet it wasnt wonderful at all There was a great ink
stain on your finger



CHAPTER 18

THE ADVENTURE OF THE OLD IRISHWOMAN

When they awoke the next morning the gipsies had gonenothing remained
of them but the burnt circle on the ground which any encampment makes
and a little rubbish but at the mouth of the boys tent lay a bundle
of sticks and two rabbits

Kink looked at the rabbits with a narrow eye Better hurry up and get
them eaten he said or one of those policemen that Master Campbell
is so fond of may be asking awkward questions And it wouldnt be a bad
thing Kink added to have a good look round and see if theres
anything missing

Oh Kink said Janet how horrid you are to be so suspicious And
after all their gratitude too

Yes said Kink but gipsies is gipsies They were gipsies before
they were grateful and I reckon theyll be gipsies after

But in spite of his examination he found no signs of any theft

They were away soon after breakfast which seemed a little flat at
first after the excitement of last night But they soon lost that
feeling in hunger It was a very windy day with showers now and then
but it was bracing too especially on this very high road hundreds of
feet above the sealevel

Robert pointed out how straight it was and told them it was made by
the Romans eighteen hundred years ago and it ran right through
Cirencester which they called Corinium to Speen which they called
Spinae Its name was then Ermin Street And it amused the children to
imagine they too were Romans clanking along this fine highway

It was after lunch that they came upon an old womansitting beside the
road just beyond Tredington Long before they reached her they heard
her moaning and groaning

What is it Janet asked

The old woman moaned and groaned

Are you ill Janet asked

The old woman groaned and moaned

Kinky said Janet come and see if we can help her

Kink murmured to himself and came to her

Whats up missis he asked

Its my poor heart said the old woman with an Irish brogue Im
very queer Its near death I am For the love of Heaven give me a ride
in the beautiful caravan

Where do you want to go Kink growled at her

To Alverminster she said To see my daughter She lives there
Shes been married these five years to a carpenter and shes just had
another baby bless its wee face But me poor hearts that bad I cant
go another step

Kink drew Janet aside Shes an old humbug he said and she smells
of gin Better let her be

Oh Kinky said Janet how can we The poor old thing and her
daughter waiting to see her

Daughter Kink snorted Shes got no daughter Shes trying it on

How horrid you are Janet said I mean to give her a lift anyway

Its against my advice said Kink Anyway promise me you wont give
her any money

Very well said Janet and she invited the old woman to sit on a
chair at the back of the caravan

The saints protect you for your kindness said the old woman getting
to her feet and making her way up the steps with more ease than Janet
had dared to expect The saints protect you allall except that
suspicious ould gossoon wid the whip she added glowering at Kink
who was by no means backward in glowering at her in reply

If you had such a thing as a drop of spirits said the old woman to
Janet who had taken a seat beside her I should be all right The
doctor says that theres nothing like a little stimulant for such
flutterings and spasms as worry me

Im afraid we havent said Janet but I could make you a cup of
tea

Theres a darlin said the old woman Its not so helpful as
spirits but theres comfort in it too

Her sharp little eyes followed Janet as she moved about and brought
together all the tea requisites

Youre a handy young lady she said and may Heaven send you a fine
husband when the time comes Ah its myself as a girl you remind me
of with your quick pretty ways

Where did you live when you were a girl Janet asked

In a little village called Kilbeggy said the old woman My father
was a farmer there until the trouble came upon him But its little
enough happiness we had after that and niver a piece of meat passed
our lips for years Nothing but potatoes and bread And youre eating
meat twice a day Im thinking all of you Ah its a strange world
and a very gay one when youre rich I was rich once me darlin

Were you Janet asked in surprise

Oh yes said the old woman I was rich once Me husband was a
licensed victualler in Harrow and we kept our own wagonette Manys
the time Ive driven it meself into London to a stable in the Edgeware
Road where I left it to do me shopping It was an elegant carriage
and a white horse not so unlike your own only smaller

Janet handed her the tea

Thank you me darlin said the old woman Im feeling better
already Thats a beautiful locket youre wearingit is the very image
of one that belonged to me poor little Clara that died

The old woman began to cry Janet was greatly distressed I cant help
it said the old woman Me poor little Clara I kept it for years and
years and then it was taken from me by my landladys son a
goodfornothing blackguard in lodgings off the Pentonville Road She
sobbed afresh Ive never been happy since she said

Oh Janet exclaimed do take this I dont want it Im sure if it
would make you happy

But its robbing you of it I am said the old woman as her hand
closed on it

Id much rather you had it Janet replied

Heaven bless your kind heart said the old woman

They jogged on and she continued to look around her and to ask
questions She asked all about Janets home and parents

Could you she said at last lend me a shilling my dear Its to
buy the little baby some mittens his poor hands get that cold I dont
want you to give it but couldnt you lend it me only for today Ill
post you a beautiful postal order tonight which my daughters husband
will get for me or a beautiful row of stamps if youll give me the
address of the grand house youll be staying in at Stratford

But Janet was firm she had promised Kink

Not for the poor little mites cold hands said the old woman

It was very hard but Janet had to say no

The old woman said no more for some time Then suddenly Did you ever
see the late King God bless him she asked

Yes said Janet I saw him once It was at the opening of
Parliament

Then you can tell me said the old woman something I want to know
for I was arguing it with my daughters husband the last time I was
here and I want to convince him He saysmy daughters husband that
isthat the King had thick hair on the top of his head God bless him
and I say he hadnt What I say is hed got all the hair he needed So
if you ever saw him you could tell me

Oh no I cant Janet said When I saw him he was in a carriage

What a pity said the old woman But havent you a portrait of him
anywhere

No Im sure we havent said Janet Perhaps we ought to have It
would be more loyal wouldnt it

Never mind said the old woman only it would put my mind at rest
And then suddenly she began to laugh Why she said how silly we
are Of course youve got portraits of himlashins of them darlin

Where Janet exclaimed

In your purse said the old woman On the blessed money On the
shillings and sixpences my dear

Of course said Janet laughing too and she drew out her purse and
looked at the money it contained There was half a sovereign and half a
crown and some smaller coins but none were new ones all were of
Victorias reign

What a pity said the old woman againperhaps one of your brothers
or sisters has some more Not the old blackguard driving of course

Yes said Janet Ill see and descended the steps and soon after
returned with an Edward shilling

The old woman took it and examined head I was right she said God
bless him He was as thin on the top as my own poor father was rest
his soul Well dear and now Ill say goodbye she added soon after
as she rose to her feet and gave the shilling back If youll make
that spalpeen stop Ill get down for me daughters cottage is just
over there across fields Thank you very kindly for the tea and your
sweet company Goodbye good bye she called and the saints protect
you all and she hobbled off through a gate in the hedge

At Alverminster Gregory insisted upon buying some aciddrops and went
to Janet for a penny But when she came to feel for her purse it was
not to be found She hunted everywhere in the caravan but in vain

When did you have it last Kink asked You havent bought anything
today

No said Janet but I had it out when the old Irishwoman was there

I guessed shed get some money out of you said Kink

Oh Kink said Janet she didnt And after I had promised too All
she wanted to see was King Edwards head on a coin

What for Kink asked

To see if he was bald on the top or not said Janet She had had an
argument with her daughters husband about it Which just proves that
you were wrong in thinking she had no daughter

Kink smiled an annoying smile Well he said what then

We found a coin said Janet and found that the King was bald on the
top Thats all

And shortly afterwards she got out Kink asked

Yes soon afterwards

Kink laughed very heartily Well he said I could see she was an
old fraud but I didnt think she would steal anything or I wouldnt
have let her in the caravan at all

Steal Janet cried Why do you think she stole it Its very horrid
and unjust of you

Then where is it Kink asked That stuff about the Kings head was a
trick Its a clear case We must go to the constables house

Oh no said Janet we wont She was a poor old thing and her
heart was bad and she was very unhappy and I dont mind about the
money

Shes an old vagabond said Kink and her hearts as sound as mine
She wants locking up

I wont have it said Janet again If she did steal it it was very
wrong but she has had very bad luck Dont lets think any more about
it but pay for the sweets and get on

Poor Janet no wonder she wanted the matter dropped for there was her
locket to be explained if any of the others noticed it and asked
questions She was very silent for some time and walked alone
thinking hard This was her first experience of theft and it hurt her

The children as it happened never did notice the absence of the
locket but they kept the memory of the old woman very green Nothing
after that could be missed without some reference to her

Wheres the corkscrew Robert would say I suppose Kathleen
Mavourneens got it

Its no use Jack would remark I cant find the salt Erin go
bragh



CHAPTER 19

THE LETTERS TO X

They reached Cirencester at five oclock and at once turned to the
left to the Fairford road intending to camp just outside the town till
Monday and it was here that Gregory had his first rebuff in his
capacity as Requester of Camping Grounds He brought it upon himself by
refusing to let Mary accompany him and indeed refusing advice
altogether

He marched off to the farmhouse which could be seen in the distance
across the meadows full of assurance but misfortunes began at once
No sooner was he well in the first meadow than a flock of geese
suddenly appeared from nowhere and approached him There is something
very horrid about the approach of a flock of geese They are not really
dangerous but they lower their heads and hiss and come on so steadily
and are so impossible to deal with A dog can be hit with a stick but
you cant hit a goose There were no stones to throw and the stupid
angry birds came every moment nearer

Gregory did not wish to go back and did not want to appear frightened
in the eyes of the others who were very likely watching and he
therefore had nothing to do but run as fast as he could for the farther
gate and scramble over it

Here he paused for a moment to be in no way reassured by the sight
much too near the path of a number of bullocks In the ordinary way
Gregory did not mind bullocksdid not in fact think about thembut
just now he was flustered and rather nervous However he walked
steadily forward and got safely past the first Then with his face
kept straight and brave but his eye anxiously peering through the back
of his head to see what the first was doing he approached the second
and got past that all right But the third gave him a wild and as it
seemed furious look and this turned him cold and then he was
perfectly certain that he could feel the others close behind him
breathing hot on his neck and once again he broke into a terrified
run and so gained the next gate over which he may be said to have
fallen rather than climbed

On the other and safe side he paused again and again looked for the
enemy Seeing none he once more started forward

This was the last meadow and the farm was at the end of it and
Gregory was quite close to the farm when suddenly there appeared
right in his path with a challenging tail in air a large doga
collie

Gregory stopped and the collie stopped and the two looked at each
other carefully

Gregory remembered all that he had ever heard about collies being
treacherous and fierce

He advanced a step the collie did not move

He advanced another step and then to his horror the collie began to
advance too lifting his feet high and dangerously

Gregory forced himself to say Good dog but the collie still
advanced

Gregory said Poor fellow then and the collie at once did something
perfectly awful he growled

Gregory had no courage left His tongue and lips refused to obey him
He felt his knees turning to water

How he wished he had let Mary come too Dogs always liked her Why was
it that dogs liked some people and not others he asked himself
Ridiculous No one liked dogs better than he if this ass of a collie
only knew it

Meanwhile the collie still growling drew nearer and Gregory felt
himself pricking all over Where would it bite him first he wondered

But just as he had given up all hope a voice called out sharply
Caesar come here and the collie turned and ran to where a tall
redfaced man was standing

What do you want the man then said to Gregory with equal sharpness
Youre trespassing

Gregory was frankly crying nowwith relief but he pulled himself
together and said he wanted to see the farmer

Im the farmer said the man What is it

Gregory explained what he had come for

No said the farmer not on my land

Gregory said that other farmers had said yes

I dont care said the farmer I say NO

Gregory longed to ask if there was another way back but he had not the
courage and he turned and made again for the gate of the bullock
meadow

The bullocks were still near the path so he climbed softly over the
gate as he feared they might hear him and crept round by the hedge to
the next gate without attracting any notice

Had he only known he might have gone safely by the path for one
bullock was saying to another Theres that little duffer going all
that long way out of his course just for fear of us What do you say to
trotting down to the gate and giving him another scare

No said the other Its not worth while Hes very small too and
these horns you knowthey are a bit startling Besides there are all
those flies by the gate

True said the other but it makes me smile all the same

So Gregory got out safely and performing the same manoeuvre with the
geese he reached the caravan and Janets arms without further
misfortune

The others were of course disappointed at the result of his mission
and walked on another halfmile much farther from Cirencester than
they had wished to be to the next farm

There Mary and Hester made the request which was at once granted and
the farmer and his wife were so much interested that they both walked
down to the Slowcoach and examined it and the farmer advised its being
taken into a yard where there was a great empty barn and backed against
that so that they had the whole of the barn as a kind of anteroom and
a most enchanting smell of hay everywhere

All I ask he said is that you dont burn the place down with your
cooking

The pot was then filled and placed on the fire Kink skinned the
rabbits and Janet and Mary put them in while Jack and Robert and
Horace walked into Cirencester to buy eatables and picture postcards
and send off the telegram

That evening after supper Janet suggested that it might be the best
opportunity they would have to write the letters to X of which they
had often talked so they made themselves comfortable in the caravan
and on the barn floor and each wrote something not after the style of
the Snarkers game at Oxford but quite separately

Janet wrote


Saturday Evening July 8

In a Barn near Cirencester

DEAR X

We thank you very much for the caravan which is much the most
beautiful present that anyone can ever have had We have now been in it
nearly ten days and we like it more every day We have called it the
Slowcoach The party is seven and Kink who drives We have with us
Mary and Jack Rotheram and Horace Campbell but whether you know who
they are or not of course I dont know I hope some day you will tell
us who you are

I am
 Yours sincerely
 JANET AVORY


Mary Rotheram wrote

DEAR MR X


Then she crossed out the Mr because as she said it might be a
lady and began again

DEAR X

I am not one of the Avories and the caravan was therefore not given
to me but my brother and I have been so happy in it that I want to say
thank you for it quite as if I were an Avory all the time We live near
them at Chiswick you know It has been a supreme holiday with hardly
any rain and no real troubles although even the strongest people must
sometimes get a little tired of walking on dusty roads and having to
wait for meals We each have a special duty and I am the head cook
but Janet is really better at it than I am Our only real
disappointment is that caravaning makes you so tired that there is no
chance of cricket for we brought cricket things with us but have
never been able to use them We might have done so at Salford perhaps
but the river was so very tempting that we rowed about instead

Yours sincerely and gratefully

MARY ROTHERAM


Jack Rotheram wrote

DEAR X

My sister Mary has said who I am but she has not explained how it is
I am here It is because my brother William and I tossed up for it He
called Heads and it was tails so I won at once And then he said
Threes which means the best out of three and this time he called
Tails and it was heads so that settled the thing absolutely He was
of course most frightfully sick about it but the next time the
Avories go out in the caravan they are going to ask him and not me
which will put the thing right It is a ripping caravan and I am sure
I thank you very much although its not mine

Yours truly

JOHN ILFORD ROTHERAM


Robert who was not a sprightly writer merely described the course
they had followed which we all know The only news he had to give was
at the end So far up to the time of writing my pedometer registers
fiftysix miles which is of course only what I have walked and not
what we have done for we all take turns to ride for fear of getting
too tired and being seedy The caravan has done altogether one hundred
and forty miles and since we were in it ninety miles exactly


Horace after great difficulty wrote

DEAR X

I am having a tophole holiday in the caravan you gave the Avories I
am the Keeper of the Tinopener

Yours truly

HORACE CAMPBELL


Hester wrote

DEAR X

I have long wanted to write to you and tell you that we adore the
Slowcoach which is the name we have given your caravan and think you
were awfully clever to think of it and to make it so complete

We have not had to buy anything and the only thing you forgot was the
license but Uncle Christopher remembered I love walking behind the
Slowcoach and seeing the world pass by But the evenings are the most
alluring and I like to wake up at night and hear the birds and animals
just outside the window although on the first night I was frightened
We had one evening with real gipsies but Janet would not allow me to
go inside their caravan because of fleas and things But I could see
through the door that it was not so attractive as the Slowcoach I wish
this journey would never end but I fear it has to do so on Tuesday
which draws nearer every moment

I am

Your grateful and admiring friend

HESTER MARGARET AVORY

PSI hope we shall never know who you are because anonymous things
are so much more exciting

PS 2We have met many motors and they are always coming up behind
us and making us jump and blinding us with dust but we have never
envied them


Gregory wrote painfully

DEAR X

Thank you most awfully for the Slowcoach It is very good and
suitable I am the Keeper of the Corkscrew and also the Requester of
CampingGrounds

Your affectionate

GREGORY BRUCE AVORY



CHAPTER 20

THE ADVENTURE OF THE LINE OF POETRY

ON the next morning which was Sunday Jack hurried through his
dressing and washing at a great pace and instantly disappeared The
others were just beginning breakfast when he came rushing up in a state
of wild excitement calling Kink Kink

What is it said that leisurely man

Its a rabbit cried Jack Ive caught it and I dont know how to
kill it

Oh Jack said Mary running up dont kill it Why should it be
killed

For supper of course said Jack Come on Kink Quick or it will
get away

They all left their breakfast and followed Jack and when they came up
to him he was kneeling over a kicking object

Oh Kink he said do hold it and kill it How do you do it The
gipsy boy didnt show me properly

The gipsy boy said Mary

Yes he gave me a wire See its round its neck Thats how I caught
him Do kill him Kink

Please dont do anything of the kind said Janet We dont want to
eat rabbits we catch like that

No said Hester please dont kill it Please let it go

What mollycoddles you are said Jack How do you suppose rabbits are
killed anyway You eat them all right when theyre cooked

I couldnt eat a rabbit that I had seen struggling alive said Janet

No said Mary Oh Jack please let him go Youve caught him and
thats the great thing and now be merciful

Kink still held the struggling creature

I vote hes let loose again said Robert I dont want any of him

No and Im sure I dont said Gregory but wouldnt it be fun to
keep him in a hutch

Wild rabbits are no good in hutches said Kink

Jack was very sullen Its awful rot he said You all ought to be
vegetarians if you talk like that But well let him go and he
loosened the wire and the rabbit dashed away

A nice return to the gipsy for his kindness Jack muttered

Kink watched the rabbit till it was out of sight Whose rabbit do you
suppose that was he asked

Mine said Jack

What about the farmer said Kink

A nice return for a nights lodgingpoaching his rabbits

Poaching cried Horace Is that poaching Is Jack a poacher Oh how
splendid Jacks a poacher Jacks a poacher I wish I was

Id never thought of it as poaching said Jack who was not a little
proud of his new character

When did you set the wire Horace asked him

Late last night said Jack After you had turned in

Wasnt it pitch dark Horace asked

There was a moon said Jack feeling twice his ordinary size

But what did you do Horace asked

Well said Jack I had noticed some rabbits in that field on our way
back from Cirencester so I just crept off in the dark and found a
hole and took a strong stick and drove that into the ground and then
fixed the wire to it with the noose open like this so that the rabbit
would run right into it when it came out And it did Poachings
frightfully simple

Yes said Horace but it wants courage

Oh yes said Jack lightly Of course one mustnt be a fool or a
coward

It was arranged that Janet and Jack and Robert and Hester should go to
church and Mary and the others stay behind to cook The boys walked
but Janet and Hester were driven in by the farmer in his chaise Janet
had a rather uncomfortable moment at the beginning of the sermon for
the text was taken from Matthew xxii where the piece of money is
produced and the question asked Whose is this image and
superscription Of course they all thought simultaneously of the old
Irishwoman and gave Janet a quick glance She was very glad that Kink
who was a Dissenter was not with them to fix his old laughing eye
upon her

Mary had worked very hard over the Sunday dinner and a great surprise
was waiting for the four churchgoersnothing less than a beefsteak
pudding with the most perfect soft crust and heaps of juice and
afterwards pancakes The farmers wife sent down some strawberries and
cream so that it was a real feast The only one of them that was not
hungry was Mary who was too hot and tired of cooking to be able to eat
much

In spite of this huge and momentous dinner all the children went out
on Sunday afternoon to explore the neighbourhood except Hester who
said she had something very important to do and begged to be allowed to
remain alone in the Slowcoach Kink said that he would stay there too

On the other side of Cirencester is a very beautiful park with a broad
avenue through it from the gates right in the town itself The farmers
wife had told them of its attractions and also of a ruined house known
as Alfreds Hall and a point called the Seven Ways where seven green
avenues met and a canal that ran through a tunnel and all within the
possibilities of good walkers the source of the Thames itself And
said she after you have seen thatthe tiny spring which makes that
wonderful river that runs right through Londonoh Ive been to London
in my timeyou can come back to Cirencester by the Fosse Waythe
Roman road to Bath They could not of course see all these things
but they went to the ruined house which was very romantic and exactly
the place for Hester had she only been with them and they roamed about
the park which was very vast and wonderful

They had a little adventure too for as they were walking along on
the way backcoming back of course by a different way for Robert
could not bear the thought of not doing soMary chanced to say with
reference to the plans for the future which Robert was describing

 Tomorrow to fresh fields and pastures new

that being her idea of the last line of Miltons Lycidas which they
had all learned quite recently

Not fresh fields Janet corrected fresh woods

Fields said Mary

Woods said Janet

Im sure its fields said Mary

But its silly said Janet to say fresh fields and pastures new
because they mean the same thing Fresh woods would mean something
different

I cant help it said Mary thats Miltons affair Fresh fields

Janet called to Robert Is it fresh fields and pastures new or
fresh woods and pastures new she asked him

Fresh fields he said

Janet asked Jack I dont know he said but fresh woods sounds
more sensible

Oh dear said Janet I wish we had a Milton

Well we havent said Robert and youre not likely to find one at
Cirencester today unless of course the vicar has one

Oh yes said Janet of coursethe vicar Hes certain to have one

But wholl ask him said Horace

Janet will said Mary

Oh no said Janet

Well its your affair said Robert

Not more than Marys said Janet Mary will you ask him

No said Mary I dont think I could Not the vicar I might be
willing to ask the curate

What a ripping idea said Jack Of course the curate would be much
easier Well ask where he lives

They did so at a small tobacconists that was open and found that the
curate had rooms at Myrtle Villa quite close by

They therefore marched towards Myrtle Villa but first arranged to draw
lots to see who should ring the bell and make the inquiry They tore up
paper of different sizes and it was agreed that the holders of the
longest and the shortest pieces should gothe longest to put the
question the shortest to ring and lend support The result was that
Mary drew the longest and Gregory the smallest

Gregory was furious I dont even know what its all about he
complained

They told him

How rotten he said Whats it matter

Mary however led him off to the house and he rang the bell with
vigour

A smiling girl opened the door and asked what they wanted

Is the curate at home Mary asked

The girl said that he was

Will you ask him if he will speak to us for a moment said Mary

What about asked the girl He has a friend with him

I dont think youd understand if we told you said Mary

I must know what its about said the girl He doesnt like to be
disturbed on Sunday afternoons

Has he got a lot of bookspoetry books Gregory asked

Yes said the girl heaps

Then its about Milton said Mary

Milton the baker exclaimed the girl Hes not dead is he

Milton the poet said Mary

Im all in a maze said the girl I dont know what youre talking
about But I suppose Id better tell him

The girl left them on the mat and knocked at a door just inside

Come in said a mans voice

Please sir said the girl there are two children asking about
someone named Milton

The owner of the voice laughed Are they he said Well theyve
come to the right shop And then the door opened wider and a tall and
handsome young man came out dressed in a cricket blazer over a
clergymans waistcoat and collar and smoking a large pipe

Whats all this about Milton he said cheerily What Milton Not the
poet

Yes said Mary

Oh I say this is too good said the young clergyman Vernon he
called out come here and see a deputation from Milton

Another young man joined him equally pleasant looking and they all
shook hands

Come inside said the young clergyman

There are four others waiting in the road said Gregory Then fetch
them in too said the young clergyman And Janet and Robert and Jack
and Horace were brought in

Now said the young clergyman have some tea And he rang the bell
and ordered enough tea for eight

When the girl had gone he asked for full particulars and then gave
his verdict

Fresh woods and pastures new

Oh rubbish said Vernon Ive always learned fresh fields and
pastures new

Thats what I say said Mary

And so do I said Robert and Horace

I think YOURE right said Janet to the young clergyman

Well he said Ill look it up And he began to hunt for Milton on
his shelves

Oh not yet said Vernon Lets have some fun first Lets see who
are the fielders and who are the wooders All fielders this way

Mary Robert and Horace ranged themselves beside him leaving Janet
and Jack with the young clergyman whom Vernon called Rod

Gregory looked at both sides and did not move

Havent you any views about it asked Vernon

No said Gregory I never heard the thing before What does it
matter

Very well then said Rod heres the tea You pour it out for us I
like three lumps of sugar in mine Now he continued the rout of the
fielders is about to begin Of course its woods Why I can see
the word now in Miltons own handwriting as I used to see it in the
Library at Trinity

Im so sure its fields said Vernon that I declare myself
willing to go without cake for tea if it isnt

Will you put half a crown in the plate next Sunday if its woods
said Rod

Oh I say thats a bit stiff said Vernon Half a crown

Very well then said Rod two bob Will you put two bob in the
plate next Sunday if its woods

Yes I will said Vernon But if its fields what will you do
You maynt take a shilling out

No said Rod if its fields Ill eat my best hat

I hope its fields said Gregory

Horrid little boy said Rod But now well see

He opened Milton slowly and turned over the pages of Lycidas Ha
ha he said no cake for Charles Vernon Esquire and two bob for
Mother Church And my best hat saved Listen

 At last he rose and twitchd his mantle blue
 Tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new


No cake groaned Vernon Repulsive children he continued
tragically Why did you knock at this unhappy door and ask your
foolish question here Are there no other houses in Cirencester No
cake No cake

They screamed with laughter

I like them said Rod Theyre nice children I hope theyll come
again And now for a large tea with plenty of cake for all but one of
us

They would have liked to stay a long time for Rod and Vernon were very
kind and amusing but Janet had Hester on her mind left alone in the
Slowcoach and so directly tea was finished they said goodbye

When Hester was told about their adventure she said How silly you
all are

Why they asked indignantly

For two reasons said Hester One is that it is of course fresh
woods Anyone ought to know that And the other is that weve got the
Blue Poetry Book with it in here in the caravan

That doesnt matter said Gregory We met a jolly decent clergyman

What Hesters great business had been Janet soon learned for as soon
as they were alone Hester slipped some sheets of paper into Janets
hand and asked her to read them very privately Janet retired to the
boudoir end of the caravan and read It was a poem entitled

 ODE TO THE REV FRANCIS GASTREEE

 Dedicated to Mr Nicholas Imber

 O thou most base
 Who hadst possession of the dwellingplace
 Of William Shakespeare Stratfords loveliest son
 What is it thou hast done
 Thou shouldst have treasurd it as in a case
 We keep a diamond or other jewel
 Instead of which thou didst it quite erase
 O wicked man O fool
 What should be done to thee
 Hanged upon a tree
 Or in the pillory
 Placed for all to pelt with eggs and bitter zest
 Aye that were best
 Would that thou wert i th pillory this moment
 And Stratford all in foment
 Thou knave thou cad
 Thou everything thats bad

 HESTER MARGARET AVORY


Janet said it was splendid after you had got hold of the difficult
rhyming idea

Thats because its an ode said Hester Odes go like that All
jumpy And you mustnt say you in an ode You must say thou

But what shall you do with it Janet asked

I want to send it to Mr Imber said Hester He said something ought
to be done He gave me his address do you think we could post it this
evening

Janet said they could and they walked to the postoffice and sent it
off together with a letter to Mrs Avory and picture postcards for
Runcie and Collins The budget for X they kept as they had not
brought his address with them



CHAPTER 21

COLLINSS PEOPLE

They resumed their journey the next morning a little depressed in
spirits for the end was so near It was now Monday and they had to be
home againthat is to say in their home without wheelstomorrow
night and the thought was not exhilarating Moreover as Roberts
compass only too plainly showed they were now for the first time since
they started moving due east or towards Chiswick instead of away from
it as theretofore

Holidays of a fortnight always go faster in the second week than the
first but the last two days absolutely fly

They were now bound for Faringdon through Fairford and the nightthe
last nightwas to be spent if possible on the farm of Collinss
brother near Lechlade

At Fairford they had their lunch and explored the church which is one
of the most remarkable in England It was built they learned from
Roberts Road Book by a rich merchant in the reign of Henry VII
named John Tame Being something of a privateer too he had the good
fortune to capture a vessel on its way from Belgium to Italy laden with
stained glass and having secured this booty he erected the church in
order to make use of it

Horace admired this story immensely and set John Tame with his other
heroesRaffles and Robin Hoodforthwith

Then came the hunt for Lycetts Farm where Collinss people now lived
of which they knew no more than that Lechlade was the postal address
It might be this side of Lechlade and it might be far on the other
Collins had had the map placed before her but could make nothing of
it Cooks never can read maps

After about two miles out of Fairford Robert began to ask There were
no people on the roadindeed one of the things that they had noticed
throughout their travels was how few persons were to be met and they
had therefore to knock at a door here and there or approach labourers
in the fields Their ignorance of the name either of Lycetts or of
Collins was amazing

Never heard tell of such a place said one

Not hereabouts said another

Collins said a third Theres a stonemason of that name over at
Highworth but I dont know of no farmer

Maybe youre thinking of Sadlers another suggested

Robert who was getting testy asked why Sadlers doesnt sound a bit
either like Collins or Lycetts he said

No the man agreed it doesnt

But at last a butchers boy on a bicycle came along and Janet stopped
him

Lycetts he said Then he brightened Lickets perhaps you mean
Thats up the next turning to the left I dont know whos got it
because Im a stranger here but Ive heard that Lickets lies that way

So Robert was recalled from a distant meadow where he had seen a man
working and they hurried on

The turning was not a main road but a long lane which was so narrow
that nothing else could possibly have passed by had they met anything
and for a while nothing did come And then suddenly at a bend there was
a fat farmer driving a dogcart straight at them

He pulled up at once and roared out Where be you coming to then We
dont want no gipsies here

Kink stopped too and the farmer and he glared at each other

You must back down to the next gate said the farmer

Back yourself said Kink Your loads lighter than mine

But its my land youre on said the farmer

Its a public road said Kink

It looked as though they might stay there for ever but suddenly the
farmer began to laugh Why youre not gipsies he said I believe
youre Avories

Thats so said Kink

Well Im blessed the farmer cried And to think we should be
falling out when Ive been waiting to see you these many days My
names Pescod My halfsisters your cook

Mr Pescod climbed out of his cart and shook hands with all the
children Now Ill turn he said with a smile to Kink and he led
his horse up the lane talking all the while while the Slowcoach
followed They told him about their difficulty in finding any trace of
him and he called Collins a donkey for not directing them better and
forgetting to say that her name and his were different

Never mind he said here you are at last Weve been looking out
for you for a long time My missis never hears wheels nowadays but what
she runs to the door to see if its you

Lycetts farm was a long low white house with a yew hedge leading
from the garden gate to the front door This hedge of which Collins
had told them was famous in the neighbourhood for it was enormously
old and as thick almost as masonry and it was kept so carefully
clipped that it was as smooth also as a wall At the gate itself the
yews were cut into tall pillars with a pheasant at the top of each and
then there were smaller pillars at intervals all the way up the path
about twenty yards with a thick joining band of yew between them They
were so massive that very little light could get into the front windows
or the doorway but as Mr Pescod said anyone can have light few
yew hedges like that in the world

Mrs Pescod was a comfortable smiling woman whose one idea was that
everyone must either be hungry or in need of feeding up All of the
children in turn she looked at anxiously saying that she was sure that
they had not had enough to eat As a matter of fact they had not
perhaps eaten as much as they would have done at Chiswick and they
had of course worked harder but they were all very well and said
so But it made no difference to Mrs Pescod

Ah my dear she said to Janet youre pale I shouldnt like you to
go back to your ma looking like that No while youre here you must
have three good meals A good tea and a good supper and a good
breakfast I wish youd stay longer and let me have a real go at you
but if you cant you cant and theres an end of it

Mrs Pescods notion of a good tea was terrific Eggs for everyone to
begin with to Gregorys great pleasure for an egg with his tea was
almost his favourite treat Freshly baked hot cakes soaking in butter
Hot toast Three kinds of jam Bread and butter Watercress Mustard
and cress This was at five oclock and as supper was at halfpast
eight Janet urged the others to explore as much as possible or they
would have no appetite and then Mrs Pescod would be miserable

It was a delightful farm There was everything that one wants in a
farma pond with ducks a haystack half cut so that one might jump
about on it straw ricks on stone posts cowsheds smelling so warm and
friendly with swallows darting in and out of the doorway to their
nests in the roof stables with gentle horses who ate the green stuff
you gave them without biting you guineapigs the property of Master
Walter Pescod who was a weekly boarder at Cirencester fantail
pigeons bantams ferrets very frightening to everyone but Kink who
knew just how to hold them and a turnipslicer which Gregory turned
for some time munching turnip all the while

Mrs Pescod led the girls round with her on an egghunt which is
always one of the most interesting expeditions in life and Mr Pescod
as the evening drew on allowed the boys to accompany him with his gun
to get a rabbit or two under the hedge and he permitted Jack to fire
it off Nothing happened except that Jack was nearly knocked backwards
by the kick but he was very proud of the bruise and when he
returned to Chiswick showed it to his father and to William in triumph

It was getting purple then with green edges and Dr Rotheram
pronounced it one of the best bruises he had ever seen Good enough
he said to have killed a lion with

Yes said William instead of missing a rabbit

Mrs Pescod of course wanted the children to sleep indoors but they
would not It is our very last night in the caravan said Janet and
we couldnt give it up So Mrs Pescod instead made them promise to
come to breakfast and gave them each a large cake of her own making in
case they felt hungry in the night



CHAPTER 22

THE ADVENTURE OF THE GIANT

After receiving a thousand messages for Collins both affectionate and
jocularone from Mr Pescod being on no account to forget to tell her
to try antifatthey said goodbye to these kind folk and marched into
Faringdon the next morning very sorry it was the last but determined
to make a brave show Through watery Lechdale they went over the Isis
as the Thames is called here and past Buscot

It was just after leaving Buscot that Gregory who had been ahead
alone suddenly rushed back in a wild state of excitement

What do you think Ive seen he panted A giant A real live giant

Dont be an ass said Jack

But I have he protestedI have Hes there in that wood kneeling
by the stream washing his face I watched him walk to it Hes
enormous Hes as tall as this caravan nearly Do come and peep at him

They all very readily accompanied Gregory into the wood and there
sure enough was a giant combing his hair

He heard them coming and looked round They stopped openeyed and
openmouthed

Here I say the giant said at last this wont do You mustnt look
at me like thatfree Its a penny each you know

He had a broad Yorkshire accent and a kind face

Where do you come from he asked

We come from London said Janet We are on a caravan journey

A caravan journey said the giant So am I I always am in fact

Are you said Gregory How splendid

Splendid said the giant Do you think so Id give a good deal to
sleep in a bed in a house Excuse me if I sit down he added My legs
arent very strong

He sat down but even then he was taller than any of the children

Where is your caravan Janet asked

Just over there the giant said Theyre waiting for me I came here
to make my toilet Where are you going

Were going to Faringdon said Robert

Thats where weve come from said the giant Theres been a fair
there Were going to Cirencester

What a shame said Horace That means weve missed you

But youre seeing me now said the giant adding again with his
Yorkshire laugh free

I know said Jack but thats not the same as at a fair The naphtha
lamps you know

The giant shuddered I like to be away from them he said

Who else is there with you asked Gregory

The King said the giant

The King they all exclaimed

Yes King Pip Hes a dwarf We travel together but we show
separately A penny each

Might we see him if we paid a penny Janet asked

I shouldnt if I were you said the giant

Why not said Gregory Isnt he nice

No said the giant very firmly Hes not hes nasty

Im so sorry said Janet

So am I said the giant

Ive always liked giants best said Mary

But why dont you leave him said Jack

I cant said the giant We dont belong to ourselves We belong to
Mr Kite Mr Kite is the showman

And did you sell yourself to him like a slave Hester asked

The giant laughed Very much like a slave he said You see theres
nothing else to do when youre big like me and have no money Im too
weak to work and its ridiculous too No one ought to be so big So I
must do what I can

Whats the matter with King Pip Robert asked

Hes selfish and badtempered said the giant He thinks its a fine
thing to be so small

And you think it a fine thing to be so big dont you said Robert

The giant opened his blue eyes I Not me Id give everything I ever
possessed to be five feet seven instead of seven feet five Its never
done me any good

But its rather grand to be as big as that Robert suggested

Grand You may have the grandeur Its worse than being a criminal I
cant walk out unless its pitch dark or very early morning because if
I did the people would see me freeas you are doingI have to live in
a narrow stuffy carriage Im ill too Giants are always ill

Janet was full of sympathy Were so sorry she said And heres our
moneyit isnt fair to be seeing you free And she held out sixpence

Oh no said the giant I didnt mean that I like to see you and
talk Theres too few people to talk to naturally Most of them ask
silly questions all the time especially the doctors If you want to
pay to see me you must come to the fair I shall be on view tonight

But were going the other way said Robert

Im very sorry said the giant I should have looked forward to
seeing you

Whats your name Gregory asked

My real name is William Steward said the giant but they call me
the Human Colossus

Is there anything we could do for you

Janet asked We have some papers would you like them

No said the giant I dont read much There is one thing Id like
but I dont suppose you have it A little tobacco Im clean out of it
and Id like a smoke

Weve got tobacco all right said Robert You know he added to
Janet in that tin labelled For

But Janet stopped him in time and drew him aside Run and get it
she said but be sure to scrape the label off He wouldnt like to see
For Tramps and Gipsies on it

Robert was quickly back and handed the tin to the giant who was
delighted

He was just beginning his thanks when a shrill whistle sounded and he
said goodbye instead

Thats His Majesty he explained He thinks Ive been long enough
And I am long enough he added making his only joketoo long Well
goodbye Im glad to have met you Dont forget to look for the Human
Colossus whenever you come to a fair Its easy to remember the Human
Colossus Goodbye

And he shambled off through the trees to the road

They had their last lunch with Kink just outside Faringdons red town
and then sped him on his solitary way home promising however to come
and meet him somewhere outside London in three or four days time and
so they stood in a group in the middle of the road until the Slowcoach
and its driver and its black guardian were out of sight And if some of
their eyes were not quite dry I am sure you dont blame them

Now said Robert as he made a note of what his pedometer
saidsixtyseven miles and a quarter for he considered this the end
of the real walknow for the station

First however a telegram had to go and Hester insisted on sending
it as she had an idea and this is what she sent

Avory The Gables Chiswick Alas alack were coming back

They caught a train on the funny little branchline which turned them
out at Uffington and armed with Mr Scotts present The Scouring of
the White Horse which Mary carried and occasionally read scraps from
as they walked along they made for the green hills and the famous
animal cut on their side To reach it was impossible for the London
train left at 624 and it was now nearly three and there was tea to
be eaten but they came near enough to see it distinctly and to marvel
that the name of horse should ever have been given to it As Gregory
said Its no more like a horse than Shakespeare is like a swan

And then they had tea at a nice inn at Uffington in a parlour full of
photograph frames and returned to the station

As the train left they leaned back in their seats a great deal more
tired than they had ever been in the Slowcoach

What a hateful rate this train goes at said Robert I prefer two
miles an hour

Oh yes they said

At Paddington they found Collins and Eliza Pollard with a station
omnibus and they rattled down to Chiswick pouring out the news
especially that from Lycetts farm

And so after dropping Mary and Jack and Horace at their homes they
came once again to The Gables A cold supper was waiting for
themone of those nice late meals after a journeyand Mrs Avory and
Runcie sat with them while they ate it

You must be glad to be back Runcie said and to sleep in nice beds
once more

Oh Runcie said Hester you dont really understand anything

I understand what King Edwards head is like on a shilling said
Runcie with a little twinkle at Janet

Janet blushed

What a shame she said to tell that story Hester I suppose that
was you in one of your letters

Yes said Hester but Janet darling you told me always to tell all
the news



CHAPTER 23

THE MOST SURPRISING ADVENTURE OF ALL

The children had been back two or three days and Kink was still on the
road when one morning a telegram came from him saying that he had
reached Hounslow and Robert asked if they might all walk out to meet
him and so return home triumphantly in a body Mrs Avory agreed and
they trooped off after the briefest lunch taking Horace Campbell and
the Rotherams with them

They had been gone two or three hours and Mrs Avory was sitting
talking with Runcie when Eliza Pollard brought a card on the brass
tray that Janet had repoussed for her mothers last Christmas present
It ran

 MR HENRY AMORY
 The Red House
 Chiswick W


I dont know him said Mrs Avory What is he like

Well mum said Eliza Pollard hes a short gentleman with a red
face and two boys and he seems very angry

Ask him what he wants to see me about said Mrs Avory

I did said Eliza Pollard and he said he could not tell me but the
matter was of the highest importance

Mrs Avory took the card and descended to the drawingroom where the
visitors were waiting for her

Mr Amory bowed Pardon me madam he said but I have come to know
what you have done with my caravan

Your caravan

Yes madam my caravan A caravan was sent as a present to my sons
some three weeks or a month ago and your family I am creditably
informed seized and detained it

Excuse me said Mrs Avory but we did nothing of the sort A
caravan was sent here for my children as a present and we have simply
made use of it They have been away in it for a fortnight It returns
today

Ha said Mr Amory Perhaps you will have the goodness to inform me
who gave it to you

That said Mrs Avory I cant do

Ha said Mr Amory

because Mrs Avory continued I dont know We have never
discovered The giver wished to be anonymous

Mr Amory looked surprised and became a shade less fierce

You took no steps to find out he asked

How could I There was no clue to go upon

I see I see said Mr Amory There has been a huge mistake Perhaps
you will allow me to read you a letter which we received a day or so
ago

DEAR CHILDREN

I have just come back much sooner than I expected but finding no
letter from you I have made some inquiries as to what you have done
with the caravan and to my amazement cannot discover that it has
ever reached you at all and since if it has not this letter must be
all Greek to you I may now say that on the 23rd of June a caravan
fully furnished for a journey should have arrived at your house with a
letter saying it was from your friend X as it amused me to call
myself I have been to the man whom I employed to take it to you but
he is in hospital His wife however is convinced that he did take it
to Chiswick all right Please ask your father to try to discover to
what house it was sent Tomorrow evening I shall come to see you all

Your affectionate
 UNCLE EUSTACE


There said Mr Amory you see Not however that I should have let
my sons go away in itat any rate without methe two little boys
wincedbut different people have different ideas Well he
continued I have been investigating and of course I soon discovered
that the caravan had come here and that your children had gone off in
it I will admit that we have only just come to Chiswick and that you
were better known here but the fact remains that the letter was
addressed not to the name of Avory but Amory

Mrs Avory was bewildered It is all very unexpected she said I
really cannot remember reading the address on the envelope at all It
was handed to me as mine and I opened it It may have been Amory If
you care to see the letter I have it

Please said Mr Amory and Mrs Avory went to her desk

Now boys listen to me said Mr Amory to his two sons Let this be
a lesson to you Never give anonymous presents It is foolish and it
leads to trouble and very likely the wrong person will be thanked

Mrs Avory handed him the letter and he read it

Quite clear he said but not what I call a sensible way of doing
things Your explanation satisfies me

Mrs Avory expressed her regret that the mistake had occurred But
she added you must allow that we had no other course than to accept
the present as though it really belonged to us We have for so many
years been the only Avories here

But have you so many friends Mr Amory inquired who would be
likely to give you anonymously so handsome a gift It did not strike
you as strange

Certainly not said Mrs Avory

Mr Amory again said Ha

The caravan Mrs Avory resumed rising to her feet shall be put in
order directly it returns and sent to your address Anything that has
been taken from it or broken shall be replaced I can say no more than
that Good afternoon

It was not however the end of the visit for at that instant the
sound of heavy wheels was heard and cheers in the street and looking
out of the window Mrs Avory saw that the Slowcoach had already
arrived escorted as it had left by all the children of Chiswick and
a moment later Janet burst into the room crying Mother do come and
see

She pulled up stiff on observing the strangers

Janet dear said Mrs Avory there has been a serious mistake The
Slowcoach is not ours at all It belongs to this gentlemans children

Janet gasped But it was sent to us she said at last

No said Mr Amory I beg your pardon young lady but it was sent
to us It came to you in error

Janet looked questioningly at her mother and Mrs Avory nodded yes
Hester and Gregory now entered the room to insist on their mother
either coming out or giving leave for some of the street children to be
allowed to go inside the caravan But Mr Amory interposed No he
said I prefer not They are rarely clean

Gregory looked at him in dismay

Mother he exclaimed

Janet whispered Mrs Avory who knew her youngest son take Gregory
away and keep him out of sight till they go

But we Mr Amory resumed will examine the caravan I suppose there
was no inventory

No said Mrs Avory

Very unfortunate he muttered and very unsystematic However we
must hope for the best and so saying he led the way toward the yard
with his meek little sons who had said not a word but appeared to
wish themselves well out of the affair behind him

Kink had already unharnessed Moses and the Slowcoach stood at rest
Mr Amory first went to examine a place on the wheel where a gatepost
had removed some of the paint and he then put a foot on the step but
Diogenes sprang up and growled so seriously that he withdrew

Please remove the dog he said

While this was being done and the father and his two sons were inside
Janet explained the situation to the others They refused at first to
believe it

Do you mean to say Robert exclaimed that the Slowcoach isnt ours
at all

Yes said Janet

It belongs to those measly pipsqueaks said Robert

Yes said Janet

Robert held his head in a kind of stupor



CHAPTER 24

THE END

They had a very solemn tea Everyone was depressed and mortified

We couldnt help it could we mother Janet said several times

Of course not said Mrs Avory Its no ones fault except the
foolish man who brought the caravan here What has Kink said about it
But as no one had asked him he was called to the cedartree beneath
which tea was laid on fine days

Heres a go mum he said

What did the man say who brought the caravan Mrs Avory said

As near as I can remember he showed me the letter and said Is that
all right I looked at it and read To be given to Mrs Avory on
it so I said Yes Then he said Ive got a caravan for your lot
cockie and backed it into the yard

How splendid said Robert Then it was you who did it Kinky

Did what Master Robert

Got us the Slowcoach because the address wasnt Mrs Avory at all it
was Mrs Amory

Oh I dont take much count about ms or vs said Kink It began
with a big A and it ended in ory and that was good enough for me

Kink said Janet youre a dear Youve given us the most beautiful
holiday

Hester suddenly turned pale Mother she exclaimed what about the
twentyfive sovereigns

Yes said Robert thats awful

It is rather bad said Mrs Avory because of course it will have
to be given back and at once too and Im not at all rich just now
Im not even sure that we have any right to go to Sea View and the
twentyfive pounds will just spoil everything

Why should we give it back said Gregory

Because its not ours said Mrs Avory Theres no question at all

I think Kinky ought to pay it said Gregory Hes got heaps of money
in the PostOffice and its his fault too

The best thing to do said Mrs Avory is to telephone to Uncle
Christopher and tell him all about it and ask him to come over
tonight and give us his advice He always knows best

And Mr Scott and Mr Lenox too said Robert

Very well said Mrs Avory They were all here at the beginning and
they had better be here at the end

Mr Lenox who came first was immensely tickled Who stole the
caravan he asked at intervals through the evening

Mr Scott took it more practically We must have another he said
and have it built to our own design Let the Slowcoach provide the
groundplan so to speak and then improve on it by the light of your
experience You must by this time each know of certain little defects
in the Slowcoach that could easily be done away with

Of course said Robert Blisters

Dont rot said Gregory I know of something Mr Scott The roof
It ought to have a felt covering so as to soften the rain

Exactly said Mr Scott And you Janet

I used to wonder said Janet if there could not be some poles such
as those that you raise carriagewheels with when you wash them to
lift the caravan above its springs at night As it is every movement
makes it shake or rock They could be carried underneath quite easily

Very good said Mr Scott And you

I heard about a caravan yesterday said Mary that had two little
swings at the back for small children when they were tired

Thats a good idea said Mr Lenox For Gregory for instance

Im not a small child said Gregory and I dont get tired

Oh said Janet what about those times when you said you couldnt
walk at all

Shut up said Gregory

Very well then said Mr Scott if you really are still keen on
caravaning Ill give you a new one with proper titledeeds in case
any new Mr Amory turns up and we will all superintend its building

Hurrah cried the children

And well call it Slowcoach the Second It was at this point that
Uncle Christopher came in

This is very sad he said To think of my nephews and nieces running
off with another persons caravan

But what shall we do Mrs Avory asked

Theres nothing to do said Uncle Christopher but to have it
cleaned up and put in order as soon as possible and sent round to its
real owner

The dreadful thing said Janet is the twentyfive pounds

Yes I know said Uncle Christopher but I believe theres a way out
of even that difficulty I told your aunt all about it when I got back
from the office and she wished me to tell you that she would like to
refund the twentyfive pounds herself

There was a long pause

O dear said Janet at last as she hid her face in her mothers arms
everybody is much too kind
