The story of Catherine which appeared in Frasers Magazine in
183940 was written by Mr Thackeray under the name of Ikey Solomons
Jun to counteract the injurious influence of some popular fictions of
that day which made heroes of highwaymen and burglars and created a
false sympathy for the vicious and criminal

With this purpose the author chose for the subject of his story a
woman named Catherine Hayes who was burned at Tyburn in 1726 for the
deliberate murder of her husband under very revolting circumstances
Mr Thackerays aim obviously was to describe the career of this
wretched woman and her associates with such fidelity to truth as to
exhibit the danger and folly of investing such persons with heroic and
romantic qualities




CHAPTER I Introducing to the reader the chief personages of this
narrative


At that famous period of history when the seventeenth century after
a deal of quarrelling kingkilling reforming republicanising
restoring rerestoring playwriting sermonwriting
OliverCromwellising Stuartising and Orangising to be sure had sunk
into its grave giving place to the lusty eighteenth when Mr Isaac
Newton was a tutor of Trinity and Mr Joseph Addison Commissioner of
Appeals when the presiding genius that watched over the destinies of
the French nation had played out all the best cards in his hand and his
adversaries began to pour in their trumps when there were two kings in
Spain employed perpetually in running away from one another when there
was a queen in England with such rogues for Ministers as have never
been seen no not in our own day and a General of whom it may be
severely argued whether he was the meanest miser or the greatest hero
in the world when Mrs Masham had not yet put Madam Marlboroughs nose
out of joint when people had their ears cut off for writing very
meek political pamphlets and very large fullbottomed wigs were just
beginning to be worn with powder and the face of Louis the Great as
his was handed in to him behind the bedcurtains was when issuing
thence observed to look longer older and more dismal daily

About the year One thousand seven hundred and five that is in the
glorious reign of Queen Anne there existed certain characters and
befell a series of adventures which since they are strictly in
accordance with the present fashionable style and taste since they have
been already partly described in the Newgate Calendar since they are
as shall be seen anon agreeably low delightfully disgusting and at
the same time eminently pleasing and pathetic may properly be set down
here

And though it may be said with some considerable show of reason that
agreeably low and delightfully disgusting characters have already been
treated both copiously and ably by some eminent writers of the present
and indeed of future ages though to tread in the footsteps of
the immortal FAGIN requires a genius of inordinate stride and to go
arobbing after the late though deathless TURPIN the renowned
JACK SHEPPARD or the embryo DUVAL may be impossible and not an
infringement but a wasteful indication of illwill towards the eighth
commandment though it may on the one hand be asserted that only vain
coxcombs would dare to write on subjects already described by men really
and deservedly eminent on the other hand that these subjects have been
described so fully that nothing more can be said about them on the
third hand allowing for the sake of argument three hands to one
figure of speech that the public has heard so much of them as to
be quite tired of rogues thieves cutthroats and Newgate
altogetherthough all these objections may be urged and each is
excellent yet we intend to take a few more pages from the Old Bailey
Calendar to bless the public with one more draught from the Stone
Jugyet awhile to listen hurdlemounted and riding down the
Oxford Road to the bland conversation of Jack Ketch and to hang with
him round the neck of his patient at the end of our and his history
We give the reader fair notice that we shall tickle him with a few such
scenes of villainy throatcutting and bodily suffering in general as
are not to be found no not in never mind comparisons for such are
odious

  This as your Ladyship is aware is the polite name for
 Her Majestys Prison of Newgate

In the year 1705 then whether it was that the Queen of England did
feel seriously alarmed at the notion that a French prince should occupy
the Spanish throne or whether she was tenderly attached to the Emperor
of Germany or whether she was obliged to fight out the quarrel of
William of Orange who made us pay and fight for his Dutch provinces
or whether poor old Louis Quatorze did really frighten her or whether
Sarah Jennings and her husband wanted to make a fight knowing how much
they should gain by itwhatever the reason was it was evident that
the war was to continue and there was almost as much soldiering
and recruiting parading pike and gunexercising flagflying
drumbeating powderblazing and military enthusiasm as we can all
remember in the year 1801 what time the Corsican upstart menaced our
shores A recruitingparty and captain of Cuttss regiment which had
been so mangled at Blenheim the year before were now in Warwickshire
and having their depot at Warwick the captain and his attendant the
corporal were used to travel through the country seeking for heroes to
fill up the gaps in Cuttss corpsand for adventures to pass away the
weary time of a country life

Our Captain Plume and Sergeant Kite it was at this time by the way
that those famous recruitingofficers were playing their pranks in
Shrewsbury were occupied very much in the same manner with Farquhars
heroes They roamed from Warwick to Stratford and from Stratford to
Birmingham persuading the swains of Warwickshire to leave the plough
for the Pike and despatching from time to time small detachments
of recruits to extend Marlboroughs lines and to act as food for the
hungry cannon at Ramillies and Malplaquet

Of those two gentlemen who are about to act a very important part in our
history one only was probably a native of Britainwe say probably
because the individual in question was himself quite uncertain and it
must be added entirely indifferent about his birthplace but speaking
the English language and having been during the course of his life
pretty generally engaged in the British service he had a tolerably
fair claim to the majestic title of Briton His name was Peter Brock
otherwise Corporal Brock of Lord Cuttss regiment of dragoons he was
of age about fiftyseven even that point has never been ascertained
in height about five feet six inches in weight nearly thirteen stone
with a chest that the celebrated Leitch himself might envy an arm
that was like an operadancers leg a stomach so elastic that it would
accommodate itself to any given or stolen quantity of food a great
aptitude for strong liquors a considerable skill in singing chansons de
table of not the most delicate kind he was a lover of jokes of which
he made many and passably bad when pleased simply coarse boisterous
and jovial when angry a perfect demon bullying cursing storming
fighting as is sometimes the wont with gentlemen of his cloth and
education

Mr Brock was strictly what the Marquis of Rodil styled himself in a
proclamation to his soldiers after running away a hijo de la guerraa
child of war Not seven cities but one or two regiments might contend
for the honour of giving him birth for his mother whose name he took
had acted as campfollower to a Royalist regiment had then obeyed the
Parliamentarians died in Scotland when Monk was commanding in that
country and the first appearance of Mr Brock in a public capacity
displayed him as a fifer in the Generals own regiment of Coldstreamers
when they marched from Scotland to London and from a republic at once
into a monarchy Since that period Brock had been always with the army
he had had too some promotion for he spake of having a command at the
battle of the Boyne though probably as he never mentioned the fact
upon the losing side The very year before this narrative commences
he had been one of Mordaunts forlorn hope at Schellenberg for which
service he was promised a pair of colours he lost them however and
was almost shot but fate did not ordain that his career should close
in that way for drunkenness and insubordination immediately after the
battle but having in some measure reinstated himself by a display
of much gallantry at Blenheim it was found advisable to send him to
England for the purposes of recruiting and remove him altogether from
the regiment where his gallantry only rendered the example of his riot
more dangerous

Mr Brocks commander was a slim young gentleman of twentysix about
whom there was likewise a history if one would take the trouble to
inquire He was a Bavarian by birth his mother being an English lady
and enjoyed along with a dozen other brothers the title of count eleven
of these of course were penniless one or two were priests one a
monk six or seven in various military services and the elder at home
at Schloss Galgenstein breeding horses hunting wild boars swindling
tenants living in a great house with small means obliged to be sordid
at home all the year to be splendid for a month at the capital as
is the way with many other noblemen Our young count Count Gustavus
Adolphus Maximilian von Galgenstein had been in the service of the
French as page to a nobleman then of His Majestys gardes du corps
then a lieutenant and captain in the Bavarian service and when after
the battle of Blenheim two regiments of Germans came over to the
winning side Gustavus Adolphus Maximilian found himself among them and
at the epoch when this story commences had enjoyed English pay for a
year or more It is unnecessary to say how he exchanged into his present
regiment how it appeared that before her marriage handsome John
Churchill had known the young gentlemans mother when they were both
penniless hangerson at Charles the Seconds courtit is we say
quite useless to repeat all the scandal of which we are perfectly
masters and to trace step by step the events of his history Here
however was Gustavus Adolphus in a small inn in a small village of
Warwickshire on an autumn evening in the year 1705 and at the very
moment when this history begins he and Mr Brock his corporal and
friend were seated at a round table before the kitchenfire while a
small groom of the establishment was leading up and down on the
village green before the inn door two black glossy longtailed
barrelbellied thickflanked archnecked Romannosed Flanders horses
which were the property of the two gentlemen now taking their ease at
the Bugle Inn The two gentlemen were seated at their ease at the inn
table drinking mountainwine and if the reader fancies from the sketch
which we have given of their lives or from his own blindness and belief
in the perfectibility of human nature that the sun of that autumn
evening shone upon any two men in county or city at desk or harvest at
Court or at Newgate drunk or sober who were greater rascals than
Count Gustavus Galgenstein and Corporal Peter Brock he is egregiously
mistaken and his knowledge of human nature is not worth a fig If they
had not been two prominent scoundrels what earthly business should we
have in detailing their histories What would the public care for
them Who would meddle with dull virtue humdrum sentiment or stupid
innocence when vice agreeable vice is the only thing which the
readers of romances care to hear

The little horseboy who was leading the two black Flanders horses up
and down the green might have put them in the stable for any good that
the horses got by the gentle exercise which they were now taking in the
cool evening air as their owners had not ridden very far or very hard
and there was not a hair turned of their sleek shining coats but the
lad had been especially ordered so to walk the horses about until he
received further commands from the gentlemen reposing in the Bugle
kitchen and the idlers of the village seemed so pleased with the
beasts and their smart saddles and shining bridles that it would have
been a pity to deprive them of the pleasure of contemplating such an
innocent spectacle Over the Counts horse was thrown a fine red cloth
richly embroidered in yellow worsted a very large counts coronet and a
cipher at the four corners of the covering and under this might be
seen a pair of gorgeous silver stirrups and above it a couple of
silvermounted pistols reposing in bearskin holsters the bit was silver
too and the horses head was decorated with many smart ribbons Of the
Corporals steed suffice it to say that the ornaments were in brass
as bright though not perhaps so valuable as those which decorated the
Captains animal The boys who had been at play on the green first
paused and entered into conversation with the horseboy then the
village matrons followed and afterwards sauntering by ones and twos
came the village maidens who love soldiers as flies love treacle
presently the males began to arrive and lo the parson of the parish
taking his evening walk with Mrs Dobbs and the four children his
offspring at length joined himself to his flock

To this audience the little ostler explained that the animals belonged
to two gentlemen now reposing at the Bugle one young with gold
hair the other old with grizzled locks both in red coats both in
jackboots putting the house into a bustle and calling for the best
He then discoursed to some of his own companions regarding the merits of
the horses and the parson a learned man explained to the villagers
that one of the travellers must be a count or at least had a counts
horsecloth pronounced that the stirrups were of real silver and
checked the impetuosity of his son William Nassau Dobbs who was for
mounting the animals and who expressed a longing to fire off one of the
pistols in the holsters

As this family discussion was taking place the gentlemen whose
appearance had created so much attention came to the door of the inn
and the elder and stouter was seen to smile at his companion after
which he strolled leisurely over the green and seemed to examine
with much benevolent satisfaction the assemblage of villagers who were
staring at him and the quadrupeds

Mr Brock when he saw the parsons band and cassock took off his
beaver reverently and saluted the divine I hope your reverence wont
baulk the little fellow said he I think I heard him calling out for
a ride and whether he should like my horse or his Lordships horse I
am sure it is all one Dont be afraid sir the horses are not tired
we have only come seventy mile today and Prince Eugene once rode a
matter of fiftytwo leagues a hundred and fifty miles sir upon that
horse between sunrise and sunset

Gracious powers on which horse said Doctor Dobbs very solemnly

On THIS siron mine Corporal Brock of Cuttss black gelding
William of Nassau The Prince sir gave it me after Blenheim fight
for I had my own legs carried away by a cannonball just as I cut down
two of Sauerkrauters regiment who had made the Prince prisoner

Your own legs sir said the Doctor Gracious goodness this is more
and more astonishing

No no not my own legs my horses I mean sir and the Prince gave me
William of Nassau that very day

To this no direct reply was made but the Doctor looked at Mrs Dobbs
and Mrs Dobbs and the rest of the children at her eldest son who
grinned and said Isnt it wonderful The Corporal to this answered
nothing but resuming his account pointed to the other horse and said
THAT horse sirgood as mine isthat horse with the silver stirrups
is his Excellencys horse Captain Count Maximilian Gustavus Adolphus
von Galgenstein captain of horse and of the Holy Roman Empire he
lifted here his hat with much gravity and all the crowd even to
the parson did likewise We call him George of Denmark sir in
compliment to Her Majestys husband he is Blenheim too sir Marshal
Tallard rode him on that day and you know how HE was taken prisoner by
the Count

George of Denmark Marshal Tallard William of Nassau this is strange
indeed most wonderful Why sir little are you aware that there are
before you AT THIS MOMENT two other living beings who bear these
venerated names My boys stand forward Look here sir these children
have been respectively named after our late sovereign and the husband of
our present Queen

And very good names too sir ay and very noble little fellows too
and I propose that with your reverence and your ladyships leave
William Nassau here shall ride on George of Denmark and George of
Denmark shall ride on William of Nassau

When this speech of the Corporals was made the whole crowd set up a
loyal hurrah and with much gravity the two little boys were lifted up
into the saddles and the Corporal leading one entrusted the other to
the horseboy and so together marched stately up and down the green

The popularity which Mr Brock gained by this manoeuvre was very great
but with regard to the names of the horses and children which coincided
so extraordinarily it is but fair to state that the christening of the
quadrupeds had only taken place about two minutes before the dragoons
appearance on the green For if the fact must be confessed he while
seated near the inn window had kept a pretty wistful eye upon all going
on without and the horses marching thus to and fro for the wonderment
of the village were only placards or advertisements for the riders

There was besides the boy now occupied with the horses and the
landlord and landlady of the Bugle Inn another person connected with
that establishmenta very smart handsome vain giggling servantgirl
about the age of sixteen who went by the familiar name of Cat and
attended upon the gentlemen in the parlour while the landlady was
employed in cooking their supper in the kitchen This young person had
been educated in the village poorhouse and having been pronounced
by Doctor Dobbs and the schoolmaster the idlest dirtiest and most
passionate little minx with whom either had ever had to do she was
after receiving a very small portion of literary instruction indeed
it must be stated that the young lady did not know her letters bound
apprentice at the age of nine years to Mrs Score her relative and
landlady of the Bugle Inn

If Miss Cat or Catherine Hall was a slattern and a minx Mrs Score
was a far superior shrew and for the seven years of her apprenticeship
the girl was completely at her mistresss mercy Yet though wondrously
stingy jealous and violent while her maid was idle and extravagant
and her husband seemed to abet the girl Mrs Score put up with the
wenchs airs idleness and caprices without ever wishing to dismiss
her from the Bugle The fact is that Miss Catherine was a great
beauty and for about two years since her fame had begun to spread
the custom of the inn had also increased vastly When there was a debate
whether the farmers on their way from market would take tother pot
Catherine by appearing with it would straightway cause the liquor to
be swallowed and paid for and when the traveller who proposed riding
that night and sleeping at Coventry or Birmingham was asked by Miss
Catherine whether he would like a fire in his bedroom he generally was
induced to occupy it although he might before have vowed to Mrs Score
that he would not for a thousand guineas be absent from home that night
The girl had too halfadozen lovers in the village and these were
bound in honour to spend their pence at the alehouse she inhabited O
woman lovely woman what strong resolves canst thou twist round thy
little finger what gunpowder passions canst thou kindle with a single
sparkle of thine eye what lies and fribble nonsense canst thou make us
listen to as they were gospel truth or splendid wit above all what bad
liquor canst thou make us swallow when thou puttest a kiss within the
cupand we are content to call the poison wine

The mountainwine at the Bugle was in fact execrable but Mrs Cat
who served it to the two soldiers made it so agreeable to them that
they found it a passable even a pleasant task to swallow the contents
of a second bottle The miracle had been wrought instantaneously on her
appearance for whereas at that very moment the Count was employed in
cursing the wine the landlady the winegrower and the English nation
generally when the young woman entered and choosing so to
interpret the oaths said Coming your honour I think your honour
calledGustavus Adolphus whistled stared at her very hard and
seeming quite dumbstricken by her appearance contented himself by
swallowing a whole glass of mountain by way of reply

Mr Brock was however by no means so confounded as his captain he was
thirty years older than the latter and in the course of fifty years of
military life had learned to look on the most dangerous enemy or the
most beautiful woman with the like daring devilmaycare determination
to conquer

My dear Mary then said that gentleman his honour is a lord as good
as a lord that is for all he allows such humble fellows as I am to
drink with him

Catherine dropped a low curtsey and said Well I dont know if you
are joking a poor country girl as all you soldier gentlemen do but his
honour LOOKS like a lord though I never see one to be sure

Then said the Captain gathering courage how do you know I look
like one pretty Mary

Pretty Catherine I mean Catherine if you please sir

Here Mr Brock burst into a roar of laughter and shouting with many
oaths that she was right at first invited her to give him what he
called a buss

Pretty Catherine turned away from him at this request and muttered
something about Keep your distance low fellow buss indeed poor
country girl etc etc placing herself as if for protection on the
side of the Captain That gentleman looked also very angry but whether
at the sight of innocence so outraged or the insolence of the Corporal
for daring to help himself first we cannot say Hark ye Mr Brock
he cried very fiercely I will suffer no such liberties in my presence
remember it is only my condescension which permits you to share my
bottle in this way take care I dont give you instead a taste of my
cane So saying he in a protecting manner placed one hand round
Mrs Catherines waist holding the other clenched very near to the
Corporals nose

Mrs Catherine for HER share of this action of the Counts dropped
another curtsey and said Thank you my Lord But Galgensteins threat
did not appear to make any impression on Mr Brock as indeed there was
no reason that it should for the Corporal at a combat of fisticuffs
could have pounded his commander into a jelly in ten minutes so he
contented himself by saying Well noble Captain theres no harm done
it IS an honour for poor old Peter Brock to be at table with you and I
AM sorry sure enough

In truth Peter I believe thou art thou hast good reason eh Peter
But never fear man had I struck thee I never would have hurt thee

I KNOW you would not replied Brock laying his hand on his heart
with much gravity and so peace was made and healths were drunk Miss
Catherine condescended to put her lips to the Captains glass who swore
that the wine was thus converted into nectar and although the girl had
not previously heard of that liquor she received the compliment as a
compliment and smiled and simpered in return

The poor thing had never before seen anybody so handsome or so finely
dressed as the Count and in the simplicity of her coquetry allowed
her satisfaction to be quite visible Nothing could be more clumsy than
the gentlemans mode of complimenting her but for this perhaps his
speeches were more effective than others more delicate would have been
and though she said to each Oh now my Lord and La Captain how
can you flatter one so and Your honours laughing at me and made
such polite speeches as are used on these occasions it was manifest
from the flutter and blush and the grin of satisfaction which lighted
up the buxom features of the little country beauty that the Counts
first operations had been highly successful When following up his
attack he produced from his neck a small locket which had been given
him by a Dutch lady at the Brill and begged Miss Catherine to wear it
for his sake and chucked her under the chin and called her his little
rosebud it was pretty clear how things would go anybody who could see
the expression of Mr Brocks countenance at this event might judge of
the progress of the irresistible HighDutch conqueror

Being of a very vain communicative turn our fair barmaid gave her two
companions not only a pretty long account of herself but of many other
persons in the village whom she could perceive from the window opposite
to which she stood Yes your honour said shemy Lord I mean
sixteen last March though theres a many girl in the village that at
my age is quite chits Theres Polly Randall now that redhaired girl
along with Thomas Curtis shes seventeen if shes a day though he is
the very first sweetheart she has had Well as I am saying I was bred
up here in the villagefather and mother died very young and I was
left a poor orphanwell bless us if Thomas havent kissed herto
the care of Mrs Score my aunt who has been a mother to mea
stepmother you knowand Ive been to Stratford fair and to Warwick
many a time and theres two people who have offered to marry me and
ever so many who want to and I wont have noneonly a gentleman
as Ive always said not a poor clodpole like Tom there with the red
waistcoat he was one that asked me nor a drunken fellow like Sam
Blacksmith yonder him whose wife has got the black eye but a real
gentleman like

Like whom my dear said the Captain encouraged

La sir how can you Why like our squire Sir John who rides in
such a mortal fine gold coach or at least like the parson Doctor
Dobbsthats he in the black gown walking with Madam Dobbs in red

And are those his children

Yes two girls and two boys and only think he calls one William
Nassau and one George Denmarkisnt it odd And from the parson Mrs
Catherine went on to speak of several humble personages of the village
community who as they are not necessary to our story need not be
described at full length It was when from the window Corporal Brock
saw the altercation between the worthy divine and his son respecting
the latters ride that he judged it a fitting time to step out on the
green and to bestow on the two horses those famous historical names
which we have just heard applied to them

Mr Brocks diplomacy was as we have stated quite successful for
when the parsons boys had ridden and retired along with their mamma and
papa other young gentlemen of humbler rank in the village were placed
upon George of Denmark and William of Nassau the Corporal joking
and laughing with all the grownup people The women in spite of Mr
Brocks age his red nose and a certain squint of his eye vowed the
Corporal was a jewel of a man and among the men his popularity was
equally great

How much dost thee get Thomas Clodpole said Mr Brock to a
countryman he was the man whom Mrs Catherine had described as her
suitor who had laughed loudest at some of his jokes how much dost
thee get for a weeks work now

Mr Clodpole whose name was really Bullock stated that his wages
amounted to three shillings and a puddn

Three shillings and a puddnmonstrousand for this you toil like a
galleyslave as I have seen them in Turkey and Americaay gentlemen
and in the country of Prester John You shiver out of bed on icy winter
mornings to break the ice for Ball and Dapple to drink

Yes indeed said the person addressed who seemed astounded at the
extent of the Corporals information

Or you clean pigsty and take dung down to meadow or you act watchdog
and tend sheep or you sweep a scythe over a great field of grass and
when the sun has scorched the eyes out of your head and sweated the
flesh off your bones and wellnigh fried the soul out of your body
you go home to whatthree shillings a week and a puddn Do you get
pudding every day

No only Sundays

Do you get money enough

No sure

Do you get beer enough

Oh no NEVER said Mr Bullock quite resolutely

Worthy Clodpole give us thy hand it shall have beer enough this day
or my names not Corporal Brock Heres the money boy there are twenty
pieces in this purse and how do you think I got em and how do you
think I shall get others when these are goneby serving Her Sacred
Majesty to be sure long life to her and down with the French King

Bullock a few of the men and two or three of the boys piped out
an hurrah in compliment to this speech of the Corporals but it
was remarked that the greater part of the crowd drew backthe women
whispering ominously to them and looking at the Corporal

I see ladies what it is said he You are frightened and think I
am a crimp come to steal your sweethearts away What call Peter Brock a
doubledealer I tell you what boys Jack Churchill himself has shaken
this hand and drunk a pot with me do you think hed shake hands with
a rogue Heres Tummas Clodpole has never had beer enough and here am
I will stand treat to him and any other gentleman am I good enough
company for him I have money look you and like to spend it what
should _I_ be doing dirty actions forhay Tummas

A satisfactory reply to this query was not of course expected by the
Corporal nor uttered by Mr Bullock and the end of the dispute was
that he and three or four of the rustic bystanders were quite convinced
of the good intentions of their new friend and accompanied him back
to the Bugle to regale upon the promised beer Among the Corporals
guests was one young fellow whose dress would show that he was somewhat
better to do in the world than Clodpole and the rest of the sunburnt
ragged troop who were marching towards the alehouse This man was the
only one of his hearers who perhaps was sceptical as to the truth of
his stories but as soon as Bullock accepted the invitation to drink
John Hayes the carpenter for such was his name and profession said
Well Thomas if thou goest I will go too

I know thee wilt said Thomas thoult goo anywhere Catty Hall is
provided thou canst goo for nothing

Nay I have a penny to spend as good as the Corporal here

A penny to KEEP you mean for all your love for the lass at the
Bugle did thee ever spend a shilling in the house Thee wouldnt go
now but that I am going too and the Captain here stands treat

Come come gentlemen no quarrelling said Mr Brock If this pretty
fellow will join us amen say I theres lots of liquor and plenty
of money to pay the score Comrade Tummas give us thy arm Mr Hayes
youre a hearty cock I make no doubt and all such are welcome Come
along my gentleman farmers Mr Brock shall have the honour to pay for
you all And with this Corporal Brock accompanied by Messrs Hayes
Bullock Blacksmith Bakersboy Butcher and one or two others
adjourned to the inn the horses being at the same time conducted to
the stable

Although we have in this quiet way and without any flourishing of
trumpets or beginning of chapters introduced Mr Hayes to the public
and although at first sight a sneaking carpenters boy may seem hardly
worthy of the notice of an intelligent reader who looks for a good
cutthroat or highwayman for a hero or a pickpocket at the very least
this gentlemans words and actions should be carefully studied by the
public as he is destined to appear before them under very polite and
curious circumstances during the course of this history The speech of
the rustic Juvenal Mr Clodpole had seemed to infer that Hayes was at
once careful of his money and a warm admirer of Mrs Catherine of the
Bugle and both the charges were perfectly true Hayess father
was reported to be a man of some substance and young John who was
performing his apprenticeship in the village did not fail to talk very
big of his pretensions to fortuneof his entering at the close of his
indentures into partnership with his fatherand of the comfortable
farm and house over which Mrs John Hayes whoever she might be would
one day preside Thus next to the barber and butcher and above even
his own master Mr Hayes took rank in the village and it must not be
concealed that his representation of wealth had made some impression
upon Mrs Hall toward whom the young gentleman had cast the eyes of
affection If he had been tolerably welllooking and not pale rickety
and feeble as he was if even he had been ugly but withal a man of
spirit it is probable the girls kindness for him would have been
much more decided But he was a poor weak creature not to compare
with honest Thomas Bullock by at least nine inches and so notoriously
timid selfish and stingy that there was a kind of shame in receiving
his addresses openly and what encouragement Mrs Catherine gave him
could only be in secret

But no mortal is wise at all times and the fact was that Hayes who
cared for himself intensely had set his heart upon winning Catherine
and loved her with a desperate greedy eagerness and desire of
possession which makes passions for women often so fierce and
unreasonable among very cold and selfish men His parents whose
frugality he had inherited had tried in vain to wean him from this
passion and had made many fruitless attempts to engage him with women
who possessed money and desired husbands but Hayes was for a wonder
quite proof against their attractions and though quite ready
to acknowledge the absurdity of his love for a penniless alehouse
servantgirl nevertheless persisted in it doggedly I know Im a
fool said he and whats more the girl does not care for me but
marry her I must or I think I shall just die and marry her I will
For very much to the credit of Miss Catherines modesty she had
declared that marriage was with her a sine qua non and had dismissed
with the loudest scorn and indignation all propositions of a less
proper nature

Poor Thomas Bullock was another of her admirers and had offered to
marry her but three shillings a week and a puddn was not to the girls
taste and Thomas had been scornfully rejected Hayes had also made her
a direct proposal Catherine did not say no she was too prudent but
she was young and could wait she did not care for Mr Hayes yet enough
to marry himit did not seem indeed in the young womans nature to
care for anybodyand she gave her adorer flatteringly to understand
that if nobody better appeared in the course of a few years she might
be induced to become Mrs Hayes It was a dismal prospect for the
poor fellow to live upon the hope of being one day Mrs Catherines
pisaller

In the meantime she considered herself free as the wind and permitted
herself all the innocent gaieties which that chartered libertine a
coquette can take She flirted with all the bachelors widowers and
married men in a manner which did extraordinary credit to her years
and let not the reader fancy such pastimes unnatural at her early age
The ladiesHeaven bless themare as a general rule coquettes from
babyhood upwards Little SHES of three years old play little airs and
graces upon small heroes of five simpering misses of nine make attacks
upon young gentlemen of twelve and at sixteen a wellgrown girl under
encouraging circumstancessay she is pretty in a family of ugly elder
sisters or an only child and heiress or a humble wench at a country
inn like our fair Catherineis at the very pink and prime of her
coquetry they will jilt you at that age with an ease and arch infantine
simplicity that never can be surpassed in maturer years

Miss Catherine then was a franche coquette and Mr John Hayes was
miserable His life was passed in a storm of mean passions and bitter
jealousies and desperate attacks upon the indifferencerock of Mrs
Catherines heart which not all his tempest of love could beat down O
cruel cruel pangs of love unrequited Mean rogues feel them as well as
great heroes Lives there the man in Europe who has not felt them many
timeswho has not knelt and fawned and supplicated and wept and
cursed and raved all in vain and passed long wakeful nights with
ghosts of dead hopes for company shadows of buried remembrances that
glide out of their graves of nights and whisper We are dead now
but we WERE once and we made you happy and we come now to mock
youdespair O lover despair and dieO cruel pangsdismal
nightsNow a sly demon creeps under your nightcap and drops into
your ear those soft hopebreathing sweet words uttered on the
wellremembered evening there in the drawer of your dressingtable
along with the razors and Macassar oil lies the dead flower that
Lady Amelia Wilhelmina wore in her bosom on the night of a certain
ballthe corpse of a glorious hope that seemed once as if it would live
for ever so strong was it so full of joy and sunshine there in
your writingdesk among a crowd of unpaid bills is the dirty scrap of
paper thimblesealed which came in company with a pair of muffetees of
her knitting she was a butchers daughter and did all she could poor
thing begging you would ware them at collidge and think of her
whomarried a publichouse three weeks afterwards and cares for you
no more now than she does for the potboy But why multiply instances
or seek to depict the agony of poor meanspirited John Hayes No mistake
can be greater than that of fancying such great emotions of love are
only felt by virtuous or exalted men depend upon it Love like Death
plays havoc among the pauperum tabernas and sports with rich and poor
wicked and virtuous alike I have often fancied for instance on
seeing the haggard pale young oldclothesman who wakes the echoes of
our street with his nasal cry of CloI have often I said fancied
that besides the load of exuvial coats and breeches under which
he staggers there is another weight on himan atrior cura at his
tailand while his unshorn lips and nose together are performing that
mocking boisterous Jackindifferent cry of Clo clo who knows
what woeful utterances are crying from the heart within There he is
chaffering with the footman at No 7 about an old dressinggown you
think his whole soul is bent only on the contest about the garment
Psha there is perhaps some faithless girl in Holywell Street who
fills up his heart and that desultory Jewboy is a peripatetic hell
Take another instancetake the man in the beefshop in Saint Martins
Court There he is to all appearances quite calm before the same round
of beeffrom morning till sundownfor hundreds of years very likely
Perhaps when the shutters are closed and all the world tired and
silent there is HE silent but untiredcutting cutting cutting You
enter you get your meat to your liking you depart and quite unmoved
on on he goes reaping ceaselessly the Great Harvest of Beef You would
fancy that if Passion ever failed to conquer it had in vain assailed
the calm bosom of THAT MAN I doubt it and would give much to know his
history

Who knows what furious Aetnaflames are raging underneath the surface of
that calm fleshmountainwho can tell me that that calmness itself is
not DESPAIR

 

The reader if he does not now understand why it was that Mr Hayes
agreed to drink the Corporals proffered beer had better just read the
foregoing remarks over again and if he does not understand THEN why
small praise to his brains Hayes could not bear that Mr Bullock should
have a chance of seeing and perhaps making love to Mrs Catherine in
his absence and though the young woman never diminished her coquetries
but on the contrary rather increased them in his presence it was
still a kind of dismal satisfaction to be miserable in her company

On this occasion the disconsolate lover could be wretched to his
hearts content for Catherine had not a word or a look for him but
bestowed all her smiles upon the handsome stranger who owned the black
horse As for poor Tummas Bullock his passion was never violent and
he was content in the present instance to sigh and drink beer He sighed
and drank sighed and drank and drank again until he had swallowed so
much of the Corporals liquor as to be induced to accept a guinea from
his purse also and found himself on returning to reason and sobriety
a soldier of Queen Annes

But oh fancy the agonies of Mr Hayes when seated with the Corporals
friends at one end of the kitchen he saw the Captain at the place of
honour and the smiles which the fair maid bestowed upon him when as
she lightly whisked past him with the Captains supper she pointing
to the locket that once reposed on the breast of the Dutch lady at the
Brill looked archly on Hayes and said See John what his Lordship
has given me and when Johns face became green and purple with
rage and jealousy Mrs Catherine laughed ten times louder and cried
Coming my Lord in a voice of shrill triumph that bored through the
soul of Mr John Hayes and left him gasping for breath

On Catherines other lover Mr Thomas this coquetry had no effect he
and two comrades of his had by this time quite fallen under the spell
of the Corporal and hope glory strong beer Prince Eugene pair of
colours more strong beer her blessed Majesty plenty more strong beer
and such subjects martial and bacchic whirled through their dizzy
brains at a railroad pace

And now if there had been a couple of experienced reporters present at
the Bugle Inn they might have taken down a conversation on love
and warthe two themes discussed by the two parties occupying the
kitchenwhich as the parts were sung together duetwise formed
together some very curious harmonies Thus while the Captain was
whispering the softest nothings the Corporal was shouting the fiercest
combats of the war and like the gentleman at Penelopes table on it
exiguo pinxit praelia tota bero For example

CAPTAIN What do you say to a silver trimming pretty Catherine Dont
you think a scarlet ridingcloak handsomely laced would become you
wonderfully welland a grey hat with a blue featherand a pretty nag
to ride onand all the soldiers to present arms as you pass and say
There goes the Captains lady What do you think of a sidebox at
Lincolns Inn playhouse or of standing up to a minuet with my Lord
Marquis at

CORPORAL The ball sir ran right up his elbow and was found the next
day by Surgeon Splinter of ourswhere do you think sirupon my
honour as a gentleman it came out of the nape of his

CAPTAIN Necklaceand a sweet pair of diamond earrings mayhapand a
little shower of patches which ornament a ladys face wondrouslyand
a leetle rougethough egad such peachcheeks as yours dont want
itfie Mrs Catherine I should think the birds must come and peck at
them as if they were fruit

CORPORAL Over the wall and threeandtwenty of our fellows jumped
after me By the Pope of Rome friend Tummas that was a dayHad you
seen how the Mounseers looked when fourandtwenty rampaging hedevils
sword and pistol cut and thrust pellmell came tumbling into the
redoubt Why sir we left in three minutes as many artillerymens heads
as there were cannonballs It was Ah sacre D you take that
O mon Dieu Run him through Ventrebleu and it WAS ventrebleu
with him I warrant you for bleu in the French language means
through and ventrewhy you see ventre means

CAPTAIN Waists which are worn now excessive long and for the hoops
if you COULD but see themstap my vitals my dear but there was a lady
at Warwicks Assembly she came in one of my Lords coaches who had a
hoop as big as a tent you might have dined under it comfortablyha
ha pon my faith now

CORPORAL And there we found the Duke of Marlborough seated along with
Marshal Tallard who was endeavouring to drown his sorrow over a cup of
Johannisberger wine and a good drink too my lads only not to compare
to Warwick beer Who was the man who has done this said our noble
General I stepped up How many heads was it says he that you cut
off Nineteen says I besides wounding several When he heard it
Mr Hayes you dont drink Im blest if he didnt burst into tears
Noble noble fellow says he Marshal you must excuse me if I am
pleased to hear of the destruction of your countrymen Noble noble
fellowheres a hundred guineas for you Which sum he placed in my
hand Nay says the Marshal the man has done his duty and pulling
out a magnificent gold diamondhilted snuffbox he gave me

MR BULLOCK What a goold snuffbox Wauns but thee WAST in luck
Corporal

CORPORAL No not the snuffbox butA PINCH OF SNUFFha harun me
through the body if he didnt Could you but have seen the smile on
Jack Churchills grave face at this piece of generosity So beckoning
Colonel Cadogan up to him he pinched his Ear and whispered

CAPTAIN May I have the honour to dance a minuet with your Ladyship
The whole room was in titters at Jacks blunder for as you know very
well poor Lady Susan HAS A WOODEN LEG Ha ha fancy a minuet and a
wooden leg hey my dear

MRS CATHERINE Gigglegigglegiggle he he he Oh Captain you
rogue you

SECOND TABLE Haw haw haw Well you be a foony mon Sergeant zure
enoff

 

This little specimen of the conversation must be sufficient It will
show pretty clearly that EACH of the two military commanders was
conducting his operations with perfect success Three of the detachment
of five attacked by the Corporal surrendered to him Mr Bullock
namely who gave in at a very early stage of the evening and
ignominiously laid down his arms under the table after standing not
more than a dozen volleys of beer Mr Blacksmiths boy and a labourer
whose name we have not been able to learn Mr Butcher himself was on
the point of yielding when he was rescued by the furious charge of a
detachment that marched to his relief his wife namely who with two
squalling children rushed into the Bugle boxed Butchers ears and
kept up such a tremendous fire of oaths and screams upon the Corporal
that he was obliged to retreat Fixing then her claws into Mr Butchers
hair she proceeded to drag him out of the premises and thus Mr Brock
was overcome His attack upon John Hayes was a still greater failure
for that young man seemed to be invincible by drink if not by love
and at the end of the drinkingbout was a great deal more cool than
the Corporal himself to whom he wished a very polite goodevening as
calmly he took his hat to depart He turned to look at Catherine to be
sure and then he was not quite so calm but Catherine did not give any
reply to his goodnight She was seated at the Captains table playing
at cribbage with him and though Count Gustavus Maximilian lost every
game he won more than he lostsly fellowand Mrs Catherine was no
match for him

It is to be presumed that Hayes gave some information to Mrs Score
the landlady for on leaving the kitchen he was seen to linger for a
moment in the bar and very soon after Mrs Catherine was called away
from her attendance on the Count who when he asked for a sack and
toast was furnished with those articles by the landlady herself and
during the halfhour in which he was employed in consuming this drink
Monsieur de Galgenstein looked very much disturbed and out of humour
and cast his eyes to the door perpetually but no Catherine came At
last very sulkily he desired to be shown to bed and walked as well as
he could for to say truth the noble Count was by this time somewhat
unsteady on his legs to his chamber It was Mrs Score who showed
him to it and closed the curtains and pointed triumphantly to the
whiteness of the sheets

Its a very comfortable room said she though not the best in the
house which belong of right to your Lordships worship but our
best room has two beds and Mr Corporal is in that locked and
doublelocked with his three tipsy recruits But your honour will find
this here bed comfortable and wellaired Ive slept in it myself this
eighteen years

What my good woman you are going to sit up eh Its cruel hard on
you madam

Sit up my Lord bless you no I shall have half of our Cats bed as
I always do when theres company And with this Mrs Score curtseyed
and retired

Very early the next morning the active landlady and her bustling
attendant had prepared the ale and bacon for the Corporal and his three
converts and had set a nice white cloth for the Captains breakfast
The young blacksmith did not eat with much satisfaction but Mr Bullock
and his friend betrayed no sign of discontent except such as may be
consequent upon an evenings carouse They walked very contentedly to be
registered before Doctor Dobbs who was also justice of the peace and
went in search of their slender bundles and took leave of their few
acquaintances without much regret for the gentlemen had been bred in
the workhouse and had not therefore a large circle of friends

It wanted only an hour of noon and the noble Count had not descended
The men were waiting for him and spent much of the Queens money
earned by the sale of their bodies overnight while thus expecting him
Perhaps Mrs Catherine expected him too for she had offered many times
to run upwith my Lords bootswith the hot waterto show Mr Brock
the way who sometimes condescended to officiate as barber But on all
these occasions Mrs Score had prevented her not scolding but with
much gentleness and smiling At last more gentle and smiling than ever
she came downstairs and said Catherine darling his honour the Count
is mighty hungry this morning and vows he could pick the wing of a
fowl Run down child to Farmer Briggs and get one pluck it
before you bring it you know and we will make his Lordship a pretty
breakfast

Catherine took up her basket and away she went by the backyard
through the stables There she heard the little horseboy whistling and
hissing after the manner of horseboys and there she learned that Mrs
Score had been inventing an ingenious story to have her out of the way
The ostler said he was just going to lead the two horses round to the
door The Corporal had been and they were about to start on the instant
for Stratford

The fact was that Count Gustavus Adolphus far from wishing to pick the
wing of a fowl had risen with a horror and loathing for everything in
the shape of food and for any liquor stronger than small beer Of this
he had drunk a cup and said he should ride immediately to Stratford
and when on ordering his horses he had asked politely of the landlady
why the d SHE always came up and why she did not send the girl
Mrs Score informed the Count that her Catherine was gone out for a walk
along with the young man to whom she was to be married and would not
be visible that day On hearing this the Captain ordered his horses
that moment and abused the wine the bed the house the landlady and
everything connected with the Bugle Inn

Out the horses came the little boys of the village gathered round the
recruits with bunches of ribands in their beavers appeared presently
Corporal Brock came swaggering out and slapping the pleased blacksmith
on the back bade him mount his horse while the boys hurrahd Then the
Captain came out gloomy and majestic to him Mr Brock made a military
salute which clumsily and with much grinning the recruits imitated
I shall walk on with these brave fellows your honour and meet you at
Stratford said the Corporal Good said the Captain as he
mounted The landlady curtseyed the children hurrahd more the little
horseboy who held the bridle with one hand and the stirrup with the
other and expected a crownpiece from such a noble gentleman got only
a kick and a curse as Count von Galgenstein shouted D you all
get out of the way and galloped off and John Hayes who had been
sneaking about the inn all the morning felt a weight off his heart when
he saw the Captain ride off alone

O foolish Mrs Score O dolt of a John Hayes If the landlady had
allowed the Captain and the maid to have their way and meet but for a
minute before recruits sergeant and all it is probable that no
harm would have been done and that this history would never have been
written

When Count von Galgenstein had ridden half a mile on the Stratford road
looking as black and dismal as Napoleon galloping from the romantic
village of Waterloo he espied a few score yards onwards at the
turn of the road a certain object which caused him to check his horse
suddenly brought a tingling red into his cheeks and made his heart to
go thumpthump against his side A young lass was sauntering slowly
along the footpath with a basket swinging from one hand and a bunch of
hedgeflowers in the other She stopped once or twice to add a fresh one
to her nosegay and might have seen him the Captain thought but
no she never looked directly towards him and still walked on Sweet
innocent she was singing as if none were near her voice went soaring
up to the clear sky and the Captain put his horse on the grass that
the sound of the hoofs might not disturb the music

 When the kine had given a pailful
 And the sheep came bleating home
 Poll who knew it would be healthful
 Went awalking out with Tom
 Hand in hand sir on the land sir
 As they walked to and fro
 Tom made jolly love to Polly
 But was answered no no no

The Captain had put his horse on the grass that the sound of his hoofs
might not disturb the music and now he pushed its head on to the bank
where straightway George of Denmark began chewing of such a salad
as grew there And now the Captain slid off stealthily and smiling
comically and hitching up his great jackboots and moving forward with
a jerking tiptoe step he just as she was trilling the last ooo
of the last no in the above poem of Tom DUrfey came up to her and
touching her lightly on the waist said

My dear your very humble servant

Mrs Catherine you know you have found her out long ago gave a scream
and a start and would have turned pale if she could As it was she
only shook all over and said

Oh sir how you DID frighten me

Frighten you my rosebud why run me through Id die rather than
frighten you Gad child tell me now am I so VERY frightful

Oh no your honour I didnt mean that only I wasnt thinking to meet
you here or that you would ride so early at all for if you please
sir I was going to fetch a chicken for your Lordships breakfast as
my mistress said you would like one and I thought instead of going to
Farmer Briggs down Birmingham way as she told me Id go to Farmer
Birds where the chickens is better sirmy Lord I mean

Said Id like a chicken for breakfast the old cat why I told her
I would not eat a morsel to save meI was so druI mean I ate such a
good supper last nightand I bade her to send me a pot of small beer
and to tell you to bring it and the wretch said you were gone out with
your sweetheart

What John Hayes the creature Oh what a naughty storytelling
woman

You had walked out with your sweetheart and I was not to see you
any more and I was mad with rage and ready to kill myself I was my
dear

Oh sir pray PRAY dont

For your sake my sweet angel

Yes for my sake if such a poor girl as me can persuade noble
gentlemen

Well then for YOUR sake I wont no Ill live but why live Hell
and fury if I do live Im miserable without you I amyou know I
amyou adorable beautiful cruel wicked Catherine

Catherines reply to this was La bless me I do believe your horse is
running away And so he was for having finished his meal in the hedge
he first looked towards his master and paused as it were irresolutely
then by a sudden impulse flinging up his tail and his hind legs he
scampered down the road

Mrs Hall ran lightly after the horse and the Captain after Mrs Hall
and the horse ran quicker and quicker every moment and might have led
them a long chasewhen lo debouching from a twist in the road came
the detachment of cavalry and infantry under Mr Brock The moment
he was out of sight of the village that gentleman had desired the
blacksmith to dismount and had himself jumped into the saddle
maintaining the subordination of his army by drawing a pistol and
swearing that he would blow out the brains of any person who attempted
to run When the Captains horse came near the detachment he paused and
suffered himself to be caught by Tummas Bullock who held him until the
owner and Mrs Catherine came up

Mr Bullock looked comically grave when he saw the pair but the
Corporal graciously saluted Mrs Catherine and said it was a fine day
for walking

La sir and so it is said she panting in a very pretty and
distressing way but not for RUNNING I do protesthaand vow that
I really can scarcely stand Im so tired of running after that naughty
naughty horse

How do Cattern said Thomas Zee I be going a zouldiering because
thee wouldnt have me And here Mr Bullock grinned Mrs Catherine
made no sort of reply but protested once more she should die of
running If the truth were told she was somewhat vexed at the arrival
of the Corporals detachment and had had very serious thoughts of
finding herself quite tired just as he came in sight

A sudden thought brought a smile of bright satisfaction in the Captains
eyes He mounted the horse which Tummas still held TIRED Mrs
Catherine said he and for my sake By heavens you shant walk a
step farther No you shall ride back with a guard of honour Back to
the village gentlemenrightabout face Show those fellows Corporal
how to rightabout face Now my dear mount behind me on Snowball hes
easy as a sedan Put your dear little foot on the toe of my boot There
nowupjump hurrah

THATS not the way Captain shouted out Thomas still holding on to
the rein as the horse began to move Thee woant goo with him will
thee Catty

But Mrs Catherine though she turned away her head never let go her
hold round the Captains waist and he swearing a dreadful oath at
Thomas struck him across the face and hands with his riding whip The
poor fellow who at the first cut still held on to the rein dropped it
at the second and as the pair galloped off sat down on the roadside
and fairly began to weep

MARCH you dog shouted out the Corporal a minute after And so he
did and when next he saw Mrs Catherine she WAS the Captains lady sure
enough and wore a grey hat with a blue feather and red ridingcoat
trimmed with silverlace But Thomas was then on a barebacked horse
which Corporal Brock was flanking round a ring and he was so occupied
looking between his horses ears that he had no time to cry then and at
length got the better of his attachment

 

This being a good opportunity for closing Chapter I we ought perhaps
to make some apologies to the public for introducing them to characters
that are so utterly worthless as we confess all our heroes with the
exception of Mr Bullock to be In this we have consulted nature and
history rather than the prevailing taste and the general manner of
authors The amusing novel of Ernest Maltravers for instance opens
with a seduction but then it is performed by people of the strictest
virtue on both sides and there is so much religion and philosophy in
the heart of the seducer so much tender innocence in the soul of the
seduced thatbless the little dearstheir very peccadilloes make
one interested in them and their naughtiness becomes quite sacred so
deliciously is it described Now if we ARE to be interested by rascally
actions let us have them with plain faces and let them be performed
not by virtuous philosophers but by rascals Another clever class of
novelists adopt the contrary system and create interest by making their
rascals perform virtuous actions Against these popular plans we here
solemnly appeal We say let your rogues in novels act like rogues
and your honest men like honest men dont let us have any juggling
and thimblerigging with virtue and vice so that at the end of three
volumes the bewildered reader shall not know which is which dont let
us find ourselves kindling at the generous qualities of thieves and
sympathising with the rascalities of noble hearts For our own part we
know what the public likes and have chosen rogues for our characters
and have taken a story from the Newgate Calendar which we hope to
follow out to edification Among the rogues at least we will have
nothing that shall be mistaken for virtues And if the British public
after calling for three or four editions shall give up not only our
rascals but the rascals of all other authors we shall be contentwe
shall apply to Government for a pension and think that our duty is
done



CHAPTER II IN WHICH ARE DEPICTED THE PLEASURES OF A SENTIMENTAL
ATTACHMENT


It will not be necessary for the purpose of this history to follow out
very closely all the adventures which occurred to Mrs Catherine from
the period when she quitted the Bugle and became the Captains lady
for although it would be just as easy to show as not that the young
woman by following the man of her heart had only yielded to an
innocent impulse and by remaining with him for a certain period had
proved the depth and strength of her affection for himalthough we
might make very tender and eloquent apologies for the error of both
parties the reader might possibly be disgusted at such descriptions
and such arguments which besides are already done to his hand in the
novel of Ernest Maltravers before mentioned

From the gentlemans manner towards Mrs Catherine and from his
brilliant and immediate success the reader will doubtless have
concluded in the first place that Gustavus Adolphus had not a very
violent affection for Mrs Cat in the second place that he was a
professional ladykiller and therefore likely at some period to resume
his profession thirdly and to conclude that a connection so begun
must in the nature of things be likely to end speedily

And so to do the Count justice it would if he had been allowed to
follow his own inclination entirely for as many young gentlemen will
and yet no praise to them in about a week he began to be indifferent
in a month to be weary in two months to be angry in three to proceed
to blows and curses and in short to repent most bitterly the hour
when he had ever been induced to present Mrs Catherine the toe of his
boot for the purpose of lifting her on to his horse

Egad said he to the Corporal one day when confiding his griefs to
Mr Brock I wish my toe had been cut off before ever it served as a
ladder to this little vixen

Or perhaps your honour would wish to kick her downstairs with it
delicately suggested Mr Brock

Kick her why the wench would hold so fast by the banisters that I
COULD not kick her down Mr Brock To tell you a bit of a secret I
HAVE tried as muchnot to kick herno no not kick her certainly
thats ungentlemanlybut to INDUCE her to go back to that cursed
pothouse where we fell in with her I have given her many hints

Oh yes I saw your honour give her one yesterdaywith a mug of beer
By the laws as the ale run all down her face and she clutched a knife
to run at you I dont think I ever saw such a shedevil That woman
will do for your honour some day if you provoke her

Do for ME No hang it Mr Brock never She loves every hair of my
head sir she worships me Corporal Egad yes she worships me and
would much sooner apply a knife to her own weasand than scratch my
little finger

I think she does said Mr Brock

Im sure of it said the Captain Women look you are like dogs
they like to be illtreated they like it sir I know they do I never
had anything to do with a woman in my life but I illtreated her and
she liked me the better

Mrs Hall ought to be VERY fond of you then sure enough said Mr
Corporal

Very fondha ha Corporal you wag youand so she IS very fond
Yesterday after the knifeandbeer sceneno wonder I threw the liquor
in her face it was so devlish flat that no gentleman could drink it
and I told her never to draw it till dinnertime

Oh it was enough to put an angel in a fury said Brock

Well yesterday after the knife business when you had got the carver
out of her hand off she flings to her bedroom will not eat a bit of
dinner forsooth and remains locked up for a couple of hours At
two oclock afternoon I was over a tankard out comes the little
shedevil her face pale her eyes bleared and the tip of her nose as
red as fire with sniffling and weeping Making for my hand Max says
she will you forgive me What says I Forgive a murderess
says I No curse me never Your cruelty will kill me sobbed she
Cruelty be hanged says I didnt you draw that beer an hour before
dinner She could say nothing to THIS you know and I swore that every
time she did so I would fling it into her face again Whereupon
back she flounced to her chamber where she wept and stormed until
nighttime

When you forgave her

I DID forgive her thats positive You see I had supped at the Rose
along with Tom Trippet and halfadozen pretty fellows and I had eased
a great fatheaded Warwickshire landjunkerwhat dye call himsquire
of forty pieces and Im devlish goodhumoured when Ive won and so
Cat and I made it up but Ive taught her never to bring me stale beer
againha ha

This conversation will explain a great deal better than any description
of ours however eloquent the state of things as between Count
Maximilian and Mrs Catherine and the feelings which they entertained
for each other The woman loved him that was the fact And as we have
shown in the previous chapter how John Hayes a meanspirited fellow
as ever breathed in respect of all other passions a pigmy was in the
passion of love a giant and followed Mrs Catherine with a furious
longing which might seem at the first to be foreign to his nature in
the like manner and playing at crosspurposes Mrs Hall had become
smitten of the Captain and as he said truly only liked him the better
for the brutality which she received at his hands For it is my opinion
madam that love is a bodily infirmity from which humankind can no more
escape than from smallpox and which attacks every one of us from the
first duke in the Peerage down to Jack Ketch inclusive which has no
respect for rank virtue or roguery in man but sets each in his turn
in a fever which breaks out the deuce knows how or why and raging its
appointed time fills each individual of the one sex with a blind
fury and longing for some one of the other who may be pure gentle
blueeyed beautiful and good or vile shrewish squinting
hunchbacked and hideous according to circumstances and luck which
dies away perhaps in the natural course if left to have its way
but which contradiction causes to rage more furiously than ever Is not
history from the Trojan war upwards and downwards full of instances of
such strange inexplicable passions Was not Helen by the most moderate
calculation ninety years of age when she went off with His Royal
Highness Prince Paris of Troy Was not Madame La Valliere illmade
bleareyed tallowcomplexioned scraggy and with hair like tow Was
not Wilkes the ugliest charmingest most successful man in the world
Such instances might be carried out so as to fill a volume but cui
bono Love is fate and not will its origin not to be explained its
progress irresistible and the best proof of this may be had at Bow
Street any day where if you ask any officer of the establishment how
they take most thieves he will tell you at the houses of the women
They must see the dear creatures though they hang for it they will
love though they have their necks in the halter And with regard to the
other position that illusage on the part of the man does not destroy
the affection of the woman have we not numberless policereports
showing how when a bystander would beat a husband for beating his wife
man and wife fall together on the interloper and punish him for his
meddling

These points then being settled to the satisfaction of all parties
the reader will not be disposed to question the assertion that Mrs Hall
had a real affection for the gallant Count and grew as Mr Brock was
pleased to say like a beefsteak more tender as she was thumped Poor
thing poor thing his flashy airs and smart looks had overcome her in
a single hour and no more is wanted to plunge into love over head and
ears no more is wanted to make a first love withand a womans first
love lasts FOR EVER a mans twentyfourth or twentyfifth is perhaps
the best you cant kill it do what you will it takes root and lives
and even grows never mind what the soil may be in which it is planted
or the bitter weather it must bearoften as one has seen a wallflower
growout of a stone

In the first weeks of their union the Count had at least been liberal
to her she had a horse and fine clothes and received abroad some of
those flattering attentions which she held at such high price He had
however some illluck at play or had been forced to pay some bills or
had some other satisfactory reason for being poor and his establishment
was very speedily diminished He argued that as Mrs Catherine had
been accustomed to wait on others all her life she might now wait upon
herself and him and when the incident of the beer arose she had
been for some time employed as the Counts housekeeper with unlimited
superintendence over his comfort his cellar his linen and such
matters as bachelors are delighted to make over to active female hands
To do the poor wretch justice she actually kept the mans menage in the
best order nor was there any point of extravagance with which she could
be charged except a little extravagance of dress displayed on the
very few occasions when he condescended to walk abroad with her and
extravagance of language and passion in the frequent quarrels they
had together Perhaps in such a connection as subsisted between this
precious couple these faults are inevitable on the part of the woman
She must be silly and vain and will pretty surely therefore be fond of
dress and she must disguise it as she will be perpetually miserable
and brooding over her fall which will cause her to be violent and
quarrelsome

Such at least was Mrs Hall and very early did the poor vain
misguided wretch begin to reap what she had sown

For a man remorse under these circumstances is perhaps uncommon
No stigma affixes on HIM for betraying a woman no bitter pangs of
mortified vanity no insulting looks of superiority from his neighbour
and no sentence of contemptuous banishment is read against him these
all fall on the tempted and not on the tempter who is permitted to
go free The chief thing that a man learns after having successfully
practised on a woman is to despise the poor wretch whom he has won
The game in fact and the glory such as it is is all his and the
punishment alone falls upon her Consider this ladies when charming
young gentlemen come to woo you with soft speeches You have nothing to
win except wretchedness and scorn and desertion Consider this and
be thankful to your Solomons for telling it

It came to pass then that the Count had come to have a perfect
contempt and indifference for Mrs Hallhow should he not for a young
person who had given herself up to him so easilyand would have been
quite glad of any opportunity of parting with her But there was a
certain lingering shame about the man which prevented him from saying
at once and abruptly Go and the poor thing did not choose to take
such hints as fell out in the course of their conversation and quarrels
And so they kept on together he treating her with simple insult and
she hanging on desperately by whatever feeble twig she could find to
the rock beyond which all was naught or death to her

Well after the night with Tom Trippet and the pretty fellows at the
Rose to which we have heard the Count allude in the conversation
just recorded Fortune smiled on him a good deal for the Warwickshire
squire who had lost forty pieces on that occasion insisted on having
his revenge the night after when strange to say a hundred and fifty
more found their way into the pouch of his Excellency the Count Such a
sum as this quite set the young nobleman afloat again and brought back
a pleasing equanimity to his mind which had been a good deal disturbed
in the former difficult circumstances and in this for a little and to
a certain extent poor Cat had the happiness to share He did not alter
the style of his establishment which consisted as before of herself
and a small person who acted as scourer kitchenwench and scullion
Mrs Catherine always putting her hand to the principal pieces of the
dinner but he treated his mistress with tolerable goodhumour or to
speak more correctly with such bearable brutality as might be expected
from a man like him to a woman in her condition Besides a certain
event was about to take place which not unusually occurs in
circumstances of this nature and Mrs Catherine was expecting soon to
lie in

The Captain distrusting naturally the strength of his own paternal
feelings had kindly endeavoured to provide a parent for the coming
infant and to this end had opened a negotiation with our friend Mr
Thomas Bullock declaring that Mrs Cat should have a fortune of twenty
guineas and reminding Tummas of his ancient flame for her but Mr
Tummas when this proposition was made to him declined it with many
oaths and vowed that he was perfectly satisfied with his present
bachelor condition In this dilemma Mr Brock stepped forward who
declared himself very ready to accept Mrs Catherine and her fortune
and might possibly have become the possessor of both had not Mrs Cat
the moment she heard of the proposed arrangement with fire in her eyes
and rageoh how bitterin her heart prevented the success of the
measure by proceeding incontinently to the first justice of the peace
and there swearing before his worship who was the father of the coming
child

This proceeding which she had expected would cause not a little
indignation on the part of her lord and master was received by him
strangely enough with considerable goodhumour he swore that the wench
had served him a good trick and was rather amused at the anger the
outbreak of fierce rage and contumely and the wretched wretched tears
of heartsick desperation which followed her announcement of this step
to him For Mr Brock she repelled his offer with scorn and loathing
and treated the notion of a union with Mr Bullock with yet fiercer
contempt Marry him indeed a workhouse pauper carrying a brownbess
She would have died sooner she said or robbed on the highway And so
to do her justice she would for the little minx was one of the vainest
creatures in existence and vanity as I presume everybody knows
becomes THE principle in certain womens heartstheir moral spectacles
their conscience their meat and drink their only rule of right and
wrong

As for Mr Tummas he as we have seen was quite unfriendly to the
proposition as she could be and the Corporal with a good deal of
comical gravity vowed that as he could not be satisfied in his
dearest wishes he would take to drinking for a consolation which he
straightway did

Come Tummas said he to Mr Bullock since we CANT have the girl
of our hearts why hang it Tummas lets drink her health To which
Bullock had no objection And so strongly did the disappointment weigh
upon honest Corporal Brock that even when after unheardof quantities
of beer he could scarcely utter a word he was seen absolutely to weep
and in accents almost unintelligible to curse his confounded illluck
at being deprived not of a wife but of a child he wanted one so he
said to comfort him in his old age

The time of Mrs Catherines couche drew near arrived and was gone
through safely She presented to the world a chopping boy who might
use if he liked the Galgenstein arms with a barsinister and in
her new cares and duties had not so many opportunities as usual of
quarrelling with the Count who perhaps respected her situation or
at least was so properly aware of the necessity of quiet to her that
he absented himself from home morning noon and night

The Captain had it must be confessed turned these continued absences
to a considerable worldly profit for he played incessantly and since
his first victory over the Warwickshire Squire Fortune had been so
favourable to him that he had at various intervals amassed a sum of
nearly a thousand pounds which he used to bring home as he won and
which he deposited in a strong iron chest cunningly screwed down by
himself under his own bed This Mrs Catherine regularly made and the
treasure underneath it could be no secret to her However the noble
Count kept the key and bound her by many solemn oaths that he
discharged at her himself not to reveal to any other person the
existence of the chest and its contents

But it is not in a womans nature to keep such secrets and the Captain
who left her for days and days did not reflect that she would seek for
confidants elsewhere For want of a female companion she was compelled
to bestow her sympathies upon Mr Brock who as the Counts
corporal was much in his lodgings and who did manage to survive the
disappointment which he had experienced by Mrs Catherines refusal of
him

About two months after the infants birth the Captain who was annoyed
by its squalling put it abroad to nurse and dismissed its attendant
Mrs Catherine now resumed her household duties and was as before
at once mistress and servant of the establishment As such she had the
keys of the beer and was pretty sure of the attentions of the Corporal
who became as we have said in the Counts absence his ladys chief
friend and companion After the manner of ladies she very speedily
confided to him all her domestic secrets the causes of her former
discontent the Counts illtreatment of her the wicked names he called
her the prices that all her gowns had cost her how he beat her how
much money he won and lost at play how she had once pawned a coat for
him how he had four new ones laced and paid for what was the best
way of cleaning and keeping goldlace of making cherrybrandy pickling
salmon etc etc Her confidences upon all these subjects used to
follow each other in rapid succession and Mr Brock became ere long
quite as well acquainted with the Captains history for the last year as
the Count himselffor he was careless and forgot things women
never do They chronicle all the lovers small actions his words his
headaches the dresses he has worn the things he has liked for dinner
on certain daysall which circumstances commonly are expunged from the
male brain immediately after they have occurred but remain fixed with
the female

To Brock then and to Brock only for she knew no other soul Mrs Cat
breathed in strictest confidence the history of the Counts winnings
and his way of disposing of them how he kept his money screwed down in
an iron chest in their room and a very lucky fellow did Brock consider
his officer for having such a large sum He and Cat looked at the chest
it was small but mighty strong sure enough and would defy picklocks
and thieves Well if any man deserved money the Captain did though
he might buy me a few yards of that lace I love so interrupted
Catif any man deserved money he did for he spent it like a prince
and his hand was always in his pocket

It must now be stated that Monsieur de Galgenstein had during Cats
seclusion cast his eyes upon a young lady of good fortune who
frequented the Assembly at Birmingham and who was not a little smitten
by his title and person The four new coats laced and paid for as
Cat said had been purchased most probably by his Excellency for the
purpose of dazzling the heiress and he and the coats had succeeded so
far as to win from the young woman an actual profession of love and a
promise of marriage provided Pa would consent This was obtainedfor
Pa was a tradesman and I suppose every one of my readers has remarked
how great an effect a title has on the lower classes Yes thank Heaven
there is about a freeborn Briton a cringing baseness and lickspittle
awe of rank which does not exist under any tyranny in Europe and is
only to be found here and in America

All these negotiations had been going on quite unknown to Cat and as
the Captain had determined before two months were out to fling that
young woman on the pave he was kind to her in the meanwhile people
always are when they are swindling you or meditating an injury against
you

The poor girl had much too high an opinion of her own charms to suspect
that the Count could be unfaithful to them and had no notion of the
plot that was formed against her But Mr Brock had for he had seen
many times a gilt coach with a pair of fat white horses ambling in
the neighbourhood of the town and the Captain on his black steed
caracolling majestically by its side and he had remarked a fat pudgy
palehaired woman treading heavily down the stairs of the Assembly
leaning on the Captains arm all these Mr Brock had seen not without
reflection Indeed the Count one day in great goodhumour had slapped
him on the shoulder and told him that he was about speedily to purchase
a regiment when by his great gods Mr Brock should have a pair of
colours Perhaps this promise occasioned his silence to Mrs Catherine
hitherto perhaps he never would have peached at all and perhaps
therefore this history would never have been written but for a small
circumstance which occurred at this period

What can you want with that drunken old Corporal always about your
quarters said Mr Trippet to the Count one day as they sat over their
wine in the midst of a merry company at the Captains rooms

What said he Old Brock The old thief has been more useful to me
than many a better man He is as brave in a row as a lion as cunning in
intrigue as a fox he can nose a dun at an inconceivable distance and
scent out a pretty woman be she behind ever so many stone walls If a
gentleman wants a good rascal now I can recommend him I am going to
reform you know and must turn him out of my service

And pretty Mrs Cat

Oh curse pretty Mrs Cat she may go too

And the brat

Why you have parishes and what not here in England Egad if a
gentleman were called upon to keep all his children there would be no
living no stap my vitals Croesus couldnt stand it

No indeed said Mr Trippet you are right and when a gentleman
marries he is bound in honour to give up such low connections as are
useful when he is a bachelor

Of course and give them up I will when the sweet Mrs Dripping is
mine As for the girl you can have her Tom Trippet if you take a
fancy to her and as for the Corporal he may be handed over to my
successor in Cuttssfor I will have a regiment to myself thats poz
and to take with me such a swindling pimping thieving brandyfaced
rascal as this Brock will never do Egad hes a disgrace to the
service As it is Ive often a mind to have the superannuated vagabond
drummed out of the corps

Although this resume of Mr Brocks character and accomplishments
was very just it came perhaps with an ill grace from Count Gustavus
Adolphus Maximilian who had profited by all his qualities and who
certainly would never have given this opinion of them had he known that
the door of his diningparlour was open and that the gallant Corporal
who was in the passage could hear every syllable that fell from the
lips of his commanding officer We shall not say after the fashion
of the storybooks that Mr Brock listened with a flashing eye and a
distended nostril that his chest heaved tumultuously and that his
hand fell down mechanically to his side where it played with the brass
handle of his sword Mr Kean would have gone through most of these
bodily exercises had he been acting the part of a villain enraged and
disappointed like Corporal Brock but that gentleman walked away without
any gestures of any kind and as gently as possible Hell turn me out
of the regiment will he says he quite piano and then added con
molta espressione Ill do for him

And it is to be remarked how generally in cases of this nature
gentlemen stick to their word



CHAPTER III IN WHICH A NARCOTIC IS ADMINISTERED AND A GREAT DEAL OF
GENTEEL SOCIETY DEPICTED


When the Corporal who had retreated to the streetdoor immediately on
hearing the above conversation returned to the Captains lodgings
and paid his respects to Mrs Catherine he found that lady in high
goodhumour The Count had been with her she said along with a friend
of his Mr Trippet had promised her twelve yards of the lace she
coveted so much had vowed that the child should have as much more for
a cloak and had not left her until he had sat with her for an hour
or more over a bowl of punch which he made on purpose for her Mr
Trippet stayed too A mighty pleasant man said she only not very
wise and seemingly a good deal in liquor

A good deal indeed said the Corporal He was so tipsy just now that
he could hardly stand He and his honour were talking to Nan Fantail in
the marketplace and she pulled Trippets wig off for wanting to kiss
her

The nasty fellow said Mrs Cat to demean himself with such low
people as Nan Fantail indeed Why upon my conscience now Corporal it
was but an hour ago that Mr Trippet swore he never saw such a pair of
eyes as mine and would like to cut the Captains throat for the love of
me Nan Fantail indeed

Nans an honest girl Madam Catherine and was a great favourite of
the Captains before someone else came in his way No one can say a word
against hernot a word

And pray Corporal who ever did said Mrs Cat rather offended A
nasty ugly slut I wonder what the men can see in her

She has got a smart way with her sure enough its what amuses the
men and

And what You dont mean to say that my Max is fond of her NOW said
Mrs Catherine looking very fierce

Oh no not at all not of HERthat is

Not of HER screamed she Of whom then

Oh psha nonsense Of you my dear to be sure who else should he
care for And besides what business is it of mine And herewith
the Corporal began whistling as if he would have no more of the
conversation But Mrs Cat was not to be satisfiednot sheand
carried on her crossquestions

Why look you said the Corporal after parrying many of theseWhy
look you Im an old fool Catherine and I must blab That man has been
the best friend I ever had and so I was quiet but I cant keep it in
any longerno hang me if I can Its my belief hes acting like a
rascal by you he deceives you Catherine hes a scoundrel Mrs Hall
thats the truth ont

Catherine prayed him to tell all he knew and he resumed

He wants you off his hands hes sick of you and so brought here that
fool Tom Trippet who has taken a fancy to you He has not the courage
to turn you out of doors like a man though indoors he can treat you
like a beast But Ill tell you what hell do In a month he will go to
Coventry or pretend to go there on recruiting business No such thing
Mrs Hall hes going on MARRIAGE business and hell leave you without
a farthing to starve or to rot for him Its all arranged I tell you
in a month you are to be starved into becoming Tom Trippets
mistress and his honour is to marry rich Miss Dripping the
twentythousandpounder from London and to purchase a regimentand to
get old Brock drummed out of Cuttss too said the Corporal under his
breath But he might have spoken out if he chose for the poor young
woman had sunk on the ground in a real honest fit

I thought I should give it her said Mr Brock as he procured a glass
of water and lifting her on to a sofa sprinkled the same over her
Hang it how pretty she is

 

When Mrs Catherine came to herself again Brocks tone with her was
kind and almost feeling Nor did the poor wench herself indulge in
any subsequent shiverings and hysterics such as usually follow the
faintingfits of persons of higher degree She pressed him for further
explanations which he gave and to which she listened with a great deal
of calmness nor did many tears sobs sighs or exclamations of sorrow
or anger escape from her only when the Corporal was taking his leave
and said to her pointblankWell Mrs Catherine and what do you
intend to do she did not reply a word but gave a look which made him
exclaim on leaving the room

By heavens the woman means murder I would not be the Holofernes to
lie by the side of such a Judith as thatnot I And he went his way
immersed in deep thought When the Captain returned at night she did
not speak to him and when he swore at her for being sulky she only
said she had a headache and was dreadfully ill with which excuse
Gustavus Adolphus seemed satisfied and left her to herself

He saw her the next morning for a moment he was going ashooting

Catherine had no friend as is usual in tragedies and romancesno
mysterious sorceress of her acquaintance to whom she could apply for
poisonso she went simply to the apothecaries pretending at each that
she had a dreadful toothache and procuring from them as much laudanum
as she thought would suit her purpose

When she went home again she seemed almost gay Mr Brock complimented
her upon the alteration in her appearance and she was enabled to
receive the Captain at his return from shooting in such a manner as made
him remark that she had got rid of her sulks of the morning and might
sup with them if she chose to keep her goodhumour The supper was
got ready and the gentlemen had the punchbowl when the cloth was
clearedMrs Catherine with her delicate hands preparing the liquor

It is useless to describe the conversation that took place or to reckon
the number of bowls that were emptied or to tell how Mr Trippet who
was one of the guests and declined to play at cards when some of the
others began chose to remain by Mrs Catherines side and make violent
love to her All this might be told and the account however faithful
would not be very pleasing No indeed And here though we are only in
the third chapter of this history we feel almost sick of the characters
that appear in it and the adventures which they are called upon to go
through But how can we help ourselves The public will hear of nothing
but rogues and the only way in which poor authors who must live can
act honestly by the public and themselves is to paint such thieves as
they are not dandy poetical rosewater thieves but real downright
scoundrels leading scoundrelly lives drunken profligate dissolute
low as scoundrels will be They dont quote Plato like Eugene Aram or
live like gentlemen and sing the pleasantest ballads in the world like
jolly Dick Turpin or prate eternally about to kalon like that
precious canting Maltravers whom we all of us have read about and
pitied or die whitewashed saints like poor Biss Dadsy in Oliver
Twist No my dear madam you and your daughters have no right to
admire and sympathise with any such persons fictitious or real
you ought to be made cordially to detest scorn loathe abhor and
abominate all people of this kidney Men of genius like those whose
works we have above alluded to have no business to make these
characters interesting or agreeable to be feeding your morbid fancies
or indulging their own with such monstrous food For our parts young
ladies we beg you to bottle up your tears and not waste a single drop
of them on any one of the heroes or heroines in this history they
are all rascals every soul of them and behave as sich Keep your
sympathy for those who deserve it dont carry it for preference to
the Old Bailey and grow maudlin over the company assembled there

  Anglicised version of the authors original Greek text

Just then have the kindness to fancy that the conversation which took
place over the bowls of punch which Mrs Catherine prepared was such
as might be expected to take place where the host was a dissolute
daredevil libertine captain of dragoons the guests for the most
part of the same class and the hostess a young woman originally from a
country alehouse and for the present mistress to the entertainer of
the society They talked and they drank and they grew tipsy and very
little worth hearing occurred during the course of the whole evening
Mr Brock officiated half as the servant half as the companion of the
society Mr Thomas Trippet made violent love to Mrs Catherine while
her lord and master was playing at dice with the other gentlemen and on
this night strange to say the Captains fortune seemed to desert him
The Warwickshire Squire from whom he had won so much had an amazing
run of good luck The Captain called perpetually for more drink and
higher stakes and lost almost every throw Three hundred four hundred
six hundredall his winnings of the previous months were swallowed up
in the course of a few hours The Corporal looked on and to do him
justice seemed very grave as sum by sum the Squire scored down the
Counts losses on the paper before him

Most of the company had taken their hats and staggered off The Squire
and Mr Trippet were the only two that remained the latter still
lingering by Mrs Catherines sofa and table and as she as we have
stated had been employed all the evening in mixing the liquor for
the gamesters he was at the headquarters of love and drink and had
swallowed so much of each as hardly to be able to speak

The dice went rattling on the candles were burning dim with great long
wicks Mr Trippet could hardly see the Captain and thought as far as
his muzzy reason would let him that the Captain could not see him
so he rose from his chair as well as he could and fell down on Mrs
Catherines sofa His eyes were fixed his face was pale his jaw hung
down and he flung out his arms and said in a maudlin voice Oh you
byooooootifile Cathrine I must have a kickkickiss

Beast said Mrs Catherine and pushed him away The drunken wretch
fell off the sofa and on to the floor where he stayed and after
snorting out some unintelligible sounds went to sleep

The dice went rattling on the candles were burning dim with great long
wicks

Sevens the main cried the Count Four Three to two against the
caster

Ponies said the Warwickshire Squire

Rattle rattle rattle rattle clatter NINE Clap clap clap clap
ELEVEN Clutter clutter clutter clutter Seven it is says the
Warwickshire Squire That makes eight hundred Count

One throw for two hundred said the Count But stop Cat give us
some more punch

Mrs Cat came forward she looked a little pale and her hand trembled
somewhat Here is the punch Max said she It was steaming hot in a
large glass Dont drink it all said she leave me some

How dark it is said the Count eyeing it

Its the brandy said Cat

Well here goes Squire curse you heres your health and bad luck
to you and he gulped off more than half the liquor at a draught But
presently he put down the glass and cried What infernal poison is
this Cat

Poison said she Its no poison Give me the glass And she pledged
Max and drank a little of it Tis good punch Max and of my brewing
I dont think you will ever get any better And she went back to the
sofa again and sat down and looked at the players

Mr Brock looked at her white face and fixed eyes with a grim kind of
curiosity The Count sputtered and cursed the horrid taste of the punch
still but he presently took the box and made his threatened throw

As before the Squire beat him and having booked his winnings rose
from table as well as he might and besought to lead him downstairs
which Mr Brock did

Liquor had evidently stupefied the Count he sat with his head between
his hands muttering wildly about illluck sevens the main bad punch
and so on The streetdoor banged to and the steps of Brock and the
Squire were heard until they could be heard no more

Max said she but he did not answer Max said she again laying
her hand on his shoulder

Curse you said that gentleman keep off and dont be laying your
paws upon me Go to bed you jade or to  for what I care and give me
first some more puncha gallon more punch do you hear

The gentleman by the curses at the commencement of this little speech
and the request contained at the end of it showed that his losses vexed
him and that he was anxious to forget them temporarily

Oh Max whimpered Mrs Cat youdontwant any more punch

Dont Shant I be drunk in my own house you cursed whimpering jade
you Get out and with this the Captain proceeded to administer a blow
upon Mrs Catherines cheek

Contrary to her custom she did not avenge it or seek to do so as
on the many former occasions when disputes of this nature had arisen
between the Count and her but now Mrs Catherine fell on her knees and
clasping her hands and looking pitifully in the Counts face cried
Oh Count forgive me forgive me

Forgive you What for Because I slapped your face Ha ha Ill
forgive you again if you dont mind

Oh no no no said she wringing her hands It isnt that Max
dear Max will you forgive me It isnt the blowI dont mind that
its

Its what youmaudlin fool

ITS THE PUNCH

The Count who was more than half seas over here assumed an air of much
tipsy gravity The punch No I never will forgive you that last glass
of punch Of all the foul beastly drinks I ever tasted that was the
worst No I never will forgive you that punch

Oh it isnt that it isnt that said she

I tell you it is thatyou That punch I say that punch was no better
than pawawoison And here the Counts head sank back and he fell to
snore

IT WAS POISON said she

WHAT screamed he waking up at once and spurning her away from him
What you infernal murderess have you killed me

Oh Maxdont kill me Max It was laudanumindeed it was You were
going to be married and I was furious and I went and got

Hold your tongue you fiend roared out the Count and with more
presence of mind than politeness he flung the remainder of the liquor
and indeed the glass with it at the head of Mrs Catherine But the
poisoned chalice missed its mark and fell right on the nose of Mr Tom
Trippet who was left asleep and unobserved under the table

Bleeding staggering swearing indeed a ghastly sight up sprang Mr
Trippet and drew his rapier Come on says he never say die Whats
the row Im ready for a dozen of you And he made many blind and
furious passes about the room

Curse you well die together shouted the Count as he too pulled out
his toledo and sprang at Mrs Catherine

Help murder thieves shrieked she Save me Mr Trippet save me
and she placed that gentleman between herself and the Count and then
made for the door of the bedroom and gained it and bolted it

Out of the way Trippet roared the Countout of the way you
drunken beast Ill murder her I willIll have the devils life And
here he gave a swinging cut at Mr Trippets sword it sent the weapon
whirling clean out of his hand and through a window into the street

Take my life then said Mr Trippet Im drunk but Im a man and
damme will never say die

I dont want your life you stupid fool Hark you Trippet wake and
be sober if you can That woman has heard of my marriage with Miss
Dripping

Twenty thousand pound ejaculated Trippet

She has been jealous I tell you and POISONED us She has put laudanum
into the punch

What in MY punch said Trippet growing quite sober and losing his
courage O Lord O Lord

Dont stand howling there but run for a doctor tis our only chance
And away ran Mr Trippet as if the deuce were at his heels

The Count had forgotten his murderous intentions regarding his mistress
or had deferred them at least under the consciousness of his own
pressing danger And it must be said in the praise of a man who had
fought for and against Marlborough and Tallard that his courage in this
trying and novel predicament never for a moment deserted him but that
he showed the greatest daring as well as ingenuity in meeting and
averting the danger He flew to the sideboard where were the relics of
a supper and seizing the mustard and salt pots and a bottle of oil
he emptied them all into a jug into which he further poured a vast
quantity of hot water This pleasing mixture he then without a moments
hesitation placed to his lips and swallowed as much of it as nature
would allow him But when he had imbibed about a quart the anticipated
effect was produced and he was enabled by the power of this ingenious
extemporaneous emetic to get rid of much of the poison which Mrs
Catherine had administered to him

He was employed in these efforts when the doctor entered along with
Mr Brock and Mr Trippet who was not a little pleased to hear that
the poisoned punch had not in all probability been given to him He
was recommended to take some of the Counts mixture as a precautionary
measure but this he refused and retired home leaving the Count under
charge of the physician and his faithful corporal

It is not necessary to say what further remedies were employed by
them to restore the Captain to health but after some time the doctor
pronouncing that the danger was he hoped averted recommended that his
patient should be put to bed and that somebody should sit by him which
Brock promised to do

That shedevil will murder me if you dont gasped the poor Count
You must turn her out of the bedroom or break open the door if she
refuses to let you in

And this step was found to be necessary for after shouting many
times and in vain Mr Brock found a small iron bar indeed he had the
instrument for many days in his pocket and forced the lock The room
was empty the window was open the pretty barmaid of the Bugle had
fled

The chest said the Countis the chest safe

The Corporal flew to the bed under which it was screwed and looked
and said It IS safe thank Heaven The window was closed The
Captain who was too weak to stand without help was undressed and put
to bed The Corporal sat down by his side slumber stole over the eyes
of the patient and his wakeful nurse marked with satisfaction the
progress of the beneficent restorer of health

When the Captain awoke as he did some time afterwards he found very
much to his surprise that a gag had been placed in his mouth and that
the Corporal was in the act of wheeling his bed to another part of the
room He attempted to move and gave utterance to such unintelligible
sounds as could issue through a silk handkerchief

If your honour stirs or cries out in the least I will cut your
honours throat said the Corporal

And then having recourse to his iron bar the reader will now see why
he was provided with such an implement for he had been meditating this
coup for some days he proceeded first to attempt to burst the lock of
the little iron chest in which the Count kept his treasure and failing
in this to unscrew it from the ground which operation he performed
satisfactorily

You see Count said he calmly when rogues fall out theres the
deuce to pay Youll have me drummed out of the regiment will you
Im going to leave it of my own accord look you and to live like a
gentleman for the rest of my days Schlafen Sie wohl noble Captain bon
repos The Squire will be with you pretty early in the morning to ask
for the money you owe him

With these sarcastic observations Mr Brock departed not by the window
as Mrs Catherine had done but by the door quietly and so into
the street And when the next morning the doctor came to visit his
patient he brought with him a story how at the dead of night Mr
Brock had roused the ostler at the stables where the Captains horses
were kepthad told him that Mrs Catherine had poisoned the Count and
had run off with a thousand pounds and how he and all lovers of justice
ought to scour the country in pursuit of the criminal For this end Mr
Brock mounted the Counts best horsethat very animal on which he
had carried away Mrs Catherine and thus on a single night Count
Maximilian had lost his mistress his money his horse his corporal
and was very near losing his life



CHAPTER IV IN WHICH MRS CATHERINE BECOMES AN HONEST WOMAN AGAIN


In this woeful plight moneyless wifeless horseless corporalless
with a gag in his mouth and a rope round his body are we compelled to
leave the gallant Galgenstein until his friends and the progress of
this history shall deliver him from his durance Mr Brocks adventures
on the Captains horse must likewise be pretermitted for it is our
business to follow Mrs Catherine through the window by which she made
her escape and among the various chances that befell her

She had one cause to congratulate herselfthat she had not her baby at
her back for the infant was safely housed under the care of a nurse
to whom the Captain was answerable Beyond this her prospects were but
dismal no home to fly to but a few shillings in her pocket and a
whole heap of injuries and dark revengeful thoughts in her bosom it was
a sad task to her to look either backwards or forwards Whither was she
to fly How to live What good chance was to befriend her There was an
angel watching over the steps of Mrs Catnot a good one I think but
one of those from that unnameable place who have their many subjects
here on earth and often are pleased to extricate them from worse
perplexities

Mrs Cat now had not committed murder but as bad as murder and as
she felt not the smallest repentance in her heartas she had in
the course of her life and connection with the Captain performed and
gloried in a number of wicked coquetries idlenesses vanities lies
fits of anger slanders foul abuses and what notshe was fairly bound
over to this dark angel whom we have alluded to and he dealt with her
and aided her as one of his own children

I do not mean to say that in this strait he appeared to her in the
likeness of a gentleman in black and made her sign her name in blood
to a document conveying over to him her soul in exchange for certain
conditions to be performed by him Such diabolical bargains have always
appeared to me unworthy of the astute personage who is supposed to be
one of the parties to them and who would scarcely be fool enough to pay
dearly for that which he can have in a few years for nothing It is not
then to be supposed that a demon of darkness appeared to Mrs Cat
and led her into a flaming chariot harnessed by dragons and careering
through air at the rate of a thousand leagues a minute No such thing
the vehicle that was sent to aid her was one of a much more vulgar
description

The Liverpool carryvan then which in the year 1706 used to perform
the journey between London and that place in ten days left Birmingham
about an hour after Mrs Catherine had quitted that town and as she sat
weeping on a hillside and plunged in bitter meditation the lumbering
jingling vehicle overtook her The coachman was marching by the side of
his horses and encouraging them to maintain their pace of two miles an
hour the passengers had some of them left the vehicle in order to
walk up the hill and the carriage had arrived at the top of it and
meditating a brisk trot down the declivity waited there until the
lagging passengers should arrive when Jehu casting a goodnatured
glance upon Mrs Catherine asked the pretty maid whence she was come
and whether she would like a ride in his carriage To the latter of
which questions Mrs Catherine replied truly yes to the former her
answer was that she had come from Stratford whereas as we very well
know she had lately quitted Birmingham

Hast thee seen a woman pass this way on a black horse with a large
bag of goold over the saddle said Jehu preparing to mount upon the
roof of his coach

No indeed said Mrs Cat

Nor a trooper on another horse after herno Well there be a mortal
row down Birmingham way about sich a one She have killed they say
nine gentlemen at supper and have strangled a German prince in bed
She have robbed him of twenty thousand guineas and have rode away on a
black horse

That cant be I said Mrs Cat naively for I have but three
shillings and a groat

No it cant be thee truly for wheres your bag of goold and
besides thee hast got too pretty a face to do such wicked things as to
kill nine gentlemen and strangle a German prince

Law coachman said Mrs Cat blushing archly Law coachman DO you
think so The girl would have been pleased with a compliment even on
her way to be hanged and the parley ended by Mrs Catherine stepping
into the carriage where there was room for eight people at least and
where two or three individuals had already taken their places For these
Mrs Catherine had in the first place to make a story which she did
and a very glib one for a person of her years and education Being asked
whither she was bound and how she came to be alone of a morning sitting
by a roadside she invented a neat history suitable to the occasion
which elicited much interest from her fellowpassengers one in
particular a young man who had caught a glimpse of her face under her
hood was very tender in his attentions to her

But whether it was that she had been too much fatigued by the
occurrences of the past day and sleepless night or whether the little
laudanum which she had drunk a few hours previously now began to act
upon her certain it is that Mrs Cat now suddenly grew sick feverish
and extraordinarily sleepy and in this state she continued for
many hours to the pity of all her fellowtravellers At length the
carryvan reached the inn where horses and passengers were accustomed
to rest for a few hours and to dine and Mrs Catherine was somewhat
awakened by the stir of the passengers and the friendly voice of the
innservant welcoming them to dinner The gentleman who had been smitten
by her beauty now urged her very politely to descend which taking the
protection of his arm she accordingly did

He made some very gallant speeches to her as she stepped out and
she must have been very much occupied by them or wrapt up in her own
thoughts or stupefied by sleep fever and opium for she did not take
any heed of the place into which she was going which had she done
she would probably have preferred remaining in the coach dinnerless and
ill Indeed the inn into which she was about to make her entrance was
no other than the Bugle from which she set forth at the commencement
of this history and which then as now was kept by her relative the
thrifty Mrs Score That good landlady seeing a lady in a smart hood
and cloak leaning as if faint upon the arm of a gentleman of good
appearance concluded them to be man and wife and folks of quality too
and with much discrimination as well as sympathy led them through the
public kitchen to her own private parlour or bar where she handed the
lady an armchair and asked what she would like to drink By this time
and indeed at the very moment she heard her aunts voice Mrs Catherine
was aware of her situation and when her companion retired and the
landlady with much officiousness insisted on removing her hood she
was quite prepared for the screech of surprise which Mrs Score gave on
dropping it exclaiming Why law bless us its our Catherine

Im very ill and tired aunt said Cat and would give the world for
a few hours sleep

A few hours and welcome my love and a sackposset too You do look
sadly tired and poorly sure enough Ah Cat Cat you great ladies
are sad rakes I do believe I wager now that with all your balls and
carriages and fine clothes you are neither so happy nor so well as
when you lived with your poor old aunt who used to love you so And
with these gentle words and an embrace or two which Mrs Catherine
wondered at and permitted she was conducted to that very bed which the
Count had occupied a year previously and undressed and laid in it and
affectionately tucked up by her aunt who marvelled at the fineness of
her clothes as she removed them piece by piece and when she saw
that in Mrs Catherines pocket there was only the sum of three and
fourpence said archly There was no need of money for the Captain
took care of that

Mrs Cat did not undeceive her and deceived Mrs Score certainly
wasfor she imagined the welldressed gentleman who led Cat from the
carriage was no other than the Count and as she had heard from time
to time exaggerated reports of the splendour of the establishment which
he kept up she was induced to look upon her niece with the very highest
respect and to treat her as if she were a fine lady And so she IS
a fine lady Mrs Score had said months ago when some of these
flattering stories reached her and she had overcome her first fury at
Catherines elopement The girl was very cruel to leave me but we must
recollect that she is as good as married to a nobleman and must all
forget and forgive you know

This speech had been made to Doctor Dobbs who was in the habit of
taking a pipe and a tankard at the Bugle and it had been roundly
reprobated by the worthy divine who told Mrs Score that the crime
of Catherine was only the more heinous if it had been committed from
interested motives and protested that were she a princess he would
never speak to her again Mrs Score thought and pronounced the Doctors
opinion to be very bigoted indeed she was one of those persons who
have a marvellous respect for prosperity and a corresponding scorn for
illfortune When therefore she returned to the public room she
went graciously to the gentleman who had led Mrs Catherine from the
carriage and with a knowing curtsey welcomed him to the Bugle told
him that his lady would not come to dinner but bade her say with her
best love to his Lordship that the ride had fatigued her and that she
would lie in bed for an hour or two

This speech was received with much wonder by his Lordship who was
indeed no other than a Liverpool tailor going to London to learn
fashions but he only smiled and did not undeceive the landlady who
herself went off smilingly to bustle about dinner

The two or three hours allotted to that meal by the liberal coachmasters
of those days passed away and Mr Coachman declaring that his horses
were now rested enough and that they had twelve miles to ride put the
steeds to and summoned the passengers Mrs Score who had seen with
much satisfaction that her niece was really ill and her fever more
violent and hoped to have her for many days an inmate in her house now
came forward and casting upon the Liverpool tailor a look of profound
but respectful melancholy said My Lord for I recollect your Lordship
quite well the lady upstairs is so ill that it would be a sin to move
her had I not better tell coachman to take down your Lordships trunks
and the ladys and make you a bed in the next room

Very much to her surprise this proposition was received with a roar
of laughter Madam said the person addressed Im not a lord but
a tailor and draper and as for that young woman before today I never
set eyes on her

WHAT screamed out Mrs Score Are not you the Count Do you mean to
say that you ant Cats DO you mean to say that you didnt order her
bed and that you wont pay this here little bill And with this she
produced a document by which the Counts lady was made her debtor in a
sum of halfaguinea

These passionate words excited more and more laughter Pay it my
Lord said the coachman and then come along for time presses Our
respects to her Ladyship said one passenger Tell her my Lord cant
wait said another and with much merriment one and all quitted the
hotel entered the coach and rattled off

Dumbpale with terror and ragebill in hand Mrs Score had followed
the company but when the coach disappeared her senses returned Back
she flew into the inn overturning the ostler not deigning to answer
Doctor Dobbs who from behind soft tobaccofumes mildly asked the
reason of her disturbance and bounding upstairs like a fury she
rushed into the room where Catherine lay

Well madam said she in her highest key do you mean that you have
come into this here house to swindle me Do you dare for to come with
your airs here and call yourself a noblemans lady and sleep in the
best bed when youre no better nor a common tramper Ill thank you
maam to get out maam Ill have no sick paupers in this house
maam You know your way to the workhouse maam and there Ill trouble
you for to go And here Mrs Score proceeded quickly to pull off the
bedclothes and poor Cat arose shivering with fright and fever

She had no spirit to answer as she would have done the day before when
an oath from any human being would have brought halfadozen from her in
return or a knife or a plate or a leg of mutton if such had been to
her hand She had no spirit left for such repartees but in reply to the
above words of Mrs Score and a great many more of the same kindwhich
are not necessary for our history but which that lady uttered with
inconceivable shrillness and volubility the poor wench could say
littleonly sob and shiver and gather up the clothes again crying
Oh aunt dont speak unkind to me Im very unhappy and very ill

Ill you strumpet ill be hanged Ill is as ill does and if you are
ill its only what you merit Get out dress yourselftramp Get to
the workhouse and dont come to cheat me any more Dress yourselfdo
you hear Satin petticoat forsooth and lace to her smock

Poor wretched chattering burning shivering Catherine huddled on her
clothes as well she might she seemed hardly to know or see what she was
doing and did not reply a single word to the many that the landlady let
fall Cat tottered down the narrow stairs and through the kitchen and
to the door which she caught hold of and paused awhile and looked
into Mrs Scores face as for one more chance Get out you nasty
trull said that lady sternly with arms akimbo and poor Catherine
with a most piteous scream and outgush of tears let go of the doorpost
and staggered away into the road

 

Why noyesnoit is poor Catherine Hall as I live said somebody
starting up shoving aside Mrs Score very rudely and running into
the road wig off and pipe in hand It was honest Doctor Dobbs and
the result of his interview with Mrs Cat was that he gave up for ever
smoking his pipe at the Bugle and that she lay sick of a fever for
some weeks in his house

 

Over this part of Mrs Cats history we shall be as brief as possible
for to tell the truth nothing immoral occurred during her whole stay
at the good Doctors house and we are not going to insult the reader
by offering him silly pictures of piety cheerfulness good sense and
simplicity which are milkandwater virtues after all and have no
relish with them like a good strong vice highly peppered Well to be
short Doctor Dobbs though a profound theologian was a very simple
gentleman and before Mrs Cat had been a month in the house he had
learned to look upon her as one of the most injured and repentant
characters in the world and had with Mrs Dobbs resolved many plans
for the future welfare of the young Magdalen She was but sixteen my
love recollect said the Doctor she was carried off not by her own
wish either The Count swore he would marry her and though she did not
leave him until that monster tried to poison her yet think what a
fine Christian spirit the poor girl has shown she forgives him as
heartilymore heartily I am sure than I do Mrs Score for turning her
adrift in that wicked way The reader will perceive some difference in
the Doctors statement and ours which we assure him is the true one
but the fact is the honest rector had had his tale from Mrs Cat and
it was not in his nature to doubt if she had told him a history ten
times more wonderful

The reverend gentleman and his wife then laid their heads together and
recollecting something of John Hayess former attachment to Mrs Cat
thought that it might be advantageously renewed should Hayes be still
constant Having very adroitly sounded Catherine so adroitly indeed
as to ask her whether she would like to marry John Hayes that young
woman had replied No She had loved John Hayeshe had been her early
only love but she was fallen now and not good enough for him And
this made the Dobbs family admire her more and more and cast about for
means to bring the marriage to pass

Hayes was away from the village when Mrs Cat had arrived there but he
did not fail to hear of her illness and how her aunt had deserted her
and the good Doctor taken her in The worthy Doctor himself met Mr
Hayes on the green and telling him that some repairs were wanting in
his kitchen begged him to step in and examine them Hayes first said no
plump and then no gently and then pished and then pshad and then
trembling very much went in and there sat Mrs Catherine trembling
very much too

What passed between them If your Ladyship is anxious to know think of
that morning when Sir John himself popped the question Could there be
anything more stupid than the conversation which took place Such stuff
is not worth repeating no not when uttered by people in the very
genteelest of company as for the amorous dialogue of a carpenter and
an exbarmaid it is worse still Suffice it to say that Mr Hayes who
had had a year to recover from his passion and had to all appearances
quelled it was over head and ears again the very moment he saw Mrs
Cat and had all his work to do again

Whether the Doctor knew what was going on I cant say but this matter
is certain that every evening Hayes was now in the rectory kitchen or
else walking abroad with Mrs Catherine and whether she ran away with
him or he with her I shall not make it my business to inquire but
certainly at the end of three months which must be crowded up into this
one little sentence another elopement took place in the village I
should have prevented it certainly said Doctor Dobbswhereat his
wife smiled but the young people kept the matter a secret from me
And so he would had he known it but though Mrs Dobbs had made
several attempts to acquaint him with the precise hour and method of the
intended elopement he peremptorily ordered her to hold her tongue The
fact is that the matter had been discussed by the rectors lady many
times Young Hayes would she say has a pretty little fortune and
trade of his own he is an only son and may marry as he likes and
though not specially handsome generous or amiable has an undeniable
love for Cat who you know must not be particular and the sooner she
marries him I think the better They cant be married at our
church you know and Well said the Doctor if they are married
elsewhere I cant help it and know nothing about it look you And
upon this hint the elopement took place which indeed was peaceably
performed early one Sunday morning about a month after Mrs Hall
getting behind Mr Hayes on a pillion and all the children of the
parsonage giggling behind the windowblinds to see the pair go off

During this month Mr Hayes had caused the banns to be published at the
town of Worcester judging rightly that in a great town they would cause
no such remark as in a solitary village and thither he conducted his
lady O illstarred John Hayes whither do the dark Fates lead you O
foolish Doctor Dobbs to forget that young people ought to honour their
parents and to yield to silly Mrs Dobbss ardent propensity for making
matches

 

The London Gazette of the 1st April 1706 contains a proclamation
by the Queen for putting into execution an Act of Parliament for the
encouragement and increase of seamen and for the better and speedier
manning of Her Majestys fleet which authorises all justices to issue
warrants to constables petty constables headboroughs and tythingmen
to enter and if need be to break open the doors of any houses where
they shall believe deserting seamen to be and for the further increase
and encouragement of the navy to take ablebodied landsmen when seamen
fail This Act which occupies four columns of the Gazette and another
of similar length and meaning for pressing men into the army need
not be quoted at length here but caused a mighty stir throughout the
kingdom at the time when it was in force

As one has seen or heard after the march of a great army a number of
rogues and loose characters bring up the rear in like manner at
the tail of a great measure of State follow many roguish personal
interests which are protected by the main body The great measure of
Reform for instance carried along with it much private jobbing and
swindlingas could be shown were we not inclined to deal mildly with
the Whigs and this Enlistment Act which in order to maintain the
British glories in Flanders dealt most cruelly with the British people
in England it is not the first time that a man has been pinched at home
to make a fine appearance abroad created a great company of rascals
and informers throughout the land who lived upon it or upon extortion
from those who were subject to it or not being subject to it were
frightened into the belief that they were

When Mr Hayes and his lady had gone through the marriage ceremony at
Worcester the former concluding that at such a place lodging and food
might be procured at a cheaper rate looked about carefully for the
meanest publichouse in the town where he might deposit his bride

In the kitchen of this inn a party of men were drinking and as
Mrs Hayes declined with a proper sense of her superiority to eat in
company with such low fellows the landlady showed her and her husband
to an inner apartment where they might be served in private

The kitchen party seemed indeed not such as a lady would choose to
join There was one huge lanky fellow that looked like a soldier
and had a halberd another was habited in a sailors costume with a
fascinating patch over one eye and a third who seemed the leader
of the gang was a stout man in a sailors frock and a horsemans
jackboots whom one might fancy if he were anything to be a
horsemarine

Of one of these worthies Mrs Hayes thought she knew the figure and
voice and she found her conjectures were true when all of sudden
three people without With your leave or By your leave burst into
the room into which she and her spouse had retired At their head was
no other than her old friend Mr Peter Brock he had his sword drawn
and his finger to his lips enjoining silence as it were to Mrs
Catherine He with the patch on his eye seized incontinently on Mr
Hayes the tall man with the halberd kept the door two or three heroes
supported the oneeyed man who with a loud voice exclaimed Down
with your armsno resistance you are my prisoner in the Queens
name

And here at this lock we shall leave the whole company until the next
chapter which may possibly explain what they were



CHAPTER V CONTAINS MR BROCKS AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND OTHER MATTERS


You dont sure believe these men said Mrs Hayes as soon as the
first alarm caused by the irruption of Mr Brock and his companions had
subsided These are no magistrates men it is but a trick to rob you
of your money John

I will never give up a farthing of it screamed Hayes

Yonder fellow continued Mrs Catherine I know for all his drawn
sword and fierce looks his name is

Wood madam at your service said Mr Brock I am follower to Mr
Justice Gobble of this town ant I Tim said Mr Brock to the tall
halberdman who was keeping the door

Yes indeed said Tim archly were all followers of his honour
Justice Gobble

Certainly said the oneeyed man

Of course cried the man in the nightcap

I suppose madam youre satisfied NOW continued Mr Brock alias
Wood You cant deny the testimony of gentlemen like these and our
commission is to apprehend all ablebodied male persons who can give
no good account of themselves and enrol them in the service of Her
Majesty Look at this Mr Hayes who stood trembling in his shoes
Can there be a bolder properer straighter gentleman Well have him
for a grenadier before the days over

Take heart Johndont be frightened Psha I tell you I know the man
cried out Mrs Hayes he is only here to extort money

Oh for that matter I DO think I recollect the lady Let me see where
was it At Birmingham I thinkay at Birminghamabout the time when
they tried to murder Count Gal

Oh sir here cried Madam Hayes dropping her voice at once from a
tone of scorn to one of gentlest entreaty what is it you want with my
husband I know not indeed if ever I saw you before For what do you
seize him How much will you take to release him and let us go Name
the sum he is rich and

RICH Catherine cried Hayes RichO heavens Sir I have nothing
but my hands to support me I am a poor carpenter sir working under my
father

He can give twenty guineas to be free I know he can said Mrs Cat

I have but a guinea to carry me home sighed out Hayes

But you have twenty at home John said his wife Give these brave
gentlemen a writing to your mother and she will pay and you will let
us free then gentlemenwont you

When the moneys paid yes said the leader Mr Brock

Oh in course echoed the tall man with the halberd Whats a
thrifling detintion my dear continued he addressing Hayes Well
amuse you in your absence and drink to the health of your pretty wife
here

This promise to do the halberdier justice he fulfilled He called upon
the landlady to produce the desired liquor and when Mr Hayes flung
himself at that ladys feet demanding succour from her and asking
whether there was no law in the land

Theres no law at the Three Rooks except THIS said Mr Brock
in reply holding up a horsepistol To which the hostess grinning
assented and silently went her way

After some further solicitations John Hayes drew out the necessary
letter to his father stating that he was pressed and would not be set
free under a sum of twenty guineas and that it would be of no use
to detain the bearer of the letter inasmuch as the gentlemen who had
possession of him vowed that they would murder him should any harm
befall their comrade As a further proof of the authenticity of the
letter a token was added a ring that Hayes wore and that his mother
had given him

The missives were after some consultation entrusted to the care of the
tall halberdier who seemed to rank as second in command of the
forces that marched under Corporal Brock This gentleman was called
indifferently Ensign Mr or even Captain Macshane his intimates
occasionally in sport called him Nosey from the prominence of that
feature in his countenance or Spindleshins for the very reason which
brought on the first Edward a similar nickname Mr Macshane then
quitted Worcester mounted on Hayess horse leaving all parties at the
Three Rooks not a little anxious for his return

This was not to be expected until the next morning and a weary nuit de
noces did Mr Hayes pass Dinner was served and according to promise
Mr Brock and his two friends enjoyed the meal along with the bride and
bridegroom Punch followed and this was taken in company then came
supper Mr Brock alone partook of this the other two gentlemen
preferring the society of their pipes and the landlady in the kitchen

It is a sorry entertainment I confess said the excorporal and a
dismal way for a gentleman to spend his bridal night but somebody must
stay with you my dears for who knows but you might take a fancy to
scream out of window and then there would be murder and the deuce and
all to pay One of us must stay and my friends love a pipe so you must
put up with my company until they can relieve guard

The reader will not of course expect that three people who were to
pass the night however unwillingly together in an innroom should
sit there dumb and moody and without any personal communication on the
contrary Mr Brock as an old soldier entertained his prisoners with
the utmost courtesy and did all that lay in his power by the help
of liquor and conversation to render their durance tolerable On
the bridegroom his attentions were a good deal thrown away Mr Hayes
consented to drink copiously but could not be made to talk much and
in fact the fright of the seizure the fate hanging over him should his
parents refuse a ransom and the tremendous outlay of money which would
take place should they accede to it weighed altogether on his mind so
much as utterly to unman it

As for Mrs Cat I dont think she was at all sorry in her heart to see
the old Corporal for he had been a friend of old timesdear times to
her she had had from him too and felt for him not a little kindness
and there was really a very tender innocent friendship subsisting
between this pair of rascals who relished much a nights conversation
together

The Corporal after treating his prisoners to punch in great quantities
proposed the amusement of cards over which Mr Hayes had not been
occupied more than an hour when he found himself so excessively sleepy
as to be persuaded to fling himself down on the bed dressed as he was
and there to snore away until morning

Mrs Catherine had no inclination for sleep and the Corporal equally
wakeful plied incessantly the bottle and held with her a great deal
of conversation The sleep which was equivalent to the absence of John
Hayes took all restraint from their talk She explained to Brock the
circumstances of her marriage which we have already described they
wondered at the chance which had brought them together at the Three
Rooks nor did Brock at all hesitate to tell her at once that his
calling was quite illegal and that his intention was simply to extort
money The worthy Corporal had not the slightest shame regarding his
own profession and cut many jokes with Mrs Cat about her late one her
attempt to murder the Count and her future prospects as a wife

And here having brought him upon the scene again we may as well
shortly narrate some of the principal circumstances which befell him
after his sudden departure from Birmingham and which he narrated with
much candour to Mrs Catherine

He rode the Captains horse to Oxford having exchanged his military
dress for a civil costume on the road and at Oxford he disposed of
George of Denmark a great bargain to one of the heads of colleges
As soon as Mr Brock who took on himself the style and title of Captain
Wood had sufficiently examined the curiosities of the University he
proceeded at once to the capital the only place for a gentleman of his
fortune and figure

Here he read with a great deal of philosophical indifference in the
Daily Post the Courant the Observator the Gazette and the chief
journals of those days which he made a point of examining at Buttons
and Wills an accurate description of his person his clothes and
the horse he rode and a promise of fifty guineas reward to any person
who would give an account of him so that he might be captured to
Captain Count Galgenstein at Birmingham to Mr Murfey at the Golden
Ball in the Savoy or Mr Bates at the Blew Anchor in Pickadilly But
Captain Wood in an enormous fullbottomed periwig that cost him sixty
pounds with high red heels to his shoes a silver sword and a
gold snuffbox and a large wound obtained he said at the siege of
Barcelona which disfigured much of his countenance and caused him to
cover one eye was in small danger he thought of being mistaken for
Corporal Brock the deserter of Cuttss and strutted along the Mall
with as grave an air as the very best nobleman who appeared there
He was generally indeed voted to be very good company and as his
expenses were unlimited A few convent candlesticks my dear he used
to whisper melt into a vast number of doubloons he commanded as
good society as he chose to ask for and it was speedily known as a fact
throughout town that Captain Wood who had served under His Majesty
Charles III of Spain had carried off the diamond petticoat of Our Lady
of Compostella and lived upon the proceeds of the fraud People were
good Protestants in those days and many a one longed to have been his
partner in the pious plunder

  In the ingenious contemporary history of Moll Flanders a
 periwig is mentioned as costing that sum

All surmises concerning his wealth Captain Wood with much discretion
encouraged He contradicted no report but was quite ready to confirm
all and when two different rumours were positively put to him he used
only to laugh and say My dear sir _I_ dont make the stories but
Im not called upon to deny them and I give you fair warning that I
shall assent to every one of them so you may believe them or not as
you please And so he had the reputation of being a gentleman not only
wealthy but discreet In truth it was almost a pity that worthy Brock
had not been a gentleman born in which case doubtless he would have
lived and died as became his station for he spent his money like
a gentleman he loved women like a gentleman he would fight like a
gentleman he gambled and got drunk like a gentleman What did he want
else Only a matter of six descents a little money and an estate to
render him the equal of St John or Harley Ah those were merry days
would Mr Brock sayfor he loved in a good old age to recount the
story of his London fashionable campaignand when I think how near
I was to become a great man and to die perhaps a general I cant but
marvel at the wicked obstinacy of my illluck

I will tell you what I did my dear I had lodgings in Piccadilly as
if I were a lord I had two large periwigs and three suits of laced
clothes I kept a little black dressed out like a Turk I walked daily
in the Mall I dined at the politest ordinary in Covent Garden I
frequented the best of coffeehouses and knew all the pretty fellows of
the town I cracked a bottle with Mr Addison and lent many a piece to
Dick Steele a sad debauched rogue my dear and above all Ill tell
you what I didthe noblest stroke that sure ever a gentleman performed
in my situation

One day going into Wills I saw a crowd of gentlemen gathered
together and heard one of them say Captain Wood I dont know the
man but there was a Captain Wood in Southwells regiment Egad it was
my Lord Peterborough himself who was talking about me So putting off
my hat I made a most gracious conge to my Lord and said I knew HIM
and rode behind him at Barcelona on our entry into that town

No doubt you did Captain Wood says my Lord taking my hand and
no doubt you know me for many more know Tom Fool than Tom Fool knows
And with this at which all of us laughed my Lord called for a bottle
and he and I sat down and drank it together

Well he was in disgrace as you know but he grew mighty fond of me
andwould you believe itnothing would satisfy him but presenting me
at Court Yes to Her Sacred Majesty the Queen and my Lady Marlborough
who was in high feather Ay truly the sentinels on duty used to
salute me as if I were Corporal John himself I was on the high road to
fortune Charley Mordaunt used to call me Jack and drink canary at my
chambers I used to make one at my Lord Treasurers levee I had
even got Mr ArmySecretary Walpole to take a hundred guineas as a
compliment and he had promised me a majority when bad luck turned and
all my fine hopes were overthrown in a twinkling

You see my dear that after we had left that gaby Galgensteinha
hawith a gag in his mouth and twopencehalfpenny in his pocket the
honest Count was in the sorriest plight in the world owing money here
and there to tradesmen a cool thousand to the Warwickshire Squire and
all this on eighty pounds a year Well for a little time the tradesmen
held their hands while the jolly Count moved heaven and earth to
catch hold of his dear Corporal and his dear moneybags over again and
placarded every town from London to Liverpool with descriptions of my
pretty person The bird was flown howeverthe money clean goneand
when there was no hope of regaining it what did the creditors do but
clap my gay gentleman into Shrewsbury gaol where I wish he had rotted
for my part

But no such luck for honest Peter Brock or Captain Wood as he was in
those days One blessed Monday I went to wait on Mr Secretary and
he squeezed my hand and whispered to me that I was to be Major of a
regiment in Virginiathe very thing for you see my dear I didnt
care about joining my Lord Duke in Flanders being pretty well known
to the army there The Secretary squeezed my hand it had a fiftypound
bill in it and wished me joy and called me Major and bowed me out of
his closet into the anteroom and as gay as may be I went off to
the Tiltyard Coffeehouse in Whitehall which is much frequented by
gentlemen of our profession where I bragged not a little of my good
luck

Amongst the company were several of my acquaintance and amongst them
a gentleman I did not much care to see look you I saw a uniform that
I knewred and yellow facingsCuttss my dear and the wearer of this
was no other than his Excellency Gustavus Adolphus Maximilian whom we
all know of

He stared me full in the face right into my eye tother one was
patched you know and after standing stockstill with his mouth open
gave a step back and then a step forward and then screeched out Its
Brock

I beg your pardon sir says I did you speak to me

Ill SWEAR its Brock cries Gal as soon as he hears my voice and
laid hold of my cuff a pretty bit of Mechlin as ever you saw by the
way

Sirrah says I drawing it back and giving my Lord a little touch
of the fist just at the last button of the waistcoat my deara rare
place if you wish to prevent a man from speaking too much it sent him
reeling to the other end of the room Ruffian says I Dog says
I Insolent puppy and coxcomb what do you mean by laying your hand on
me

Faith Major you giv him his BILLYFUL roared out a long Irish
unattached ensign that I had treated with many a glass of Nantz at the
tavern And so indeed I had for the wretch could not speak for some
minutes and all the officers stood laughing at him as he writhed and
wriggled hideously

Gentlemen this is a monstrous scandal says one officer Men of
rank and honour at fists like a parcel of carters

Men of honour says the Count who had fetched up his breath by this
time I made for the door but Macshane held me and said Major you
are not going to shirk him sure Whereupon I gripped his hand and
vowed I would have the dogs life

Men of honour says the Count I tell you the man is a deserter a
thief and a swindler He was my corporal and ran away with a thou

Dog you lie I roared out and made another cut at him with my cane
but the gentlemen rushed between us

O bluthanowns says honest Macshane the lying scounthrel this
fellow is Gentlemen I swear be me honour that Captain Wood was wounded
at Barcelona and that I saw him there and that he and I ran away
together at the battle of Almanza and bad luck to us

You see my dear that these Irish have the strongest imaginations in
the world and that I had actually persuaded poor Mac that he and I were
friends in Spain Everybody knew Mac who was a character in his way
and believed him

Strike a gentleman says I Ill have your blood I will

This instant says the Count who was boiling with fury and where
you like

Montague House says I Good says he And off we went In
good time too for the constables came in at the thought of such a
disturbance and wanted to take us in charge

But the gentlemen present being military men would not hear of
this Out came Macs rapier and that of halfadozen others and the
constables were then told to do their duty if they liked or to take a
crownpiece and leave us to ourselves Off they went and presently in
a couple of coaches the Count and his friends I and mine drove off to
the fields behind Montague House Oh that vile coffeehouse why did I
enter it

We came to the ground Honest Macshane was my second and much
disappointed because the second on the other side would not make a fight
of it and exchange a few passes with him but he was an old major
a cool old hand as brave as steel and no fool Well the swords
are measured Galgenstein strips off his doublet and I my handsome
cutvelvet in like fashion Galgenstein flings off his hat and I handed
mine overthe lace on it cost me twenty pounds I longed to be at him
forcurse himI hate him and know that he has no chance with me at
swordsplay

Youll not fight in that periwig sure says Macshane Of course
not says I and took it off

May all barbers be roasted in flames may all periwigs bobwigs
scratchwigs and Ramillies cocks frizzle in purgatory from this day
forth to the end of time Mine was the ruin of me what might I not have
been now but for that wig

I gave it over to Ensign Macshane and with it went what I had quite
forgotten the large patch which I wore over one eye which popped out
fierce staring and lively as was ever any eye in the world

Come on says I and made a lunge at my Count but he sprang back
the dog was as active as a hare and knew from old times that I was
his master with the smallsword and his second wondering struck up
my blade

I will not fight that man says he looking mighty pale I swear
upon my honour that his name is Peter Brock he was for two years
my corporal and deserted running away with a thousand pounds of my
moneys Look at the fellow What is the matter with his eye why did he
wear a patch over it But stop says he I have more proof Hand me
my pocketbook And from it sure enough he produced the infernal
proclamation announcing my desertion See if the fellow has a scar
across his left ear and I cant say my dear but what I have it was
done by a cursed Dutchman at the Boyne Tell me if he has not got
CR in blue upon his right arm and there it is sure enough Yonder
swaggering Irishman may be his accomplice for what I know but I will
have no dealings with Mr Brock save with a constable for a second

This is an odd story Captain Wood said the old Major who acted for
the Count

A scounthrelly falsehood regarding me and my friend shouted out Mr
Macshane and the Count shall answer for it

Stop stop says the Major Captain Wood is too gallant a gentleman
I am sure not to satisfy the Count and will show us that he has no
such mark on his arm as only private soldiers put there

Captain Wood says I will do no such thing Major Ill fight that
scoundrel Galgenstein or you or any of you like a man of honour but
I wont submit to be searched like a thief

No in coorse said Macshane

I must take my man off the ground says the Major

Well take him sir says I in a rage and just let me have the
pleasure of telling him that hes a coward and a liar and that my
lodgings are in Piccadilly where if ever he finds courage to meet me
he may hear of me

Faugh I shpit on ye all cries my gallant ally Macshane And sure
enough he kept his word or all butsuiting the action to it at any
rate

And so we gathered up our clothes and went back in our separate
coaches and no blood spilt

And is it thrue now said Mr Macshane when we were aloneis
it thrue now all these divvles have been saying Ensign says I
youre a man of the world

Deed and I am and insign these twentytwo years

Perhaps youd like a few pieces says I

Faith and I should for to tell you the secred thrut Ive not tasted
mate these four days

Well then Ensign it IS true says I and as for meat you shall
have some at the first cookshop I bade the coach stop until he bought
a plateful which he ate in the carriage for my time was precious I
just told him the whole story at which he laughed and swore that it
was the best piece of GENERALSHIP he ever heard on When his belly was
full I took out a couple of guineas and gave them to him Mr Macshane
began to cry at this and kissed me and swore he never would desert me
as indeed my dear I dont think he will for we have been the best of
friends ever since and hes the only man I ever could trust I think

I dont know what put it into my head but I had a scent of some
mischief in the wind so stopped the coach a little before I got home
and turning into a tavern begged Macshane to go before me to my
lodging and see if the coast was clear which he did and came back to
me as pale as death saying that the house was full of constables The
cursed quarrel at the Tiltyard had I suppose set the beaks upon me
and a pretty sweep they made of it Ah my dear five hundred pounds
in money five suits of laced clothes three periwigs besides laced
shirts swords canes and snuffboxes and all to go back to that
scoundrel Count

It was all over with me I sawno more being a gentleman for me and
if I remained to be caught only a choice between Tyburn and a file
of grenadiers My love under such circumstances a gentleman cant be
particular and must be prompt the liverystable was hard by where I
used to hire my coach to go to Courtha haand was known as a man
of substance Thither I went immediately Mr Warmmash says I
my gallant friend here and I have a mind for a ride and a supper at
Twickenham so you must lend us a pair of your best horses Which he
did in a twinkling and off we rode

We did not go into the Park but turned off and cantered smartly up
towards Kilburn and when we got into the country galloped as if
the devil were at our heels Bless you my love it was all done in
a minute and the Ensign and I found ourselves regular knights of the
road before we knew where we were almost Only think of our finding you
and your new husband at the Three Rooks Theres not a greater fence
than the landlady in all the country It was she that put us on seizing
your husband and introduced us to the other two gentlemen whose names
I dont know any more than the dead

And what became of the horses said Mrs Catherine to Mr Brock when
his tale was finished

Rips madam said he mere rips We sold them at Stourbridge fair
and got but thirteen guineas for the two

Andandthe Count Max where is he Brock sighed she

Whew whistled Mr Brock What hankering after him still My dear
he is off to Flanders with his regiment and I make no doubt there
have been twenty Countesses of Galgenstein since your time

I dont believe any such thing sir said Mrs Catherine starting up
very angrily

If you did I suppose youd laudanum him wouldnt you

Leave the room fellow said the lady But she recollected herself
speedily again and clasping her hands and looking very wretched
at Brock at the ceiling at the floor at her husband from whom she
violently turned away her head she began to cry piteously to which
tears the Corporal set up a gentle accompaniment of whistling as they
trickled one after another down her nose

I dont think they were tears of repentance but of regret for the time
when she had her first love and her fine clothes and her white hat and
blue feather Of the two the Corporals whistle was much more innocent
than the girls sobbing he was a rogue but a goodnatured old fellow
when his humour was not crossed Surely our novelwriters make a great
mistake in divesting their rascals of all gentle human qualities
they have suchand the only sad point to think of is in all private
concerns of life abstract feelings and dealings with friends and
so on how dreadfully like a rascal is to an honest man The man who
murdered the Italian boy set him first to play with his children whom
he loved and who doubtless deplored his loss



CHAPTER VI ADVENTURES OF THE AMBASSADOR MR MACSHANE


If we had not been obliged to follow history in all respects it
is probable that we should have left out the last adventure of Mrs
Catherine and her husband at the inn at Worcester altogether for in
truth very little came of it and it is not very romantic or striking
But we are bound to stick closely above all by THE TRUTHthe truth
though it be not particularly pleasant to read of or to tell As anybody
may read in the Newgate Calendar Mr and Mrs Hayes were taken at
an inn at Worcester were confined there were swindled by persons who
pretended to impress the bridegroom for military service What is one
to do after that Had we been writing novels instead of authentic
histories we might have carried them anywhere else we chose and we
had a great mind to make Hayes philosophising with Bolingbroke like a
certain Devereux and Mrs Catherine maitresse en titre to Mr Alexander
Pope Doctor Sacheverel Sir John Reade the oculist Dean Swift
or Marshal Tallard as the very commonest romancer would under such
circumstances But alas and alas truth must be spoken whatever else
is in the wind and the excellent Newgate Calendar which contains the
biographies and thanatographies of Hayes and his wife does not say a
word of their connections with any of the leading literary or military
heroes of the time of Her Majesty Queen Anne The Calendar says in so
many words that Hayes was obliged to send to his father in Warwickshire
for money to get him out of the scrape and that the old gentleman came
down to his aid By this truth must we stick and not for the sake of
the most brilliant episodeno not for a bribe of twenty extra guineas
per sheet would we depart from it

Mr Brocks account of his adventure in London has given the reader
some short notice of his friend Mr Macshane Neither the wits nor the
principles of that worthy Ensign were particularly firm for drink
poverty and a crack on the skull at the battle of Steenkirk had served
to injure the former and the Ensign was not in his best days possessed
of any share of the latter He had really at one period held such a
rank in the army but pawned his halfpay for drink and play and for
many years past had lived one of the hundred thousand miracles of our
city upon nothing that anybody knew of or of which he himself could
give any account Who has not a catalogue of these men in his list
who can tell whence comes the occasional clean shirt who supplies
the continual means of drunkenness who wards off the dailyimpending
starvation Their life is a wonder from day to day their breakfast
a wonder their dinner a miracle their bed an interposition of
Providence If you and I my dear sir want a shilling tomorrow who
will give it us Will OUR butchers give us muttonchops will OUR
laundresses clothe us in clean linennot a bone or a rag Standing as
we do may it be ever so somewhat removed from want is there one of
us who does not shudder at the thought of descending into the lists to
combat with it and expect anything but to be utterly crushed in the
encounter

  The author it must be remembered has his lodgings and
 food provided for him by the government of his country

Not a bit of it my dear sir It takes much more than you think for to
starve a man Starvation is very little when you are used to it Some
people I know even who live on it quite comfortably and make their
daily bread by it It had been our friend Macshanes sole profession for
many years and he did not fail to draw from it such a livelihood as was
sufficient and perhaps too good for him He managed to dine upon it
a certain or rather uncertain number of days in the week to sleep
somewhere and to get drunk at least three hundred times a year He
was known to one or two noblemen who occasionally helped him with a
few pieces and whom he helped in turnnever mind how He had
other acquaintances whom he pestered undauntedly and from whom he
occasionally extracted a dinner or a crown or mayhap by mistake a
goldheaded cane which found its way to the pawnbrokers When flush of
cash he would appear at the coffeehouse when low in funds the deuce
knows into what mystic caves and dens he slunk for food and lodging He
was perfectly ready with his sword and when sober or better still a
very little tipsy was a complete master of it in the art of boasting
and lying he had hardly any equals in shoes he stood six feet five
inches and here is his complete signalement It was a fact that he had
been in Spain as a volunteer where he had shown some gallantry had had
a brainfever and was sent home to starve as before

Mr Macshane had however like Mr Conrad the Corsair one virtue in
the midst of a thousand crimeshe was faithful to his employer for the
time being and a story is told of him which may or may not be to
his credit viz that being hired on one occasion by a certain lord to
inflict a punishment upon a roturier who had crossed his lordship in
his amours he Macshane did actually refuse from the person to be
belaboured and who entreated his forbearance a larger sum of
money than the nobleman gave him for the beating which he performed
punctually as bound in honour and friendship This tale would the
Ensign himself relate with much selfsatisfaction and when after the
sudden flight from London he and Brock took to their roving occupation
he cheerfully submitted to the latter as his commanding officer called
him always Major and bating blunders and drunkenness was perfectly
true to his leader He had a notionand indeed I dont know that
it was a wrong onethat his profession was now as before strictly
military and according to the rules of honour Robbing he called
plundering the enemy and hanging was in his idea a dastardly and
cruel advantage that the latter took and that called for the sternest
reprisals

The other gentlemen concerned were strangers to Mr Brock who felt
little inclined to trust either of them upon such a message or with
such a large sum to bring back They had strange to say a similar
mistrust on their side but Mr Brock lugged out five guineas which he
placed in the landladys hand as security for his comrades return and
Ensign Macshane being mounted on poor Hayess own horse set off to
visit the parents of that unhappy young man It was a gallant sight to
behold our thieves ambassador in a faded skyblue suit with orange
facings in a pair of huge jackboots unconscious of blacking with
a mighty baskethilted sword by his side and a little shabby beaver
cocked over a large towperiwig ride out from the inn of the Three
Rooks on his mission to Hayess paternal village

It was eighteen miles distant from Worcester but Mr Macshane performed
the distance in safety and in sobriety moreover for such had been his
instructions and had no difficulty in discovering the house of old
Hayes towards which indeed Johns horse trotted incontinently Mrs
Hayes who was knitting at the housedoor was not a little surprised
at the appearance of the wellknown grey gelding and of the stranger
mounted upon it

Flinging himself off the steed with much agility Mr Macshane as soon
as his feet reached the ground brought them rapidly together in order
to make a profound and elegant bow to Mrs Hayes and slapping his
greasy beaver against his heart and poking his periwig almost into the
nose of the old lady demanded whether he had the shooprame honour of
adthressing Misthriss Hees

Having been answered in the affirmative he then proceeded to ask
whether there was a blackguard boy in the house who would take the
horse to the steeble whether he could have a dthrink of smallbeer
or buthermilk being faith uncommon dthry and whether finally he
could be feevored with a few minutes private conversation with her
and Mr Hees on a matther of consitherable impartance All these
preliminaries were to be complied with before Mr Macshane would enter
at all into the subject of his visit The horse and man were cared for
Mr Hayes was called in and not a little anxious did Mrs Hayes grow
in the meanwhile with regard to the fate of her darling son Where is
he How is he Is he dead said the old lady Oh yes Im sure hes
dead

Indeed madam and youre misteeken intirely the young man is
perfectly well in health

Oh praised be Heaven

But mighty cast down in sperrits To misfortunes madam look you the
best of us are subject and a trifling one has fell upon your son

And herewith Mr Macshane produced a letter in the handwriting of young
Hayes of which we have had the good luck to procure a copy It ran
thus

HONORED FATHER AND MOTHERThe bearer of this is a kind gentleman who
has left me in a great deal of trouble Yesterday at this towne I fell
in with some gentlemen of the queenes servas after drinking with
whom I accepted her Majestys mony to enliste Repenting thereof I did
endeavour to escape and in so doing had the misfortune to strike my
superior officer whereby I made myself liable to Death according to
the rules of warr If however I pay twenty ginnys all will be wel
You must give the same to the barer els I shall be shott without fail
on Tewsday morning And so no more from your loving son

JOHN HAYES

From my prison at Bristol this unhappy Monday


When Mrs Hayes read this pathetic missive its success with her
was complete and she was for going immediately to the cupboard and
producing the money necessary for her darling sons release But the
carpenter Hayes was much more suspicious I dont know you sir said
he to the ambassador

Do you doubt my honour sir said the Ensign very fiercely

Why sir replied Mr Hayes I know little about it one way or other
but shall take it for granted if you will explain a little more of this
business

I sildom condescind to explean said Mr Macshane for its not the
custom in my rank but Ill explean anything in reason

Pray will you tell me in what regiment my son is enlisted

In coorse In Colonel Woods fut my dear and a gallant corps it is as
any in the army

And you left him

On me soul only three hours ago having rid like a horsejockey ever
since as in the sacred cause of humanity curse me every man should

As Hayess house was seventy miles from Bristol the old gentleman
thought this was marvellous quick riding and so cut the conversation
short You have said quite enough sir said he to show me there
is some roguery in the matter and that the whole story is false from
beginning to end

At this abrupt charge the Ensign looked somewhat puzzled and then spoke
with much gravity Roguery said he Misthur Hees is a sthrong term
and which in consideration of my friendship for your family I shall
pass over You doubt your sons honour as there wrote by him in black
and white

You have forced him to write said Mr Hayes

The sly old divvles right muttered Mr Macshane aside Well sir
to make a clean breast of it he HAS been forced to write it The story
about the enlistment is a pretty fib if you will from beginning to
end And what then my dear Do you think your sons any better off for
that

Oh where is he screamed Mrs Hayes plumping down on her knees We
WILL give him the money wont we John

I know you will madam when I tell you where he is He is in the hands
of some gentlemen of my acquaintance who are at war with the present
government and no more care about cutting a mans throat than they do
a chickens He is a prisoner madam of our sword and spear If you
choose to ransom him well and good if not peace be with him for
never more shall you see him

And how do I know you wont come back tomorrow for more money asked
Mr Hayes

Sir you have my honour and Id as lieve break my neck as my word
said Mr Macshane gravely Twenty guineas is the bargain Take ten
minutes to talk of ittake it then or leave it its all the same
to me my dear And it must be said of our friend the Ensign that he
meant every word he said and that he considered the embassy on which he
had come as perfectly honourable and regular

And pray what prevents us said Mr Hayes starting up in a rage
from taking hold of you as a surety for him

You wouldnt fire on a flag of truce would ye you dishonourable
ould civilian replied Mr Macshane Besides says he theres more
reasons to prevent you the first is this pointing to his sword here
are two moreand these were pistols and the last and the best of all
is that you might hang me and dthraw me and quarther me an yet never
see so much as the tip of your sons nose again Look you sir we run
mighty risks in our professionits not all play I can tell you
Were obliged to be punctual too or its all up with the thrade If I
promise that your son will die as sure as fate tomorrow morning unless
I return home safe our people MUST keep my promise or else what chance
is there for me You would be down upon me in a moment with a posse of
constables and have me swinging before Warwick gaol Pooh my dear you
never would sacrifice a darling boy like John Hayes let alone his lady
for the sake of my long carcass One or two of our gentlemen have been
taken that way already because parents and guardians would not believe
them

AND WHAT BECAME OF THE POOR CHILDREN said Mrs Hayes who began to
perceive the gist of the argument and to grow dreadfully frightened

Dont lets talk of them maam humanity shudthers at the thought
And herewith Mr Macshane drew his finger across his throat in such a
dreadful way as to make the two parents tremble Its the way of war
madam look you The service I have the honour to belong to is not paid
by the Queen and so were obliged to make our prisoners pay according
to established military practice

No lawyer could have argued his case better than Mr Macshane so far
and he completely succeeded in convincing Mr and Mrs Hayes of the
necessity of ransoming their son Promising that the young man should
be restored to them next morning along with his beautiful lady he
courteously took leave of the old couple and made the best of his way
back to Worcester again The elder Hayes wondered who the lady could
be of whom the ambassador had spoken for their sons elopement was
altogether unknown to them but anger or doubt about this subject was
overwhelmed by their fears for their darling Johns safety Away rode
the gallant Macshane with the money necessary to effect this and it
must be mentioned as highly to his credit that he never once thought
of appropriating the sum to himself or of deserting his comrades in any
way

His ride from Worcester had been a long one He had left that city
at noon but before his return thither the sun had gone down and the
landscape which had been dressed like a prodigal in purple and
gold now appeared like a Quaker in dusky grey and the trees by the
roadside grew black as undertakers or physicians and bending their
solemn heads to each other whispered ominously among themselves and
the mists hung on the common and the cottage lights went out one by
one and the earth and heaven grew black but for some twinkling useless
stars which freckled the ebon countenance of the latter and the
air grew colder and about two oclock the moon appeared a dismal
palefaced rake walking solitary through the deserted sky and about
four mayhap the Dawn wretched prenticeboy opened in the east
the shutters of the Dayin other words more than a dozen hours had
passed Corporal Brock had been relieved by Mr Redcap the latter by
Mr Sicklop the oneeyed gentleman Mrs John Hayes in spite of her
sorrows and bashfulness had followed the example of her husband and
fallen asleep by his sideslept for many hoursand awakened still
under the guardianship of Mr Brocks troop and all parties began
anxiously to expect the return of the ambassador Mr Macshane

That officer who had performed the first part of his journey with such
distinguished prudence and success found the night on his journey
homewards was growing mighty cold and dark and as he was thirsty and
hungry had money in his purse and saw no cause to hurry he determined
to take refuge at an alehouse for the night and to make for Worcester
by dawn the next morning He accordingly alighted at the first inn on
his road consigned his horse to the stable and entering the kitchen
called for the best liquor in the house

A small company was assembled at the inn among whom Mr Macshane took
his place with a great deal of dignity and having a considerable sum
of money in his pocket felt a mighty contempt for his society and soon
let them know the contempt he felt for them After a third flagon of
ale he discovered that the liquor was sour and emptied with much
spluttering and grimaces the remainder of the beer into the fire This
process so offended the parson of the parish who in those good old
times did not disdain to take the post of honour in the chimneynook
that he left his corner looking wrathfully at the offender who without
any more ado instantly occupied it It was a fine thing to hear
the jingling of the twenty pieces in his pocket the oaths which he
distributed between the landlord the guests and the liquorto remark
the sprawl of his mighty jackboots before the sweep of which the timid
guests edged farther and farther away and the languishing leers which
he cast on the landlady as with widespread arms he attempted to seize
upon her

When the ostler had done his duties in the stable he entered the inn
and whispered the landlord that the stranger was riding John Hayess
horse of which fact the host soon convinced himself and did not fail
to have some suspicions of his guest Had he not thought that times
were unquiet horses might be sold and one mans money was as good as
anothers he probably would have arrested the Ensign immediately and
so lost all the profit of the score which the latter was causing every
moment to be enlarged

In a couple of hours with that happy facility which one may have
often remarked in men of the gallant Ensigns nation he had managed to
disgust every one of the landlords other guests and scare them from
the kitchen Frightened by his addresses the landlady too had taken
flight and the host was the only person left in the apartment who
there stayed for interests sake merely and listened moodily to
his tipsy guests conversation In an hour more the whole house was
awakened by a violent noise of howling curses and pots clattering to
and fro Forth issued Mrs Landlady in her nightgear out came John
Ostler with his pitchfork downstairs tumbled Mrs Cook and one or two
guests and found the landlord and ensign on the kitchenfloorthe wig
of the latter lying much singed and emitting strange odours in the
fireplace his face hideously distorted and a great quantity of his
natural hair in the partial occupation of the landlord who had drawn it
and the head down towards him in order that he might have the benefit
of pummelling the latter more at his ease In revenge the landlord was
undermost and the Ensigns arms were working up and down his face and
body like the flaps of a paddlewheel the man of war had clearly the
best of it

The combatants were separated as soon as possible but as soon as the
excitement of the fight was over Ensign Macshane was found to have no
further powers of speech sense or locomotion and was carried by his
late antagonist to bed His sword and pistols which had been placed at
his side at the commencement of the evening were carefully put by
and his pocket visited Twenty guineas in gold a large knifeused
probably for the cutting of breadandcheesesome crumbs of those
delicacies and a paper of tobacco found in the breechespockets and in
the bosom of the skyblue coat the leg of a cold fowl and half of a raw
onion constituted his whole property

These articles were not very suspicious but the beating which the
landlord had received tended greatly to confirm his own and his wifes
doubts about their guest and it was determined to send off in the early
morning to Mr Hayes informing him how a person had lain at their inn
who had ridden thither mounted upon young Hayess horse Off set John
Ostler at earliest dawn but on his way he woke up Mr Justices clerk
and communicated his suspicions to him and Mr Clerk consulted with the
village baker who was always up early and the clerk the baker the
butcher with his cleaver and two gentlemen who were going to work all
adjourned to the inn

Accordingly when Ensign Macshane was in a trucklebed plunged in that
deep slumber which only innocence and drunkenness enjoy in this world
and charming the ears of morn by the regular and melodious music of
his nose a vile plot was laid against him and when about seven of the
clock he woke he found on sitting up in his bed three gentlemen on
each side of it armed and looking ominous One held a constables
staff and albeit unprovided with a warrant would take upon himself the
responsibility of seizing Mr Macshane and of carrying him before his
worship at the hall

Taranouns man said the Ensign springing up in bed and abruptly
breaking off a loud sonorous yawn with which he had opened the business
of the day you wont deteen a gentleman whos on life and death I
give ye my word an affair of honour

How came you by that there horse said the baker

How came you by these here fifteen guineas said the landlord in
whose hands by some process five of the gold pieces had disappeared

What is this here idolatrous string of beads said the clerk

Mr Macshane the fact is was a Catholic but did not care to own it
for in those days his religion was not popular

Baids Holy Mother of saints give me back them baids said Mr
Macshane clasping his hands They were blest I tell you by his
holiness the popsha I mane they belong to a darling little daughter
I had thats in heaven now and as for the money and the horse I should
like to know how a gentleman is to travel in this counthry without
them

Why you see he may travel in the country to GIT em here shrewdly
remarked the constable and its our belief that neither horse nor
money is honestly come by If his worship is satisfied why so in
course shall we be but there is highwaymen abroad look you and to
our notion you have very much the cut of one

Further remonstrances or threats on the part of Mr Macshane were
useless Although he vowed that he was first cousin to the Duke of
Leinster an officer in Her Majestys service and the dearest friend
Lord Marlborough had his impudent captors would not believe a word of
his statement which further was garnished with a tremendous number
of oaths and he was about eight oclock carried up to the house of
Squire Ballance the neighbouring justice of the peace

When the worthy magistrate asked the crime of which the prisoner had
been guilty the captors looked somewhat puzzled for the moment since
in truth it could not be shown that the Ensign had committed any crime
at all and if he had confined himself to simple silence and thrown
upon them the onus of proving his misdemeanours Justice Ballance must
have let him loose and soundly rated his clerk and the landlord for
detaining an honest gentleman on so frivolous a charge

But this caution was not in the Ensigns disposition and though his
accusers produced no satisfactory charge against him his own words were
quite enough to show how suspicious his character was When asked his
name he gave it in as Captain Geraldine on his way to Ireland
by Bristol on a visit to his cousin the Duke of Leinster He
swore solemnly that his friends the Duke of Marlborough and Lord
Peterborough under both of whom he had served should hear of the
manner in which he had been treated and when the justicea sly old
gentleman and one that read the Gazettes asked him at what battles he
had been present the gallant Ensign pitched on a couple in Spain and in
Flanders which had been fought within a week of each other and vowed
that he had been desperately wounded at both so that at the end of his
examination which had been taken down by the clerk he had been made
to acknowledge as followsCaptain Geraldine six feet four inches in
height thin with a very long red nose and red hair grey eyes and
speaks with a strong Irish accent is the firstcousin of the Duke of
Leinster and in constant communication with him does not know whether
his Grace has any children does not know whereabouts he lives
in London cannot say what sort of a looking man his Grace is is
acquainted with the Duke of Marlborough and served in the dragoons at
the battle of Ramillies at which time he was with my Lord Peterborough
before Barcelona Borrowed the horse which he rides from a friend in
London three weeks since Peter Hobbs ostler swears that it was in
his masters stable four days ago and is the property of John Hayes
carpenter Cannot account for the fifteen guineas found on him by the
landlord says there were twenty says he won them at cards a fortnight
since at Edinburgh says he is riding about the country for his
amusement afterwards says he is on a matter of life and death and
going to Bristol declared last night in the hearing of several
witnesses that he was going to York says he is a man of independent
property and has large estates in Ireland and a hundred thousand
pounds in the Bank of England Has no shirt or stockings and the coat
he wears is marked SS In his boots is written Thomas Rodgers and
in his hat is the name of the Rev Doctor Snoffler

Doctor Snoffler lived at Worcester and had lately advertised in the Hue
and Cry a number of articles taken from his house Mr Macshane said
in reply to this that his hat had been changed at the inn and he was
ready to take his oath that he came thither in a goldlaced one But
this fact was disproved by the oaths of many persons who had seen him at
the inn And he was about to be imprisoned for the thefts which he had
not committed the fact about the hat being that he had purchased it
from a gentleman at the Three Rooks for two pints of beerhe was
about to be remanded when behold Mrs Hayes the elder made her
appearance and to her it was that the Ensign was indebted for his
freedom

Old Hayes had gone to work before the ostler arrived but when his wife
heard the lads message she instantly caused her pillion to be placed
behind the saddle and mounting the grey horse urged the stableboy to
gallop as hard as ever he could to the justices house

She entered panting and alarmed Oh what is your honour going to do
to this honest gentleman said she In the name of Heaven let him go
His time is precioushe has important businessbusiness of life and
death

I tould the jidge so said the Ensign but he refused to take my
wordthe sacred wurrd of honour of Captain Geraldine

Macshane was good at a single lie though easily flustered on an
examination and this was a very creditable stratagem to acquaint Mrs
Hayes with the name that he bore

What you know Captain Geraldine said Mr Ballance who was perfectly
well acquainted with the carpenters wife

In coorse she does Hasnt she known me these tin years Are we not
related Didnt she give me the very horse which I rode and to make
belave tould you Id bought in London

Let her tell her own story Are you related to Captain Geraldine Mrs
Hayes

Yesoh yes

A very elegant connection And you gave him the horse did you of your
own freewill

Oh yes of my own willI would give him anything Do do your honour
let him go His child is dying said the old lady bursting into
tears It may be dead before he gets tobefore he gets there Oh your
honour your honour pray pray dont detain him

The justice did not seem to understand this excessive sympathy on the
part of Mrs Hayes nor did the father himself appear to be nearly so
affected by his childs probable fate as the honest woman who interested
herself for him On the contrary when she made this passionate speech
Captain Geraldine only grinned and said Niver mind my dear If
his honour will keep an honest gentleman for doing nothing why let
himthe law must settle between us and as for the child poor thing
the Lord deliver it

At this Mrs Hayes fell to entreating more loudly than ever and as
there was really no charge against him Mr Ballance was constrained to
let him go

The landlord and his friends were making off rather confused when
Ensign Macshane called upon the former in a thundering voice to stop
and refund the five guineas which he had stolen from him Again the host
swore there were but fifteen in his pocket But when on the Bible the
Ensign solemnly vowed that he had twenty and called upon Mrs Hayes to
say whether yesterday halfanhour before he entered the inn she had
not seen him with twenty guineas and that lady expressed herself ready
to swear that she had Mr Landlord looked more crestfallen than ever
and said that he had not counted the money when he took it and though
he did in his soul believe that there were only fifteen guineas rather
than be suspected of a shabby action he would pay the five guineas out
of his own pocket which he did and with the Ensigns or rather Mrs
Hayess own coin

As soon as they were out of the justices house Mr Macshane in the
fulness of his gratitude could not help bestowing an embrace upon
Mrs Hayes And when she implored him to let her ride behind him to her
darling son he yielded with a very good grace and off the pair set on
John Hayess grey

Who has Nosey brought with him now said Mr Sicklop Brocks oneeyed
confederate who about three hours after the above adventure was
lolling in the yard of the Three Rooks It was our Ensign with the
mother of his captive They had not met with any accident in their ride

I shall now have the shooprame bliss said Mr Macshane with much
feeling as he lifted Mrs Hayes from the saddlethe shooprame bliss
of intwining two harrts that are mead for one another Ours my dear
is a dismal profession but ah dont moments like this make aminds
for years of pain This way my dear Turn to your right then to your
leftmind the stipand the third door round the corner

All these precautions were attended to and after giving his concerted
knock Mr Macshane was admitted into an apartment which he entered
holding his gold pieces in the one hand and a lady by the other

We shall not describe the meeting which took place between mother and
son The old lady wept copiously the young man was really glad to see
his relative for he deemed that his troubles were over Mrs Cat bit
her lips and stood aside looking somewhat foolish Mr Brock counted
the money and Mr Macshane took a large dose of strong waters as a
pleasing solace for his labours dangers and fatigue

When the maternal feelings were somewhat calmed the old lady had
leisure to look about her and really felt a kind of friendship and
goodwill for the company of thieves in which she found herself It
seemed to her that they had conferred an actual favour on her in
robbing her of twenty guineas threatening her sons life and finally
letting him go

Who is that droll old gentleman said she and being told that it was
Captain Wood she dropped him a curtsey and said with much respect
Captain your very humble servant which compliment Mr Brock
acknowledged by a gracious smile and bow And who is this pretty young
lady continued Mrs Hayes

Whyhumohmother you must give her your blessing She is Mrs John
Hayes And herewith Mr Hayes brought forward his interesting lady to
introduce her to his mamma

The news did not at all please the old lady who received Mrs
Catherines embrace with a very sour face indeed However the mischief
was done and she was too glad to get back her son to be on such an
occasion very angry with him So after a proper rebuke she told Mrs
John Hayes that though she never approved of her sons attachment and
thought he married below his condition yet as the evil was done it was
their duty to make the best of it and she for her part would receive
her into her house and make her as comfortable there as she could

I wonder whether she has any more money in that house whispered Mr
Sicklop to Mr Redcap who with the landlady had come to the door of
the room and had been amusing themselves by the contemplation of this
sentimental scene

What a fool that wild Hirishman was not to bleed her for more said
the landlady but hes a poor ignorant Papist Im sure my man
this gentleman had been hanged wouldnt have come away with such a
beggarly sum

Suppose we have some more out of em said Mr Redcap What prevents
us We have got the old mare and the colt tooha haand the pair
of em ought to be worth at least a hundred to us

This conversation was carried on sotto voce and I dont know whether
Mr Brock had any notion of the plot which was arranged by the three
worthies The landlady began it Which punch madam will you take
says she You must have something for the good of the house now you
are in it

In coorse said the Ensign

Certainly said the other three But the old lady said she was anxious
to leave the place and putting down a crownpiece requested the
hostess to treat the gentlemen in her absence Goodbye Captain said
the old lady

Ajew cried the Ensign and long life to you my dear You got me out
of a scrape at the justices yonder and split me but Insign Macshane
will remimber it as long as he lives

And now Hayes and the two ladies made for the door but the landlady
placed herself against it and Mr Sicklop said No no my pretty
madams you aint agoing off so cheap as that neither you are not
going out for a beggarly twenty guineas look youwe must have more

Mr Hayes starting back and cursing his fate fairly burst into tears
the two women screamed and Mr Brock looked as if the proposition both
amused and had been expected by him but not so Ensign Macshane

Major said he clawing fiercely hold of Brocks arms

Ensign said Mr Brock smiling

Arr we or arr we not men of honour

Oh in coorse said Brock laughing and using Macshanes favourite
expression

If we ARR men of honour we are bound to stick to our word and hark
ye you dirty oneeyed scoundrel if you dont immadiately make way for
these leedies and this lilylivered young jontleman whos crying so
the Meejor here and I will lug out and force you And so saying
he drew his great sword and made a pass at Mr Sicklop which that
gentleman avoided and which caused him and his companion to retreat
from the door The landlady still kept her position at it and with a
storm of oaths against the Ensign and against two Englishmen who ran
away from a wild Hirishman swore she would not budge a foot and would
stand there until her dying day

Faith then needs must said the Ensign and made a lunge at the
hostess which passed so near the wretchs throat that she screamed
sank on her knees and at last opened the door

Down the stairs then with great state Mr Macshane led the elder
lady the married couple following and having seen them to the street
took an affectionate farewell of the party whom he vowed that he would
come and see You can walk the eighteen miles aisy between this and
nightfall said he

WALK exclaimed Mr Hayes Why havent we got Ball and shall ride
and tie all the way

Madam cried Macshane in a stern voice honour before everything
Did you not in the presence of his worship vow and declare that you
gave me that horse and now dye talk of taking it back again Let me
tell you madam that such paltry thricks ill become a person of your
years and respectability and ought never to be played with Insign
Timothy Macshane

He waved his hat and strutted down the street and Mrs Catherine Hayes
along with her bridegroom and motherinlaw made the best of their way
homeward on foot



CHAPTER VII WHICH EMBRACES A PERIOD OF SEVEN YEARS


The recovery of so considerable a portion of his property from the
clutches of Brock was as may be imagined no trifling source of joy to
that excellent young man Count Gustavus Adolphus de Galgenstein and
he was often known to say with much archness and a proper feeling of
gratitude to the Fate which had ordained things so that the robbery
was in reality one of the best things that could have happened to him
for in event of Mr Brocks NOT stealing the money his Excellency the
Count would have had to pay the whole to the Warwickshire Squire who
had won it from him at play He was enabled in the present instance to
plead his notorious poverty as an excuse and the Warwickshire conqueror
got off with nothing except a very badly written autograph of the
Counts simply acknowledging the debt

This point his Excellency conceded with the greatest candour but as
doubtless the reader may have remarked in the course of his experience
to owe is not quite the same thing as to pay and from the day of his
winning the money until the day of his death the Warwickshire Squire
did never by any chance touch a single bob tizzy tester moidore
maravedi doubloon tomaun or rupee of the sum which Monsieur de
Galgenstein had lost to him

That young nobleman was as Mr Brock hinted in the little
autobiographical sketch which we gave in a former chapter incarcerated
for a certain period and for certain other debts in the donjons
of Shrewsbury but he released himself from them by that noble and
consolatory method of whitewashing which the law has provided for
gentlemen in his oppressed condition and he had not been a week in
London when he fell in with and overcame or put to flight Captain
Wood alias Brock and immediately seized upon the remainder of his
property After receiving this the Count with commendable discretion
disappeared from England altogether for a while nor are we at all
authorised to state that any of his debts to his tradesmen were
discharged any more than his debts of honour as they are pleasantly
called

Having thus settled with his creditors the gallant Count had interest
enough with some of the great folk to procure for himself a post abroad
and was absent in Holland for some time It was here that he became
acquainted with the lovely Madam Silverkoop the widow of a deceased
gentleman of Leyden and although the lady was not at that age at which
tender passions are usually inspiredbeing sixtyand though she could
not like Mademoiselle Ninon de lEnclos then at Paris boast of charms
which defied the progress of timefor Mrs Silverkoop was as red as a
boiled lobster and as unwieldy as a porpoise and although her mental
attractions did by no means make up for her personal deficienciesfor
she was jealous violent vulgar drunken and stingy to a miracle
yet her charms had an immediate effect on Monsieur de Galgenstein and
hence perhaps the reader the rogue how well he knows the world
will be led to conclude that the honest widow was RICH

Such indeed she was and Count Gustavus despising the difference
between his twenty quarterings and her twenty thousand pounds laid the
most desperate siege to her and finished by causing her to capitulate
as I do believe after a reasonable degree of pressing any woman will
do to any man such at least has been MY experience in the matter

The Count then married and it was curious to see how hewho as
we have seen in the case of Mrs Cat had been as great a tiger and
domestic bully as any extantnow by degrees fell into a quiet
submission towards his enormous Countess who ordered him up and down as
a lady orders her footman who permitted him speedily not to have a will
of his own and who did not allow him a shilling of her money without
receiving for the same an accurate account

How was it that he the abject slave of Madam Silverkoop had been
victorious over Mrs Cat The first blow is I believe the decisive
one in these cases and the Countess had stricken it a week after their
marriageestablishing a supremacy which the Count never afterwards
attempted to question

We have alluded to his Excellencys marriage as in duty bound because
it will be necessary to account for his appearance hereafter in a more
splendid fashion than that under which he has hitherto been known to us
and just comforting the reader by the knowledge that the union though
prosperous in a worldly point of view was in reality extremely
unhappy we must say no more from this time forth of the fat and
legitimate Madam de Galgenstein Our darling is Mrs Catherine who had
formerly acted in her stead and only in so much as the fat Countess
did influence in any way the destinies of our heroine or those wise
and virtuous persons who have appeared and are to follow her to her end
shall we in any degree allow her name to figure here It is an awful
thing to get a glimpse as one sometimes does when the time is past of
some little little wheel which works the whole mighty machinery of FATE
and see how our destinies turn on a minutes delay or advance or on the
turning of a street or on somebody elses turning of a street or
on somebody elses doing of something else in Downing Street or in
Timbuctoo now or a thousand years ago Thus for instance if Miss
Poots in the year 1695 had never been the lovely inmate of a Spielhaus
at Amsterdam Mr Van Silverkoop would never have seen her if the day
had not been extraordinarily hot the worthy merchant would never have
gone thither if he had not been fond of Rhenish wine and sugar he
never would have called for any such delicacies if he had not called
for them Miss Ottilia Poots would never have brought them and partaken
of them if he had not been rich she would certainly have rejected all
the advances made to her by Silverkoop if he had not been so fond of
Rhenish and sugar he never would have died and Mrs Silverkoop would
have been neither rich nor a widow nor a wife to Count von Galgenstein
Nay nor would this history have ever been written for if Count
Galgenstein had not married the rich widow Mrs Catherine would never
have

Oh my dear madam you thought we were going to tell you Pooh
nonsenseno such thing not for two or three and seventy pages or
sowhen perhaps you MAY know what Mrs Catherine never would have
done

The reader will remember in the second chapter of these Memoirs the
announcement that Mrs Catherine had given to the world a child who
might bear if he chose the arms of Galgenstein with the further
adornment of a barsinister This child had been put out to nurse some
time before its mothers elopement from the Count and as that nobleman
was in funds at the time having had that success at play which we duly
chronicled he paid a sum of no less than twenty guineas which was to
be the yearly reward of the nurse into whose charge the boy was put The
woman grew fond of the brat and when after the first year she had no
further news or remittances from father or mother she determined for
a while at least to maintain the infant at her own expense for when
rebuked by her neighbours on this score she stoutly swore that no
parents could ever desert their children and that some day or other she
should not fail to be rewarded for her trouble with this one

Under this strange mental hallucination poor Goody Billings who had
five children and a husband of her own continued to give food and
shelter to little Tom for a period of no less than seven years and
though it must be acknowledged that the young gentleman did not in the
slightest degree merit the kindnesses shown to him Goody Billings who
was of a very soft and pitiful disposition continued to bestow them
upon him because she said he was lonely and unprotected and deserved
them more than other children who had fathers and mothers to look after
them If then any difference was made between Toms treatment and that
of her own brood it was considerably in favour of the former to whom
the largest proportions of treacle were allotted for his bread and
the handsomest supplies of hasty pudding Besides to do Mrs Billings
justice there WAS a party against him and that consisted not only of
her husband and her five children but of every single person in the
neighbourhood who had an opportunity of seeing and becoming acquainted
with Master Tom

A celebrated philosopherI think Miss Edgeworthhas broached the
consolatory doctrine that in intellect and disposition all human beings
are entirely equal and that circumstance and education are the causes
of the distinctions and divisions which afterwards unhappily take place
among them Not to argue this question which places Jack Howard and
Jack Thurtell on an exact levelwhich would have us to believe that
Lord Melbourne is by natural gifts and excellences a man as honest
brave and farsighted as the Duke of Wellingtonwhich would make out
that Lord Lyndhurst is in point of principle eloquence and political
honesty no better than Mr OConnellnot I say arguing this
doctrine let us simply state that Master Thomas Billings for having
no other he took the name of the worthy people who adopted him was in
his longcoats fearfully passionate screaming and roaring perpetually
and showing all the ill that he COULD show At the age of two when
his strength enabled him to toddle abroad his favourite resort was
the coalhole or the dungheap his roarings had not diminished in the
least and he had added to his former virtues two new onesa love
of fighting and stealing both which amiable qualities he had many
opportunities of exercising every day He fought his little adoptive
brothers and sisters he kicked and cuffed his father and mother he
fought the cat stamped upon the kittens was worsted in a severe battle
with the hen in the backyard but in revenge nearly beat a little
suckingpig to death whom he caught alone and rambling near his
favourite haunt the dunghill As for stealing he stole the eggs
which he perforated and emptied the butter which he ate with or
without bread as he could find it the sugar which he cunningly
secreted in the leaves of a Bakers Chronicle that nobody in the
establishment could read and thus from the pages of history he used to
suck in all he knewthieving and lying namely in which for his years
he made wonderful progress If any followers of Miss Edgeworth and the
philosophers are inclined to disbelieve this statement or to set it
down as overcharged and distorted let them be assured that just this
very picture was of all the pictures in the world taken from nature
I Ikey Solomons once had a dear little brother who could steal before
he could walk and this not from encouragementfor if you know the
world you must know that in families of our profession the point of
honour is sacred at homebut from pure naturewho could steal I
say before he could walk and lie before he could speak and who at
four and a half years of age having attacked my sister Rebecca on some
question of lollipops had smitten her on the elbow with a fireshovel
apologising to us by saying simply  her I wish it had been her
head Dear dear Aminadab I think of you and laugh these philosophers
to scorn Nature made you for that career which you fulfilled you
were from your birth to your dying a scoundrel you COULDNT have been
anything else however your lot was cast and blessed it was that you
were born among the prigsfor had you been of any other profession
alas alas what ills might you have done As I have heard the author of
Richelieu Siamese Twins etc say Poeta nascitur non fit which
means that though he had tried ever so much to be a poet it was all
moonshine in the like manner I say ROAGUS nascitur non fit We
have it from nature and so a fig for Miss Edgeworth

In this manner then while his father blessed with a wealthy wife was
leading in a fine house the life of a galleyslave while his mother
married to Mr Hayes and made an honest women of as the saying is was
passing her time respectably in Warwickshire Mr Thomas Billings
was inhabiting the same county not cared for by either of them but
ordained by Fate to join them one day and have a mighty influence upon
the fortunes of both For as it has often happened to the traveller in
the York or the Exeter coach to fall snugly asleep in his corner and on
awaking suddenly to find himself sixty or seventy miles from the place
where Somnus first visited him as we say although you sit still
Time poor wretch keeps perpetually running on and so must run day
and night with never a pause or a halt of five minutes to get a drink
until his dying day let the reader imagine that since he left Mrs
Hayes and all the other worthy personages of this history in the last
chapter seven years have sped away during which all our heroes and
heroines have been accomplishing their destinies

Seven years of country carpentering or rather trading on the part of a
husband of ceaseless scolding violence and discontent on the part of
a wife are not pleasant to describe so we shall omit altogether
any account of the early married life of Mr and Mrs John Hayes The
Newgate Calendar to which excellent compilation we and the OTHER
popular novelists of the day can never be sufficiently grateful states
that Hayes left his house three or four times during this period and
urged by the restless humours of his wife tried several professions
returning however as he grew weary of each to his wife and his
paternal home After a certain time his parents died and by their
demise he succeeded to a small property and the carpentering business
which he for some time followed

What then in the meanwhile had become of Captain Wood or Brock
and Ensign Macshanethe only persons now to be accounted for in our
catalogue For about six months after their capture and release of
Mr Hayes those noble gentlemen had followed with much prudence and
success that trade which the celebrated and polite Duval the ingenious
Sheppard the dauntless Turpin and indeed many other heroes of our most
popular novels had pursuedor were pursuing in their time And so
considerable were said to be Captain Woods gains that reports were
abroad of his having somewhere a buried treasure to which he might have
added more had not Fate suddenly cut short his career as a prig He
and the Ensign wereshame to saytransported for stealing three
pewterpots off a railing at Exeter and not being known in the town
which they had only reached that morning they were detained by
no further charges but simply condemned on this one For this
misdemeanour Her Majestys Government vindictively sent them for seven
years beyond the sea and as the fashion then was sold the use of
their bodies to Virginian planters during that space of time It is
thus alas that the strong are always used to deal with the weak and
many an honest fellow has been led to rue his unfortunate difference
with the law

Thus then we have settled all scores The Count is in Holland with his
wife Mrs Cat in Warwickshire along with her excellent husband Master
Thomas Billings with his adoptive parents in the same county and the
two military gentlemen watching the progress and cultivation of the
tobacco and cotton plant in the New World All these things having
passed between the acts dingaringadingaringadingledingleding the
drop draws up and the next act begins By the way the play ENDS with a
drop but that is neither here nor there

 

Here as in a theatre the orchestra is supposed to play something
melodious The people get up shake themselves yawn and settle down
in their seats again Porter ale gingerbeer cider comes round
squeezing through the legs of the gentlemen in the pit Nobody takes
anything as usual and lo the curtain rises again Sh shsh
shshshhh Hats off says everybody

 

Mrs Hayes had now been for six years the adored wife of Mr Hayes and
no offspring had arisen to bless their loves and perpetuate their name
She had obtained a complete mastery over her lord and master and
having had as far as was in that gentlemans power every single wish
gratified that she could demand in the way of dress treats to Coventry
and Birmingham drink and what notfor though a hard man John Hayes
had learned to spend his money pretty freely on himself and herhaving
had all her wishes gratified it was natural that she should begin to
find out some more and the next whim she hit upon was to be restored
to her child It may be as well to state that she had never informed her
husband of the existence of that phenomenon although he was aware
of his wifes former connection with the CountMrs Hayes in their
matrimonial quarrels invariably taunting him with accounts of her
former splendour and happiness and with his own meanness of taste in
condescending to take up with his Excellencys leavings

She determined then but as yet had not confided her determination
to her husband she would have her boy although in her seven years
residence within twenty miles of him she had never once thought of
seeing him and the kind reader knows that when his excellent lady
determines on a thinga shawl or an operabox or a new carriage or
twentyfour singinglessons from Tamburini or a night at the Eagle
Tavern City Road or a ride in a bus to Richmond and tea and
brandyandwater at Rose Cottage Hotelthe reader high or low knows
that when Mrs Reader desires a thing have it she will you may just as
well talk of avoiding her as of avoiding gout bills or grey hairsand
that you know is impossible I for my part have had all threeay
and a wife too

I say that when a woman is resolved on a thing happen it will if
husbands refuse Fate will interfere flectere si nequeo etc but
quotations are odious And some hidden power was working in the case of
Mrs Hayes and for its own awful purposes lending her its aid

Who has not felt how he worksthe dreadful conquering Spirit of
Ill Who cannot see in the circle of his own society the fated and
foredoomed to woe and evil Some call the doctrine of destiny a dark
creed but for me I would fain try and think it a consolatory one It
is better with all ones sins upon ones head to deem oneself in
the hands of Fate than to thinkwith our fierce passions and weak
repentances with our resolves so loud so vain so ludicrously
despicably weak and frail with our dim wavering wretched conceits
about virtue and our irresistible propensity to wrongthat we are the
workers of our future sorrow or happiness If we depend on our strength
what is it against mighty circumstance If we look to ourselves what
hope have we Look back at the whole of your life and see how Fate has
mastered you and it Think of your disappointments and your successes
Has YOUR striving influenced one or the other A fit of indigestion puts
itself between you and honours and reputation an apple plops on your
nose and makes you a worlds wonder and glory a fit of poverty makes a
rascal of you who were and are still an honest man clubs trumps
or six lucky mains at dice make an honest man for life of you who ever
were will be and are a rascal Who sends the illness who causes the
apple to fall who deprives you of your worldly goods or who shuffles
the cards and brings trumps honour virtue and prosperity back again
You call it chance ay and so it is chance that when the floor
gives way and the rope stretches tight the poor wretch before St
Sepulchres clock dies Only with us clearsighted mortals as we are
we cant SEE the rope by which we hang and know not when or how the
drop may fall

But revenons a nos moutons let us return to that sweet lamb Master
Thomas and the milkwhite ewe Mrs Cat Seven years had passed away
and she began to think that she should very much like to see her child
once more It was written that she should and you shall hear how soon
after without any great exertions of hers back he came to her

In the month of July in the year 1715 there came down a road about
ten miles from the city of Worcester two gentlemen not mounted
Templarlike upon one horse but having a horse between thema sorry
bay with a sorry saddle and a large pack behind it on which each by
turn took a ride Of the two one was a man of excessive stature with
red hair a very prominent nose and a faded military dress while the
other an old weatherbeaten soberlooking personage wore the
costume of a civilianboth man and dress appearing to have reached the
autumnal or seedy state However the pair seemed in spite of their
apparent poverty to be passably merry The old gentleman rode the
horse and had in the course of their journey ridden him two miles at
least in every three The tall one walked with immense strides by his
side and seemed indeed as if he could have quickly outstripped
the fourfooted animal had he chosen to exert his speed or had not
affection for his comrade retained him at his stirrup

A short time previously the horse had cast a shoe and this the tall
man on foot had gathered up and was holding in his hand it having been
voted that the first blacksmith to whose shop they should come should be
called upon to fit it again upon the bay horse

Do you remimber this counthry Meejor said the tall man who was
looking about him very much pleased and sucking a flower I think
thim green cornfields is prettier looking at than the d tobacky out
yondther and bad lack to it

I recollect the place right well and some queer pranks we played here
seven years agone responded the gentleman addressed as Major You
remember that man and his wife whom we took in pawn at the Three
Rooks

And the landlady only hung last Michaelmas said the tall man
parenthetically

Hang the landladyweve got all we ever would out of HER you know
But about the man and woman You went after the chaps mother and like
a jackass as you are let him loose Well the woman was that Catherine
that youve often heard me talk about I like the wench  her for
I almost brought her up and she was for a year or two along with that
scoundrel Galgenstein who has been the cause of my ruin

The infernal blackguard and ruffian said the tall man who with his
companion has no doubt been recognised by the reader

Well this Catherine had a child by Galgenstein and somewhere here
hard by the woman lived to whom we carried the brat to nurse She was
the wife of a blacksmith one Billings it wont be out of the way to
get our horse shod at his house if he is alive still and we may learn
something about the little beast I should be glad to see the mother
well enough

Do I remimber her said the Ensign Do I remimber whisky Sure I
do and the snivelling sneak her husband and the stout old lady her
motherinlaw and the dirty oneeyed ruffian who sold me the parsons
hat that had so nearly brought me into trouble Oh but it was a rare
rise we got out of them chaps and the old landlady thats hanged too
And here both Ensign Macshane and Major Brock or Wood grinned and
showed much satisfaction

It will be necessary to explain the reason of it We gave the British
public to understand that the landlady of the Three Rooks at
Worcester was a notorious fence or banker of thieves that is a
purchaser of their merchandise In her hands Mr Brock and his companion
had left property to the amount of sixty or seventy pounds which was
secreted in a cunning recess in a chamber of the Three Rooks known
only to the landlady and the gentlemen who banked with her and in
this place Mr Sicklop the oneeyed man who had joined in the Hayes
adventure his comrade and one or two of the topping prigs of the
county were free Mr Sicklop had been shot dead in a night attack near
Bath the landlady had been suddenly hanged as an accomplice in another
case of robbery and when on their return from Virginia our two
heroes whose hopes of livelihood depended upon it had bent their steps
towards Worcester they were not a little frightened to hear of the
cruel fate of the hostess and many of the amiable frequenters of the
Three Rooks All the goodly company were separated the house was no
longer an inn Was the money gone too At least it was worth while to
lookwhich Messrs Brock and Macshane determined to do

The house being now a private one Mr Brock with a genius that was
above his station visited its owner with a huge portfolio under his
arm and in the character of a painter requested permission to take a
particular sketch from a particular window The Ensign followed with the
artists materials consisting simply of a screwdriver and a crowbar
and it is hardly necessary to say that when admission was granted
to them they opened the wellknown door and to their inexpressible
satisfaction discovered not their own peculiar savings exactly
for these had been appropriated instantly on hearing of their
transportation but stores of money and goods to the amount of near
three hundred pounds to which Mr Macshane said they had as just and
honourable a right as anybody else And so they had as just a right as
anybodyexcept the original owners but who was to discover them

With this booty they set out on their journeyanywhere for they knew
not whither and it so chanced that when their horses shoe came off
they were within a few furlongs of the cottage of Mr Billings the
blacksmith As they came near they were saluted by tremendous roars
issuing from the smithy A small boy was held across the bellows two or
three children of smaller and larger growth were holding him down and
many others of the village were gazing in at the window while a man
halfnaked was lashing the little boy with a whip and occasioning the
cries heard by the travellers As the horse drew up the operator looked
at the newcomers for a moment and then proceeded incontinently with
his work belabouring the child more fiercely than ever

When he had done he turned round to the newcomers and asked how he
could serve them whereupon Mr Wood for such was the name he adopted
and by such we shall call him to the end wittily remarked that however
he might wish to serve THEM he seemed mightily inclined to serve that
young gentleman first

Its no joking matter said the blacksmith if I dont serve him so
now hell be worse off in his old age Hell come to the gallows as
sure as his name is Billnever mind what his name is And so saying
he gave the urchin another cut which elicited of course another
scream

Oh his name is Bill said Captain Wood

His names NOT Bill said the blacksmith sulkily Hes no name and
no heart neither My wife took the brat in seven years ago from a
beggarly French chap to nurse and she kept him for she was a good
soul here his eyes began to wink and shesshes gone now here
he began fairly to blubber And d him out of love for her I kept
him too and the scoundrel is a liar and a thief This blessed day
merely to vex me and my boys here he spoke ill of her he did and
IllcuthislifeoutIwill and with each word honest Mulciber
applied a whack on the body of little Tom Billings who by shrill
shrieks and oaths in treble acknowledged the receipt of the blows

Come come said Mr Wood set the boy down and the bellows agoing
my horse wants shoeing and the poor lad has had strapping enough

The blacksmith obeyed and cast poor Master Thomas loose As he
staggered away and looked back at his tormentor his countenance assumed
an expression which made Mr Wood say grasping hold of Macshanes
arm Its the boy its the boy When his mother gave Galgenstein the
laudanum she had the selfsame look with her

Had she really now said Mr Macshane And pree Meejor who WAS his
mother

Mrs Cat you fool answered Wood

Then upon my secred word of honour she has a mighty fine KITTEN
anyhow my dear Aha

They dont DROWN such kittens said Mr Wood archly and Macshane
taking the allusion clapped his finger to his nose in token of perfect
approbation of his commanders sentiment

While the blacksmith was shoeing the horse Mr Wood asked him many
questions concerning the lad whom he had just been chastising and
succeeded beyond a doubt in establishing his identity with the child
whom Catherine Hall had brought into the world seven years since
Billings told him of all the virtues of his wife and the manifold
crimes of the lad how he stole and fought and lied and swore and
though the youngest under his roof exercised the most baneful influence
over all the rest of his family He was determined at last he said to
put him to the parish for he did not dare to keep him

Hes a fine whelp and would fetch ten pieces in Virginny sighed the
Ensign

Crimp of Bristol would give five for him said Mr Wood ruminating

Why not take him said the Ensign

Faith why not said Mr Wood His keep meanwhile will not be
sixpence a day Then turning round to the blacksmith Mr Billings
said he you will be surprised perhaps to hear that I know everything
regarding that poor lads history His mother was an unfortunate lady
of high family now no more his father a German nobleman Count de
Galgenstein by name

The very man said Billings a young fairhaired man who came here
with the child and a dragoon sergeant

Count de Galgenstein by name who on the point of death recommended
the infant to me

And did he pay you seven years boarding said Mr Billings who was
quite alive at the very idea

Alas sir not a jot He died sir six hundred pounds in my debt
didnt he Ensign

Six hundred upon my secred honour I remember when he got into the
house along with the poli

Psha what matters it here broke out Mr Wood looking fiercely at
the Ensign Six hundred pounds he owes me how was he to pay you But
he told me to take charge of this boy if I found him and found him I
have and WILL take charge of him if you will hand him over

Send our Tom cried Billings And when that youth appeared scowling
and yet trembling and prepared as it seemed for another castigation
his father to his surprise asked him if he was willing to go along
with those gentlemen or whether he would be a good lad and stay with
him

Mr Tom replied immediately I wont be a good lad and Id rather go
to  than stay with you

Will you leave your brothers and sisters said Billings looking very
dismal

Hang my brothers and sistersI hate em and besides I havent got
any

But you had a good mother hadnt you Tom

Tom paused for a moment

Mothers gone said he and you flog me and Ill go with these men

Well then go thy ways said Billings starting up in a passion go
thy ways for a graceless reprobate and if this gentleman will take you
he may do so

After some further parley the conversation ended and the next morning
Mr Woods party consisted of three a little boy being mounted upon the
bay horse in addition to the Ensign or himself and the whole company
went journeying towards Bristol

 

We have said that Mrs Hayes had on a sudden taken a fit of maternal
affection and was bent upon being restored to her child and that
benign destiny which watched over the life of this lucky lady instantly
set about gratifying her wish and without cost to herself of
coachhire or saddlehorse sent the young gentleman very quickly to her
arms The village in which the Hayeses dwelt was but a very few miles
out of the road from Bristol whither on the benevolent mission above
hinted at our party of worthies were bound and coming towards the
afternoon in sight of the house of that very Justice Ballance who had
been so nearly the ruin of Ensign Macshane that officer narrated for
the hundredth time and with much glee the circumstances which had
then befallen him and the manner in which Mrs Hayes the elder had come
forward to his rescue

Suppose we go and see the old girl suggested Mr Wood No harm can
come to us now And his comrade always assenting they wound their
way towards the village and reached it as the evening came on In the
publichouse where they rested Wood made inquiries concerning the
Hayes family was informed of the death of the old couple of the
establishment of John Hayes and his wife in their place and of the kind
of life that these latter led together When all these points had been
imparted to him he ruminated much an expression of sublime triumph and
exultation at length lighted up his features I think Tim said he at
last that we can make more than five pieces of that boy

Oh in coorse said Timothy Macshane Esquire who always agreed with
his Meejor

In coorse you fool and how Ill tell you how This Hayes is well to
do in the world and

And well nab him againha ha roared out Macshane By my secred
honour Meejor there never was a gineral like you at a strathyjam

Peace you bellowing donkey and dont wake the child The man is well
to do his wife rules him and they have no children Now either she
will be very glad to have the boy back again and pay for the finding of
him or else she has said nothing about him and will pay us for being
silent too or at any rate Hayes himself will be ashamed at finding
his wife the mother of a child a year older than his marriage and will
pay for the keeping of the brat away Theres profit my dear in any
one of the cases or my names not Peter Brock

When the Ensign understood this wondrous argument he would fain have
fallen on his knees and worshipped his friend and guide They began
operations almost immediately by an attack on Mrs Hayes On hearing
as she did in private interview with the excorporal the next morning
that her son was found she was agitated by both of the passions which
Wood attributed to her She longed to have the boy back and would give
any reasonable sum to see him but she dreaded exposure and would pay
equally to avoid that How could she gain the one point and escape the
other

Mrs Hayes hit upon an expedient which I am given to understand is not
uncommon nowadays She suddenly discovered that she had a dear brother
who had been obliged to fly the country in consequence of having joined
the Pretender and had died in France leaving behind him an only son
This boy her brother had with his last breath recommended to her
protection and had confided him to the charge of a brother officer who
was now in the country and would speedily make his appearance and to
put the story beyond a doubt Mr Wood wrote the letter from her
brother stating all these particulars and Ensign Macshane received
full instructions how to perform the part of the brother officer What
consideration Mr Wood received for his services we cannot say only
it is well known that Mr Hayes caused to be committed to gaol a young
apprentice in his service charged with having broken open a cupboard in
which Mr Hayes had forty guineas in gold and silver and to which none
but he and his wife had access

Having made these arrangements the Corporal and his little party
decamped to a short distance and Mrs Catherine was left to prepare
her husband for a speedy addition to his family in the shape of this
darling nephew John Hayes received the news with anything but pleasure
He had never heard of any brother of Catherines she had been bred at
the workhouse and nobody ever hinted that she had relatives but it
is easy for a lady of moderate genius to invent circumstances and with
lies tears threats coaxings oaths and other blandishments she
compelled him to submit

Two days afterwards as Mr Hayes was working in his shop with his lady
seated beside him the trampling of a horse was heard in his courtyard
and a gentleman of huge stature descended from it and strode into the
shop His figure was wrapped in a large cloak but Mr Hayes could not
help fancying that he had somewhere seen his face before

This I preshoom said the gentleman is Misther Hayes that I have
come so many miles to see and this is his amiable lady I was the
most intimate frind madam of your laminted brother who died in King
Lewiss service and whose last touching letthers I despatched to you
two days ago I have with me a further precious token of my dear friend
Captain Hallit is HERE

And so saying the military gentleman with one arm removed his cloak
and stretching forward the other into Hayess face almost stretched
likewise forward a little boy grinning and sprawling in the air and
prevented only from falling to the ground by the hold which the Ensign
kept of the waistband of his little coat and breeches

Isnt he a pretty boy said Mrs Hayes sidling up to her husband
tenderly and pressing one of Mr Hayess hands

 

About the lads beauty it is needless to say what the carpenter thought
but that night and for many many nights after the lad stayed at Mr
Hayess



CHAPTER VIII ENUMERATES THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF MASTER THOMAS
BILLINGSINTRODUCES BROCK AS DOCTOR WOODAND ANNOUNCES THE EXECUTION
OF ENSIGN MACSHANE


We are obliged in recording this history to follow accurately that
great authority the Calendarium Newgaticum Roagorumque Registerium
of which every lover of literature in the present day knows the value
and as that remarkable work totally discards all the unities in its
narratives and reckons the life of its heroes only by their actions
and not by periods of time we must follow in the wake of this mighty
arka humble cockboat When it pauses we pause when it runs ten
knots an hour we run with the same celerity and as in order to carry
the reader from the penultimate chapter of this work unto the last
chapter we were compelled to make him leap over a gap of seven blank
years ten years more must likewise be granted to us before we are at
liberty to resume our history

During that period Master Thomas Billings had been under the especial
care of his mother and as may be imagined he rather increased than
diminished the accomplishments for which he had been remarkable while
under the roof of his fosterfather And with this advantage that while
at the blacksmiths and only three or four years of age his virtues
were necessarily appreciated only in his family circle and among those
few acquaintances of his own time of life whom a youth of three can be
expected to meet in the alleys or over the gutters of a small country
hamletin his mothers residence his circle extended with his own
growth and he began to give proofs of those powers of which in
infancy there had been only encouraging indications Thus it was nowise
remarkable that a child of four years should not know his letters and
should have had a great disinclination to learn them but when a
young man of fifteen showed the same creditable ignorance the
same undeviating dislike it was easy to see that he possessed much
resolution and perseverance When it was remarked too that in case of
any difference he not only beat the usher but by no means disdained to
torment and bully the very smallest boys of the school it was easy to
see that his mind was comprehensive and careful as well as courageous
and grasping As it was said of the Duke of Wellington in the
Peninsula that he had a thought for everybodyfrom Lord Hill to the
smallest drummer in the armyin like manner Tom Billings bestowed HIS
attention on high and low but in the shape of blows he would fight the
strongest and kick the smallest and was always at work with one or the
other At thirteen when he was removed from the establishment whither
he had been sent he was the cock of the school out of doors and the
very last boy in He used to let the little boys and newcomers pass him
by and laugh but he always belaboured them unmercifully afterwards
and then it was he said HIS turn to laugh With such a pugnacious
turn Tom Billings ought to have been made a soldier and might have
died a marshal but by an unlucky ordinance of fate he was made a
tailor and died anever mind what for the present suffice it to say
that he was suddenly cut off at a very early period of his existence
by a disease which has exercised considerable ravages among the British
youth

By consulting the authority above mentioned we find that Hayes did
not confine himself to the profession of a carpenter or remain long
established in the country but was induced by the eager spirit of Mrs
Catherine most probably to try his fortune in the metropolis where he
lived flourished and died Oxford Road Saint Giless and Tottenham
Court were at various periods of his residence in town inhabited
by him At one place he carried on the business of greengrocer and
smallcoalman in another he was carpenter undertaker and lender of
money to the poor finally he was a lodginghouse keeper in the Oxford
or Tyburn Road but continued to exercise the lastnamed charitable
profession

Lending as he did upon pledges and carrying on a pretty large trade
it was not for him of course to inquire into the pedigree of all
the pieces of plate the bales of cloth swords watches wigs
shoebuckles etc that were confided by his friends to his keeping but
it is clear that his friends had the requisite confidence in him and
that he enjoyed the esteem of a class of characters who still live in
history and are admired unto this very day The mind loves to think
that perhaps in Mr Hayess back parlour the gallant Turpin might
have hobandnobbed with Mrs Catherine that here perhaps the noble
Sheppard might have cracked his joke or quaffed his pint of rum Who
knows but that Macheath and Paul Clifford may have crossed legs under
Hayess dinnertable But why pause to speculate on things that might
have been why desert reality for fond imagination or call up from
their honoured graves the sacred dead I know not and yet in sooth I
can never pass Cumberland Gate without a sigh as I think of the gallant
cavaliers who traversed that road in old time Pious priests accompanied
their triumphs their chariots were surrounded by hosts of glittering
javelinmen As the slave at the car of the Roman conqueror shouted
Remember thou art mortal before the eyes of the British warrior rode
the undertaker and his coffin telling him that he too must die Mark
well the spot A hundred years ago Albion Street where comic Power
dwelt Milesias darling sonAlbion Street was a desert The square of
Connaught was without its penultimate and strictly speaking NAUGHT
The Edgware Road was then a road tis true with tinkling waggons
passing now and then and fragrant walls of snowy hawthorn blossoms
The ploughman whistled over Nutford Place down the green solitudes of
Sovereign Street the merry milkmaid led the lowing kine Here then in
the midst of green fields and sweet airbefore ever omnibuses were
and when Pineapple Turnpike and Terrace were alike unknownhere stood
Tyburn and on the road towards it perhaps to enjoy the prospect
stood in the year 1725 the habitation of Mr John Hayes

One fine morning in the year 1725 Mrs Hayes who had been abroad
in her best hat and ridinghood Mr Hayes who for a wonder had
accompanied her and Mrs Springatt a lodger who for a remuneration
had the honour of sharing Mrs Hayess friendship and table all
returned smiling and rosy at about halfpast ten oclock from a
walk which they had taken to Bayswater Many thousands of people were
likewise seen flocking down the Oxford Road and you would rather
have thought from the smartness of their appearance and the pleasure
depicted in their countenances that they were just issuing from a
sermon than quitting the ceremony which they had been to attend

The fact is that they had just been to see a gentleman hangeda
cheap pleasure which the Hayes family never denied themselves and they
returned home with a good appetite to breakfast braced by the walk and
tickled into hunger as it were by the spectacle I can recollect when
I was a gyp at Cambridge that the men used to have breakfastparties
for the very same purpose and the exhibition of the morning acted
infallibly upon the stomach and caused the young students to eat with
much voracity

Well Mrs Catherine a handsome welldressed plump rosy woman of
three or four and thirty and when my dear is a woman handsomer than
at that age came in quite merrily from her walk and entered the
backparlour which looked into a pleasant yard or garden whereon the
sun was shining very gaily and where at a table covered with a nice
white cloth laid out with some silver mugs too and knives all with
different crests and patterns sat an old gentleman reading in an old
book

Here we are at last Doctor said Mrs Hayes and heres his speech
She produced the little halfpenny tract which to this day is sold at
the gallowsfoot upon the death of every offender Ive seen a many men
turned off to be sure but I never did see one who bore it more like a
man than he did

My dear said the gentleman addressed as Doctor he was as cool and
as brave as steel and no more minded hanging than toothdrawing

It was the drink that ruined him said Mrs Cat

Drink and bad company I warned him my dearI warned him years ago
and directly he got into Wilds gang I knew that he had not a year
to run Ah why my love will men continue such dangerous courses
continued the Doctor with a sigh and jeopardy their lives for a
miserable watch or a snuffbox of which Mr Wild takes threefourths of
the produce But here comes the breakfast and egad I am as hungry as
a lad of twenty

Indeed at this moment Mrs Hayess servant appeared with a smoking dish
of bacon and greens and Mr Hayes himself ascended from the cellar
of which he kept the key bearing with him a tolerably large jug
of smallbeer To this repast the Doctor Mrs Springatt the other
lodger and Mr and Mrs Hayes proceeded with great alacrity A fifth
cover was laid but not used the company remarking that Tom had very
likely found some acquaintances at Tyburn with whom he might choose to
pass the morning

Tom was Master Thomas Billings now of the age of sixteen slim
smart five feet ten inches in height handsome sallow in complexion
blackeyed and blackhaired Mr Billings was apprentice to a tailor of
tolerable practice who was to take him into partnership at the end of
his term It was supposed and with reason that Tom would not fail
to make a fortune in this business of which the present head was one
Beinkleider a German Beinkleider was skilful in his trade after
the manner of his nation which in breeches and metaphysicsin
inexpressibles and incomprehensiblesmay instruct all Europe but too
fond of his pleasure Some promissory notes of his had found their way
into Hayess hands and had given him the means not only of providing
Master Billings with a cheap apprenticeship and a cheap partnership
afterwards but would empower him in one or two years after the young
partner had joined the firm to eject the old one altogether So that
there was every prospect that when Mr Billings was twentyone years
of age poor Beinkleider would have to act not as his master but his
journeyman

Tom was a very precocious youth was supplied by a doting mother with
plenty of pocketmoney and spent it with a number of lively companions
of both sexes at plays bullbaitings fairs jolly parties on the
river and suchlike innocent amusements He could throw a main too as
well as his elders had pinked his man in a row at Madam Kings in the
Piazza and was much respected at the Roundhouse

Mr Hayes was not very fond of this promising young gentleman indeed
he had the baseness to bear malice because in a quarrel which occurred
about two years previously he Hayes being desirous to chastise Mr
Billings had found himself not only quite incompetent but actually at
the mercy of the boy who struck him over the head with a jointstool
felled him to the ground and swore he would have his life The Doctor
who was then also a lodger at Mr Hayess interposed and restored
the combatants not to friendship but to peace Hayes never afterwards
attempted to lift his hand to the young man but contented himself
with hating him profoundly In this sentiment Mr Billings participated
cordially and quite unlike Mr Hayes who never dared to show his
dislike used on every occasion when they met by actions looks words
sneers and curses to let his stepfather know the opinion which he had
of him Why did not Hayes discard the boy altogether Because if he
did so he was really afraid of his life and because he trembled
before Mrs Hayes his lady as the leaf trembles before the tempest in
October His breath was not his own but hers his money too had been
chiefly of her gettingfor though he was as stingy and mean as mortal
man can be and so likely to save much he had not the genius for
GETTING which Mrs Hayes possessed She kept his books for she had
learned to read and write by this time she made his bargains and she
directed the operations of the poorspirited little capitalist When
bills became due and debtors pressed for time then she brought Hayess
own professional merits into play The man was as deaf and cold as a
rock never did poor tradesmen gain a penny from him never were the
bailiffs delayed one single minute from their prey The Beinkleider
business for instance showed pretty well the genius of the two Hayes
was for closing with him at once but his wife saw the vast profits
which might be drawn out of him and arranged the apprenticeship and the
partnership before alluded to The woman heartily scorned and spit upon
her husband who fawned upon her like a spaniel She loved good cheer
she did not want for a certain kind of generosity The only feeling that
Hayes had for anyone except himself was for his wife whom he held in
a cowardly awe and attachment he liked drink too which made
him chirping and merry and accepted willingly any treats that his
acquaintances might offer him but he would suffer agonies when his wife
brought or ordered from the cellar a bottle of wine

And now for the Doctor He was about seventy years of age He had been
much abroad he was of a sober cheerful aspect he dressed handsomely
and quietly in a broad hat and cassock but saw no company except the
few friends whom he met at the coffeehouse He had an income of about
one hundred pounds which he promised to leave to young Billings He was
amused with the lad and fond of his mother and had boarded with them
for some years past The Doctor in fact was our old friend Corporal
Brock the Reverend Doctor Wood now as he had been Major Wood fifteen
years back

Anyone who has read the former part of this history must have seen that
we have spoken throughout with invariable respect of Mr Brock and that
in every circumstance in which he has appeared he has acted not only
with prudence but often with genius The early obstacle to Mr Brocks
success was want of conduct simply Drink women playhow many a brave
fellow have they ruinedhad pulled Brock down as often as his merit
had carried him up When a mans passion for play has brought him to be
a scoundrel it at once ceases to be hurtful to him in a worldly point
of view he cheats and wins It is only for the idle and luxurious
that women retain their fascinations to a very late period and Brocks
passions had been whipped out of him in Virginia where much illhealth
illtreatment hard labour and hard food speedily put an end to them
He forgot there even how to drink rum or wine made this poor declining
gentleman so ill that he could indulge in them no longer and so his
three vices were cured

Had he been ambitious there is little doubt but that Mr Brock on his
return from transportation might have risen in the world but he was
old and a philosopher he did not care about rising Living was cheaper
in those days and interest for money higher when he had amassed about
six hundred pounds he purchased an annuity of seventytwo pounds and
gave outwhy should he notthat he had the capital as well as the
interest After leaving the Hayes family in the country he found them
again in London he took up his abode with them and was attached to the
mother and the son Do you suppose that rascals have not affections
like other people hearts madamay heartsand family ties which they
cherish As the Doctor lived on with this charming family he began to
regret that he had sunk all his money in annuities and could not as he
repeatedly vowed he would leave his savings to his adopted children

He felt an indescribable pleasure suave mari magno etc in watching
the storms and tempests of the Hayes menage He used to encourage Mrs
Catherine into anger when haply that ladys fits of calm would last
too long he used to warm up the disputes between wife and husband
mother and son and enjoy them beyond expression they served him for
daily amusement and he used to laugh until the tears ran down his
venerable cheeks at the accounts which young Tom continually brought
him of his pranks abroad among watchmen and constables at taverns or
elsewhere

When therefore as the party were discussing their bacon and cabbage
before which the Reverend Doctor with much gravity said grace Master
Tom entered Doctor Wood who had before been rather gloomy immediately
brightened up and made a place for Billings between himself and Mrs
Catherine

How do old cock said that young gentleman familiarly How goes it
mother And so saying he seized eagerly upon the jug of beer which Mr
Hayes had drawn and from which the latter was about to help himself
and poured down his throat exactly one quart

Ah said Mr Billings drawing breath after a draught which he had
learned accurately to gauge from the habit of drinking out of pewter
measures which held precisely that quantityAh said Mr Billings
drawing breath and wiping his mouth with his sleeves this is very
thin stuff old Squaretoes but my coppers have been redhot since last
night and they wanted a sluicing

Should you like some ale dear said Mrs Hayes that fond and
judicious parent

A quart of brandy Tom said Doctor Wood Your papa will run down to
the cellar for it in a minute

Ill see him hanged first cried Mr Hayes quite frightened

Oh fie now you unnatural father said the Doctor

The very name of father used to put Mr Hayes in a fury Im not his
father thank Heaven said he

No nor nobody elses said Tom

Mr Hayes only muttered Baseborn brat

His father was a gentlemanthats more than you ever were screamed
Mrs Hayes His father was a man of spirit no cowardly sneak of a
carpenter Mr Hayes Tom has noble blood in his veins for all he has a
tailors appearance and if his mother had had her right she would be
now in a coachandsix

I wish I could find my father said Tom for I think Polly Briggs and
I would look mighty well in a coachandsix Tom fancied that if his
father was a count at the time of his birth he must be a prince now
and indeed went among his companions by the latter august title

Ay Tom that you would cried his mother looking at him fondly

With a sword by my side and a hat and feather theres never a lord at
St Jamess would cut a finer figure

After a little more of this talk in which Mrs Hayes let the company
know her high opinion of her sonwho as usual took care to show
his extreme contempt for his stepfatherthe latter retired to his
occupations the lodger Mrs Springatt who had never said a word all
this time retired to her apartment on the second floor and pulling
out their pipes and tobacco the old gentleman and the young one solaced
themselves with halfanhours more talk and smoking while the thrifty
Mrs Hayes opposite to them was busy with her books

Whats in the confessions said Mr Billings to Doctor Wood There
were six of em besides Mac two for sheep four housebreakers but
nothing of consequence I fancy

Theres the paper said Wood archly Read for yourself Tom

Mr Tom looked at the same time very fierce and very foolish for
though he could drink swear and fight as well as any lad of his inches
in England reading was not among his accomplishments I tell you what
Doctor said he  you have no bantering with mefor Im not the
man that will bear it  me and he threw a tremendous swaggering look
across the table

I want you to learn to read Tommy dear Look at your mother there over
her books she keeps them as neat as a scrivener now and at twenty she
could make never a stroke

Your godfather speaks for your good child and for me thou knowest
that I have promised thee a goldheaded cane and periwig on the first
day that thou canst read me a column of the Flying Post

Hang the periwig said Mr Tom testily Let my godfather read the
paper himself if he has a liking for it

Whereupon the old gentleman put on his spectacles and glanced over
the sheet of whitybrown paper which ornamented with a picture of
a gallows at the top contained the biographies of the seven unlucky
individuals who had that morning suffered the penalty of the law With
the six heroes who came first in the list we have nothing to do but
have before us a copy of the paper containing the life of No 7 and
which the Doctor read in an audible voice

 CAPTAIN MACSHANE

The seventh victim to his own crimes was the famous highwayman Captain
Macshane so well known as the Irish Fireeater

The Captain came to the ground in a fine white lawn shirt and nightcap
and being a Papist in his religion was attended by Father OFlaherty
Popish priest and chaplain to the Bavarian Envoy

Captain Macshane was born of respectable parents in the town of
Clonakilty in Ireland being descended from most of the kings in that
country He had the honour of serving their Majesties King William
and Queen Mary and Her Majesty Queen Anne in Flanders and Spain and
obtained much credit from my Lords Marlborough and Peterborough for his
valour

But being placed on halfpay at the end of the war Ensign Macshane
took to evil courses and frequenting the bagnios and dicehouses was
speedily brought to ruin

Being at this pass he fell in with the notorious Captain Wood and
they two together committed many atrocious robberies in the inland
counties but these being too hot to hold them they went into the west
where they were unknown Here however the day of retribution arrived
for having stolen three pewterpots from a publichouse they under
false names were tried at Exeter and transported for seven years
beyond the sea Thus it is seen that Justice never sleeps but sooner
or latter is sure to overtake the criminal

On their return from Virginia a quarrel about booty arose between
these two and Macshane killed Wood in a combat that took place between
them near to the town of Bristol but a waggon coming up Macshane
was obliged to fly without the illgotten wealth so true is it that
wickedness never prospers

Two days afterwards Macshane met the coach of Miss Macraw a Scotch
lady and heiress going for lumbago and gout to the Bath He at first
would have robbed this lady but such were his arts that he induced
her to marry him and they lived together for seven years in the town of
Eddenboro in Scotlandhe passing under the name of Colonel Geraldine
The lady dying and Macshane having expended all her wealth he was
obliged to resume his former evil courses in order to save himself
from starvation whereupon he robbed a Scotch lord by name the Lord of
Whistlebinkie of a mull of snuff for which crime he was condemned to
the Tolbooth prison at Eddenboro in Scotland and whipped many times in
publick

These deserved punishments did not at all alter Captain Macshanes
disposition and on the 17th of February last he stopped the Bavarian
Envoys coach on Blackheath coming from Dover and robbed his
Excellency and his chaplain taking from the former his money watches
star a furcloak his sword a very valuable one and from the latter
a Romish missal out of which he was then reading and a casebottle

The Bavarian Envoy said Tom parenthetically My master Beinkleider
was his Lordships regimental tailor in Germany and is now making a
Court suit for him It will be a matter of a hundred pounds to him I
warrant

Doctor Wood resumed his reading Humhum A Romish missal out of
which he was reading and a casebottle

By means of the famous Mr Wild this notorious criminal was brought
to justice and the casebottle and missal have been restored to Father
OFlaherty

During his confinement in Newgate Mr Macshane could not be brought to
express any contrition for his crimes except that of having killed his
commanding officer For this Wood he pretended an excessive sorrow
and vowed that usquebaugh had been the cause of his deathindeed in
prison he partook of no other liquor and drunk a bottle of it on the
day before his death

He was visited by several of the clergy and gentry in his cell among
others by the Popish priest whom he had robbed Father OFlaherty
before mentioned who attended him likewise in his last moments if
that idolatrous worship may be called attention and likewise by
the Fathers patron the Bavarian Ambassador his Excellency Count
Maximilian de Galgenstein

As old Wood came to these words he paused to give them utterance

What Max screamed Mrs Hayes letting her inkbottle fall over her
ledgers

Why be hanged if it bent my father said Mr Billings

Your father sure enough unless there be others of his name and
unless the scoundrel is hanged said the Doctorsinking his voice
however at the end of the sentence

Mr Billings broke his pipe in an agony of joy I think well have the
coach now Mother says he and Im blessed if Polly Briggs shall not
look as fine as a duchess

Polly Briggs is a low slut Tom and not fit for the likes of you his
Excellencys son Oh fie You must be a gentleman now sirrah and
I doubt whether I shant take you away from that odious tailors shop
altogether

To this proposition Mr Billings objected altogether for besides Mrs
Briggs before alluded to the young gentleman was much attached to his
masters daughter Mrs Margaret Gretel or Gretchen Beinkleider

No says he There will be time to think of that hereafter maam If
my pa makes a man of me why of course the shop may go to the deuce
for what I care but we had better wait look you for something certain
before we give up such a pretty bird in the hand as this

He speaks like Solomon said the Doctor

I always said he would be a credit to his old mother didnt I Brock
cried Mrs Cat embracing her son very affectionately A credit to her
ay I warrant a real blessing And dost thou want any money Tom for
a lords son must not go about without a few pieces in his pocket And I
tell thee Tommy thou must go and see his Lordship and thou shalt
have a piece of brocade for a waistcoat thou shalt ay and the
silverhilted sword I told thee of but oh Tommy Tommy have a care
and dont be adrawing of it in naughty company at the gaminghouses or
at the

A drawing of fiddlesticks Mother If I go to see my father I must
have a reason for it and instead of going with a sword in my hand I
shall take something else in it

The lad IS a lad of nous cried Doctor Wood although his mother does
spoil him so cruelly Look you Madam Cat did you not hear what he said
about Beinkleider and the clothes Tommy will just wait on the Count
with his Lordships breeches A man may learn a deal of news in the
trying on of a pair of breeches

And so it was agreed that in this manner the son should at first
make his appearance before his father Mrs Cat gave him the piece of
brocade which in the course of the day was fashioned into a smart
waistcoat for Beinkleiders shop was close by in Cavendish Square
Mrs Gretel with many blushes tied a fine blue riband round his neck
and in a pair of silk stockings with gold buckles to his shoes Master
Billings looked a very proper young gentleman

And Tommy said his mother blushing and hesitating should
Maxshould his Lordship ask after yourwant to know if your mother is
alive you can say she is and well and often talks of old times And
Tommy after another pause you neednt say anything about Mr Hayes
only say Im quite well

Mrs Hayes looked at him as he marched down the street a long long way
Tom was proud and gay in his new costume and was not unlike his father
As she looked lo Oxford Street disappeared and she saw a green
common and a village and a little inn There was a soldier leading a
pair of horses about on the green common and in the inn sat a cavalier
so young so merry so beautiful Oh what slim white hands he had and
winning words and tender gentle blue eyes Was it not an honour to
a country lass that such a noble gentleman should look at her for a
moment Had he not some charm about him that she must needs obey when he
whispered in her ear Come follow me As she walked towards the lane
that morning how well she remembered each spot as she passed it and
the look it wore for the last time How the smoke was rising from the
pastures how the fish were jumping and plashing in the millstream
There was the church with all its windows lighted up with gold and
yonder were the reapers sweeping down the brown corn She tried to sing
as she went up the hillwhat was it She could not remember but oh
how well she remembered the sound of the horses hoofs as they came
quicker quickernearer nearer How noble he looked on his great
horse Was he thinking of her or were they all silly words which he
spoke last night merely to pass away the time and deceive poor girls
with Would he remember themwould he

Cat my dear here cried Mr Brock alias Captain alias Doctor Wood
heres the meat agetting cold and I am longing for my breakfast

As they went in he looked her hard in the face What still at it
you silly girl Ive been watching you these five minutes Cat and be
hanged but I think a word from Galgenstein and you would follow him as
a fly does a treaclepot

They went in to breakfast but though there was a hot shoulder of mutton
and onionsauceMrs Catherines favourite dishshe never touched a
morsel of it

In the meanwhile Mr Thomas Billings in his new clothes which his mamma
had given him in his new riband which the fair Miss Beinkleider had
tied round his neck and having his Excellencys breeches wrapped in
a silk handkerchief in his right hand turned down in the direction of
Whitehall where the Bavarian Envoy lodged But before he waited
on him Mr Billings being excessively pleased with his personal
appearance made an early visit to Mrs Briggs who lived in the
neighbourhood of Swallow Street and who after expressing herself with
much enthusiasm regarding her Tommys good looks immediately asked him
what he would stand to drink Raspberry gin being suggested a pint of
that liquor was sent for and so great was the confidence and intimacy
subsisting between these two young people that the reader will be glad
to hear that Mrs Polly accepted every shilling of the money which Tom
Billings had received from his mamma the day before nay could with
difficulty be prevented from seizing upon the cutvelvet breeches which
he was carrying to the nobleman for whom they were made Having paid his
adieux to Mrs Polly Mr Billings departed to visit his father



CHAPTER IX INTERVIEW BETWEEN COUNT GALGENSTEIN AND MASTER THOMAS
BILLINGS WHEN HE INFORMS THE COUNT OF HIS PARENTAGE


I dont know in all this miserable world a more miserable spectacle than
that of a young fellow of five or six and forty The British army that
nursery of valour turns out many of the young fellows I mean who
having flaunted in dragoon uniforms from seventeen to sixandthirty
having bought sold or swapped during that period some two hundred
horses having played say fifteen thousand games at billiards having
drunk some six thousand bottles of wine having consumed a reasonable
number of Nugee coats split many dozen pairs of highheeled Hoby boots
and read the newspaper and the armylist duly retire from the service
when they have attained their eighth lustre and saunter through the
world trailing from London to Cheltenham and from Boulogne to Paris
and from Paris to Baden their idleness their illhealth and their
ennui In the morning of youth and when seen along with whole troops
of their companions these flowers look gaudy and brilliant enough
but there is no object more dismal than one of them alone and in its
autumnal or seedy state My friend Captain Popjoy is one who has
arrived at this condition and whom everybody knows by his title of
Father Pop A kinder simpler more emptyheaded fellow does not exist
He is fortyseven years old and appears a young goodlooking man
of sixty At the time of the Army of Occupation he really was as
goodlooking a man as any in the Dragoons He now uses all sorts of
stratagems to cover the bald place on his head by combing certain
thin grey sidelocks over it He has in revenge a pair of enormous
moustaches which he dyes of the richest blueblack His nose is a good
deal larger and redder than it used to be his eyelids have grown flat
and heavy and a little pair of red watery eyeballs float in the midst
of them it seems as if the light which was once in those sickly green
pupils had extravasated into the white part of the eye If Pops legs
are not so firm and muscular as they used to be in those days when he
took such leaps into Whites buckskins in revenge his waist is much
larger He wears a very good coat however and a waistband which he
lets out after dinner Before ladies he blushes and is as silent as a
schoolboy He calls them modest women His society is chiefly among
young lads belonging to his former profession He knows the best wine
to be had at each tavern or cafe and the waiters treat him with much
respectful familiarity He knows the names of every one of them and
shouts out Send Markwell here or Tell Cuttriss to give us a bottle
of the yellow seal or Dizzy voo Monsure Borrel noo donny shampang
frappy etc He always makes the salad or the punch and dines
out three hundred days in the year the other days you see him in a
twofranc eatinghouse at Paris or prowling about Rupert Street or St
Martins Court where you get a capital cut of meat for eightpence He
has decent lodgings and scrupulously clean linen his animal functions
are still tolerably well preserved his spiritual have evaporated long
since he sleeps well has no conscience believes himself to be a
respectable fellow and is tolerably happy on the days when he is asked
out to dinner

Poor Pop is not very high in the scale of created beings but if you
fancy there is none lower you are in egregious error There was once
a man who had a mysterious exhibition of an animal quite unknown to
naturalists called the wusser Those curious individuals who desired
to see the wusser were introduced into an apartment where appeared
before them nothing more than a little lean shrivelled hideous
bleareyed mangy pig Everyone cried out Swindle and Shame
Patience gentlemen be heasy said the showman look at that there
hanimal its a perfect phenomaly of hugliness I engage you never see
such a pig Nobody ever had seen Now gentlemen said he Ill keep
my promise has per bill and bad as that there pig is look at this
here he showed another Look at this here and youll see at once
that its A WUSSER In like manner the Popjoy breed is bad enough but
it serves only to show off the Galgenstein race which is WUSSER

Galgenstein had led a very gay life as the saying is for the last
fifteen years such a gay one that he had lost all capacity of
enjoyment by this time and only possessed inclinations without
powers of gratifying them He had grown to be exquisitely curious and
fastidious about meat and drink for instance and all that he wanted
was an appetite He carried about with him a French cook who could not
make him eat a doctor who could not make him well a mistress of whom
he was heartily sick after two days a priest who had been a favourite
of the exemplary Dubois and by turns used to tickle him by the
imposition of penance or by the repetition of a tale from the recueil
of Noce or La Fare All his appetites were wasted and worn only some
monstrosity would galvanise them into momentary action He was in that
effete state to which many noblemen of his time had arrived who were
ready to believe in ghostraising or in goldmaking or to retire into
monasteries and wear hairshirts or to dabble in conspiracies or to
die in love with little cookmaids of fifteen or to pine for the smiles
or at the frowns of a prince of the blood or to go mad at the refusal
of a chamberlains key The last gratification he remembered to have
enjoyed was that of riding bareheaded in a soaking rain for three hours
by the side of his Grand Dukes mistresss coach taking the pas of
Count Krahwinkel who challenged him and was run through the body for
this very dispute Galgenstein gained a rheumatic gout by it which put
him to tortures for many months and was further gratified with the post
of English Envoy He had a fortune he asked no salary and could
look the envoy very well Father OFlaherty did all the duties and
furthermore acted as a spy over the ambassadora sinecure post for the
man had no feelings wishes or opinionsabsolutely none

Upon my life father said this worthy man I care for nothing You
have been talking for an hour about the Regents death and the Duchess
of Phalaris and sly old Fleury and what not and I care just as much
as if you told me that one of my bauers at Galgenstein had killed a pig
or as if my lacquey La Rose yonder had made love to my mistress

He does said the reverend gentleman

Ah Monsieur lAbbe said La Rose who was arranging his masters
enormous Court periwig you are helas wrong Monsieur le Comte will
not be angry at my saying that I wish the accusation were true

The Count did not take the slightest notice of La Roses wit but
continued his own complaints

I tell you Abbe I care for nothing I lost a thousand guineas tother
night at basset I wish to my heart I could have been vexed about it
Egad I remember the day when to lose a hundred made me half mad for
a month Well next day I had my revenge at dice and threw thirteen
mains There was some delay a call for fresh bones I think and would
you believe itI fell asleep with the box in my hand

A desperate case indeed said the Abbe

If it had not been for Krahwinkel I should have been a dead man
thats positive That pinking him saved me

I make no doubt of it said the Abbe Had your Excellency not run him
through he without a doubt would have done the same for you

Psha you mistake my words Monsieur lAbbe yawning I meanwhat
cursed chocolatethat I was dying for want of excitement Not that I
cared for dying no d me if I do

WHEN you do your Excellency means said the Abbe a fat greyhaired
Irishman from the Irlandois College at Paris

His Excellency did not laugh nor understand jokes of any kind he was
of an undeviating stupidity and only replied Sir I mean what I say
I dont care for living no nor for dying either but I can speak as
well as another and Ill thank you not to be correcting my phrases as
if I were one of your cursed schoolboys and not a gentleman of fortune
and blood

Herewith the Count who had uttered four sentences about himself he
never spoke of anything else sunk back on his pillows again quite
exhausted by his eloquence The Abbe who had a seat and a table by the
bedside resumed the labours which had brought him into the room in the
morning and busied himself with papers which occasionally he handed
over to his superior for approval

Presently Monsieur la Rose appeared

Here is a person with clothes from Mr Beinkleiders Will your
Excellency see him or shall I bid him leave the clothes

The Count was very much fatigued by this time he had signed three
papers and read the first halfadozen lines of a pair of them

Bid the fellow come in La Rose and hark ye give me my wig one
must show ones self to be a gentleman before these scoundrels And he
therefore mounted a large chestnutcoloured orangescented pyramid of
horsehair which was to awe the newcomer

He was a lad of about seventeen in a smart waistcoat and a blue riband
our friend Tom Billings indeed He carried under his arm the Counts
destined breeches He did not seem in the least awed however by
his Excellencys appearance but looked at him with a great degree of
curiosity and boldness In the same manner he surveyed the chaplain and
then nodded to him with a kind look of recognition

Where have I seen the lad said the father Oh I have it My good
friend you were at the hanging yesterday I think

Mr Billings gave a very significant nod with his head I never miss
said he

What a young Turk And pray sir do you go for pleasure or for
business

Business what do you mean by business

Oh I did not know whether you might be brought up to the trade or
your relations be undergoing the operation

My relations said Mr Billings proudly and staring the Count full
in the face was not made for no such thing Im a tailor now but Im
a gentlemans son as good a man ay as his lordship there for YOU
ant his lordshipyoure the Popish priest you are and we were very
near giving you a touch of a few Protestant stones master

The Count began to be a little amused he was pleased to see the Abbe
look alarmed or even foolish

Egad Abbe said he you turn as white as a sheet

I dont fancy being murdered my Lord said the Abbe hastily
and murdered for a good work It was but to be useful to yonder poor
Irishman who saved me as a prisoner in Flanders when Marlborough would
have hung me up like poor Macshane himself was yesterday

Ah said the Count bursting out with some energy I was thinking who
the fellow could be ever since he robbed me on the Heath I recollect
the scoundrel now he was a second in a duel I had here in the year
six

Along with Major Wood behind Montague House said Mr Billings IVE
heard on it And here he looked more knowing than ever

YOU cried the Count more and more surprised And pray who the devil
ARE you

My names Billings

Billings said the Count

I come out of Warwickshire said Mr Billings

Indeed

I was born at Birmingham town

Were you really

My mothers name was Hayes continued Billings in a solemn voice I
was put out to a nurse along with John Billings a blacksmith and my
father run away NOW do you know who I am

Why upon honour now said the Count who was amusedupon honour
Mr Billings I have not that advantage

Well then my Lord YOURE MY FATHER

Mr Billings when he said this came forward to the Count with a
theatrical air and flinging down the breeches of which he was the
bearer held out his arms and stared having very little doubt but that
his Lordship would forthwith spring out of bed and hug him to his heart
A similar piece of naivete many fathers of families have I have no
doubt remarked in their children who not caring for their parents a
single doit conceive nevertheless that the latter are bound to show
all sorts of affection for them His lordship did move but backwards
towards the wall and began pulling at the bellrope with an expression
of the most intense alarm

Keep back sirrahkeep back Suppose I AM your father do you want
to murder me Good heavens how the boy smells of gin and tobacco Dont
turn away my lad sit down there at a proper distance And La Rose
give him some eaudeCologne and get a cup of coffee Well now go on
with your story Egad my dear Abbe I think it is very likely that what
the lad says is true

If it is a family conversation said the Abbe I had better leave
you

Oh for Heavens sake no I could not stand the boy alone Now Mister
ahWhatsyourname Have the goodness to tell your story

Mr Billings was woefully disconcerted for his mother and he had agreed
that as soon as his father saw him he would be recognised at once and
mayhap made heir to the estates and title in which being disappointed
he very sulkily went on with his narrative and detailed many of those
events with which the reader has already been made acquainted The Count
asked the boys mothers Christian name and being told it his memory
at once returned to him

What are you little Cats son said his Excellency By heavens mon
cher Abbe a charming creature but a tigresspositively a tigress I
recollect the whole affair now Shes a little fresh blackhaired woman
ant she with a sharp nose and thick eyebrows ay Ah yes yes went
on my Lord I recollect her I recollect her It was at Birmingham I
first met her she was my Lady Trippets woman wasnt she

She was no such thing said Mr Billings hotly Her aunt kept the
Bugle Inn on Waltham Green and your Lordship seduced her

Seduced her Oh gad so I did Stap me now I did Yes I made her
jump on my black horse and bore her off likelike Aeneas bore his wife
away from the siege of Rome hey lAbbe

The events were precisely similar said the Abbe It is wonderful
what a memory you have

I was always remarkable for it continued his Excellency Well where
was Iat the black horse Yes at the black horse Well I mounted
her on the black horse and rode her en croupe egadha hato
Birmingham and there we billed and cooed together like a pair of
turtledoves yeshathat we did

And this I suppose is the end of some of the BILLINGS said the
Abbe pointing to Mr Tom

Billings what do you mean Yesohaha pun a calembourg Fi
donc M lAbbe And then after the wont of very stupid people M de
Galgenstein went on to explain to the Abbe his own pun Well but to
proceed cries he We lived together at Birmingham and I was going to
be married to a rich heiress egad when what do you think this little
Cat does She murders me egad and makes me manquer the marriage
Twenty thousand I think it was and I wanted the money in those days
Now wasnt she an abominable monster that mother of yours hey Mr
aWhatsyourname

She served you right said Mr Billings with a great oath starting
up out of all patience

Fellow said his Excellency quite aghast do you know to whom you
speakto a nobleman of seventyeight descents a count of the Holy
Roman Empire a representative of a sovereign Ha egad Dont stamp
fellow if you hope for my protection

Dn your protection said Mr Billings in a fury Curse you and
your protection too Im a freeborn Briton and no  French Papist
And any man who insults my motheray or calls me fellerhad better
look to himself and the two eyes in his head I can tell him And with
this Mr Billings put himself into the most approved attitude of the
Cockpit and invited his father the reverend gentleman and Monsieur
la Rose the valet to engage with him in a pugilistic encounter The two
latter the Abbe especially seemed dreadfully frightened but the Count
now looked on with much interest and giving utterance to a feeble kind
of chuckle which lasted for about half a minute said

Paws off Pompey You young hangdog youegad yes aha pon honour
youre a lad of spirit some of your fathers spunk in you hey I know
him by that oath Why sir when I was sixteen I used to swearto
swear egad like a Thames waterman and exactly in this fellows way
Buss me my lad no kiss my hand That will doand he held out a very
lean yellow hand peering from a pair of yellow ruffles It shook very
much and the shaking made all the rings upon it shine only the more

Well says Mr Billings if you wasnt agoing to abuse me nor
mother I dont care if I shake hands with you I aint proud

The Abbe laughed with great glee and that very evening sent off to his
Court a most ludicrous spicy description of the whole scene of meeting
between this amiable father and child in which he said that young
Billings was the eleve favori of M Kitch Ecuyer le bourreau de
Londres and which made the Dukes mistress laugh so much that she vowed
that the Abbe should have a bishopric on his return for with such
store of wisdom look you my son was the world governed in those days

The Count and his offspring meanwhile conversed with some cordiality
The former informed the latter of all the diseases to which he
was subject his manner of curing them his great consideration as
chamberlain to the Duke of Bavaria how he wore his Court suits and of
a particular powder which he had invented for the hair how when he
was seventeen he had run away with a canoness egad who was afterwards
locked up in a convent and grew to be sixteen stone in weight how
he remembered the time when ladies did not wear patches and how the
Duchess of Marlborough boxed his ears when he was so high because he
wanted to kiss her

All these important anecdotes took some time in the telling and were
accompanied by many profound moral remarks such as I cant abide
garlic nor whitewine stap me nor Sauerkraut though his Highness
eats half a bushel per day I ate it the first time at Court but when
they brought it me a second time I refusedrefused split me and grill
me if I didnt Everybody stared his Highness looked as fierce as
a Turk and that infernal Krahwinkel my dear I did for him
afterwardsthat cursed Krahwinkel I say looked as pleased as
possible and whispered to Countess Fritsch Blitzchen Frau Grafinn
says he its all over with Galgenstein What did I do I had the
entree and demanded it Altesse says I falling on one knee I ate
no kraut at dinner today You remarked it I saw your Highness remark
it

I did M le Comte said his Highness gravely

I had almost tears in my eyes but it was necessary to come to a
resolution you know Sir said I I speak with deep grief to your
Highness who are my benefactor my friend my father but of this I
am resolved I WILL NEVER EAT SAUERKRAUT MORE it dont agree with me
After being laid up for four weeks by the last dish of Sauerkraut of
which I partook I may say with confidenceIT DONT agree with me By
impairing my health it impairs my intellect and weakens my strength
and both I would keep for your Highnesss service

Tut tut said his Highness Tut tut tut Those were his very
words

Give me my sword or my pen said I Give me my sword or my pen
and with these Maximilian de Galgenstein is ready to serve you but
suresure a great prince will pity the weak health of a faithful
subject who does not know how to eat Sauerkraut His Highness was
walking about the room I was still on my knees and stretched forward
my hand to seize his coat

GEHT ZUM TEUFEL Sir said he in a loud voice it means Go to the
deuce my dearGeht zum Teufel and eat what you like With this
he went out of the room abruptly leaving in my hand one of his buttons
which I keep to this day As soon as I was alone amazed by his great
goodness and bounty I sobbed aloudcried like a child the Counts
eyes filled and winked at the very recollection and when I went back
into the cardroom stepping up to Krahwinkel Count says I who
looks foolish nowHey there La Rose give me the diamondYes that
was the very pun I made and very good it was thought Krahwinkel
says I WHO LOOKS FOOLISH NOW and from that day to this I was never
at a Courtday asked to eat SauerkrautNEVER

Hey there La Rose Bring me that diamond snuffbox in the drawer of my
secretaire and the snuffbox was brought Look at it my dear said
the Count for I saw you seemed to doubt There is the buttonthe very
one that came off his Graces coat

Mr Billings received it and twisted it about with a stupid air The
story had quite mystified him for he did not dare yet to think his
father was a foolhis respect for the aristocracy prevented him

When the Counts communications had ceased which they did as soon as
the story of the Sauerkraut was finished a silence of some minutes
ensued Mr Billings was trying to comprehend the circumstances above
narrated his Lordship was exhausted the chaplain had quitted the room
directly the word Sauerkraut was mentionedhe knew what was coming His
Lordship looked for some time at his son who returned the gaze with
his mouth wide open Well said the Countwell sir What are you
sitting there for If you have nothing to say sir you had better go I
had you here to amuse mesplit meand not to sit there staring

Mr Billings rose in a fury

Hark ye my lad said the Count tell La Rose to give thee five
guineas and ahcome again some morning A nice wellgrown young lad
mused the Count as Master Tommy walked wondering out of the apartment
a pretty fellow enough and intelligent too

Well he IS an odd fellow my father thought Mr Billings as he
walked out having received the sum offered to him And he immediately
went to call upon his friend Polly Briggs from whom he had separated in
the morning

What was the result of their interview is not at all necessary to the
progress of this history Having made her however acquainted with the
particulars of his visit to his father he went to his mothers and
related to her all that had occurred

Poor thing she was very differently interested in the issue of it



CHAPTER X SHOWING HOW GALGENSTEIN AND MRS CAT RECOGNISE EACH OTHER IN
MARYLEBONE GARDENSAND HOW THE COUNT DRIVES HER HOME IN HIS CARRIAGE


About a month after the touching conversation above related there was
given at Marylebone Gardens a grand concert and entertainment at
which the celebrated Madame Amenaide a dancer of the theatre at Paris
was to perform under the patronage of several English and foreign
noblemen among whom was his Excellency the Bavarian Envoy Madame
Amenaide was in fact no other than the maitresse en titre of the
Monsieur de Galgenstein who had her a great bargain from the Duke de
RohanChabot at Paris

It is not our purpose to make a great and learned display here
otherwise the costumes of the company assembled at this fete might
afford scope for at least halfadozen pages of fine writing and we
might give if need were specimens of the very songs and music sung on
the occasion Does not the Burney collection of music at the British
Museum afford one an ample store of songs from which to choose
Are there not the memoirs of Colley Cibber those of Mrs Clark the
daughter of Colley Is there not Congreve and Farquharnay and at a
pinch the Dramatic Biography or even the Spectator from which the
observant genius might borrow passages and construct pretty antiquarian
figments Leave we these trifles to meaner souls Our business is not
with the breeches and periwigs with the hoops and patches but with the
divine hearts of men and the passions which agitate them What need
therefore have we to say that on this evening after the dancing the
music and the fireworks Monsieur de Galgenstein felt the strange and
welcome pangs of appetite and was picking a cold chicken along with
some other friends in an arboura cold chicken with an accompaniment
of a bottle of champagnewhen he was led to remark that a very handsome
plump little person in a gorgeous stiff damask gown and petticoat was
sauntering up and down the walk running opposite his suppingplace and
bestowing continual glances towards his Excellency The lady whoever
she was was in a mask such as ladies of high and low fashion wore at
public places in those days and had a male companion He was a lad of
only seventeen marvellously well dressedindeed no other than the
Counts own son Mr Thomas Billings who had at length received from
his mother the silverhilted sword and the wig which that affectionate
parent had promised to him

In the course of the month which had elapsed since the interview that
has been described in the former chapter Mr Billings had several times
had occasion to wait on his father but though he had according to her
wishes frequently alluded to the existence of his mother the Count had
never at any time expressed the slightest wish to renew his acquaintance
with that lady who if she had seen him had only seen him by stealth

The fact is that after Billings had related to her the particulars of
his first meeting with his Excellency which ended like many of the
latter visits in nothing at all Mrs Hayes had found some pressing
business which continually took her to Whitehall and had been prowling
from day to day about Monsieur de Galgensteins lodgings Four or five
times in the week as his Excellency stepped into his coach he might
have remarked had he chosen a woman in a black hood who was looking
most eagerly into his eyes but those eyes had long since left off the
practice of observing and Madam Catherines visits had so far gone for
nothing

On this night however inspired by gaiety and drink the Count had been
amazingly stricken by the gait and ogling of the lady in the mask The
Reverend OFlaherty who was with him and had observed the figure in
the black cloak recognised or thought he recognised her It is the
woman who dogs your Excellency every day said he She is with that
tailor lad who loves to see people hangedyour Excellencys son I
mean And he was just about to warn the Count of a conspiracy evidently
made against him and that the son had brought most likely the mother
to play her arts upon himhe was just about I say to show to the
Count the folly and danger of renewing an old liaison with a woman such
as he had described Mrs Cat to be when his Excellency starting
up and interrupting his ghostly adviser at the very beginning of his
sentence said Egad lAbbe you are rightit IS my son and a mighty
smartlooking creature with him Hey Mr WhatsyournameTom you
rogue dont you know your own father And so saying and cocking his
beaver on one side Monsieur de Galgenstein strutted jauntily after Mr
Billings and the lady

It was the first time that the Count had formally recognised his son

Tom you rogue stopped at this and the Count came up He had a white
velvet suit covered over with stars and orders a neat modest wig and
bag and peachcoloured silkstockings with silver clasps The lady
in the mask gave a start as his Excellency came forward Law mother
dont squeege so said Tom The poor woman was trembling in every limb
but she had presence of mind to squeege Tom a great deal harder and
the latter took the hint I suppose and was silent

The splendid Count came up Ye gods how his embroidery glittered in the
lamps What a royal exhalation of musk and bergamot came from his wig
his handkerchief and his grand lace ruffles and frills A broad yellow
riband passed across his breast and ended at his hip in a shining
diamond crossa diamond cross and a diamond swordhilt Was anything
ever seen so beautiful And might not a poor woman tremble when such
a noble creature drew near to her and deigned from the height of his
rank and splendour to look down upon her As Jove came down to Semele
in state in his habits of ceremony with all the grand cordons of his
orders blazing about his imperial personthus dazzling magnificent
triumphant the great Galgenstein descended towards Mrs Catherine
Her cheeks glowed redhot under her coy velvet mask her heart thumped
against the whalebone prison of her stays What a delicious storm of
vanity was raging in her bosom What a rush of longpent recollections
burst forth at the sound of that enchanting voice

As you wind up a hundredguinea chronometer with a twopenny
watchkeyas by means of a dirty wooden plug you set all the waters of
Versailles araging and splashing and stormingin like manner and by
like humble agents were Mrs Catherines tumultuous passions set going
The Count we have said slipped up to his son and merely saying How
do Tom cut the young gentleman altogether and passing round to the
ladys side said Madam tis a charming eveningegad it is She
almost fainted it was the old voice There he was after seventeen
years once more at her side

Now I know what I could have done I can turn out a quotation from
Sophocles by looking to the index as well as another I can throw off
a bit of fine writing too with passion similes and a moral at the
end What pray is the last sentence but one but the very finest
writing Suppose for example I had made Maximilian as he stood by the
side of Catherine look up towards the clouds and exclaim in the words
of the voluptuous Cornelius Nepos

Or suppose again I had said in a style still more popular

The Count advanced towards the maiden They both were mute for a
while and only the beating of her heart interrupted that thrilling and
passionate silence Ah what years of buried joys and fears hopes and
disappointments arose from their graves in the far past and in those
brief moments flitted before the united ones How sad was that delicious
retrospect and oh how sweet The tears that rolled down the cheek of
each were bubbles from the choked and mossgrown wells of youth the
sigh that heaved each bosom had some lurking odours in itmemories of
the fragrance of boyhood echoes of the hymns of the young heart Thus
is it everfor these blessed recollections the soul always has a place
and while crime perishes and sorrow is forgotten the beautiful alone
is eternal

There now are six columns of the best writing to be found in this
or any other book Galgenstein has quoted Euripides thrice Plato once
Lycophron nine times besides extracts from the Latin syntax and the
minor Greek poets Catherines passionate embreathings are of the most
fashionable order and I call upon the ingenious critic of the X
newspaper to say whether they do not possess the real impress of the
giants of the olden timethe real Platonic smack in a word Not that I
want in the least to show off but it is as well every now and then to
show the public what one CAN do

  There WERE six columns as mentioned by the accurate Mr
 Solomons but we have withdrawn two pages and three
 quarters because although our correspondent has been
 excessively eloquent according to custom we were anxious
 to come to the facts of the story

 Mr Solomons by sending to our office may have the
 cancelled passagesOY

Instead however of all this rant and nonsense how much finer is the
speech that the Count really did make It is a very fine eveningegad
it is The egad did the whole business Mrs Cat was as much in love
with him now as ever she had been and gathering up all her energies
she said It is dreadful hot too I think and with this she made a
curtsey

Stifling split me added his Excellency What do you say madam to
a rest in an arbour and a drink of something cool

Sir said the lady drawing back

Oh a drinka drink by all means exclaimed Mr Billings who was
troubled with a perpetual thirst Come mo Mrs Jones I mean
youre fond of a glass of cold punch you know and the rum here is
prime I can tell you

The lady in the mask consented with some difficulty to the proposal of
Mr Billings and was led by the two gentlemen into an arbour where she
was seated between them and some waxcandles being lighted punch was
brought

She drank one or two glasses very eagerly and so did her two
companions although it was evident to see from the flushed looks of
both of them that they had little need of any such stimulus The Count
in the midst of his champagne it must be said had been amazingly
stricken and scandalised by the appearance of such a youth as Billings
in a public place with a lady under his arm He was the reader will
therefore understand in the moral stage of liquor and when he issued
out it was not merely with the intention of examining Mr Billingss
female companion but of administering to him some sound correction for
venturing at his early period of life to form any such acquaintances
On joining Billings his Excellencys first step was naturally to
examine the lady After they had been sitting for a while over their
punch he bethought him of his original purpose and began to address a
number of moral remarks to his son

We have already given some specimens of Monsieur de Galgensteins sober
conversation and it is hardly necessary to trouble the reader with any
further reports of his speeches They were intolerably stupid and dull
as egotistical as his morning lecture had been and a hundred times
more rambling and prosy If Cat had been in the possession of her sober
senses she would have seen in five minutes that her ancient lover was a
ninny and have left him with scorn but she was under the charm of old
recollections and the sound of that silly voice was to her magical
As for Mr Billings he allowed his Excellency to continue his prattle
only frowning yawning cursing occasionally but drinking continually

So the Count descanted at length upon the enormity of young Billingss
early liaisons and then he told his own in the year four with a
burgomasters daughter at Ratisbon when he was in the Elector of
Bavarias servicethen after Blenheim when he had come over to the
Duke of Marlborough when a physicians wife at Bonn poisoned herself
for him etc etc of a piece with the story of the canoness which has
been recorded before All the tales were true A clever ugly man every
now and then is successful with the ladies but a handsome fool is
irresistible Mrs Cat listened and listened Good heavens she
had heard all these tales before and recollected the place and the
timehow she was hemming a handkerchief for Max who came round and
kissed her vowing that the physicians wife was nothing compared
to herhow he was tired and lying on the sofa just come home from
shooting How handsome he looked Cat thought he was only the handsomer
now and looked more grave and thoughtful the dear fellow

The garden was filled with a vast deal of company of all kinds and
parties were passing every moment before the arbour where our trio sat
About halfanhour after his Excellency had quitted his own box and
party the Rev Mr OFlaherty came discreetly round to examine the
proceedings of his diplomatical chef The lady in the mask was listening
with all her might Mr Billings was drawing figures on the table with
punch and the Count talking incessantly The Father Confessor listened
for a moment and then with something resembling an oath walked away
to the entry of the gardens where his Excellencys gilt coach with
three footmen was waiting to carry him back to London Get me a chair
Joseph said his Reverence who infinitely preferred a seat gratis in
the coach That fool muttered he will not move for this hour The
reverend gentleman knew that when the Count was on the subject of the
physicians wife his discourses were intolerably long and took upon
himself therefore to disappear along with the rest of the Counts
party who procured other conveyances and returned to their homes

After this quiet shadow had passed before the Counts box many groups
of persons passed and repassed and among them was no other than Mrs
Polly Briggs to whom we have been already introduced Mrs Polly was
in company with one or two other ladies and leaning on the arm of a
gentleman with large shoulders and calves a fierce cock to his hat
and a shabby genteel air His name was Mr Moffat and his present
occupation was that of doorkeeper at a gamblinghouse in Covent Garden
where though he saw many thousands pass daily under his eyes his own
salary amounted to no more than fourandsixpence weeklya sum quite
insufficient to maintain him in the rank which he held

Mr Moffat had however received some fundsamounting indeed to a
matter of twelve guineaswithin the last month and was treating Mrs
Briggs very generously to the concert It may be as well to say that
every one of the twelve guineas had come out of Mrs Pollys own pocket
who in return had received them from Mr Billings And as the reader
may remember that on the day of Tommys first interview with his
father he had previously paid a visit to Mrs Briggs having under
his arm a pair of breeches which Mrs Briggs covetedhe should now be
informed that she desired these breeches not for pincushions but for
Mr Moffat who had long been in want of a pair

Having thus episodically narrated Mr Moffats history let us state
that he his lady and their friends passed before the Counts arbour
joining in a melodious chorus to a song which one of the society an
actor of Bettertons was singing

 Tis my will when Im dead that no tear shall be shed
 No Hic jacet be graved on my stone
 But pour oer my ashes a bottle of red
 And say a good fellow is gone
 My brave boys
 And say a good fellow is gone

My brave boys was given with vast emphasis by the party Mr Moffat
growling it in a rich bass and Mrs Briggs in a soaring treble As to
the notes when quavering up to the skies they excited various emotions
among the people in the gardens Silence them blackguards shouted a
barber who was taking a pint of small beer along with his lady Stop
that there infernal screeching said a couple of ladies who were
sipping ratafia in company with two pretty fellows

Dang it its Polly said Mr Tom Billings bolting out of the box
and rushing towards the sweetvoiced Mrs Briggs When he reached her
which he did quickly and made his arrival known by tipping Mrs Briggs
slightly on the waist and suddenly bouncing down before her and her
friend both of the latter drew back somewhat startled

Law Mr Billings says Mrs Polly rather coolly is it you Who
thought of seeing you here

Whos this here young feller says towering Mr Moffat with his bass
voice

Its Mr Billings cousin a friend of mine said Mrs Polly
beseechingly

Oh cousin if its a friend of yours he should know better how to
conduct himself thats all Har you a dancingmaster young feller
that you cut them there capers before gentlemen growled Mr Moffat
who hated Mr Billings for the excellent reason that he lived upon him

Dancingmaster be hanged said Mr Billings with becoming spirit if
you call me dancingmaster Ill pull your nose

What roared Mr Moffat pull my nose MY NOSE Ill tell you what
my lad if you durst move me Ill cut your throat curse me

Oh Moffycousin I meantis a shame to treat the poor boy so Go
away Tommy do go away my cousins in liquor whimpered Madam Briggs
who really thought that the great doorkeeper would put his threat into
execution

Tommy said Mr Moffat frowning horribly Tommy to me too Dog
get out of my ssss SIGHT was the word which Mr Moffat intended to
utter but he was interrupted for to the astonishment of his friends
and himself Mr Billings did actually make a spring at the monsters
nose and caught it so firmly that the latter could not finish his
sentence

The operation was performed with amazing celerity and having concluded
it Mr Billings sprang back and whisked from out its sheath that new
silverhilted sword which his mamma had given him Now said he with
a fierce kind of calmness now for the throatcutting cousin Im your
man

How the brawl might have ended no one can say had the two gentlemen
actually crossed swords but Mrs Polly with a wonderful presence of
mind restored peace by exclaiming Hush hush the beaks the beaks
Upon which with one common instinct the whole party made a rush for
the garden gates and disappeared into the fields Mrs Briggs knew her
company there was something in the very name of a constable which sent
them all aflying

After running a reasonable time Mr Billings stopped But the great
Moffat was nowhere to be seen and Polly Briggs had likewise vanished
Then Tom bethought him that he would go back to his mother but
arriving at the gate of the gardens was refused admittance as he had
not a shilling in his pocket Ive left says Tommy giving himself
the airs of a gentleman some friends in the gardens Im with his
Excellency the Bavarian henvy

Then you had better go away with him said the gate people

But I tell you I left him there in the grand circle with a lady and
whats more in the dark walk I have left a silverhilted sword

Oh my Lord Ill go and tell him then cried one of the porters if
you will wait

Mr Billings seated himself on a post near the gate and there consented
to remain until the return of his messenger The latter went straight
to the dark walk and found the sword sure enough But instead of
returning it to its owner this discourteous knight broke the trenchant
blade at the hilt and flinging the steel away pocketed the baser
silver metal and lurked off by the private door consecrated to the
waiters and fiddlers

In the meantime Mr Billings waited and waited And what was the
conversation of his worthy parents inside the garden I cannot say but
one of the waiters declared that he had served the great foreign Count
with two bowls of rackpunch and some biscuits in No 3 that in the
box with him were first a young gentleman who went away and a lady
splendidly dressed and masked that when the lady and his Lordship were
alone she edged away to the further end of the table and they had much
talk that at last when his Grace had pressed her very much she took
off her mask and said Dont you know me now Max that he cried out
My own Catherine thou art more beautiful than ever and wanted to
kneel down and vow eternal love to her but she begged him not to do so
in a place where all the world would see that then his Highness paid
and they left the gardens the lady putting on her mask again

When they issued from the gardens Ho Joseph la Rose my coach
shouted his Excellency in rather a husky voice and the men who had
been waiting came up with the carriage A young gentleman who was
dosing on one of the posts at the entry woke up suddenly at the blaze
of the torches and the noise of the footmen The Count gave his arm to
the lady in the mask who slipped in and he was whispering La Rose
when the lad who had been sleeping hit his Excellency on the shoulder
and said I say Count you can give ME a cast home too and jumped
into the coach

When Catherine saw her son she threw herself into his arms and kissed
him with a burst of hysterical tears of which Mr Billings was at a
loss to understand the meaning The Count joined them looking not a
little disconcerted and the pair were landed at their own door where
stood Mr Hayes in his nightcap ready to receive them and astounded
at the splendour of the equipage in which his wife returned to him



CHAPTER XI OF SOME DOMESTIC QUARRELS AND THE CONSEQUENCE THEREOF


An ingenious magazinewriter who lived in the time of Mr Brock and the
Duke of Marlborough compared the latter gentlemans conduct in battle
when he

 In peaceful thought the field of death surveyed
 To fainting squadrons lent the timely aid
 Inspired repulsed battalions to engage
 And taught the doubtful battle where to rage

Mr Joseph Addison I say compared the Duke of Marlborough to an angel
who is sent by Divine command to chastise a guilty people

 And pleased his Masters orders to perform
 Rides on the whirlwind and directs the storm

The first four of these novel lines touch off the Dukes disposition
and genius to a tittle He had a love for such scenes of strife in the
midst of them his spirit rose calm and supreme soaring like an
angel or not but anyway the compliment is a very pretty one on the
battleclouds majestic and causing to ebb or to flow the mighty tide of
war

But as this famous simile might apply with equal proprietyto a bad
angel as to a good one it may in like manner be employed to illustrate
small quarrels as well as greata little family squabble in which two
or three people are engaged as well as a vast national dispute argued
on each side by the roaring throats of five hundred angry cannon The
poet means in fact that the Duke of Marlborough had an immense genius
for mischief

Our friend Brock or Wood whose actions we love to illustrate by the
very handsomest similes possessed this genius in common with his
Grace and was never so happy or seen to so much advantage as when he
was employed in setting people by the ears His spirits usually dull
then rose into the utmost gaiety and goodhumour When the doubtful
battle flagged he by his art would instantly restore it When for
instance Toms repulsed battalions of rhetoric fled from his mammas
fire a few words of apt sneer or encouragement on Woods part would
bring the fight round again or when Mr Hayess fainting squadrons of
abuse broke upon the stubborn squares of Toms bristling obstinacy it
was Woods delight to rally the former and bring him once more to the
charge A great share had this man in making those bad people worse
Many fierce words and bad passions many falsehoods and knaveries on
Toms part much bitterness scorn and jealousy on the part of Hayes
and Catherine might be attributed to this hoary old tempter whose
joy and occupation it was to raise and direct the domestic storms and
whirlwinds of the family of which he was a member And do not let us be
accused of an undue propensity to use sounding words because we compare
three scoundrels in the Tyburn Road to so many armies and Mr Wood to
a mighty fieldmarshal My dear sir when you have well studied the
worldhow supremely great the meanest thing in this world is and how
infinitely mean the greatestI am mistaken if you do not make a strange
and proper jumble of the sublime and the ridiculous the lofty and the
low I have looked at the world for my part and come to the conclusion
that I know not which is which

Well then on the night when Mrs Hayes as recorded by us had been to
the Marylebone Gardens Mr Wood had found the sincerest enjoyment in
plying her husband with drink so that when Catherine arrived at home
Mr Hayes came forward to meet her in a manner which showed he was not
only surly but drunk Tom stepped out of the coach first and Hayes
asked him with an oath where he had been The oath Mr Billings
sternly flung back again with another in its company and at the same
time refused to give his stepfather any sort of answer to his query

The old man is drunk mother said he to Mrs Hayes as he handed that
lady out of the coach before leaving which she had to withdraw her hand
rather violently from the grasp of the Count who was inside Hayes
instantly showed the correctness of his surmise by slamming the door
courageously in Toms face when he attempted to enter the house with
his mother And when Mrs Catherine remonstrated according to her wont
in a very angry and supercilious tone Mr Hayes replied with equal
haughtiness and a regular quarrel ensued

People were accustomed in those days to use much more simple and
expressive terms of language than are now thought polite and it would
be dangerous to give in this present year 1840 the exact words of
reproach which passed between Hayes and his wife in 1726 Mr Wood sat
near laughing his sides out Mr Hayes swore that his wife should not
go abroad to teagardens in search of vile Popish noblemen to which
Mrs Hayes replied that Mr Hayes was a pitiful lying sneaking cur
and that she would go where she pleased Mr Hayes rejoined that if she
said much more he would take a stick to her Mr Wood whispered And
serve her right Mrs Hayes thereupon swore she had stood his cowardly
blows once or twice before but that if ever he did so again as sure as
she was born she would stab him Mr Wood said Curse me but I like
her spirit

Mr Hayes took another line of argument and said The neighbours would
talk madam

Ay that they will no doubt said Mr Wood

Then let them said Catherine What do we care about the neighbours
Didnt the neighbours talk when you sent Widow Wilkins to gaol Didnt
the neighbours talk when you levied on poor old Thomson You didnt mind
THEN Mr Hayes

Business maam is business and if I did distrain on Thomson and
lock up Wilkins I think you knew about it as much as I

Ifaith I believe youre a pair said Mr Wood

Pray sir keep your tongue to yourself Your opinion isnt asked
anyhowno nor your company wanted neither cried Mrs Catherine with
proper spirit

At which remark Mr Wood only whistled

I have asked this here gentleman to pass this evening along with me
Weve been drinking together maam

That we have said Mr Wood looking at Mrs Cat with the most perfect
goodhumour

I say maam that weve been adrinking together and when weve been
adrinking together I say that a man is my friend Doctor Wood is my
friend madamthe Reverend Doctor Wood Weve passed the evening in
company talking about politics madampolitics and riddleiddleigion
Weve not been flaunting in teagardens and ogling the men

Its a lie shrieked Mrs Hayes I went with Tomyou know I did the
boy wouldnt let me rest till I promised to go

Hang him I hate him said Mr Hayes hes always in my way

Hes the only friend I have in the world and the only being I care a
pin for said Catherine

Hes an impudent idle goodfornothing scoundrel and I hope to see him
hanged shouted Mr Hayes And pray madam whose carriage was that as
you came home in I warrant you paid something for the rideha ha

Another lie screamed Cat and clutched hold of a supperknife Say
it again John Hayes and by  Ill do for you

Do for me Hang me said Mr Hayes flourishing a stick and perfectly
potvaliant do you think I care for a bastard and a

He did not finish the sentence for the woman ran at him like a savage
knife in hand He bounded back flinging his arms about wildly and
struck her with his staff sharply across the forehead The woman went
down instantly A lucky blow was it for Hayes and her it saved him from
death perhaps and her from murder

All this scenea very important one of our dramamight have been
described at much greater length but in truth the author has a
natural horror of dwelling too long upon such hideous spectacles nor
would the reader be much edified by a full and accurate knowledge of
what took place The quarrel however though not more violent than many
that had previously taken place between Hayes and his wife was about to
cause vast changes in the condition of this unhappy pair

Hayes was at the first moment of his victory very much alarmed
he feared that he had killed the woman and Wood started up rather
anxiously too with the same fancy But she soon began to recover Water
was brought her head was raised and bound up and in a short time
Mrs Catherine gave vent to a copious fit of tears which relieved her
somewhat These did not affect Hayes muchthey rather pleased him for
he saw he had got the better and although Cat fiercely turned upon him
when he made some small attempt towards reconciliation he did not heed
her anger but smiled and winked in a selfsatisfied way at Wood The
coward was quite proud of his victory and finding Catherine asleep or
apparently so when he followed her to bed speedily gave himself up to
slumber too and had some pleasant dreams to his portion

Mr Wood also went sniggering and happy upstairs to his chamber The
quarrel had been a real treat to him it excited the old mantickled
him into goodhumour and he promised himself a rare continuation of
the fun when Tom should be made acquainted with the circumstances of
the dispute As for his Excellency the Count the ride from Marylebone
Gardens and a tender squeeze of the hand which Catherine permitted
to him on parting had so inflamed the passions of the nobleman that
after sleeping for nine hours and taking his chocolate as usual the
next morning he actually delayed to read the newspaper and kept
waiting a toyshop lady from Cornhill with the sweetest bargain of
Mechlin lace in order to discourse to his chaplain on the charms of
Mrs Hayes

She poor thing never closed her lids except when she would have had
Mr Hayes imagine that she slumbered but lay beside him tossing and
tumbling with hot eyes wide open and heart thumping and pulse of a
hundred and ten and heard the heavy hours tolling and at last the day
came peering haggard through the windowcurtains and found her still
wakeful and wretched

Mrs Hayes had never been as we have seen especially fond of her
lord but now as the day made visible to her the sleeping figure and
countenance of that gentleman she looked at him with a contempt and
loathing such as she had never felt even in all the years of her wedded
life Mr Hayes was snoring profoundly by his bedside on his ledger
stood a large greasy tin candlestick containing a lank tallowcandle
turned down in the shaft and in the lower part his keys purse and
tobaccopipe his feet were huddled up in his greasy threadbare clothes
his head and half his sallow face muffled up in a red woollen nightcap
his beard was of several days growth his mouth was wide open and he
was snoring profoundly on a more despicable little creature the sun
never shone And to this sordid wretch was Catherine united for ever
What a pretty rascal history might be read in yonder greasy daybook
which never left the miserhe never read in any other Of what a
treasure were yonder keys and purse the keepers not a shilling they
guarded but was picked from the pocket of necessity plundered from
needy wantonness or pitilessly squeezed from starvation A fool a
miser and a coward Why was I bound to this wretch thought Catherine
I who am highspirited and beautiful did not HE tell me so I
who born a beggar have raised myself to competence and might have
mountedwho knows whitherif cursed Fortune had not baulked me

As Mrs Cat did not utter these sentiments but only thought them we
have a right to clothe her thoughts in the genteelest possible language
and to the best of our power have done so If the reader examines
Mrs Hayess train of reasoning he will not we should think fail
to perceive how ingeniously she managed to fix all the wrong upon her
husband and yet to twist out some consolatory arguments for her
own vanity This perverse argumentation we have all of us no doubt
employed in our time How often have wewe poets politicians
philosophers familymenfound charming excuses for our own
rascalities in the monstrous wickedness of the world about us how
loudly have we abused the times and our neighbours All this devils
logic did Mrs Catherine lying wakeful in her bed on the night of the
Marylebone fete exert in gloomy triumph

It must however be confessed that nothing could be more just than
Mrs Hayess sense of her husbands scoundrelism and meanness for if
we have not proved these in the course of this history we have proved
nothing Mrs Cat had a shrewd observing mind and if she wanted for
proofs against Hayes she had but to look before and about her to find
them This amiable pair were lying in a large walnutbed with faded
silk furniture which had been taken from under a respectable old
invalid widow who had become security for a prodigal son the room was
hung round with an antique tapestry representing Rebecca at the Well
Bathsheba Bathing Judith and Holofernes and other subjects from Holy
Writ which had been many score times sold for fifty pounds and bought
back by Mr Hayes for two in those accommodating bargains which he made
with young gentlemen who received fifty pounds of money and fifty of
tapestry in consideration of their hundredpound bills Against this
tapestry and just cutting off Holoferness head stood an enormous
ominous black clock the spoil of some other usurious transaction Some
chairs and a dismal old black cabinet completed the furniture of this
apartment it wanted but a ghost to render its gloom complete

Mrs Hayes sat up in the bed sternly regarding her husband There is
be sure a strong magnetic influence in wakeful eyes so examining a
sleeping person do not you as a boy remember waking of bright summer
mornings and finding your mother looking over you had not the gaze of
her tender eyes stolen into your senses long before you woke and cast
over your slumbering spirit a sweet spell of peace and love and fresh
springing joy Some such influence had Catherines looks upon her
husband for as he slept under them the man began to writhe about
uneasily and to burrow his head in the pillow and to utter quick
strange moans and cries such as have often jarred ones ear while
watching at the bed of the feverish sleeper It was just upon six and
presently the clock began to utter those dismal grinding sounds which
issue from clocks at such periods and which sound like the deathrattle
of the departing hour Then the bell struck the knell of it and with
this Mr Hayes awoke and looked up and saw Catherine gazing at him

Their eyes met for an instant and Catherine turned away burning red
and looking as if she had been caught in the commission of a crime

A kind of blank terror seized upon old Hayess soul a horrible icy
fear and presentiment of coming evil and yet the woman had but looked
at him He thought rapidly over the occurrences of the last night the
quarrel and the end of it He had often struck her before when angry
and heaped all kinds of bitter words upon her but in the morning she
bore no malice and the previous quarrel was forgotten or at least
passed over Why should the last nights dispute not have the same end
Hayes calculated all this and tried to smile

I hope were friends Cat said he You know I was in liquor last
night and sadly put out by the loss of that fifty pound Theyll ruin
me dearI know they will

Mrs Hayes did not answer

I should like to see the country again dear said he in his most
wheedling way Ive a mind do you know to call in all our money Its
you whove made every farthing of it thats sure and its a matter of
two thousand pound by this time Suppose we go into Warwickshire Cat
and buy a farm and live genteel Shouldnt you like to live a lady in
your own county again How theyd stare at Birmingham hey Cat

And with this Mr Hayes made a motion as if he would seize his wifes
hand but she flung his back again

Coward said she you want liquor to give you courage and then
youve only heart enough to strike women

It was only in selfdefence my dear said Hayes whose courage had
all gone You tried you know toto

To STAB you and I wish I had said Mrs Hayes setting her teeth and
glaring at him like a demon and so saying she sprung out of bed There
was a great stain of blood on her pillow Look at it said she That
bloods of your shedding and at this Hayes fairly began to weep so
utterly downcast and frightened was the miserable man The wretchs
tears only inspired his wife with a still greater rage and loathing she
cared not so much for the blow but she hated the man the man to
whom she was tied for everfor ever The bar between her and wealth
happiness love rank perhaps If I were free thought Mrs Hayes
the thought had been sitting at her pillow all night and whispering
ceaselessly into her ear If I were free Max would marry me I know
he wouldhe said so yesterday

 

As if by a kind of intuition old Wood seemed to read all this womans
thoughts for he said that day with a sneer that he would wager she was
thinking how much better it would be to be a Counts lady than a poor
misers wife And faith said he a Count and a chariotandsix is
better than an old skinflint with a cudgel And then he asked her if
her head was better and supposed that she was used to beating and cut
sundry other jokes which made the poor wretchs wounds of mind and body
feel a thousand times sorer

Tom too was made acquainted with the dispute and swore his accustomed
vengeance against his stepfather Such feelings Wood with a dexterous
malice would never let rest it was his joy at first quite a
disinterested one to goad Catherine and to frighten Hayes though in
truth that unfortunate creature had no occasion for incitements from
without to keep up the dreadful state of terror and depression into
which he had fallen

For from the morning after the quarrel the horrible words and looks
of Catherine never left Hayess memory but a cold fear followed
hima dreadful prescience He strove to overcome this fate as a coward
wouldto kneel to it for compassionto coax and wheedle it into
forgiveness He was slavishly gentle to Catherine and bore her fierce
taunts with mean resignation He trembled before young Billings who was
now established in the house his mother said to protect her against
the violence of her husband and suffered his brutal language and
conduct without venturing to resist

The young man and his mother lorded over the house Hayes hardly dared
to speak in their presence seldom sat with the family except at meals
but slipped away to his chamber he slept apart now from his wife or
passed the evening at the publichouse where he was constrained to
drinkto spend some of his beloved sixpences for drink

And of course the neighbours began to say John Hayes neglects
his wife He tyrannises over her and beats her Always at the
publichouse leaving an honest woman alone at home

The unfortunate wretch did NOT hate his wife He was used to herfond
of her as much as he could be fondsighed to be friends with her
againrepeatedly would creep whimpering to Woods room when the
latter was alone and begged him to bring about a reconciliation They
WERE reconciled as much as ever they could be The woman looked at him
thought what she might be but for him and scorned and loathed him with
a feeling that almost amounted to insanity What nights she lay awake
weeping and cursing herself and him His humility and beseeching looks
only made him more despicable and hateful to her

If Hayes did not hate the mother however he hated the boyhated and
feared him dreadfully He would have poisoned him if he had had the
courage but he dared not he dared not even look at him as he sat
there the master of the house in insolent triumph O God how the
lads brutal laughter rung in Hayess ears and how the stare of his
fierce bold black eyes pursued him Of a truth if Mr Wood loved
mischief as he did honestly and purely for mischiefs sake he had
enough here There was mean malice and fierce scorn and black revenge
and sinful desire boiling up in the hearts of these wretched people
enough to content Mr Woods great master himself

Hayess business as we have said was nominally that of a carpenter
but since for the last few years he had added to it that of a lender
of money the carpenters trade had been neglected altogether for one so
much more profitable Mrs Hayes had exerted herself with much
benefit to her husband in his usurious business She was a resolute
clearsighted keen woman that did not love money but loved to be rich
and push her way in the world She would have nothing to do with the
trade now however and told her husband to manage it himself She felt
that she was separated from him for ever and could no more be brought
to consider her interests as connected with his own

The man was well fitted for the creeping and niggling of his dastardly
trade and gathered his moneys and busied himself with his lawyer and
acted as his own bookkeeper and clerk not without satisfaction His
wifes speculations when they worked in concert used often to frighten
him He never sent out his capital without a pang and only because he
dared not question her superior judgment and will He began now to lend
no more he could not let the money out of his sight His sole pleasure
was to creep up into his room and count and recount it When Billings
came into the house Hayes had taken a room next to that of Wood It was
a protection to him for Wood would often rebuke the lad for using Hayes
ill and both Catherine and Tom treated the old man with deference

At lastit was after he had collected a good deal of his moneyHayes
began to reason with himself Why should I staystay to be insulted
by that boy or murdered by him He is ready for any crime He
determined to fly He would send Catherine money every year Noshe had
the furniture let her let lodgingsthat would support her He would
go and live away abroad in some cheap placeaway from that boy and
his horrible threats The idea of freedom was agreeable to the poor
wretch and he began to wind up his affairs as quickly as he could

Hayes would now allow no one to make his bed or enter his room and
Wood could hear him through the panels fidgeting perpetually to and fro
opening and shutting of chests and clinking of coin At the least sound
he would start up and would go to Billingss door and listen Wood used
to hear him creeping through the passages and returning stealthily to
his own chamber

One day the woman and her son had been angrily taunting him in the
presence of a neighbour The neighbour retired soon and Hayes who had
gone with him to the door heard on returning the voice of Wood in the
parlour The old man laughed in his usual saturnine way and said Have
a care Mrs Cat for if Hayes were to die suddenly by the laws the
neighbours would accuse thee of his death

Hayes started as if he had been shot He too is in the plot thought
he They are all leagued against me they WILL kill me they are only
biding their time Fear seized him and he thought of flying that
instant and leaving all and he stole into his room and gathered his
money together But only a half of it was there in a few weeks all
would have come in He had not the heart to go But that night Wood
heard Hayes pause at HIS door before he went to listen at Mrs
Catherines What is the man thinking of said Wood He is gathering
his money together Has he a hoard yonder unknown to us all

Wood thought he would watch him There was a closet between the two
rooms Wood bored a hole in the panel and peeped through Hayes had a
brace of pistols and four or five little bags before him on the table
One of these he opened and placed one by one fiveandtwenty guineas
into it Such a sum had been due that dayCatherine spoke of it only in
the morning for the debtors name had by chance been mentioned in the
conversation Hayes commonly kept but a few guineas in the house For
what was he amassing all these The next day Wood asked for change
for a twentypound bill Hayes said he had but three guineas And when
asked by Catherine where the money was that was paid the day before
said that it was at the bankers The man is going to fly said Wood
that is sure if he does I know himhe will leave his wife without a
shilling

He watched him for several days regularly two or three more bags were
added to the former number They are pretty things guineas thought
Wood and tell no tales like bankbills And he thought over the days
when he and Macshane used to ride abroad in search of them

I dont know what thoughts entered into Mr Woods brain but the next
day after seeing young Billings to whom he actually made a present of
a guinea that young man in conversing with his mother said Do you
know mother that if you were free and married the Count I should be
a lord Its the German law Mr Wood says and you know he was in them
countries with Marlborough

Ay that he would said Mr Wood in Germany but Germany isnt
England and its no use talking of such things

Hush child said Mrs Hayes quite eagerly how can _I_ marry the
Count Besides ant I married and isnt he too great a lord for me

Too great a lordnot a whit mother If it wasnt for Hayes I might
be a lord now He gave me five guineas only last week but curse the
skinflint who never will part with a shilling

Its not so bad as his striking your mother Tom I had my stick up
and was ready to fell him tother night added Mr Wood And herewith
he smiled and looked steadily in Mrs Catherines face She dared not
look again but she felt that the old man knew a secret that she had
been trying to hide from herself Fool he knew it and Hayes knew it
dimly and never never since that day of the gala had it left her
sleeping or waking When Hayes in his fear had proposed to sleep away
from her she started with joy she had been afraid that she might talk
in her sleep and so let slip her horrible confession

Old Wood knew all her history since the period of the Marylebone fete
He had wormed it out of her day by day he had counselled her how to
act warned her not to yield to procure at least a certain provision
for her son and a handsome settlement for herself if she determined
on quitting her husband The old man looked on the business in a proper
philosophical light told her bluntly that he saw she was bent upon
going off with the Count and bade her take precautions else she might
be left as she had been before

Catherine denied all these charges but she saw the Count daily
notwithstanding and took all the measures which Wood had recommended to
her They were very prudent ones Galgenstein grew hourly more in love
never had he felt such a flame not in the best days of his youth not
for the fairest princess countess or actress from Vienna to Paris

At lengthit was the night after he had seen Hayes counting his
moneybagsold Wood spoke to Mrs Hayes very seriously That husband
of yours Cat said he meditates some treason ay and fancies we are
about such He listens nightly at your door and at mine he is going to
leave you be sure ont and if he leaves you he leaves you to starve

I can be rich elsewhere said Mrs Cat

What with Max

Ay with Max and why not said Mrs Hayes

Why not fool Do you recollect Birmingham Do you think that
Galgenstein who is so tender now because he HASNT won you will be
faithful because he HAS Psha woman men are not made so Dont go to
him until you are sure if you were a widow now he would marry you but
never leave yourself at his mercy if you were to leave your husband to
go to him he would desert you in a fortnight

She might have been a Countess she knew she might but for this cursed
barrier between her and her fortune Wood knew what she was thinking of
and smiled grimly

Besides he continued remember Tom As sure as you leave Hayes
without some security from Max the boys ruined he who might be a
lord if his mother had butPsha never mind that boy will go on
the road as sure as my names Wood Hes a Turpin cock in his eye my
deara regular Tyburn look He knows too many of that sort already
and is too fond of a bottle and a girl to resist and be honest when it
comes to the pinch

Its all true said Mrs Hayes Toms a high mettlesome fellow and
would no more mind a ride on Hounslow Heath than he does a walk now in
the Mall

Do you want him hanged my dear said Wood

Ah Doctor

It IS a pity and thats sure concluded Mr Wood knocking the ashes
out of his pipe and closing this interesting conversation It is a
pity that that old skinflint should be in the way of both your fortunes
and he about to fling you over too

Mrs Catherine retired musing as Mr Billings had previously done a
sweet smile of contentment lighted up the venerable features of Doctor
Wood and he walked abroad into the streets as happy a fellow as any in
London



CHAPTER XII TREATS OF LOVE AND PREPARES FOR DEATH


And to begin this chapter we cannot do better than quote a part of
a letter from M lAbbe OFlaherty to Madame la Comtesse de Xat
Paris

MADAMThe little Arouet de Voltaire who hath come hither to take a
turn in England as I see by the Post of this morning hath brought me
a charming pacquet from your Ladyships hands which ought to render a
reasonable man happy but alas makes your slave miserable I think of
dear Paris and something more dear than all Paris of which Madam
I may not venture to speak furtherI think of dear Paris and find
myself in this dismal Vitehall where when the fog clears up I can
catch a glimpse of muddy Thames and of that fatal palace which the
kings of England have been obliged to exchange for your noble castle of
Saint Germains that stands so stately by silver Seine Truly no bad
bargain For my part I would give my grand ambassadorial saloons
hangings gildings feasts valets ambassadors and all for a bicoque
in sight of the Thuilleries towers or my little cell in the Irlandois

My last sheets have given you a pretty notion of our ambassadors
public doings now for a pretty piece of private scandal respecting
that great man Figure to yourself Madam his Excellency is in love
actually in love talking day and night about a certain fair one whom he
hath picked out of a gutter who is well nigh forty years old who was
his mistress when he was in England a captain of dragoons some sixty
seventy or a hundred years since who hath had a son by him moreover
a sprightly lad apprentice to a tailor of eminence that has the honour
of making his Excellencys breeches

Since one fatal night when he met this fair creature at a certain place
of publique resort called Marylebone Gardens our Cyrus hath been an
altered creature Love hath mastered this brainless ambassador and his
antics afford me food for perpetual mirth He sits now opposite to me at
a table inditing a letter to his Catherine and copying it fromwhat do
you thinkfrom the Grand Cyrus I swear madam that my happiness
would be to offer you this hand as I have my heart long ago and I beg
you to bear in mind this declaration I have just dictated to him the
above tender words for our Envoy I need not tell you is not strong at
writing or thinking

The fair Catherine I must tell you is no less than a carpenters
wife a welltodo bourgeois living at the Tyburn or Gallows Road
She found out her ancient lover very soon after our arrival and hath a
marvellous hankering to be a Counts lady A pretty little creature is
this Madam Catherine Billets breakfasts pretty walks presents of
silks and satins pass daily between the pair but strange to say
the lady is as virtuous as Diana and hath resisted all my Counts
cajoleries hitherto The poor fellow told me with tears in his eyes
that he believed he should have carried her by storm on the very first
night of their meeting but that her son stepped into the way and he or
somebody else hath been in the way ever since Madam will never appear
alone I believe it is this wondrous chastity of the lady that has
elicited this wondrous constancy of the gentleman She is holding out
for a settlement who knows if not for a marriage Her husband she
says is ailing her lover is fool enough and she herself conducts
her negotiations as I must honestly own with a pretty notion of
diplomacy

 

This is the only part of the reverend gentlemans letter that directly
affects this history The rest contains some scandal concerning greater
personages about the Court a great share of abuse of the Elector
of Hanover and a pretty description of a boxingmatch at Mr Figgs
amphitheatre in Oxford Road where John Wells of Edmund Bury as by the
papers may be seen master of the noble science of selfdefence did
engage with Edward Sutton of Gravesend master of the said science and
the issue of the combat

N Badds the Father in a postscriptMonsieur Figue gives a
hat to be cudgelled for before the Master mount and the whole of
this fashionable information hath been given me by Monseigneurs son
Monsieur Billings garcontailleur Chevalier de Galgenstein

Mr Billings was in fact a frequent visitor at the Ambassadors house
to whose presence he by a general order was always admitted As for
the connection between Mrs Catherine and her former admirer the
Abbes history of it is perfectly correct nor can it be said that this
wretched woman whose tale now begins to wear a darker hue was in
anything but SOUL faithless to her husband But she hated him longed
to leave him and loved another the end was coming quickly and every
one of our unknowing actors and actresses were to be implicated more or
less in the catastrophe

It will be seen that Mrs Cat had followed pretty closely the
injunctions of Mr Wood in regard to her dealings with the Count who
grew more heartstricken and tender daily as the completion of his
wishes was delayed and his desires goaded by contradiction The Abbe
has quoted one portion of a letter written by him here is the entire
performance extracted as the holy father said chiefly from the
romance of the Grand Cyrus

 Unhappy Maximilian unto unjust Catherina

MADAMIt must needs be that I love you better than any ever did
since notwithstanding your injustice in calling me perfidious I
love you no less than I did before On the contrary my passion is so
violent and your unjust accusation makes me so sensible of it that
if you did but know the resentments of my soule you would confess your
selfe the most cruell and unjust woman in the world You shall ere
long Madam see me at your feete and as you were my first passion so
you will be my last

On my knees I will tell you at the first handsom opportunity that
the grandure of my passion can only be equalled by your beauty it hath
driven me to such a fatall necessity as that I cannot hide the misery
which you have caused Sure the hostil goddes have to plague me
ordayned that fatal marridge by which you are bound to one so infinitly
below you in degree Were that bond of illomind Hymen cut in twayn
witch binds you I swear Madam that my happiniss woulde be to offer
you this hande as I have my harte long agoe And I praye you to beare
in minde this declaracion which I here sign with my hande and witch I
pray you may one day be called upon to prove the truth on Beleave
me Madam that there is none in the World who doth more honor to your
vertue than myselfe nor who wishes your happinesse with more zeal
thanMAXIMILIAN

From my lodgings in Whitehall this 25th of February

To the incomparable Catherina these with a scarlet satten petticoat

The Count had debated about the sentence promising marriage in event
of Hayess death but the honest Abbe cut these scruples very short by
saying justly that because he wrote in that manner there was no need
for him to act so that he had better not sign and address the note in
full and that he presumed his Excellency was not quite so timid as to
fancy that the woman would follow him all the way to Germany when his
diplomatic duties would be ended as they would soon

The receipt of this billet caused such a flush of joy and exultation to
unhappy happy Mrs Catherine that Wood did not fail to remark it and
speedily learned the contents of the letter Wood had no need to bid the
poor wretch guard it very carefully it never from that day forth left
her it was her title of nobilityher pass to rank wealth happiness
She began to look down on her neighbours her manner to her husband grew
more than ordinarily scornful the poor vain wretch longed to tell her
secret and to take her place openly in the world She a Countess and
Tom a Counts son She felt that she should royally become the title

About this timeand Hayes was very much frightened at the prevalence
of the rumourit suddenly began to be about in his quarter that he was
going to quit the country The story was in everybodys mouth people
used to sneer when he turned pale and wept and passionately denied it

It was said too that Mrs Hayes was not his wife but his
mistresseverybody had this storyhis mistress whom he treated most
cruelly and was about to desert The tale of the blow which had felled
her to the ground was known in all quarters When he declared that the
woman tried to stab him nobody believed him the women said he would
have been served right if she had done so How had these stories gone
abroad Three days more and I WILL fly thought Hayes and the world
may say what it pleases

Ay fool flyaway so swiftly that Fate cannot overtake thee hide so
cunningly that Death shall not find thy place of refuge



CHAPTER XIII BEING A PREPARATION FOR THE END


The reader doubtless doth now partly understand what dark acts of
conspiracy are beginning to gather around Mr Hayes and possibly hath
comprehended

1 That if the rumour was universally credited which declared that Mrs
Catherine was only Hayess mistress and not his wife

She might if she so inclined marry another person and thereby
not injure her fame and excite wonderment but actually add to her
reputation

2 That if all the world did steadfastly believe that Mr Hayes intended
to desert this woman after having cruelly maltreated her

The direction which his journey might take would be of no consequence
and he might go to Highgate to Edinburgh to Constantinople nay down
a well and no soul would care to ask whither he had gone

These points Mr Hayes had not considered duly The latter case had been
put to him and annoyed him as we have seen the former had actually
been pressed upon him by Mrs Hayes herself who in almost the only
communication she had had with him since their last quarrel had asked
him angrily in the presence of Wood and her son whether he had dared
to utter such lies and how it came to pass that the neighbours looked
scornfully at her and avoided her

To this charge Mr Hayes pleaded very meekly that he was not guilty
and young Billings taking him by the collar and clinching his fist in
his face swore a dreadful oath that he would have the life of him if
he dared abuse his mother Mrs Hayes then spoke of the general report
abroad that he was going to desert her which if he attempted to do
Mr Billings vowed that he would follow him to Jerusalem and have his
blood These threats and the insolent language of young Billings
rather calmed Hayes than agitated him he longed to be on his journey
but he began to hope that no obstacle would be placed in the way of
it For the first time since many days he began to enjoy a feeling
something akin to security and could look with tolerable confidence
towards a comfortable completion of his own schemes of treason

These points being duly settled we are now arrived O public at a
point for which the authors soul hath been yearning ever since this
history commenced We are now come O critic to a stage of the work
when this tale begins to assume an appearance so interestingly horrific
that you must have a heart of stone if you are not interested by it
O candid and discerning reader who art sick of the hideous scenes of
brutal bloodshed which have of late come forth from pens of certain
eminent wits if you turn away disgusted from the book remember that
this passage hath not been written for you or such as you who have
taste to know and hate the style in which it hath been composed but
for the public which hath no such tastefor the public which can
patronise four different representations of Jack Sheppardfor the
public whom its literary providers have gorged with blood and foul
Newgate garbageand to whom we poor creatures humbly following at
the tail of our great highpriests and prophets of the press may as in
duty bound offer some small gift of our own a little mite truly
but given with goodwill Come up then fair Catherine and brave
Countappear gallant Brock and faultless Billingshasten hither
honest John Hayes the former chapters are but flowers in which we have
been decking you for the sacrifice Ascend to the altar ye innocent
lambs and prepare for the final act lo the knife is sharpened and
the sacrificer ready Stretch your throats sweet onesfor the public
is thirsty and must have blood

  This was written in 1840



CHAPTER THE LAST


That Mr Hayes had some notion of the attachment of Monsieur de
Galgenstein for his wife is very certain the man could not but perceive
that she was more gaily dressed and more frequently absent than usual
and must have been quite aware that from the day of the quarrel until
the present period Catherine had never asked him for a shilling for the
house expenses He had not the heart to offer however nor in truth
did she seem to remember that money was due

She received in fact many sums from the tender Count Tom was likewise
liberally provided by the same personage who was moreover continually
sending presents of various kinds to the person on whom his affections
were centred

One of these gifts was a hamper of choice mountainwine which had been
some weeks in the house and excited the longing of Mr Hayes who loved
wine very much This liquor was generally drunk by Wood and Billings
who applauded it greatly and many times in passing through the
backparlourwhich he had to traverse in order to reach the stair
Hayes had cast a tender eye towards the drink of which had he dared
he would have partaken

On the 1st of March in the year 1726 Mr Hayes had gathered together
almost the whole sum with which he intended to decamp and having on
that very day recovered the amount of a bill which he thought almost
hopeless he returned home in tolerable goodhumour and feeling so
near was his period of departure something like security Nobody had
attempted the least violence on him besides he was armed with pistols
had his money in bills in a belt about his person and really reasoned
with himself that there was no danger for him to apprehend

He entered the house about dusk at five oclock Mrs Hayes was absent
with Mr Billings only Mr Wood was smoking according to his wont
in the little backparlour and as Mr Hayes passed the old gentleman
addressed him in a friendly voice and wondering that he had been such
a stranger invited him to sit and take a glass of wine There was a
light and a foreman in the shop Mr Hayes gave his injunctions to that
person and saw no objection to Mr Woods invitation

The conversation at first a little stiff between the two gentlemen
began speedily to grow more easy and confidential and so particularly
bland and goodhumoured was Mr or Doctor Wood that his companion
was quite caught and softened by the charm of his manner and the pair
became as good friends as in the former days of their intercourse

I wish you would come down sometimes of evenings quoth Doctor Wood
for though no booklearned man Mr Hayes look you you are a man
of the world and I cant abide the society of boys Theres Tom now
since this tiff with Mrs Cat the scoundrel plays the Grank Turk here
The pair of em betwixt them have completely gotten the upper hand of
you Confess that you are beaten Master Hayes and dont like the boy

No more I do said Hayes and thats the truth ont A man doth not
like to have his wifes sins flung in his face nor to be perpetually
bullied in his own house by such a fiery sprig as that

Mischief sirmischief only said Wood tis the fun of youth sir
and will go off as age comes to the lad Bad as you may think himand
he is as skittish and fierce sure enough as a young coltthere is
good stuff in him and though he hath or fancies he hath the right to
abuse every one by the Lord he will let none others do so Last week
now didnt he tell Mrs Cat that you served her right in the last
beating matter and werent they coming to knives just as in your case
By my faith they were Ay and at the Braunds Head when some fellow
said that you were a bloody Bluebeard and would murder your wife
stab me if Tom wasnt up in an instant and knocked the fellow down for
abusing of you

The first of these stories was quite true the second was only a
charitable invention of Mr Wood and employed doubtless for the
amiable purpose of bringing the old and young men together The scheme
partially succeeded for though Hayes was not so far mollified towards
Tom as to entertain any affection for a young man whom he had cordially
detested ever since he knew him yet he felt more at ease and cheerful
regarding himself and surely not without reason While indulging in
these benevolent sentiments Mrs Catherine and her son arrived
and found somewhat to their astonishment Mr Hayes seated in the
backparlour as in former times and they were invited by Mr Wood to
sit down and drink

We have said that certain bottles of mountainwine were presented by the
Count to Mrs Catherine these were at Mr Woods suggestion produced
and Hayes who had long been coveting them was charmed to have an
opportunity to drink his fill He forthwith began bragging of his
great powers as a drinker and vowed that he could manage eight bottles
without becoming intoxicated

Mr Wood grinned strangely and looked in a peculiar way at Tom
Billings who grinned too Mrs Cats eyes were turned towards the
ground but her face was deadly pale

The party began drinking Hayes kept up his reputation as a toper and
swallowed one two three bottles without wincing He grew talkative and
merry and began to sing songs and to cut jokes at which Wood laughed
hugely and Billings after him Mrs Cat could not laugh but sat
silent

What ailed her Was she thinking of the Count She had been with Max
that day and had promised him for the next night at ten an interview
near his lodgings at Whitehall It was the first time that she would
see him alone They were to meet not a very cheerful place for a
lovetryst at St Margarets churchyard near Westminster Abbey Of
this no doubt Cat was thinking but what could she mean by whispering
to Wood No no for Gods sake not tonight

She means we are to have no more liquor said Wood to Mr Hayes who
heard this sentence and seemed rather alarmed

Thats itno more liquor said Catherine eagerly you have had
enough tonight Go to bed and lock your door and sleep Mr Hayes

But I say Ive NOT had enough drink screamed Hayes Im good for
five bottles more and wager I will drink them too

Done for a guinea said Wood

Done and done said Billings

Be YOU quiet growled Hayes scowling at the lad I will drink what
I please and ask no counsel of yours And he muttered some more curses
against young Billings which showed what his feelings were towards his
wifes son and which the latter for a wonder only received with a
scornful smile and a knowing look at Wood

Well the five extra bottles were brought and drunk by Mr Hayes
and seasoned by many songs from the recueil of Mr Thomas dUrfey and
others The chief part of the talk and merriment was on Hayess part
as indeed was naturalfor while he drank bottle after bottle of
wine the other two gentlemen confined themselves to small beerboth
pleading illness as an excuse for their sobriety

And now might we depict with much accuracy the course of Mr Hayess
intoxication as it rose from the merriment of the threebottle point
to the madness of the fourfrom the uproarious quarrelsomeness of the
sixth bottle to the sickly stupidity of the seventh but we are
desirous of bringing this tale to a conclusion and must pretermit
all consideration of a subject so curious so instructive and so
delightful Suffice it to say as a matter of history that Mr Hayes
did actually drink seven bottles of mountainwine and that Mr Thomas
Billings went to the Braunds Head in Bond Street and purchased
another which Hayes likewise drank

Thatll do said Mr Wood to young Billings and they led Hayes up to
bed whither in truth he was unable to walk himself

 

Mrs Springatt the lodger came down to ask what the noise was Tis
only Tom Billings making merry with some friends from the country
answered Mrs Hayes whereupon Springatt retired and the house was
quiet

 

Some scuffling and stamping was heard about eleven oclock

 

After they had seen Mr Hayes to bed Billings remembered that he had a
parcel to carry to some person in the neighbourhood of the Strand
and as the night was remarkably fine he and Mr Wood agreed to walk
together and set forth accordingly

Here follows a description of the THAMES AT MIDNIGHT in a fine
historical style with an account of Lambeth Westminster the Savoy
Baynards Castle Arundel House the Temple of Old London Bridge
with its twenty arches on which be houses builded so that it seemeth
rather a continuall street than a bridgeof Bankside and the Globe
and the Fortune Theatres of the ferries across the river and of the
pirates who infest the samenamely tinklermen petermen hebbermen
trawlermen of the fleet of barges that lay at the Savoy steps and of
the long lines of slim wherries sleeping on the river banks and basking
and shining in the moonbeams A combat on the river is described
that takes place between the crews of a tinklermans boat and the
waterbailiffs Shouting his warcry St Mary Overy a la rescousse
the waterbailiff sprung at the throat of the tinklerman captain The
crews of both vessels as if aware that the struggle of their chiefs
would decide the contest ceased hostilities and awaited on their
respective poops the issue of the deathshock It was not long
coming Yield dog said the waterbailiff The tinklerman could not
answerfor his throat was grasped too tight in the iron clench of the
city champion but drawing his snickersnee he plunged it seven times in
the bailiffs chest still the latter fell not The deathrattle gurgled
in the throat of his opponent his arms fell heavily to his side
Foot to foot each standing at the side of his boat stood the brave
menTHEY WERE BOTH DEAD In the name of St Clement Danes said the
master give way my men and thrusting forward his halberd seven
feet long richly decorated with velvet and brass nails and having
the city arms argent a cross gules and in the first quarter a dagger
displayed of the second he thrust the tinklermans boat away from his
own and at once the bodies of the captains plunged down down down
down in the unfathomable waters

After this follows another episode Two masked ladies quarrel at the
door of a tavern overlooking the Thames they turn out to be Stella and
Vanessa who have followed Swift thither who is in the act of reading
Gullivers Travels to Gay Arbuthnot Bolingbroke and Pope Two
fellows are sitting shuddering under a doorway to one of them Tom
Billings flung a sixpence He little knew that the names of those two
young men wereSamuel Johnson and Richard Savage




ANOTHER LAST CHAPTER


Mr Hayes did not join the family the next day and it appears that
the previous nights reconciliation was not very durable for when Mrs
Springatt asked Wood for Hayes Mr Wood stated that Hayes had gone away
without saying whither he was bound or how long he might be absent
He only said in rather a sulky tone that he should probably pass the
night at a friends house For my part I know of no friend he hath
added Mr Wood and pray Heaven that he may not think of deserting his
poor wife whom he hath beaten and illused so already In this prayer
Mrs Springatt joined and so these two worthy people parted

What business Billings was about cannot be said but he was this night
bound towards Marylebone Fields as he was the night before for the
Strand and Westminster and although the night was very stormy and
rainy as the previous evening had been fine old Wood goodnaturedly
resolved upon accompanying him and forth they sallied together

Mrs Catherine too had HER business as we have seen but this was of
a very delicate nature At nine oclock she had an appointment with
the Count and faithfully by that hour had found her way to Saint
Margarets churchyard near Westminster Abbey where she awaited
Monsieur de Galgenstein

The spot was convenient being very lonely and at the same time close
to the Counts lodgings at Whitehall His Excellency came but somewhat
after the hour for to say the truth being a freethinker he had
the most firm belief in ghosts and demons and did not care to pace
a churchyard alone He was comforted therefore when he saw a woman
muffled in a cloak who held out her hand to him at the gate and said
Is that you He took her handit was very clammy and cold and at
her desire he bade his confidential footman who had attended him with a
torch to retire and leave him to himself

The torchbearer retired and left them quite in darkness and the pair
entered the little cemetery cautiously threading their way among the
tombs They sat down on one underneath a tree it seemed to be the wind
was very cold and its piteous howling was the only noise that broke
the silence of the place Catherines teeth were chattering for all her
wraps and when Max drew her close to him and encircled her waist with
one arm and pressed her hand she did not repulse him but rather
came close to him and with her own damp fingers feebly returned his
pressure

The poor thing was very wretched and weeping She confided to Max the
cause of her grief She was alone in the worldalone and penniless
Her husband had left her she had that very day received a letter from
him which confirmed all that she had suspected so long He had left her
carried away all his property and would not return

If we say that a selfish joy filled the breast of Monsieur de
Galgenstein the reader will not be astonished A heartless libertine
he felt glad at the prospect of Catherines ruin for he hoped that
necessity would make her his own He clasped the poor thing to his
heart and vowed that he would replace the husband she had lost and
that his fortune should be hers

Will you replace him said she

Yes truly in everything but the name dear Catherine and when he
dies I swear you shall be Countess of Galgenstein

Will you swear she cried eagerly

By everything that is most sacred were you free now I would and
here he swore a terrific oath at once make you mine

We have seen before that it cost Monsieur de Galgenstein nothing to
make these vows Hayes was likely too to live as long as Catherineas
long at least as the Counts connection with her but he was caught in
his own snare

She took his hand and kissed it repeatedly and bathed it in her tears
and pressed it to her bosom Max she said I AM FREE Be mine and I
will love you as I have done for years and years

Max started back What is he dead he said

No no not dead but he never was my husband

He let go her hand and interrupting her said sharply Indeed madam
if this carpenter never was your husband I see no cause why _I_
should be If a lady who hath been for twenty years the mistress of a
miserable country boor cannot find it in her heart to put up with the
protection of a noblemana sovereigns representativeshe may seek a
husband elsewhere

I was no mans mistress except yours sobbed Catherine wringing her
hands and sobbing wildly but O Heaven I deserved this Because I was
a child and you saw and ruined and left mebecause in my sorrow and
repentance I wished to repair my crime and was touched by that mans
love and married himbecause he too deceives and leaves mebecause
after loving youmadly loving you for twenty yearsI will not now
forfeit your respect and degrade myself by yielding to your will you
too must scorn me It is too muchtoo muchO Heaven And the wretched
woman fell back almost fainting

Max was almost frightened by this burst of sorrow on her part and was
coming forward to support her but she motioned him away and taking
from her bosom a letter said If it were light you could see Max
how cruelly I have been betrayed by that man who called himself my
husband Long before he married me he was married to another This
woman is still living he says and he says he leaves me for ever

At this moment the moon which had been hidden behind Westminster Abbey
rose above the vast black mass of that edifice and poured a flood of
silver light upon the little church of St Margarets and the spot
where the lovers stood Max was at a little distance from Catherine
pacing gloomily up and down the flags She remained at her old position
at the tombstone under the tree or pillar as it seemed to be as the
moon got up She was leaning against the pillar and holding out to Max
with an arm beautifully white and rounded the letter she had received
from her husband Read it Max she said I asked for light and here
is Heavens own by which you may read

But Max did not come forward to receive it On a sudden his face assumed
a look of the most dreadful surprise and agony He stood still and
stared with wild eyes starting from their sockets he stared upwards
at a point seemingly above Catherines head At last he raised up his
finger slowly and said Look CatTHE HEADTHE HEAD Then uttering a
horrible laugh he fell down grovelling among the stones gibbering and
writhing in a fit of epilepsy

Catherine started forward and looked up She had been standing against a
post not a treethe moon was shining full on it now and on the summit
strangely distinct and smiling ghastly was a livid human head

The wretched woman fledshe dared look no more And some hours
afterwards when alarmed by the Counts continued absence his
confidential servant came back to seek for him in the churchyard he was
found sitting on the flags staring full at the head and laughing
and talking to it wildly and nodding at it He was taken up a hopeless
idiot and so lived for years and years clanking the chain and moaning
under the lash and howling through long nights when the moon peered
through the bars of his solitary cell and he buried his face in the
straw

 

Therethe murder is out And having indulged himself in a chapter of
the very finest writing the author begs the attention of the British
public towards it humbly conceiving that it possesses some of those
peculiar merits which have rendered the fine writing in other chapters
of the works of other authors so famous

Without bragging at all let us just point out the chief claims of the
above pleasing piece of composition In the first place it is perfectly
stilted and unnatural the dialogue and the sentiments being artfully
arranged so as to be as strong and majestic as possible Our dear Cat
is but a poor illiterate country wench who has come from cutting her
husbands throat and yet see she talks and looks like a tragedy
princess who is suffering in the most virtuous blank verse This is the
proper end of fiction and one of the greatest triumphs that a novelist
can achieve for to make people sympathise with virtue is a vulgar trick
that any common fellow can do but it is not everybody who can take a
scoundrel and cause us to weep and whimper over him as though he were
a very saint Give a young lady of five years old a skein of silk and
a brace of nettingneedles and she will in a short time turn you out
a decent silk purseanybody can but try her with a sows ear and see
whether she can make a silk purse out of THAT That is the work for your
real great artist and pleasant it is to see how many have succeeded in
these latter days

The subject is strictly historical as anyone may see by referring to
the Daily Post of March 3 1726 which contains the following paragraph

Yesterday morning early a mans head that by the freshness of it
seemed to have been newly cut off from the body having its own hair
on was found by the rivers side near Millbank Westminster and was
afterwards exposed to public view in St Margarets churchyard where
thousands of people have seen it but none could tell who the unhappy
person was much less who committed such a horrid and barbarous action
There are various conjectures relating to the deceased but there being
nothing certain we omit them The head was much hacked and mangled in
the cutting off

The head which caused such an impression upon Monsieur de Galgenstein
was indeed once on the shoulders of Mr John Hayes who lost it under
the following circumstances We have seen how Mr Hayes was induced
to drink Mr Hayes having been encouraged in drinking the wine and
growing very merry therewith he sang and danced about the room but his
wife fearing the quantity he had drunk would not have the wishedfor
effect on him she sent away for another bottle of which he drank
also This effectually answered their expectations and Mr Hayes became
thereby intoxicated and deprived of his understanding

He however made shift to get into the other room and throwing
himself upon the bed fell asleep upon which Mrs Hayes reminded them
of the affair in hand and told them that was the most proper juncture
to finish the business 

 

  The description of the murder and the execution of the
 culprits which here follows in the original was taken from
 the newspapers of the day Coming from such a source they
 have as may be imagined no literary merit whatever The
 details of the crime are simply horrible without one touch
 of even that sort of romance which sometimes gives a little
 dignity to murder As such they precisely suited Mr
 Thackerays purpose at the timewhich was to show the real
 manners and customs of the Sheppards and Turpins who were
 then the popular heroes of fiction But nowadays there is
 no such purpose to serve and therefore these too literal
 details are omitted

 


Ring ding ding the gloomy green curtain drops the dramatis personae
are duly disposed of the nimble candle snuffers put out the lights and
the audience goeth pondering home If the critic take the pains to ask
why the author who hath been so diffuse in describing the early and
fabulous acts of Mrs Catherines existence should so hurry off the
catastrophe where a deal of the very finest writing might have been
employed Solomons replies that the ordinary narrative is far
more emphatic than any composition of his own could be with all the
rhetorical graces which he might employ Mr Arams trial as taken by
the pennyaliners of those days had always interested him more than
the lengthened and poetical report which an eminent novelist has given
of the same Mr Turpins adventures are more instructive and agreeable
to him in the account of the Newgate Plutarch than in the learned
Ainsworths Biographical Dictionary And as he believes that the
professional gentlemen who are employed to invest such heroes with the
rewards that their great actions merit will go through the ceremony of
the grand cordon with much more accuracy and despatch than can be shown
by the most distinguished amateur in like manner he thinks that the
history of such investitures should be written by people directly
concerned and not by admiring persons without who must be ignorant of
many of the secrets of Ketchcraft We very much doubt if Milton himself
could make a description of an execution half so horrible as the simple
lines in the Daily Post of a hundred and ten years since that now lies
before usherrlich wie am ersten Tagas bright and clean as on
the day of publication Think of it it has been read by Belinda at her
toilet scanned at Buttons and Wills sneered at by wits talked
of in palaces and cottages by a busy race in wigs red heels hoops
patches and rags of all varietya busy race that hath long since
plunged and vanished in the unfathomable gulf towards which we march so
briskly

Where are they Afflavit Deusand they are gone Hark is not the
same wind roaring still that shall sweep us down and yonder stands the
compositor at his types who shall put up a pretty paragraph some day to
say how Yesterday at his house in Grosvenor Square or At Botany
Bay universally regretted died SoandSo Into what profound
moralities is the paragraph concerning Mrs Catherines burning leading
us

Ay truly and to that very point have we wished to come for having
finished our delectable meal it behoves us to say a word or two by way
of grace at its conclusion and be heartily thankful that it is over It
has been the writers object carefully to exclude from his drama except
in two very insignificant instancesmere walkinggentlemen parts any
characters but those of scoundrels of the very highest degree That he
has not altogether failed in the object he had in view is evident from
some newspaper critiques which he has had the good fortune to see and
which abuse the tale of Catherine as one of the dullest most vulgar
and immoral works extant It is highly gratifying to the author to find
that such opinions are abroad as they convince him that the taste for
Newgate literature is on the wane and that when the public critic has
right down undisguised immorality set before him the honest creature is
shocked at it as he should be and can declare his indignation in good
round terms of abuse The characters of the tale ARE immoral and no
doubt of it but the writer humbly hopes the end is not so The public
was in our notion dosed and poisoned by the prevailing style of
literary practice and it was necessary to administer some medicine
that would produce a wholesome nausea and afterwards bring about a more
healthy habit

And thank Heaven this effect HAS been produced in very many instances
and that the Catherine cathartic has acted most efficaciously The
author has been pleased at the disgust which his work has excited and
has watched with benevolent carefulness the wry faces that have been
made by many of the patients who have swallowed the dose Solomons
remembers at the establishment in Birchin Lane where he had the honour
of receiving his education there used to be administered to the boys a
certain coughmedicine which was so excessively agreeable that all the
lads longed to have colds in order to partake of the remedy Some of our
popular novelists have compounded their drugs in a similar way and
made them so palatable that a public once healthy and honest has been
wellnigh poisoned by their wares Solomons defies anyone to say the
like of himselfthat his doses have been as pleasant as champagne and
his pills as sweet as barleysugarit has been his attempt to make
vice to appear entirely vicious and in those instances where he hath
occasionally introduced something like virtue to make the sham as
evident as possible and not allow the meanest capacity a single chance
to mistake it

And what has been the consequence That wholesome nausea which it has
been his good fortune to create wherever he has been allowed to practise
in his humble circle

Has anyone thrown away a halfpennyworth of sympathy upon any person
mentioned in this history Surely no But abler and more famous men than
Solomons have taken a different plan and it becomes every man in his
vocation to cry out against such and expose their errors as best he
may

Labouring under such ideas Mr Isaac Solomons junior produced the
romance of Mrs Cat and confesses himself completely happy to have
brought it to a conclusion His poem may be dullay and probably
is The great Blackmore the great Dennis the great Sprat the great
Pomfret not to mention great men of our own timehave they not also
been dull and had pretty reputations too Be it granted Solomons IS
dull but dont attack his morality he humbly submits that in his
poem no man shall mistake virtue for vice no man shall allow a single
sentiment of pity or admiration to enter his bosom for any character of
the piece it being from beginning to end a scene of unmixed rascality
performed by persons who never deviate into good feeling And although
he doth not pretend to equal the great modern authors whom he hath
mentioned in wit or descriptive power yet in the point of moral he
meekly believes that he has been their superior feeling the greatest
disgust for the characters he describes and using his humble endeavour
to cause the public also to hate them
