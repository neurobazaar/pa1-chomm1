Introduction


About This File


This document is a collection of slang terms used by various subcultures
of computer hackers Though some technical material is included for
background and flavor it is not a technical dictionary what we
describe here is the language hackers use among themselves for fun
social communication and technical debate

The hacker culture is actually a loosely networked collection of
subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important shared
experiences shared roots and shared values It has its own myths
heroes villains folk epics injokes taboos and dreams Because
hackers as a group are particularly creative people who define
themselves partly by rejection of normal values and working habits it
has unusually rich and conscious traditions for an intentional culture
less than 35 years old

As usual with slang the special vocabulary of hackers helps hold their
culture together  it helps hackers recognize each others places in
the community and expresses shared values and experiences Also as
usual not knowing the slang or using it inappropriately defines one
as an outsider a mundane or worst of all in hackish vocabulary
possibly even a suit All human cultures use slang in this threefold
way  as a tool of communication and of inclusion and of exclusion

Among hackers though slang has a subtler aspect paralleled perhaps in
the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but hard to
detect in most technical or scientific cultures parts of it are code
for shared states of consciousness There is a whole range of altered
states and problemsolving mental stances basic to highlevel hacking
which dont fit into conventional linguistic reality any better than a
Coltrane solo or one of Maurits Eschers trompe loeil compositions
Escher is a favorite of hackers and hacker slang encodes these
subtleties in many unobvious ways As a simple example take the
distinction between a kluge and an elegant solution and the
differing connotations attached to each The distinction is not only of
engineering significance it reaches right back into the nature of the
generative processes in program design and asserts something important
about two different kinds of relationship between the hacker and the
hack Hacker slang is unusually rich in implications of this kind of
overtones and undertones that illuminate the hackish psyche

But there is more Hackers as a rule love wordplay and are very
conscious and inventive in their use of language These traits seem to
be common in young children but the conformityenforcing machine we are
pleased to call an educational system bludgeons them out of most of us
before adolescence Thus linguistic invention in most subcultures of
the modern West is a halting and largely unconscious process Hackers
by contrast regard slang formation and use as a game to be played for
conscious pleasure Their inventions thus display an almost unique
combination of the neotenous enjoyment of languageplay with the
discrimination of educated and powerful intelligence Further the
electronic media which knit them together are fluid hot connections
well adapted to both the dissemination of new slang and the ruthless
culling of weak and superannuated specimens The results of this
process give us perhaps a uniquely intense and accelerated view of
linguistic evolution in action

Hackish slang also challenges some common linguistic and
anthropological assumptions For example it has recently become
fashionable to speak of lowcontext versus highcontext
communication and to classify cultures by the preferred context level
of their languages and art forms It is usually claimed that
lowcontext communication characterized by precision clarity and
completeness of selfcontained utterances is typical in cultures
which value logic objectivity individualism and competition by
contrast highcontext communication elliptical emotive
nuancefilled multimodal heavily coded is associated with cultures
which value subjectivity consensus cooperation and tradition What
then are we to make of hackerdom which is themed around extremely
lowcontext interaction with computers and exhibits primarily
lowcontext values but cultivates an almost absurdly highcontext
slang style

The intensity and consciousness of hackish invention make a compilation
of hacker slang a particularly effective window into the surrounding
culture  and in fact this one is the latest version of an evolving
compilation called the Jargon File maintained by hackers themselves
for over 15 years This one like its ancestors is primarily a
lexicon but also includes topic entries which collect background or
sidelight information on hacker culture that would be awkward to try to
subsume under individual entries

Though the format is that of a reference volume it is intended that the
material be enjoyable to browse Even a complete outsider should find
at least a chuckle on nearly every page and much that is amusingly
thoughtprovoking But it is also true that hackers use humorous
wordplay to make strong sometimes combative statements about what they
feel Some of these entries reflect the views of opposing sides in
disputes that have been genuinely passionate this is deliberate We
have not tried to moderate or pretty up these disputes rather we have
attempted to ensure that everyones sacred cows get gored
impartially Compromise is not particularly a hackish virtue but the
honest presentation of divergent viewpoints is

The reader with minimal computer background who finds some references
incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them We have not felt it
either necessary or desirable to eliminate all such they too
contribute flavor and one of this documents major intended audiences
 fledgling hackers already partway inside the culture  will
benefit from them

A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor is included in
appendix A The outside readers attention is particularly directed
to appendix B A Portrait of J Random Hacker Appendix C is a
bibliography of nontechnical works which have either influenced or
described the hacker culture

Because hackerdom is an intentional culture one each individual must
choose by action to join one should not be surprised that the line
between description and influence can become more than a little blurred
Earlier versions of the Jargon File have played a central role in
spreading hacker language and the culture that goes with it to
successively larger populations and we hope and expect that this one
will do likewise

Of Slang Jargon and Techspeak


Linguists usually refer to informal language as slang and reserve the
term jargon for the technical vocabularies of various occupations
However the ancestor of this collection was called the Jargon File
and hackish slang is traditionally the jargon When talking about the
jargon there is therefore no convenient way to distinguish what a
linguist would call hackers jargon  the formal vocabulary they
learn from textbooks technical papers and manuals

To make a confused situation worse the line between hackish slang and
the vocabulary of technical programming and computer science is fuzzy
and shifts over time Further this vocabulary is shared with a wider
technical culture of programmers many of whom are not hackers and do
not speak or recognize hackish slang


Accordingly this lexicon will try to be as precise as the facts of
usage permit about the distinctions among three categories
 slang informal language from mainstream English or nontechnicalsubcultures bikers rock fans surfers etc
 jargon without qualifier denotes informal slangy languagepeculiar to hackers  the subject of this lexicon
 techspeak the formal technical vocabulary of programming computerscience electronics and other fields connected to hacking

This terminology will be consistently used throughout the remainder of
this lexicon

The jargontechspeak distinction is the delicate one A lot of
techspeak originated as jargon and there is a steady continuing uptake
of jargon into techspeak On the other hand a lot of jargon arises
from overgeneralization of techspeak terms there is more about this in
the Jargon Construction section below

In general we have considered techspeak any term that communicates
primarily by a denotation well established in textbooks technical
dictionaries or standards documents

A few obviously techspeak terms names of operating systems languages
or documents are listed when they are tied to hacker folklore that
isnt covered in formal sources or sometimes to convey critical
historical background necessary to understand other entries to which
they are crossreferenced Some other techspeak senses of jargon words
are listed in order to make the jargon senses clear where the text does
not specify that a straight technical sense is under discussion these
are marked with techspeak as an etymology Some entries have a
primary sense marked this way with subsequent jargon meanings explained
in terms of it

We have also tried to indicate where known the apparent origins of
terms The results are probably the least reliable information in the
lexicon for several reasons For one thing it is well known that many
hackish usages have been independently reinvented multiple times even
among the more obscure and intricate neologisms It often seems that
the generative processes underlying hackish jargon formation have an
internal logic so powerful as to create substantial parallelism across
separate cultures and even in different languages For another the
networks tend to propagate innovations so quickly that first use is
often impossible to pin down And finally compendia like this one
alter what they observe by implicitly stamping cultural approval on
terms and widening their use

Revision History


The original Jargon File was a collection of hacker jargon from
technical cultures including the MIT AI Lab the Stanford AI lab SAIL
and others of the old ARPANET AILISPPDP10 communities including Bolt
Beranek and Newman BBN CarnegieMellon University CMU and
Worcester Polytechnic Institute WPI

The Jargon File hereafter referred to as jargon1 or the File was
begun by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975 From this time until the
plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in 1991 the File was named
AIWORDRFUPDOC there Some terms in it date back considerably
earlier frob and some senses of moby for instance go back to the
Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT and are believed to date at least back
to the early 1960s The revisions of jargon1 were all unnumbered and
may be collectively considered Version 1

In 1976 Mark Crispin having seen an announcement about the File on the
SAIL computer FTPed a copy of the File to MIT He noticed that it
was hardly restricted to AI words and so stored the file on his
directory as AIMRCSAIL JARGON

The file was quickly renamed JARGON  the  means numbered with a
version number as a flurry of enhancements were made by Mark Crispin
and Guy L Steele Jr Unfortunately amidst all this activity nobody
thought of correcting the term jargon to slang until the compendium
had already become widely known as the Jargon File

Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter
and Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File which was
subsequently kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT with periodic
resynchronizations

The File expanded by fits and starts until about 1983 Richard Stallman
was prominent among the contributors adding many MIT and ITSrelated
coinages

In Spring 1981 a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of the
File published in Russell Brands CoEvolution Quarterly pages 2635
with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy Steele including a couple of
the Crunchly cartoons This appears to have been the Files first
paper publication

A late version of jargon1 expanded with commentary for the mass
market was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as The
Hackers Dictionary Harper  Row CN 1082 ISBN 0060910828 The
other jargon1 editors Raphael Finkel Don Woods and Mark Crispin
contributed to this revision as did Richard M Stallman and Geoff
Goodfellow This book now out of print is hereafter referred to as
Steele1983 and those six as the Steele1983 coauthors

Shortly after the publication of Steele1983 the File effectively
stopped growing and changing Originally this was due to a desire to
freeze the file temporarily to facilitate the production of Steele1983
but external conditions caused the temporary freeze to become
permanent

The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding cuts
and the resulting administrative decision to use vendorsupported
hardware and software instead of homebrew whenever possible At MIT
most AI work had turned to dedicated LISP Machines At the same time
the commercialization of AI technology lured some of the AI Labs best
and brightest away to startups along the Route 128 strip in
Massachusetts and out West in Silicon Valley The startups built LISP
machines for MIT the central MITAI computer became a TWENEX system
rather than a host for the AI hackers beloved ITS

The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980 although
the SAIL computer continued as a Computer Science Department resource
until 1991 Stanford became a major TWENEX site at one point
operating more than a dozen TOPS20 systems but by the mid1980s most
of the interesting software work was being done on the emerging BSD UNIX
standard

In April 1983 the PDP10centered cultures that had nourished the File
were dealt a deathblow by the cancellation of the Jupiter project at
Digital Equipment Corporation The Files compilers already dispersed
moved on to other things Steele1983 was partly a monument to what its
authors thought was a dying tradition no one involved realized at the
time just how wide its influence was to be

By the mid1980s the Files content was dated but the legend that had
grown up around it never quite died out The book and softcopies
obtained off the ARPANET circulated even in cultures far removed from
MIT and Stanford the content exerted a strong and continuing influence
on hackish language and humor Even as the advent of the microcomputer
and other trends fueled a tremendous expansion of hackerdom the File
and related materials such as the AI Koans in Appendix A came to be
seen as a sort of sacred epic a hackerculture Matter of Britain
chronicling the heroic exploits of the Knights of the Lab The pace of
change in hackerdom at large accelerated tremendously  but the Jargon
File having passed from living document to icon remained essentially
untouched for seven years

This revision contains nearly the entire text of a late version of
jargon1 a few obsolete PDP10related entries were dropped after
careful consultation with the editors of Steele1983 It merges in
about 80 of the Steele1983 text omitting some framing material and a
very few entries introduced in Steele1983 that are now also obsolete

This new version casts a wider net than the old Jargon File its aim is
to cover not just AI or PDP10 hacker culture but all the technical
computing cultures wherein the true hackernature is manifested More
than half of the entries now derive from USENET and represent jargon
now current in the C and UNIX communities but special efforts have been
made to collect jargon from other cultures including IBM PC programmers
Amiga fans Mac enthusiasts and even the IBM mainframe world

Eric S Raymond ericsnarkthyrsuscom maintains the new File with

by Eric Raymond ed MIT Press 1991 ISBN 0262680696 The
maintainers are committed to updating the online version of the Jargon
File through and beyond paper publication and will continue to make it
available to archives and publicaccess sites as a trust of the hacker
community

Here is a chronology of the high points in the recent online revisions

Version 211 Jun 12 1990 the Jargon File comes alive again after a
sevenyear hiatus Reorganization and massive additions were by Eric S

How Jargon Works


Jargon Construction


There are some standard methods of jargonification that became
established quite early ie before 1970 spreading from such sources
as the Tech Model Railroad Club the PDP1 SPACEWAR hackers and John
McCarthys original crew of LISPers These include the following


Verb Doubling  A standard construction in English is to
double a verb and use it as an exclamation such as Bang bang or
Quack quack Most of these are names for noises Hackers also
double verbs as a concise sometimes sarcastic comment on what the
implied subject does Also a doubled verb is often used to terminate a
conversation in the process remarking on the current state of affairs
or what the speaker intends to do next Typical examples involve win
lose hack flame barf chomp

 The disk heads just crashed Lose lose
 Mostly he talked about his latest crock Flame flame
 Boy what a bagbiter Chomp chomp

Some verbdoubled constructions have special meanings not immediately
obvious from the verb These have their own listings in the lexicon

The USENET culture has one tripling convention unrelated to this the
names of joke topic groups often have a tripled last element The
first and paradigmatic example was altswedishchefborkborkbork a
Muppet Show reference other classics include
altfrenchcaptainborgborgborg altwesleycrusherdiediedie
compunixinternalssystemcallsbrkbrkbrk
sciphysicsedwardtellerboomboomboom and
altsadisticdentistsdrilldrilldrill


Soundalike slang  Hackers will often make rhymes or
puns in order to convert an ordinary word or phrase into something more
interesting It is considered particularly flavorful if the phrase is
bent so as to include some other jargon word thus the computer hobbyist
magazine Dr Dobbs Journal is almost always referred to among hackers
as Dr Frobs Journal or simply Dr Frobs Terms of this kind that
have been in fairly wide use include names for newspapers

 Boston Herald  Horrid or Harried
 Boston Globe  Boston Glob
 Houston or San Francisco Chronicle
  the Crocknicle or the Comical
 New York Times  New York Slime

However terms like these are often made up on the spur of the moment
Standard examples include

 Data General  Dirty Genitals
 IBM 360  IBM ThreeSickly
 Government Property  Do Not Duplicate on keys
  Government Duplicity  Do Not Propagate
 for historical reasons  for hysterical raisins
 Margaret Jacks Hall the CS building at Stanford
  Marginal Hacks Hall

This is not really similar to the Cockney rhyming slang it has been
compared to in the past because Cockney substitutions are opaque
whereas hacker punning jargon is intentionally transparent


The P convention  Turning a word into a
question by appending the syllable P from the LISP convention of
appending the letter P to denote a predicate a booleanvalued
function The question should expect a yesno answer though it
neednt See T and NIL

 At dinnertime
 Q Foodp
 A Yeah Im pretty hungry or T

 At any time
 Q StateoftheworldP
 A Straight Im about to go home
 A Humorous Yes the world has a state

 On the phone to Florida
 Q Statep Florida
 A Been reading JARGONTXT again eh

One of the best of these is a Gosperism Once when we were at a
Chinese restaurant Bill Gosper wanted to know whether someone would
like to share with him a twopersonsized bowl of soup His inquiry
was Splitp soup  GLS


Overgeneralization  A very conspicuous feature of
jargon is the frequency with which techspeak items such as names of
program tools command language primitives and even assembler opcodes
are applied to contexts outside of computing wherever hackers find
amusing analogies to them Thus to cite one of the bestknown
examples UNIX hackers often grep for things rather than searching for
them Many of the lexicon entries are generalizations of exactly this
kind

Hackers enjoy overgeneralization on the grammatical level as well Many
hackers love to take various words and add the wrong endings to them to
make nouns and verbs often by extending a standard rule to nonuniform
cases or vice versa For example because

 porous  porosity
 generous  generosity

hackers happily generalize

 mysterious  mysteriosity
 ferrous  ferrosity
 obvious  obviosity
 dubious  dubiosity

Also note that all nouns can be verbed Eg All nouns can be
verbed Ill mouse it up Hang on while I clipboard it over Im
grepping the files English as a whole is already heading in this
direction towards purepositional grammar like Chinese hackers are
simply a bit ahead of the curve

However note that hackers avoid the unimaginative verbmaking
techniques characteristic of marketroids beancounters and the
Pentagon a hacker would never for example productize prioritize
or securitize things Hackers have a strong aversion to bureaucratic
bafflegab and regard those who use it with contempt

Similarly all verbs can be nouned This is only a slight
overgeneralization in modern English in hackish however it is good
form to mark them in some standard nonstandard way Thus

 win  winnitude winnage
 disgust  disgustitude
 hack  hackification

Further note the prevalence of certain kinds of nonstandard plural
forms Some of these go back quite a ways the TMRC Dictionary noted
that the defined plural of caboose is cabeese and includes an entry
which implies that the plural of mouse is meeces On a similarly
AngloSaxon note almost anything ending in x may form plurals in
xen see VAXen and boxen in the main text Even words ending in
phonetic k alone are sometimes treated this way eg soxen for a
bunch of socks Other funny plurals are frobbotzim for the plural of
frobbozz see frobnitz and Unices and Twenices rather than
Unixes and Twenexes see UNIX TWENEX in main text But note
that Unixen and Twenexen are never used it has been suggested that
this is because ix and ex are Latin singular endings that attract
a Latinate plural Finally it has been suggested to general approval
that the plural of mongoose ought to be polygoose

The pattern here as with other hackish grammatical quirks is
generalization of an inflectional rule that in English is either an
import or a fossil such as the Hebrew plural ending im or the
AngloSaxon plural suffix en to cases where it isnt normally
considered to apply

This is not poor grammar as hackers are generally quite well aware of
what they are doing when they distort the language It is grammatical
creativity a form of playfulness It is done not to impress but to
amuse and never at the expense of clarity


Spoken inarticulations  Words such as
mumble sigh and groan are spoken in places where their referent
might more naturally be used It has been suggested that this usage
derives from the impossibility of representing such noises on a comm
link or in electronic mail interestingly the same sorts of
constructions have been showing up with increasing frequency in comic
strips Another expression sometimes heard is Complain meaning I
have a complaint


Anthromorphization  Semantically one rich source
of jargon constructions is the hackish tendency to anthropomorphize
hardware and software This isnt done in a naive way hackers dont
personalize their stuff in the sense of feeling empathy with it nor do
they mystically believe that the things they work on every day are
alive What is common is to hear hardware or software talked about
as though it has homunculi talking to each other inside it with
intentions and desires Thus one hears The protocol handler got
confused or that programs are trying to do things or one may say of
a routine that its goal in life is to X One even hears explanations
like  and its poor little brain couldnt understand X and it
died Sometimes modelling things this way actually seems to make them
easier to understand perhaps because its instinctively natural to
think of anything with a really complex behavioral repertoire as like a
person rather than like a thing



Of the six listed constructions verb doubling peculiar noun
formations anthromorphization and especially spoken inarticulations
have become quite general but punning jargon is still largely confined
to MIT and other large universities and the P convention is found
only where LISPers flourish

Finally note that many words in hacker jargon have to be understood as
members of sets of comparatives This is especially true of the
adjectives and nouns used to describe the beauty and functional quality
of code Here is an approximately correct spectrum

 monstrosity braindamage screw bug lose misfeature
 crock kluge hack win feature elegance perfection

The last is spoken of as a mythical absolute approximated but never
actually attained Another similar scale is used for describing the
reliability of software

 broken flaky dodgy fragile brittle
 solid robust bulletproof armorplated

Note however that dodgy is primarily Commonwealth hackish it is
rare in the US and may change places with flaky for some speakers

Coinages for describing lossage seem to call forth the very finest in
hackish linguistic inventiveness it has been truly said that hackers
have even more words for equipment failures than Yiddish has for
obnoxious people

Hacker Writing Style


Weve already seen that hackers often coin jargon by overgeneralizing
grammatical rules This is one aspect of a more general fondness for
formversuscontent language jokes that shows up particularly in hackish
writing One correspondent reports that he consistently misspells
wrong as worng Others have been known to criticize glitches in
Jargon File drafts by observing in the mode of Douglas Hofstadter
This sentence no verb or Bad speling or Incorrectspa cing
Similarly intentional spoonerisms are often made of phrases relating to
confusion or things that are confusing dain bramage for brain
damage is perhaps the most common similarly a hacker would be likely
to write Excuse me Im cixelsyd today rather than Im dyslexic
today This sort of thing is quite common and is enjoyed by all
concerned

Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parentheses much
to the dismay of American editors Thus if Jim is going is a phrase
and so are Bill runs and Spock groks then hackers generally prefer
to write Jim is going Bill runs and Spock groks This is
incorrect according to standard American usage which would put the
continuation commas and the final period inside the string quotes
however it is counterintuitive to hackers to mutilate literal strings
with characters that dont belong in them Given the sorts of examples
that can come up in discussions of programming Americanstyle quoting
can even be grossly misleading When communicating command lines or
small pieces of code extra characters can be a real pain in the neck

Consider for example a sentence in a vi tutorial that looks like this

 Then delete a line from the file by typing dd

Standard usage would make this

 Then delete a line from the file by typing dd

but that would be very bad  because the reader would be prone to type
the string dddot and it happens that in vi1 dot repeats the last
command accepted The net result would be to delete two lines

The Jargon File follows hackish usage throughout

Interestingly a similar style is now preferred practice in Great
Britain though the older style which became established for
typographical reasons having to do with the aesthetics of comma and
quotes in typeset text is still accepted there Harts Rules and the
Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors call the hackerlike style
new or logical quoting

Another hacker quirk is a tendency to distinguish between scare quotes
and speech quotes that is to use Britishstyle single quotes for
marking and reserve Americanstyle double quotes for actual reports of
speech or text included from elsewhere Interestingly some authorities
describe this as correct general usage but mainstream American English
has gone to using doublequotes indiscriminately enough that hacker
usage appears marked and in fact I thought this was a personal quirk
of mine until I checked with USENET  ESR One further permutation
that is definitely not standard is a hackish tendency to do marking
quotes by using apostrophes single quotes in pairs that is like
this This is modelled on string and character literal syntax in some
programming languages reinforced by the fact that many characteronly
terminals display the apostrophe in typewriter style as a vertical
single quote

One quirk that shows up frequently in the email style of UNIX hackers
in particular is a tendency for some things that are normally
alllowercase including usernames and the names of commands and C
routines to remain uncapitalized even when they occur at the beginning
of sentences It is clear that for many hackers the case of such
identifiers becomes a part of their internal representation the
spelling and cannot be overridden without mental effort an
appropriate reflex because UNIX and C both distinguish cases and
confusing them can lead to lossage A way of escaping this dilemma
is simply to avoid using these constructions at the beginning of
sentences

There seems to be a metarule behind these nonstandard hackerisms to the
effect that precision of expression is more important than conformance
to traditional rules where the latter create ambiguity or lose
information they can be discarded without a second thought It is
notable in this respect that other hackish inventions for example in
vocabulary also tend to carry very precise shades of meaning even when
constructed to appear slangy and loose In fact to a hacker the
contrast between loose form and tight content in jargon is a
substantial part of its humor

Hackers have also developed a number of punctuation and emphasis
conventions adapted to singlefont allASCII communications links and
these are occasionally carried over into written documents even when
normal means of font changes underlining and the like are available

One of these is that TEXT IN ALL CAPS IS INTERPRETED AS LOUD and this
becomes such an ingrained synesthetic reflex that a person who goes to
capslock while in talk mode may be asked to stop shouting please
youre hurting my ears

Also it is common to use bracketing with unusual characters to signify
emphasis The asterisk is most common as in What the hell even
though this interferes with the common use of the asterisk suffix as a
footnote mark The underscore is also common suggesting underlining
this is particularly common with book titles for example It is often
alleged that Joe Haldeman wrote _The_Forever_War_ as a rebuttal to
Robert Heinleins earlier novel of the future military
_Starship_Troopers_ Other forms exemplified by hell hell
or hell are occasionally seen its claimed that in the last example
the first slash pushes the letters over to the right to make them
italic and the second keeps them from falling over Finally words
may also be emphasized L I K E T H I S or by a series of carets 
under them on the next line of the text

There is a semantic difference between emphasis like this which
emphasizes the phrase as a whole and emphasis like this which
suggests the writer speaking very slowly and distinctly as if to a
very young child or a mentally impaired person Bracketing a word with
the  character may also indicate that the writer wishes readers to
consider that an action is taking place or that a sound is being made
Examples bang hic ring grin kick stomp mumble

There is also an accepted convention for writing under erasure the
text

 Be nice to this foolHHHHgentleman hes in from corporate HQ

would be read as Be nice to this fool I mean this gentleman This
comes from the fact that the digraph H is often used as a print
representation for a backspace It parallels and may have been
influenced by the ironic use of slashouts in sciencefiction
fanzines

In a formula  signifies multiplication but two asterisks in a row
are a shorthand for exponentiation this derives from FORTRAN Thus
one might write 2  8  256

Another notation for exponentiation one sees more frequently uses the
caret  ASCII 1011110 one might write instead 28  256 This
goes all the way back to Algol60 which used the archaic ASCII
uparrow that later became the caret this was picked up by Kemeny and
Kurtzs original BASIC which in turn influenced the design of the
bc1 and dc1 UNIX tools which have probably done most to
reinforce the convention on USENET The notation is mildly confusing to
C programmers because  means bitwise XOR in C Despite this it
was favored 31 over  in a late1990 snapshot of USENET It is used
consistently in this text

In online exchanges hackers tend to use decimal forms or improper
fractions 35 or 72 rather than typewriter style mixed
fractions 312 The major motive here is probably that the former
are more readable in a monospaced font together with a desire to avoid
the risk that the latter might be read as three minus onehalf The
decimal form is definitely preferred for fractions with a terminating
decimal representation there may be some cultural influence here from
the high status of scientific notation

Another online convention used especially for very large or very small
numbers is taken from C which derived it from FORTRAN This is a
form of scientific notation using e to replace 10 for example
one year is about 3e7 seconds long

The tilde  is commonly used in a quantifying sense of
approximately that is 50 means about fifty

On USENET and in the MUD world common C boolean logical and
relational operators such as        
and   and  are often combined with English The Pascal
notequals  is also recognized and occasionally one sees  for
notequals from Ada Common Lisp and Fortran 90 The use of prefix
 as a loose synonym for not or no is particularly common thus
clue is read noclue or clueless

A related practice borrows syntax from preferred programming languages
to express ideas in a naturallanguage text For example one might
see the following

 I resently had occasion to fieldtest the Snafu
 Systems 2300E adaptive gonkulator The price was
 right and the racing stripe on the case looked kind
 of neat but its performance left something to be
 desired

 ifdef FLAME
 Hasnt anyone told those idiots that you cant get
 decent bogon suppression with AFJ filters at todays
 net speeds
 endif  FLAME 

 I guess they figured the price premium for true
 framebased semantic analysis was too high
 Unfortunately its also the only workable approach
 I wouldnt recommend purchase of this product unless
 youre on a very tight budget

 include disclaimerh
 
  Frank Foonly Fubarco Systems

In the above the ifdefendif pair is a conditional
compilation syntax from C here it implies that the text between
which is a flame should be evaluated only if you have turned on
or defined on the switch FLAME The include at the end is C
for include standard disclaimer here the standard disclaimer is
understood to read roughly These are my personal opinions and not
to be construed as the official position of my employer

Another habit is that of using anglebracket enclosure to genericize a
term this derives from conventions used in BNF Uses like the
following are common

 So this ethnic walks into a bar one day and

Hackers also mix letters and numbers more freely than in mainstream
usage In particular it is good hackish style to write a digit
sequence where you intend the reader to understand the text string that
names that number in English So hackers prefer to write 1970s
rather than nineteenseventies or 1970s the latter looks like a
possessive

It should also be noted that hackers exhibit much less reluctance to use
multiply nested parentheses than is normal in English Part of this is
almost certainly due to influence from LISP which uses deeply nested
parentheses like this see in its syntax a lot but it has also
been suggested that a more basic hacker trait of enjoying playing with
complexity and pushing systems to their limits is in operation

One area where hackish conventions for online writing are still in some
flux is the marking of included material from earlier messages  what
would be called block quotations in ordinary English From the usual
typographic convention employed for these smaller font at an extra
indent there derived the notation of included text being indented by
one ASCII TAB 0001001 character which under UNIX and many other
environments gives the appearance of an 8space indent

Early mail and netnews readers had no facility for including messages
this way so people had to paste in copy manually BSD Mail1 was
the first message agent to support inclusion and early USENETters
emulated its style But the TAB character tended to push included text
too far to the right especially in multiply nested inclusions leading
to ugly wraparounds After a brief period of confusion during which an
inclusion leader consisting of three or four spaces became established
in EMACS and a few mailers the use of leading  or   became
standard perhaps owing to its use in ed1 to display tabs
alternatively it may derive from the  that some early UNIX mailers
used to quote lines starting with From in text so they wouldnt look
like the beginnings of new message headers Inclusions within
inclusions keep their  leaders so the nesting level of a quotation
is visually apparent

A few other idiosyncratic quoting styles survive because they are
automatically generated One particularly ugly one looks like this

  Written hhmm pm Mmm dd yyyy by usersite in group 
   Article subject chopped to 35 ch  
 quoted text
  End of text from localgroup 

It is generated by an elderly variant newsreading system called
notesfiles The overall trend however is definitely away from such
verbosity

The practice of including text from the parent article when posting a
followup helped solve what had been a major nuisance on USENET the fact
that articles do not arrive at different sites in the same order
Careless posters used to post articles that would begin with or even
consist entirely of No thats wrong or I agree or the like It
was hard to see who was responding to what Consequently around 1984
new newsposting software evolved a facility to automatically include
the text of a previous article marked with   or whatever the poster
chose The poster was expected to delete all but the relevant lines
The result has been that now careless posters post articles containing
the entire text of a preceding article followed only by No thats
wrong or I agree

Many people feel that this cure is worse than the original disease and
there soon appeared newsreader software designed to let the reader skip
over included text if desired Today some posting software rejects
articles containing too high a proportion of lines beginning with  
but this too has led to undesirable workarounds such as the deliberate
inclusion of zerocontent filler lines which arent quoted and thus pull
the message below the rejection threshold

Because the default mailers supplied with UNIX and other operating
systems havent evolved as quickly as human usage the older conventions
using a leading TAB or three or four spaces are still alive however
inclusion is now clearly the prevalent form in both netnews and mail

In 1991 practice is still evolving and disputes over the correct
inclusion style occasionally lead to holy wars One variant style
reported uses the citation character  in place of  for extended
quotations where original variations in indentation are being retained
One also sees different styles of quoting a number of authors in the
same message one deprecated because it loses information uses a
leader of   for everyone another the most common is      
   etc or     etc depending on line length and
nesting depth reflecting the original order of messages and yet
another is to use a different citation leader for each author say  
      preserving nesting so that the inclusion order of
messages is still apparent or tagging the inclusions with authors
names Yet another style is to use each posters initials or login
name as a citation leader for that poster Occasionally one sees a 
 leader used for quotations from authoritative sources such as
standards documents the intended allusion is to the root prompt the
special UNIX command prompt issued when one is running as the privileged
superuser

Finally it is worth mentioning that many studies of online
communication have shown that electronic links have a deinhibiting
effect on people Deprived of the bodylanguage cues through which
emotional state is expressed people tend to forget everything about
other parties except what is presented over that ASCII link This has
both good and bad effects The good one is that it encourages honesty
and tends to break down hierarchical authority relationships the bad is
that it may encourage depersonalization and gratuitous rudeness
Perhaps in response to this experienced netters often display a sort of
conscious formal politesse in their writing that has passed out of
fashion in other spoken and written media for example the phrase Well
said sir is not uncommon

Many introverted hackers who are next to inarticulate in person
communicate with considerable fluency over the net perhaps precisely
because they can forget on an unconscious level that they are dealing
with people and thus dont feel stressed and anxious as they would face
to face

Though it is considered gauche to publicly criticize posters for poor
spelling or grammar the network places a premium on literacy and
clarity of expression It may well be that future historians of
literature will see in it a revival of the great tradition of personal
letters as art

Hacker Speech Style


Hackish speech generally features extremely precise diction careful
word choice a relatively large working vocabulary and relatively
little use of contractions or street slang Dry humor irony puns and
a mildly flippant attitude are highly valued  but an underlying
seriousness and intelligence are essential One should use just enough
jargon to communicate precisely and identify oneself as a member of the
culture overuse of jargon or a breathless excessively gungho attitude
is considered tacky and the mark of a loser

This speech style is a variety of the precisionist English normally
spoken by scientists design engineers and academics in technical
fields In contrast with the methods of jargon construction it is
fairly constant throughout hackerdom

It has been observed that many hackers are confused by negative
questions  or at least that the people to whom they are talking are
often confused by the sense of their answers The problem is that they
have done so much programming that distinguishes between

 if going 

and

 if going 

that when they parse the question Arent you going it seems to be
asking the opposite question from Are you going and so merits an
answer in the opposite sense This confuses Englishspeaking
nonhackers because they were taught to answer as though the negative
part werent there In some other languages including Russian
Chinese and Japanese the hackish interpretation is standard and the
problem wouldnt arise Hackers often find themselves wishing for a
word like French si or German doch with which one could
unambiguously answer yes to a negative question

For similar reasons Englishspeaking hackers almost never use double
negatives even if they live in a region where colloquial usage allows
them The thought of uttering something that logically ought to be an
affirmative knowing it will be misparsed as a negative tends to disturb
them

Heres a related quirk A nonhacker who is indelicate enough to ask
a question like So are you working on finding that bug now
or leaving it until later is likely to get the perfectly correct
answer Yes that is Yes Im doing it either now or later and
you didnt ask which

International Style


Although the Jargon File remains primarily a lexicon of hacker usage in
American English we have made some effort to get input from abroad
Though the hackerspeak of other languages often uses translations of
jargon from English often as transmitted to them by earlier Jargon File
versions the local variations are interesting and knowledge of them
may be of some use to travelling hackers

There are some references herein to Commonwealth English These are
intended to describe some variations in hacker usage as reported in the
English spoken in Great Britain and the Commonwealth Canada Australia
India etc  though Canada is heavily influenced by American usage
There is also an entry on Commonwealth Hackish reporting some
general phonetic and vocabulary differences from US hackish

Hackers in Western Europe and especially Scandinavia are reported to
often use a mixture of English and their native languages for technical
conversation Occasionally they develop idioms in their English usage
that are influenced by their nativelanguage styles Some of these are
reported here

A few notes on hackish usages in Russian have been added where they are
parallel with English idioms and thus comprehensible to
Englishspeakers

How to Use the Lexicon


Pronunciation Guide


Pronunciation keys are provided in the jargon listings for all entries
that are neither dictionary words pronounced as in standard English nor
obvious compounds thereof Slashes bracket phonetic pronunciations
which are to be interpreted using the following conventions

 1 Syllables are hyphenseparated except that an accent or backaccent
 follows each accented syllable the backaccent marks a secondary
 accent in some words of four or more syllables

 2 Consonants are pronounced as in American English The letter g is
 always hard as in got rather than giant ch is soft
 church rather than chemist The letter j is the sound
 that occurs twice in judge The letter s is always as in
 pass never a z sound The digraph kh is the guttural of
 loch or lchaim

 3 Uppercase letters are pronounced as their English letter names thus
 for example HLL is equivalent to aitch el el Z may
 be pronounced zee or zed depending on your local dialect

 4 Vowels are represented as follows

 oo with optional fronting as in news nooz or nyooz

A  is used for the schwa sound of unstressed or occluded vowels
the one that is often written with an upsidedown e The schwa
vowel is omitted in syllables containing vocalic r l m or n that is
kitten and color would be rendered kitn and kuhlr not
kitn and kuhlr

Entries with a pronunciation of  are writtenonly usages No UNIX
weenies this does not mean pronounce like previous pronunciation

Other Lexicon Conventions


Entries are sorted in caseblind ASCII collation order rather than the
letterbyletter order ignoring interword spacing common in mainstream
dictionaries except that all entries beginning with nonalphabetic
characters are sorted after Z The caseblindness is a feature not a
bug

The beginning of each entry is marked by a colon  at the
left margin This convention helps out tools like hypertext browsers
that benefit from knowing where entry boundaries are but arent as
contextsensitive as humans

In pure ASCII renderings of the Jargon File you will see  used to
bracket words which themselves have entries in the File This isnt
done all the time for every such word but it is done everywhere that a
reminder seems useful that the term has a jargon meaning and one might
wish to refer to its entry

In this allASCII version headwords for topic entries are distinguished
from those for ordinary entries by being followed by  rather than
 similarly references are surrounded by  and  rather than
 and 

Defining instances of terms and phrases appear in slanted type A
defining instance is one which occurs near to or as part of an
explanation of it

Prefix  is used as linguists do to mark examples of incorrect usage

We follow the logical quoting convention described in the Writing
Style section above In addition we reserve double quotes for actual
excerpts of text or sometimes invented speech Scare quotes which
mark a word being used in a nonstandard way and philosophers quotes
which turn an utterance into the string of letters or words that name
it are both rendered with single quotes

References such as malloc3 and patch1 are to UNIX facilities
some of which such as patch1 are actually freeware distributed
over USENET The UNIX manuals use foon to refer to item foo in
section n of the manual where n1 is utilities n2 is system calls
n3 is C library routines n6 is games and n8 where present is
system administration utilities Sections 4 5 and 7 of the manuals
have changed roles frequently and in any case are not referred to in any
of the entries

Some other etymology abbreviations such as UNIX and PDP10
refer to technical cultures surrounding specific operating systems
processors or other environments The fact that a term is labelled
with any one of these abbreviations does not necessarily mean its use
is confined to that culture In particular many terms labelled MIT
and Stanford are in quite general use We have tried to give some
indication of the distribution of speakers in the usage notes
however a number of factors mentioned in the introduction conspire to
make these indications less definite than might be desirable

A few new definitions attached to entries are marked proposed
These are usually generalizations suggested by editors or USENET
respondents in the process of commenting on previous definitions of
those entries These are not represented as established

ABEND ABnormal END ahbend bend n Abnormal
 termination of software crash lossage Derives from an
 error message on the IBM 360 used jokingly by hackers but
 seriously mainly by code grinders Usually capitalized but may
 appear as abend Hackers will try to persuade you that ABEND is
 called abend because it is what system operators do to the
 machine late on Friday when they want to call it a day and hence
 is from the German Abend  Evening

accumulator n 1 Archaic term for a register Online use of it
 as a synonym for register is a fairly reliable indication that
 the user has been around for quite a while andor that the
 architecture under discussion is quite old The term in full is
 almost never used of microprocessor registers for example though
 symbolic names for arithmetic registers beginning in A derive
 from historical use of the term accumulator and not actually
 from arithmetic Confusingly though an A register name
 prefix may also stand for address as for example on the
 Motorola 680x0 family 2 A register being used for arithmetic or
 logic as opposed to addressing or a loop index especially one
 being used to accumulate a sum or count of many items This use is
 in context of a particular routine or stretch of code The
 FOOBAZ routine uses A3 as an accumulator 3 Ones inbasket
 esp among oldtimers who might use sense 1 You want this
 reviewed Sure just put it in the accumulator See stack

ACK ak interj 1 from the ASCII mnemonic for 0000110
 Acknowledge Used to register ones presence compare mainstream

 surprised disgust esp in Ack pffft Semihumorous
 Generally this sense is not spelled in caps ACK and is
 distinguished by a following exclamation point 3 Used to
 politely interrupt someone to tell them you understand their point
 see NAK Thus for example you might cut off an overly
 long explanation with Ack Ack Ack I get it now

 There is also a usage ACK from sense 1 meaning Are you

 made inside certain programs esp expert systems which lead to
 the appearance of semiintelligent behavior but are in fact
 entirely arbitrary For example fuzzymatching input tokens that
 might be typing errors against a symbol table can make it look as

 with some awkward input that would otherwise cause a program to
 choke presuming normal inputs are dealt with in some cleaner

 mandatory for Department of Defense software projects by the
 Pentagon Hackers are nearly unanimous in observing that
 technically it is precisely what one might expect given that kind
 of endorsement by fiat designed by committee crockish difficult
 to use and overall a disastrous multibilliondollar boondoggle
 one common description is The PLI of the 1980s Hackers
 find Adas exceptionhandling and interprocess communication
 features particularly hilarious Ada Lovelace the daughter of
 Lord Byron who became the worlds first programmer while
 cooperating with Charles Babbage on the design of his mechanical
 computing engines in the mid1800s would almost certainly blanch
 at the use to which her name has latterly been put the kindest

ADVENT advent n The prototypical computer adventure game first
 implemented on the PDP10 by Will Crowther as an attempt at
 computerrefereed fantasy gaming and expanded into a
 puzzleoriented game by Don Woods Now better known as Adventure
 but the TOPS10 operating system permitted only 6letter
 filenames See also vadding

 This game defined the terse dryly humorous style now expected in
 text adventure games and popularized several tag lines that have
 become fixtures of hackerspeak A huge green fierce snake bars
 the way I see no X here for some noun X You are in a
 maze of twisty little passages all alike You are in a little
 maze of twisty passages all different The magic words
 xyzzy and plugh also derive from this game

 NPcomplete see NP adj Used to describe problems or
 subproblems in AI to indicate that the solution presupposes a
 solution to the strong AI problem that is the synthesis of a

 other words just too hard

 Examples of AIcomplete problems are The Vision Problem
 building a system that can see as well as a human and The
 Natural Language Problem building a system that can understand

 of UNIX AIX especially for the AIX 3 used in the IBM RS6000
 series A victim of the dreaded hybridism disease this
 attempt to combine the two main currents of the UNIX stream
 BSD and USG UNIX became a monstrosity to haunt
 system administrators dreams For example if new accounts are
 created while many users are logged on the load average jumps
 quickly over 20 due to silly implementation of the user databases

 failure a twinengine airplane has twice as many engine problems
 as a singleengine airplane By analogy in both software and
 electronics the rule that simplicity increases robustness see
 also KISS Principle It is correspondingly argued that the
 right way to build reliable systems is to put all your eggs in one
 basket after making sure that youve built a really good
 basket

aliasing bug n A class of subtle programming errors that can
 arise in code that does dynamic allocation esp via
 malloc3 or equivalent If more than one pointer addresses
 aliases for a given hunk of storage it may happen that the
 storage is freed or reallocated and thus moved through one alias
 and then referenced through another which may lead to subtle and
 possibly intermittent lossage depending on the state and the
 allocation history of the malloc arena Avoidable by use of
 allocation strategies that never alias allocated core Also
 avoidable by use of higherlevel languages such as LISP
 which employ a garbage collector see GC Also called a
 stale pointer bug See also precedence lossage
 smash the stack fandango on core memory leak
 memory smash overrun screw spam

 Historical note Though this term is nowadays associated with
 C programming it was already in use in a very similar sense in the
 Algol60 and FORTRAN communities in the 1960s

allelbows adj Of a TSR terminateandstayresident IBM PC
 program such as the N popup calendar and calculator utilities
 that circulate on BBS systems unsociable Used to describe a
 program that rudely steals the resources that it needs without
 considering that other TSRs may also be resident One particularly
 common form of rudeness is lockup due to programs fighting over
 the keyboard interrupt See rude also messdos

alpha particles n See bit rot

alt awlt 1 n The alt shift key on an IBM PC or clone

 term usually reveals that the speaker hacked PCs before coming to
 the Mac see also feature key Some Mac hackers
 confusingly reserve alt for the Option key 3 nobs PDP10
 often capitalized to ALT Alternate name for the ASCII
 ESC character ASCII 0011011 after the keycap labeling on some
 older terminals Also altmode awltmohd This character
 was almost never pronounced escape on an ITS system in
 TECO or under TOPS10  always alt as in Type alt alt to
 end a TECO command or altU onto the system for log onto
 the ITS system This was probably because alt is more
 convenient to say than escape especially when followed by
 another alt or a character or another alt and a character

AOS 1 aws East Coast ayos West Coast based on a
 PDP10 increment instruction vtobs To increase the amount of
 something AOS the campfire Usage considered silly and now
 obsolete Now largely supplanted by bump See SOS 2 A
 Multicsderived OS supported at one time by Data General This
 was pronounced AOS or Aos A spoof of the standard
 AOS system administrators manual How to Load and Generate
 your AOS System was created issued a part number and circulated
 as photocopy folklore It was called How to Goad and
 Levitate your CHAOS System 3 Algebraic Operating System in
 reference to those calculators which use infix instead of postfix
 reverse Polish notation

 Historical note AOS in sense 1 was the name of a PDP10
 instruction that took any memory location in the computer and added
 1 to it AOS meant Add One and do not Skip Why you may ask
 does the S stand for do not Skip rather than for Skip Ah
 here was a beloved piece of PDP10 folklore There were eight such
 instructions AOSE added 1 and then skipped the next instruction
 if the result was Equal to zero AOSG added 1 and then skipped if
 the result was Greater than 0 AOSN added 1 and then skipped
 if the result was Not 0 AOSA added 1 and then skipped Always
 and so on Just plain AOS didnt say when to skip so it never
 skipped

 For similar reasons AOJ meant Add One and do not Jump Even
 more bizarre SKIP meant do not SKIP If you wanted to skip the
 next instruction you had to say SKIPA Likewise JUMP meant
 do not JUMP the unconditional form was JUMPA However hackers
 never did this By some quirk of the 10s design the JRST
 Jump and ReSTore flag with no flag specified was actually faster
 and so was invariably used Such were the perverse mysteries of
 assembler programming

app ap n Short for application program as opposed to a
 systems program What systems vendors are forever chasing
 developers to create for their environments so they can sell more
 boxes Hackers tend not to think of the things they themselves run
 as apps thus in hacker parlance the term excludes compilers
 program editors games and messaging systems though a user would
 consider all those to be apps Oppose tool operating

arc primarily MSDOS vt To create a compressed archive from a
 group of files using SEA ARC PKWare PKARC or a compatible
 program Rapidly becoming obsolete as the ARC compression method
 is falling into disuse having been replaced by newer compression
 techniques See tar and feather zip

arc wars primarily MSDOS n holy wars over which archiving
 program one should use The first arc war was sparked when System
 Enhancement Associates SEA sued PKWare for copyright and
 trademark infringement on its ARC program PKWares PKARC
 outperformed ARC on both compression and speed while largely
 retaining compatibility it introduced a new compression type that
 could be disabled for backwardcompatibility PKWare settled out
 of court to avoid enormous legal costs both SEA and PKWare are
 small companies as part of the settlement the name of PKARC was
 changed to PKPAK The public backlash against SEA for bringing
 suit helped to hasten the demise of ARC as a standard when PKWare
 and others introduced new incompatible archivers with better
 compression algorithms

archive n 1 A collection of several files bundled into one file
 by a program such as ar1 tar1 cpio1
 or arc for shipment or archiving sense 2 See also tar
 and feather 2 A collection of files or archives sense 1 made
 available from an archive site via FTP or an email server

arena UNIX n The area of memory attached to a process by
 brk2 and sbrk2 and used by malloc3 as
 dynamic storage So named from a semimythical malloc
 corrupt arena message supposedly emitted when some early versions
 became terminally confused See overrun screw aliasing
 bug memory leak memory smash smash the stack

arg arg n Abbreviation for argument to a function
 used so often as to have become a new word like piano from
 pianoforte The sine function takes 1 arg but the
 arctangent function can take either 1 or 2 args Compare

armorplated n Syn for bulletproof

asbestos adj Used as a modifier to anything intended to protect
 one from flames Important cases of this include asbestos
 longjohns and asbestos cork award but it is used more
 generally

asbestos cork award n Once long ago at MIT there was a flamer
 so consistently obnoxious that another hacker designed had made
 and distributed posters announcing that said flamer had been
 nominated for the asbestos cork award Persons in any doubt as
 to the intended application of the cork should consult the
 etymology under flame Since then it is agreed that only a
 select few have risen to the heights of bombast required to earn
 this dubious dignity  but there is no agreement on which
 few

asbestos longjohns n Notional garments often donned by USENET
 posters just before emitting a remark they expect will elicit
 flamage This is the most common of the asbestos coinages
 Also asbestos underwear asbestos overcoat etc

ASCII American Standard Code for Information Interchange
 askee n The predominant character set encoding of presentday
 computers Uses 7 bits for each character whereas most earlier
 codes including an early version of ASCII used fewer This
 change allowed the inclusion of lowercase letters  a major
 win  but it did not provide for accented letters or any
 other letterforms not used in English such as the German sharpS
 and the aeligature
 which is a letter in for example Norwegian It could be worse
 though It could be much worse See EBCDIC to understand how

 Computers are much pickier and less flexible about spelling than
 humans thus hackers need to be very precise when talking about
 characters and have developed a considerable amount of verbal
 shorthand for them Every character has one or more names  some
 formal some concise some silly Common jargon names for ASCII
 characters are collected here See also individual entries for

 The pronunciation of  as pound is common in the US
 but a bad idea Commonwealth Hackish has its own rather more
 apposite use of pound sign confusingly on British keyboards
 the pound graphic
 happens to replace  thus Britishers sometimes
 call  on a USASCII keyboard pound compounding the
 American error The US usage derives from an oldfashioned
 commercial practice of using a  suffix to tag pound weights
 on bills of lading The character is usually pronounced hash
 outside the US

 The uparrow name for circumflex and leftarrow name for
 underline are historical relics from archaic ASCII the 1963
 version which had these graphics in those character positions
 rather than the modern punctuation characters

 The swung dash or approximation sign is not quite the same
 as tilde in typeset material
 but the ASCII tilde serves for both compare angle
 brackets

 Some other common usages cause odd overlaps The 
   and  characters for example are all
 pronounced hex in different communities because various
 assemblers use them as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants in
 particular  in many assemblerprogramming cultures
  in the 6502 world  at Texas Instruments and
  on the BBC Micro Sinclair and some Z80 machines See
 also splat

 The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the
 worlds other major languages makes the designers choice of 7 bits
 look more and more like a serious misfeature as the use of
 international networks continues to increase see software
 rot Hardware and software from the US still tends to embody
 the assumption that ASCII is the universal character set this is a
 a major irritant to people who want to use a character set suited
 to their own languages Perversely though efforts to solve this
 problem by proliferating national character sets produce an
 evolutionary pressure to use a smaller subset common to all
 those in use

back door n A hole in the security of a system deliberately left
 in place by designers or maintainers The motivation for this is
 not always sinister some operating systems for example come out
 of the box with privileged accounts intended for use by field
 service technicians or the vendors maintenance programmers

 Historically back doors have often lurked in systems longer than
 anyone expected or planned and a few have become widely known
 The infamous RTM worm of late 1988 for example used a back door
 in the BSD UNIX sendmail8 utility

 Ken Thompsons 1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM revealed the
 existence of a back door in early UNIX versions that may have
 qualified as the most fiendishly clever security hack of all time
 The C compiler contained code that would recognize when the
 login command was being recompiled and insert some code
 recognizing a password chosen by Thompson giving him entry to the
 system whether or not an account had been created for him

 Normally such a back door could be removed by removing it from the
 source code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler But to
 recompile the compiler you have to use the compiler  so
 Thompson also arranged that the compiler would recognize when
 it was compiling a version of itself and insert into the
 recompiled compiler the code to insert into the recompiled login
 the code to allow Thompson entry  and of course the code to
 recognize itself and do the whole thing again the next time around
 And having done this once he was then able to recompile the
 compiler from the original sources leaving his back door in place
 and active but with no trace in the sources

 The talk that revealed this truly moby hack was published as
 Reflections on Trusting Trust Communications of the
 ACM 27 8 August 1984 pp 761763

 Syn trap door may also be called a wormhole See also
 iron box cracker worm logic bomb

backbone cabal n A group of largesite administrators who pushed
 through the Great Renaming and reined in the chaos of USENET
 during most of the 1980s The cabal mailing list disbanded in
 late 1988 after a bitter internal catfight but the net hardly
noticed

backbone site n A key USENET and email site one that processes
 a large amount of thirdparty traffic especially if it is the home
 site of any of the regional coordinators for the USENET maps
 Notable backbone sites as of early 1991 include uunet and the
 mail machines at Rutgers University UC Berkeley DECs Western
 Research Laboratories Ohio State University and the University of
 Texas Compare rib site leaf site

backgammon See bignum moby and pseudoprime

background nadjvt To do a task in background is to do
 it whenever foreground matters are not claiming your undivided
 attention and to background something means to relegate it to
 a lower priority For now well just print a list of nodes and
 links Im working on the graphprinting problem in background
 Note that this implies ongoing activity but at a reduced level or
 in spare time in contrast to mainstream back burner which
 connotes benign neglect until some future resumption of activity
 Some people prefer to use the term for processing that they have
 queued up for their unconscious minds a tack that one can often
 fruitfully take upon encountering an obstacle in creative work
 Compare amp off slopsucker

 Technically a task running in background is detached from the
 terminal where it was started and often running at a lower
 priority oppose foreground Nowadays this term is primarily
 associated with UNIX but it appears to have been first used
 in this sense on OS360

backspace and overstrike interj Whoa Back up Used to suggest
 that someone just said or did something wrong Common among
 APL programmers

backward combatability bakwrd kmbatbiltee from
 backward compatibility n A property of hardware or software
 revisions in which previous protocols formats and layouts are
 discarded in favor of new and improved protocols formats and

 releases When the change is so drastic that the old formats are
 not retained in the new version it is said to be backward
 combatable See flag day

BAD BAD IBM acronym Broken As Designed adj Said
 of a program that is bogus because of bad design and misfeatures
 rather than because of bugginess See working as designed

Bad Thing from the 1930 Sellar  Yeatman parody 1066 And
 All That n Something that cant possibly result in improvement
 of the subject This term is always capitalized as in Replacing
 all of the 9600baud modems with bicycle couriers would be a Bad
 Thing Oppose Good Thing British correspondents confirm
 that Bad Thing and Good Thing and prob therefore Right
 Thing and Wrong Thing come from the book referenced in the
 etymology which discusses rulers who were Good Kings but Bad
 Things This has apparently created a mainstream idiom on the
 British side of the pond

bag on the side n An extension to an established hack that is
 supposed to add some functionality to the original Usually
 derogatory implying that the original was being overextended and
 should have been thrown away and the new product is ugly
 inelegant or bloated Also v phrase to hang a bag on the side
 of C Thats just a bag on the side of C 
 They want me to hang a bag on the side of the accounting
 system

bagbiter bagbitr n 1 Something such as a program or a
 computer that fails to work or works in a remarkably clumsy
 manner This text editor wont let me make a file with a line
 longer than 80 characters What a bagbiter 2 A person who has
 caused you some trouble inadvertently or otherwise typically by
 failing to program the computer properly Synonyms loser
 cretin chomper 3 adj bagbiting Having the
 quality of a bagbiter This bagbiting system wont let me
 compute the factorial of a negative number Compare losing
 cretinous bletcherous barfucious under
 barfulous and chomping under chomp 4 bite
 the bag vi To fail in some manner The computer keeps crashing
 every 5 minutes Yes the disk controller is really biting the
 bag The original loading of these terms was almost undoubtedly
 obscene possibly referring to the scrotum but in their current
 usage they have become almost completely sanitized

 A program called Lexiphage on the old MIT AI PDP10 would draw on
 a selected victims bitmapped terminal the words THE BAG in
 ornate letters and then a pair of jaws biting pieces of it off
 This is the first and to date only known example of a program
 intended to be a bagbiter

bamf bamf 1 from old XMen comics interj Notional sound
 made by a person or object teleporting in or out of the hearers
 vicinity Often used in virtual reality esp MUD
 electronic fora when a character wishes to make a dramatic
 entrance or exit 2 The sound of magical transformation used in
 virtual reality fora like sense 1 3 from Don
 Washingtons Survival Guide n Acronym for BadAss Mother
 Fucker used to refer to one of the handful of nastiest monsters
 on an LPMUD or other similar MUD

banana label n The labels often used on the sides of macrotape
 reels so called because they are shaped roughly like bluntended
 bananas This term like macrotapes themselves is still current
 but visibly headed for obsolescence

banana problem n from the story of the little girl who said I
 know how to spell banana but I dont know when to stop Not
 knowing where or when to bring a production to a close compare
 fencepost error One may say there is a banana problem of an
 algorithm with poorly defined or incorrect termination conditions
 or in discussing the evolution of a design that may be succumbing
 to featuritis see also creeping elegance creeping

bandwidth n 1 Used by hackers in a generalization of its
 technical meaning as the volume of information per unit time that a
 computer person or transmission medium can handle Those are
 amazing graphics but I missed some of the detail  not enough
 bandwidth I guess Compare lowbandwidth 2 Attention
 span 3 On USENET a measure of network capacity that is
 often wasted by people complaining about how items posted by others
 are a waste of bandwidth

bang 1 n Common spoken name for  ASCII 0100001
 especially when used in pronouncing a bang path in spoken
 hackish In elder days this was considered a CMUish usage
 with MIT and Stanford hackers preferring excl or shriek
 but the spread of UNIX has carried bang with it esp via the
 term bang path and it is now certainly the most common spoken
 name for  Note that it is used exclusively for
 nonemphatic written  one would not say Congratulations
 bang except possibly for humorous purposes but if one wanted
 to specify the exact characters foo one would speak Eff oh oh
 bang See shriek ASCII 2 interj An exclamation
 signifying roughly I have achieved enlightenment or The
 dynamite has cleared out my brain Often used to acknowledge
 that one has perpetrated a thinko immediately after one has
 been called on it

bang on vt To stresstest a piece of hardware or software I
 banged on the new version of the simulator all day yesterday and it
 didnt crash once I guess it is ready for release The term
 pound on is synonymous

bang path n An oldstyle UUCP electronicmail address specifying
 hops to get from some assumedreachable location to the addressee
 so called because each hop is signified by a bang sign
 Thus for example the path bigsitefoovaxbarboxme
 directs people to route their mail to machine bigsite presumably
 a wellknown location accessible to everybody and from there
 through the machine foovax to the account of user me on
 barbox

 In the bad old days of not so long ago before autorouting mailers
 became commonplace people often published compound bang addresses
 using the   convention see glob to give paths from
 several big machines in the hopes that ones correspondent
 might be able to get mail to one of them reliably example
 seismo utsally ihnp4ricebetagammame Bang paths
 of 8 to 10 hops were not uncommon in 1981 Latenight dialup
 UUCP links would cause weeklong transmission times Bang paths
 were often selected by both transmission time and reliability as
 messages would often get lost See Internet address
 network the and sitename

banner n 1 The title page added to printouts by most print
 spoolers see spool Typically includes user or account ID
 information in very large charactergraphics capitals Also called
 a burst page because it indicates where to burst tear apart
 fanfold paper to separate one users printout from the next 2 A
 similar printout generated typically on multiple pages of fanfold
 paper from userspecified text eg by a program such as UNIXs
 banner16 3 On interactive software a first screen
 containing a logo andor author credits andor a copyright notice

bar bar n 1 The second metasyntactic variable after foo
 and before baz Suppose we have two functions FOO and BAR
 FOO calls BAR 2 Often appended to foo to produce
 foobar

bare metal n 1 New computer hardware unadorned with such
 snares and delusions as an operating system an HLL or
 even assembler Commonly used in the phrase programming on the
 bare metal which refers to the arduous work of bit bashing
 needed to create these basic tools for a new machine Real
 baremetal programming involves things like building boot proms and
 BIOS chips implementing basic monitors used to test device
 drivers and writing the assemblers that will be used to write the
 compiler back ends that will give the new machine a real
 development environment 2 Programming on the bare metal is
 also used to describe a style of handhacking that relies on
 bitlevel peculiarities of a particular hardware design esp
 tricks for speed and space optimization that rely on crocks such as
 overlapping instructions or as in the famous case described in
 The Story of Mel a Real Programmer in appendix A
 interleaving of opcodes on a magnetic drum to minimize fetch delays
 due to the devices rotational latency This sort of thing has
 become less common as the relative costs of programming time and
 machine resources have changed but is still found in heavily
 constrained environments such as industrial embedded systems See
 real programmer

 In the world of personal computing bare metal programming
 especially in sense 1 but sometimes also in sense 2 is often
 considered a Good Thing or at least a necessary evil
 because these machines have often been sufficiently slow and
 poorly designed to make it necessary see illbehaved
 There the term usually refers to bypassing the BIOS or OS
 interface and writing the application to directly access device
 registers and machine addresses To get 192 kilobaud on the
 serial port you need to get down to the bare metal People who
 can do this sort of thing are held in high regard

barf barf from mainstream slang meaning vomit
 1 interj Term of disgust This is the closest hackish
 equivalent of the Valspeak gag me with a spoon Like euwww
 See bletch 2 vi To say Barf or emit some similar
 expression of disgust I showed him my latest hack and he
 barfed means only that he complained about it not that he
 literally vomited 3 vi To fail to work because of unacceptable
 input May mean to give an error message Examples The
 division operation barfs if you try to divide by 0 That is
 the division operation checks for an attempt to divide by zero and
 if one is encountered it causes the operation to fail in some
 unspecified but generally obvious manner The text editor
 barfs if you try to read in a new file before writing out the old
 one See choke gag In Commonwealth hackish
 barf is generally replaced by puke or vom barf
 is sometimes also used as a metasyntactic variable like foo or
 bar

barfmail n Multiple bounce messages accumulating to the
 level of serious annoyance or worse The sort of thing that
 happens when an internetwork mail gateway goes down or
 wonky

barfulation barfyoolayshn interj Variation of barf
 used around the Stanford area An exclamation expressing disgust
 On seeing some particularly bad code one might exclaim
 Barfulation Who wrote this Quux

barfulous barfyools adj alt barfucious
 barfyooshs Said of something that would make anyone barf
 if only for esthetic reasons

barney n In Commonwealth hackish barney is to fred
 sense 1 as bar is to foo That is people who
 commonly use fred as their first metasyntactic variable will
 often use barney second The reference is of course to Fred
 Flintstone and Barney Rubble in the Flintstones cartoons

baroque adj Featureencrusted complex gaudy verging on
 excessive Said of hardware or esp software designs this has
 many of the connotations of elephantine or monstrosity but is
 less extreme and not pejorative in itself Metafont even has
 features to introduce random variations to its letterform output
 Now that is baroque See also rococo

BartleMUD bartlmuhd n Any of the MUDs derived from the
 original MUD game by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw see
 MUD BartleMUDs are noted for their usually slightly
 offbeat humor dry but friendly syntax and lack of adjectives in
 object descriptions so a player is likely to come across
 brand172 for instance see brand brand brand Bartle has
 taken a bad rap in some MUDding circles for supposedly originating
 this term but like the story that MUD is a trademark this
 appears to be a myth he uses MUD1

BASIC n A programming language originally designed for
 Dartmouths experimental timesharing system in the early 1960s
 which has since become the leading cause of braindamage in
 protohackers This is another case like Pascal of the bad
 things that happen when a language deliberately designed as an
 educational toy gets taken too seriously A novice can write short
 BASIC programs on the order of 1020 lines very easily writing
 anything longer is a very painful and b encourages bad habits
 that will bite himher later if heshe tries to hack in a real
 language This wouldnt be so bad if historical accidents hadnt
 made BASIC so common on lowend micros As it is it ruins
 thousands of potential wizards a year

batch adj 1 Noninteractive Hackers use this somewhat more
 loosely than the traditional technical definitions justify in
 particular switches on a normally interactive program that prepare
 it to receive noninteractive command input are often referred to
 as batch mode switches A batch file is a series of
 instructions written to be handed to an interactive program running
 in batch mode 2 Performance of dreary tasks all at one sitting
 I finally sat down in batch mode and wrote out checks for all
 those bills I guess theyll turn the electricity back on next
 week 3 Accumulation of a number of small tasks that can be
 lumped together for greater efficiency Im batching up those
 letters to send sometime Im batching up bottles to take to the
 recycling center

bathtub curve n Common term for the curve resembling an
 endtoend section of one of those clawfooted antique bathtubs
 that describes the expected failure rate of electronics with time
 initially high dropping to near 0 for most of the systems
 lifetime then rising again as it tires out See also burnin
 period infant mortality

baud bawd simplified from its technical meaning n Bits per
 second Hence kilobaud or Kbaud thousands of bits per second
 The technical meaning is level transitions per second this
 coincides with bps only for twolevel modulation with no framing or
 stop bits Most hackers are aware of these nuances but blithely
 ignore them

 Histotical note this was originally a unit of telegraph signalling
 speed set at one pulse per second It was proposed at the
 International Telegraph Conference of 1927 and named after JME
 Baudot 18451903 the French engineer who constructed the first
 successful teleprinter

baud barf bawd barf n The garbage one gets on the monitor
 when using a modem connection with some protocol setting esp
 line speed incorrect or when someone picks up a voice extension
 on the same line or when really bad line noise disrupts the
 connection Baud barf is not completely random by the way
 hackers with a lot of serialline experience can usually tell
 whether the device at the other end is expecting a higher or lower
 speed than the terminal is set to Really experienced ones
 can identify particular speeds

baz baz n 1 The third metasyntactic variable Suppose we
 have three functions FOO BAR and BAZ FOO calls BAR which
 calls BAZ See also fum 2 interj A term of mild
 annoyance In this usage the term is often drawn out for 2 or 3
 seconds producing an effect not unlike the bleating of a sheep
 baaaaaaz 3 Occasionally appended to foo to produce
 foobaz

 Earlier versions of this lexicon derived baz as a Stanford
 corruption of bar However Pete Samson compiler of the
 TMRC lexicon reports it was already current when he joined TMRC
 in 1958 He says It came from Pogo Albert the Alligator
 when vexed or outraged would shout Bazz Fazz or Rowrbazzle
 The club layout was said to model the mythical New England
 counties of Rowrfolk and Bassex Rowrbazzle mingled with
 NorfolkSuffolkMiddlesexEssex

bboard beebord contraction of bulletin board n
 1 Any electronic bulletin board esp used of BBS systems

 newsgroup in fact use of the term for a newsgroup generally
 marks one either as a newbie fresh in from the BBS world or as
 a real oldtimer predating USENET 2 At CMU and other colleges
 with similar facilities refers to campuswide electronic bulletin
 boards 3 The term physical bboard is sometimes used to
 refer to a oldfashioned nonelectronic cork memo board At CMU
 it refers to a particular one outside the CS Lounge

 In either of senses 1 or 2 the term is usually prefixed by the
 name of the intended board the Moonlight Casino bboard or
 market bboard however if the context is clear the betterread
 bboards may be referred to by name alone as in at CMU Dont

BBS BBS abbreviation Bulletin Board System n An electronic
 bulletin board system that is a message database where people can
 log in and leave broadcast messages for others grouped typically
 into topic groups Thousands of local BBS systems are in
 operation throughout the US typically run by amateurs for fun
 out of their homes on MSDOS boxes with a single modem line each
 Fans of USENET and Internet or the big commercial timesharing
 bboards such as CompuServe and GEnie tend to consider local BBSes
 the lowrent district of the hacker culture but they serve a
 valuable function by knitting together lots of hackers and users in
 the personalmicro world who would otherwise be unable to exchange
 code at all

 in a pejorative sense to refer to software that was apparently
 created by rather spacedout hackers late at night to solve some
 unique problem It usually has nonexistent incomplete or

beta bayt bet or Commonwealth beet n 1 In
 the Real World software often goes through two stages of
 testing Alpha inhouse and Beta outhouse Software is said
 to be in beta 2 Anything that is new and experimental is in
 beta His girlfriend is in beta means that he is still testing
 for compatibility and reserving judgment 3 Beta software is
 notoriously buggy so in beta connotes flakiness

 Historical note More formally to betatest is to test a
 prerelease potentially unreliable version of a piece of software
 by making it available to selected customers and users This term
 derives from early 1960s terminology for product cycle checkpoints
 first used at IBM but later standard throughout the industry
 Alpha Test was the unit module or component test phase Beta
 Test was initial system test These themselves came from earlier
 A and Btests for hardware The Atest was a feasibility and
 manufacturability evaluation done before any commitment to design
 and development The Btest was a demonstration that the
 engineering model functioned as specified The Ctest
 corresponding to todays beta was the Btest performed on early
 samples of the production design

bignum bignuhm orig from MIT MacLISP n 1 techspeak A
 multipleprecision computer representation for very large integers
 More generally any very large number Have you ever looked at
 the United States Budget Theres bignums for you
 2 Stanford In backgammon large numbers on the dice are called
 bignums especially a roll of double fives or double sixes
 compare moby sense 4 See also El Camino Bignum

 Sense 1 may require some explanation Most computer languages
 provide a kind of data called integer but such computer
 integers are usually very limited in size usually they must be
 smaller than than 231 2147483648 or on a losing
 bitty box 215 32768 If you want to work with
 numbers larger than that you have to use floatingpoint numbers
 which are usually accurate to only six or seven decimal places
 Computer languages that provide bignums can perform exact
 calculations on very large numbers such as 1000 the factorial
 of 1000 which is 1000 times 999 times 998 times  times 2
 times 1 For example this value for 1000 was computed by the
 MacLISP system using bignums

bit from the mainstream meaning and Binary digIT n
 1 techspeak The unit of information the amount of information
 obtained by asking a yesorno question for which the two outcomes
 are equally probable 2 techspeak A computational quantity that
 can take on one of two values such as true and false or 0 and 1
 3 A mental flag a reminder that something should be done
 eventually I have a bit set for you I havent seen you for
 a while and Im supposed to tell or ask you something 4 More
 generally a possibly incorrect mental state of belief I have
 a bit set that says that you were the last guy to hack on EMACS
 Meaning I think you were the last guy to hack on EMACS and what
 I am about to say is predicated on this so please stop me if this
 isnt true

 I just need one bit from you is a polite way of indicating that
 you intend only a short interruption for a question that can
 presumably be answered yes or no

 A bit is said to be set if its value is true or 1 and
 reset or clear if its value is false or 0 One speaks of
 setting and clearing bits To toggle or invert a bit is
 to change it either from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0 See also
 flag trit mode bit

 The term bit first appeared in print in the computerscience
 sense in 1949 and seems to have been coined by early computer
 scientist John Tukey Tukey records that it evolved over a lunch
 table as a handier alternative to bigit or binit

bit bang n Transmission of data on a serial line when
 accomplished by rapidly tweaking a single output bit at the
 appropriate times The technique is a simple
 loop with eight OUT and SHIFT instruction pairs for each byte
 Input is more interesting And full duplex doing input and output
 at the same time is one way to separate the real hackers from the
 wannabees

 Bit bang was used on certain early models of Prime computers
 presumably when UARTs were too expensive and on archaic Z80 micros
 with a Zilog PIO but no SIO In an interesting instance of the
 cycle of reincarnation this technique is now 1991 coming
 back into use on some RISC architectures because it consumes such
 an infinitesimal part of the processor that it actually makes sense
 not to have a UART

bit bashing n alt bit diddling or bit twiddling Term
 used to describe any of several kinds of lowlevel programming
 characterized by manipulation of bit flag nybble
 and other smallerthancharactersized pieces of data these
 include lowlevel device control encryption algorithms checksum
 and errorcorrecting codes hash functions some flavors of
 graphics programming see bitblt and assemblercompiler code
 generation May connote either tedium or a real technical
 challenge more usually the former The command decoding for
 the new tape driver looks pretty solid but the bitbashing for the
 control registers still has bugs See also bit bang
 mode bit

bit bucket n 1 The universal data sink originally the
 mythical receptacle used to catch bits when they fall off the end
 of a register during a shift instruction Discarded lost or
 destroyed data is said to have gone to the bit bucket On
 UNIX often used for devnull Sometimes amplified as
 the Great Bit Bucket in the Sky 2 The place where all lost
 mail and news messages eventually go The selection is performed
 according to Finagles Law important mail is much more likely
 to end up in the bit bucket than junk mail which has an almost
 100 probability of getting delivered Routing to the bit bucket
 is automatically performed by mailtransfer agents news systems
 and the lower layers of the network 3 The ideal location for all
 unwanted mail responses Flames about this article to the bit
 bucket Such a request is guaranteed to overflow ones mailbox
 with flames 4 Excuse for all mail that has not been sent I
 mailed you those figures last week they must have ended in the bit
 bucket Compare black hole

 This term is used purely in jest It is based on the fanciful
 notion that bits are objects that are not destroyed but only
 misplaced This appears to have been a mutation of an earlier term
 bit box about which the same legend was current oldtime
 hackers also report that trainees used to be told that when the CPU
 stored bits into memory it was actually pulling them out of the
 bit box See also chad box

 Another variant of this legend has it that as a consequence of the
 parity preservation law the number of 1 bits that go to the bit
 bucket must equal the number of 0 bits Any imbalance results in
 bits filling up the bit bucket A qualified computer technician
 can empty a full bit bucket as part of scheduled maintenance

bit decay n See bit rot People with a physics background
 tend to prefer this one for the analogy with particle decay See
 also computron quantum bogodynamics

bit rot n Also bit decay Hypothetical disease the existence
 of which has been deduced from the observation that unused programs
 or features will often stop working after sufficient time has
 passed even if nothing has changed The theory explains that
 bits decay as if they were radioactive As time passes the
 contents of a file or the code in a program will become
 increasingly garbled

 There actually are physical processes that produce such effects
 alpha particles generated by trace radionuclides in ceramic chip
 packages for example can change the contents of a computer memory
 unpredictably and various kinds of subtle media failures can
 corrupt files in mass storage but they are quite rare and
 computers are built with errordetecting circuitry to compensate
 for them The notion long favored among hackers that cosmic
 rays are among the causes of such events turns out to be a myth
 see the cosmic rays entry for details

 The term software rot is almost synonymous Software rot is
 the effect bit rot the notional cause

bit twiddling n 1 pejorative An exercise in tuning see
 tune in which incredible amounts of time and effort go to
 produce little noticeable improvement often with the result that
 the code has become incomprehensible 2 Aimless small
 modification to a program esp for some pointless goal
 3 Approx syn for bit bashing esp used for the act of
 frobbing the device control register of a peripheral in an attempt
 to get it back to a known state

bitpaired keyboard n obs alt bitshift keyboard A
 nonstandard keyboard layout that seems to have originated with the
 Teletype ASR33 and remained common for several years on early
 computer equipment The ASR33 was a mechanical device see
 EOU so the only way to generate the character codes from
 keystrokes was by some physical linkage The design of the ASR33
 assigned each character key a basic pattern that could be modified
 by flipping bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL key was pressed In
 order to avoid making the thing more of a Rube Goldberg kluge than
 it already was the design had to group characters that shared the
 same basic bit pattern on one key

 Looking at the ASCII chart we find

 high low bits
 bits 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001
 010         
 011 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

 This is why the characters  appear where they do on a
 Teletype thankfully they didnt use shift0 for space This was
 not the weirdest variant of the QWERTY layout widely
 seen by the way that prize should probably go to one of several
 differing arrangements on IBMs even clunkier 026 and 029 card
 punches

 When electronic terminals became popular in the early 1970s there
 was no agreement in the industry over how the keyboards should be
 laid out Some vendors opted to emulate the Teletype keyboard
 while others used the flexibility of electronic circuitry to make
 their product look like an office typewriter These alternatives
 became known as bitpaired and typewriterpaired keyboards To
 a hacker the bitpaired keyboard seemed far more logical  and
 because most hackers in those days had never learned to touchtype
 there was little pressure from the pioneering users to adapt
 keyboards to the typewriter standard

 The doom of the bitpaired keyboard was the largescale
 introduction of the computer terminal into the normal office
 environment where outandout technophobes were expected to use
 the equipment The typewriterpaired standard became universal
 bitpaired hardware was quickly junked or relegated to dusty
 corners and both terms passed into disuse

bitblt bitblit n from BLT qv 1 Any of a family
 of closely related algorithms for moving and copying rectangles of
 bits between main and display memory on a bitmapped device or
 between two areas of either main or display memory the requirement

 destination rectangles is what makes BitBlt tricky 2 Synonym
 for blit or BLT Both uses are borderline techspeak

blinkenlights blinknlitz n Frontpanel diagnostic lights
 on a computer esp a dinosaur Derives from the last word
 of the famous blackletterGothic sign in mangled pseudoGerman that
 once graced about half the computer rooms in the Englishspeaking

 This silliness dates back at least as far as 1959 at Stanford
 University and had already gone international by the early 1960s
 when it was reported at London Universitys ATLAS computing site
 There are several variants of it in circulation some of which
 actually do end with the word blinkenlights

 In an amusing example of turnaboutisfairplay German hackers
 have developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster in
 fractured English one of which is reproduced here

 personalpart  name  initial 

 namepart  personalpart lastname jrpart EOL
  personalpart namepart

 an initial followed by a dot A namepart consists of either a
 personalpart followed by a last name followed by an optional
 jrpart Jr Sr or dynastic number and endofline or a
 personal part followed by a name part this rule illustrates the
 use of recursion in BNFs covering the case of people who use
 multiple first and middle names andor initials A street address
 consists of an optional apartment specifier followed by a street
 number followed by a street name A zippart consists of a
 townname followed by a comma followed by a state code followed
 by a ZIPcode followed by an endofline Note that many things
 such as the format of a personalpart apartment specifier or
 ZIPcode are left unspecified These are presumed to be obvious
 from context or detailed somewhere nearby See also parse

 The bogon has become the type case for a whole bestiary of nonce
 particle names including the clutron or cluon indivisible
 particle of cluefulness obviously the antiparticle of the bogon
 and the futon elementary particle of randomness These are
 not so much live usages in themselves as examples of a live
 metausage that is it has become a standard joke or linguistic
 maneuver to explain otherwise mysterious circumstances by inventing
 nonce particle names And these imply nonce particle theories with
 all their dignity or lack thereof we might note parenthetically that
 this is a generalization from bogus particle theories to bogus
 particle theories Perhaps such particles are the modernday
 equivalents of trolls and woodnymphs as standard startingpoints
 around which to construct explanatory myths Of course playing on
 an existing word as in the futon yields additional flavor

 bogus At CMU bogosity is measured with a bogometer in
 a seminar when a speaker says something bogus a listener might
 raise his hand and say My bogometer just triggered More
 extremely You just pinned my bogometer means you just said or
 did something so outrageously bogus that it is off the scale
 pinning the bogometer needle at the highest possible reading one

 Historical note The microLenat was invented as an attack against
 noted computer scientist Doug Lenat by a tenured graduate
 student Doug had failed the student on an important exam for
 giving only AI is bogus as his answer to the questions The
 slur is generally considered unmerited but it has become a running
 gag nevertheless Some of Dougs friends argue that of
 course a microLenat is bogus since it is only one millionth of a
 Lenat Others have suggested that the unit should be redesignated
 after the grad student as the microReid

 It is claimed that bogus was originally used in the hackish sense
 at Princeton in the late 1960s It was spread to CMU and Yale by
 Michael Shamos a migratory Princeton alumnus A glossary of bogus
 words was compiled at Yale when the word was first popularized see
 autobogotiphobia under bogotify The word spread into
 hackerdom from CMU and MIT By the early 1980s it was also
 current in something like the hackish sense in West Coast teen
 slang and it had gone mainstream by 1985 A correspondent from
 Cambridge reports by contrast that these uses of bogus grate on
 British nerves in Britain the word means rather specifically
 counterfeit as in a bogus 10pound note

boot techspeak from by ones bootstraps vn To load and
 initialize the operating system on a machine This usage is no
 longer jargon having passed into techspeak but has given rise to
 some derivatives that are still jargon

 The derivative reboot implies that the machine hasnt been
 down for long or that the boot is a bounce intended to clear
 some state of wedgitude This is sometimes used of human
 thought processes as in the following exchange Youve lost
 me OK reboot Heres the theory

 This term is also found in the variants cold boot from
 poweroff condition and warm boot with the CPU and all
 devices already powered up as after a hardware reset or software
 crash

 Another variant soft boot reinitialization of only part of a
 system under control of other software still running If
 youre running the messdos emulator controlaltinsert will
 cause a softboot of the emulator while leaving the rest of the
 system running

 Opposed to this there is hard boot which connotes hostility
 towards or frustration with the machine being booted Ill have
 to hardboot this losing Sun I recommend booting it
 hard One often hardboots by performing a power cycle

 Historical note this term derives from bootstrap loader a short
 program that was read in from cards or paper tape or toggled in
 from the front panel switches This program was always very short
 great efforts were expended on making it short in order to
 minimize the labor and chance of error involved in toggling it in
 but was just smart enough to read in a slightly more complex
 program usually from a card or paper tape reader to which it
 handed control this program in turn was smart enough to read the
 application or operating system from a magnetic tape drive or disk
 drive Thus in successive steps the computer pulled itself up
 by its bootstraps to a useful operating state Nowadays the
 bootstrap is usually found in ROM or EPROM and reads the first
 stage in from a fixed location on the disk called the boot
 block When this program gains control it is powerful enough to
 load the actual OS and hand control over to it

bottom feeder n syn for slopsucker derived from the
 fishermans and naturalists term for finny creatures who subsist
 on the primordial ooze

bottomup implementation n Hackish opposite of the techspeak term
 topdown design It is now received wisdom in most
 programming cultures that it is best to design from higher levels
 of abstraction down to lower specifying sequences of action in
 increasing detail until you get to actual code Hackers often find
 especially in exploratory designs that cannot be closely
 specified in advance that it works best to build things in
 the opposite order by writing and testing a clean set of primitive
 operations and then knitting them together

 cost associated with coordinating and then merging their work
 is ON2 that is proportional to the square of N
 The quote is from Fred Brooks a manager of IBMs OS360 project
 and author of The Mythical ManMonth AddisonWesley 1975
 ISBN 0201006502 an excellent early book on software
 engineering The myth in question has been most tersely expressed
 as Programmer time is fungible and Brooks established
 conclusively that it is not Hackers have never forgotten his

BRS BRS n Syn Big Red Switch This abbreviation is
 fairly common online

brute force adj Describes a primitive programming style one in
 which the programmer relies on the computers processing power
 instead of using his or her own intelligence to simplify the
 problem often ignoring problems of scale and applying naive
 methods suited to small problems directly to large ones

 The canonical example of a bruteforce algorithm is associated
 with the traveling salesman problem TSP a classical NPhard
 problem Suppose a person is in say Boston and wishes to drive
 to N other cities In what order should he or she visit
 them in order to minimize the distance travelled The bruteforce
 method is to simply generate all possible routes and compare the
 distances while guaranteed to work and simple to implement this
 algorithm is clearly very stupid in that it considers even
 obviously absurd routes like going from Boston to Houston via San
 Francisco and New York in that order For very small N it
 works well but it rapidly becomes absurdly inefficient when
 N increases for N  15 there are already
 1307674368000 possible routes to consider and for
 N  1000  well see bignum See
 also NP

 A more simpleminded example of bruteforce programming is finding
 the smallest number in a large list by first using an existing
 program to sort the list in ascending order and then picking the
 first number off the front

 Whether bruteforce programming should be considered stupid or not
 depends on the context if the problem isnt too big the extra CPU
 time spent on a bruteforce solution may cost less than the
 programmer time it would take to develop a more intelligent
 algorithm Additionally a more intelligent algorithm may imply
 more longterm complexity cost and bugchasing than are justified
 by the speed improvement

 Ken Thompson coinventor of UNIX is reported to have uttered the
 epigram When in doubt use brute force He probably intended
 this as a ha ha only serious but the original UNIX kernels
 preference for simple robust and portable algorithms over
 brittle smart ones does seem to have been a significant
 factor in the success of that OS Like so many other tradeoffs in
 software design the choice between brute force and complex
 finelytuned cleverness is often a difficult one that requires both
 engineering savvy and delicate esthetic judgment

brute force and ignorance n A popular design technique at many
 software houses  brute force coding unrelieved by any
 knowledge of how problems have been previously solved in elegant
 ways Dogmatic adherence to design methodologies tends to
 encourage it Characteristic of early larval stage
 programming unfortunately many never outgrow it Often
 abbreviated BFI Gak they used a bubble sort Thats strictly
 from BFI Compare bogosity

BSD BSD n abbreviation for Berkeley System Distribution a
 family of UNIX versions for the DEC VAX and PDP11
 developed by Bill Joy and others at Berzerkeley starting
 around 1980 incorporating paged virtual memory TCPIP networking
 enhancements and many other features The BSD versions 41 42
 and 43 and the commercial versions derived from them SunOS
 ULTRIX and Mt Xinu held the technical lead in the UNIX world
 until ATTs successful standardization efforts after about 1986
 and are still widely popular See UNIX USG UNIX

BUAF  abbreviation from the altfanwarlord n Big
 Ugly ASCII Font  a special form of ASCII art Various
 programs exist for rendering text strings into block bloob and
 pseudoscript fonts in cells between four and six character cells
 on a side this is smaller than the letters generated by older
 banner sense 2 programs These are sometimes used to render
 ones name in a sig block and are critically referred to as
 BUAFs See warlording

BUAG  abbreviation from the altfanwarlord n Big
 Ugly ASCII Graphic Pejorative term for ugly ASCII ART
 especially as found in sig blocks For some reason mutations
 of the head of Bart Simpson are particularly common in the least
 imaginative sig blocks See warlording

bubble sort n Techspeak for a particular sorting technique in
 which pairs of adjacent values in the list to be sorted are
 compared and interchanged if they are out of order thus list
 entries bubble upward in the list until they bump into one with a
 lower sort value Because it is not very good relative to other
 methods and is the one typically stumbled on by naive and
 untutored programmers hackers consider it the canonical
 example of a naive algorithm The canonical example of a really
 bad algorithm is bogosort A bubble sort might be used
 out of ignorance but any use of bogosort could issue only from
 brain damage or willful perversity

bucky bits buhkee bits n 1 obs The bits produced by the
 CONTROL and META shift keys on a SAIL keyboard octal 200 and 400
 respectively resulting in a 9bit keyboard character set The
 MIT AI TV Knight keyboards extended this with TOP and separate
 left and right CONTROL and META keys resulting in a 12bit
 character set later LISP Machines added such keys as SUPER
 HYPER and GREEK see spacecadet keyboard 2 By extension
 bits associated with extra shift keys on any keyboard eg
 the ALT on an IBM PC or command and option keys on a Macintosh

 It is rumored that bucky bits were named for Buckminster Fuller
 during a period when he was consulting at Stanford Actually
 Bucky was Niklaus Wirths nickname when he was at
 Stanford he first suggested the idea of an EDIT key to set the
 8th bit of an otherwise 7bit ASCII character This was used in a
 number of editors written at Stanford or in its environs TVEDIT
 and NLS being the bestknown The term spread to MIT and CMU
 early and is now in general use See double bucky
 quadruple bucky

buffer overflow n What happens when you try to stuff more data
 into a buffer holding area than it can handle This may be due
 to a mismatch in the processing rates of the producing and
 consuming processes see overrun and firehose syndrome
 or because the buffer is simply too small to hold all the data that
 must accumulate before a piece of it can be processed For example
 in a textprocessing tool that crunches a line at a time a
 short line buffer can result in lossage as input from a long
 line overflows the buffer and trashes data beyond it Good
 defensive programming would check for overflow on each character
 and stop accepting data when the buffer is full up The term is
 used of and by humans in a metaphorical sense What time did I
 agree to meet you My buffer must have overflowed Or If I
 answer that phone my buffer is going to overflow See also
 spam overrun screw

bug n An unwanted and unintended property of a program or piece
 of hardware esp one that causes it to malfunction Antonym of
 feature Examples Theres a bug in the editor it writes
 things out backwards The system crashed because of a hardware
 bug Fred is a winner but he has a few bugs ie Fred is
 a good guy but he has a few personality problems

 Historical note Some have said this term came from telephone
 company usage in which bugs in a telephone cable were blamed
 for noisy lines but this appears to be an incorrect folk
 etymology Admiral Grace Hopper an early computing pioneer better
 known for inventing COBOL liked to tell a story in which a
 technician solved a persistent glitch in the Harvard Mark II
 machine by pulling an actual insect out from between the contacts
 of one of its relays and she subsequently promulgated bug in
 its hackish sense as a joke about the incident though as she was
 careful to admit she was not there when it happened For many
 years the logbook associated with the incident and the actual bug
 in question a moth sat in a display case at the Naval Surface
 Warfare Center The entire story with a picture of the logbook
 and the moth taped into it is recorded in the Annals of the
 History of Computing Vol 3 No 3 July 1981 pp 285286

 The text of the log entry from September 9 1945 reads 1545
 Relay 70 Panel F moth in relay First actual case of bug being
 found This wording seems to establish that the term was already
 in use at the time in its current specific sense  and Hopper
 herself reports that the term bug was regularly applied to
 problems in radar electronics during WWII Indeed the use of
 bug to mean an industrial defect was already established in
 Thomas Edisons time and bug in the sense of an disruptive
 event goes back to Shakespeare In the first edition of Samuel
 Johnsons dictionary one meaning of bug is A frightful
 object a walking spectre this is traced to bugbear a Welsh
 term for a variety of mythological monster which to complete the
 circle has recently been reintroduced into the popular lexicon
 through fantasy roleplaying games

 In any case in jargon the word almost never refers to insects
 Here is a plausible conversation that never actually happened

 There is a bug in this ant farm

 What do you mean I dont see any ants in it

 Thats the bug

 There has been a widespread myth that the original bug was moved
 to the Smithsonian and an earlier version of this entry so
 asserted A correspondent who thought to check discovered that the
 bug was not there While investigating this in late 1990 your
 editor discovered that the NSWC still had the bug but had
 unsuccessfully tried to get the Smithsonian to accept it  and
 that the present curator of their History of American Technology
 Museum didnt know this and agreed that it would make a worthwhile
 exhibit It was moved to the Smithsonian in mid1991 Thus the
 process of investigating the originalcomputerbug bug fixed it in
 an entirely unexpected way by making the myth true  ESR

 1992 update the plot thickens A usually reliable source reports
 having seen The Bug at the Smithsonian in 1978 I am unable to
 reconcile the conflicting histories I have been offered and merely
 report this fact here  ESR

bugcompatible adj Said of a design or revision that has been
 badly compromised by a requirement to be compatible with
 fossils or misfeatures in other programs or esp
 previous releases of itself MSDOS 20 used  as a path
 separator to be bugcompatible with some cretins choice of  as an
 option character in 10

bugforbug compatible n Same as bugcompatible with the
 additional implication that much tedious effort went into ensuring
 that each known bug was replicated

 extremely robust lossageresistant capable of correctly
 recovering from any imaginable exception condition This is a rare

bum 1 vt To make highly efficient either in time or space
 often at the expense of clarity I managed to bum three more
 instructions out of that code I spent half the night bumming
 the interrupt code In elder days John McCarthy inventor
 of LISP used to compare some efficiencyobsessed hackers
 among his students to ski bums thus optimization became
 program bumming and eventually just bumming 2 To
 squeeze out excess to remove something in order to improve
 whatever it was removed from without changing function this
 distinguishes the process from a featurectomy 3 n A small
 change to an algorithm program or hardware device to make it more
 efficient This hardware bum makes the jump instruction
 faster Usage now uncommon largely superseded by v tune
 and n tweak hack though none of these exactly
 capture sense 2 All these uses are rare in Commonwealth hackish
 because in the parent dialects of English bum is a rude synonym
 for buttocks

bump vt Synonym for increment Has the same meaning as
 Cs  operator Used esp of counter variables pointers and
 index dummies in for while and dowhile
 loops

burble from Lewis Carrolls Jabberwocky v Like flame

 mere flamers can be competent A term of deep contempt
 Theres some guy on the phone burbling about how he got a DISK
 FULL error and its all our comm softwares fault

buried treasure n A surprising piece of code found in some
 program While usually not wrong it tends to vary from crufty
 to bletcherous and has lain undiscovered only because it was
 functionally correct however horrible it is Used sarcastically
 because what is found is anything but treasure Buried
 treasure almost always needs to be dug up and removed I just
 found that the scheduler sorts its queue using bubble sort

 using a computer is so intensely involved in his project that he
 forgets basic needs such as food drink sleep etc Warning
 Excessive burnin can lead to burnout See hack mode

busywait vi Used of human behavior conveys that the subject is
 busy waiting for someone or something intends to move instantly as
 soon as it shows up and thus cannot do anything else at the
 moment Cant talk now Im busywaiting till Bill gets off the
 phone

 Technically busywait means to wait on an event by
 spinning through a tight or timeddelay loop that polls for
 the event on each pass as opposed to setting up an interrupt
 handler and continuing execution on another part of the task This
 is a wasteful technique best avoided on timesharing systems where
 a busywaiting program may hog the processor

buzz vi 1 Of a program to run with no indication of progress
 and perhaps without guarantee of ever finishing esp said of
 programs thought to be executing tight loops of code A program
 that is buzzing appears to be catatonic but you never get out
 of catatonia while a buzzing loop may eventually end of its own
 accord The program buzzes for about 10 seconds trying to sort
 all the names into order See spin see also grovel
 2 ETA Systems To test a wire or printed circuit trace for
 continuity by applying an AC rather than DC signal Some wire
 faults will pass DC tests but fail a buzz test 3 To process an
 array or list in sequence doing the same thing to each element

 percentage of buzzwords in a speech or documents Usually roughly
 proportional to bogosity See TLA

 trivial andor tedious one that ought to be performed
 automatically by the computer but which a hacker instead has to
 step tediously through My mailer doesnt have a command to
 include the text of the message Im replying to so I have to do it
 by hand This does not necessarily mean the speaker has to
 retype a copy of the message it might refer to say dropping into
 a subshell from the mailer making a copy of ones mailbox file
 reading that into an editor locating the top and bottom of the
 message in question deleting the rest of the file inserting 
 characters on each line writing the file leaving the editor
 returning to the mailer reading the file in and later remembering
 to delete the file Compare eyeball search

byte bit techspeak n A unit of memory or data equal to
 the amount used to represent one character on modern architectures
 this is usually 8 bits but may be 9 on 36bit machines Some
 older architectures used byte for quantities of 6 or 7 bits and
 the PDP10 supported bytes that were actually bitfields of
 1 to 36 bits These usages are now obsolete and even 9bit bytes
 have become rare in the general trend toward powerof2 word sizes

 Historical note The term originated in 1956 during the early
 design phase for the IBM Stretch computer originally it was
 described as 1 to 6 bits typical IO equipment of the period
 used 6bit chunks of information The move to an 8bit byte
 happened in late 1956 and this size was later adopted and
 promulgated as a standard by the System360 The term byte was
 coined by mutating the word bite so it would not be accidentally
 misspelled as bit See also nybble

bytesexual bitsekshul adj Said of hardware denotes
 willingness to compute or pass data in either bigendian or
 littleendian format depending presumably on a mode bit
 somewhere See also NUXI problem

 C 


C n 1 The third letter of the English alphabet 2 ASCII
 1000011 3 The name of a programming language designed by
 Dennis Ritchie during the early 1970s and immediately used to
 reimplement UNIX so called because many features derived
 from an earlier compiler named B in commemoration of
 its parent BCPL Before Bjarne Stroustrup settled the
 question by designing C there was a humorous debate over whether
 Cs successor should be named D or P C became immensely
 popular outside Bell Labs after about 1980 and is now the dominant
 language in systems and microcomputer applications programming
 See also languages of choice indent style

 C is often described with a mixture of fondness and disdain
 varying according to the speaker as a language that combines
 all the elegance and power of assembly language with all the
 readability and maintainability of assembly language

C Programmers Disease n The tendency of the undisciplined C
 programmer to set arbitrary but supposedly generous static limits
 on table sizes defined if youre lucky by constants in header
 files rather than taking the trouble to do proper dynamic storage
 allocation If an application user later needs to put 68 elements
 into a table of size 50 the afflicted programmer reasons that he
 can easily reset the table size to 68 or even as much as 70 to
 allow for future expansion and recompile This gives the
 programmer the comfortable feeling of having done his bit to
 satisfy the users unreasonable demands and often affords the
 user multiple opportunities to explore the marvelous consequences
 of fandango on core In severe cases of the disease the
 programmer cannot comprehend why each fix of this kind seems only
 to further disgruntle the user

calculator Cambridge n Syn for bitty box

can vt To abort a job on a timesharing system Used esp when the
 person doing the deed is an operator as in canned from the
 console Frequently used in an imperative sense as in Can
 that print job the LPT just popped a sprocket Synonymous with
 gun It is said that the ASCII character with mnemonic CAN
 0011000 was used as a killjob character on some early OSes

cant happen The traditional program comment for code executed
 under a condition that should never be true for example a file
 size computed as negative Often such a condition being true
 indicates data corruption or a faulty algorithm it is almost
 always handled by emitting a fatal error message and terminating or
 crashing since there is little else that can be done This is
 also often the text emitted if the impossible error actually
 happens Although cant happen events are genuinely infrequent
 in production code programmers wise enough to check for them
 habitually are often surprised at how often they are triggered
 during development and how many headaches checking for them turns
 out to head off

candygrammar n A programminglanguage grammar that is mostly
 syntactic sugar the term is also a play on candygram
 COBOL Apples Hypertalk language and a lot of the socalled
 4GL database languages are like this The usual intent of such
 designs is that they be as Englishlike as possible on the theory
 that they will then be easier for unskilled people to program
 This intention comes to grief on the reality that syntax isnt what
 makes programming hard its the mental effort and organization
 required to specify an algorithm precisely that costs Thus the
 invariable result is that candygrammar languages are just as
 difficult to program in as terser ones and far more painful for
 the experienced hacker

 The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live
 should not be overlooked This was a Jaws parody
 Someone lurking outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus
 ways to get the occupant to open up while ominous music plays in
 the background The last attempt is a halfhearted Candygram
 When the door is opened a shark bursts in and chomps the poor
 occupant There is a moral here for those attracted to
 candygrammars Note that in many circles pretty much the same
 ones who remember Monty Python sketches all it takes is the word
 Candygram suitably timed to get people rolling on the
 floor  GLS

canonical historically according to religious law adj The
 usual or standard state or manner of something This word has a
 somewhat more technical meaning in mathematics Two formulas such
 as 9  x and x  9 are said to be equivalent because
 they mean the same thing but the second one is in canonical
 form because it is written in the usual way with the highest
 power of x first Usually there are fixed rules you can use
 to decide whether something is in canonical form The jargon
 meaning a relaxation of the technical meaning acquired its
 present loading in computerscience culture largely through its
 prominence in Alonzo Churchs work in computation theory and
 mathematical logic see Knights of the Lambda Calculus
 Compare vanilla

 This word has an interesting history Nontechnical academics do
 not use the adjective canonical in any of the senses defined
 above with any regularity they do however use the nouns canon
 and canonicity not canonicalness or canonicality The
 canon of a given author is the complete body of authentic works
 by that author this usage is familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans as
 well as to literary scholars The canon is the body of
 works in a given field eg works of literature or of art or of
 music deemed worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to
 investigate

 The word canon derives ultimately from the Greek
 kanon
 akin to the English cane referring to a reed Reeds were used
 for measurement and in Latin and later Greek the word canon
 meant a rule or a standard The establishment of a canon of
 scriptures within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a
 rule for the religion The above nontechspeak academic usages
 stem from this instance of a defined and accepted body of work
 Alongside this usage was the promulgation of canons rules
 for the government of the Catholic Church The techspeak usages
 according to religious law derive from this use of the Latin
 canon

 Hackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic
 contrast with its historical meaning A true story One Bob
 Sjoberg new at the MIT AI Lab expressed some annoyance at the use
 of jargon Over his loud objections GLS and RMS made a point of
 using it as much as possible in his presence and eventually it
 began to sink in Finally in one conversation he used the word
 canonical in jargonlike fashion without thinking Steele
 Aha Weve finally got you talking jargon too Stallman
 What did he say Steele Bob just used canonical in the
 canonical way

 Of course canonicality depends on context but it is implicitly
 defined as the way hackers normally expect things to be
 Thus a hacker may claim with a straight face that according to
 religious law is not the canonical meaning of canonical

cargo cult programming n A style of incompetent programming
 dominated by ritual inclusion of code or program structures that
 serve no real purpose A cargo cult programmer will usually
 explain the extra code as a way of working around some bug
 encountered in the past but usually neither the bug nor the reason
 the code apparently avoided the bug was ever fully understood
 compare shotgun debugging voodoo programming

 The term cargo cult is a reference to aboriginal religions that
 grew up in the South Pacific after World War II The practices of
 these cults center on building elaborate mockups of airplanes and
 military style landing strips in the hope of bringing the return of
 the godlike airplanes that brought such marvelous cargo during the
 war Hackish usage probably derives from Richard Feynmans
 characterization of certain practices as cargo cult science in
 his book Surely Youre Joking Mr Feynman W W Norton

cascade n 1 A huge volume of spurious errormessage output
 produced by a compiler with poor error recovery This can happen
 when one initial error throws the parser out of synch so that much
 of the remaining program text is interpreted as garbaged or
 illformed 2 A chain of USENET followups each adding some
 trivial variation of riposte to the text of the previous one all
 of which is reproduced in the new message an include war in which
 the object is to create a sort of communal graffito

case and paste from cut and paste n 1 The addition of a new
 feature to an existing system by selecting the code from an
 existing feature and pasting it in with minor changes Common in
 telephony circles because most operations in a telephone switch are
 selected using case statements Leads to software bloat

 In some circles of EMACS users this is called programming by
 MetaW because MetaW is the EMACS command for copying a block of
 text to a kill buffer in preparation to pasting it in elsewhere
 The term is condescending implying that the programmer is acting
 mindlessly rather than thinking carefully about what is required to
 integrate the code for two similar cases

castersup mode IBM n Yet another synonym for broken or
 down Usually connotes a major failure A system hardware or
 software which is down may be already being restarted before
 the failure is noticed whereas one which is casters up is

cat from catenate via UNIX cat1 vt
 1 techspeak To spew an entire file to the screen or some other
 output sink without pause 2 By extension to dump large amounts
 of data at an unprepared target or with no intention of browsing it
 carefully Usage considered silly Rare outside UNIX sites See
 also dd BLT

 Among UNIX fans cat1 is considered an excellent example
 of userinterface design because it outputs the file contents
 without such verbosity as spacing or headers between the files and
 because it does not require the files to consist of lines of text
 but works with any sort of data

 Among UNIXhaters cat1 is considered the canonical
 example of bad userinterface design This because it is more
 often used to blast a file to standard output than to
 concatenate two files The name cat for the former
 operation is just as unintuitive as say LISPs cdr

 Of such oppositions are holy wars made

catatonic adj Describes a condition of suspended animation in
 which something is so wedged or hung that it makes no
 response If you are typing on a terminal and suddenly the
 computer doesnt even echo the letters back to the screen as you
 type let alone do what youre asking it to do then the computer
 is suffering from catatonia possibly because it has crashed
 There I was in the middle of a winning game of nethack and it
 went catatonic on me Aaargh Compare buzz

cd tilde seedee tild vi To go home From the UNIX
 Cshell and Kornshell command cd  which takes
 one HOME By extension may be used with other arguments
 thus over an electronic chat link cd coffee

cdr kudr or kuhdr from LISP vt To skip past the
 first item from a list of things generalized from the LISP
 operation on binary tree structures which returns a list
 consisting of all but the first element of its argument In the
 form cdr down to trace down a list of elements Shall we
 cdr down the agenda Usage silly See also loop through

 Historical note The instruction format of the IBM 7090 that hosted
 the original LISP implementation featured two 15bit fields called
 the address and decrement parts The term cdr was originally
 Contents of Decrement part of Register Similarly car stood
 for Contents of Address part of Register

 The cdr and car operations have since become bases for
 formation of compound metaphors in nonLISP contexts GLS recalls
 for example a programming project in which strings were
 represented as linked lists the getcharacter and skipcharacter
 operations were of course called CHAR and CHDR

chad chad n 1 The perforated edge strips on printer paper after
 they have been separated from the printed portion Also called
 selvage and perf 2 obs The confettilike paper bits punched
 out of cards or paper tape this was also called chaff computer
 confetti and keypunch droppings

 Historical note One correspondent believes chad sense 2
 derives from the Chadless keypunch named for its inventor which
 cut little ushaped tabs in the card to make a hole when the tab
 folded back rather than punching out a circlerectangle it was
 clear that if the Chadless keypunch didnt make them then the
 stuff that other keypunches made had to be chad

chad box n Iron Age card punches contained boxes inside them
 about the size of a lunchbox or in some models a large
 wastebasket that held the chad sense 2 You had to open
 the covers of the card punch periodically and empty the chad box
 The bit bucket was notionally the equivalent device in the CPU
 enclosure which was typically across the room in another great

chain 1 orig from BASICs CHAIN statement vi To hand
 off execution to a child or successor without going through the
 OS command interpreter that invoked it The state of the
 parent program is lost and there is no returning to it Though
 this facility used to be common on memorylimited micros and is
 still widely supported for backward compatibility the jargon usage
 is semiobsolescent in particular most UNIX programmers will
 think of this as an exec Oppose the more modern
 subshell 2 A series of linked data areas within an
 operating system or application Chain rattling is the process
 of repeatedly running through the linked data areas searching for
 one which is of interest to the executing program The implication
 is that there is a very large number of links on the chain

channel IRC n The basic unit of discussion on IRC Once
 one joins a channel everything one types is read by others on that
 channel Channels can either be named with numbers or with strings

check n A hardwaredetected error condition most commonly used
 to refer to actual hardware failures rather than softwareinduced
 traps Eg a parity check is the result of a
 hardwaredetected parity error Recorded here because its often
 humorously extended to nontechnical problems For example the
 term child check has been used to refer to the problems caused
 by a small child who is curious to know what happens when she
 presses all the cute buttons on a computers console of course
 this particular problem could have been prevented with

 gum that does in fact resemble the keys of chiclet keyboards
 Used esp to describe the original IBM PCjr keyboard Vendors
 unanimously liked these because they were cheap and a lot of early
 portable and laptop products got launched using them Customers
 rejected the idea with almost equal unanimity and chiclets are not
 often seen on anything larger than a digital watch any more

chomp vi To lose specifically to chew on something of
 which more was bitten off than one can Probably related to
 gnashing of teeth See bagbiter A hand gesture commonly
 accompanies this To perform it hold the four fingers together
 and place the thumb against their tips Now open and close your
 hand rapidly to suggest a biting action much like what PacMan

 predate that The gesture alone means chomp chomp see
 Verb Doubling in the Jargon
 Construction section of the Prependices The hand may be
 pointed at the object of complaint and for real emphasis you can
 use both hands at once Doing this to a person is equivalent to
 saying You chomper If you point the gesture at yourself it
 is a humble but humorous admission of some failure You might do
 this if someone told you that a program you had written had failed
 in some surprising way and you felt dumb for not having anticipated
 it

Classic C klasik C a play on Coke Classic n The
 C programming language as defined in the first edition of KR
 with some small additions It is also known as KR C The name
 came into use while C was being standardized by the ANSI X3J11
 committee Also C Classic This is sometimes applied
 elsewhere thus X Classic where X  Star Trek referring to the
 original TV series or X  PC referring to IBMs ISAbus machines
 as opposed to the PS2 series This construction is especially
 used of product series in which the newer versions are considered
 serious losers relative to the older ones

clean 1 adj Used of hardware or software designs implies
 elegance in the small that is a design or implementation that
 may not hold any surprises but does things in a way that is
 reasonably intuitive and relatively easy to comprehend from the
 outside The antonym is grungy or crufty 2 v To remove

clobber vt To overwrite usually unintentionally I walked off
 the end of the array and clobbered the stack Compare mung
 scribble trash and smash the stack

clocks n Processor logic cycles so called because each
 generally corresponds to one clock pulse in the processors timing
 The relative execution times of instructions on a machine are
 usually discussed in clocks rather than absolute fractions of a
 second one good reason for this is that clock speeds for various
 models of the machine may increase as technology improves and it
 is usually the relative times one is interested in when discussing
 the instruction set Compare cycle

clone n 1 An exact duplicate Our product is a clone of
 their product Implies a legal reimplementation from
 documentation or by reverseengineering Also connotes lower

 EISAcompatible 80x86based microcomputer this use is sometimes
 spelled klone or PClone These invariably have much
 more bang for the buck than the IBM archetypes they resemble
 5 In the construction UNIX clone An OS designed to deliver
 a UNIXlookalike environment without UNIX license fees or with
 additional missioncritical features such as support for
 realtime programming 6 v To make an exact copy of something

COBOL kohbol COmmon BusinessOriented Language n
 Synonymous with evil A weak verbose and flabby language
 used by card wallopers to do boring mindless things on
 dinosaur mainframes Hackers believe that all COBOL
 programmers are suits or code grinders and no
 selfrespecting hacker will ever admit to having learned the
 language Its very name is seldom uttered without ritual
 expressions of disgust or horror See also fear and loathing
 software rot

COBOL fingers kohbol finggrz n Reported from Sweden a
 hypothetical disease one might get from coding in COBOL The
 language requires code verbose beyond all reason thus it is
 alleged that programming too much in COBOL causes ones fingers to
 wear down to stubs by the endless typing I refuse to type in
 all that source code again it would give me COBOL fingers

code grinder n 1 A suitwearing minion of the sort hired in
 legion strength by banks and insurance companies to implement
 payroll packages in RPG and other such unspeakable horrors In its
 native habitat the code grinder often removes the suit jacket to
 reveal an underplumage consisting of buttondown shirt starch
 optional and a tie In times of dire stress the sleeves if
 long may be rolled up and the tie loosened about half an inch It
 seldom helps The code grinders milieu is about as far from
 hackerdom as one can get and still touch a computer the term
 connotes pity See Real World suit 2 Used of or to a
 hacker a really serious slur on the persons creative ability
 connotes a design style characterized by primitive technique
 ruleboundedness brute force and utter lack of imagination

code police by analogy with George Orwells thought police n
 A mythical team of Gestapolike storm troopers that might burst

 rules May be used either seriously to underline a claim that a
 particular style violation is dangerous or ironically to suggest
 that the practice under discussion is condemned mainly by
 analretentive weenies Dike out that goto or the code

codewalker n A program component that traverses other programs for
 a living Compilers have codewalkers in their front ends so do
 crossreference generators and some database front ends Other
 utility programs that try to do too much with source code may turn
 into codewalkers As in This new vgrind feature would require a
 codewalker to implement

coefficient of X n Hackish speech makes rather heavy use of
 pseudomathematical metaphors Four particularly important ones
 involve the terms coefficient factor index and
 quotient They are often loosely applied to things you
 cannot really be quantitative about but there are subtle
 distinctions among them that convey information about the way the
 speaker mentally models whatever he or she is describing

 Foo factor and foo quotient tend to describe something for
 which the issue is one of presence or absence The canonical
 example is fudge factor Its not important how much youre
 fudging the term simply acknowledges that some fudging is needed
 You might talk of liking a movie for its silliness factor
 Quotient tends to imply that the property is a ratio of two
 opposing factors I would have won except for my luck quotient
 This could also be I would have won except for the luck factor
 but using quotient emphasizes that it was bad luck
 overpowering good luck or someone elses good luck overpowering
 your own

 Foo index and coefficient of foo both tend to imply
 that foo is if not strictly measurable at least something that
 can be larger or smaller Thus you might refer to a paper or
 person as having a high bogosity index whereas you would be less
 likely to speak of a high bogosity factor Foo index suggests
 that foo is a condensation of many quantities as in the mundane
 costofliving index coefficient of foo suggests that foo is a
 fundamental quantity as in a coefficient of friction The choice
 between these terms is often one of personal preference eg some
 people might feel that bogosity is a fundamental attribute and thus
 say coefficient of bogosity whereas others might feel it is a
 combination of factors and thus say bogosity index

COME FROM n A semimythical language construct dual to the go
 to COME FROM label would cause the referenced label to
 act as a sort of trapdoor so that if the program ever reached it
 control would quietly and automagically be transferred to the
 statement following the COME FROM COME FROM was
 first proposed in RL Clarks A Linguistic Contribution to
 GOTOless programming which appeared in a 1973 Datamation
 issue and was reprinted in the April 1984 issue of
 Communications of the ACM This parodied the thenraging
 structured programming holy wars see considered
 harmful Mythically some variants are the assigned COME
 FROM and the computed COME FROM parodying some nasty control
 constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs Of course
 multitasking or nondeterminism could be implemented by having
 more than one COME FROM statement coming from the same
 label

 In some ways the FORTRAN DO looks like a COME FROM
 statement After the terminating statement numberCONTINUE
 is reached control continues at the statement following the DO
 Some generous FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements other than
 CONTINUE for the statement leading to examples like

 DO 10 I1LIMIT
 C imagine many lines of code here leaving the
 C original DO statement lost in the spaghetti
 WRITE610 IFROBI
 10 FORMAT1XI5G104

 in which the trapdoor is just after the statement labeled 10
 This is particularly surprising because the label doesnt appear
 to have anything to do with the flow of control at all

 While sufficiently astonishing to the unsuspecting reader this
 form of COME FROM statement isnt completely general After
 all control will eventually pass to the following statement The
 implementation of the general form was left to Univac FORTRAN
 ca 1975 though a roughly similar feature existed on the IBM 7040
 ten years earlier The statement AT 100 would perform a
 COME FROM 100 It was intended strictly as a debugging aid
 with dire consequences promised to anyone so deranged as to use it
 in production code More horrible things had already been
 perpetrated in production languages however doubters need only
 contemplate the ALTER verb in COBOL

 COME FROM was supported under its own name for the first
 time 15 years later in CINTERCAL see INTERCAL

comment out vt To surround a section of code with comment
 delimiters or to prefix every line in the section with a comment
 marker this prevents it from being compiled or interpreted Often
 done when the code is redundant or obsolete but you want to leave
 it in the source to make the intent of the active code clearer
 also when the code in that section is broken and you want to bypass
 it in order to debug some other part of the code Compare
 condition out usually the preferred technique in languages
 such as C that make it possible

Commonwealth Hackish n Hacker jargon as spoken outside
 the US esp in the British Commonwealth It is reported that
 Commonwealth speakers are more likely to pronounce truncations like
 char and soc etc as spelled char sok as
 opposed to American keir and sohsh Dots in newsgroup
 names tend to be pronounced more often so socwibble is sok dot
 wibl rather than sohsh wibl The prefix meta may be
 pronounced meet similarly Greek letter beta is often
 beet zeta is often zeet and so forth Preferred
 metasyntactic variables include blurgle eek
 ook frodo and bilbo wibble
 wobble and in emergencies wubble banana
 wombat frog fish and so on and on see
 foo sense 4

 Alternatives to verb doubling include suffixes orama
 frenzy as in feeding frenzy and city examples barf
 city hackorama core dump frenzy Finally note
 that the American terms parens brackets and braces for 
  and  are uncommon Commonwealth hackish prefers
 brackets square brackets and curly brackets Also the
 use of pling for bang is common outside the United States

compact adj Of a design describes the valuable property that it
 can all be apprehended at once in ones head This generally means
 the thing created from the design can be used with greater facility
 and fewer errors than an equivalent tool that is not compact
 Compactness does not imply triviality or lack of power for
 example C is compact and FORTRAN is not but C is more powerful
 than FORTRAN Designs become noncompact through accreting
 features and cruft that dont merge cleanly into the
 overall design scheme thus some fans of Classic C maintain
 that ANSI C is no longer compact

compress UNIX vt When used without a qualifier generally
 refers to crunching of a file using a particular
 C implementation of compression by James A Woods et al and

computron kompyootron n 1 A notional unit of computing
 power combining instruction speed and storage capacity dimensioned
 roughly in instructionspersecond times megabytesofmainstore
 times megabytesofmassstorage That machine cant run GNU
 EMACS it doesnt have enough computrons This usage is usually
 found in metaphors that treat computing power as a fungible
 commodity good like a crop yield or diesel horsepower See
 bitty box Get a real computer toy crank
 2 A mythical subatomic particle that bears the unit quantity of
 computation or information in much the same way that an electron
 bears one unit of electric charge see also bogon An
 elaborate pseudoscientific theory of computrons has been developed
 based on the physical fact that the molecules in a solid object
 move more rapidly as it is heated It is argued that an object
 melts because the molecules have lost their information about where
 they are supposed to be that is they have emitted computrons
 This explains why computers get so hot and require air
 conditioning they use up computrons Conversely it should be
 possible to cool down an object by placing it in the path of a
 computron beam It is believed that this may also explain why
 machines that work at the factory fail in the computer room the
 computrons there have been all used up by the other hardware
 This theory probably owes something to the Warlock stories
 by Larry Niven the best known being What Good is a Glass
 Dagger in which magic is fueled by an exhaustible natural
 resource called mana

confuser n Common soundalike slang for computer Usually
 encountered in compounds such as confuser room personal
 confuser confuser guru Usage silly

connector conspiracy probably came into prominence with the
 appearance of the KL10 one model of the PDP10 none of
 whose connectors matched anything else n The tendency of
 manufacturers or by extension programmers or purveyors of
 anything to come up with new products that dont fit together
 with the old stuff thereby making you buy either all new stuff or
 expensive interface devices The KL10 Massbus connector was
 actually patented by DEC which reputedly refused to license
 the design and thus effectively locked third parties out of
 competition for the lucrative Massbus peripherals market This is
 a source of neverending frustration for the diehards who maintain
 older PDP10 or VAX systems Their CPUs work fine but they are
 stuck with dying obsolescent disk and tape drives with low
 capacity and high power requirements

 A closely related phenomenon with a slightly different intent is
 the habit manufacturers have of inventing new screw heads so that
 only Designated Persons possessing the magic screwdrivers can
 remove covers and make repairs or install options The Apple
 Macintosh takes this one step further requiring not only a hex
 wrench but a specialized casecracking tool to open the box

cons konz or kons from LISP 1 vt To add a new element
 to a specified list esp at the top OK cons picking a
 replacement for the console TTY onto the agenda 2 cons up
 vt To synthesize from smaller pieces to cons up an example

 In LISP itself cons is the most fundamental operation for
 building structures It takes any two objects and returns a
 dotpair or twobranched tree with one object hanging from each
 branch Because the result of a cons is an object it can be used
 to build binary trees of any shape and complexity Hackers think
 of it as a sort of universal constructor and that is where the
 jargon meanings spring from

considered harmful adj Edsger W Dijkstras note in the
 March 1968 Communications of the ACM Goto Statement
 Considered Harmful fired the first salvo in the structured
 programming wars Amusingly the ACM considered the resulting
 acrimony sufficiently harmful that it will by policy no longer
 print an article taking so assertive a position against a coding
 practice In the ensuing decades a large number of both serious
 papers and parodies have borne titles of the form X
 considered Y The structuredprogramming wars eventually blew
 over with the realization that both sides were wrong but use of
 such titles has remained as a persistent minor injoke the
 considered silly found at various places in this lexicon is

console n 1 The operators station of a mainframe In
 times past this was a privileged location that conveyed godlike
 powers to anyone with fingers on its keys Under UNIX and other
 modern timesharing OSes such privileges are guarded by passwords

 from Some of the mystique remains however and it is traditional
 for sysadmins to post urgent messages to all users from the console

controlO vi Stop talking From the character used on some
 operating systems to abort output but allow the program to keep on
 running Generally means that you are not interested in hearing
 anything more from that person at least on that topic a standard
 response to someone who is flaming Considered silly Compare
 controlS

controlQ vi Resume From the ASCII DC1 or XON
 character the pronunciation Xon is therefore also used used
 to undo a previous controlS

controlS vi Stop talking for a second From the ASCII DC3
 or XOFF character the pronunciation Xof is therefore also
 used ControlS differs from controlO in that the person is
 asked to stop talking perhaps because you are on the phone but
 will be allowed to continue when youre ready to listen to him 
 as opposed to controlO which has more of the meaning of
 Shut up Considered silly

Conways Law prov The rule that the organization of the software and
 the organization of the software team will be congruent originally
 stated as If you have four groups working on a compiler youll

core n Main storage or RAM Dates from the days of ferritecore
 memory now archaic as techspeak most places outside IBM but also
 still used in the UNIX community and by oldtime hackers or those

cosmic rays n Notionally the cause of bit rot However this is
 a semiindependent usage that may be invoked as a humorous way to
 handwave away any minor randomness that doesnt seem worth the
 bother of investigating Hey Eric  I just got a burst of
 garbage on my tube where did that come from Cosmic rays I
 guess Compare sunspots phase of the moon The British seem
 to prefer the usage cosmic showers alpha particles is also
 heard because stray alpha particles passing through a memory chip
 can cause singlebit errors this becomes increasingly more likely
 as memory sizes and densities increase

 Factual note Alpha particles cause bit rot cosmic rays do not
 except occasionally in spaceborne computers Intel could not
 explain random bit drops in their early chips and one hypothesis
 was cosmic rays So they created the Worlds Largest Lead Safe
 using 25 tons of the stuff and used two identical boards for
 testing One was placed in the safe one outside The hypothesis
 was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit drops they should see
 a statistically significant difference between the error rates on
 the two boards They did not observe such a difference Further
 investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit drops were due
 to alpha particle emissions from thorium and to a much lesser
 degree uranium in the encapsulation material Since it is
 impossible to eliminate these radioactives they are uniformly
 distributed through the earths crust with the statistically
 insignificant exception of uranium lodes it became obvious that
 you have to design memories to withstand these hits

cracker n One who breaks security on a system Coined ca 1985
 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of hacker
 qv sense 8 An earlier attempt to establish worm in this
 sense around 198182 on USENET was largely a failure

 Both these neologisms reflected a strong revulsion against the
 theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings While it is
 expected that any real hacker will have done some playful cracking
 and knows many of the basic techniques anyone past larval
 stage is expected to have outgrown the desire to do so

 Thus there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom
 than the mundane reader misled by sensationalistic journalism
 might expect Crackers tend to gather in small tightknit very
 secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge open
 polyculture this lexicon describes though crackers often like to
 describe themselves as hackers most true hackers consider
 them a separate and lower form of life

 Ethical considerations aside hackers figure that anyone who cant
 imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers than
 breaking into someone elses has to be pretty losing Some
 other reasons crackers are looked down on are discussed in the
 entries on cracking and phreaking See also

cracking n The act of breaking into a computer system what a
 cracker does Contrary to widespread myth this does not
 usually involve some mysterious leap of hackerly brilliance but
 rather persistence and the dogged repetition of a handful of fairly
 wellknown tricks that exploit common weaknesses in the security of
 target systems Accordingly most crackers are only mediocre
 hackers

crank from automotive slang vt Verb used to describe the
 performance of a machine especially sustained performance This
 box cranks or cranks at about 6 megaflops with a burst mode
 of twice that on vectorized operations

crash 1 n A sudden usually drastic failure Most often said
 of the system qv sense 1 esp of magnetic disk drives
 the term originally described what happened when the air gap of a
 Winchester disk collapses Three lusers lost their files
 in last nights disk crash A disk crash that involves the
 readwrite heads dropping onto the surface of the disks and
 scraping off the oxide may also be referred to as a head crash
 whereas the term system crash usually though not always
 implies that the operating system or other software was at fault
 2 v To fail suddenly Has the system just crashed
 Something crashed the OS See down Also used
 transitively to indicate the cause of the crash usually a person
 or a program or both Those idiots playing SPACEWAR
 crashed the system 3 vi Sometimes said of people hitting the
 sack after a long hacking run see gronk out

crash and burn vin A spectacular crash in the mode of the
 conclusion of the carchase scene in the movie Bullitt and
 many subsequent imitators compare die horribly Sun3
 monitors losing the flyback transformer and lightning strikes on
 VAX11780 backplanes are notable crash and burn generators The
 construction crashandburn machine is reported for a computer
 used exclusively for alpha or beta testing or reproducing
 bugs ie not for development The implication is that it
 wouldnt be such a disaster if that machine crashed since only the
 testers would be inconvenienced

crawling horror n Ancient crufty hardware or software that is
 kept obstinately alive by forces beyond the control of the hackers
 at a site Like dusty deck or gonkulator but connotes
 that the thing described is not just an irritation but an active
 menace to health and sanity Mostly we code new stuff in C but
 they pay us to maintain one big FORTRAN II application from
 nineteensixtyX thats a real crawling horror Compare
 WOMBAT

cray kray n 1 properly capitalized One of the line of
 supercomputers designed by Cray Research 2 Any supercomputer at
 all 3 The canonical numbercrunching machine

 The term is actually the lowercased last name of Seymour Cray a
 noted computer architect and cofounder of the company Numerous
 vivid legends surround him some true and some admittedly invented
 by Cray Research brass to shape their corporate culture and image

cray instability n A shortcoming of a program or algorithm that
 manifests itself only when a large problem is being run on a
 powerful machine see cray Generally more subtle than bugs
 that can be detected in smaller problems running on a workstation
 or mini

crayola krayohl n A supermini or micro computer that
 provides some reasonable percentage of supercomputer performance
 for an unreasonably low price Might also be a killer micro

crayon n 1 Someone who works on Cray supercomputers More
 specifically it implies a programmer probably of the CDC ilk
 probably male and almost certainly wearing a tie irrespective of
 gender Systems types who have a UNIX background tend not to be
 described as crayons 2 A computron sense 2 that
 participates only in numbercrunching 3 A unit of
 computational power equal to that of a single Cray1 There is a
 standard joke about this that derives from an old Crayola crayon
 promotional gimmick When you buy 64 crayons you get a free
 sharpener

creationism n The false belief that large innovative software
 designs can be completely specified in advance and then painlessly
 magicked out of the void by the normal efforts of a team of
 normally talented programmers In fact experience has shown
 repeatedly that good designs arise only from evolutionary
 exploratory interaction between one or at most a small handful of
 exceptionally able designers and an active user population 
 and that the first try at a big new idea is always wrong
 Unfortunately because these truths dont fit the planning models
 beloved of management they are generally ignored

creep v To advance grow or multiply inexorably In hackish usage
 this verb has overtones of menace and silliness evoking the
 creeping horrors of lowbudget monster movies

creeping elegance n Describes a tendency for parts of a design to
 become elegant past the point of diminishing return This
 often happens at the expense of the less interesting parts of the
 design the schedule and other things deemed important in the
 Real World See also creeping featurism secondsystem
 effect tense

creeping featurism kreeping feechrizm n 1 Describes a
 systematic tendency to load more chrome and features onto
 systems at the expense of whatever elegance they may have possessed
 when originally designed See also feeping creaturism You
 know the main problem with BSD UNIX has always been creeping
 featurism 2 More generally the tendency for anything
 complicated to become even more complicated because people keep
 saying Gee it would be even better if it had this feature too
 See feature The result is usually a patchwork because it
 grew one adhoc step at a time rather than being planned
 Planning is a lot of work but its easy to add just one extra
 little feature to help someone  and then another  and
 another When creeping featurism gets out of hand its
 like a cancer Usually this term is used to describe computer
 programs but it could also be said of the federal government the
 IRS 1040 form and new cars A similar phenomenon sometimes
 afflicts conscious redesigns see secondsystem effect See
 also creeping elegance

creeping featuritis kreeping feechrits n Variant of
 creeping featurism with its own spoonerization feeping
 creaturitis Some people like to reserve this form for the
 disease as it actually manifests in software or hardware as
 opposed to the lurking general tendency in designers minds
 After all ism means condition or pursuit of whereas
 itis usually means inflammation of

cretin kretn or kreetn n Congenital loser an obnoxious
 person someone who cant do anything right It has been observed
 that many American hackers tend to favor the British pronunciation
 kretn over standard American kreetn it is thought this may
 be due to the insidious phonetic influence of Monty Pythons Flying
 Circus

cretinous kretns or kreetns adj Wrong stupid
 nonfunctional very poorly designed Also used pejoratively of
 people See dread highbit disease for an example
 Approximate synonyms bletcherous bagbiting see
 bagbiter losing braindamaged

crippleware n 1 Software that has some important functionality
 deliberately removed so as to entice potential users to pay for a
 working version 2 Cambridge Guiltware that exhorts you to
 donate to some charity compare careware 3 Hardware
 deliberately crippled which can be upgraded to a more expensive
 model by a trivial change eg cutting a jumper

 An excellent example of crippleware sense 3 is Intels 486SX
 chip which is a standard 486DX chip with the coprocessor
 disabled To upgrade you buy another 486 chip with everything
 but the coprocessor disabled When you put them together
 you have two crippled chips doing the work of one Dont you love
 Intel

critical mass n In physics the minimum amount of fissionable
 material required to sustain a chain reaction Of a software
 product describes a condition of the software such that fixing one
 bug introduces one plus epsilon bugs When software achieves
 critical mass it can only be discarded and rewritten

crlf kerlf sometimes krulf or CRLF n often
 capitalized as CRLF A carriage return CR followed by a line
 feed LF More loosely whatever it takes to get you from the
 end of one line of text to the beginning of the next line See
 newline terpri Under UNIX influence this usage
 has become less common UNIX uses a bare line feed as its CRLF

crock from the obvious mainstream scatologism n 1 An awkward
 feature or programming technique that ought to be made cleaner
 Using small integers to represent error codes without the
 program interpreting them to the user as in for example UNIX
 make1 which returns code 139 for a process that dies due
 to segfault 2 A technique that works acceptably but which
 is quite prone to failure if disturbed in the least for example
 depending on the machine opcodes having particular bit patterns so
 that you can use instructions as data words too a tightly woven
 almost completely unmodifiable structure See kluge
 brittle Also in the adjectives crockish and
 crocky and the nouns crockishness and crockitude

crosspost USENET vi To post a single article simultaneously to
 several newsgroups Distinguished from posting the article
 repeatedly once to each newsgroup which causes people to see it
 multiple times this is very bad form Gratuitous crossposting
 without a FollowupTo line directing responses to a single followup
 group is frowned upon as it tends to cause followup articles
 to go to inappropriate newsgroups when people respond to only one
 part of the original posting

crudware kruhdweir n Pejorative term for the hundreds of
 megabytes of lowquality freeware circulated by users groups
 and BBS systems in the microhobbyist world Yet another
 set of disk catalog utilities for MSDOS What crudware

cruft kruhft backformation from crufty 1 n An
 unpleasant substance The dust that gathers under your bed is
 cruft the TMRC Dictionary correctly noted that attacking it with a
 broom only produces more 2 n The results of shoddy
 construction 3 vt from hand cruft pun on hand craft
 To write assembler code for something normally and better done by
 a compiler see handhacking 4 n Excess superfluous
 junk Esp used of redundant or superseded code

 This term is one of the oldest in the jargon and no one is sure of
 its etymology but it is suggestive that there is a Cruft Hall at
 Harvard University which is part of the old physics building its
 said to have been the physics departments radar lab during WWII
 To this day early 1992 the windows appear to be full of random
 technojunk MIT or Lincoln Labs people may well have coined the
 term as a knock on the competition

cruft together vt also cruft up To throw together
 something ugly but temporarily workable Like vt kluge up
 but more pejorative There isnt any program now to reverse all
 the lines of a file but I can probably cruft one together in about
 10 minutes See hack together hack up kluge up
 crufty

cruftsmanship kruhftsmnship  n from cruft The
 antithesis of craftsmanship

crufty kruhftee origin unknown poss from crusty or
 cruddy adj 1 Poorly built possibly overcomplex The
 canonical example is This is standard old crufty DEC
 software In fact one fanciful theory of the origin of
 crufty holds that was originally a mutation of crusty
 applied to DEC software so old that the s characters were tall
 and skinny looking more like f characters 2 Unpleasant
 especially to the touch often with encrusted junk Like spilled
 coffee smeared with peanut butter and catsup 3 Generally
 unpleasant 4 sometimes spelled cruftie n A small crufty
 object see frob often one that doesnt fit well into the
 scheme of things A LISP property list is a good place to store
 crufties or collectively random cruft

crumb n Two binary digits a quad Larger than a bit
 smaller than a nybble Considered silly Syn tayste

crunch 1 vi To process usually in a timeconsuming or
 complicated way Connotes an essentially trivial operation that is
 nonetheless painful to perform The pain may be due to the
 trivialitys being embedded in a loop from 1 to 1000000000
 FORTRAN programs do mostly numbercrunching 2 vt To
 reduce the size of a file by a complicated scheme that produces bit
 configurations completely unrelated to the original data such as
 by a Huffman code The file ends up looking like a paper document
 would if somebody crunched the paper into a wad Since such
 compression usually takes more computations than simpler methods
 such as runlength encoding the term is doubly appropriate This
 meaning is usually used in the construction file crunching to
 distinguish it from numbercrunching See compress
 3 n The character  Used at XEROX and CMU among other
 places See ASCII 4 vt To squeeze program source into a
 minimumsize representation that will still compile or execute
 The term came into being specifically for a famous program on the
 BBC micro that crunched BASIC source in order to make it run more
 quickly it was a wholly interpretive BASIC so the number of
 characters mattered Obfuscated C Contest entries are often
 crunched see the first example under that entry

cruncha cruncha cruncha kruhnch kruhnch kruhnch interj
 An encouragement sometimes muttered to a machine bogged down in a
 serious grovel Also describes a notional sound made by
 groveling hardware See wugga wugga grind sense 3

cryppie kripee n A cryptographer One who hacks or implements
 cryptographic software or hardware

CTSS CTSS n Compatible TimeSharing System An early
 1963 experiment in the design of interactive timesharing
 operating systems ancestral to Multics UNIX and
 ITS The name ITS Incompatible Timesharing System
 was a hack on CTSS meant both as a joke and to express some basic
 differences in philosophy about the way IO services should be
 presented to user programs

CTY sitee or CTY n MIT The terminal physically
 associated with a computers system console The term is a
 contraction of Console tty that is Console TeleTYpe
 This ITS and TOPS10associated term has become less
 common as most UNIX hackers simply refer to the CTY as the
 console

cube n 1 short for cubicle A module in the openplan
 offices used at many programming shops Ive got the manuals in
 my cube 2 A NeXT machine which resembles a matteblack cube

cubing parallel with tubing vi 1 Hacking on an IPSC Intel
 Personal SuperComputer hypercube Louellas gone cubing

 either physically or mathematically 3 An indescribable form of
 selftorture see sense 1 or 2

cursor dipped in X n There are a couple of metaphors in English
 of the form pen dipped in X perhaps the most common values of X
 are acid bile and vitriol These map over neatly to this
 hackish usage the cursor being what moves leaving letters behind
 when one is composing online Talk about a nastygram He
 mustve had his cursor dipped in acid when he wrote that one

cuspy kuhspee WPI from the DEC abbreviation CUSP for Commonly
 Used System Program ie a utility program used by many people
 adj 1 of a program Wellwritten 2 Functionally excellent A
 program that performs well and interfaces well to users is cuspy
 See rude 3 NYU Said of an attractive woman especially one
 regarded as available Implies a certain curvaceousness

cut a tape vi To write a software or document distribution on
 magnetic tape for shipment Has nothing to do with physically
 cutting the medium Early versions of this lexicon claimed that
 one never analogously speaks of cutting a disk but this has
 since been reported as live usage Related slang usages are
 mainstream businesss cut a check the recording industrys
 cut a record and the militarys cut an order

 All of these usages reflect physical processes in obsolete
 recording and duplication technologies The first stage in
 manufacturing an oldstyle vinyl record involved cutting grooves in
 a stamping die with a precision lathe More mundanely the
 dominant technology for mass duplication of paper documents in
 prephotocopying days involved cutting a stencil punching away
 portions of the wax overlay on a silk screen More directly
 paper tape with holes punched in it was an inportant early storage
 medium

cybercrud siberkruhd coined by Ted Nelson n Obfuscatory
 techtalk Verbiage with a high MEGO factor The computer
 equivalent of bureaucratese

cyberpunk siberpuhnk orig by SF writer Bruce Bethke
 andor editor Gardner Dozois nadj A subgenre of SF launched
 in 1982 by William Gibsons epochmaking novel Neuromancer
 though its roots go back through Vernor Vinges True Names
 see True Names  and Other Dangers in
 appendix C to John Brunners 1975 novel The Shockwave
 Rider Gibsons neartotal ignorance of computers and the
 presentday hacker culture enabled him to speculate about the role
 of computers and hackers in the future in ways hackers have since
 found both irritatingly naive and tremendously stimulating
 Gibsons work was widely imitated in particular by the shortlived
 but innovative Max Headroom TV series See
 cyberspace ice jack in go flatline

cyberspace siberspays n 1 Notional informationspace
 loaded with visual cues and navigable with braincomputer
 interfaces called cyberspace decks a characteristic prop of
 cyberpunk SF At the time of this writing mid1991
 serious efforts to construct virtual reality interfaces
 modeled explicitly on Gibsonian cyberspace are already under way
 using more conventional devices such as glove sensors and binocular
 TV headsets Few hackers are prepared to deny outright the
 possibility of a cyberspace someday evolving out of the network
 see network the 2 Occasionally the metaphoric location
 of the mind of a person in hack mode Some hackers report
 experiencing strong eidetic imagery when in hack mode
 interestingly independent reports from multiple sources suggest
 that there are common features to the experience In particular
 the dominant colors of this subjective cyberspace are often
 gray and silver and the imagery often involves constellations of
 marching dots elaborate shifting patterns of lines and angles or
 moire patterns

cycle 1 n The basic unit of computation What every hacker
 wants more of noted hacker Bill Gosper describes himself as a
 cycle junkie One can describe an instruction as taking so
 many clock cycles Often the computer can access its
 memory once on every clock cycle and so one speaks also of
 memory cycles These are technical meanings of cycle The
 jargon meaning comes from the observation that there are only so
 many cycles per second and when you are sharing a computer the
 cycles get divided up among the users The more cycles the
 computer spends working on your program rather than someone elses
 the faster your program will run Thats why every hacker wants
 more cycles so he can spend less time waiting for the computer to
 respond 2 By extension a notional unit of human thought
 power emphasizing that lots of things compete for the typical
 hackers think time I refused to get involved with the Rubiks
 Cube back when it was big Knew Id burn too many cycles on it if
 I let myself 3 vt Syn bounce 120 reset from the
 phrase cycle power Cycle the machine again that serial ports
 still hung

cycle crunch n A situation where the number of people trying to
 use the computer simultaneously has reached the point where no one
 can get enough cycles because they are spread too thin and the
 system has probably begun to thrash This is an inevitable
 result of Parkinsons Law applied to timesharing Usually the only
 solution is to buy more computer Happily this has rapidly become
 easier in recent years so much so that the very term cycle
 crunch now has a faintly archaic flavor most hackers now use
 workstations or personal computers as opposed to traditional
 timesharing systems

cycle drought n A scarcity of cycles It may be due to a cycle
 crunch but it could also occur because part of the computer is
 temporarily not working leaving fewer cycles to go around
 The high moby is down so were running with only
 half the usual amount of memory There will be a cycle drought
 until its fixed

cycle of reincarnation coined by Ivan Sutherland ca 1970 n
 Term used to refer to a wellknown effect whereby function in a
 computing system family is migrated out to specialpurpose
 peripheral hardware for speed then the peripheral evolves toward
 more computing power as it does its job then somebody notices that
 it is inefficient to support two asymmetrical processors in the
 architecture and folds the function back into the main CPU at
 which point the cycle begins again Several iterations of this
 cycle have been observed in graphicsprocessor design and at least
 one or two in communications and floatingpoint processors Also
 known as the Wheel of Life the Wheel of Samsara and other
 variations of the basic HinduBuddhist theological idea

cycle server n A powerful machine that exists primarily for
 running large batch jobs Implies that interactive tasks such as
 editing are done on other machines on the network such as
 workstations

D C Power Lab n The former site of SAIL Hackers thought
 this was very funny because the obvious connection to electrical
 engineering was nonexistent  the lab was named for a Donald C
 Power Compare Marginal Hacks

daemon daymn or deemn from the mythological meaning
 later rationalized as the acronym Disk And Execution MONitor n
 A program that is not invoked explicitly but lies dormant waiting
 for some conditions to occur The idea is that the perpetrator
 of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is lurking though
 often a program will commit an action only because it knows that it
 will implicitly invoke a daemon For example under ITS
 writing a file on the LPT spoolers directory would invoke the
 spooling daemon which would then print the file The advantage is
 that programs wanting in this example files printed need not
 compete for access to the LPT They simply enter their
 implicit requests and let the daemon decide what to do with them
 Daemons are usually spawned automatically by the system and may
 either live forever or be regenerated at intervals Daemon and
 demon are often used interchangeably but seem to have
 distinct connotations The term daemon was introduced to
 computing by CTSS people who pronounced it deemon and
 used it to refer to what ITS called a dragon Although the
 meaning and the pronunciation have drifted we think this glossary
 reflects current 1991 usage

dangling pointer n A reference that doesnt actually lead
 anywhere in C and some other languages a pointer that doesnt
 actually point at anything valid Usually this is because it
 formerly pointed to something that has moved or disappeared Used
 as jargon in a generalization of its techspeak meaning for
 example a local phone number for a person who has since moved to
 the other coast is a dangling pointer

darkside hacker n A criminal or malicious hacker a
 cracker From George Lucass Darth Vader seduced by the
 dark side of the Force The implication that hackers form a
 sort of elite of technological Jedi Knights is intended Oppose
 samurai

Datamation daytmayshn n A magazine that many hackers
 assume all suits read Used to question an unbelieved quote
 as in Did you read that in Datamation It used to
 publish something hackishly funny every once in a while like the
 original paper on COME FROM in 1973 but it has since become much
 more exclusively suitoriented and boring

day mode n See phase sense 1 Used of people only

dd deedee UNIX from IBM JCL vt Equivalent to
 cat or BLT This was originally the name of a UNIX copy
 command with special options suitable for blockoriented devices
 Often used in heavyhanded system maintenance as in Lets
 dd the root partition onto a tape then use the boot PROM to
 load it back on to a new disk The UNIX dd1 was
 designed with a weird distinctly nonUNIXy keyword option syntax
 reminiscent of IBM System360 JCL which had an elaborate DD Data
 Definition specification for IO devices though the command
 filled a need the interface design was clearly a prank The
 jargon usage is now very rare outside UNIX sites and now nearly
 obsolete even there as dd1 has been deprecated for a
 long time though it has no exact replacement Replaced by
 BLT or simple English copy

DDT DDT n 1 Generic term for a program that assists in
 debugging other programs by showing individual machine instructions
 in a readable symbolic form and letting the user change them In
 this sense the term DDT is now archaic having been widely
 displaced by debugger or names of individual programs like
 dbx adb gdb or sdb 2 ITS Under
 MITs fabled ITS operating system DDT running under the alias
 HACTRN was also used as the shell or top level command
 language used to execute other programs 3 Any one of several
 specific DDTs sense 1 supported on early DEC hardware The DEC
 PDP10 Reference Handbook 1969 contained a footnote on the first
 page of the documentation for DDT which illuminates the origin of
 the term

 Historical footnote DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP1
 computer in 1961 At that time DDT stood for DEC Debugging Tape
 Since then the idea of an online debugging program has propagated
 throughout the computer industry DDT programs are now available
 for all DEC computers Since media other than tape are now
 frequently used the more descriptive name Dynamic Debugging
 Technique has been adopted retaining the DDT abbreviation
 Confusion between DDT10 and another well known pesticide
 dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane C14H9Cl5 should be minimal
 since each attacks a different and apparently mutually exclusive
 class of bugs

 Sadly this quotation was removed from later editions of the
 handbook after the suits took over and DEC became much more
 businesslike

 The history above is known to many oldtime hackers But theres
 more Peter Samson author of the TMRC lexicon reports that
 he named DDT after a similar tool on the TX0 computer the
 direct ancestor of the PDP1 built at MITs Lincoln Lab in 1957
 The debugger on that groundbreaking machine the first
 transistorized computer rejoiced in the name FLIT FLexowriter

 used of hardware 2 At XEROX PARC software that is working but
 not undergoing continued development and support

dead code n Routines that can never be accessed because all calls
 to them have been removed or code that cannot be reached because
 it is guarded by a control structure that provably must always
 transfer control somewhere else The presence of dead code may
 reveal either logical errors due to alterations in the program or
 significant changes in the assumptions and environment of the
 program see also software rot a good compiler should report

deadlock n 1 techspeak A situation wherein two or more
 processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for one of
 the others to do something A common example is a program
 communicating to a server which may find itself waiting for output
 from the server before sending anything more to it while the
 server is similarly waiting for more input from the controlling
 program before outputting anything It is reported that this
 particular flavor of deadlock is sometimes called a starvation
 deadlock though the term starvation is more properly used for
 situations where a program can never run simply because it never
 gets high enough priority Another common flavor is
 constipation where each process is trying to send stuff to
 the other but all buffers are full because nobody is reading
 anything See deadly embrace 2 Also used of
 deadlocklike interactions between humans as when two people meet
 in a narrow corridor and each tries to be polite by moving aside
 to let the other pass but they end up swaying from side to side
 without making any progress because they always both move the same
 way at the same time

deadly embrace n Same as deadlock though usually used only when
 exactly 2 processes are involved This is the more popular term in
 Europe while deadlock predominates in the United States

death code n A routine whose job is to set everything in the
 computer  registers memory flags everything  to zero
 including that portion of memory where it is running its last act
 is to stomp on its own store zero instruction Death code
 isnt very useful but writing it is an interesting hacking
 challenge on architectures where the instruction set makes it
 possible such as the PDP8 it has also been done on the DG Nova
 Death code is much less common and more antisocial on modern
 multiuser machines It was very impressive on earlier hardware
 that provided front panel switches and displays to show register
 and memory contents esp when these were used to prod the corpse
 to see why it died

 Perhaps the ultimate death code is on the TI 990 series where all
 registers are actually in RAM and the instruction store immediate
 0 has the opcode 0 The PC will immediately wrap around core as
 many times as it can until a user hits HALT Any empty memory
 location is death code Worse the manufacturer recommended use of
 this instruction in startup code which would be in ROM and
 therefore survive

Death Star from the movie Star Wars 1 The ATT corporate
 logo which appears on computers sold by ATT and bears an uncanny

 still circulate of a poster printed by Mt Xinu showing a starscape
 with a space fighter labeled 42 BSD streaking away from a broken
 ATT logo wreathed in flames 2 ATTs internal magazine

 percent 2 UNIX A diff especially a diff stored

 Control System or RCS Revision Control System 3 n A small
 quantity but not as small as epsilon The jargon usage of
 delta and epsilon stems from the traditional use of these
 letters in mathematics for very small numerical quantities
 particularly in epsilondelta proofs in limit theory as in the
 differential calculus The term delta is often used once
 epsilon has been mentioned to mean a quantity that is
 slightly bigger than epsilon but still very small The cost
 isnt epsilon but its delta means that the cost isnt totally
 negligible but it is nevertheless very small Common
 constructions include within delta of  within epsilon of

demigod n A hacker with years of experience a national reputation
 and a major role in the development of at least one design tool
 or game used by or known to more than half of the hacker community
 To qualify as a genuine demigod the person must recognizably
 identify with the hacker community and have helped shape it Major
 demigods include Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie coinventors of
 UNIX and C and Richard M Stallman inventor of
 EMACS In their hearts of hearts most hackers dream of
 someday becoming demigods themselves and more than one major
 software project has been driven to completion by the authors
 veiled hopes of apotheosis See also netgod truehacker

 to finish code in time for a demo usually due yesterday
 2 A mode in which video games sit there by themselves running
 through a portion of the game also known as attract mode

 Microsoft Windows opening screen  which lets you impress your
 neighbors without actually having to put up with Microsloth
 Windows

demon n 1 MIT A portion of a program that is not invoked
 explicitly but that lies dormant waiting for some conditions to
 occur See daemon The distinction is that demons are
 usually processes within a program while daemons are usually
 programs running on an operating system Demons are particularly
 common in AI programs For example a knowledgemanipulation
 program might implement inference rules as demons Whenever a new
 piece of knowledge was added various demons would activate which
 demons depends on the particular piece of data and would create
 additional pieces of knowledge by applying their respective
 inference rules to the original piece These new pieces could in
 turn activate more demons as the inferences filtered down through
 chains of logic Meanwhile the main program could continue with
 whatever its primary task was 2 outside MIT Often used
 equivalently to daemon  especially in the UNIX world
 where the latter spelling and pronunciation is considered mildly
 archaic

depeditate deepedtayt by faulty analogy with

deprecated adj Said of a program or feature that is considered
 obsolescent and in the process of being phased out usually in
 favor of a specified replacement Deprecated features can
 unfortunately linger on for many years This term appears with
 distressing frequency in standards documents when the committees
 which write them decide that a sufficient number of users have
 written code which depends on specific features which are out of
 favor

dike vt To remove or disable a portion of something as a wire
 from a computer or a subroutine from a program A standard slogan
 is When in doubt dike it out The implication is that it is
 usually more effective to attack software problems by reducing
 complexity than by increasing it The word dikes is widely
 used among mechanics and engineers to mean diagonal cutters
 esp a heavyduty metalcutting device but may also refer to a
 kind of wirecutters used by electronics techs To dike
 something out means to use such cutters to remove something
 Indeed the TMRC Dictionary defined dike as to attack with
 dikes Among hackers this term has been metaphorically extended
 to informational objects such as sections of code

dinosaurs mating n Said to occur when yet another big iron
 merger or buyout occurs reflects a perception by hackers that
 these signal another stage in the long slow dying of the
 mainframe industry In its glory days of the 1960s it was
 IBM and the Seven Dwarves Burroughs Control Data General
 Electric Honeywell NCR RCA and Univac RCA and GE sold out
 early and it was IBM and the Bunch Burroughs Univac NCR
 Control Data and Honeywell for a while Honeywell was bought out
 by Bull Burroughs merged with Univac to form Unisys in 1984

 this is written early 1991 ATT is attempting to recover from a
 disastrously bad first six years in the hardware industry by
 absorbing NCR More such earthshaking unions of doomed giants
 seem inevitable

dirtball XEROX PARC n A small perhaps struggling outsider
 not in the major or even the minor leagues For example Xerox

 be taken seriously but is far more serious than most jokes
 Consider for example the Fifth Commandment of the Pentabarf from

dongle donggl n 1 A security or copy protection
 device for commercial microcomputer programs consisting of a
 serialized EPROM and some drivers in a D25 connector shell which
 must be connected to an IO port of the computer while the program
 is run Programs that use a dongle query the port at startup and
 at programmed intervals thereafter and terminate if it does not
 respond with the dongles programmed validation code Thus users
 can make as many copies of the program as they want but must pay
 for each dongle The idea was clever but it was initially a
 failure as users disliked tying up a serial port this way Most
 dongles on the market today 1991 will pass data through the port
 and monitor for magic codes and combinations of status lines
 with minimal if any interference with devices further down the line
  this innovation was necessary to allow daisychained dongles
 for multiple pieces of software The devices are still not widely
 used as the industry has moved away from copyprotection schemes
 in general 2 By extension any physical electronic key or
 transferrable ID required for a program to function See
 dongledisk

 Note in early 1992 advertising copy from Rainbow Technologies a
 manufacturer of dongles included a claim that the word derived from
 Don Gall allegedly the inventor of the device The companys
 receptionist will cheerfully tell you that the story is a myth
 invented for the ad copy Nevertheless I expect it to haunt my
 life as a lexicographer for at least the next ten years ESR

dongledisk dongl disk n See dongle a dongledisk
 is a floppy disk which is required in order to perform some task

dot file UNIX n A file which is not visible by default to
 normal directorybrowsing tools on UNIX files named with a
 leading dot are by convention not normally presented in directory
 listings Many programs define one or more dot files in which
 startup or configuration information may be optionally recorded a
 user can customize the programs behavior by creating the
 appropriate file in the current or home directory Therefore dot
 files tend to creep  with every nontrivial application
 program defining at least one a users home directory can be
 filled with scores of dot files of course without the users
 really being aware of it See also rc file

double bucky adj Using both the CTRL and META keys The
 command to burn all LEDs is double bucky F

 This term originated on the Stanford extendedASCII keyboard and
 was later taken up by users of the spacecadet keyboard at
 MIT A typical MIT comment was that the Stanford bucky bits
 control and meta shifting keys were nice but there werent
 enough of them you could type only 512 different characters on a
 Stanford keyboard An obvious way to address this was simply to
 add more shifting keys and this was eventually done but a
 keyboard with that many shifting keys is hard on touchtypists who
 dont like to move their hands away from the home position on the
 keyboard It was halfseriously suggested that the extra shifting
 keys be implemented as pedals typing on such a keyboard would be
 very much like playing a full pipe organ This idea is mentioned
 in a parody of a very fine song by Jeffrey Moss called
 Rubber Duckie which was published in The Sesame
 Street Songbook Simon and Schuster 1971 ISBN 067121036X
 These lyrics were written on May 27 1978 in celebration of the
 Stanford keyboard

down 1 adj Not operating The up escalator is down is
 considered a humorous thing to say and The elevator is down
 always means The elevator isnt working and never refers to
 what floor the elevator is on With respect to computers this
 usage has passed into the mainstream the extension to other kinds
 of machine is still hackish 2 go down vi To stop
 functioning usually said of the system The message from the
 console that every hacker hates to hear from the operator is
 The system will go down in 5 minutes 3 take down

 or PM Im taking the system down to work on that bug in the
 tape drive Occasionally one hears the word down by itself
 used as a verb in this vt sense See crash oppose up

download vt To transfer data or esp code from a larger host
 system esp a mainframe over a digital comm link to a smaller
 client system esp a microcomputer or specialized peripheral
 Oppose upload

 and the reverse upload regardless of the relative size of the
 computers involved So far the inspace machines have invariably
 been smaller thus the uploaddownload distinction has been
 reversed from its usual sense

 terminals displayed a list of people logged in where they were
 what they were running etc along with some random picture such
 as a unicorn Snoopy or the Enterprise which was generated by

dread highbit disease n A condition endemic to PRIME aka
 PR1ME minicomputers that results in all the characters having
 their high 0x80 bit ON rather than OFF This of course makes
 transporting files to other systems much more difficult not to
 mention talking to true 8bit devices Folklore had it that PRIME
 adopted the reversed8bit convention in order to save 25 cents per
 serial line per machine PRIME oldtimers on the other hand claim
 they inherited the disease from Honeywell via customer NASAs
 compatibility requirements and struggled manfully to cure it
 Whoever was responsible this probably qualifies as one of the

drunk mouse syndrome also mouse on drugs n A malady
 exhibited by the mouse pointing device of some computers The
 typical symptom is for the mouse cursor on the screen to move in
 random directions and not in sync with the motion of the actual
 mouse Can usually be corrected by unplugging the mouse and
 plugging it back again Another recommended fix for optical mice
 is to rotate your mouse pad 90 degrees

 At Xerox PARC in the 1970s most people kept a can of copier
 cleaner isopropyl alcohol at their desks When the steel ball on
 the mouse had picked up enough cruft to be unreliable the
 mouse was doused in cleaner which restored it for a while
 However this operation left a fine residue that accelerated the
 accumulation of cruft so the dousings became more and more
 frequent Finally the mouse was declared alcoholic and sent
 to the clinic to be dried out in a CFC ultrasonic bath

Duffs device n The most dramatic use yet seen of fall
 through in C invented by Tom Duff when he was at Lucasfilm
 Trying to bum all the instructions he could out of an inner
 loop that copied data serially onto an output port he decided to
 unroll it He then realized that the unrolled version could
 be implemented by interlacing the structures of a switch and
 a loop

 register n  count  7  8  count  0 assumed 

 switch count  8
 
 case 0 do  to  from
 case 7 to  from
 case 6 to  from
 case 5 to  from
 case 4 to  from
 case 3 to  from
 case 2 to  from
 case 1 to  from
  while n  0

 its most controversial single feature Duff observed that This
 code forms some sort of argument in that debate but Im not sure
 whether its for or against

dumb terminal n A terminal which is one step above a glass tty

 stylistically different This led a number of victims of DWIM to
 claim the acronym stood for Damn Warrens Infernal
 Machine

 In one notorious incident Warren added a DWIM feature to the
 command interpreter used at Xerox PARC One day another hacker
 there typed delete  to free up some disk space The
 editor there named backup files by appending  to the
 original file name so he was trying to delete any backup files
 left over from old editing sessions It happened that there
 werent any editor backup files so DWIM helpfully reported
  not found assuming you meant delete  It then started
 to delete all the files on the disk The hacker managed to stop it
 with a Vulcan nerve pinch after only a half dozen or so files
 were lost

 The hacker later said he had been sorely tempted to go to Warrens
 office tie Warren down in his chair in front of his workstation
 and then type delete  twice

 DWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex
 program it is also occasionally described as the single
 instruction the ideal computer would have Back when proofs of
 program correctness were in vogue there were also jokes about
 DWIMC Do What I Mean Correctly A related term more often
 seen as a verb is DTRT Do The Right Thing see Right

earthquake IBM n The ultimate realworld shock test for
 computer hardware Hackish sources at IBM deny the rumor that the
 Bay Area quake of 1989 was initiated by the company to test
 qualityassurance procedures at its California plants

Easter egg from the custom of the Easter Egg hunt observed in
 the US and many psparts of Europe n 1 A message hidden in the
 object code of a program as a joke intended to be found by persons
 disassembling or browsing the code 2 A message graphic or
 sound effect emitted by a program or on a PC the BIOS ROM in
 response to some undocumented set of commands or keystrokes
 intended as a joke or to display program credits One wellknown
 early Easter egg found in a couple of OSes caused them to respond
 to the command make love with not war Many
 personal computers have much more elaborate eggs hidden in ROM
 including lists of the developers names political exhortations
 snatches of music and in one case graphics images of the entire
 development team

Easter egging IBM n The act of replacing unrelated parts more or
 less at random in hopes that a malfunction will go away Hackers
 consider this the normal operating mode of field circus techs and
 do not love them for it Compare shotgun debugging

eat flaming death imp A construction popularized among hackers by
 the infamous CPU Wars comic supposed to derive from a famously
 turgid line in a WWIIera antiNazi propaganda comic that ran
 Eat flaming death nonAryan mongrels or something of the sort
 however it is also reported that the Firesign Theaters
 1975 album In The Next World Youre On Your Own included the
 phrase Eat flaming death fascist media pigs this may have been
 an influence Used in humorously overblown expressions of
 hostility Eat flaming death EBCDIC users

EBCDIC ebsdik ebseedik or ebkdik abbreviation
 Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code n An alleged
 character set used on IBM dinosaurs It exists in at least six
 mutually incompatible versions all featuring such delights as
 noncontiguous letter sequences and the absence of several ASCII
 punctuation characters fairly important for modern computer
 languages exactly which characters are absent varies according to
 which version of EBCDIC youre looking at IBM adapted EBCDIC
 from punched card code in the early 1960s and promulgated it
 as a customercontrol tactic see connector conspiracy
 spurning the already established ASCII standard Today IBM claims
 to be an opensystems company but IBMs own description of the
 EBCDIC variants and how to convert between them is still internally
 classified topsecret burnbeforereading Hackers blanch at the
 very name of EBCDIC and consider it a manifestation of
 purest evil See also fear and loathing

echo FidoNet n A topic group on FidoNets echomail
 system Compare newsgroup

eightycolumn mind IBM n The sort said to be possessed by
 persons for whom the transition from punched card to tape was
 traumatic nobody has dared tell them about disks yet It is said
 that these people including according to an old joke the founder
 of IBM will be buried face down 9edge first the 9edge being
 the bottom of the card This directive is inscribed on IBMs
 1402 and 1622 card readers and is referenced in a famous bit of
 doggerel called The Last Bug the climactic lines of which
 are as follows

 He died at the console
 Of hunger and thirst
 Next day he was buried
 Face down 9edge first

 The eightycolumn mind is thought by most hackers to dominate IBMs
 customer base and its thinking See IBM fear and
 loathing card walloper

El Camino Bignum el kmeenoh bignuhm n The road
 mundanely called El Camino Real a road through the San Francisco
 peninsula that originally extended all the way down to Mexico City
 and many portions of which are still intact Navigation on the San
 Francisco peninsula is usually done relative to El Camino Real
 which defines logical north and south even though it isnt
 really northsouth many places El Camino Real runs right past
 Stanford University and so is familiar to hackers

 The Spanish word real which has two syllables rayahl
 means royal El Camino Real is the royal road In the FORTRAN
 language a real quantity is a number typically precise to 7
 significant digits and a double precision quantity is a larger
 floatingpoint number precise to perhaps fourteen significant
 digits other languages have similar real types

 When a hacker from MIT visited Stanford in 1976 he remarked what a
 long road El Camino Real was Making a pun on real he started
 calling it El Camino Double Precision  but when the hacker
 was told that the road was hundreds of miles long he renamed it
 El Camino Bignum and that name has stuck See bignum

elder days n The heroic age of hackerdom roughly pre1980 the
 era of the PDP10 TECO ITS and the ARPANET This
 term has been rather consciously adopted from J R R Tolkiens
 fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings Compare Iron Age
 see also elvish

elegant from mathematical usage adj Combining simplicity
 power and a certain ineffable grace of design Higher praise than
 clever winning or even cuspy

elephantine adj Used of programs or systems that are both
 conspicuous hogs owing perhaps to poor design founded on
 brute force and ignorance and exceedingly hairy in source
 form An elephantine program may be functional and even friendly
 but as in the old joke about being in bed with an elephant its
 tough to have around all the same and like a pachyderm difficult
 to maintain In extreme cases hackers have been known to make
 trumpeting sounds or perform expressive proboscatory mime at the
 mention of the offending program Usage semihumorous Compare
 has the elephant nature and the somewhat more pejorative
 monstrosity See also secondsystem effect and
 baroque

elevator controller n Another archetypal dumb embeddedsystems
 application like toaster which superseded it During one
 period 198384 in the deliberations of ANSI X3J11 the
 C standardization committee this was the canonical example of a
 really stupid memorylimited computation environment You cant
 require printf3 to be part of the default runtime library
  what if youre targeting an elevator controller Elevator
 controllers became important rhetorical weapons on both sides of
 several holy wars

ELIZA effect liz fekt AI community n The tendency of
 humans to attach associations to terms from prior experience
 For example there is nothing magic about the symbol  that
 makes it wellsuited to indicate addition its just that people
 associate it with addition Using  or plus to mean addition
 in a computer language is taking advantage of the ELIZA effect

 This term comes from the famous ELIZA program by Joseph Weizenbaum
 which simulated a Rogerian psychoanalyst by rephrasing many of the
 patients statements as questions and posing them to the patient
 It worked by simple pattern recognition and substitution of key
 words into canned phrases It was so convincing however that
 there are many anecdotes about people becoming very emotionally
 caught up in dealing with ELIZA All this was due to peoples
 tendency to attach to words meanings which the computer never put
 there The ELIZA effect is a Good Thing when writing a
 programming language but it can blind you to serious shortcomings
 when analyzing an Artificial Intelligence system Compare
 adhockery see also AIcomplete

elvish n 1 The Tengwar of Feanor a table of letterforms
 resembling the beautiful Celtic halfuncial hand of the Book
 of Kells Invented and described by J R R Tolkien
 in The Lord of The Rings as an orthography for his fictional
 elvish languages this system which is both visually and
 phonetically elegant has long fascinated hackers who tend to be
 interested by artificial languages in general It is traditional
 for graphics printers plotters window systems and the like to
 support a Feanorian typeface as one of their demo items See also
 elder days 2 By extension any odd or unreadable typeface
 produced by a graphics device 3 The typeface mundanely called
 Bocklin an artdecoish display font

EMACS eemaks from Editing MACroS n The ne plus ultra of
 hacker editors a programmable text editor with an entire LISP
 system inside it It was originally written by Richard Stallman in
 TECO under ITS at the MIT AI lab AI Memo 554 described
 it as an advanced selfdocumenting customizable extensible
 realtime display editor It has since been reimplemented any
 number of times by various hackers and versions exist which run
 under most major operating systems Perhaps the most widely used
 version also written by Stallman and now called GNU EMACS
 or GNUMACS runs principally under UNIX It includes
 facilities to run compilation subprocesses and send and receive
 mail many hackers spend up to 80 of their tube time inside
 it Other variants include GOSMACS CCA EMACS UniPress
 EMACS Montgomery EMACS jove epsilon and MicroEMACS

 Some EMACS versions running under window managers iconify as an
 overflowing kitchen sink perhaps to suggest the one feature the
 editor does not yet include Indeed some hackers find EMACS too
 heavyweight and baroque for their taste and expand the name as
 Escape Meta Alt Control Shift to spoof its heavy reliance on
 keystrokes decorated with bucky bits Other spoof expansions
 include Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping Eventually
 mallocs All Computer Storage and EMACS Makes A Computer

email eemayl 1 n Electronic mail automatically passed
 through computer networks andor via modems over commoncarrier
 lines Contrast snailmail papernet voicenet See
 network address 2 vt To send electronic mail

 Oddly enough the word emailed is actually listed in the OED it
 means embossed with a raised pattern or arranged in a net work
 A use from 1480 is given The word is derived from French
 emmailleure network

emoticon eemohtikon n An ASCII glyph used to indicate an
 emotional state in email or news Although originally intended
 mostly as jokes emoticons or some other explicit humor
 indication are virtually required under certain circumstances in
 highvolume textonly communication forums such as USENET the lack
 of verbal and visual cues can otherwise cause what were intended to
 be humorous sarcastic ironic or otherwise non100serious
 comments to be badly misinterpreted not always even by
 newbies resulting in arguments and flame wars

 Hundreds of emoticons have been proposed but only a few are in
 common use These include

 
 smiley face for humor laughter friendliness
 occasionally sarcasm

 
 frowney face for sadness anger or upset

 
 halfsmiley ha ha only serious
 also known as semismiley or winkey face

 
 wry face

 These may become more comprehensible if you tilt your head
 sideways to the left

 The first two listed are by far the most frequently encountered
 Hyphenless forms of them are common on CompuServe GEnie and BIX
 see also bixie On USENET smiley is often used as a
 generic term synonymous with emoticon as well as specifically
 for the happyface emoticon

 It appears that the emoticon was invented by one Scott Fahlman on
 the CMU bboard systems around 1980 He later wrote I wish I
 had saved the original post or at least recorded the date for
 posterity but I had no idea that I was starting something that
 would soon pollute all the worlds communication channels GLS
 confirms that he remembers this original posting

 Note for the newbie Overuse of the smiley is a mark of
 loserhood More than one per paragraph is a fairly sure sign that
 youve gone over the line

empire n Any of a family of military simulations derived from a
 game written by Peter Langston many years ago There are five or
 six multiplayer variants of varying degrees of sophistication and
 one singleplayer version implemented for both UNIX and VMS the
 latter is even available as MSDOS freeware All are notoriously
 addictive

engine n 1 A piece of hardware that encapsulates some function
 but cant be used without some kind of front end Today we
 have especially print engine the guts of a laser printer
 2 An analogous piece of software notionally one that does a lot
 of noisy crunching such as a database engine

 The hackish senses of engine are actually close to its original
 preIndustrialRevolution sense of a skill clever device or
 instrument the word is cognate to ingenuity This sense had
 not been completely eclipsed by the modern connotation of
 powertransducing machinery in Charles Babbages time which
 explains why he named the storedprogram computer that
 he designed in 1844 the Analytical Engine

English 1 nobs The source code for a program which may be in
 any language as opposed to the linkable or executable binary
 produced from it by a compiler The idea behind the term is that
 to a real hacker a program written in his favorite programming
 language is at least as readable as English Usage used mostly by
 oldtime hackers though recognizable in context 2 The official
 name of the database language used by the Pick Operating System
 actually a sort of crufty braindamaged SQL with delusions of
 grandeur The name permits marketroids to say Yes and you
 can program our computers in English to ignorant suits
 without quite running afoul of the truthinadvertising laws

enhancement n Marketroidspeak for a bug fix This abuse
 of language is a popular and timetested way to turn incompetence
 into increased revenue A hacker being ironic would instead call
 the fix a feature  or perhaps save some effort by declaring
 the bug itself to be a feature

ENQ enkw or enk from the ASCII mnemonic ENQuire for
 0000101 An online convention for querying someones availability
 After opening a talk mode connection to someone apparently in
 heavy hack mode one might type SYN SYN ENQ the SYNs
 representing notional synchronization bytes and expect a return
 of ACK or NAK depending on whether or not the person felt
 interruptible Compare ping finger and the usage of
 FOO listed under talk mode

EOF EOF abbreviation End Of File n 1 techspeak
 Refers esp to whatever outofband value is returned by
 Cs sequential characterinput functions and their equivalents in
 other environments when end of file has been reached This value
 is 1 under C libraries postdating V6 UNIX but was
 originally 0 2 UNIX The keyboard character usually controlD
 the ASCII EOT End Of Transmission character which is mapped by
 the terminal driver into an endoffile condition 3 Used by
 extension in noncomputer contexts when a human is doing something
 that can be modeled as a sequential read and cant go further
 Yeah I looked for a list of 360 mnemonics to post as a joke but
 I hit EOF pretty fast all the library had was a JCL manual
 See also EOL

EOL EOL End Of Line n Syn for newline derived
 perhaps from the original CDC6600 Pascal Now rare but widely
 recognized and occasionally used for brevity Used in the
 example entry under BNF See also EOF

EOU EOU n The mnemonic of a mythical ASCII control
 character End Of User that could make an ASR33 Teletype explode
 on receipt This parodied the numerous obscure delimiter and
 control characters left in ASCII from the days when it was
 associated more with wireservice teletypes than computers eg
 FS GS RS US EM SUB ETX and esp EOT It is worth
 remembering that ASR33s were big noisy mechanical beasts with a
 lot of clattering parts the notion that one might explode was
 nowhere near as ridiculous as it might seem to someone sitting in
 front of a tube or flatscreen today

epoch UNIX prob from astronomical timekeeping n The time
 and date corresponding to 0 in an operating systems clock and
 timestamp values Under most UNIX versions the epoch is 000000
 GMT January 1 1970 under VMS its 000000 GMT of November 17
 1858 base date of the US Naval Observatorys ephemerides
 System time is measured in seconds or ticks past the epoch
 Weird problems may ensue when the clock wraps around see wrap
 around which is not necessarily a rare event on systems
 counting 10 ticks per second a signed 32bit count of ticks is
 good only for 68 years The 1tickpersecond clock of UNIX is
 good only until January 18 2038 assuming at least some software
 continues to consider it signed and that word lengths dont
 increase by then See also wall time

epsilon see delta 1 n A small quantity of anything The
 cost is epsilon 2 adj Very small negligible less than
 marginal We can get this feature for epsilon cost
 3 within epsilon of close enough to be indistinguishable for
 all practical purposes This is even closer than being within
 delta of Thats not what I asked for but its within
 epsilon of what I wanted Alternatively it may mean not close
 enough but very little is required to get it there My program
 is within epsilon of working

epsilon squared n A quantity even smaller than epsilon as
 small in comparison to epsilon as epsilon is to something normal
 completely negligible If you buy a supercomputer for a million
 dollars the cost of the thousanddollar terminal to go with it is
 epsilon and the cost of the tendollar cable to connect them
 is epsilon squared Compare lost in the underflow lost

era the Syn epoch Websters Unabridged makes these words
 almost synonymous but era usually connotes a span of time rather
 than a point in time The epoch usage is recommended

Eric Conspiracy n A shadowy group of mustachioed hackers named
 Eric first pinpointed as a sinister conspiracy by an infamous
 talkbizarre posting ca 1986 this was doubtless influenced by the
 numerous Eric jokes in the Monty Python oeuvre There do indeed
 seem to be considerably more mustachioed Erics in hackerdom than
 the frequency of these three traits can account for unless they are
 correlated in some arcane way Wellknown examples include Eric
 Allman he of the Allman style described under indent style
 and Erik Fair coauthor of NNTP your editor has heard from about
 fourteen others by email and the organization line Eric
 Conspiracy Secret Laboratories now emanates regularly from more

Eris eris n The Greek goddess of Chaos Discord Confusion
 and Things You Know Not Of her name was latinized to Discordia and
 she was worshiped by that name in Rome Not a very friendly deity
 in the Classical original she was reinvented as a more benign
 personification of creative anarchy starting in 1959 by the
 adherents of Discordianism and has since been a semiserious
 subject of veneration in several fringe cultures including
 hackerdom See Discordianism Church of the SubGenius

evil adj As used by hackers implies that some system program
 person or institution is sufficiently maldesigned as to be not
 worth the bother of dealing with Unlike the adjectives in the
 cretinouslosingbraindamaged series evil does not
 imply incompetence or bad design but rather a set of goals or
 design criteria fatally incompatible with the speakers This is
 more an esthetic and engineering judgment than a moral one in the
 mainstream sense We thought about adding a Blue Glue
 interface but decided it was too evil to deal with TECO
 is neat but it can be pretty evil if youre prone to typos
 Often pronounced with the first syllable lengthened as eeeevil

EXCH eksch or eksch vt To exchange two things each for the
 other to swap places If you point to two people sitting down and
 say Exch you are asking them to trade places EXCH
 meaning EXCHange was originally the name of a PDP10 instruction
 that exchanged the contents of a register and a memory location
 Many newer hackers tend to be thinking instead of the PostScript
 exchange operator which is usually written in lowercase

excl ekskl n Abbreviation for exclamation point See
 bang shriek ASCII

EXE eksee or eeksee or EXE n An executable
 binary file Some operating systems notably MSDOS VMS and
 TWENEX use the extension EXE to mark such files This usage is

 not used To a hacker an exec is a always a program
 never a person

exercise left as an from technical books Used to complete a
 proof when one doesnt mind a handwave or to avoid one
 entirely The complete phrase is The proof or the rest is

fall over IBM vi Yet another synonym for crash or lose
 Fall over hard equates to crash and burn

fall through v n fallthrough var fallthrough
 1 To exit a loop by exhaustion ie by having fulfilled its exit
 condition rather than via a break or exception condition that exits
 from the middle of it This usage appears to be really old
 dating from the 1940s and 1950s 2 To fail a test that would have
 passed control to a subroutine or some other distant portion of
 code 3 In C fallthrough occurs when the flow of execution in
 a switch statement reaches a case label other than by
 jumping there from the switch header passing a point where one
 would normally expect to find a break A trivial example

 switch color
 
 case GREEN
 do_green
 break
 case PINK
 do_pink
  FALL THROUGH 
 case RED
 do_red
 break
 default
 do_blue
 break
 

 The variant spelling  FALL THRU  is also common

 The effect of this code is to do_green when color is
 GREEN do_red when color is RED
 do_blue on any other color other than PINK and
 and this is the important part do_pink and then
 do_red when color is PINK Fallthrough is
 considered harmful by some though there are contexts such as
 the coding of state machines in which it is natural it is
 generally considered good practice to include a comment
 highlighting the fallthrough where one would normally expect a
 break

fandango on core UNIXC hackers from the Mexican dance n
 In C a wild pointer that runs out of bounds causing a core

fascist adj 1 Said of a computer system with excessive or
 annoying security barriers usage limits or access policies The
 implication is that said policies are preventing hackers from
 getting interesting work done The variant fascistic seems
 to have been preferred at MIT poss by analogy with
 touristic see tourist 2 In the design of languages
 and other software tools the fascist alternative is the most
 restrictive and structured way of capturing a particular function
 the implication is that this may be desirable in order to simplify
 the implementation or provide tighter error checking Compare

 than local

fat electrons n Oldtime hacker David Cargills theory on the
 causation of computer glitches Your typical electric utility
 draws its line current out of the big generators with a pair of
 coil taps located near the top of the dynamo When the normal tap
 brushes get dirty they take them off line to clean up and use
 special auxiliary taps on the bottom of the coil Now
 this is a problem because when they do that they get not ordinary
 or thin electrons but the fatnsloppy electrons that are
 heavier and so settle to the bottom of the generator These flow
 down ordinary wires just fine but when they have to turn a sharp
 corner as in an integratedcircuit via theyre apt to get stuck
 This is what causes computer glitches Fascinating Obviously
 fat electrons must gain mass by bogon absorption  ESR

feature n 1 A good property or behavior as of a program
 Whether it was intended or not is immaterial 2 An intended
 property or behavior as of a program Whether it is good or not
 is immaterial but if bad it is also a misfeature 3 A
 surprising property or behavior in particular one that is
 purposely inconsistent because it works better that way  such an
 inconsistency is therefore a feature and not a bug This
 kind of feature is sometimes called a miswart see that entry
 for a classic example 4 A property or behavior that is
 gratuitous or unnecessary though perhaps also impressive or cute
 For example one feature of Common LISPs format function is
 the ability to print numbers in two different Romannumeral formats
 see bells whistles and gongs 5 A property or behavior
 that was put in to help someone else but that happens to be in your
 way 6 A bug that has been documented To call something a
 feature sometimes means the author of the program did not consider
 the particular case and that the program responded in a way that
 was unexpected but not strictly incorrect A standard joke is that
 a bug can be turned into a feature simply by documenting it
 then theoretically no one can complain about it because its in
 the manual or even by simply declaring it to be good Thats
 not a bug thats a feature is a common catchphrase See also
 feetch feetch creeping featurism wart green
 lightning

 The relationship among bugs features misfeatures warts and
 miswarts might be clarified by the following hypothetical exchange
 between two hackers on an airliner

 A This seat doesnt recline

 B Thats not a bug thats a feature There is an emergency
 exit door built around the window behind you and the route has to
 be kept clear

 A Oh Then its a misfeature they should have increased the
 spacing between rows here

 B Yes But if theyd increased spacing in only one section it
 would have been a wart  they wouldve had to make
 nonstandardlength ceiling panels to fit over the displaced
 seats

 A A miswart actually If they increased spacing throughout
 theyd lose several rows and a chunk out of the profit margin So
 unequal spacing would actually be the Right Thing

 B Indeed

 Undocumented feature is a common allegedly humorous euphemism
 for a bug

feature creature poss fr slang creature feature for a

feature key n The Macintosh key with the cloverleaf graphic on
 its keytop sometimes referred to as flower pretzel
 clover propeller beanie an apparent reference to the
 major feature of a propeller beanie splat or the command
 key The Macs equivalent of an alt key The proliferation
 of terms for this creature may illustrate one subtle peril of
 iconic interfaces

 Many people have been mystified by the cloverleaflike symbol that
 appears on the feature key Its oldest name is cross of St
 Hannes but it occurs in preChristian Viking art as a decorative
 motif Throughout Scandinavia today the road agencies use it to
 mark sites of historical interest Many of these are old churches
 hence the Swedish idiom for the symbol is kyrka cognate to
 English church and Scotsdialect kirk but pronounced
 shirk in modern Swedish This is in fact where Apple got the
 symbol they give the translation interesting feature

featurectomy feechrektmee n The act of removing a
 feature from a program Featurectomies come in two flavors the
 righteous and the reluctant Righteous featurectomies are
 performed because the remover believes the program would be more
 elegant without the feature or there is already an equivalent and
 better way to achieve the same end This is not quite the same
 thing as removing a misfeature Reluctant featurectomies are
 performed to satisfy some external constraint such as code size or
 execution speed

feep feep 1 n The soft electronic bell sound of a
 display terminal except for a VT52 a beep in fact the
 microcomputer world seems to prefer beep 2 vi To cause
 the display to make a feep sound ASR33s the original TTYs do
 not feep they have mechanical bells that ring Alternate forms
 beep bleep or just about anything suitably
 onomatopoeic Jeff MacNelly in his comic strip Shoe uses
 the word eep for sounds made by computer terminals and video
 games this is perhaps the closest written approximation yet The
 term breedle was sometimes heard at SAIL where the terminal
 bleepers are not particularly soft they sound more like the
 musical equivalent of a raspberry or Bronx cheer for a close
 approximation imagine the sound of a Star Trek communicators beep
 lasting for 5 seconds The feeper on a VT52 has been
 compared to the sound of a 52 Chevy stripping its gears See also

feeping creaturism feeping kreechrizm n A deliberate
 spoonerism for creeping featurism meant to imply that the
 system or program in question has become a misshapen creature of
 hacks This term isnt really well defined but it sounds so neat
 that most hackers have said or heard it It is probably reinforced
 by an image of terminals prowling about in the dark making their
 customary noises

 complicated thing With a tone of resignation it means Well
 Id rather keep it simple but I suppose it has to be done

fence n 1 A sequence of one or more distinguished
 outofband characters or other data items used to
 delimit a piece of data intended to be treated as a unit the
 computerscience literature calls this a sentinel The NUL
 ASCII 0000000 character that terminates strings in C is a fence
 Hex FF is also though slightly less frequently used this way
 See zigamorph 2 among users of optimizing compilers Any
 technique usually exploiting knowledge about the compiler that
 blocks certain optimizations Used when explicit mechanisms are
 not available or are overkill Typically a hack I call a dummy
 procedure there to force a flush of the optimizers
 registercoloring info can be expressed by the shorter Thats a
 fence procedure

fencepost error n 1 A problem with the discrete equivalent of a
 boundary condition Often exhibited in programs by iterative
 loops From the following problem If you build a fence 100 feet
 long with posts 10 feet apart how many posts do you need
 Either 9 or 11 is a better answer than the obvious 10 For
 example suppose you have a long list or array of items and want
 to process items m through n how many items are there The
 obvious answer is n  m but that is off by one the right
 answer is n  m  1 A program that used the obvious
 formula would have a fencepost error in it See also zeroth
 and offbyone error and note that not all offbyone errors
 are fencepost errors The game of Musical Chairs involves a
 catastrophic offbyone error where N people try to sit in
 N  1 chairs but its not a fencepost error Fencepost
 errors come from counting things rather than the spaces between
 them or vice versa or by neglecting to consider whether one
 should count one or both ends of a row 2 Occasionally an error
 induced by unexpectedly regular spacing of inputs which can for
 instance screw up your hash table

fepped out fept owt adj The Symbolics 3600 Lisp Machine has a
 FrontEnd Processor called a FEP compare sense 2 of box
 When the main processor gets wedged the FEP takes control of
 the keyboard and screen Such a machine is said to have

FidoNet n A worldwide hobbyist network of personal computers
 which exchange mail discussion groups and files Founded in 1984
 and originally consisting only of IBM PCs and compatibles FidoNet
 now includes such diverse machines as Apple s Ataris Amigas
 and UNIX systems Though it is much younger than USENET
 FidoNet is already in early 1991 a significant fraction of
 USENETs size at some 8000 systems

field circus a derogatory pun on field service n The field
 service organization of any hardware manufacturer but especially
 DEC There is an entire genre of jokes about DEC field circus
 engineers

 with a flat tire
 A Hes changing one tire at a time to see which one is flat

 Q How can you recognize a DEC field circus engineer
 who is out of gas
 A Hes changing one tire at a time to see which one is flat

 See Easter egging for additional insight on these jokes

 There is also the Field Circus Cheer from the plan file for
 DEC on MITAI

 from one BBS to another 2 vt Sending someone a file by using
 the File Attach option in a BBS mailer

File Request FidoNet 1 n The FidoNet equivalent of
 FTP in which one BBS system automatically dials another and
 snarfs one or more files Often abbreviated FReq files

 that files are announced as being available forby anonymous
 FTP on the Internet 2 vt The act of getting a copy of a file
 by using the File Request option of the BBS mailer

file signature n A magic number sense 3

filk filk from SF fandom where a typo for folk was
 adopted as a new word nv A filk is a popular or folk song
 with lyrics revised or completely new lyrics intended for humorous
 effect when read andor to be sung late at night at SF conventions
 There is a flourishing subgenre of these called computer filks
 written by hackers and often containing rather sophisticated
 technical humor See double bucky for an example Compare
 hing and newsfroup

film at 11 MIT in parody of TV newscasters 1 Used in
 conversation to announce ordinary events with a sarcastic
 implication that these events are earthshattering ITS
 crashes film at 11 Bug found in scheduler film at 11
 2 Also widely used outside MIT to indicate that additional
 information will be available at some future time without
 the implication of anything particularly ordinary about the
 referenced event For example The mail file server died this
 morning we found garbage all over the root directory Film at
 11 would indicate that a major failure had occurred but the
 people working on it have no additional information about it Use
 of the phrase in this way suggests gently people would appreciate
 it if users would quit bothering them and wait for the 1100 news
 for additional information

filter orig UNIX now also in MSDOS n A program that
 processes an input data stream into an output data stream in some
 welldefined way and does no IO to anywhere else except possibly
 on error conditions one designed to be used as a stage in a
 pipeline see plumbing

Finagles Law n The generalized or folk version of
 Murphys Law fully named Finagles Law of Dynamic
 Negatives and usually rendered Anything that can go wrong
 will One variant favored among hackers is The perversity of
 the Universe tends towards a maximum but see also Hanlons
 Razor The label Finagles Law was popularized by SF author
 Larry Niven in several stories depicting a frontier culture of
 asteroid miners this Belter culture professed a religion
 andor running joke involving the worship of the dread god Finagle
 and his mad prophet Murphy

fine WPI adj Good but not good enough to be cuspy The word
 fine is used elsewhere of course but without the implicit
 comparison to the higher level implied by cuspy

finger WAITS via BSD UNIX 1 n A program that displays a
 particular user or all users logged on the system or a remote
 system Typically shows full name last login time idle time
 terminal line and terminal location where applicable May also
 display a plan file left by the user 2 vt To apply finger
 to a username 3 vt By extension to check a humans current
 state by any means Foodp T OK finger Lisa and see
 if shes idle 4 Any picture composed of ASCII characters
 depicting the finger Originally a humorous component of ones
 plan file to deter the curious fingerer sense 2 it has entered
 the arsenal of some flamers

fingerpointing syndrome n Alltoofrequent result of bugs esp
 in new or experimental configurations The hardware vendor points
 a finger at the software The software vendor points a finger
 at the hardware All the poor users get is the finger

finn IRC v To pull rank on somebody based on the amount of
 time one has spent on IRC The term derives from the fact
 that IRC was originally written in Finland in 1987

firebottle n A large primitive powerhungry active electrical
 device similar in function to a FET but constructed out of glass
 metal and vacuum Characterized by high cost low density low
 reliability hightemperature operation and high power
 dissipation Sometimes mistakenly called a tube in the US
 or a valve in England another hackish term is glassfet

firefighting n 1 What sysadmins have to do to correct sudden
 operational problems An opposite of hacking Been hacking your
 new newsreader No a power glitch hosed the network and I spent
 the whole afternoon fighting fires 2 The act of throwing lots
 of manpower and late nights at a project esp to get it out
 before deadline See also gang bang Mongolian Hordes
 technique however the term firefighting connotes that the
 effort is going into chasing bugs rather than adding features

firehose syndrome n In mainstream folklore it is observed that
 trying to drink from a firehose can be a good way to rip your lips
 off On computer networks the absence or failure of flow control
 mechanisms can lead to situations in which the sending system
 sprays a massive flood of packets at an unfortunate receiving
 system more than it can handle Compare overrun buffer
 overflow

firewall code n The code you put in a system say a telephone
 switch to make sure that the users cant do any damage Since
 users always want to be able to do everything but never want to
 suffer for any mistakes the construction of a firewall is a
 question not only of defensive coding but also of interface
 presentation so that users dont even get curious about those
 corners of a system where they can burn themselves

firewall machine n A dedicated gateway machine with special
 security precautions on it used to service outside network
 connections and dialin lines The idea is to protect a cluster of
 more loosely administered machines hidden behind it from
 crackers The typical firewall is an inexpensive microbased
 UNIX box kept clean of critical data with a bunch of modems and
 public network ports on it but just one carefully watched
 connection back to the rest of the cluster The special
 precautions may include threat monitoring callback and even a
 complete iron box keyable to particular incoming IDs or
 activity patterns Syn flytrap Venus flytrap

fireworks mode n The mode a machine is sometimes said to be in when
 it is performing a crash and burn operation

 file cabinet may be referred to as a fish tank

FISH queue acronym by analogy with FIFO First In First Out
 n First In Still Here A joking way of pointing out that
 processing of a particular sequence of events or requests has
 stopped dead Also FISH mode and FISHnet the latter
 may be applied to any network that is running really slowly or
 exhibiting extreme flakiness

FITNR  Thinking Machines Inc Fixed In the Next Release
 A writtenonly notation attached to bug reports Often wishful

 times to be ignored

flag n A variable or quantity that can take on one of two
 values a bit particularly one that is used to indicate one of two
 outcomes or is used to control which of two things is to be done
 This flag controls whether to clear the screen before printing
 the message The program status word contains several flag
 bits Used of humans analogously to bit See also
 hidden flag mode bit

flag day n A software change that is neither forward nor
 backwardcompatible and which is costly to make and costly to
 reverse Can we install that without causing a flag day for all
 users This term has nothing to do with the use of the word
 flag to mean a variable that has two values It came into use
 when a massive change was made to the Multics timesharing
 system to convert from the old ASCII code to the new one this was
 scheduled for Flag Day a US holiday June 14 1966 See also
 backward combatability

flaky adj var sp flakey Subject to frequent lossage
 This use is of course related to the common slang use of the word
 to describe a person as eccentric crazy or just unreliable A
 system that is flaky is working sort of  enough that you are
 tempted to try to use it  but fails frequently enough that the
 odds in favor of finishing what you start are low Commonwealth
 hackish prefers dodgy or wonky

flamage flaymj n Flaming verbiage esp highnoise
 lowsignal postings to USENET or other electronic fora
 Often in the phrase the usual flamage Flaming is the act
 itself flamage the content a flame is a single flaming
 message See flame

flame 1 vi To post an email message intended to insult and
 provoke 2 vi To speak incessantly andor rabidly on some
 relatively uninteresting subject or with a patently ridiculous
 attitude 3 vt Either of senses 1 or 2 directed with
 hostility at a particular person or people 4 n An instance of
 flaming When a discussion degenerates into useless controversy
 one might tell the participants Now youre just flaming or
 Stop all that flamage to try to get them to cool down so to
 speak

 USENETter Marc Ramsey who was at WPI from 1972 to 1976 adds I
 am 99 certain that the use of flame originated at WPI Those
 who made a nuisance of themselves insisting that they needed to use
 a TTY for real work came to be known as flaming asshole lusers
 Other particularly annoying people became flaming asshole ravers
 which shortened to flaming ravers and ultimately flamers I
 remember someone picking up on the Human Torch pun but I dont
 think flame onoff was ever much used at WPI See also
 asbestos

 The term may have been independently invented at several different
 places it is also reported that flaming was in use to mean
 something like interminably drawnout semiserious discussions
 latenight bull sessions at Carleton College during 19681971

 Its possible that the hackish sense of flame is much older than
 that The poet Chaucer was also what passed for a wizard hacker in
 his time he wrote a treatise on the astrolabe the most advanced
 computing device of the day In Chaucers Troilus and
 Cressida Cressida laments her inability to grasp the proof of a
 particular mathematical theorem her uncle Pandarus then observes
 that its called the fleminge of wrecches This phrase seems
 to have been intended in context as that which puts the wretches
 to flight but was probably just as ambiguous in Middle English as
 the flaming of wretches would be today One suspects that
 Chaucer would be right at home on USENET

flame bait n A posting intended to trigger a flame war or one
 that invites flames in reply

flame on viinterj 1 To begin to flame The punning
 reference to Marvel Comicss Human Torch is no longer widely
 recognized 2 To continue to flame See rave burble

flame war n var flamewar An acrimonious dispute
 especially when conducted on a public electronic forum such as
 USENET

flamer n One who habitually flames Said esp of obnoxious
 USENET personalities

flap vt 1 To unload a DECtape so it goes flap flap
 flap Oldtime hackers at MIT tell of the days when the
 disk was device 0 and microtapes were 1 2 and
 attempting to flap device 0 would instead start a motor banging
 inside a cabinet near the disk 2 By extension to unload any
 magnetic tape See also macrotape Modern cartridge tapes no
 longer actually flap but the usage has remained The term could
 well be reapplied to DECs TK50 cartridge tape drive a
 spectacularly misengineered contraption which makes a loud flapping
 sound almost like an old reeltype lawnmower in one of its many
 tapeeating failure modes

flarp flarp Rutgers University n Yet another metasyntactic
 variable see foo Among those who use it it is associated
 with a legend that any program not containing the word flarp
 somewhere will not work The legend is discreetly silent on the
 reliability of programs which do contain the magic word

flat adj 1 Lacking any complex internal structure That
 bitty box has only a flat filesystem not a hierarchical
 one The verb form is flatten 2 Said of a memory
 architecture like that of the VAX or 680x0 that is one big linear
 address space typically with each possible value of a processor
 register corresponding to a unique core address as opposed to a
 segmented architecture like that of the 80x86 in which
 addresses are composed from a baseregisteroffset pair segmented
 designs are generally considered cretinous

 Note that sense 1 at least with respect to filesystems is usually
 used pejoratively while sense 2 is a Good Thing

flatASCII adj Said of a text file that contains only 7bit ASCII
 characters and uses only ASCIIstandard control characters that
 is has no embedded codes specific to a particular text formatter
 or markup language and no metacharacters Syn
 plainASCII Compare flatfile

flatfile adj A flattened representation of some database or
 tree or network structure as a single file from which the
 structure could implicitly be rebuilt esp one in flatASCII
 form

flatten vt To remove structural information esp to filter
 something with an implicit tree structure into a simple sequence of
 leaves also tends to imply mapping to flatASCII This code
 flattens an expression with parentheses into an equivalent
 canonical form

flavor n 1 Variety type kind DDT commands come in two
 flavors These lights come in two flavors big red ones and
 small green ones See vanilla 2 The attribute that causes
 something to be flavorful Usually used in the phrase yields
 additional flavor This convention yields additional flavor by
 allowing one to print text either rightsideup or upsidedown
 See vanilla This usage was certainly reinforced by the
 terminology of quantum chromodynamics in which quarks the
 constituents of eg protons come in six flavors up down
 strange charm top bottom and three colors red blue green
  however hackish use of flavor at MIT predated QCD 3 The
 term for class in the objectoriented sense in the LISP Machine
 Flavors system Though the Flavors design has been superseded
 notably by the Common LISP CLOS facility the term flavor is
 still used as a general synonym for class by some LISP hackers

flavorful adj Full of flavor esthetically pleasing See
 random and losing for antonyms See also the entries for
 taste and elegant

flippy flipee n A singlesided floppy disk altered for
 doublesided use by addition of a second writenotch so called
 because it must be flipped over for the second side to be
 accessible No longer common

flood IRC v To dump large amounts of text onto an IRC
 channel This is especially rude when the text is uninteresting
 and the other users are trying to carry on a serious conversation

flowchart techspeak n An archaic form of visual controlflow
 specification employing arrows and speech balloons of various
 shapes Hackers never use flowcharts consider them extremely
 silly and associate them with COBOL programmers card
 wallopers and other lower forms of life This is because from a
 hackers point of view they are no easier to read than code are
 less precise and tend to fall out of sync with the code so that
 they either obfuscate it rather than explaining it or require
 extra maintenance effort that doesnt improve the code See also
 pdl sense 3

flower key Mac users n See feature key

flush v 1 To delete something usually superfluous or to abort
 an operation All that nonsense has been flushed 2 UNIXC
 To force buffered IO to disk as with an fflush3 call
 This is not an abort or deletion as in sense 1 but a
 demand for early completion 3 To leave at the end of a days
 work as opposed to leaving for a meal Im going to flush
 now Time to flush 4 To exclude someone from an activity
 or to ignore a person

 Flush was standard ITS terminology for aborting an output
 operation one spoke of the text that would have been printed but
 was not as having been flushed It is speculated that this term
 arose from a vivid image of flushing unwanted characters by hosing
 down the internal output buffer washing the characters away before
 they can be printed The UNIXC usage on the other hand was
 propagated by the fflush3 call in Cs standard IO library
 though it is reported to have been in use among BLISS programmers
 at DEC and on Honeywell and IBM machines as far back as 1965
 UNIXC hackers find the ITS usage confusing and vice versa

flypage fli payjn alt fly page A banner sense 1

Flyspeck 3 n Standard name for any font that is so tiny as to be
 unreadable by analogy with such names as Helvetica 10 for
 10point Helvetica Legal boilerplate is usually printed in
 Flyspeck 3

flytrap n See firewall machine

FM n Not Frequency Modulation but rather an
 abbreviation for Fucking Manual the backformation from
 RTFM Used to refer to the manual itself in the RTFM
 Have you seen the Networking FM lately

FOAF  USENET n Acronym for Friend Of A Friend The
 source of an unverified possibly untrue story This was not
 originated by hackers it is used in Jan Brunvands books on urban
 folklore but is much better recognized on USENET and elsewhere
 than in mainstream English

FOD fod v Abbreviation for Finger of Death originally a
 spellname from fantasy gaming To terminate with extreme prejudice
 and with no regard for other people From MUDs where the
 wizard command FOD player results in the immediate and total
 death of player usually as punishment for obnoxious behavior
 This migrated to other circumstances such as Im going to fod
 the process that is burning all the cycles Compare gun

 In aviation FOD means Foreign Object Damage eg what happens
 when a jet engine sucks up a rock on the runway or a bird in
 flight Finger of Death is a distressingly apt description of
 what this does to the engine

fold case v See smash case This term tends to be used
 more by people who dont mind that their tools smash case It also
 connotes that case is ignored but case distinctions in data
 processed by the tool in question arent destroyed

followup n On USENET a posting generated in response to
 another posting as opposed to a reply which goes by email
 rather than being broadcast Followups include the ID of the
 parent message in their headers smart newsreaders can use
 this information to present USENET news in conversation sequence
 rather than orderofarrival See thread

fontology XEROX PARC n The body of knowledge dealing with the
 construction and use of new fonts eg for window systems and
 typesetting software It has been said that fontology
 recapitulates fileogeny

 Unfortunately this reference to the embryological dictum that
 Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny is not merely a joke On the
 Macintosh for example System 7 has to go through contortions to
 compensate for an earlier design error that created a whole
 different set of abstractions for fonts parallel to files and
 folders  ESR

foo foo 1 interj Term of disgust 2 Used very generally
 as a sample name for absolutely anything esp programs and files
 esp scratch files 3 First on the standard list of
 metasyntactic variables used in syntax examples See also
 bar baz qux quux corge grault
 garply waldo fred plugh xyzzy
 thud

 The etymology of hackish foo is obscure When used in
 connection with bar it is generally traced to the WWIIera Army
 slang acronym FUBAR Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition later
 bowdlerized to foobar See also FUBAR

 However the use of the word foo itself has more complicated
 antecedents including a long history in comic strips and cartoons
 The old Smokey Stover comic strips by Bill Holman often
 included the word FOO in particular on license plates of cars
 allegedly FOO and BAR also occurred in Walt Kellys
 Pogo strips In the 1938 cartoon Daffy Doc a very
 early version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying SILENCE IS
 FOO oddly this seems to refer to some approving or positive
 affirmative use of foo It has been suggested that this might be
 related to the Chinese word fu sometimes transliterated
 foo which can mean happiness when spoken with the proper
 tone the liondog guardians flanking the steps of many Chinese
 restaurants are properly called fu dogs

 It is even possible that hacker usage actually springs from
 FOO Lampoons and Parody the title of a comic book first
 issued in September 1958 the byline read C Crumb but the style
 of the art suggests this may well have been a sortof pseudonym for
 noted weirdcomix artist Robert Crumb The title FOO was featured
 in large letters on the front cover What the word meant to Mr
 Crumb is anybodys guess

 An oldtime member reports that in the 1959 Dictionary of the
 TMRC Language compiled at TMRC there was an entry that went
 something like this

 FOO The first syllable of the sacred chant phrase FOO MANE PADME
 HUM Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning

 For more about the legendary foo counters see TMRC Almost
 the entire staff of what became the MIT AI LAB was involved with
 TMRC and probably picked the word up there

 Very probably hackish foo had no single origin and derives
 through all these channels from Yiddish feh andor English
 fooey

foobar n Another common metasyntactic variable see foo
 Hackers do not generally use this to mean FUBAR in
 either the slang or jargon sense

fool n As used by hackers specifically describes a person who
 habitually reasons from obviously or demonstrably incorrect
 premises and cannot be persuaded by evidence to do otherwise it is
 not generally used in its other senses ie to describe a person
 with a native incapacity to reason correctly or a clown Indeed
 in hackish experience many fools are capable of reasoning all too
 effectively in executing their errors See also cretin
 loser fool file the

fool file the USENET n A notional repository of all the most
 dramatically and abysmally stupid utterances ever There is a
 subgenre of sig blocks that consists of the header From the
 fool file followed by some quote the poster wishes to represent
 as an immortal gem of dimwittery for this to be really effective
 the quote has to be so obviously wrong as to be laughable More
 than one USENETter has achieved an unwanted notoriety by being
 quoted in this way

Foonly n 1 The PDP10 successor that was to have been built by
 the Super Foonly project at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
 Laboratory along with a new operating system The intention was to
 leapfrog from the old DEC timesharing system SAIL was running to a
 new generation bypassing TENEX which at that time was the ARPANET
 standard ARPA funding for both the Super Foonly and the new
 operating system was cut in 1974 Most of the design team went to
 DEC and contributed greatly to the design of the PDP10 model KL10
 2 The name of the company formed by Dave Poole one of the
 principal Super Foonly designers and one of hackerdoms more
 colorful personalities Many people remember the parrot which sat
 on Pooles shoulder and was a regular companion 3 Any of the
 machines built by Pooles company The first was the F1 aka
 Super Foonly which was the computational engine used to create
 the graphics in the movie TRON The F1 was the fastest
 PDP10 ever built but only one was ever made The effort drained
 Foonly of its financial resources and they turned towards building
 smaller slower and much less expensive machines Unfortunately
 these ran not the popular TOPS20 but a TENEX variant called
 Foonex this seriously limited their market Also the machines
 shipped were actually wirewrapped engineering prototypes requiring
 individual attention from more than usually competent site
 personnel and thus had significant reliability problems Pooles
 legendary temper and unwillingness to suffer fools gladly did not
 help matters By the time of the Jupiter project cancellation in
 1983 Foonlys proposal to build another F1 was eclipsed by the
 Mars and the company never quite recovered See the
 Mars entry for the continuation and moral of this story

footprint n 1 The floor or desk area taken up by a piece of
 hardware 2 IBM The audit trail if any left by a crashed
 program often in plural footprints See also
 toeprint

for free adj Said of a capability of a programming language or
 hardware equipment that is available by its design without needing
 cleverness to implement In APL we get the matrix operations for
 free And owing to the way revisions are stored in this
 system you get revision trees for free Usually it refers to a
 serendipitous feature of doing things a certain way compare
 big win but it may refer to an intentional but secondary
 feature

for the rest of us from the Mac slogan The computer for the
 rest of us adj 1 Used to describe a spiffy product whose
 affordability shames other comparable products or more often
 used sarcastically to describe spiffy but very overpriced
 products 2 Describes a program with a limited interface
 deliberately limited capabilities nonorthogonality inability to
 compose primitives or any other limitation designed to not
 confuse a naive user This places an upper bound on how far
 that user can go before the program begins to get in the way of the
 task instead of helping accomplish it Used in reference to
 Macintosh software which doesnt provide obvious capabilities
 because it is thought that the poor lusers might not be able to
 handle them Becomes the rest of them when used in
 thirdparty reference thus Yes it is an attractive program
 but its designed for The Rest Of Them means a program that
 superficially looks neat but has no depth beyond the surface flash
 See also WIMP environment Macintrash
 pointanddrool interface userfriendly

for values of MIT A common rhetorical maneuver at MIT is to use
 any of the canonical random numbers as placeholders for
 variables The max function takes 42 arguments for arbitrary
 values of 42 There are 69 ways to leave your lover for
 69  50 This is especially likely when the speaker has uttered
 a random number and realizes that it was not recognized as such
 but even nonrandom numbers are occasionally used in this
 fashion A related joke is that pi equals 3  for
 small values of pi and large values of 3

 Historical note this usage probably derives from the programming
 language MAD Michigan Algorithm Decoder an Algollike language
 that was the most common choice among mainstream nonhacker users
 at MIT in the mid60s It had a control structure FOR VALUES OF X
  3 7 99 DO  that would repeat the indicated instructions for
 each value in the list unlike the usual FOR that only works for
 arithmetic sequences of values MAD is long extinct but similar
 forconstructs still flourish eg in UNIXs shell languages

fora pln Plural of forum

foreground UNIX vt To foreground a task is to bring it to
 the top of ones stack for immediate processing and hackers
 often use it in this sense for noncomputer tasks If your
 presentation is due next week I guess Id better foreground
 writing up the design document

 Technically on a timesharing system a task executing in
 foreground is one able to accept input from and return output to
 the user oppose background Nowadays this term is primarily
 associated with UNIX but it appears first to have been used
 in this sense on OS360 Normally there is only one foreground
 task per terminal or terminal window having multiple processes
 simultaneously reading the keyboard is a good way to lose

fork bomb UNIX n A particular species of wabbit that can
 be written in one line of C main forfork or shell
 0  0  on any UNIX system or occasionally created by an
 egregious coding bug A fork bomb process explodes by
 recursively spawning copies of itself using the UNIX system call
 fork2 Eventually it eats all the process table entries
 and effectively wedges the system Fortunately fork bombs are
 relatively easy to spot and kill so creating one deliberately
 seldom accomplishes more than to bring the just wrath of the gods
 down upon the perpetrator See also logic bomb

forked UNIX prob influenced by a mainstream expletive adj
 Terminally slow or dead Originated when one system was slowed to
 a snails pace by an inadvertent fork bomb

Fortrash fortrash n Hackerism for the FORTRAN language
 referring to its primitive design gross and irregular syntax
 limited control constructs and slippery exceptionfilled

fossil n 1 In software a misfeature that becomes
 understandable only in historical context as a remnant of times
 past retained so as not to break compatibility Example the
 retention of octal as default base for string escapes in C in
 spite of the better match of hexadecimal to ASCII and modern
 byteaddressable architectures See dusty deck 2 More
 restrictively a feature with past but no present utility
 Example the forceallcaps LCASE bits in the V7 and BSD
 UNIX tty driver designed for use with monocase terminals In a
 perversion of the usual backwardcompatibility goal this
 functionality has actually been expanded and renamed in some later
 USG UNIX releases as the IUCLC and OLCUC bits 3 The FOSSIL
 FidoOpusSeadog Standard Interface Level driver specification
 for serialport access to replace the braindead routines in
 the IBM PC ROMs Fossils are used by most MSDOS BBS software
 in preference to the supported ROM routines which do not support
 interruptdriven operation or setting speeds above 9600 the use of
 a semistandard FOSSIL library is preferable to the bare metal
 serial port programming otherwise required Since the FOSSIL
 specification allows additional functionality to be hooked in
 drivers that use the hook but do not provide serialport
 access themselves are named with a modifier as in video
 fossil

fourcolor glossies 1 Literature created by marketroids
 that allegedly contains technical specs but which is in fact as
 superficial as possible without being totally contentfree
 Forget the fourcolor glossies give me the tech ref manuals
 Often applied as an indication of superficiality even when the
 material is printed on ordinary paper in black and white
 Fourcolorglossy manuals are never useful for finding a

 contain enough information to diagnose why the program doesnt
 produce the expected or desired output

fragile adj Syn brittle

freeze v To lock an evolving software distribution or document
 against changes so it can be released with some hope of stability
 Carries the strong implication that the item in question will
 unfreeze at some future date OK fix that bug and well
 freeze for release

 There are more specific constructions on this A feature freeze
 for example locks out modifications intended to introduce new
 features a code freeze connotes no more changes at all
 At Sun Microsystems and elsewhere one may also hear references to
 code slush  that is an almostbutnotquite frozen state

fried adj 1 Nonworking due to hardware failure burnt out
 Especially used of hardware brought down by a power glitch see
 glitch dropouts a short or some other electrical
 event Sometimes this literally happens to electronic circuits
 In particular resistors can burn out and transformers can melt
 down emitting noxious smoke  see friode SED and
 LER However this term is also used metaphorically
 Compare frotzed 2 Of people exhausted Said particularly
 of those who continue to work in such a state Often used as an
 explanation or excuse Yeah I know that fix destroyed the file
 system but I was fried when I put it in Esp common in
 conjunction with brain My brain is fried today Im very
 short on sleep

friode friohd TMRC n A reversible that is fused or
 blown diode Compare fried see also SED LER

fritterware n An excess of capability that serves no productive
 end The canonical example is fontdiddling software on the Mac
 see macdink the term describes anything that eats huge
 amounts of time for quite marginal gains in function but seduces
 people into using it anyway

frob frob 1 n MIT The TMRC definition was FROB  a
 protruding arm or trunnion by metaphoric extension a frob
 is any random small thing an object that you can comfortably hold
 in one hand something you can frob See frobnitz 2 vt
 Abbreviated form of frobnicate 3 from the MUD world
 A command on some MUDs that changes a players
 experience level this can be used to make wizards also to
 request wizard privileges on the professional courtesy
 grounds that one is a wizard elsewhere The command is actually
 frobnicate but is universally abbreviated to the shorter form

frobnicate frobnikayt vt Poss derived from
 frobnitz and usually abbreviated to frob but
 frobnicate is recognized as the official full form To
 manipulate or adjust to tweak One frequently frobs bits or other
 2state devices Thus Please frob the light switch that is
 flip it but also Stop frobbing that clasp youll break it
 One also sees the construction to frob a frob See tweak
 and twiddle Usage frob twiddle and tweak sometimes
 connote points along a continuum Frob connotes aimless
 manipulation twiddle connotes gross manipulation often a
 coarse search for a proper setting tweak connotes finetuning
 If someone is turning a knob on an oscilloscope then if hes
 carefully adjusting it he is probably tweaking it if he is just
 turning it but looking at the screen he is probably twiddling it
 but if hes just doing it because turning a knob is fun hes
 frobbing it The variant frobnosticate has been recently
 reported

frobnitz frobnits pl frobnitzem frobnitzm or
 frobni frobni TMRC n An unspecified physical object a
 widget Also refers to electronic black boxes This rare form is
 usually abbreviated to frotz or more commonly to frob
 Also used are frobnule frobnyool and frobule
 frobyool Starting perhaps in 1979 frobozz
 frboz plural frobbotzim frbotzm has also
 become very popular largely through its exposure as a name via
 Zork These can also be applied to nonphysical objects such
 as data structures

 Pete Samson compiler of the TMRC lexicon adds Under the
 TMRC railroad layout were many storage boxes managed in 1958
 by David R Sawyer Several had fanciful designations written on
 them such as Frobnitz Coil Oil Perhaps DRS intended Frobnitz
 to be a proper name but the name was quickly taken for the
 thing This was almost certainly the origin of the term

frogging University of Waterloo v 1 Partial corruption of a text
 file or input stream by some bug or consistent glitch as opposed
 to random events like line noise or media failures Might occur

 stuck so that some characters were correct and others were not
 See terminak for a historical example 2 By extension
 accidental display of text in a mode where the output device emits
 special symbols or mnemonics rather than conventional ASCII Often
 happens for example when using a terminal or comm program on a
 device like an IBM PC with a special highhalf character set and
 with the bitparity assumption wrong A hacker sufficiently
 familiar with ASCII bit patterns might be able to read the display
 anyway

 abbreviated FMH in polite company

 This entry is an extreme example of the hackish habit of coining
 elaborate and evocative terms for lossage Here we see a quite
 selfconscious parody of mainstream expletives that has become a
 running gag in part of the hacker culture it illustrates the
 hackish tendency to turn any situation even one of extreme
 frustration into an intellectual game the point being in this
 case to creatively produce a longwinded description of the
 most anatomically absurd mental image possible  the short forms
 implicitly allude to all the ridiculous long forms ever spoken
 Scatological language is actually relatively uncommon among
 hackers and there was some controversy over whether this entry
 ought to be included at all As it reflects a live usage
 recognizably peculiar to the hacker culture we feel it is
 in the hackish spirit of truthfulness and opposition to all
 forms of censorship to record it here ESR  GLS

FUD fuhd n Defined by Gene Amdahl after he left IBM to found
 his own company FUD is the fear uncertainty and doubt that IBM
 sales people instill in the minds of potential customers who might
 be considering Amdahl products The idea of course was to
 persuade them to go with safe IBM gear rather than with
 competitors equipment This was traditionally done by promising
 that Good Things would happen to people who stuck with IBM but
 Dark Shadows loomed over the future of competitors equipment or
 software See IBM

FUD wars fuhd worz n from FUD Political posturing engaged in
 by hardware and software vendors ostensibly committed to
 standardization but actually willing to fragment the market to
 protect their own shares The UNIX International vs OSF conflict
 is but one outstanding example

fudge 1 vt To perform in an incomplete but marginally acceptable
 way particularly with respect to the writing of a program I
 didnt feel like going through that pain and suffering so I fudged
 it  Ill fix it later 2 n The resulting code

fudge factor n A value or parameter that is varied in an ad hoc way
 to produce the desired result The terms tolerance and
 slop are also used though these usually indicate a onesided
 leeway such as a buffer that is made larger than necessary
 because one isnt sure exactly how large it needs to be and it is
 better to waste a little space than to lose completely for not
 having enough A fudge factor on the other hand can often be
 tweaked in more than one direction A good example is the fuzz
 typically allowed in floatingpoint calculations two numbers being
 compared for equality must be allowed to differ by a small amount
 if that amount is too small a computation may never terminate
 while if it is too large results will be needlessly inaccurate
 Fudge factors are frequently adjusted incorrectly by programmers
 who dont fully understand their import See also coefficient

 change so its obvious nonoptimality is left alone Often used to
 describe interfaces The more bugs something has that nobody has
 bothered to fix because workarounds are easier the funkier it is
 TECO and UUCP are funky The Intel i860s exception handling is
 extraordinarily funky Most standards acquire funkiness as they

funny money n 1 Notional dollar units of computing time andor
 storage handed to students at the beginning of a computer course
 also called play money or purple money in implicit
 opposition to real or green money In New Zealand and Germany
 the odd usage paper money has been recorded in Gremany the
 particularly amusing synonym transfer rouble commemmorates the
 worthlessness of the exUSSRs currency When your funny money
 ran out your account froze and you needed to go to a professor to
 get more Fortunately the plunging cost of timesharing cycles has
 made this less common The amounts allocated were almost
 invariably too small even for the nonhackers who wanted to slide
 by with minimum work In extreme cases the practice led to
 smallscale black markets in bootlegged computer accounts 2 By

 hatred implying that gas should be dispensed in generous
 quantities thereby exterminating the source of irritation Some
 loser just reloaded the system for no reason Gas 2 interj A
 suggestion that someone or something ought to be flushed out of
 mercy The systems getting wedged every few minutes
 Gas 3 vt To flush sense 1 You should gas that old
 crufty software 4 IBM n Dead space in nonsequentially
 organized files that was occupied by data that has been deleted
 the compression operation that removes it is called degassing by
 analogy perhaps with the use of the same term in vacuum
 technology 5 IBM n Empty space on a disk that has been
 clandestinely allocated against future need

gaseous adj Deserving of being gassed Disseminated by
 Geoff Goodfellow while at SRI became particularly popular after
 the MosconeMilk killings in San Francisco when it was learned
 that the defendant Dan White a politician who had supported
 Proposition 7 would get the gas chamber under Proposition 7 if
 convicted of firstdegree murder he was eventually convicted of
 manslaughter

GC GC from LISP terminology Garbage Collect
 1 vt To clean up and throw away useless things I think Ill
 GC the top of my desk today When said of files this is
 equivalent to GFR 2 vt To recycle reclaim or put to
 another use 3 n An instantiation of the garbage collector
 process

 Garbage collection is computerscience jargon for a particular
 class of strategies for dynamically reallocating computer memory
 One such strategy involves periodically scanning all the data in
 memory and determining what is no longer accessible useless data
 items are then discarded so that the memory they occupy can be
 recycled and used for another purpose Implementations of the LISP
 language usually use garbage collection

 In jargon the full phrase is sometimes heard but the abbrev is
 more frequently used because it is shorter Note that there is an
 ambiguity in usage that has to be resolved by context Im going
 to garbagecollect my desk usually means to clean out the
 drawers but it could also mean to throw away or recycle the desk
 itself

GCOS jeekohs n A quickanddirty clone of
 System360 DOS that emerged from GE around 1970 originally called
 GECOS the General Electric Comprehensive Operating System Later
 kluged to support primitive timesharing and transaction processing
 After the buyout of GEs computer division by Honeywell the name
 was changed to General Comprehensive Operating System GCOS
 Other OS groups at Honeywell began referring to it as Gods Chosen
 Operating System allegedly in reaction to the GCOS crowds
 uninformed and snotty attitude about the superiority of their
 product All this might be of zero interest except for two facts
 1 The GCOS people won the political war and this led in the
 orphaning and eventual death of Honeywell Multics and
 2 GECOSGCOS left one permanent mark on UNIX Some early UNIX
 systems at Bell Labs used GCOS machines for print spooling and
 various other services the field added to etcpasswd to
 carry GCOS ID information was called the GECOS field and
 survives today as the pw_gecos member used for the users
 full name and other humanID information GCOS later played a
 major role in keeping Honeywell a dismal alsoran in the mainframe
 market and was itself ditched for UNIX in the late 1980s when
 Honeywell retired its aging big iron designs

GECOS jeekohs n See GCOS

gedanken gdonkn adj Ungrounded impractical not
 wellthoughtout untried untested Gedanken is a German word
 for thought A thought experiment is one you carry out in your
 head In physics the term gedanken experiment is used to
 refer to an experiment that is impractical to carry out but useful
 to consider because you can reason about it theoretically A
 classic gedanken experiment of relativity theory involves thinking
 about a man in an elevator accelerating through space Gedanken
 experiments are very useful in physics but you have to be careful
 Its too easy to idealize away some important aspect of the real
 world in contructing your apparatus

 Among hackers accordingly the word has a pejorative connotation
 It is said of a project especially one in artificial intelligence
 research that is written up in grand detail typically as a PhD
 thesis without ever being implemented to any great extent Such a
 project is usually perpetrated by people who arent very good
 hackers or find programming distasteful or are just in a hurry A
 gedanken thesis is usually marked by an obvious lack of
 intuition about what is programmable and what is not and about
 what does and does not constitute a clear specification of an
 algorithm See also AIcomplete DWIM

 to be some confusion as to whether a male homosexual adapter has
 pins on both sides is male or sockets on both sides connects two
 males

General Public Virus n Pejorative name for some versions of the
 GNU project copyleft or General Public License GPL which
 requires that any tools or apps incorporating copylefted code
 must be sourcedistributed on the same countercommercial terms as
 GNU stuff Thus it is alleged that the copyleft infects software
 generated with GNU tools which may in turn infect other software
 that reuses any of its code The Free Software Foundations
 official position as of January 1991 is that copyright law limits
 the scope of the GPL to programs textually incorporating
 significant amounts of GNU code and that the infection is not
 passed on to third parties unless actual GNU source is transmitted
 as in for example use of the Bison parser skeleton
 Nevertheless widespread suspicion that the copyleft language
 is boobytrapped has caused many developers to avoid using GNU
 tools and the GPL Recent July 1991 changes in the language of
 the version 200 license may eliminate this problem

generate vt To produce something according to an algorithm or
 program or set of rules or as a possibly unintended side effect
 of the execution of an algorithm or program The opposite of

Get a life imp Hackerstandard way of suggesting that the person
 to whom you are speaking has succumbed to terminal geekdom see

 theology too seriously This exhortation was popularized by
 William Shatner on a Saturday Night Live episode in a speech that
 ended Get a life but some respondents believe it to
 have been in use before then It was certainly in wide use among
 hackers for at least five years before achieving mainstream
 currency around early 1992

Get a real computer imp Typical hacker response to news that
 somebody is having trouble getting work done on a system that
 a is singletasking b has no hard disk or c has an address
 space smaller than 4 megabytes This is as of mid1991 note that

glitch glich from German glitschen to slip via Yiddish
 glitshen to slide or skid 1 n A sudden interruption in
 electric service sanity continuity or program function
 Sometimes recoverable An interruption in electric service is
 specifically called a power glitch also power hit This
 is of grave concern because it usually crashes all the computers
 In jargon though a hacker who got to the middle of a sentence and
 then forgot how he or she intended to complete it might say
 Sorry I just glitched 2 vi To commit a glitch See
 gritch 3 vt Stanford To scroll a display screen esp
 several lines at a time WAITS terminals used to do this in
 order to avoid continuous scrolling which is distracting to the
 eye 4 obs Same as magic cookie sense 2

 All these uses of glitch derive from the specific technical
 meaning the term has in the electronic hardware world where it is
 now techspeak A glitch can occur when the inputs of a circuit
 change and the outputs change to some random value for some
 very brief time before they settle down to the correct value If
 another circuit inspects the output at just the wrong time reading
 the random value the results can be very wrong and very hard to
 debug a glitch is one of many causes of electronic heisenbugs

glob glob not glohb UNIX vtn To expand
 special characters in a wildcarded name or the act of so doing
 the action is also called globbing The UNIX conventions for
 filename wildcarding have become sufficiently pervasive that many
 hackers use some of them in written English especially in email or
 news on technical topics Those commonly encountered include the
 following

 
 wildcard for any string see also UNX

 
 wildcard for any character generally read this way only at
 the beginning or in the middle of a word

 
 delimits a wildcard matching any of the enclosed characters

 
 alternation of commaseparated alternatives thus
 foobazqux would be read as foobaz or fooqux

 Some examples He said his name was KCarl expresses
 ambiguity I dont read talkpolitics any of the
 talkpolitics subgroups on USENET Other examples are given
 under the entry for X Compare regexp

 Historical note The jargon usage derives from glob the
 name of a subprogram that expanded wildcards in archaic preBourne
 versions of the UNIX shell

glork glork 1 interj Term of mild surprise usually tinged with
 outrage as when one attempts to save the results of 2 hours of
 editing and finds that the system has just crashed 2 Used as a
 name for just about anything See foo 3 vt Similar to
 glitch but usually used reflexively My program just glorked
 itself See also glark

 for RMSs position that information is community property and all

 ball This was the technology that enabled APL to use a
 nonEBCDIC nonASCII and in fact completely nonstandard

 stayed firmly rooted for the next 20 until character displays
 gave way to programmable bitmapped devices with the flexibility to
 support other character sets

 of b into a and then executes code if
 a is nonzero What the programmer probably meant was
 if ab code which executes code if
 a and b are equal

 Decades ago back in the days when it was the sole supplier of
 longdistance hardcopy transmittal devices the Teletype
 Corporation was faced with a major design choice To shorten code
 lengths and cut complexity in the printing mechanism it had been
 decided that teletypes would use a monocase font either ALL UPPER
 or all lower The question was which one to choose A study was
 conducted on readability under various conditions of bad ribbon
 worn print hammers etc Lowercase won it is less dense and has
 more distinctive letterforms and is thus much easier to read both
 under ideal conditions and when the letters are mangled or partly
 obscured The results were filtered up through management
 The chairman of Teletype killed the proposal because it failed one
 incredibly important criterion

 It would be impossible to spell the name of the Deity
 correctly

 In this way or so at least hacker folklore has it superstition
 triumphed over utility Teletypes were the major input devices on
 most early computers and terminal manufacturers looking for
 corners to cut naturally followed suit until well into the 1970s
 Thus that one bad call stuck us with Great Runes for thirty years

 University Computer TRUC had a singlestepfreerun switch for
 use when debugging programs Since singlestepping through a large
 program was rather tedious there was also a crank with a cam and
 gear arrangement that repeatedly pushed the singlestep button

 down to singlestep for a bit when you got near the code of
 interest poke at some registers using the console typewriter and
 then keep on cranking

 H 


h from SF fandom infix A method of marking common words
 ie calling attention to the fact that they are being used in a
 nonstandard ironic or humorous way Originated in the fannish
 catchphrase Bheer is the One True Ghod from decades ago
 Hinfix marking of Ghod and other words spread into the 1960s
 counterculture via underground comix and into early hackerdom
 either from the counterculture or from SF fandom the three
 overlapped heavily at the time More recently the h infix has
 become an expected feature of benchmark names Dhrystone
 Rhealstone etc this is prob patterning on the original

 truth or truths that are constructed on injoke and selfparody
 This lexicon contains many examples of hahaonlyserious in both
 form and content Indeed the entirety of hacker culture is often

hack mode n 1 What one is in when hacking of course 2 More
 specifically a Zenlike state of total focus on The Problem that
 may be achieved when one is hacking this is why every good hacker
 is part mystic Ability to enter such concentration at will
 correlates strongly with wizardliness it is one of the most
 important skills learned during larval stage Sometimes
 amplified as deep hack mode

 Being yanked out of hack mode see priority interrupt may be
 experienced as a physical shock and the sensation of being in it
 is more than a little habituating The intensity of this
 experience is probably by itself sufficient explanation for the
 existence of hackers and explains why many resist being promoted
 out of positions where they can code See also cyberspace
 sense 2

 Some aspects of hackish etiquette will appear quite odd to an
 observer unaware of the high value placed on hack mode For
 example if someone appears at your door it is perfectly okay to
 hold up a hand without turning ones eyes away from the screen to
 avoid being interrupted One may read type and interact with the
 computer for quite some time before further acknowledging the
 others presence of course he or she is reciprocally free to
 leave without a word The understanding is that you might be in
 hack mode with a lot of delicate state sense 2 in your

 hacker network hacker See cracker

 The term hacker also tends to connote membership in the global
 community defined by the net see network the and
 Internet address It also implies that the person described
 is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ethic see
 hacker ethic the

 It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe
 oneself that way Hackers consider themselves something of an
 elite a meritocracy based on ability though one to which new
 members are gladly welcome There is thus a certain ego
 satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker but if
 you claim to be one and are not youll quickly be labeled
 bogus See also wannabee

hacker ethic the n 1 The belief that informationsharing
 is a powerful positive good and that it is an ethical duty of
 hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and
 facilitating access to information and to computing resources
 wherever possible 2 The belief that systemcracking for fun
 and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits
 no theft vandalism or breach of confidentiality

 Both of these normative ethical principles are widely but by no
 means universally accepted among hackers Most hackers subscribe
 to the hacker ethic in sense 1 and many act on it by writing and
 giving away free software A few go further and assert that
 all information should be free and any proprietary
 control of it is bad this is the philosophy behind the GNU
 project

 Sense 2 is more controversial some people consider the act of
 cracking itself to be unethical like breaking and entering
 But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who
 see themselves as benign crackers see also samurai On
 this view it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy
 to a break into a system and then b explain to the sysop
 preferably by email from a superuser account exactly how it
 was done and how the hole can be plugged  acting as an
 unpaid and unsolicited tiger team

 The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker
 ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share
 technical tricks software and where possible computing
 resources with other hackers Huge cooperative networks such as
 USENET Fidonet and Internet see Internet address
 can function without central control because of this trait they
 both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be
 hackerdoms most valuable intangible asset

 The adjective longhaired is wellattested to have been in
 slang use among scientists and engineers during the early 1950s it
 was equivalent to modern hairy senses 1 and 2 and was very
 likely ancestral to the hackish use In fact the noun
 longhair was at the time used to describe a person satisfying
 sense 3 Both senses probably passed out of use when long hair
 was adopted as a signature trait by the 1960s counterculture
 leaving hackish hairy as a sort of stunted mutant relic

HAKMEM hakmem n MIT AI Memo 239 February 1972 A
 legendary collection of neat mathematical and programming hacks
 contributed by many people at MIT and elsewhere The title of the
 memo really is HAKMEM which is a 6letterism for hacks
 memo Some of them are very useful techniques powerful
 theorems or interesting unsolved problems but most fall into the
 category of mathematical and computer trivia Here is a sampling
 of the entries with authors slightly paraphrased

 Item 41 Gene Salamin There are exactly 23000 prime numbers less
 than 218

 Item 46 Rich Schroeppel The most probable suit
 distribution in bridge hands is 4432 as compared to 4333
 which is the most evenly distributed This is because the
 world likes to have unequal numbers a thermodynamic effect saying
 things will not be in the state of lowest energy but in the state
 of lowest disordered energy

 Item 81 Rich Schroeppel Count the magic squares of order 5
 that is all the 5by5 arrangements of the numbers from 1 to 25
 such that all rows columns and diagonals add up to the same
 number There are about 320 million not counting those that
 differ only by rotation and reflection

 Item 154 Bill Gosper The myth that any given programming
 language is machine independent is easily exploded by computing the
 sum of powers of 2 If the result loops with period  1
 with sign  you are on a signmagnitude machine If the
 result loops with period  1 at 1 you are on a
 twoscomplement machine If the result loops with period greater
 than 1 including the beginning you are on a onescomplement
 machine If the result loops with period greater than 1 not
 including the beginning your machine isnt binary  the pattern
 should tell you the base If you run out of memory you are on a
 string or bignum system If arithmetic overflow is a fatal error
 some fascist pig with a readonly mind is trying to enforce machine
 independence But the very ability to trap overflow is machine
 dependent By this strategy consider the universe or more
 precisely algebra Let X  the sum of many powers of 2 
 111111 Now add X to itself
 X  X  111110 Thus 2X  X  1 so
 X  1 Therefore algebra is run on a machine the
 universe that is twoscomplement

 Item 174 Bill Gosper and Stuart Nelson 21963283741 is the only
 number such that if you represent it on the PDP10 as both an
 integer and a floatingpoint number the bit patterns of the two
 representations are identical

 Item 176 Gosper The banana phenomenon was encountered when
 processing a character string by taking the last 3 letters typed
 out searching for a random occurrence of that sequence in the
 text taking the letter following that occurrence typing it out
 and iterating This ensures that every 4letter string output
 occurs in the original The program typed BANANANANANANANA We
 note an ambiguity in the phrase the Nth occurrence of In one
 sense there are five 00s in 0000000000 in another there are
 nine The editing program TECO finds five Thus it finds only the
 first ANA in BANANA and is thus obligated to type N next By
 Murphys Law there is but one NAN thus forcing A and thus a
 loop An option to find overlapped instances would be useful
 although it would require backing up N  1 characters before
 seeking the next Ncharacter string

 Note This last item refers to a Dissociated Press
 implementation See also banana problem

 HAKMEM also contains some rather more complicated mathematical and
 technical items but these examples show some of its fun flavor

 coerce the compiler into generating better code Both the term and
 the practice are becoming uncommon See tune bum by
 hand syn with v cruft 2 More generally manual
 construction or patching of data sets that would normally be
 generated by a translation utility and interpreted by another
 program and arent really designed to be read or modified by
 humans

handle from CB slang n An electronic pseudonym a nom de
 guerre intended to conceal the users true identity Network and
 BBS handles function as the same sort of simultaneous concealment
 and display one finds on Citizens Band radio from which the term
 was adopted Use of grandiose handles is characteristic of
 crackers weenies spods and other lower forms of
 network life true hackers travel on their own reputations rather
 than invented legendry

handroll from obs mainstream slang handrolled in
 opposition to readymade referring to cigarettes v To
 perform a normally automated software installation or configuration
 process by hand implies that the normal process failed due to
 bugs in the configurator or was defeated by something exceptional
 in the local environment The worst thing about being a gateway
 between four different nets is having to handroll a new sendmail
 configuration every time any of them upgrades

handshaking n Hardware or software activity designed to start or
 keep two machines or programs in synchronization as they do
 protocol Often applied to human activity thus a hacker might
 watch two people in conversation nodding their heads to indicate
 that they have heard each others points and say Oh theyre
 handshaking See also protocol

handwave poss from gestures characteristic of stage magicians
 1 v To gloss over a complex point to distract a listener to
 support a possibly actually valid point with blatantly faulty
 logic 2 n The act of handwaving Boy what a handwave

 If someone starts a sentence with Clearly or
 Obviously or It is selfevident that it is
 a good bet he is about to handwave alternatively use of these
 constructions in a sarcastic tone before a paraphrase of someone
 elses argument suggests that it is a handwave The theory behind
 this term is that if you wave your hands at the right moment the
 listener may be sufficiently distracted to not notice that what you
 have said is bogus Failing that if a listener does object
 you might try to dismiss the objection with a wave of your hand

 The use of this word is often accompanied by gestures both hands
 up palms forward swinging the hands in a vertical plane pivoting
 at the elbows andor shoulders depending on the magnitude of the
 handwave alternatively holding the forearms in one position
 while rotating the hands at the wrist to make them flutter In
 context the gestures alone can suffice as a remark if a speaker
 makes an outrageously unsupported assumption you might simply wave
 your hands in this way as an accusation far more eloquent than
 words could express that his logic is faulty

hang v 1 To wait for an event that will never occur The
 system is hanging because it cant read from the crashed drive
 See wedged hung 2 To wait for some event to occur to
 hang around until something happens The program displays a menu
 and then hangs until you type a character Compare block

 something that is strictly inside the machines chassis

Hanlons Razor prov A corollary of Finagles Law similar to
 Occams Razor that reads Never attribute to malice that which can
 be adequately explained by stupidity The derivation of the
 common title Hanlons Razor is unknown a similar epigram has been
 attributed to William James Quoted here because it seems to be a
 particular favorite of hackers often showing up in fortune
 cookie files and the login banners of BBS systems and commercial
 networks This probably reflects the hackers daily experience of
 environments created by wellintentioned but shortsighted people

happily adv Of software used to emphasize that a program is
 unaware of some important fact about its environment either
 because it has been fooled into believing a lie or because it
 doesnt care The sense of happy here is not that of elation
 but rather that of blissful ignorance The program continues to
 run happily unaware that its output is going to devnull

haque hak USENET n Variant spelling of hack used
 only for the noun form and connoting an elegant hack

hard boot n See boot

hardcoded adj 1 Said of data inserted directly into a program
 where it cannot be easily modified as opposed to data in some
 profile resource see derezz sense 2 or environment
 variable that a user or hacker can easily modify 2 In C
 this is esp applied to use of a literal instead of a

 hardware The system is hardwarily unreliable The adjective
 hardwary is not traditionally used though it has recently
 been reported from the UK See softwarily

hash bucket n A notional receptacle into which more than one
 thing accessed by the same key or short code might be dropped
 When you look up a name in the phone book for example you
 typically hash it by extracting its first letter the hash buckets
 are the alphabetically ordered letter sections This is used as
 techspeak with respect to code that uses actual hash functions in
 jargon it is used for human associative memory as well Thus two
 things in the same hash bucket may be confused with each other
 If you hash English words only by length you get too many common
 grammar words in the first couple of hash buckets Compare hash
 collision

hash collision from the technical usage n var hash
 clash When used of people signifies a confusion in associative
 memory or imagination especially a persistent one see
 thinko True story One of us ESR was once on the phone
 with a friend about to move out to Berkeley When asked what he
 expected Berkeley to be like the friend replied Well I have
 this mental picture of naked women throwing Molotov cocktails but
 I think thats just a collision in my hash tables Compare

HCF HCF n Mnemonic for Halt and Catch Fire any of
 several undocumented and semimythical machine instructions with
 destructive sideeffects supposedly included for test purposes on
 several wellknown architectures going as far back as the IBM 360
 The MC6800 microprocessor was the first for which an HCF opcode
 became widely known This instruction caused the processor to
 toggle a subset of the bus lines as rapidly as it could in
 some configurations this could actually cause lines to burn
 up

 synchronization signal used by software or hardware such as a bus
 clock or a periodic interrupt 3 The natural oscillation
 frequency of a computers clock crystal before frequency division
 down to the machines clock rate 4 A signal emitted at regular
 intervals by software to demonstrate that it is still alive
 Sometimes hardware is designed to reboot the machine if it stops
 hearing a heartbeat See also breathoflife packet

heatseeker IBM n A customer who can be relied upon to always
 buy the latest version of an existing product not quite the same
 as a member the lunatic fringe A 1992 example of a
 heatseeker is someone who owning a 286 PC and Windows 30 goes
 out and buys Windows 31 which offers no worthwhile benefits
 unless you have a 386 If all customers were heatseekers vast
 amounts of money could be made by just fixing the bugs in each
 release n and selling it to them as release n1

heavy metal Cambridge n Syn big iron

heavy wizardry n Code or designs that trade on a particularly
 intimate knowledge or experience of a particular operating system
 or language or complex application interface Distinguished from
 deep magic which trades more on arcane theoretical
 knowledge Writing device drivers is heavy wizardry so is
 interfacing to X sense 2 without a toolkit Esp found in
 comments similar to Heavy wizardry begins here  Compare

heavyweight adj Highoverhead baroque codeintensive
 featureful but costly Esp used of communication protocols
 language designs and any sort of implementation in which maximum
 generality andor ease of implementation has been pushed at the
 expense of mundane considerations such as speed memory
 utilization and startup time EMACS is a heavyweight editor

 that is deaf dumb and blind ie accepting no input and
 generating no output usually due to an infinite loop or some other
 excursion into deep space Unfair to the real Helen Keller

 reboot the machine This isnt strictly speaking a crash

hello sailor interj Occasional West Coast equivalent of
 hello world seems to have originated at SAIL later
 associated with the game Zork which also included hello

hello wall excl See wall

hello world interj 1 The canonical minimal test message in the
 CUNIX universe 2 Any of the minimal programs that emit this
 message Traditionally the first program a C coder is supposed to
 write in a new environment is one that just prints hello world
 to standard output and indeed it is the first example program
 in KR Environments that generate an unreasonably large
 executable for this trivial test or which require a hairy
 compilerlinker invocation to generate it are considered to

hex n 1 Short for hexadecimal base 16 2 A 6pack
 of anything compare quad sense 2 Neither usage has
 anything to do with magic or black art though the pun is
 appreciated and occasionally used by hackers True story As a
 joke some hackers once offered some surplus ICs for sale to be
 worn as protective amulets against hostile magic The chips were
 of course hex inverters

hexadecimal n Base 16 Coined in the early 1960s to replace
 earlier sexadecimal which was too racy and amusing for stuffy
 IBM and later adopted by the rest of the industry

 Actually neither term is etymologically pure If we take binary
 to be paradigmatic the most etymologically correct term for
 base 10 for example is denary which
 comes from deni ten at a time ten each a Latin distributive
 number the corresponding term for base16 would be something like
 sendenary Decimal is from an ordinal number the
 corresponding prefix for 6 would imply something like
 sextidecimal The sexa prefix is Latin but incorrect in this
 context and hexa is Greek The word octal is similarly
 incorrect a correct form would be octaval to go with decimal
 or octonary to go with binary If anyone ever implements a
 base3 computer computer scientists will be faced with the
 unprecedented dilemma of a choice between two correct forms
 both ternary and trinary have a claim to this throne

hidden flag scientific computation n An extra option added to a
 routine without changing the calling sequence For example
 instead of adding an explicit input variable to instruct a routine
 to give extra diagnostic output the programmer might just add a
 test for some otherwise meaningless feature of the existing inputs
 such as a negative mass Liberal use of hidden flags can make a
 program very hard to debug and understand

 outlasted the PDP10 for example at the 1990 Washington DC
 Area Science Fiction Conclave Disclave when a miscommunication
 resulted in two separate wakes being held in commemoration of the
 shutdown of MITs last ITS machines the one on the upper

 seem to eat far more than their share of a systems resources
 esp those which noticeably degrade interactive response
 Not used of programs that are simply extremely large or
 complex or that are merely painfully slow themselves see pig
 run like a More often than not encountered in qualified forms
 eg memory hog core hog hog the processor hog
 the disk A controller that never gives up the IO bus
 gets killed after the bushog timer expires 2 Also said
 of people who use more than their fair share of resources
 particularly disk where it seems that 10 of the people use 90

holy wars from USENET but may predate it n flame
 wars over religious issues The paper by Danny Cohen that
 popularized the terms bigendian and littleendian in
 connection with the LSBfirstMSBfirst controversy was entitled
 On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace Other perennial Holy
 Wars have included EMACS vs vi my personal computer vs
 everyone elses personal computer ITS vs UNIX
 UNIX vs VMS BSD UNIX vs USG UNIX C vs

hook n A software or hardware feature included in order to
 simplify later additions or changes by a user For example a
 simple program that prints numbers might always print them in base
 10 but a more flexible version would let a variable determine what
 base to use setting the variable to 5 would make the program print
 numbers in base 5 The variable is a simple hook An even more
 flexible program might examine the variable and treat a value of 16
 or less as the base to use but treat any other number as the
 address of a usersupplied routine for printing a number This is
 a hairy but powerful hook one can then write a routine to
 print numbers as Roman numerals say or as Hebrew characters and
 plug it into the program through the hook Often the difference
 between a good program and a superb one is that the latter has
 useful hooks in judiciously chosen places Both may do the
 original job about equally well but the one with the hooks is much
 more flexible for future expansion of capabilities EMACS for
 example is all hooks The term user exit is
 synonymous but much more formal and less hackish

hop n One file transmission in a series required to get a file
 from point A to point B on a storeandforward network On such
 networks including UUCPNET and FidoNet the important
 intermachine metric is the number of hops in the shortest path
 between them rather than their geographical separation See
 bang path

hose 1 vt To make nonfunctional or greatly degraded in
 performance That big raytracing program really hoses the
 system See hosed 2 n A narrow channel through which
 data flows under pressure Generally denotes data paths that
 represent performance bottlenecks 3 n Cabling especially
 thick Ethernet cable This is sometimes called bit hose or
 hosery play on hosiery or etherhose See also
 washing machine

hosed adj Same as down Used primarily by UNIX hackers
 Humorous also implies a condition thought to be relatively easy to
 reverse Probably derived from the Canadian slang hoser
 popularized by the Bob and Doug Mackenzie skits on SCTV See
 hose It is also widely used of people in the mainstream sense
 of in an extremely unfortunate situation

 Once upon a time a Cray that had been experiencing periodic
 difficulties crashed and it was announced to have been hosed
 It was discovered that the crash was due to the disconnection of
 some coolant hoses The problem was corrected and users were then
 assured that everything was OK because the system had been rehosed
 See also dehose

hot spot n 1 primarily used by CUNIX programmers but
 spreading It is received wisdom that in most programs less than
 10 of the code eats 90 of the execution time if one were to
 graph instruction visits versus code addresses one would typically
 see a few huge spikes amidst a lot of lowlevel noise Such spikes
 are called hot spots and are good candidates for heavy
 optimization or handhacking The term is especially used of
 tight loops and recursions in the codes central algorithm as
 opposed to say initial setup costs or large but infrequent IO
 operations See tune bum handhacking 2 The
 active location of a cursor on a bitmap display Put the
 mouses hot spot on the ON widget and click the left button
 3 A screen region that is sensitive to mouse clicks which trigger
 some action Hypertext help screens are an example in which a hot
 spot exists in the vicinity of any word for which additional
 material is available 4 In a massively parallel computer with
 shared memory the one location that all 10000 processors are
 trying to read or write at once perhaps because they are all doing
 a busywait on the same lock

 portability problems HPUX is often referred to as hockeypux
 inside HP and one respondent claims that the proper pronunciation
 is HP ukkkhhhh as though one were about to spit Another such
 alternate spelling and pronunciation is HPUX Hpuhks
 Hackers at HPApollo the former Apollo Computers which was
 swallowed by HP in 1989 have been heard to complain that

 important to say something The word apparently originated at
 least with this definition on the MECC Timeshare System MTS a

 during the 1970s and the early 1980s but was later sighted on
 early UNIX systems

Humor Hacker n A distinctive style of shared intellectual
 humor found among hackers having the following marked
 characteristics

 1 Fascination with formvscontent jokes paradoxes and humor
 having to do with confusion of metalevels see meta One way
 to make a hacker laugh hold a red index card in front of himher
 with GREEN written on it or viceversa note however that
 this is funny only the first time

 2 Elaborate deadpan parodies of large intellectual constructs
 such as specifications see writeonly memory standards
 documents language descriptions see INTERCAL and even
 entire scientific theories see quantum bogodynamics
 computron

 3 Jokes that involve screwily precise reasoning from bizarre
 ludicrous or just grossly counterintuitive premises

 4 Fascination with puns and wordplay

 5 A fondness for apparently mindless humor with subversive
 currents of intelligence in it  for example old Warner Brothers
 and Rocky  Bullwinkle cartoons the Marx brothers the early
 B52s and Monty Pythons Flying Circus Humor that combines this
 trait with elements of high camp and slapstick is especially
 favored

hung from hung up adj Equivalent to wedged but more
 common at UNIXC sites Not generally used of people Syn with
 locked up wedged compare hosed See also hang
 A hung state is distinguished from crashed or down where the
 program or system is also unusable but because it is not running
 rather than because it is waiting for something However the
 recovery from both situations is often the same

hyperspace hiperspays n A memory location that is far
 away from where the program counter should be pointing often
 inaccessible because it is not even mapped in Another core
 dump  looks like the program jumped off to hyperspace
 somehow Compare jump off into nevernever land This
 usage is from the SF notion of a spaceship jumping into
 hyperspace that is taking a shortcut through higherdimensional
 space  in other words bypassing this universe The variant
 east hyperspace is recorded among CMU and Bliss hackers

 I 


I didnt change anything interj An aggrieved cry often heard as
 bugs manifest during a regression test The canonical reply to
 this assertion is Then it works just the same as it did before
 doesnt it See also oneline fix This is also heard from
 applications programmers trying to blame an obvious applications
 problem on an unrelated systems software change for example a
 divideby0 fault after terminals were added to a network
 Usually their statement is found to be false Upon close
 questioning they will admit some major restructuring of the
 program that shouldnt have broken anything in their opinion
 but which actually hosed the code completely

I see no X here Hackers and the interactive computer games they
 write traditionally favor this slightly marked usage over other
 possible equivalents such as Theres no X here or X is
 missing or Wheres the X This goes back to the original
 PDP10 ADVENT which would respond in this wise if you asked
 it to do something involving an object not present at your location
 in the game

IBM IBM Inferior But Marketable Its Better Manually
 Insidious Black Magic Its Been Malfunctioning Incontinent Bowel
 Movement and a nearinfinite number of even less complimentary
 expansions including International Business Machines See
 TLA These abbreviations illustrate the considerable
 antipathy most hackers have long felt toward the industry leader
 see fear and loathing

 What galls hackers about most IBM machines above the PC level isnt
 so much that they are underpowered and overpriced though that does
 count against them but that the designs are incredibly archaic
 crufty and elephantine  and you cant fix them
  source code is locked up tight and programming tools are
 expensive hard to find and bletcherous to use once youve found
 them With the release of the UNIXbased RIOS family this may have
 begun to change  but then we thought that when the PCRT came
 out too

 In the spirit of universal peace and brotherhood this lexicon now
 includes a number of entries attributed to IBM these derive from
 some rampantly unofficial jargon lists circulated within IBMs own
 beleaguered hacker underground

IBM discount n A price increase Outside IBM this derives from
 the common perception that IBM products are generally overpriced
 see clone inside it is said to spring from a belief that
 large numbers of IBM employees living in an area cause prices to
 rise

ICBM address n Also missile address The form used to
 register a site with the USENET mapping project includes a blank
 for longitude and latitude preferably to secondsofarc accuracy
 This is actually used for generating geographicallycorrect maps of
 USENET links on a plotter however it has become traditional to
 refer to this as ones ICBM address or missile address and
 many people include it in their sig block with that name

ice coined by USENETter Tom Maddox popularized by William
 Gibsons cyberpunk SF novels a contrived acronym for Intrusion
 Countermeasure Electronics Security software in Gibsons novels
 software that responds to intrusion by attempting to literally kill
 the intruder Also icebreaker a program designed for
 cracking security on a system Neither term is in serious use yet
 as of mid1991 but many hackers find the metaphor attractive and
 each may develop a denotation in the future

idempotent from mathematical techspeak adj Acting exactly
 once This term is often used with respect to C header files
 which contain common definitions and declarations to be included by
 several source files If a header file is ever included twice
 during the same compilation perhaps due to nested include
 files compilation errors can result unless the header file has
 protected itself against multiple inclusion a header file so
 protected is said to be idempotent The term can also be used to
 describe an initialization subroutine which is arranged to perform
 some critical action exactly once even if the routine is called
 several times

If you want X you know where to find it There is a legend that
 Dennis Ritchie inventor of C once responded to demands for
 features resembling those of what at the time was a much more
 popular language by observing If you want PL1 you know where to

illbehaved adj 1 numerical analysis Said of an algorithm or
 computational method that tends to blow up because of accumulated
 roundoff error or poor convergence properties 2 Software that
 bypasses the defined OS interfaces to do things like screen
 keyboard and disk IO itself often in a way that depends on the
 hardware of the machine it is running on or which is nonportable or
 incompatible with other pieces of software In the IBM PCMSDOS
 world there is a folk theorem nearly true to the effect that
 owing to gross inadequacies and performance penalties in the OS
 interface all interesting applications are illbehaved See also
 bare metal Oppose wellbehaved compare PCism See
 messdos

IMHO  from SF fandom via USENET abbreviation for In My Humble

Imminent Death Of The Net Predicted USENET prov Since USENET
 first got off the ground in 198081 it has grown exponentially
 approximately doubling in size every year On the other hand most
 people feel the signaltonoise ratio of USENET has dropped
 steadily These trends led as far back as mid1983 to predictions of
 the imminent collapse or death of the net Ten years and
 numerous doublings later enough of these gloomy prognostications
 have been confounded that the phrase Imminent Death Of The Net
 Predicted has become a running joke hauled out any time someone
 grumbles about the SN ratio or the huge and steadily
 increasing volume

in the extreme adj A preferred superlative suffix for many hackish
 terms See for example obscure in the extreme under obscure
 and compare highly

incantation n Any particularly arbitrary or obscure command that
 one must mutter at a system to attain a desired result Not used
 of passwords or other explicit security features Especially used
 of tricks that are so poorly documented they must be learned from a
 wizard This compiler normally locates initialized data
 in the data segment but if you mutter the right incantation they
 will be forced into text space

include vt USENET 1 To duplicate a portion or whole of
 anothers message typically with attribution to the source in a
 reply or followup for clarifying the context of ones response
 See the the discussion of inclusion styles under Hacker
 Writing Style 2 from C include disclaimerh
 has appeared in sig blocks to refer to a notional standard
 disclaimer file

include war n Excessive multileveled including within a
 discussion thread a practice that tends to annoy readers In
 a forum with hightraffic newsgroups such as USENET this can lead
 to flames and the urge to start a kill file

indent style C programmers n The rules one uses to indent code
 in a readable fashion a subject of holy wars There are four
 major C indent styles described below all have the aim of
 making it easier for the reader to visually track the scope of
 control constructs The significant variable is the placement of
  and  with respect to the statements they
 enclose and the guard or controlling statement if
 else for while or do on the block
 if any

 KR style  Named after Kernighan  Ritchie because the
 examples in KR are formatted this way Also called kernel
 style because the UNIX kernel is written in it and the One True
 Brace Style abbrev 1TBS by its partisans The basic indent
 shown here is eight spaces or one tab per level four are
 occasionally seen but are much less common

 if cond 
 body
 

 Allman style  Named for Eric Allman a Berkeley hacker who
 wrote a lot of the BSD utilities in it it is sometimes called
 BSD style Resembles normal indent style in Pascal and Algol
 Basic indent per level shown here is eight spaces but four is just
 as common esp in C code

 if cond
 
 body
 

 Whitesmiths style  popularized by the examples that came
 with Whitesmiths C an early commercial C compiler Basic indent
 per level shown here is eight spaces but four is occasionally
 seen

 if cond
 
 body
 

 GNU style  Used throughout GNU EMACS and the Free Software
 Foundation code and just about nowhere else Indents are always
 four spaces per level with  and  halfway between the
 outer and inner indent levels

 if cond
 
 body
 

 Surveys have shown the Allman and Whitesmiths styles to be the most
 common with about equal mind shares KR1TBS used to be nearly
 universal but is now much less common the opening brace tends to
 get lost against the right paren of the guard part in an if
 or while which is a Bad Thing Defenders of 1TBS
 argue that any putative gain in readability is less important than
 their styles relative economy with vertical space which enables
 one to see more code on ones screen at once Doubtless these
 issues will continue to be the subject of holy wars

index n See coefficient of X

infant mortality n It is common lore among hackers and in the
 electronics industry at large this term is possibly techspeak by
 now that the chances of sudden hardware failure drop off
 exponentially with a machines time since powerup that is until
 the relatively distant time at which enough mechanical wear in IO
 devices and thermalcycling stress in components has accumulated
 for the machine to start going senile Up to half of all chip and
 wire failures happen within a new systems first few weeks such
 failures are often referred to as infant mortality problems
 or occasionally as sudden infant death syndrome See
 bathtub curve burnin period

infinite adj Consisting of a large number of objects extreme
 Used very loosely as in This program produces infinite
 garbage He is an infinite loser The word most likely to
 follow infinite though is hair it has been pointed out
 that fractals are an excellent example of infinite hair These
 uses are abuses of the words mathematical meaning The term
 semiinfinite denoting an immoderately large amount of some
 resource is also heard This compiler is taking a semiinfinite
 amount of time to optimize my program See also semi

infinite loop n One that never terminates that is the machine
 spins or buzzes forever and goes catatonic There
 is a standard joke that has been made about each generations
 exemplar of the ultrafast machine The Cray3 is so fast it can
 execute an infinite loop in under 2 seconds

infinity n 1 The largest value that can be represented in a
 particular type of variable register memory location data type
 whatever 2 minus infinity The smallest such value not
 necessarily or even usually the simple negation of plus infinity
 In Nbit twoscomplement arithmetic infinity is
 2N1  1 but minus infinity is  2N1
 not 2N1  1 Note also that this is different from
 time T equals minus infinity which is closer to a
 mathematicians usage of infinity

initgame initgaym IRC n An IRC version of the
 venerable trivia game 20 questions in which one user changes
 his nick to the initials of a famous person or other named
 entity and the others on the channel ask yes or no questions with
 the one to guess the person getting to be it next As a
 courtesy the one picking the initials starts by providing a
 4letter hint of the form sex nationality lifestatus

 Real as opposed to fictional Initgame can be surprisingly
 addictive See also hing

INTERCAL intrkal said by the authors to stand for
 Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym n A
 computer language designed by Don Woods and James Lyon in 1972
 INTERCAL is purposely different from all other computer
 languages in all ways but one it is purely a written language
 being totally unspeakable An excerpt from the INTERCAL Reference
 Manual will make the style of the language clear

 It is a wellknown and oftdemonstrated fact that a person whose
 work is incomprehensible is held in high esteem For example if
 one were to state that the simplest way to store a value of 65536
 in a 32bit INTERCAL variable is

 DO 1  0256

 any sensible programmer would say that that was absurd Since this
 is indeed the simplest method the programmer would be made to look
 foolish in front of his boss who would of course have happened to
 turn up as bosses are wont to do The effect would be no less
 devastating for the programmer having been correct

 INTERCAL has many other peculiar features designed to make it even
 more unspeakable The WoodsLyons implementation was actually used
 by many well at least several people at Princeton The language
 has been recently reimplemented as CINTERCAL and is consequently
 enjoying an unprecedented level of unpopularity there is even an
 altlangintercal newsgroup devoted to the study and 
 appreciation of the language on USENET

interesting adj In hacker parlance this word has strong
 connotations of annoying or difficult or both Hackers
 relish a challenge and enjoy wringing all the irony possible out
 of the ancient Chinese curse May you live in interesting times
 Oppose trivial uninteresting

Internet address n 1 techspeak An absolute network address of
 the form foobarbaz where foo is a user name bar is a
 sitename and baz is a domain name possibly including
 periods itself Contrast with bang path see also network
 the and network address All Internet machines and most UUCP
 sites can now resolve these addresses thanks to a large amount of
 behindthescenes magic and PD software written since 1980 or so
 See also bang path domainist 2 More loosely any
 network address reachable through Internet this includes bang
 path addresses and some internal corporate and government
 networks

 Reading Internet addresses is something of an art Here are the
 four most important toplevel functional Internet domains followed
 by a selection of geographical domains

 com
 commercial organizations
 edu
 educational institutions
 gov
 US government civilian sites
 mil
 US military sites

 Note that most of the sites in the com and edu domains are in
 the US or Canada

 us
 sites in the US outside the functional domains
 su
 sites in the exSoviet Union see kremvax
 uk
 sites in the United Kingdom

 Within the us domain there are subdomains for the fifty
 states each generally with a name identical to the states postal
 abbreviation Within the uk domain there is an ac subdomain for
 academic sites and a co domain for commercial ones Other
 toplevel domains may be divided up in similar ways

interrupt 1 techspeak n On a computer an event that
 interrupts normal processing and temporarily diverts
 flowofcontrol through an interrupt handler routine See also
 trap 2 interj A request for attention from a hacker
 Often explicitly spoken Interrupt  have you seen Joe
 recently See priority interrupt 3 Under MSDOS the
 term interrupt is nearly synonymous with system call because
 the OS and BIOS routines are both called using the INT instruction
 see interrupt list the and because programmers so often have
 to bypass the OS going directly to a BIOS interrupt to get
 reasonable performance

interrupt list the MSDOS n The list of all known software
 interrupt calls both documented and undocumented for IBM PCs and
 compatibles maintained and made available for free redistribution
 by Ralf Brown ralfcscmuedu As of early 1991 it had grown to
 approximately a megabyte in length

interrupts locked out adj When someone is ignoring you In a
 restaurant after several fruitless attempts to get the waitresss
 attention a hacker might well observe She must have interrupts
 locked out The synonym interrupts disabled is also common
 Variations abound to have ones interrupt mask bit set and
 interrupts masked out is also heard See also spl

IRC IRC Internet Relay Chat n A worldwide party
 line network that allows one to converse with others in real
 time IRC is structured as a network of Internet servers each of
 which accepts connections from client programs one per user The
 IRC community and the USENET and MUD communities overlap
 to some extent including both hackers and regular folks who have
 discovered the wonders of computer networks Some USENET jargon
 has been adopted on IRC as have some conventions such as
 emoticons There is also a vigorous native jargon
 represented in this lexicon by entries marked IRC See also

 mainframe class with big metal cabinets housing relatively
 lowdensity electronics but the term is also used of modern
 supercomputers Often in the phrase big iron Oppose
 silicon See also dinosaur

Iron Age n In the history of computing 19611971  the
 formative era of commercial mainframe technology when big

ITS ITS n 1 Incompatible Timesharing System an
 influential but highly idiosyncratic operating system written for
 PDP6s and PDP10s at MIT and long used at the MIT AI Lab Much
 AIhacker jargon derives from ITS folklore and to have been an
 ITS hacker qualifies one instantly as an oldtimer of the most
 venerable sort ITS pioneered many important innovations
 including transparent file sharing between machines and
 terminalindependent IO After about 1982 most actual work was
 shifted to newer machines with the remaining ITS boxes run
 essentially as a hobby and service to the hacker community The
 shutdown of the labs last ITS machine in May 1990 marked the end
 of an era and sent oldtime hackers into mourning nationwide see
 high moby The Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden is
 maintaining one live ITS site at its computer museum right next
 to the only TOPS10 system still on the Internet so ITS is still
 alleged to hold the record for OS in longest continuous use
 however WAITS is a credible rival for this palm See
 appendix A 2 A mythical image of operatingsystem perfection
 worshiped by a bizarre fervent retrocult of oldtime hackers and
 exusers see troglodyte sense 2 ITS worshipers manage
 somehow to continue believing that an OS maintained by

JCL JCL n 1 IBMs supremely rude Job Control
 Language JCL is the script language used to control the execution
 of programs in IBMs batch systems JCL has a very fascist
 syntax and some versions will for example barf if two
 spaces appear where it expects one Most programmers confronted
 with JCL simply copy a working file or card deck changing the
 file names Someone who actually understands and generates unique
 JCL is regarded with the mixed respect one gives to someone who
 memorizes the phone book It is reported that hackers at IBM
 itself sometimes sing Whos the breeder of the crud that mangles
 you and me IBM JCL Mouse to the tune of the
 Mickey Mouse Club theme to express their opinion of the
 beast 2 A comparative for any very rude software that a
 hacker is expected to use Thats as bad as JCL As with
 COBOL JCL is often used as an archetype of ugliness even by
 those who havent experienced it See also IBM fear and

JEDR  n Synonymous with IYFEG At one time people in
 the USENET newsgroup rechumorfunny tended to use JEDR
 instead of IYFEG or ethnic this stemmed from a public
 attempt to suppress the group once made by a loser with initials
 JEDR after he was offended by an ethnic joke posted there The
 practice was retconned by the expanding these initials as
 Joke EthnicDenominationRace After much sound and fury JEDR
 faded away this term appears to be doing likewise JEDRs only
 permanent effect on the netculture was to discredit
 sensitivity arguments for censorship so thoroughly that more
 recent attempts to raise them have met with immediate and

job security n When some piece of code is written in a
 particularly obscure fashion and no good reason such as time
 or space optimization can be discovered it is often said that the
 programmer was attempting to increase his job security ie by

klone klohn n See clone sense 4

kludge kluhj n Common but incorrect variant of kluge qv

kluge klooj from the German klug clever 1 n A Rube
 Goldberg or Heath Robinson device whether in hardware or
 software A longago Datamation article by Jackson Granholme
 said An illassorted collection of poorly matching parts
 forming a distressing whole 2 n A clever programming trick
 intended to solve a particular nasty case in an expedient if not
 clear manner Often used to repair bugs Often involves
 adhockery and verges on being a crock In fact the
 TMRC Dictionary defined kludge as a crock that works 3 n
 Something that works for the wrong reason 4 vt To insert a
 kluge into a program Ive kluged this routine to get around
 that weird bug but theres probably a better way 5 WPI n A
 feature that is implemented in a rude manner

 Nowadays this term is often encountered in the variant spelling
 kludge Reports from old farts are consistent that
 kluge was the original spelling reported around computers as
 far back as the mid1950s and at that time used exclusively of
 hardware kluges In 1947 the New York Folklore
 Quarterly reported a classic shaggydog story Murgatroyd the
 Kluge Maker then current in the Armed Forces in which a kluge
 was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function

 However there is reason to believe this slang use may be a decade
 older Several respondents have connected it to the brand name of
 a device called a Kluge paper feeder dating back at least to
 1935 an adjunct to mechanical printing presses The Kluge feeder
 was designed before small cheap electric motors and control
 electronics it relied on a fiendishly complex assortment of cams
 belts and linkages to both power and synchronize all its
 operations from one motive driveshaft It was accordingly
 tempermental subject to frequent breakdowns and devilishly
 difficult to repair  but oh so clever One traditional
 folk etymology of kluge makes it the name of a design engineer
 in fact Kluge is a surname in German and the designer of the
 Kluge feeder may well have been the man behind this myth

 The variant kludge was apparently popularized by the
 Datamation article mentioned above it was titled How
 to Design a Kludge February 1962 pages 30 and 31 Some people
 who encountered the word first in print or online jumped to the
 reasonable but incorrect conclusion that the word should be
 pronounced kluhj rhyming with sludge The result of this
 tangled history is a mess in 1991 many perhaps even most
 hackers pronounce the word correctly as klooj but spell it
 incorrectly as kludge compare the pronunciation drift of
 mung Some observers consider this appropriate in view of
 its meaning

kluge around vt To avoid a bug or difficult condition by
 inserting a kluge Compare workaround

kluge up vt To lash together a quick hack to perform a task this
 is milder than cruft together and has some of the connotations
 of hack up note however that the construction kluge on
 corresponding to hack on is never used Ive kluged up this

kremvax kremvaks from the then large number of USENET
 VAXen with names of the form foovax n Originally a
 fictitious USENET site at the Kremlin announced on April 1 1984
 in a posting ostensibly originated there by Soviet leader
 Konstantin Chernenko The posting was actually forged by Piet
 Beertema as an April Fools joke Other fictitious sites mentioned
 in the hoax were moskvax and kgbvax This was probably
 the funniest of the many April Fools forgeries perpetrated on
 USENET which has negligible security against them because the
 notion that USENET might ever penetrate the Iron Curtain seemed so
 totally absurd at the time

 In fact it was only six years later that the first genuine site in
 Moscow demossu joined USENET Some readers needed
 convincing that the postings from it werent just another prank
 Vadim Antonov senior programmer at Demos and the major poster from
 there up to mid1991 was quite aware of all this referred to it
 frequently in his own postings and at one point twitted some
 credulous readers by blandly asserting that he was a
 hoax

 Eventually he even arranged to have the domains gateway site
 named kremvax thus neatly turning fiction into truth
 and demonstrating that the hackish sense of humor transcends
 cultural barriers Mr Antonov also contributed the
 Russianlanguage material for this lexicon  ESR

 In an even more ironic historical footnote kremvax became an
 electronic center of the anticommunist resistance during the
 bungled hardline coup of August 1991 During those three days the
 Soviet UUCP network centered on kremvax became the only
 trustworthy news source for many places within the USSR Though
 the sysops were concentrating on internal communications
 crossborder postings included immediate transliterations of Boris
 Yeltsins decrees condemning the coup and eyewitness reports of the
 demonstrations in Moscows streets In those hours years of
 speculation that totalitarianism would prove unable to maintain its
 grip on politicallyloaded information in the age of computer
 networking were proved devastatingly accurate  and the original
 kremvax joke became a reality as Yeltsin and the new Russian
 revolutionaries of glasnost and perestroika made
 kremvax one of the timeliest means of their outreach to the
 West

 also called a whoopee card Card readers tended to jam when
 they got to one of these as the resulting card had too little

language lawyer n A person usually an experienced or senior
 software engineer who is intimately familiar with many or most of
 the numerous restrictions and features both useful and esoteric
 applicable to one or more computer programming languages A
 language lawyer is distinguished by the ability to show you the

 together imply the answer to your question if only you had
 thought to look there Compare wizard legal
 legalese

languages of choice n C and LISP Nearly every
 hacker knows one of these and most good ones are fluent in both
 Smalltalk and Prolog are also popular in small but influential
 communities

 There is also a rapidly dwindling category of older hackers with
 FORTRAN or even assembler as their language of choice They
 often prefer to be known as real programmers and other
 hackers consider them a bit odd see The Story of Mel a
 Real Programmer in appendix A Assembler is generally no longer
 considered interesting or appropriate for anything but HLL
 implementation glue and a few timecritical and
 hardwarespecific uses in systems programs FORTRAN occupies a
 shrinking niche in scientific programming

 Most hackers tend to frown on languages like Pascal and
 Ada which dont give them the neartotal freedom considered
 necessary for hacking see bondageanddiscipline language
 and to regard everything thats even remotely connected with
 COBOL or other traditional card walloper languages as a
 total and unmitigated loss

larval stage n Describes a period of monomaniacal concentration
 on coding apparently passed through by all fledgling hackers
 Common symptoms include the perpetration of more than one 36hour
 hacking run in a given week neglect of all other activities
 including usual basics like food sleep and personal hygiene and
 a chronic case of advanced blearyeye Can last from 6 months to 2
 years the apparent median being around 18 months A few so
 afflicted never resume a more normal life but the ordeal
 seems to be necessary to produce really wizardly as opposed to
 merely competent programmers See also wannabee A less
 protracted and intense version of larval stage typically lasting
 about a month may recur when one is learning a new OS or
 programming language

lase layz vt To print a given document via a laser printer

laser chicken n Kung Pao Chicken a standard Chinese dish
 containing chicken peanuts and hot red peppers in a spicy
 pepperoil sauce Many hackers call it laser chicken for
 two reasons It can zap you just like a laser and the
 sauce has a red color reminiscent of some laser beams

 In a variation on this theme it is reported that some Australian
 hackers have redesignated the common dish lemon chicken as
 Chernobyl Chicken The name is derived from the color of the
 sauce which is considered bright enough to glow in the dark as
 mythically do some of the inhabitants of Chernobyl

Lasherism Harvard n A program which solves a standard problem
 such as the Eight Queens puzzle or implementing the life
 algorithm in a deliberately nonstandard way Distinguished from a
 crock or kluge by the fact that the programmer did it on
 purpose as a mental exercise Lew Lasher was a student at Harvard
 around 1980 who became notorious for such behavior

legal adj Loosely used to mean in accordance with all the
 relevant rules esp in connection with some set of constraints
 defined by software The older  alternate for  is no longer
 legal syntax in ANSI C This parser processes each line of
 legal input the moment it sees the trailing linefeed Hackers
 often model their work as a sort of game played with the
 environment in which the objective is to maneuver through the
 thicket of natural laws to achieve a desired objective Their
 use of legal is flavored as much by this gameplaying sense as by
 the more conventional one having to do with courts and lawyers
 Compare language lawyer legalese

legalese n Dense pedantic verbiage in a language description
 product specification or interface standard text that seems
 designed to obfuscate and requires a language lawyer to
 parse it Though hackers are not afraid of high information
 density and complexity in language indeed they rather enjoy
 both they share a deep and abiding loathing for legalese they
 associate it with deception suits and situations in which
 hackers generally get the short end of the stick

life n 1 A cellularautomata game invented by John Horton
 Conway and first introduced publicly by Martin Gardner
 Scientific American October 1970 the games popularity
 had to wait a few years for computers on which it could reasonably
 be played as its no fun to simulate the cells by hand Many
 hackers pass through a stage of fascination with it and hackers at
 various places contributed heavily to the mathematical analysis of
 this game most notably Bill Gosper at MIT who even implemented
 life in TECO see Gosperism When a hacker mentions
 life he is much more likely to mean this game than the
 magazine the breakfast cereal or the human state of existence

line eater the USENET n 1 A bug in some nowobsolete
 versions of the netnews software that used to eat up to BUFSIZ
 bytes of the article text The bug was triggered by having the
 text of the article start with a space or tab This bug was
 quickly personified as a mythical creature called the line
 eater and postings often included a dummy line of line eater
 food Ironically line eater food not beginning with a space or
 tab wasnt actually eaten since the bug was avoided but if there
 was a space or tab before it then the line eater would eat
 the food and the beginning of the text it was supposed to be
 protecting The practice of sacrificing to the line eater
 continued for some time after the bug had been nailed to the
 wall and is still humorously referred to The bug itself is
 still in mid1991 occasionally reported to be lurking in some
 mailtonetnews gateways 2 See NSA line eater

 interference or crosstalk from other circuits electrical storms
 cosmic rays or notionally birds crapping on the phone
 wires 2 Any chunk of data in a file or elsewhere that looks like
 the results of line noise in sense 1 3 Text that is
 theoretically a readable text or program source but employs syntax
 so bizarre that it looks like line noise in senses 1 or 2 Yes
 there are languages this ugly The canonical example is TECO
 it is often claimed that TECOs input syntax is indistinguishable
 from line noise Other nonWYSIWYG editors such as Multics
 qed and Unix ed in the hands of a real hacker also
 qualify easily as do deliberately obfuscated languages such as
 INTERCAL

line starve MIT 1 vi To feed paper through a printer the
 wrong way by one line most printers cant do this On a display
 terminal to move the cursor up to the previous line of the screen
 To print X squared you just output X line starve 2 line
 feed The line starve causes the 2 to appear on the line
 above the X and the line feed gets back to the original line
 2 n A character or character sequence that causes a terminal to
 perform this action ASCII 0011010 also called SUB or controlZ
 was one common linestarve character in the days before
 microcomputers and the X364 terminal standard Unlike line
 feed line starve is not standard ASCII
 terminology Even among hackers it is considered a bit silly
 3 proposed A sequence such as c used in System V echo as well
 as nrofftroff that suppresses a newline or other
 characters that would normally be emitted

link farm UNIX n A directory tree that contains many links to
 files in a master directory tree of files Link farms save space
 when for example one is maintaining several nearly identical
 copies of the same source tree eg when the only difference is
 architecturedependent object files Lets freeze the source and
 then rebuild the FROBOZZ3 and FROBOZZ4 link farms Link farms
 may also be used to get around restrictions on the number of
 I includefile directory arguments on older
 C preprocessors However they can also get completely out of
 hand becoming the filesystem equivalent of spaghetti code

linkdead MUD adj Said of a MUD character who has frozen in
 place because of a dropped Internet connection

lint from UNIXs lint1 named for the bits of fluff it
 picks from programs 1 vt To examine a program closely for style
 language usage and portability problems esp if in C esp if
 via use of automated analysis tools most esp if the UNIX
 utility lint1 is used This term used to be restricted to
 use of lint1 itself but judging by references on USENET
 it has become a shorthand for desk check at some nonUNIX
 shops even in languages other than C Also as v delint
 2 n Excess verbiage in a document as in this draft has too
 much lint

lion food IBM n Middle management or HQ staff by extension
 administrative drones in general From an old joke about two
 lions who escaping from the zoo split up to increase their
 chances but agreed to meet after 2 months When they finally
 meet one is skinny and the other overweight The thin one says
 How did you manage I ate a human just once and they turned out
 a small army to chase me  guns nets it was terrible Since
 then Ive been reduced to eating mice insects even grass The
 fat one replies Well I hid near an IBM office and ate a
 manager a day And nobody even noticed

Lions Book n Source Code and Commentary on UNIX level 6
 by John Lions The two parts of this book contained 1 the entire
 source listing of the UNIX Version 6 kernel and 2 a commentary
 on the source discussing the algorithms These were circulated
 internally at the University of New South Wales beginning 197677
 and were for years after the only detailed kernel
 documentation available to anyone outside Bell Labs Because
 Western Electric wished to maintain trade secret status on the
 kernel the Lions book was never formally published and was only
 supposed to be distributed to affiliates of source licensees In
 spite of this it soon spread by samizdat to a good many of the
 early UNIX hackers

LISP from LISt Processing language but mythically from
 Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses n The name of AIs
 mother tongue a language based on the ideas of a variablelength
 lists and trees as fundamental data types and b the
 interpretation of code as data and viceversa Invented by John
 McCarthy at MIT in the late 1950s it is actually older than any
 other HLL still in use except FORTRAN Accordingly it has
 undergone considerable adaptive radiation over the years modern
 variants are quite different in detail from the original LISP 15
 The dominant HLL among hackers until the early 1980s LISP now
 shares the throne with C See languages of choice

 All LISP functions and programs are expressions that return
 values this together with the high memory utilization of LISPs
 gave rise to Alan Perliss famous quip itself a take on an Oscar
 Wilde quote that LISP programmers know the value of everything
 and the cost of nothing

 One significant application for LISP has been as a proof by example
 that most newer languages such as COBOL and Ada are full
 of unnecessary crocks When the Right Thing has already
 been done once there is no justification for bogosity in newer
 languages

literature the n Computerscience journals and other
 publications vaguely gestured at to answer a question that the
 speaker believes is trivial Thus one might answer an
 annoying question by saying Its in the literature Oppose
 Knuth which has no connotation of triviality

littleendian adj Describes a computer architecture in which
 within a given 16 or 32bit word bytes at lower addresses have
 lower significance the word is stored littleendfirst The
 PDP11 and VAX families of computers and Intel microprocessors and
 a lot of communications and networking hardware are littleendian
 See bigendian middleendian NUXI problem The term
 is sometimes used to describe the ordering of units other than
 bytes most often these are bits within a byte

live data n 1 Data that is written to be interpreted and takes
 over program flow when triggered by some unobvious operation such
 as viewing it One use of such hacks is to break security For
 example some smart terminals have commands that allow one to
 download strings to program keys this can be used to write live
 data that when listed to the terminal infects it with a
 securitybreaking virus that is triggered the next time a
 hapless user strikes that key For another there are some
 wellknown bugs in vi that allow certain texts to send
 arbitrary commands back to the machine when they are simply viewed
 2 In C code data that includes pointers to function hooks
 executable code 3 An object such as a trampoline that is
 constructed on the fly by a program and intended to be executed as
 code 4 Actual realworld data as opposed to test data
 For example I think I have the record deletion module
 finished Have you tried it out on live data It usually
 carries the connotation that live data is more fragile and must not
 be corrupted else bad things will happen So a possible alternate
 response to the above claim might be Well make sure it works
 perfectly before we throw live data at it The implication here
 is that record deletion is something pretty significant and a
 haywire recorddeletion module running amok on live data would
 cause great harm and probably require restoring from backups

Live Free Or Die imp 1 The state motto of New Hampshire which
 appears on that states automobile license plates 2 A slogan
 associated with UNIX in the romantic days when UNIX aficionados saw
 themselves as a tiny beleaguered underground tilting against the
 windmills of industry The free referred specifically to
 freedom from the fascist design philosophies and crufty
 misfeatures common on commercial operating systems Armando
 Stettner one of the early UNIX developers used to give out fake
 license plates bearing this motto under a large UNIX all in New
 Hampshire colors of green and white These are now valued
 collectors items

livelock livlok n A situation in which some critical stage
 of a task is unable to finish because its clients perpetually
 create more work for it to do after they have been serviced but
 before it can clear its queue Differs from deadlock in that
 the process is not blocked or waiting for anything but has a
 virtually infinite amount of work to do and can never catch up

liveware livweir n 1 Synonym for wetware Less
 common 2 Cambridge Vermin Waiter theres some liveware in
 my salad

lobotomy n 1 What a hacker subjected to formal management
 training is said to have undergone At IBM and elsewhere this term
 is used by both hackers and lowlevel management the latter
 doubtless intend it as a joke 2 The act of removing the
 processor from a microcomputer in order to replace or upgrade it
 Some very cheap clone systems are sold in lobotomized form
  everything but the brain

locked and loaded from military slang for an M16 rifle with
 magazine inserted and prepared for firing adj Said of a removable
 disk volume properly prepared for use  that is locked into the
 drive and with the heads loaded Ironically because their heads
 are loaded whenever the power is up this description is never
 used of Winchester drives which are named after a rifle

locked up adj Syn for hung wedged

logic bomb n Code surreptitiously inserted in an application or
 OS that causes it to perform some destructive or
 securitycompromising activity whenever specified conditions are
 met Compare back door

logical from the technical term logical device wherein a
 physical device is referred to by an arbitrary logical name
 adj Having the role of If a person say Les Earnest at SAIL
 who had long held a certain post left and were replaced the
 replacement would for a while be known as the logical Les
 Earnest This does not imply any judgment on the replacement
 Compare virtual

 At Stanford logical compass directions denote a coordinate
 system in which logical north is toward San Francisco
 logical west is toward the ocean etc even though logical
 north varies between physical true north near San Francisco and
 physical west near San Jose The best rule of thumb here is that
 by definition El Camino Real always runs logical northandsouth
 In giving directions one might say To get to Rincon Tarasco
 restaurant get onto El Camino Bignum going logical north
 Using the word logical helps to prevent the recipient from
 worrying about that the fact that the sun is setting almost
 directly in front of him The concept is reinforced by North
 American highways which are almost but not quite consistently
 labeled with logical rather than physical directions A similar
 situation exists at MIT Route 128 famous for the electronics
 industry that has grown up along it is a 3quarters circle
 surrounding Boston at a radius of 10 miles terminating near the
 coastline at each end It would be most precise to describe the
 two directions along this highway as clockwise and
 counterclockwise but the road signs all say north and
 south respectively A hacker might describe these directions
 as logical north and logical south to indicate that they
 are conventional directions not corresponding to the usual
 denotation for those words If you went logical south along the
 entire length of route 128 you would start out going northwest
 curve around to the south and finish headed due east including
 one infamous stretch of pavement which is simultaneously route 128
 south and Interstate 93 north and is signed as such

loop through vt To process each element of a list of things
 Hold on Ive got to loop through my paper mail Derives from

 be obnoxious or unusually stupid as opposed to ignorant See
 also deserves to lose 4 n Refers to something that is
 losing especially in the phrases Thats a lose and What

lose lose interj A reply to or comment on an undesirable
 situation I accidentally deleted all my files Lose
 lose

loser n An unexpectedly bad situation program programmer or
 person Someone who habitually loses Even winners can lose
 occasionally Someone who knows not and knows not that he knows
 not Emphatic forms are real loser total loser and
 complete loser but not moby loser which would be a
 contradiction in terms See luser

losing adj Said of anything that is or causes a lose or
 lossage

loss n Something not a person that loses a situation in which
 something is losing Emphatic forms include moby loss and
 total loss complete loss Common interjections are
 What a loss and What a moby loss Note that moby loss
 is OK even though moby loser is not used applied to an abstract
 noun moby is simply a magnifier whereas when applied to a person
 it implies substance and has positive connotations Compare
 lossage

lossage losj n The result of a bug or malfunction This
 is a mass or collective noun What a loss and What
 lossage are nearly synonymous The former is slightly more
 particular to the speakers present circumstances the latter
 implies a continuing lose of which the speaker is currently a
 victim Thus for example a temporary hardware failure is a loss
 but bugs in an important tool like a compiler are serious
 lossage

lost in the noise adj Syn lost in the underflow This term
 is from signal processing where signals of very small amplitude
 cannot be separated from lowintensity noise in the system Though
 popular among hackers it is not confined to hackerdom physicists
 engineers astronomers and statisticians all use it

lost in the underflow adj Too small to be worth considering
 more specifically small beyond the limits of accuracy or
 measurement This is a reference to floating underflow a
 condition that can occur when a floatingpoint arithmetic processor
 tries to handle quantities smaller than its limit of magnitude It
 is also a pun on undertow a kind of fast cold current that
 sometimes runs just offshore and can be dangerous to swimmers
 Well sure photon pressure from the stadium lights alters the
 path of a thrown baseball but that effect gets lost in the
 underflow See also overflow bit

lots of MIPS but no IO adj Used to describe a person who is
 technically brilliant but cant seem to communicate with human
 beings effectively Technically it describes a machine that has
 lots of processing power but is bottlenecked on inputoutput in
 1991 the IBM Rios aka RS6000 is a notorious recent
 example

 release 1 versions of software

lurker n One of the silent majority in a electronic forum
 one who posts occasionally or not at all but is known to read the
 groups postings regularly This term is not pejorative and indeed
 is casually used reflexively Oh Im just lurking Often used
 in the lurkers the hypothetical audience for the groups
 flamageemitting regulars

luser loozr n A user esp one who is also a
 loser luser and loser are pronounced
 identically This word was coined around 1975 at MIT Under
 ITS when you first walked up to a terminal at MIT and typed
 ControlZ to get the computers attention it printed out some
 status information including how many people were already using
 the computer it might print 14 users for example Someone
 thought it would be a great joke to patch the system to print
 14 losers instead There ensued a great controversy as some
 of the users didnt particularly want to be called losers to their
 faces every time they used the computer For a while several
 hackers struggled covertly each changing the message behind the
 back of the others any time you logged into the computer it was
 even money whether it would say users or losers Finally
 someone tried the compromise lusers and it stuck Later one
 of the ITS machines supported luser as a requestforhelp
 command ITS died the death in mid1990 except as a museum piece
 the usage lives on however and the term luser is often seen
 in program comments

macro makroh techspeak n A name possibly followed by a
 formal arg list that is equated to a text or symbolic
 expression to which it is to be expanded possibly with the
 substitution of actual arguments by a macro expander This
 definition can be found in any technical dictionary what those
 wont tell you is how the hackish connotations of the term have
 changed over time

 The term macro originated in early assemblers which encouraged
 the use of macros as a structuring and informationhiding device
 During the early 1970s macro assemblers became ubiquitous and
 sometimes quite as powerful and expensive as HLLs only to fall
 from favor as improving compiler technology marginalized assembler
 programming see languages of choice Nowadays the term is
 most often used in connection with the C preprocessor LISP or one
 of several specialpurpose languages built around a macroexpansion
 facility such as TeX or UNIXs ntroff suite

 Indeed the meaning has drifted enough that the collective
 macros is now sometimes used for code in any specialpurpose
 application control language whether or not the language is
 actually translated by text expansion and for macrolike entities
 such as the keyboard macros supported in some text editors
 and PC TSR or Macintosh INITCDEV keyboard enhancers

macro pref Large Opposite of micro In the mainstream
 and among other technical cultures for example medical people
 this competes with the prefix mega but hackers tend to
 restrict the latter to quantification

macrology makroljee n 1 Set of usually complex or crufty
 macros eg as part of a large system written in LISP
 TECO or less commonly assembler 2 The art and science
 involved in comprehending a macrology in sense 1 Sometimes
 studying the macrology of a system is not unlike archeology
 ecology or theology hence the soundalike construction See
 also boxology

macrotape makrohtayp n An industrystandard reel of tape as
 opposed to a microtape

maggotbox magtboks n See Macintrash This is even
 more derogatory

magic adj 1 As yet unexplained or too complicated to explain
 compare automagically and Arthur C Clarkes Third Law
 Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
 magic TTY echoing is controlled by a large number of magic
 bits This routine magically computes the parity of an 8bit
 byte in three instructions 2 Characteristic of something that
 works although no one really understands why this is especially
 called black magic 3 Stanford A feature not generally
 publicized that allows something otherwise impossible or a feature
 formerly in that category but now unveiled Compare black
 magic wizardly deep magic heavy wizardry

 For more about hackish magic see A Story About Magic
 in appendix A

magic cookie UNIX n 1 Something passed between routines or
 programs that enables the receiver to perform some operation a
 capability ticket or opaque identifier Especially used of small
 data objects that contain data encoded in a strange or
 intrinsically machinedependent way Eg on nonUNIX OSes with a
 nonbytestream model of files the result of ftell3 may
 be a magic cookie rather than a byte offset it can be passed to
 fseek3 but not operated on in any meaningful way The
 phrase it hands you a magic cookie means it returns a result
 whose contents are not defined but which can be passed back to the
 same or some other program later 2 An inband code for
 changing graphic rendition eg inverse video or underlining or
 performing other control functions Some older terminals would
 leave a blank on the screen corresponding to modechange magic
 cookies this was also called a glitch See also cookie

magic number UNIXC n 1 In source code some nonobvious
 constant whose value is significant to the operation of a program
 and that is inserted inconspicuously inline hardcoded
 rather than expanded in by a symbol set by a commented
 define Magic numbers in this sense are bad style 2 A
 number that encodes critical information used in an algorithm in
 some opaque way The classic examples of these are the numbers
 used in hash or CRC functions or the coefficients in a linear
 congruential generator for pseudorandom numbers This sense
 actually predates and was ancestral to the more common sense 1
 3 Special data located at the beginning of a binary data file to
 indicate its type to a utility Under UNIX the system and various
 applications programs especially the linker distinguish between
 types of executable file by looking for a magic number Once upon
 a time these magic numbers were PDP11 branch instructions that
 skipped over header data to the start of executable code the 0407
 for example was octal for branch 16 bytes relative Nowadays
 only a wizard knows the spells to create magic numbers How do
 you choose a fresh magic number of your own Simple  you pick
 one at random See Its magic

magic smoke n A substance trapped inside IC packages that enables
 them to function also called blue smoke this is similar to
 the archaic phlogiston hypothesis about combustion Its
 existence is demonstrated by what happens when a chip burns up 
 the magic smoke gets let out so it doesnt work any more See
 smoke test let the smoke out

 USENETter Jay Maynard tells the following story Once while
 hacking on a dedicated Z80 system I was testing code by blowing
 EPROMs and plugging them in the system then seeing what happened
 One time I plugged one in backwards I only discovered that
 after I realized that Intel didnt put poweron lights under
 the quartz windows on the tops of their EPROMs  the die was
 glowing whitehot Amazingly the EPROM worked fine after I erased
 it filled it full of zeros then erased it again For all I know
 its still in service Of course this is because the magic smoke
 didnt get let out Compare the original phrasing of Murphys
 Law

mailing list n often shortened in context to list 1 An
 email address that is an alias or macro though that word
 is never used in this connection for many other email addresses
 Some mailing lists are simple reflectors redirecting mail sent
 to them to the list of recipients Others are filtered by humans
 or programs of varying degrees of sophistication lists filtered by
 humans are said to be moderated 2 The people who receive
 your email when you send it to such an address

 Mailing lists are one of the primary forms of hacker interaction
 along with USENET They predate USENET having originated
 with the first UUCP and ARPANET connections They are often used
 for private informationsharing on topics that would be too
 specialized for or inappropriate to public USENET groups Though
 some of these maintain purely technical content such as the
 Internet Engineering Task Force mailing list others like the
 sflovers list maintained for many years by Saul Jaffe are
 recreational and others are purely social Perhaps the most
 infamous of the social lists was the eccentric bandykin
 distribution its latterday progeny lectroids and
 tanstaafl still include a number of the oddest and most
 interesting people in hackerdom

 Mailing lists are easy to create and unlike USENET dont tie up a
 significant amount of machine resources until they get very large
 at which point they can become interesting torture tests for mail
 software Thus they are often created temporarily by working
 groups the members of which can then collaborate on a project
 without ever needing to meet facetoface Much of the material in
 this lexicon was criticized and polished on just such a mailing
 list called jargonfriends which included all the coauthors
 of Steele1983

main loop n Software tools are often written to perform some
 actions repeatedly on whatever input is handed to them terminating
 when there is no more input or they are explicitly told to go away
 In such programs the loop that gets and processes input is called
 the main loop See also driver

mainframe n Term originally referring to the cabinet
 containing the central processor unit or main frame of a
 roomfilling Stone Age batch machine After the emergence of
 smaller minicomputer designs in the early 1970s the
 traditional big iron machines were described as mainframe
 computers and eventually just as mainframes The term carries the
 connotation of a machine designed for batch rather than interactive
 use though possibly with an interactive timesharing operating
 system retrofitted onto it it is especially used of machines built
 by IBM Unisys and the other great dinosaurs surviving from
 computings Stone Age

 It is common wisdom among hackers that the mainframe architectural
 tradition is essentially dead outside of the tiny market for
 numbercrunching supercomputers see cray having been
 swamped by the recent huge advances in IC technology and lowcost
 personal computing As of 1991 corporate America hasnt quite
 figured this out yet though the wave of failures takeovers and
 mergers among traditional mainframe makers are certainly straws in
 the wind see dinosaurs mating

management n 1 Corporate power elites distinguished primarily by
 their distance from actual productive work and their chronic
 failure to manage see also suit Spoken derisively as in

manularity prob fr techspeak granularity  manual
 n A notional measure of the manual labor required for some task
 particularly one of the sort that automation is supposed to
 eliminate Composing English on paper has much higher manularity
 than using a text editor especially in the revising stage
 Hackers tend to consider manularity a symptom of primitive methods
 in fact a true hacker confronted with an apparent requirement to
 do a computing task by hand will usually consider it
 motivation enough to build another tool

marbles from mainstream lost all hisher marbles pln The
 minimum needed to build your way further up some hierarchy of tools

Mars n A legendary tragic failure the archetypal Hacker Dream
 Gone Wrong Mars was the code name for a family of PDP10
 compatible computers built by Systems Concepts now The SC Group
 the multiprocessor SC30M the small uniprocessor SC25M and the
 neverbuilt superprocessor SC40M These machines were marvels of
 engineering design although not much slower than the unique
 Foonly F1 they were physically smaller and consumed less
 power than the much slower DEC KS10 or Foonly F2 F3 or F4
 machines They were also completely compatible with the DEC KL10
 and ran all KL10 binaries including the operating system with no
 modifications at about 23 times faster than a KL10

 When DEC cancelled the Jupiter project in 1983 Systems Concepts
 should have made a bundle selling their machine into shops with a
 lot of software investment in PDP10s and in fact their spring
 1984 announcement generated a great deal of excitement in the
 PDP10 world TOPS10 was running on the Mars by the summer of
 1984 and TOPS20 by early fall Unfortunately the hackers
 running Systems Concepts were much better at designing machines
 than at mass producing or selling them the company allowed itself
 to be sidetracked by a bout of perfectionism into continually
 improving the design and lost credibility as delivery dates
 continued to slip They also overpriced the product ridiculously
 they believed they were competing with the KL10 and VAX 8600 and
 failed to reckon with the likes of Sun Microsystems and other
 hungry startups building workstations with power comparable to the
 KL10 at a fraction of the price By the time SC shipped the first
 SC30M to Stanford in late 1985 most customers had already made
 the traumatic decision to abandon the PDP10 usually for VMS or
 UNIX boxes Most of the Mars computers built ended up being
 purchased by CompuServe

 epidemiological vector of the hacker subculture meme complex
 each entry might be considered a meme However meme is often
 misused to mean meme complex Use of the term connotes
 acceptance of the idea that in humans and presumably other tool
 and languageusing sophonts cultural evolution by selection of
 adaptive ideas has superseded biological evolution by selection of
 hereditary traits Hackers find this idea congenial for tolerably
 obvious reasons

meme plague n The spread of a successful but pernicious
 meme esp one that parasitizes the victims into giving
 their all to propagate it Astrology BASIC and the other guys
 religion are often considered to be examples This usage is given
 point by the historical fact that joiner ideologies like
 Naziism or various forms of millennarian Christianity have
 exhibited plaguelike cycles of exponential growth followed by
 collapses to small reservoir populations

memetics memetiks from meme The study of memes As of
 mid1991 this is still an extremely informal and speculative
 endeavor though the first steps towards at least statistical rigor
 have been made by H Keith Henson and others Memetics is a
 popular topic for speculation among hackers who like to see
 themselves as the architects of the new information ecologies in
 which memes live and replicate

memory leak n An error in a programs dynamicstore allocation
 logic that causes it to fail to reclaim discarded memory leading
 to eventual collapse due to memory exhaustion Also esp at
 CMU called core leak These problems were severe on older
 machines with small fixedsize address spaces and special leak
 detection tools were commonly written to root them out With the
 advent of virtual memory it is unfortunately easier to be sloppy
 about wasting a bit of memory although when you run out of memory
 on a VM machine it means youve got a real leak See
 aliasing bug fandango on core smash the stack
 precedence lossage overrun screw leaky heap
 leak

memory smash XEROX PARC n Writing through a pointer that
 doesnt point to what you think it does This occasionally reduces
 your machine to a rubble of bits Note that this is subtly
 different from and more general than related terms such as a
 memory leak or fandango on core because it doesnt imply
 an allocation error or overrun condition

menuitis menyooitis n Notional disease suffered by software
 with an obsessively simpleminded menu interface and no escape
 Hackers find this intensely irritating and much prefer the
 flexibility of commandline or languagestyle interfaces
 especially those customizable via macros or a specialpurpose
 language in which one can encode useful hacks See
 userobsequious droolproof paper WIMP environment
 for the rest of us

messdos mesdos n Derisory term for MSDOS Often followed
 by the ritual banishing Just say No See MSDOS Most
 hackers even many MSDOS hackers loathe MSDOS for its
 singletasking nature its limits on application size its nasty
 primitive interface and its ties to IBMness see fear and
 loathing Also messloss messydos messdog
 messdross mushdos and various combinations thereof In
 Ireland and the UK it is even sometimes called Domestos after a
 brand of toilet cleanser

meta met or mayt or Commonwealth meet from
 analytic philosophy adjpref One level of description up A
 metasyntactic variable is a variable in notation used to describe
 syntax and metalanguage is language used to describe language
 This is difficult to explain briefly but much hacker humor turns
 on deliberate confusion between metalevels See Humor
 Hacker

meta bit n The top bit of an 8bit character which is on in
 character values 128255 Also called high bit alt bit
 or hobbit Some terminals and consoles see spacecadet
 keyboard have a META shift key Others including
 mirabile dictu keyboards on IBM PCclass machines have an
 ALT key See also bucky bits

 Historical note although in modern usage shaped by a universe of
 8bit bytes the meta bit is invariably hex 80 octal 0200 things
 were different on earlier machines with 36bit words and 9bit
 bytes The MIT and Stanford keyboards see spacecadet
 keyboard generated hex 100 octal 400 from their meta keys

metasyntactic variable n A name used in examples and understood
 to stand for whatever thing is under discussion or any random
 member of a class of things under discussion The word foo is
 the canonical example To avoid confusion hackers never
 well hardly ever use foo or other words like it as permanent
 names for anything In filenames a common convention is that any
 filename beginning with a metasyntacticvariable name is a
 scratch file that may be deleted at any time

 To some extent the list of ones preferred metasyntactic variables
 is a cultural signature They occur both in series used for
 related groups of variables or objects and as singletons Here
 are a few common signatures

 foo bar baz quux quuux quuuux
 MITStanford usage now found everywhere thanks largely to early
 versions of this lexicon At MIT baz dropped out of use for
 a while in the 1970s and 80s A common recent mutation of this
 sequence inserts qux before quux
 foo bar thud grunt
 This series was popular at CMU Other CMUassociated variables
 include gorp
 foo bar fum
 This series is reported common at XEROX PARC
 fred barney
 See the entry for fred These tend to be Britishisms
 toto titi tata tutu
 Standard series of metasyntactic variables among francophones
 corge grault flarp
 Popular at Rutgers University and among GOSMACS hackers
 zxc spqr wombat
 Cambridge University England

 Of all these only foo and bar are universal and baz
 nearly so The compounds foobar and foobaz also enjoy
 very wide currency

 Some jargon terms are also used as metasyntactic names barf
 and mumble for example See also Commonwealth Hackish
 for discussion of numerous metasyntactic variables found in Great
 Britain and the Commonwealth

MFTL MFTL abbreviation My Favorite Toy Language 1 adj
 Describes a talk on a programming language design that is heavy on
 the syntax with lots of BNF sometimes even talks about semantics
 eg type systems but rarely if ever has any content see
 contentfree More broadly applied to talks  even when
 the topic is not a programming language  in which the subject
 matter is gone into in unnecessary and meticulous detail at the
 sacrifice of any conceptual content Well it was a typical MFTL
 talk 2 n Describes a language about which the developers are
 passionate often to the point of prosyletic zeal but no one else
 cares about Applied to the language by those outside the
 originating group He cornered me about type resolution in his
 MFTL

 The first great goal in the mind of the designer of an MFTL is
 usually to write a compiler for it then bootstrap the design away
 from contamination by lesser languages by writing a compiler for it
 in itself Thus the standard putdown question at an MFTL talk is
 Has it been used for anything besides its own compiler On
 the other hand a language that cannot be used to write
 its own compiler is beneath contempt See breakeven point

 On a related note Dennis Ritchie has proposed a test of the
 generality and utility of a language and the operating system under
 which it is compiled Is the output of a program compiled under
 the language acceptable as input to the compiler In other
 words can you write programs which write programs see
 toolsmith Alarming numbers of language OS pairs fail this
 test particularly when the language is Fortran Ritchie is quick
 to point out that UNIX even using Fortran passes it handily
 That the test could ever be failed is only surprising to those who
 have had the good fortune only to have worked under modern systems
 which lack OSsupported and imposed file types

mickey n The resolution unit of mouse movement It has been
 suggested that the disney will become a benchmark unit for
 animation graphics performance

mickey mouse program n North American equivalent of a noddy
 that is trivial program Doesnt necessarily have the
 belittling connotations of mainstream slang Oh thats just
 mickey mouse stuff sometimes trivial programs can be very
 useful

micro pref 1 Very small this is the root of its use as a
 quantifier prefix 2 A quantifier prefix calling for
 multiplication by 106 see quantifiers Neither
 of these uses is peculiar to hackers but hackers tend to fling
 them both around rather more freely than is countenanced in
 standard English It is recorded for example that one
 CS professor used to characterize the standard length of his
 lectures as a microcentury  that is about 526 minutes see
 also attoparsec nanoacre and especially
 microfortnight 3 Personal or humanscale  that is
 capable of being maintained or comprehended or manipulated by one
 human being This sense is generalized from microcomputer
 and is esp used in contrast with macro the corresponding
 Greek prefix meaning large 4 Local as opposed to global or
 macro Thus a hacker might say that buying a smaller car to
 reduce pollution only solves a microproblem the macroproblem of
 getting to work might be better solved by using mass transit
 moving to within walking distance or best of all telecommuting


microfloppies n 35inch floppies as opposed to 525inch
 vanilla or minifloppies and the nowobsolete 8inch variety
 This term may be headed for obsolescence as 525inchers pass out
 of use only to be revived if anybody floats a sub3inch floppy
 standard See stiffy minifloppies

microfortnight n 11000000 of the fundamental unit of time in
 the FurlongFirkinFortnight system of measurement 12096 sec
 The VMS operating system has a lot of tuning parameters that you
 can set with the SYSGEN utility and one of these is
 TIMEPROMPTWAIT the time the system will wait for an operator to
 set the correct date and time at boot if it realizes that the
 current value is bogus This time is specified in microfortnights

 Multiple uses of the millifortnight about 20 minutes and
 nanofortnight have also been reported

microLenat mikrohlent n See bogosity

microReid mikrohreed n See bogosity

Microsloth Windows mikrohsloth windohz n Hackerism for
 Microsoft Windows a windowing system for the IBMPC which is so
 limited by bugforbug compatibility with messdos that it is
 agonizingly slow on anything less than a fast 386 Compare X
 sunstools

microtape mikrohtayp n Occasionally used to mean a
 DECtape as opposed to a macrotape A DECtape is a small
 reel about 4 inches in diameter of magnetic tape about an inch
 wide Unlike drivers for todays macrotapes microtape
 drivers allow random access to the data and therefore could be
 used to support file systems and even for swapping this was
 generally done purely for hack value as they were far too
 slow for practical use In their heyday they were used in pretty
 much the same ways one would now use a floppy disk as a small
 portable way to save and transport files and programs Apparently
 the term microtape was actually the official term used within
 DEC for these tapes until someone coined the word DECtape
 which of course sounded sexier to the marketroids another
 version of the story holds that someone discovered a conflict with
 another companys microtape trademark

middleendian adj Not bigendian or littleendian
 Used of perverse byte orders such as 3412 or 2143
 occasionally found in the packeddecimal formats of minicomputer
 manufacturers who shall remain nameless See NUXI problem

milliLampson millampsn n A unit of talking speed
 abbreviated mL Most people run about 200 milliLampsons Butler
 Lampson a CS theorist and systems implementor highly regarded
 among hackers goes at 1000 A few people speak faster This unit
 is sometimes used to compare the sometimes widely disparate rates
 at which people can generate ideas and actually emit them in
 speech For example noted computer architect C Gordon Bell
 designer of the PDP11 is said with some awe to think at about
 1200 mL but only talk at about 300 he is frequently reduced to
 fragments of sentences as his mouth tries to keep up with his
 speeding brain

minifloppies n 525inch vanilla floppy disks as opposed to
 35inch or microfloppies and the nowobsolescent 8inch
 variety At one time this term was a trademark of Shugart
 Associates for their SA400 minifloppy drive Nobody paid any
 attention See stiffy

MIPS mips abbreviation n 1 A measure of computing speed
 formally Million Instructions Per Second thats 106
 per second not 220 often rendered by hackers as
 Meaningless Indication of Processor Speed or in other
 unflattering ways This joke expresses a nearly universal attitude
 about the value of most benchmark claims said attitude being
 one of the great cultural divides between hackers and
 marketroids The singular is sometimes 1 MIP even though
 this is clearly etymologically wrong See also KIPS and
 GIPS 2 Computers especially large computers considered
 abstractly as sources of computrons This is just a
 workstation the heavy MIPS are hidden in the basement 3 The
 corporate name of a particular RISCchip company among other
 things they designed the processor chips used in DECs 3100
 workstation series 4 Acronym for Meaningless Information per
 Second a joke prob from sense 1

misbug misbuhg MIT n An unintended property of a program
 that turns out to be useful something that should have been a
 bug but turns out to be a feature Usage rare Compare
 green lightning See miswart

misfeature misfeechr or misfeechr n A feature that
 eventually causes lossage possibly because it is not adequate for
 a new situation which has evolved Since it results from a
 deliberate and properlyimplemented feature a misfeature is not a
 bug Nor is it a simple unforeseen side effect the term implies
 that the feature in question was carefully planned but its
 longterm consequences were not accurately or adequately predicted
 which is quite different from not having thought ahead at all A
 misfeature can be a particularly stubborn problem to resolve
 because fixing it usually involves a substantial philosophical
 change to the structure of the system involved

 Many misfeatures especially in userinterface design arise
 because the designersimplementors mistake their personal tastes
 for laws of nature Often a former feature becomes a misfeature
 because a tradeoff was made whose parameters subsequently change
 possibly only in the judgment of the implementors Well yeah
 it is kind of a misfeature that file names are limited to 6
 characters but the original implementors wanted to save directory
 space and were stuck with it for now

Missedemfive n Pejorative hackerism for ATT System V UNIX
 generally used by BSD partisans in a bigoted mood The
 synonym SysVile is also encountered See software bloat
 Berzerkeley

missile address n See ICBM address

miswart miswort from wart by analogy with misbug n
 A feature that superficially appears to be a wart but has been
 determined to be the Right Thing For example in some versions
 of the EMACS text editor the transpose characters command
 exchanges the character under the cursor with the one before it on the
 screen except when the cursor is at the end of a line in
 which case the two characters before the cursor are exchanged
 While this behavior is perhaps surprising and certainly
 inconsistent it has been found through extensive experimentation
 to be what most users want This feature is a miswart

moby mohbee MIT seems to have been in use among model
 railroad fans years ago Derived from Melvilles Moby Dick
 some say from Moby Pickle 1 adj Large immense complex
 impressive A Saturn V rocket is a truly moby frob Some
 MIT undergrads pulled off a moby hack at the HarvardYale game
 See The Meaning of Hack 2 n obs The
 maximum address space of a machine see below For a 6802340 or
 VAX or most modern 32bit architectures it is 4294967296 8bit
 bytes 4 gigabytes 3 A title of address never of thirdperson
 reference usually used to show admiration respect andor
 friendliness to a competent hacker Greetings moby Dave Hows
 that addressbook thing for the Mac going 4 adj In
 backgammon doubles on the dice as in moby sixes moby
 ones etc Compare this with bignum sense 2 double sixes
 are both bignums and moby sixes but moby ones are not bignums the
 use of moby to describe double ones is sarcastic Standard
 emphatic forms Moby foo moby win moby loss Foby
 moo a spoonerism due to Richard Greenblatt

 This term entered hackerdom with the Fabritek 256K memory added to
 the MIT AI PDP6 machine which was considered unimaginably huge
 when it was installed in the 1960s at a time when a more typical
 memory size for a timesharing system was 72 kilobytes Thus a
 moby is classically 256K 36bit words the size of a PDP6 or
 PDP10 moby Back when address registers were narrow the term was
 more generally useful because when a computer had virtual memory
 mapping it might actually have more physical memory attached to it
 than any one program could access directly One could then say
 This computer has 6 mobies meaning that the ratio of physical
 memory to address space is 6 without having to say specifically
 how much memory there actually is That in turn implied that the
 computer could timeshare six fullsized programs without having
 to swap programs between memory and disk

 Nowadays the low cost of processor logic means that address spaces
 are usually larger than the most physical memory you can cram onto
 a machine so most systems have much less than one theoretical
 native moby of core Also more modern memorymanagement
 techniques esp paging make the moby count less significant
 However there is one series of popular chips for which the term
 could stand to be revived  the Intel 8088 and 80286 with their
 incredibly braindamaged segmentedmemory designs On these a
 moby would be the 1megabyte address span of a segmentoffset
 pair by coincidence a PDP10 moby was exactly 1 megabyte of 9bit
 bytes

mod vtn 1 Short for modify or modification Very
 commonly used  in fact the full terms are considered markers
 that one is being formal The plural mods is used esp with
 reference to bug fixes or minor design changes in hardware or
 software most esp with respect to patch sets or a diff
 2 Short for modulo but used only for its techspeak sense

mode n A general state usually used with an adjective
 describing the state Use of the word mode rather than
 state implies that the state is extended over time and
 probably also that some activity characteristic of that state is
 being carried out No time to hack Im in thesis mode In its
 jargon sense mode is most often attributed to people though
 it is sometimes applied to programs and inanimate objects In
 particular see hack mode day mode night mode
 demo mode fireworks mode and yoyo mode also
 talk mode

 One also often hears the verbs enable and disable used in
 connection with jargon modes Thus for example a sillier way of
 saying Im going to crash is Im going to enable crash mode
 now One might also hear a request to disable flame mode
 please

 In a usage much closer to techspeak a mode is a special state
 which certain user interfaces must pass into in order to perform
 certain functions For example in order to insert characters into a
 document in the UNIX editor vi one must type the i key
 which invokes the Insert command The effect of this command
 is to put vi into insert mode in which typing the i key
 has a quite different effect to wit it inserts an i into the
 document One must then hit another special key ESC in
 order to leave insert mode Nowadays moded interfaces are
 generally considered losing but survive in quite a few
 widelyused tools built in less enlightened times

mode bit n A flag usually in hardware that selects between
 two usually quite different modes of operation The connotations
 are different from flag bit in that mode bits are mainly
 written during a boot or setup phase are seldom explicitly read
 and seldom change over the lifetime of an ordinary program The
 classic example was the EBCDICvsASCII bit 12 of the Program
 Status Word of the IBM 360 Another was the bit on a PDP12 that
 controlled whether it ran the PDP8 or the LINC instruction set

modulo modyuloh prep Except for An overgeneralization of
 mathematical terminology one can consider saying that
 4  22 except for the 9s 4  22 mod 9 Well
 LISP seems to work okay now modulo that GC bug I feel
 fine today modulo a slight headache

mouse ahead vi Pointandclick analog of type ahead To
 manipulate a computers pointing device almost always a mouse in
 this usage but not necessarily and its selection or command

 more usable assuming the users are familiar with the behavior of
 the user interface

mouse around vi To explore public portions of a large system esp
 a network such as Internet via FTP or TELNET looking for
 interesting stuff to snarf

mouse belt n See rat belt

mouse droppings MSDOS n Pixels usually single that are not
 properly restored when the mouse pointer moves away from a
 particular location on the screen producing the appearance that
 the mouse pointer has left droppings behind The major causes for
 this problem are programs that write to the screen memory
 corresponding to the mouse pointers current location without
 hiding the mouse pointer first and mouse drivers that do not quite
 support the graphics mode in use

 clone of CPM for the 8088 crufted together in 6 weeks by
 hacker Tim Paterson who is said to have regretted it ever since
 Numerous features including vaguely UNIXlike but rather broken
 support for subdirectories IO redirection and pipelines were
 hacked into 20 and subsequent versions as a result there are two
 or more incompatible versions of many system calls and MSDOS
 programmers can never agree on basic things like what character to
 use as an option switch or whether to be casesensitive The
 resulting mess is now the highestunitvolume OS in history Often
 known simply as DOS which annoys people familiar with other
 similarly abbreviated operating systems the name goes back to the
 mid1960s when it was attached to IBMs first disk operating
 system for the 360 The name further annoys those who know what
 the term operating system does or ought to connote DOS is
 more properly a set of relatively simple interrupt services Some
 people like to pronounce DOS like dose as in I dont work on
 dose man or to compare it to a dose of braindamaging drugs

mu moo The correct answer to the classic trick question
 Have you stopped beating your wife yet Assuming that you
 have no wife or you have never beaten your wife the answer yes
 is wrong because it implies that you used to beat your wife and
 then stopped but no is worse because it suggests that you have
 one and are still beating her According to various Discordians
 and Douglas Hofstadter see the Bibliography in appendix C
 the correct answer is usually mu a Japanese word alleged to
 mean Your question cannot be answered because it depends on
 incorrect assumptions Hackers tend to be sensitive to logical
 inadequacies in language and many have adopted this suggestion
 with enthusiasm The word mu is actually from Chinese meaning
 nothing it is used in mainstream Japanese in that sense but
 native speakers do not recognize the Discordian questiondenying
 use It almost certainly derives from overgeneralization of the
 answer in the following wellknown Rinzei Zen teaching riddle

MUD muhd acronym MultiUser Dungeon alt MultiUser
 Dimension 1 n A class of virtual reality experiments
 accessible via the Internet These are realtime chat forums with
 structure they have multiple locations like an adventure game
 and may include combat traps puzzles magic a simple economic
 system and the capability for characters to build more structure
 onto the database that represents the existing world 2 vi To
 play a MUD see hackandslay The acronym MUD is often
 lowercased andor verbed thus one may speak of going
 mudding etc

 Historically MUDs and their more recent progeny with names of MU
 form derive from a hack by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw on the
 University of Essexs DEC10 in the early 1980s descendants of
 that game still exist today see BartleMUD There is a
 widespread myth repeated unfortunately by earlier versions of
 this lexicon that the name MUD was trademarked to the commercial
 MUD run by Bartle on British Telecom the motto You havent
 lived til youve died on MUD however this is
 false  Richard Bartle explicitly placed MUD in PD in 1985 BT
 was upset at this as they had already printed trademark claims on
 some maps and posters which were released and created the
 myth

 Students on the European academic networks quickly improved on the
 MUD concept spawning several new MUDs VAXMUD AberMUD LPMUD
 Many of these had associated bulletinboard systems for social
 interaction Because these had an image as research they
 often survived administrative hostility to BBSs in general This
 together with the fact that USENET feeds have been spotty and
 difficult to get in the UK made the MUDs major foci of hackish
 social interaction there

 AberMUD and other variants crossed the Atlantic around 1988 and
 quickly gained popularity in the US they became nuclei for large
 hacker communities with only loose ties to traditional hackerdom
 some observers see parallels with the growth of USENET in the
 early 1980s The second wave of MUDs TinyMUD and variants
 tended to emphasize social interaction puzzles and cooperative
 worldbuilding as opposed to combat and competition In 1991 over
 50 of MUD sites are of a third major variety LPMUD which
 synthesizes the combatpuzzle aspects of AberMUD and older systems
 with the extensibility of TinyMud The trend toward greater
 programmability and flexibility will doubtless continue

 The state of the art in MUD design is still moving very rapidly
 with new simulation designs appearing seemingly every month
 There is now early 1991 a move afoot to deprecate the term
 MUD itself as newer designs exhibit an exploding variety of
 names corresponding to the different simulation styles being
 explored See also BartleMUD berserking bonkoif

 mudhead posing talk mode tinycrud

muddie n Syn mudhead More common in Great Britain possibly
 because system administrators there like to mutter bloody
 muddies when annoyed at the species

mudhead n Commonly used to refer to a MUD player who eats
 sleeps and breathes MUD Mudheads have been known to fail their
 degrees drop out etc with the consolation however that they
 made wizard level When encountered in person on a MUD or in a
 chat system all a mudhead will talk about is three topics the
 tactic character or wizard that is supposedly always unfairly
 stopping himher from becoming a wizard or beating a favorite MUD
 why the specific game heshe has experience with is so much better
 than any other and the MUD he or she is writing or going to write
 because hisher design ideas are so much better than in any
 existing MUD See also wannabee

multician muhltishn coined at Honeywell ca 1970 n
 Competent user of Multics Perhaps oddly no one has ever
 promoted the analogous Unician

Multics muhltiks n from MULTiplexed Information and
 Computing Service An early late 1960s timesharing operating
 system codesigned by a consortium including MIT GE and Bell
 Laboratories Very innovative for its time  among other things
 it introduced the idea of treating all devices uniformly as special
 files All the members but GE eventually pulled out after
 determining that secondsystem effect had bloated Multics to
 the point of practical unusability the lean predecessor in
 question was CTSS Honeywell commercialized Multics after
 buying out GEs computer group but it was never very successful
 among other things on some versions one was commonly required to
 enter a password to log out One of the developers left in the
 lurch by the projects breakup was Ken Thompson a circumstance
 which led directly to the birth of UNIX For this and other
 reasons aspects of the Multics design remain a topic of occasional
 debate among hackers See also braindamaged and GCOS

multitask n Often used of humans in the same meaning it has for
 computers to describe a person doing several things at once but
 see thrash The term multiplex from communications
 technology meaning to handle more than one channel at the same
 time is used similarly

mumblage muhmblj n The topic of ones mumbling see
 mumble All that mumblage is used like all that
 stuff when it is not quite clear how the subject of discussion
 works or like all that crap when mumble is being used as
 an implicit replacement for pejoratives

mumble interj 1 Said when the correct response is too
 complicated to enunciate or the speaker has not thought it out
 Often prefaces a longer answer or indicates a general reluctance
 to get into a long discussion Dont you think that we could
 improve LISP performance by using a hybrid referencecount
 transaction garbage collector if the cache is big enough and there
 are some extra cache bits for the microcode to use Well
 mumble  Ill have to think about it 2 Sometimes used as
 an expression of disagreement I think we should buy a
 VAX Mumble Common variant mumble frotz see
 frotz interestingly one does not say mumble frobnitz
 even though frotz is short for frobnitz 3 Yet another
 metasyntactic variable like foo 4 When used as a question
 Mumble means I didnt understand you 5 Sometimes used
 in public contexts online as a placefiller for things one is
 barred from giving details about For example a poster with
 prereleased hardware in his machine might say Yup my machine
 now has an extra 16M of memory thanks to the card Im testing for
 Mumbleco 6 A conversational wild card used to designate
 something one doesnt want to bother spelling out but which can be
 glarked from context Compare blurgle 7 XEROX PARC

munch often confused with mung qv vt To transform
 information in a serial fashion often requiring large amounts of
 computation To trace down a data structure Related to crunch
 and nearly synonymous with grovel but connotes less pain

munching n Exploration of security holes of someone elses
 computer for thrills notoriety or to annoy the system manager
 Compare cracker See also hacked off

munching squares n A display hack dating back to the PDP1
 ca 1962 reportedly discovered by Jackson Wright which employs
 a trivial computation repeatedly plotting the graph Y  X XOR T
 for successive values of T  see HAKMEM items 146148 to
 produce an impressive display of moving and growing squares that
 devour the screen The initial value of T is treated as a
 parameter which when wellchosen can produce amazing effects
 Some of these later rediscovered on the LISP machine have been
 christened munching triangles try AND for XOR and toggling
 points instead of plotting them munching ws and munching
 mazes More generally suppose a graphics program produces an
 impressive and everchanging display of some basic form foo on a
 display terminal and does it using a relatively simple program
 then the program or the resulting display is likely to be
 referred to as munching foos This is a good example of the
 use of the word foo as a metasyntactic variable

munchkin muhnchkin from the squeakyvoiced little people in
 L Frank Baums The Wizard of Oz n A teenageoryounger micro
 enthusiast hacking BASIC or something else equally constricted A
 term of mild derision  munchkins are annoying but some grow up
 to be hackers after passing through a larval stage The term
 urchin is also used See also wannabee bitty box

mundane from SF fandom n 1 A person who is not in science
 fiction fandom 2 A person who is not in the computer industry
 In this sense most often an adjectival modifier as in in my
 mundane life See also Real World

mung muhng alt munge muhnj in 1960 at MIT Mash
 Until No Good sometime after that the derivation from the
 recursive acronym Mung Until No Good became standard vt
 1 To make changes to a file esp largescale and irrevocable
 changes See BLT 2 To destroy usually accidentally
 occasionally maliciously The system only mungs things
 maliciously this is a consequence of Finagles Law See
 scribble mangle trash nuke Reports from
 USENET suggest that the pronunciation muhnj is now usual
 in speech but the spelling mung is still common in program
 comments compare the widespread confusion over the proper spelling
 of kluge 3 The kind of beans of which the sprouts are used
 in Chinese food Thats their real name Mung beans Really

 Like many early hacker terms this one seems to have originated at
 TMRC it was already in use there in 1958 Peter Samson
 compiler of the TMRC lexicon thinks it may originally have been
 onomatopoeic for the sound of a relay spring contact being
 twanged

Murphys Law prov The correct original Murphys Law
 reads If there are two or more ways to do something and one of
 those ways can result in a catastrophe then someone will do it
 This is a principle of defensive design cited here because it is
 usually given in mutant forms less descriptive of the challenges of
 design for lusers For example you dont make a twopin plug
 symmetrical and then label it THIS WAY UP if it matters which
 way it is plugged in then you make the design asymmetrical see
 also the anecdote under magic smoke

 Edward A Murphy Jr was one of the engineers on the rocketsled
 experiments that were done by the US Air Force in 1949 to test
 human acceleration tolerances USAF project MX981 One experiment
 involved a set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different parts of
 the subjects body There were two ways each sensor could be glued
 to its mount and somebody methodically installed all 16 the wrong
 way around Murphy then made the original form of his
 pronouncement which the test subject Major John Paul Stapp
 quoted at a news conference a few days later

 Within months Murphys Law had spread to various technical
 cultures connected to aerospace engineering Before too many years
 had gone by variants had passed into the popular imagination
 changing as they went Most of these are variants on Anything
 that can go wrong will this is sometimes referred to as
 Finagles Law The memetic drift apparent in these mutants
 clearly demonstrates Murphys Law acting on itself

music n A common extracurricular interest of hackers compare
 sciencefiction fandom oriental food see also
 filk Hackish folklore has long claimed that musical and
 programming abilities are closely related and there has been at
 least one largescale statistical study that supports this
 Hackers as a rule like music and often develop musical
 appreciation in unusual and interesting directions Folk music is
 very big in hacker circles so is electronic music and the sort of
 elaborate instrumental jazzrock that used to be called
 progressive and isnt recorded much any more The hackers
 musical range tends to be wide many can listen with equal
 appreciation to say Talking Heads Yes Gentle Giant Spirogyra
 Scott Joplin Tangerine Dream King Sunny Ade The Pretenders or
 Bachs Brandenburg Concerti It is also apparently true that
 hackerdom includes a much higher concentration of talented amateur
 musicians than one would expect from a similarsized control group
 of mundane types

mutter vt To quietly enter a command not meant for the ears eyes
 or fingers of ordinary mortals Often used in mutter an
 incantation See also wizard

 N 


N N quant 1 A large and indeterminate number of objects
 There were N bugs in that crock Also used in its
 original sense of a variable name This crock has N bugs
 as N goes to infinity The true number of bugs is always
 at least N  1 2 A variable whose value is inherited
 from the current context For example when a meal is being
 ordered at a restaurant N may be understood to mean however
 many people there are at the table From the remark Wed like to
 order N wonton soups and a family dinner
 for N  1 you can deduce that one person at the table
 wants to eat only soup even though you dont know how many people
 there are see greatwall 3 Nth adj The
 ordinal counterpart of N senses 1 and 2 Now for the
 Nth and last time In the specific context
 Nthyear grad student N is generally assumed to
 be at least 4 and is usually 5 or more see tenured graduate
 student See also random numbers twototheN

nadger nadjr Great Britain v Of software or hardware not
 people to twiddle some object in a hidden manner generally so
 that it conforms better to some format For instance string
 printing routines on 8bit processors often take the string text
 from the instruction stream thus a print call looks like jsr
 printHello world The print routine has to nadger the
 return instruction pointer so that the processor doesnt try to
 execute the text as instructions

nailed to the wall like a trophy adj Said of a bug finally
 eliminated after protracted and even heroic effort

nailing jelly vi See like nailing jelly to a tree

naive adj Untutored in the perversities of some particular
 program or system one who still tries to do things in an intuitive
 way rather than the right way in really good designs these
 coincide but most designs arent really good in the
 appropriate sense This is completely unrelated to general
 maturity or competence or even competence at any other specific
 program It is a sad commentary on the primitive state of
 computing that the natural opposite of this term is often claimed
 to be experienced user but is really more like cynical
 user

naive user n A luser Tends to imply someone who is
 ignorant mainly owing to inexperience When this is applied to
 someone who has experience there is a definite implication
 of stupidity

NAK nak from the ASCII mnemonic for 0010101 interj

 109 pref Smaller than micro and used in the same rather
 loose and connotative way Thus one has nanotechnology

nanotechnology nanohteknoljee n A hypothetical
 fabrication technology in which objects are designed and built with
 the individual specification and placement of each separate atom
 The first unequivocal nanofabrication experiments are taking place
 now 1990 for example with the deposition of individual xenon
 atoms on a nickel substrate to spell the logo of a certain very
 large computer company Nanotechnology has been a hot topic in the
 hacker subculture ever since the term was coined by K Eric Drexler
 in his book Engines of Creation where he predicted that
 nanotechnology could give rise to replicating assemblers
 permitting an exponential growth of productivity and personal
 wealth See also blue goo gray goo nanobot

nasal demons n During a discussion on the USENET group
 compstdc in early 1992 a regular remarked When the
 compiler encounters a given undefined construct it is legal for
 it to make demons fly out of your nose the implication is that
 it may choose any arbitrarily bizarre way to interpret the code
 without violating the ANSI C standard Someone else followed up with a
 reference to nasal demons which became recognized shorthand on
 that group for any unexpected behaviour of a C compiler on
 encountering an undefined construct

nastygram nasteegram n 1 A protocol packet or item of
 email the latter is also called a letterbomb that takes
 advantage of misfeatures or security holes on the target system to

neats vs scruffies n The label used to refer to one of the
 continuing holy wars in AI research This conflict tangles
 together two separate issues One is the relationship between
 human reasoning and AI neats tend to try to build systems
 that reason in some way identifiably similar to the way humans
 report themselves as doing while scruffies profess not to
 care whether an algorithm resembles human reasoning in the least as
 long as it works More importantly neats tend to believe
 that logic is king while scruffies favor looser more adhoc
 methods driven by empirical knowledge To a neat
 scruffy methods appear promiscuous and successful only by
 accident to a scruffy neat methods appear to be hung up
 on formalism and irrelevant to the hardtocapture common
 sense of living intelligences

neepneep neep neep onomatopoeic from New York SF fandom n
 One who is fascinated by computers More general than hacker
 as it need not imply more skill than is required to boot games on a
 PC The derived noun neepneeping applies specifically to
 the long conversations about computers that tend to develop in the
 corners at most SFconvention parties Fandom has a related
 proverb to the effect that Hacking is a conversational black
 hole

neophilia neeohfilee n The trait of being excited and
 pleased by novelty Common trait of most hackers SF fans and
 members of several other connected leadingedge subcultures
 including the protechnology Whole Earth wing of the ecology
 movement space activists many members of Mensa and the
 Discordianneopagan underground All these groups overlap heavily
 and where evidence is available seem to share characteristic
 hacker tropisms for science fiction music and oriental

 perhaps during a netburp and doesnt sign back on until
 later In the interim he is dead to the net

nethack nethak UNIX n A dungeon game similar to
 rogue but more elaborate distributed in C source over
 USENET and very popular at UNIX sites and on PCclass machines
 nethack is probably the most widely distributed of the freeware
 dungeon games The earliest versions written by Jay Fenlason and
 later considerably enhanced by Andries Brouwer were simply called
 hack The name changed when maintenance was taken over by a
 group of hackers originally organized by Mike Stephenson the

 means an address on the network see network the this is
 almost always a bang path or Internet address Such an
 address is essential if one wants to be to be taken seriously by
 hackers in particular persons or organizations that claim to
 understand work with sell to or recruit from among hackers but
 dont display net addresses are quietly presumed to be
 clueless poseurs and mentally flushed see flush sense 4
 Hackers often put their net addresses on their business cards and
 wear them prominently in contexts where they expect to meet other
 hackers facetoface see also sciencefiction fandom This
 is mostly functional but is also a signal that one identifies with
 hackerdom like lodge pins among Masons or tiedyed Tshirts among
 Grateful Dead fans Net addresses are often used in email text as
 a more concise substitute for personal names indeed hackers may
 come to know each other quite well by network names without ever
 learning each others legal monikers See also sitename
 domainist

 site is generally considered on the network if it can be reached
 through some combination of Internetstyle sign and UUCP
 bangpath addresses See bang path Internet address
 network address 2 A fictional conspiracy of libertarian
 hackersubversives and antiauthoritarian monkeywrenchers described
 in Robert Anton Wilsons novel Schrodingers Cat to which
 many hackers have subsequently decided they belong this is an
 example of ha ha only serious

 In sense 1 network is often abbreviated to net Are
 you on the net is a frequent question when hackers first meet
 face to face and See you on the net is a frequent goodbye

newbie nyoobee n orig from British publicschool and
 military slang variant of new boy A USENET neophyte
 This term surfaced in the newsgroup talkbizarre but is
 now in wide use Criteria for being considered a newbie vary
 wildly a person can be called a newbie in one newsgroup while
 remaining a respected regular in another The label newbie
 is sometimes applied as a serious insult to a person who has been
 around USENET for a long time but who carefully hides all evidence
 of having a clue See BIFF

newgroup wars nyoogroop wohrz USENET n The salvos of dueling
 newgroup and rmgroup messages sometimes exchanged by
 persons on opposite sides of a dispute over whether a newsgroup
 should be created netwide These usually settle out within a week
 or two as it becomes clear whether the group has a natural
 constituency usually it doesnt At times especially in the
 completely anarchic alt hierarchy the names of newsgroups
 themselves become a form of comment or humor eg the spinoff of
 altswedishchefborkborkbork from alttvmuppets in
 early 1990 or any number of specialized abuse groups named after
 particularly notorious flamers eg altweemba

newline nyoolin n 1 techspeak primarily UNIX The
 ASCII LF character 0001010 used under UNIX as a text line
 terminator A BellLabsism rather than a Berkeleyism
 interestingly and unusually for UNIX jargon it is said to have
 originally been an IBM usage Though the term newline appears
 in ASCII standards it never caught on in the general computing
 world before UNIX 2 More generally any magic character
 character sequence or operation like Pascals writeln procedure
 required to terminate a text record or separate lines See
 crlf terpri

NeWS neewis nyoois or nyooz acronym the
 Network Window System n The road not taken in window systems
 an elegant PostScriptbased environment that would almost certainly
 have won the standards war with X if it hadnt been
 proprietary to Sun Microsystems There is a lesson here that
 too many software vendors havent yet heeded Many hackers insist
 on the twosyllable pronunciations above as a way of distinguishing
 NeWS from news the netnews software

 anyone can post or moderated submissions are automatically
 directed to a moderator who edits or filters and then posts the
 results Some newsgroups have parallel mailing lists for
 Internet people with no netnews access with postings to the group
 automatically propagated to the list and vice versa Some
 moderated groups especially those which are actually gatewayed
 Internet mailing lists are distributed as digests with groups
 of postings periodically collected into a single large posting with
 an index

Nightmare File System n Pejorative hackerism for Suns Network
 File System NFS In any nontrivial network of Suns where there
 is a lot of NFS crossmounting when one Sun goes down the others
 often freeze up Some machine tries to access the down one and
 getting no response repeats indefinitely This causes it to
 appear dead to some messages what is actually happening is that it
 is locked up in what should have been a brief excursion to a higher
 spl level Then another machine tries to reach either the
 down machine or the pseudodown machine and itself becomes
 pseudodown The first machine to discover the down one is now
 trying both to access the down one and to respond to the
 pseudodown one so it is even harder to reach This situation
 snowballs very fast and soon the entire network of machines is
 frozen  worst of all the user cant even abort the file access
 that started the problem Many of NFSes problems are excused by
 partisans as being an inevitable result of its statelessness which
 is held to be a great feature critics of course call it a great
 misfeature ITS partisans are apt to cite this as proof of
 UNIXs alleged bogosity ITS had a working NFSlike shared file
 system with none of these problems in the early 1970s See also
 broadcast storm

NIL nil No Used in reply to a question particularly one
 asked using the P convention Most hackers assume this derives
 simply from LISP terminology for false see also T but
 NIL as a negative reply was wellestablished among radio hams
 decades before the advent of LISP The historical connection
 between early hackerdom and the ham radio word was strong enough
 that this may have been an influence

NMI NMI n NonMaskable Interrupt An IRQ 7 on the PDP11

noddy nodee UK from the childrens books adj
 1 Small and unuseful but demonstrating a point Noddy programs
 are often written by people learning a new language or system The
 archetypal noddy program is hello world Noddy code may be
 used to demonstrate a feature or bug of a compiler May be used of
 real hardware or software to imply that it isnt worth using
 This editors a bit noddy 2 A program that is more or less
 instant to produce In this use the term does not necessarily
 connote uselessness but describes a hack sufficiently trivial
 that it can be written and debugged while carrying on and during
 the space of a normal conversation Ill just throw together a
 noddy awk script to dump all the first fields In North

Nominal Semidestructor n Soundalike slang for National
 Semiconductor found among other places in the 43BSD networking
 sources During the late 1970s to mid1980s this company marketed
 a series of microprocessors including the NS16000 and NS32000 and
 several variants At one point early in the great microprocessor
 race the specs on these chips made them look like serious
 competition for the rising Intel 80x86 and Motorola 680x0 series
 Unfortunately the actual parts were notoriously flaky and never
 implemented the full instruction set promised in their literature
 apparently because the company couldnt get any of the mask
 steppings to work as designed They eventually sank without trace
 joining the Zilog Z80000 and a few even more obscure alsorans in
 the graveyard of forgotten microprocessors Compare HPSUX

nonlinear adj scientific computation 1 Behaving in an erratic
 and unpredictable fashion unstable When used to describe the
 behavior of a machine or program it suggests that said machine or
 program is being forced to run far outside of design
 specifications This behavior may be induced by unreasonable
 inputs or may be triggered when a more mundane bug sends the
 computation far off from its expected course 2 When describing
 the behavior of a person suggests a tantrum or a flame
 When you talk to Bob dont mention the drug problem or hell go
 nonlinear for hours In this context go nonlinear connotes
 blow up out of proportion proportion connotes linearity

nontrivial adj Requiring real thought or significant computing
 power Often used as an understated way of saying that a problem
 is quite difficult or impractical or even entirely unsolvable
 Proving PNP is nontrivial The preferred emphatic form is
 decidedly nontrivial See trivial uninteresting
 interesting

notwork notwerk n A network when it is acting flaky or is
 down Compare nyetwork Said at IBM to have orig
 referred to a particular period of flakiness on IBMs VNET
 corporate network ca 1988 but there are independent reports of
 the term from elsewhere

NP NP pref Extremely Used to modify adjectives
 describing a level or quality of difficulty the connotation is
 often more so than it should be NPcomplete problems all seem
 to be very hard but so far no one has found a good a priori
 reason that they should be Coding a BitBlt implementation to
 perform correctly in every case is NPannoying This is
 generalized from the computerscience terms NPhard and
 NPcomplete NP is the set of NondeterministicPolynomial
 algorithms those that can be completed by a nondeterministic
 Turing machine in an amount of time that is a polynomial function
 of the size of the input a solution for one NPcomplete problem
 would solve all the others Note however that the NP prefix is
 from a complexity theorists point of view the wrong part of
 NPcomplete to connote extreme difficulty it is the completeness
 not the NPness that puts any problem it describes in the
 hard category

nroff enrof UNIX from new runoff n A companion
 program to the UNIX typesetter troff accepting identical
 input but preparing output for terminals and line printers

NSA line eater n The National Security Agency trawling
 program sometimes assumed to be reading USENET for the
 US Governments spooks Most hackers describe it as a mythical
 beast but some believe it actually exists more arent sure and
 many believe in acting as though it exists just in case Some
 netters put loaded phrases like KGB Uzi nuclear materials
 Palestine cocaine and assassination in their sig blocks
 in a probably futile attempt to confuse and overload the
 creature The GNU version of EMACS actually has a command
 that randomly inserts a bunch of insidious anarchoverbiage into

 There is a mainstream variant of this myth involving a Trunk Line
 Monitor which supposedly used speech recognition to extract words
 from telephone trunks This one was making the rounds in the
 late 1970s spread by people who had no idea of thencurrent
 technology or the storage signalprocessing or speech recognition
 needs of such a project On the basis of massstorage costs alone
 it would have been cheaper to hire 50 highschool students and just
 let them listen in Speechrecognition technology cant do this
 job even now 1991 and almost certainly wont in this millennium
 either The peak of silliness came with a letter to an alternative
 paper in New Haven Connecticut laying out the factoids of this
 Big Brotherly affair The letter writer then revealed his actual
 agenda by offering  at an amazing low price just this once we
 take VISA and MasterCard  a scrambler guaranteed to daunt the
 Trunk Trawler and presumably allowing the wouldbe BaaderMeinhof
 gangs of the world to get on with their business

nuke vt 1 To intentionally delete the entire contents of a
 given directory or storage volume On UNIX rm r usr
 will nuke everything in the usr filesystem Never used for
 accidental deletion Oppose blow away 2 Syn for
 dike applied to smaller things such as files features or
 code sections Often used to express a final verdict What do
 you want me to do with that 80meg wallpaper file Nuke
 it 3 Used of processes as well as files nuke is a frequent
 verbal alias for kill 9 on UNIX 4 On IBM PCs a bug
 that results in fandango on core can trash the operating
 system including the FAT the incore copy of the disk block
 chaining information This can utterly scramble attached disks
 which are then said to have been nuked This term is also
 used of analogous lossages on Macintoshes and other micros without
 memory protection

numbercrunching n Computations of a numerical nature esp
 those that make extensive use of floatingpoint numbers The only
 thing Fortrash is good for This term is in widespread
 informal use outside hackerdom and even in mainstream slang but
 has additional hackish connotations namely that the computations
 are mindless and involve massive use of brute force This is
 not always evil esp if it involves ray tracing or fractals
 or some other use that makes pretty pictures esp if such
 pictures can be used as wallpaper See also crunch

numbers scientific computation n Output of a computation that
 may not be significant results but at least indicate that the
 program is running May be used to placate management grant
 sponsors etc Making numbers means running a program
 because output  any output not necessarily meaningful output
  is needed as a demonstration of progress See pretty

 O 


Ob ob pref Obligatory A piece of netiquette
 acknowledging that the author has been straying from the
 newsgroups charter topic For example if a posting in altsex is
 a response to a part of someone elses posting that has nothing
 particularly to do with sex the author may append ObSex or

obiwan error ohbeewon err RPI from offbyone and
 the ObiWan Kenobi character in Star Wars n A loop of
 some sort in which the index is off by 1 Common when the index
 should have started from 0 but instead started from 1 A kind of
 offbyone error See also zeroth

ObjectionableC n Hackish take on ObjectiveC the name of
 an objectoriented dialect of C in competition with the
 betterknown C it is used to write native applications on the
 NeXT machine ObjectionableC uses a Smalltalklike syntax but
 lacks the flexibility of Smalltalk method calls and like many
 such efforts comes frustratingly close to attaining the Right
 Thing without actually doing so

obscure adj Used in an exaggeration of its normal meaning to
 imply total incomprehensibility The reason for that last crash
 is obscure The find1 commands syntax is obscure
 The phrase moderately obscure implies that it could be
 figured out but probably isnt worth the trouble The construction
 obscure in the extreme is the preferred emphatic form

 malfunctions and goes catatonic but doesnt actually crash or
 abort See glitch bug deep space

offbyone error n Exceedingly common error induced in many
 ways such as by starting at 0 when you should have started at 1 or
 vice versa or by writing  N instead of  N or
 viceversa Also applied to giving something to the person next to
 the one who should have gotten it Often confounded with
 fencepost error which is properly a particular subtype of it

 discussion offline Specifically used on USENET to suggest
 that a discussion be taken off a public newsgroup to email

old fart n Tribal elder A title selfassumed with remarkable
 frequency by esp USENETters who have been programming for more
 than about 25 years often appears in sig blocks attached to
 Jargon File contributions of great archeological significance
 This is a term of insult in the second or third person but one of
 pride in first person

 sacred text describing Classic C

onebanana problem n At mainframe shops where the computers
 have operators for routine administrivia the programmers and
 hardware people tend to look down on the operators and claim that a
 trained monkey could do their job It is frequently observed that
 the incentives which would be offered said monkeys can be used
 as a scale to describe the difficulty of a task A onebanana
 problem is simple hence Its only a onebanana job at the most
 whats taking them so long

 At IBM folklore divides the world into one two and
 threebanana problems Other cultures have different hierarchies
 and may divide them more finely at ICL for example five grapes
 a bunch equals a banana Their upper limit for the inhouse
 sysapes is said to be two bananas and three grapes another
 source claims its three bananas and one grape but observes
 However this is subject to local variations cosmic rays and
 ISO At a complication level any higher than that one asks the
 manufacturers to send someone around to check things

oneline fix n Used often sarcastically of a change to a
 program that is thought to be trivial or insignificant right up to
 the moment it crashes the system Usually cured by another
 oneline fix See also I didnt change anything

oneliner wars n A game popular among hackers who code in the
 language APL see writeonly language and line noise
 The objective is to see who can code the most interesting andor
 useful routine in one line of operators chosen from
 APLs exceedingly hairy primitive set A similar amusement
 was practiced among TECO hackers and is now popular among
 Perl aficionados

 Ken Iverson the inventor of APL has been credited with a
 oneliner that given a number N produces a list of the
 prime numbers from 1 to N inclusive It looks like this

 2  0  T o T  T  iN

 where o is the APL null character the assignment arrow is a
 single character and i represents the APL iota

ooblick ooblik from Dr Seusss Bartholomew and the
 Oobleck n A bizarre semiliquid sludge made from cornstarch and
 water Enjoyed among hackers who make batches during playtime at
 parties for its amusing and extremely nonNewtonian behavior it
 pours and splatters but resists rapid motion like a solid and will
 even crack when hit by a hammer Often found near lasers

 Here is a fieldtested ooblick recipe contributed by GLS

 1 cup cornstarch

 1 cup baking soda

 34 cup water

 N drops of food coloring

 This recipe isnt quite as nonNewtonian as a pure cornstarch
 ooblick but has an appropriately slimy feel

 Some however insist that the notion of an ooblick recipe
 is far too mechanical and that it is best to add the water in
 small increments so that the various mixed states the cornstarch
 goes through as it becomes ooblick can be grokked in
 fullness by many hands For optional ingredients of this
 experience see the Ceremonial Chemicals section of
 appendix B

 provides and its general design philosophy exert an extremely
 strong influence on programming style and on the technical cultures
 that grow up around its host machines Hacker folklore has been
 shaped primarily by the UNIX ITS TOPS10

oriental food n Hackers display an intense tropism towards
 oriental cuisine especially Chinese and especially of the spicier
 varieties such as Szechuan and Hunan This phenomenon which has
 also been observed in subcultures that overlap heavily with
 hackerdom most notably sciencefiction fandom has never been
 satisfactorily explained but is sufficiently intense that one can
 assume the target of a hackish dinner expedition to be the best
 local Chinese place and be right at least three times out of four

orphan UNIX n A process whose parent has died one inherited by
 init1 Compare zombie

orphaned inode orfnd inohd UNIX n 1 techspeak A
 file that retains storage but no longer appears in the directories
 of a filesystem 2 By extension a pejorative for any person
 serving no useful function within some organization esp
 lion food without subordinates

orthogonal from mathematics adj Mutually independent well
 separated sometimes irrelevant to Used in a generalization of
 its mathematical meaning to describe sets of primitives or
 capabilities that like a vector basis in geometry span the
 entire capability space of the system and are in some sense
 nonoverlapping or mutually independent For example in
 architectures such as the PDP11 or VAX where all or nearly all
 registers can be used interchangeably in any role with respect to
 any instruction the register set is said to be orthogonal Or in
 logic the set of operators not and or is orthogonal
 but the set nand or and not is not because any
 one of these can be expressed in terms of the others Also used
 in comments on human discourse This may be orthogonal to the
 discussion but

OS OS 1 Operating System n An abbreviation heavily used in email
 occasionally in speech 2 nobs On ITS an output spy See
 OS and JEDGAR in appendix A

OS2 O S too n The anointed successor to MSDOS for Intel
 286 and 386based micros proof that IBMMicrosoft couldnt get it
 right the second time either Mentioning it is usually good for a
 cheap laugh among hackers  the design was so baroque and
 the implementation of 1x so bad that 3 years after introduction
 you could still count the major apps shipping for it on the
 fingers of two hands  in unary Often called HalfanOS On
 January 28 1991 Microsoft announced that it was dropping its OS2
 development to concentrate on Windows leaving the OS entirely in
 the hands of IBM on January 29 they claimed the media had got the
 story wrong but were vague about how It looks as though OS2 is
 moribund See vaporware monstrosity cretinous

outofband from telecommunications and network theory adj
 1 In software describes values of a function which are not in its
 natural range of return values but are rather signals that
 some kind of exception has occurred Many C functions for
 example return either a nonnegative integral value or indicate
 failure with an outofband return value of 1 Compare
 hidden flag green bytes 2 Also sometimes used to
 describe what communications people call shift characters
 like the ESC that leads control sequences for many terminals or
 the level shift indicators in the old 5bit Baudot codes 3 In
 personal communication using methods other than email such as
 telephones or snailmail

overflow bit n 1 techspeak On some processors an attempt to
 calculate a result too large for a register to hold causes a
 particular flag called an overflow bit to be set
 2 Hackers use the term of human thought too Well the Ada
 description was baroque all right but I could hack it OK until
 they got to the exception handling  that set my overflow bit
 3 The hypothetical bit that will be set if a hacker doesnt get to
 make a trip to the Room of Porcelain Fixtures Id better process
 an internal interrupt before the overflow bit gets set

overflow pdl MIT n The place where you put things when your
 pdl is full If you dont have one and too many things get
 pushed you forget something The overflow pdl for a persons
 memory might be a memo pad This usage inspired the following
 doggerel

 Hey diddle diddle
 The overflow pdl
 To get a little more stack
 If thats not enough
 Then you lose it all
 And have to pop all the way back
 The Great Quux

 The term pdl seems to be primarily an MITism outside MIT this
 term would logically be replaced by overflow stack but
 the editors have heard no report of the latter term actually being
 in use

overrun n 1 techspeak Term for a frequent consequence of data
 arriving faster than it can be consumed esp in serial line
 communications For example at 9600 baud there is almost exactly
 one character per millisecond so if your silo can hold only
 two characters and the machine takes longer than 2 msec to get to
 service the interrupt at least one character will be lost
 2 Also applied to nonserialIO communications I forgot to pay
 my electric bill due to mail overrun Sorry I got four phone
 calls in 3 minutes last night and lost your message to overrun
 When thrashing at tasks the next person to make a request
 might be told Overrun Compare firehose syndrome 3 More
 loosely may refer to a buffer overflow not necessarily
 related to processing time as in overrun screw

overrun screw C programming n A variety of fandango on
 core produced by scribbling past the end of an array C
 implementations typically have no checks for this error This is
 relatively benign and easy to spot if the array is static if it is
 auto the result may be to smash the stack  often resulting
 in heisenbugs of the most diabolical subtlety The term
 overrun screw is used esp of scribbles beyond the end of
 arrays allocated with malloc3 this typically trashes the
 allocation header for the next block in the arena producing
 massive lossage within malloc and often a core dump on the next
 operation to use stdio3 or malloc3 itself See
 spam overrun see also memory leak memory
 smash aliasing bug precedence lossage fandango on
 core secondary damage

padded cell n Where you put lusers so they cant hurt
 anything A program that limits a luser to a carefully restricted
 subset of the capabilities of the host system for example the
 rsh1 utility on USG UNIX Note that this is different
 from an iron box because it is overt and not aimed at
 enforcing security so much as protecting others and the luser
 from the consequences of the lusers boundless naivete see

papernet n Hackish way of referring to the postal service
 analogizing it to a very slow lowreliability network USENET
 sig blocks not uncommonly include a PaperNet header just
 before the senders postal address common variants of this are
 Papernet and PNet Compare voicenet snailmail

param pram n Shorthand for parameter See also
 parm compare arg var

PARC n See XEROX PARC

parent message n See followup

parity errors pln Little lapses of attention or in more severe
 cases consciousness usually brought on by having spent all night
 and most of the next day hacking I need to go home and crash
 Im starting to get a lot of parity errors Derives from a
 relatively common but nearly always correctable transient error in
 RAM hardware

Parkinsons Law of Data prov Data expands to fill the space
 available for storage buying more memory encourages the use of
 more memoryintensive techniques It has been observed over the
 last 10 years that the memory usage of evolving systems tends to
 double roughly once every 18 months Fortunately memory density
 available for constant dollars tends to double about once every
 12 months see Moores Law unfortunately the laws of
 physics guarantee that the latter cannot continue indefinitely

parm parm n Furthercompressed form of param This term
 is an IBMism and written use is almost unknown outside IBM
 shops spoken parm is more widely distributed but the synonym
 arg is favored among hackers Compare arg var

parse from linguistic terminology vt 1 To determine the
 syntactic structure of a sentence or other utterance close to the
 standard English meaning That was the one I saw you I
 cant parse that 2 More generally to understand or
 comprehend Its very simple you just kretch the glims and then
 aos the zotz I cant parse that 3 Of fish to have to
 remove the bones yourself I object to parsing fish means I
 dont want to get a whole fish but a sliced one is okay A
 parsed fish has been deboned There is some controversy over
 whether unparsed should mean bony or also mean
 deboned

Pascal n An Algoldescended language designed by Niklaus Wirth
 on the CDC 6600 around 196768 as an instructional tool for
 elementary programming This language designed primarily to keep
 students from shooting themselves in the foot and thus extremely
 restrictive from a generalpurposeprogramming point of view was
 later promoted as a generalpurpose tool and in fact became the
 ancestor of a large family of languages including Modula2 and
 Ada see also bondageanddiscipline language The
 hackish point of view on Pascal was probably best summed up by a
 devastating and in its deadpan way screamingly funny 1981 paper
 by Brian Kernighan of KR fame entitled Why Pascal is
 Not My Favorite Programming Language which was turned down by the
 technical journals but circulated widely via photocopies It was
 eventually published in Comparing and Assessing Programming
 Languages edited by Alan Feuer and Narain Gehani PrenticeHall
 1984 Part of his discussion is worth repeating here because its
 criticisms are still apposite to Pascal itself after ten years of
 improvement and could also stand as an indictment of many other
 bondageanddiscipline languages At the end of a summary of the
 case against Pascal Kernighan wrote

 9 There is no escape

 This last point is perhaps the most important The language is
 inadequate but circumscribed because there is no way to escape its
 limitations There are no casts to disable the typechecking when
 necessary There is no way to replace the defective runtime
 environment with a sensible one unless one controls the compiler
 that defines the standard procedures The language is closed

 People who use Pascal for serious programming fall into a fatal
 trap Because the language is impotent it must be extended But
 each group extends Pascal in its own direction to make it look
 like whatever language they really want Extensions for separate
 compilation FORTRANlike COMMON string data types internal
 static variables initialization octal numbers bit operators
 etc all add to the utility of the language for one group but
 destroy its portability to others

 I feel that it is a mistake to use Pascal for anything much beyond
 its original target In its pure form Pascal is a toy language
 suitable for teaching but not for real programming

 Pascal has since been almost entirely displaced by C from the
 niches it had acquired in serious applications and systems
 programming but retains some popularity as a hobbyist language in
 the MSDOS and Macintosh worlds

pastie paystee n An adhesivebacked label designed to be
 attached to a key on a keyboard to indicate some nonstandard
 character which can be accessed through that key Pasties are
 likely to be used in APL environments where almost every key is
 associated with a special character A pastie on the R key for
 example would remind the user that it is used to generate the rho
 character The term properly refers to nippleconcealing devices
 formerly worn by strippers in concession to indecentexposure
 laws compare tits on a keyboard

patch 1 n A temporary addition to a piece of code usually as a
 quickanddirty remedy to an existing bug or misfeature A
 patch may or may not work and may or may not eventually be
 incorporated permanently into the program Distinguished from a
 diff or mod by the fact that a patch is generated by more
 primitive means than the rest of the program the classical
 examples are instructions modified by using the front panel
 switches and changes made directly to the binary executable of a
 program originally written in an HLL Compare oneline
 fix 2 vt To insert a patch into a piece of code 3 in the
 UNIX world n A diff sense 2 4 A set of modifications to
 binaries to be applied by a patching program IBM operating
 systems often receive updates to the operating system in the form
 of absolute hexadecimal patches If you have modified your OS you
 have to disassemble these back to the source The patches might
 later be corrected by other patches on top of them patches were
 said to grow scar tissue The result was often a convoluted
 patch space and headaches galore 5 UNIX the
 patch1 program written by Larry Wall which automatically
 applies a patch sense 3 to a set of source code

 There is a classic story of a tiger team penetrating a secure
 military computer that illustrates the danger inherent in binary
 patches or indeed any that you cant  or dont  inspect
 and examine before installing They couldnt find any trap
 doors or any way to penetrate security of IBMs OS so they made a
 site visit to an IBM office remember these were official military
 types who were purportedly on official business swiped some IBM
 stationery and created a fake patch The patch was actually the
 trapdoor they needed The patch was distributed at about the right
 time for an IBM patch had official stationery and all accompanying
 documentation and was dutifully installed The installation
 manager very shortly thereafter learned something about proper
 procedures

patch space n An unused block of bits left in a binary so that
 it can later be modified by insertion of machinelanguage
 instructions there typically the patch space is modified to
 contain new code and the superseded code is patched to contain a
 jump or call to the patch space The widening use of HLLs has
 made this term rare it is now primarily historical outside IBM
 shops See patch sense 4 zap sense 4 hook

path n 1 A bang path or explicitly routed Internet
 address a nodebynode specification of a link between two
 machines 2 UNIX A filename fully specified relative to the
 root directory as opposed to relative to the current directory
 the latter is sometimes called a relative path This is also
 called a pathname 3 UNIX and MSDOS The search
 path an environment variable specifying the directories in which
 the shell COMMANDCOM under MSDOS should look for commands
 Other similar constructs abound under UNIX for example the
 C preprocessor has a search path it uses in looking for
 include files

pathological adj 1 scientific computation Used of a data set
 that is grossly atypical of normal expected input esp one that
 exposes a weakness or bug in whatever algorithm one is using An
 algorithm that can be broken by pathological inputs may still be
 useful if such inputs are very unlikely to occur in practice
 2 When used of test input implies that it was purposefully
 engineered as a worst case The implication in both senses is that
 the data is spectacularly illconditioned or that someone had to
 explicitly set out to break the algorithm in order to come up with
 such a crazy example 3 Also said of an unlikely collection of
 circumstances If the network is down and comes up halfway
 through the execution of that command by root the system may
 just crash Yes but thats a pathological case Often used
 to dismiss the case from discussion with the implication that the
 consequences are acceptable since that they will happen so
 infrequently if at all that there is no justification for
 going to extra trouble to handle that case see sense 1

payware payweir n Commercial software Oppose shareware
 or freeware

PBD PBD abbrev of Programmer Brain Damage n Applied
 to bug reports revealing places where the program was obviously
 broken by an incompetent or shortsighted programmer Compare
 UBD see also braindamaged

PCism PCizm n A piece of code or coding technique that
 takes advantage of the unprotected singletasking environment in
 IBM PCs and the like eg by busywaiting on a hardware register
 direct diddling of screen memory or using hard timing loops
 Compare illbehaved vaxism unixism Also
 PCware n a program full of PCisms on a machine with a more
 capable operating system Pejorative

PD PD adj Common abbreviation for public domain applied
 to software distributed over USENET and from Internet archive
 sites Much of this software is not in fact public domain in
 the legal sense but travels under various copyrights granting
 reproduction and use rights to anyone who can snarf a copy See
 copyleft

PDP10 Programmed Data Processor model 10 n The machine that
 made timesharing real It looms large in hacker folklore because
 of its adoption in the mid1970s by many university computing
 facilities and research labs including the MIT AI Lab Stanford
 and CMU Some aspects of the instruction set most notably the
 bitfield instructions are still considered unsurpassed The 10
 was eventually eclipsed by the VAX machines descendants of the
 PDP11 when DEC recognized that the 10 and VAX product lines were
 competing with each other and decided to concentrate its software
 development effort on the more profitable VAX The machine was
 finally dropped from DECs line in 1983 following the failure of
 the Jupiter Project at DEC to build a viable new model Some
 attempts by other companies to market clones came to nothing see
 Foonly This event spelled the doom of ITS and the
 technical cultures that had spawned the original Jargon File but
 by mid1991 it had become something of a badge of honorable
 oldtimerhood among hackers to have cut ones teeth on a PDP10

PDP20 n The most famous computer that never was PDP10
 computers running the TOPS10 operating system were labeled
 DECsystem10 as a way of differentiating them from the PDP11
 Later on those systems running TOPS20 were labeled
 DECSYSTEM20 the block capitals being the result of a lawsuit
 brought against DEC by Singer which once made a computer called
 system10 but contrary to popular lore there was never a
 PDP20 the only difference between a 10 and a 20 was the
 operating system and the color of the paint Most but not all
 machines sold to run TOPS10 were painted Basil Blue whereas
 most TOPS20 machines were painted Chinese Red often mistakenly
 called orange

peek nvt and poke The commands in most microcomputer
 BASICs for directly accessing memory contents at an absolute
 address often extended to mean the corresponding constructs in any
 HLL peek reads memory poke modifies it Much hacking on
 small nonMMU micros consists of peeking around memory more
 or less at random to find the location where the system keeps
 interesting stuff Long and variably accurate lists of such
 addresses for various computers circulate see interrupt list
 the The results of pokes at these addresses may be highly
 useful mildly amusing useless but neat or most likely total
 lossage see killer poke

 Since a real operating system provides useful higherlevel
 services for the tasks commonly performed with peeks and pokes on
 micros and real languages tend not to encourage lowlevel memory
 groveling a question like How do I do a peek in C is
 diagnostic of the newbie Of course OS kernels often have to
 do exactly this a real C hacker would unhesitatingly if
 unportably assign an absolute address to a pointer variable and
 indirect through it

pencil and paper n An archaic information storage and
 transmission device that works by depositing smears of graphite on
 bleached wood pulp More recent developments in paperbased
 technology include improved writeonce update devices which use
 tiny rolling heads similar to mouse balls to deposit colored
 pigment All these devices require an operator skilled at
 socalled handwriting technique These technologies are
 ubiquitous outside hackerdom but nearly forgotten inside it Most
 hackers had terrible handwriting to begin with and years of
 keyboarding tend to have encouraged it to degrade further Perhaps
 for this reason hackers deprecate pencilandpaper technology and
 often resist using it in any but the most trivial contexts See
 also appendix B

peon n A person with no special root or wheel
 privileges on a computer system I cant create an account on
 foovax for you Im only a peon there

percentS persent es From the code in Cs printf3
 library function used to insert an arbitrary string argument n An
 unspecified person or object I was just talking to some
 percents in administration Compare random

perf perf n See chad sense 1 The term perfory
 perfree is also heard The term perf may also refer to
 the preforations themselves rather than the chad they produce when
 torn

perfect programmer syndrome n Arrogance the egotistical
 conviction that one is above normal human error Most frequently
 found among programmers of some native ability but relatively
 little experience especially new graduates their perceptions may
 be distorted by a history of excellent performance at solving toy
 problems Of course my program is correct there is no need to
 test it Yes I can see there may be a problem here but
 Ill never type rm r  while in root

Perl perl Practical Extraction and Report Language aka
 Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister n An interpreted language
 developed by Larry Wall lwalljplnasagov author of
 patch1 and rn1 and distributed over USENET
 Superficially resembles awk1 but is much hairier see
 awk UNIX sysadmins who are almost always incorrigible
 hackers increasingly consider it one of the languages of
 choice Perl has been described in a parody of a famous remark
 about lex1 as the SwissArmy chainsaw of UNIX
 programming

pessimal pesiml Latinbased antonym for optimal adj
 Maximally bad This is a pessimal situation Also pessimize
 vt To make as bad as possible These words are the obvious
 Latinbased antonyms for optimal and optimize but for some
 reason they do not appear in most English dictionaries although
 pessimize is listed in the OED

pessimizing compiler pesmizing kmpilr antonym of
 optimizing compiler n A compiler that produces object code that
 is worse than the straightforward or obvious hand translation The
 implication is that the compiler is actually trying to optimize the
 program but through excessive cleverness is doing the opposite A
 few pessimizing compilers have been written on purpose however as
 pranks or burlesques

peta pet SI pref See quantifiers

PETSCII petskee abbreviation of PET ASCII n The variation
 many would say perversion of the ASCII character set used by
 the Commodore Business Machines PET series of personal computers
 and the later Commodore C64 C16 and C128 machines The PETSCII
 set used leftarrow and uparrow as in oldstyle ASCII instead of
 underscore and caret placed the unshifted alphabet at positions
 6590 put the shifted alphabet at positions 193218 and added
 graphics characters

phase 1 n The phase of ones wakingsleeping schedule with
 respect to the standard 24hour cycle This is a useful concept
 among people who often work at night andor according to no fixed
 schedule It is not uncommon to change ones phase by as much as 6
 hours per day on a regular basis Whats your phase Ive
 been getting in about 8 PM lately but Im going to wrap
 around to the day schedule by Friday A person who is roughly
 12 hours out of phase is sometimes said to be in night mode
 The term day mode is also but less frequently used meaning
 youre working 9 to 5 or more likely 10 to 6 The act of
 altering ones cycle is called changing phase phase
 shifting has also been recently reported from Caltech
 2 change phase the hard way To stay awake for a very long
 time in order to get into a different phase 3 change phase
 the easy way To stay asleep etc However some claim that
 either staying awake longer or sleeping longer is easy and that it
 is shortening your day or night thats hard see wrap
 around The jet lag that afflicts travelers who cross many
 timezone boundaries may be attributed to two distinct causes the
 strain of travel per se and the strain of changing phase Hackers
 who suddenly find that they must change phase drastically in a
 short period of time particularly the hard way experience
 something very like jet lag without traveling

phase of the moon n Used humorously as a random parameter on which
 something is said to depend Sometimes implies unreliability of
 whatever is dependent or that reliability seems to be dependent on
 conditions nobody has been able to determine This feature
 depends on having the channel open in mumble mode having the foo
 switch set and on the phase of the moon

 True story Once upon a time there was a bug that really did depend
 on the phase of the moon There is a little subroutine that had
 traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an
 approximation to the moons true phase GLS incorporated this
 routine into a LISP program that when it wrote out a file would
 print a timestamp line almost 80 characters long Very
 occasionally the first line of the message would be too long and
 would overflow onto the next line and when the file was later read
 back in the program would barf The length of the first line
 depended on both the precise date and time and the length of the
 phase specification when the timestamp was printed and so the bug
 literally depended on the phase of the moon

 The first paper edition of the Jargon File Steele1983 included
 an example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug
 but the typesetter corrected it This has since been
 described as the phaseofthemoonbug bug

phasewrapping MIT n Syn wrap around sense 2

phreaking freeking from phone phreak n 1 The art and
 science of cracking the phone network so as for example to make
 free longdistance calls 2 By extension securitycracking in
 any other context especially but not exclusively on
 communications networks see cracking

 At one time phreaking was a semirespectable activity among
 hackers there was a gentlemans agreement that phreaking as an
 intellectual game and a form of exploration was OK but serious
 theft of services was taboo There was significant crossover
 between the hacker community and the hardcore phone phreaks who
 ran semiunderground networks of their own through such media as
 the legendary TAP Newsletter This ethos began to break
 down in the mid1980s as wider dissemination of the techniques put
 them in the hands of less responsible phreaks Around the same
 time changes in the phone network made oldstyle technical
 ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it so phreaking came
 to depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phonecard
 numbers The crimes and punishments of gangs like the 414 group
 turned that game very ugly A few oldtime hackers still phreak
 casually just to keep their hand in but most these days have
 hardly even heard of blue boxes or any of the other
 paraphernalia of the great phreaks of yore

 sent by a computer to check for the presence and aliveness of
 another Occasionally used as a phone greeting See ACK
 also ENQ 2 vt To verify the presence of 3 vt To get
 the attention of From the UNIX command ping1 that sends
 an ICMP ECHO packet to another host 4 vt To send a message to
 all members of a mailing list requesting an ACK in order
 to verify that everybodys addresses are reachable We havent
 heard much of anything from Geoff but he did respond with an ACK
 both times I pinged jargonfriends 5 n A quantum packet of
 happiness People who are very happy tend to exude pings
 furthermore one can intentionally create pings and aim them at a
 needy party eg a depressed person This sense of ping may
 appear as an exclamation Ping Im happy I am emitting a
 quantum of happiness I have been struck by a quantum of
 happiness The form pingfulness which is used to describe
 people who exude pings also occurs In the standard abuse of
 language pingfulness can also be used as an exclamation in
 which case its a much stronger exclamation than just ping
 Oppose blargh

 The funniest use of ping to date was described in January 1991 by
 Steve Hayman on the USENET group compsysnext He was trying
 to isolate a faulty cable segment on a TCPIP Ethernet hooked up to
 a NeXT machine and got tired of having to run back to his console
 after each cabling tweak to see if the ping packets were getting
 through So he used the soundrecording feature on the NeXT then
 wrote a script that repeatedly invoked ping8 listened for
 an echo and played back the recording on each returned packet
 Result A program that caused the machine to repeat over and
 over Ping  ping  ping  as long as the
 network was up He turned the volume to maximum ferreted through
 the building with one ear cocked and found a faulty tee connector

 copying and in OS8 and RT11 for just about every other file
 operation you might want to do It is said that when the program
 was originated during the development of the PDP6 in 1963 it was
 called ATLATL Anything Lord to Anything Lord this played on
 the Nahuatl word atlatl for a spearthrower with connotations
 of utility and primitivity that were no doubt quite intentional

platinumiridium adj Standard against which all others of the
 same category are measured Usage silly The notion is that one
 of whatever it is has actually been cast in platinumiridium alloy
 and placed in the vault beside the Standard Kilogram at the
 International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris From
 1889 to 1960 the meter was defined to be the distance between two
 scratches in a platinumiridium bar kept in that vault  this
 replaced an earlier definition as 107 times the distance
 between the North Pole and the Equator along a meridian through
 Paris unfortunately this had been based on an inexact value of
 the circumference of the Earth From 1960 to 1984 it was defined
 to be 165076373 wavelengths of the orangered line of krypton86
 propagating in a vacuum It is now defined as the length of the
 path traveled by light in a vacuum in the time interval of
 1299792458 of a second The kilogram is now the only unit of

plokta plokt Acronym for Press Lots Of Keys To Abort
 v To press random keys in an attempt to get some response from
 the system One might plokta when the abort procedure for a
 program is not known or when trying to figure out if the system is
 just sluggish or really hung Plokta can also be used while trying
 to figure out any unknown key sequence for a particular operation
 Someone going into plokta mode usually places both hands flat
 on the keyboard and presses down hoping for some useful
 response

 A slightly more diected form of plokta can often be seen in mail
 messages or USENET articles from new users  the text might end
 with

PostScript n A groundbreaking Page Description Language
 PDL based on work originally done by John Gaffney at Evans
 and Sutherland in 1976 evolving through JaM John and Martin
 Martin Newell at XEROX PARC and finally implemented in its
 current form by John Warnock et al after he and Chuck Geschke
 founded Adobe Systems Incorporated in 1982 PostScript gets its
 leverage by using a full programming language rather than a series
 of lowlevel escape sequences to describe an image to be printed
 on a laser printer or other output device in this it parallels
 EMACS which exploited a similar insight about editing tasks
 It is also noteworthy for implementing onthe fly rasterization
 from Bezier curve descriptions of highquality fonts at low eg
 300 dpi resolution it was formerly believed that handtuned
 bitmap fonts were required for this task Hackers consider
 PostScript to be among the most elegant hacks of all time and the
 combination of technical merits and widespread availability has
 made PostScript the language of choice for graphical output

punched card alt punch card techspeak nobs The signature
 medium of computings Stone Age now obsolescent outside of
 some IBM shops The punched card actually predated computers
 considerably originating in 1801 as a control device for
 mechanical looms The version patented by Hollerith and used with
 mechanical tabulating machines in the 1890 US Census was a piece
 of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm designed to fit exactly in the
 currency trays used for that eras larger dollar bills

 IBM which originated as a tabulatingmachine manufacturer married
 the punched card to computers encoding binary information as
 patterns of small rectangular holes one character per column
 80 columns per card Other coding schemes sizes of card and
 hole shapes were tried at various times

 The 80column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the
 IBM punched card so is the size of the quickreference cards

quantifiers In techspeak and jargon the standard metric
 prefixes used in the SI Systeme International conventions for
 scientific measurement have dual uses With units of time or
 things that come in powers of 10 such as money they retain their
 usual meanings of multiplication by powers of 1000  103
 But when used with bytes or other things that naturally come in
 powers of 2 they usually denote multiplication by powers of
 1024  210

 Here are the SI magnifying prefixes along with the corresponding
 binary interpretations in common use

 prefix decimal binary
 kilo 10001 10241  210  1024
 mega 10002 10242  220  1048576
 giga 10003 10243  230  1073741824

 yotta 10008 10248  280  1208925819614629174706176

 Here are the SI fractional prefixes

 prefix decimal jargon usage
 milli 10001 seldom used in jargon
 micro 10002 small or humanscale see micro
 nano 10003 even smaller see nano
 pico 10004 even smaller yet see pico
 femto 10005 not used in jargonyet
 atto 10006 not used in jargonyet
 zepto 10007 not used in jargonyet
 yocto 10008 not used in jargonyet

 The prefixes zetta yotta zepto and yocto have been included
 in these tables purely for completeness and giggle value they were
 adopted in 1990 by the 19th Conference Generale des Poids et
 Mesures The binary peta and exa loadings though well
 established are not in jargon use either  yet The prefix
 milli denoting multiplication by 10001 has always
 been rare in jargon there is however a standard joke about the
 millihelen  notionally the amount of beauty required to
 launch one ship See the entries on micro pico and
 nano for more information on connotative jargon use of these
 terms Femto and atto which interestingly derive not
 from Greek but from Danish have not yet acquired jargon loadings
 though it is easy to predict what those will be once computing
 technology enters the required realms of magnitude however see
 attoparsec

 There are of course some standard unit prefixes for powers of
 10 In the following table the prefix column is the
 international standard suffix for the appropriate power of ten the
 binary column lists jargon abbreviations and words for the
 corresponding power of 2 The Bsuffixed forms are commonly used
 for byte quantities the words meg and gig are nouns which may
 but do not always pluralize with s

 prefix decimal binary pronunciation
 kilo k K KB kay
 mega M M MB meg meg
 giga G G GB gig gigjig

 Confusingly hackers often use K or M as though they were suffix or
 numeric multipliers rather than a prefix thus 2K dollars 2M
 of disk space This is also true though less commonly of G

 Note that the formal SI metric prefix for 1000 is k some use
 this strictly reserving K for multiplication by 1024 KB is
 kilobytes

 K M and G used alone refer to quantities of bytes thus 64G is
 64 gigabytes and a K is a kilobyte compare mainstream use of
 a G as short for a grand that is 1000 Whether one
 pronounces gig with hard or soft g depends on what one thinks
 the proper pronunciation of giga is

 Confusing 1000 and 1024 or other powers of 2 and 10 close in
 magnitude  for example describing a memory in units of
 500K or 524K instead of 512K  is a sure sign of the
 marketroid

quux kwuhks Mythically from the Latin semideponent verb
 quuxo quuxare quuxandum iri noun form variously quux plural
 quuces anglicized to quuxes and quuxu genitive
 plural is quuxuum for four uletters out of seven in all
 using up all the u letters in Scrabble 1 Originally a
 metasyntactic variable like foo and foobar
 Invented by Guy Steele for precisely this purpose when he was young
 and naive and not yet interacting with the real computing
 community Many people invent such words this one seems simply to
 have been lucky enough to have spread a little In an eloquent
 display of poetic justice it has returned to the originator in the
 form of a nickname 2 interj See foo however denotes very
 little disgust and is uttered mostly for the sake of the sound of
 it 3 Guy Steele in his persona as The Great Quux which is
 somewhat infamous for light verse and for the Crunchly cartoons
 4 In some circles quux is used as a punning opposite of crux
 Ah thats the quux of the matter implies that the point is
 not crucial compare tip of the icecube 5 quuxy
 adj Of or pertaining to a quux

qux kwuhks The fourth of the standard metasyntactic
 variable after baz and before the quuux series
 See foo bar baz quux This appears to be a
 recent mutation from quux and many versions of the
 standard series just run foo bar baz quux
 

QWERTY kwertee from the keycaps at the upper left adj
 Pertaining to a standard Englishlanguage typewriter keyboard
 sometimes called the Sholes keyboard after its inventor as
 opposed to Dvorak or foreignlanguage layouts or a spacecadet
 keyboard or APL keyboard

 Historical note The QWERTY layout is a fine example of a fossil
 It is sometimes said that it was designed to slow down the typist
 but this is wrong it was designed to allow faster typing
  under a constraint now long obsolete In early typewriters
 fast typing using nearby typebars jammed the mechanism So Sholes
 fiddled the layout to separate the letters of many common digraphs
 he did a far from perfect job though th tr ed and er
 for example each use two nearby keys Also putting the letters
 of typewriter on one line allowed it to be typed with particular
 speed and accuracy for demos The jamming problem was
 essentially solved soon afterward by a suitable use of springs but
 the keyboard layout lives on

 inelegance 2 A hack or crock that depends on a complex
 combination of coincidences or possibly the combination upon
 which the crock depends for its accidental failure to malfunction
 This hack can output characters 4057 by putting the character
 in the fourbit accumulator field of an XCT and then extracting
 six bits  the low 2 bits of the XCT opcode are the right
 thing What randomness 3 Of people synonymous with
 flakiness The connotation is that the person so described is
 behaving weirdly incompetently or inappropriately for reasons

 2 To speak authoritatively on a subject about which one knows
 very little 3 To complain to a person who is not in a position
 to correct the difficulty 4 To purposely annoy another person
 verbally 5 To evangelize See flame 6 Also used to
 describe a less negative form of blather such as friendly
 bullshitting Rave differs slightly from flame in that
 rave implies that it is the persistence or obliviousness of the
 person speaking that is annoying while flame implies somewhat
 more strongly that the tone is offensive as well

rave on imp Sarcastic invitation to continue a rave often by
 someone who wishes the raver would get a clue but realizes this is
 unlikely

ravs ravz also Chinese ravs n Jiaozi steamed or
 boiled or Guotie panfried A Chinese appetizer known
 variously in the plural as dumplings pot stickers the literal
 translation of guotie and around Boston Peking Ravioli The
 term rav is short for ravioli which among hackers always
 means the Chinese kind rather than the Italian kind Both consist
 of a filling in a pasta shell but the Chinese kind includes no
 cheese uses a thinner pasta has a porkvegetable filling good
 ones include Chinese chives and is cooked differently either by
 steaming or frying A rav or dumpling can be cooked any way but a
 potsticker is always the fried kind so called because it sticks to
 the frying pot and has to be scraped off Lets get

README file n By convention the toplevel directory of a UNIX
 source distribution always contains a file named README or
 README or rarely ReadMe or some other variant which is a
 hackerseye introduction containing a pointer to more detailed
 documentation credits miscellaneous revision history notes etc
 In the Mac and PC worlds software is not usually distributed in
 source form and a README is more likely to contain useroriented
 material like lastminute documentation changes error workarounds
 and restrictions When asked hackers invariably relate the README
 convention to the famous scene in Lewis Carrolls Alices
 Adventures In Wonderland in which Alice confronts magic munchies
 labeled Eat Me and Drink Me

real programmer indirectly from the book Real Men Dont
 Eat Quiche n A particular subvariety of hacker one possessed
 of a flippant attitude toward complexity that is arrogant even when
 justified by experience The archetypal real programmer likes
 to program on the bare metal and is very good at same
 remembers the binary opcodes for every machine he has ever
 programmed thinks that HLLs are sissy and uses a debugger to edit
 his code because fullscreen editors are for wimps Real
 Programmers arent satisfied with code that hasnt been bummed
 into a state of tenseness just short of rupture Real
 Programmers never use comments or write documentation If it was
 hard to write says the Real Programmer it should be hard to
 understand Real Programmers can make machines do things that
 were never in their spec sheets in fact they are seldom really
 happy unless doing so A Real Programmers code can awe with its
 fiendish brilliance even as its crockishness appalls Real
 Programmers live on junk food and coffee hang lineprinter art on
 their walls and terrify the crap out of other programmers 
 because someday somebody else might have to try to understand
 their code in order to change it Their successors generally
 consider it a Good Thing that there arent many Real
 Programmers around any more For a famous and somewhat more
 positive portrait of a Real Programmer see The Story
 of Mel a Real Programmer in appendix A

real time 1 techspeak adj Describes an application which
 requires a program to respond to stimuli within some small upper

 bizarre dimension in which the standard dress is shirt and tie and
 in which a persons working hours are defined as 9 to 5 see

regexp regeksp UNIX n alt regex or regex
 1 Common written and spoken abbreviation for regular
 expression one of the wildcard patterns used eg by UNIX
 utilities such as grep1 sed1 and awk1
 These use conventions similar to but more elaborate than those
 described under glob For purposes of this lexicon it is
 sufficient to note that regexps also allow complemented character
 sets using  thus one can specify any nonalphabetic
 character with AZaz 2 Name of a wellknown PD
 regexphandling package in portable C written by revered USENETter

register dancing n Many older processor architectures suffer
 from a serious shortage of generalpurpose registers This is
 especially a problem for compilerwriters because their generated
 code needs places to store temporaries for things like intermediate
 values in expression evaluation Some designs with this problem
 like the Intel 80x86 do have a handful of specialpurpose
 registers that can be pressed into service providing suitable care
 is taken to avoid unpleasant sideeffects on the state of the
 processor while the specialpurpose register is being used to hold
 an intermediate value a delicate minuet is required in which the
 previous value of the register is saved and then restored just before
 the official function and value of the specialpurpose register is
 again needed

reincarnation cycle of n See cycle of reincarnation

reinvent the wheel v To design or implement a tool equivalent to
 an existing one or part of one with the implication that doing so
 is silly or a waste of time This is often a valid criticism
 On the other hand automobiles dont use wooden rollers and some
 kinds of wheel have to be reinvented many times before you get them
 right On the third hand people reinventing the wheel do tend to
 come up with the moral equivalent of a trapezoid with an offset
 axle

religious issues n Questions which seemingly cannot be raised
 without touching off holy wars such as What is the best
 operating system or editor language architecture shell mail
 reader news reader What about that Heinlein guy eh
 What should we add to the new Jargon File See holy wars
 see also theology bigot

 This term is an example of ha ha only serious People
 actually develop the most amazing and religiously intense
 attachments to their tools even when the tools are intangible

 crossfire is mumble Get a life and leave  unless of course
 ones own unassailably rational and obviously correct
 choices are being slammed

 itself this could be a living organism an idea see meme a
 program see worm wabbit fork bomb and
 virus a pattern in a cellular automaton see life
 sense 1 or speculatively a robot or nanobot It is even
 claimed by some that UNIX and C are the symbiotic halves
 of an extremely successful replicator see UNIX conspiracy

reset the MUD community v In AberMUD to bring all dead mobiles
 to life and move items back to their initial starting places New
 players who cant find anything shout Reset Reset quite a bit
 Higherlevel players shout back No way since they know where
 points are to be found Used in RL it means to put things back
 to the way they were when you found them

restriction n A bug or design error that limits a programs
 capabilities and which is sufficiently egregious that nobody can
 quite work up enough nerve to describe it as a feature Often
 used esp by marketroid types to make it sound as though
 some crippling bogosity had been intended by the designers all
 along or was forced upon them by arcane technical constraints of a
 nature no mere user could possibly comprehend these claims are
 almost invariably false

 Oldtime hacker Joseph M Newcomer advises that whenever choosing a
 quantifiable but arbitrary restriction you should make it either a
 power of 2 or a power of 2 minus 1 If you impose a limit of
 17 items in a list everyone will know it is a random number  on
 the other hand a limit of 15 or 16 suggests some deep reason
 involving 0 or 1based indexing in binary and you will get less
 flamage for it Limits which are round numbers in base 10 are
 always especially suspect

retcon retkon retroactive continuity from the USENET
 newsgroup recartscomics 1 n The common situation in pulp
 fiction esp comics or soap operas where a new story
 reveals things about events in previous stories usually
 leaving the facts the same thus preserving continuity while
 completely changing their interpretation For example revealing
 that a whole season of Dallas was a dream was a retcon
 2 vt To write such a story about a character or fictitious
 object Byrne has retconned Supermans cape so that it is no
 longer unbreakable Marvelmans old adventures were retconned
 into synthetic dreams Swamp Thing was retconned from a
 transformed person into a sentient vegetable Darth Vader was
 retconned into Luke Skywalkers father in The Empire Strikes
 Back

 This is included because it is a good example of hackish
 linguistic innovation in a field completely unrelated to computers
 The word retcon will probably spread through comics fandom and
 lose its association with hackerdom within a couple of years for
 the record it started here  ESR

RETI v Syn RTI

retrocomputing retrohkmpyooting n Refers to emulations
 of waybehindthestateoftheart hardware or software or
 implementations of neverwasstateoftheart esp if such
 implementations are elaborate practical jokes andor parodies
 written mostly for hack value of more serious designs
 Perhaps the most widely distributed retrocomputing utility was the
 pnch6 or bcd6 program on V7 and other early UNIX
 versions which would accept up to 80 characters of text argument
 and display the corresponding pattern in punched card code
 Other wellknown retrocomputing hacks have included the programming
 language INTERCAL a JCLemulating shell for UNIX the
 cardpunchemulating editor named 029 and various elaborate PDP11
 hardware emulators and RT11 OS emulators written just to keep an
 old sourceless Zork binary running

RFC RFC Request For Comment n One of a longestablished
 series of numbered Internet standards widely followed by commercial
 and PD software in the Internet and UNIX communities Perhaps the
 single most influential one has been RFC822 the Internet
 mailformat standard The RFCs are unusual in that they are
 floated by technical experts acting on their own initiative and
 reviewed by the Internet at large rather than formally promulgated
 through an institution such as ANSI For this reason they remain
 known as RFCs even once adopted

 The RFC tradition of pragmatic experiencedriven afterthefact
 standardwriting done by individuals or small working groups has
 important advantages over the more formal committeedriven process
 typical of ANSI or ISO Emblematic of some of these is the
 existence of a flourishing tradition of joke RFCs usually at
 least one a year is published usually on April 1st Wellknown
 joke RFCs have included 527 ARPAWOCKY R Merryman UCSD 22
 June 1973 748 Telnet RandomlyLose Option Mark R Crispin
 1 April 1978 and 1149 A Standard for the Transmission of IP
 Datagrams on Avian Carriers D Waitzman BBN STC 1 April 1990
 The first was a Lewis Carrol pastiche the second a parody of the
 TCPIP documentation style and the third a deadpan skewering of
 standardsdocument legalese describing protocols for transmiitting
 Internet data packets by carrier pigeon

 The RFCs are most remarkable for how well they work  they manage to
 have neither the ambiguities which are usually rife in informal
 specifications nor the committeeperpetrated misfeatures which often
 haunt formal standards and they define a network which has grown to
 truly worldwide proportions

 service Examples are NickServ which tries to prevent random
 users from adopting nicks already claimed by others and
 MsgServ which allows one to send asynchronous messages to be
 delivered when the recipient signs on Also common are
 annoybots such as KissServ which perform no useful function
 except to send cute messages to other people Service robots are
 less common on MUDs but some others such as the Julia robot
 active in 199091 have been remarkably impressive Turingtest
 experiments able to pass as human for as long as ten or fifteen
 minutes of conversation

 recover gracefully from the whole range of exceptional inputs and
 situations in a given environment One step below bulletproof
 Carries the additional connotation of elegance in addition to just
 careful attention to detail Compare smart oppose

rococo adj Baroque in the extreme Used to imply that a
 program has become so encrusted with the software equivalent of
 gold leaf and curlicues that they have completely swamped the
 underlying design Called after the later and more extreme forms
 of Baroque architecture and decoration prevalent during the
 mid1700s in Europe Alan Perlis said Every program eventually
 becomes rococo and then rubble Compare critical

 2 imp Read The Fucking Standard this oath can only be used when
 the problem area eg a language or operating system interface has
 actually been codified in a ratified standards document The
 existence of these standards documents and the technically
 inappropriate but politically mandated compromises which they
 inevitably contain and the stifling language in which they are
 invariably written and the unbelievably tedious bureaucratic process
 by which they are produced can be unnerving to hackers who are used
 to a certain amount of ambiguity in the specifications of the systems
 they use Hackers feel that such ambiguities are acceptable as long
 as the Right Thing to do is obvious to any thinking observer
 sadly this casual attitude towards specifications becomes unworkable
 when a system becomes popular in the real world Since a hacker
 is likely to feel that a standards document is both unnecessary and
 technically deficient the deprecation inherent in this term may be
 directed as much against the standard as against the person who ought
 to read it

saga WPI n A cuspy but bogus raving story about N random
 broken people

 Here is a classic example of the saga form as told by Guy L
 Steele

 Jon L White login name JONL and I GLS were office mates at MIT
 for many years One April we both flew from Boston to California
 for a week on research business to consult facetoface with some
 people at Stanford particularly our mutual friend Richard P
 Gabriel RPG see Gabriel

 RPG picked us up at the San Francisco airport and drove us back to
 Palo Alto going logical south on route 101 parallel to El
 Camino Bignum Palo Alto is adjacent to Stanford University and
 about 40 miles south of San Francisco We ate at The Good Earth a
 health food restaurant very popular the sort whose milkshakes
 all contain honey and protein powder JONL ordered such a shake
  the waitress claimed the flavor of the day was lalaberry I
 still have no idea what that might be but it became a running
 joke It was the color of raspberry and JONL said it tasted
 rather bitter I ate a better tostada there than I have ever had
 in a Mexican restaurant

 After this we went to the local Uncle Gaylords Old Fashioned Ice
 Cream Parlor They make ice cream fresh daily in a variety of
 intriguing flavors Its a chain and they have a slogan If you
 dont live near an Uncle Gaylords  MOVE Also Uncle Gaylord
 a real person wages a constant battle to force bigname ice cream
 makers to print their ingredients on the package like air and
 plastic and other nonnatural garbage JONL and I had first
 discovered Uncle Gaylords the previous August when we had flown
 to a computerscience conference in Berkeley California the first
 time either of us had been on the West Coast When not in the
 conference sessions we had spent our time wandering the length of
 Telegraph Avenue which like Harvard Square in Cambridge was
 lined with picturesque street vendors and interesting little shops
 On that street we discovered Uncle Gaylords Berkeley store The
 ice cream there was very good During that August visit JONL went
 absolutely bananas so to speak over one particular flavor ginger
 honey

 Therefore after eating at The Good Earth  indeed after every
 lunch and dinner and before bed during our April visit  a trip
 to Uncle Gaylords the one in Palo Alto was mandatory We had
 arrived on a Wednesday and by Thursday evening we had been there
 at least four times Each time JONL would get ginger honey ice
 cream and proclaim to all bystanders that Ginger was the spice
 that drove the Europeans mad Thats why they sought a route to
 the East They used it to preserve their otherwise offtaste
 meat After the third or fourth repetition RPG and I were getting
 a little tired of this spiel and began to paraphrase him Wow
 Ginger The spice that makes rotten meat taste good Say Why
 dont we find some dog thats been run over and sat in the sun for
 a week and put some ginger on it for dinner Right With a
 lalaberry shake And so on This failed to faze JONL he took it
 in good humor as long as we kept returning to Uncle Gaylords He
 loves ginger honey ice cream

 Now RPG and his thenwife KBT Kathy Tracy were putting us up
 putting up with us in their home for our visit so to thank them
 JONL and I took them out to a nice French restaurant of their
 choosing I unadventurously chose the filet mignon and KBT had je
 ne sais quoi du jour but RPG and JONL had lapin rabbit
 Waitress Oui we have fresh rabbit fresh today RPG Well
 JONL I guess we wont need any ginger

 We finished the meal late about 11 PM which is 2 AM Boston
 time so JONL and I were rather droopy But it wasnt yet
 midnight Off to Uncle Gaylords

 Now the French restaurant was in Redwood City north of Palo Alto
 In leaving Redwood City we somehow got onto route 101 going north
 instead of south JONL and I wouldnt have known the difference
 had RPG not mentioned it We still knew very little of the local
 geography I did figure out however that we were headed in the
 direction of Berkeley and halfjokingly suggested that we continue
 north and go to Uncle Gaylords in Berkeley

 RPG said Fine and we drove on for a while and talked I was
 drowsy and JONL actually dropped off to sleep for 5 minutes When
 he awoke RPG said Gee JONL you must have slept all the way
 over the bridge referring to the one spanning San Francisco Bay
 Just then we came to a sign that said University Avenue I
 mumbled something about working our way over to Telegraph Avenue
 RPG said Right and maneuvered some more Eventually we pulled
 up in front of an Uncle Gaylords

 Now I hadnt really been paying attention because I was so sleepy
 and I didnt really understand what was happening until RPG let me
 in on it a few moments later but I was just alert enough to notice
 that we had somehow come to the Palo Alto Uncle Gaylords after
 all

 JONL noticed the resemblance to the Palo Alto store but hadnt
 caught on The place is lit with red and yellow lights at night
 and looks much different from the way it does in daylight He
 said This isnt the Uncle Gaylords I went to in Berkeley It
 looked like a barn But this place looks just like the one back
 in Palo Alto

 RPG deadpanned Well this is the one I always come to when Im
 in Berkeley Theyve got two in San Francisco too Remember
 theyre a chain

 JONL accepted this bit of wisdom And he was not totally ignorant
  he knew perfectly well that University Avenue was in Berkeley
 not far from Telegraph Avenue What he didnt know was that there
 is a completely different University Avenue in Palo Alto

 JONL went up to the counter and asked for ginger honey The guy at
 the counter asked whether JONL would like to taste it first
 evidently their standard procedure with that flavor as not too
 many people like it

 JONL said Im sure I like it Just give me a cone The guy
 behind the counter insisted that JONL try just a taste first
 Some people think it tastes like soap JONL insisted Look I
 love ginger I eat Chinese food I eat raw ginger roots I
 already went through this hassle with the guy back in Palo Alto I
 know I like that flavor

 At the words back in Palo Alto the guy behind the counter got a
 very strange look on his face but said nothing KBT caught his
 eye and winked Through my stupor I still hadnt quite grasped
 what was going on and thought RPG was rolling on the floor
 laughing and clutching his stomach just because JONL had launched
 into his spiel makes rotten meat a dish for princes for the
 fortythird time At this point RPG clued me in fully

 RPG KBT and I retreated to a table trying to stifle our
 chuckles JONL remained at the counter talking about ice cream
 with the guy btc comparing Uncle Gaylords to other ice cream
 shops and generally having a good old time

 At length the gbtc said Hows the ginger honey JONL said
 Fine I wonder what exactly is in it Now Uncle Gaylord
 publishes all his recipes and even teaches classes on how to make
 his ice cream at home So the gbtc got out the recipe and he
 and JONL pored over it for a while But the gbtc could contain
 his curiosity no longer and asked again You really like that
 stuff huh JONL said Yeah Ive been eating it constantly back
 in Palo Alto for the past two days In fact I think this batch is
 about as good as the cones I got back in Palo Alto

 Gbtc looked him straight in the eye and said Youre in Palo
 Alto

 JONL turned slowly around and saw the three of us collapse in a
 fit of giggles He clapped a hand to his forehead and exclaimed
 Ive been hacked

 My spies on the West Coast inform me that there is a close relative
 of the raspberry found out there called an olallieberry  ESR

 Ironic footnote it appears that the meme about ginger vs
 rotting meat may be an urban legend Its not borne out by an
 examination of medieval recipes or period purchase records for
 spices and appears fullblown in the works of Samuel Pegge a
 gourmand and notorious flake case who originated numerous food
 myths  ESR

 salesperson Hackers tell the following joke

 Q Whats the difference between a usedcar dealer and a
 computer salesman
 A The usedcar dealer knows hes lying Some versions add
 and probably knows how to drive

 This reflects the widespread hacker belief that salescritters are
 selfselected for stupidity after all if they had brains and the
 inclination to use them theyd be in programming The terms
 salesthing and salesdroid are also common Compare
 marketroid suit droid

 culture of samurai that meets electronically on BBS systems mostly
 bright teenagers with personal micros they have modeled
 themselves explicitly on the historical samurai of Japan and on the
 net cowboys of William Gibsons cyberpunk novels Those
 interviewed claim to adhere to a rigid ethic of loyalty to their
 employers and to disdain the vandalism and theft practiced by
 criminal crackers as beneath them and contrary to the hacker ethic

sanity check n 1 The act of checking a piece of code or
 anything else eg a USENET posting for completely stupid mistakes
 Implies that the check is to make sure the author was sane when it
 was written eg if a piece of scientific software relied on a
 particular formula and was giving unexpected results one might
 first look at the nesting of parentheses or the coding of the
 formula as a sanity check before looking at the more complex
 IO or data structure manipulation routines much less the
 algorithm itself Compare reality check 2 A runtime test
 either validating input or ensuring that the program hasnt screwed
 up internally producing an inconsistent value or state

Saturdaynight special from police slang for a cheap handgun n

 mount a scratch monkey a proverb used to advise caution
 when dealing with irreplaceable data or devices Used to refer to

 This term preserves the memory of Mabel the Swimming Wonder
 Monkey star of a biological research program at the University of
 Toronto ca 1986 Mabel was not so the legend goes your ordinary
 monkey the university had spent years teaching her how to swim
 breathing through a regulator in order to study the effects of
 different gas mixtures on her physiology Mabel suffered an
 untimely demise one day when DEC PMed the PDP11 controlling
 her regulator see also provocative maintenance

 It is recorded that after calming down an understandably irate
 customer sufficiently to ascertain the facts of the matter a DEC
 troubleshooter called up the field circus manager responsible
 and asked him sweetly Can you swim

 Not all the consequences to humans were so amusing the sysop of
 the machine in question was nearly thrown in jail at the behest of
 certain clueless droids at the local humane society The moral
 is clear When in doubt always mount a scratch monkey

screw MIT n A lose usually in software Especially used for
 uservisible misbehavior caused by a bug or misfeature This use
 has become quite widespread outside MIT

screwage skrooj n Like lossage but connotes that the
 failure is due to a designedin misfeature rather than a simple
 inadequacy or a mere bug

scribble n To modify a data structure in a random and
 unintentionally destructive way Bletch Somebodys
 diskcompactor program went berserk and scribbled on the inode
 table It was working fine until one of the allocation routines
 scribbled on low core Synonymous with trash compare mung

 to scribble or mangle

scrool skrool from the pioneering Roundtable chat system in
 Houston ca 1984 prob originated as a typo for scroll n The
 log of old messages available for later perusal or to help one get
 back in synch with the conversation It was originally called the
 scrool monster because an early version of the roundtable
 software had a bug where it would dump all 8K of scrool on a users
 terminal

scrozzle skrozl vt Used when a selfmodifying code segment runs
 incorrectly and corrupts the running program or vital data The
 damn compiler scrozzled itself again

scruffies n See neats vs scruffies

SCSI Small Computer System Interface n A busindependent
 standard for systemlevel interfacing between a computer and
 intelligent devices Typically annotated in literature with sexy
 seksee sissy sisee and scuzzy skuhzee as
 pronunciation guides  the last being the overwhelmingly
 predominant form much to the dismay of the designers and their
 marketing people One can usually assume that a person who
 pronounces it SCSI is clueless

ScumOS n Unflattering hackerism for SunOS the UNIX variant
 supported on Sun Microsystemss UNIX workstations see also
 sunstools and compare AIDX terminak
 Macintrash Nominal Semidestructor Open DeathTrap
 HPSUX Despite what this term might suggest Sun was
 founded by hackers and still enjoys excellent relations with
 hackerdom usage is more often in exasperation than outright
 loathing

searchanddestroy mode n Hackerism for the searchandreplace
 facility in an editor so called because an incautiously chosen
 match pattern can cause infinite damage

secondsystem effect n sometimes more euphoniously
 secondsystem syndrome When one is designing the successor to
 a relatively small elegant and successful system there is a
 tendency to become grandiose in ones success and design an
 elephantine featureladen monstrosity The term was first
 used by Fred Brooks in his classic The Mythical ManMonth
 Essays on Software Engineering AddisonWesley 1975 ISBN
 0201006502 It described the jump from a set of nice simple
 operating systems on the IBM 70xx series to OS360 on the
 360 series A similar effect can also happen in an evolving
 system see Brookss Law creeping elegance creeping
 featurism See also Multics OS2 X software
 bloat

 This version of the jargon lexicon has been described with
 altogether too much truth for comfort as an example of
 secondsystem effect run amok on jargon1

secondary damage n When a fatal error occurs esp a
 segfault the immediate cause may be that a pointer has been
 trashed due to a previous fandango on core However this
 fandango may have been due to an earlier fandango so no
 amount of analysis will reveal directly how the damage occurred
 The data structure was clobbered but it was secondary damage

 By extension the corruption resulting from N cascaded
 fandangoes on core is Nthlevel damage There is at least
 one case on record in which 17 hours of grovelling with
 adb actually dug up the underlying bug behind an instance of
 seventhlevel damage The hacker who accomplished this
 nearsuperhuman feat was presented with an award by his fellows

security through obscurity n A name applied by hackers to most
 OS vendors favorite way of coping with security holes  namely
 ignoring them and not documenting them and trusting that nobody
 will find out about them and that people who do find out about them
 wont exploit them This never works for long and occasionally
 sets the world up for debacles like the RTM worm of 1988 see
 Great Worm the but once the brief moments of panic created
 by such events subside most vendors are all too willing to turn
 over and go back to sleep After all actually fixing the bugs
 would siphon off the resources needed to implement the next
 userinterface frill on marketings wish list  and besides if
 they started fixing security bugs customers might begin to
 expect it and imagine that their warranties of
 merchantability gave them some sort of right to a system
 with fewer holes in it than a shotgunned Swiss cheese and
 then where would we be

 Historical note There are conflicting stories about the origin of
 this term It has been claimed that it was first used in the
 USENET newsgroup in compsysapollo during a campaign to get
 HPApollo to fix security problems in its UNIXclone
 AegisDomainOS they didnt change a thing ITS fans on the
 other hand say it was coined years earlier in opposition to the
 incredibly paranoid Multics people down the hall for whom
 security was everything In the ITS culture it referred to 1 the
 fact that that by the time a tourist figured out how to make
 trouble hed generally gotten over the urge to make it because he
 felt part of the community and 2 selfmockingly the poor
 coverage of the documentation and obscurity of many commands One
 instance of deliberate security through obscurity is
 recorded the command to allow patching the running ITS system
 altmode altmode controlR echoed as D If you actually
 typed alt alt D that set a flag which would prevent patching the
 system even if you later got it right

segfault nvi Syn segment seggie

seggie segee UNIX n Shorthand for segmentation fault
 reported from Britain

segment segment vi To experience a segmentation fault
 Confusingly this is often pronounced more like the noun segment
 than like mainstream v segment this is because it is actually a
 noun shorthand that has been verbed

segmentation fault n UNIX 1 An error in which a running program
 attempts to access memory not allocated to it and core dumps
 with a segmentation violation error 2 To lose a train of
 thought or a line of reasoning Also uttered as an exclamation at

SEX seks Sun Users Group  elsewhere n 1 Software
 EXchange A technique invented by the bluegreen algae hundreds of
 millions of years ago to speed up their evolution which had been
 terribly slow up until then Today SEX parties are popular among
 hackers and others of course these are no longer limited to
 exchanges of genetic software In general SEX parties are a
 Good Thing but unprotected SEX can propagate a virus
 See also pubic directory 2 The rather Freudian mnemonic
 often used for Sign EXtend a machine instruction found in the
 PDP11 and many other architectures The RCA 1802 chip used in the
 early Elf and SuperElf personal computers had a SEt X register
 SEX instruction but this seems to have had little folkloric
 impact

 DECs engineers nearly got a PDP11 assembler that used the
 SEX mnemonic out the door at one time but for once
 marketing wasnt asleep and forced a change That wasnt the last
 time this happened either The author of The Intel 8086
 Primer who was one of the original designers of the 8086 noted
 that there was originally a SEX instruction on that
 processor too He says that Intel management got cold feet and
 decreed that it be changed and thus the instruction was renamed
 CBW and CWD depending on what was being extended
 Amusingly the Intel 8048 the microcontroller used in IBM PC
 keyboards is also missing straight SEX but has logicalor
 and logicaland instructions ORL and ANL

 The Motorola 6809 used in the UKs Dragon 32 personal
 computer actually had an official SEX instruction the 6502
 in the Apple II it competed with did not British hackers thought
 this made perfect mythic sense after all it was commonly
 observed you could on some theoretical level have sex with a
 dragon but you cant have sex with an apple

sex changer n Syn gender mender

shambolic link n A UNIX symbolic link particularly when it
 confuses you points to nothing at all or results in you ending up

shell orig Multics techspeak widely propagated via UNIX n
 1 techspeak The command interpreter used to pass commands to an
 operating system so called because it is the part of the operating
 system that interfaces with the outside world 2 More generally
 any interface program that mediates access to a special resource
 or server for convenience efficiency or security reasons for
 this meaning the usage is usually a shell around whatever
 This sort of program is also called a wrapper

shell out UNIX n To spawn an interactive subshell from
 within a program eg a mailer or editor Bang foo runs foo in
 a subshell while bang alone shells out

shift left or right logical from any of various machines
 instruction sets 1 vi To move oneself to the left right To
 move out of the way 2 imper Get out of that my seat You
 can shift to that empty one to the left right Often
 used without the logical or as left shift instead of
 shift left Sometimes heard as LSH lish from the PDP10
 instruction set See Programmers Cheer

shim n A small piece of data inserted in order to achieve a
 desired memory alignment or other addressing property For
 example the PDP11 UNIX linker in split ID instructions and
 data mode inserts a twobyte shim at location 0 in data space so
 that no data object will have an address of 0 and be confused with
 the C null pointer See also loose bytes

shitogram shitohgram n A really nasty piece of email

 that a bug will be perturbed out of existence This almost never
 works and usually introduces more bugs

showstopper n A hardware or especially software bug that makes
 an implementation effectively unusable one that absolutely has to
 be fixed before development can go on Opposite in connotation
 from its original theatrical use which refers to something
 stunningly good

shriek n See excl Occasional CMU usage also in common use

 Noise and Imp of Call Waiting the hideous multitendriled entity
 formed of all the manifold connections of the net A sect of
 MUDders worships ShubInternet sacrificing objects and praying for
 good connections To no avail  its purpose is malign and evil
 and is the cause of all network slowdown Often heard as in
 Freela casts a tac nuke at ShubInternet for slowing her down
 A forged response often follows along the lines of
 ShubInternet gulps down the tac nuke and burps happily Also
 cursed by users of FTP and telnet when the system slows
 down The dread name of ShubInternet is seldom spoken aloud as
 it is said that repeating it three times will cause the being to
 wake deep within its lair beneath the Pentagon

SIG n The Association for Computing Machinery traditionally
 sponsors Special Interest Groups in various technical areas
 wellknown ones include SIGARCH the Special Interest Group for
 Computer Architecture and SIGGRAPH the Special Interest Group for
 Computer Graphics Hackers not surprisingly like to overextend
 this naming convention to less formal associations like SIGBEER at
 ACM conferences and SIGFOOD at University of Illinois

sig block sig blok UNIX often written sig there n
 Short for signature used specifically to refer to the
 electronic signature block that most UNIX mail and newsposting
 software will automagically append to outgoing mail and news
 The composition of ones sig can be quite an art form including an
 ASCII logo or ones choice of witty sayings see sig quote
 fool file the but many consider large sigs a waste of
 bandwidth and it has been observed that the size of ones sig
 block is usually inversely proportional to ones longevity and
 level of prestige on the net

sig quote sig kwoht USENET n A maxim quote proverb joke
 or slogan embedded in ones sig block and intended to convey
 something of ones philosophical stance pet peeves or sense of
 humor Calm down its only ones and zeroes

sig virus n A parasitic meme embedded in a sig block
 There was a meme plague or fad for these on USENET in late
 1991 Most were equivalents of I am a sig virus Please reproduce
 me in your sig block Of course the sig viruss memetic hook
 is the giggle value of going along with the gag this however
 was a selflimiting phenomenon as more and more people picked up
 on the idea There were creative variants on it some people
 stuck sig virus antibody texts in their sigs and there was at
 least one instance of a sig virus eater

signaltonoise ratio from analog electronics n Used by hackers
 in a generalization of its technical meaning Signal refers to
 useful information conveyed by some communications medium and
 noise to anything else on that medium Hence a low ratio implies
 that it is not worth paying attention to the medium in question
 Figures for such metaphorical ratios are never given The term is
 most often applied to USENET newsgroups during flame wars
 Compare bandwidth See also coefficient of X lost in
 the noise

silicon n Hardware esp ICs or microprocessorbased computer
 systems compare iron Contrasted with software See also
 sandbender

silicon foundry n A company that fabs chips to the designs
 of others As of the late 1980s the combination of silicon
 foundries and good computeraided design software made it much
 easier for hardwaredesigning startup companies to come into being
 The downside of using a silicon foundry is that the distance from
 the actual chipfabrication processes reduces designers control of
 detail This is somewhat analogous to the use of HLLs versus

 procedure required to accomplish a task Like grovel but more
 random and humorous I had to sillywalk through half the
 usr directories to find the maps file 2 Syn fandango on
 core

silo n The FIFO inputcharacter buffer in an RS232 line card So
 called from DEC terminology used on DH and DZ line cards for the
 VAX and PDP11 presumably because it was a storage space for
 fungible stuff that you put in the top and took out the bottom

sitename sitnaym UNIXInternet n The unique electronic
 name of a computer system used to identify it in UUCP mail
 USENET or other forms of electronic information interchange The
 folklore interest of sitenames stems from the creativity and humor
 they often display Interpreting a sitename is not unlike
 interpreting a vanity license plate one has to mentally unpack it
 allowing for monocase and length restrictions and the lack of
 whitespace Hacker tradition deprecates dull
 institutionalsounding names in favor of punchy humorous and
 clever coinages except that it is considered appropriate for the
 official public gateway machine of an organization to bear the
 organizations name or acronym Mythological references cartoon
 characters animal names and allusions to SF or fantasy literature
 are probably the most popular sources for sitenames in roughly
 descending order The obligatory comment when discussing these is

skulker n Syn prowler

slap on the side n also called a sidecar or abbreviated
 SOTS A type of external expansion hardware marketed by
 computer manufacturers eg Commodore for the Amiga 5001000
 series and IBM for the hideous failure called PCjr Various
 SOTS boxes provided necessities such as memory hard drive
 controllers and conventional expansion slots

sleep vi 1 techspeak On a timesharing system a process that
 relinquishes its claim on the scheduler until some given event
 occurs or a specified time delay elapses is said to go to
 sleep 2 In jargon used very similarly to v block also
 in sleep on syn with block on Often used to
 indicate that the speaker has relinquished a demand for resources
 until some possibly unspecified external event They cant get
 the fix Ive been asking for into the next release so Im going to
 sleep on it until the release then start hassling them again

slim n A small derivative change eg to code

slop n 1 A onesided fudge factor that is an allowance for
 error but in only one of two directions For example if you need
 a piece of wire 10 feet long and have to guess when you cut it
 you make very sure to cut it too long by a large amount if
 necessary rather than too short by even a little bit because you
 can always cut off the slop but you cant paste it back on again
 When discrete quantities are involved slop is often introduced to
 avoid the possibility of being on the losing side of a fencepost
 error 2 The percentage of extra code generated by a compiler
 over the size of equivalent assembler code produced by
 handhacking ie the space or maybe time you lose because
 you didnt do it yourself This number is often used as a measure
 of the goodness of a compiler slop below 5 is very good and
 10 is usually acceptable With modern compiler technology esp
 on RISC machines the compilers slop may actually be
 negative that is humans may be unable to generate code as
 good This is one of the reasons assembler programming is no
 longer common

slopsucker slopsuhkr n A lowestpriority task that must
 wait around until everything else has had its fill of machine
 resources Only when the machine would otherwise be idle is the
 task allowed to suck up the slop Also called a hungry puppy
 or bottom feeder One common variety of slopsucker hunts for
 large prime numbers Compare background

slurp vt To read a large data file entirely into core before
 working on it This may be contrasted with the strategy of reading
 a small piece at a time processing it and then reading the next
 piece This program slurps in a 1Kby1K matrix and does
 an FFT See also sponge

smart adj Said of a program that does the Right Thing in a
 wide variety of complicated circumstances There is a difference
 between calling a program smart and calling it intelligent in
 particular there do not exist any intelligent programs yet 
 see AIcomplete Compare robust smart programs can be
 brittle

smart terminal n 1 A terminal that has enough computing capability
 to render graphics or to offload some kind of frontend processing
 from the computer it talks to The development of workstations and
 personal computers has made this term and the product it describes
 semiobsolescent but one may still hear variants of the phrase
 act like a smart terminal used to describe the behavior of
 workstations or PCs with respect to programs that execute almost
 entirely out of a remote servers storage using said devices
 as displays Compare glass tty 2 obs Any terminal with an
 addressable cursor the opposite of a glass tty Today a
 terminal with merely an addressable cursor but with none of the
 morepowerful features mentioned in sense 1 is called a dumb
 terminal

 There is a classic quote from Rob Pike inventor of the blit
 terminal A smart terminal is not a smartass terminal
 but rather a terminal you can educate This illustrates a common
 design problem The attempt to make peripherals or anything else
 intelligent sometimes results in finicky rigid special
 features that become just so much dead weight if you try to use
 the device in any way the designer didnt anticipate Flexibility
 and programmability on the other hand are really smart
 Compare hook

smash case vi To lose or obliterate the uppercaselowercase
 distinction in text input MSDOS will automatically smash case
 in the names of all the files you create Compare fold case

smash the stack C programming n On many C implementations it
 is possible to corrupt the execution stack by writing past the end
 of an array declared auto in a routine Code that does this
 is said to smash the stack and can cause return from the
 routine to jump to a random address This can produce some of the
 most insidious datadependent bugs known to mankind Variants
 include trash the stack scribble the stack mangle
 the stack the term mung the stack is not used as this is
 never done intentionally See spam see also aliasing
 bug fandango on core memory leak memory smash

smiley n See emoticon

smoke and mirrors n Marketing deceptions The term is
 mainstream in this general sense Among hackers its strongly
 associated with bogus demos and crocked benchmarks see also
 MIPS machoflops They claim their new box cranks 5
 MIPS for under 5000 but didnt specify the instruction mix 
 sounds like smoke and mirrors to me The phrase has been said to
 derive from carnie slang for magic acts and freak show displays
 that depend on trompe loeil effects but also calls to mind
 the fierce Aztec god Tezcatlipoca lit Smoking Mirror to whom
 mass human sacrifices were regularly made Upon hearing about a
 rigged demo or yet another round of fantasybased marketing
 promises hackers often feel similarly disheartened

smoke test n 1 A rudimentary form of testing applied to
 electronic equipment following repair or reconfiguration in which
 power is applied and the tester checks for sparks smoke or other
 dramatic signs of fundamental failure See magic smoke
 2 By extension the first run of a piece of software after
 construction or a critical change See and compare reality
 check

 There is an interesting semiparallel to this term among
 typographers and printers When new typefaces are being punchcut by
 hand a smoke test hold the letter in candle smoke then press
 it onto paper is used to check out new dies

smoking clover ITS n A display hack originally due to
 Bill Gosper Many convergent lines are drawn on a color monitor in
 AOS mode so that every pixel struck has its color
 incremented The lines all have one endpoint in the middle of the
 screen the other endpoints are spaced one pixel apart around the
 perimeter of a large square The color map is then repeatedly
 rotated This results in a striking rainbowhued shimmering
 fourleaf clover Gosper joked about keeping it hidden from the
 FDA the USs Food and Drug Administration lest its
 hallucinogenic properties cause it to be banned

SMOP SMOP Simple or Small Matter of Programming n
 1 A piece of code not yet written whose anticipated length is
 significantly greater than its complexity Used to refer to a
 program that could obviously be written but is not worth the
 trouble Also used ironically to imply that a difficult problem
 can be easily solved because a program can be written to do it the
 irony is that it is very clear that writing such a program will be
 a great deal of work Its easy to enhance a FORTRAN compiler to
 compile COBOL as well its just a SMOP 2 Often used
 ironically by the intended victim when a suggestion for a program
 is made which seems easy to the suggester but is obviously to the
 victim a lot of work

smurf smerf from the socmotss newsgroup on USENET
 after some obnoxiously gooey cartoon characters n A newsgroup
 regular with a habitual style that is irreverent silly and
 cute Like many other hackish terms for people this one may
 be praise or insult depending on who uses it In general being
 referred to as a smurf is probably not going to make your day
 unless youve previously adopted the label yourself in a spirit of
 irony Compare old fart

SNAFU principle snafoo prinsipl from WWII Army acronym
 for Situation Normal All Fucked Up n True communication is
 possible only between equals because inferiors are more
 consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant lies
 than for telling the truth  a central tenet of
 Discordianism often invoked by hackers to explain why
 authoritarian hierarchies screw up so reliably and systematically
 The effect of the SNAFU principle is a progressive disconnection of
 decisionmakers from reality This lightly adapted version of a
 fable dating back to the early 1960s illustrates the phenomenon
 perfectly

 In the beginning was the plan
 and then the specification
 And the plan was without form
 and the specification was void

 And darkness
 was on the faces of the implementors thereof
 And they spake unto their leader
 saying
 It is a crock of shit
 and smells as of a sewer

 And the leader took pity on them
 and spoke to the project leader
 It is a crock of excrement
 and none may abide the odor thereof

 And the project leader
 spake unto his section head saying
 It is a container of excrement
 and it is very strong such that none may abide it

 The section head then hurried to his department manager
 and informed him thus
 It is a vessel of fertilizer
 and none may abide its strength

 The department manager carried these words
 to his general manager
 and spoke unto him
 saying
 It containeth that which aideth the growth of plants
 and it is very strong

 And so it was that the general manager rejoiced
 and delivered the good news unto the Vice President
 It promoteth growth
 and it is very powerful

 The Vice President rushed to the Presidents side
 and joyously exclaimed
 This powerful new software product
 will promote the growth of the company

 And the President looked upon the product
 and saw that it was very good

 After the subsequent disaster the suits protect themselves by
 saying I was misinformed and the implementors are demoted or
 fired

snail vt To snailmail something Snail me a copy of those
 graphics will you

snailmail n Paper mail as opposed to electronic Sometimes
 written as the single word SnailMail Ones postal address is
 correspondingly a snail address Derives from earlier coinage
 USnail from US Mail for which there have been
 parody posters and stamps made Oppose email

snap v To replace a pointer to a pointer with a direct pointer
 to replace an old address with the forwarding address found there
 If you telephone the main number for an institution and ask for a
 particular person by name the operator may tell you that persons
 extension before connecting you in the hopes that you will snap
 your pointer and dial direct next time The underlying metaphor
 may be that of a rubber band stretched through a number of
 intermediate points if you remove all the thumbtacks in the
 middle it snaps into a straight line from first to last See
 chase pointers

 Often the behavior of a trampoline is to perform an error
 check once and then snap the pointer that invoked it so as
 henceforth to bypass the trampoline and its oneshot error check
 In this context one also speaks of snapping links For
 example in a Lisp implementation a function interface trampoline
 might check to make sure that the caller is passing the correct
 number of arguments if it is and if the caller and the callee are
 both compiled then snapping the link allows that particular path
 to use a direct procedurecall instruction with no further
 overhead

software bloat n The results of secondsystem effect or
 creeping featuritis Commonly cited examples include
 ls1 X BSD Missedemfive and OS2

software rot n Term used to describe the tendency of software
 that has not been used in a while to lose such failure may be
 semihumorously ascribed to bit rot More commonly
 software rot strikes when a programs assumptions become out
 of date If the design was insufficiently robust this may
 cause it to fail in mysterious ways

 For example owing to endemic shortsightedness in the design of
 COBOL programs most will succumb to software rot when their
 2digit year counters wrap around at the beginning of the
 year 2000 Actually related lossages often afflict centenarians
 who have to deal with computer software designed by unimaginative
 clods One such incident became the focus of a minor public flap
 in 1990 when a gentleman born in 1889 applied for a drivers
 license renewal in Raleigh North Carolina The new system
 refused to issue the card probably because with 2digit years the
 ages 101 and 1 cannot be distinguished

 Historical note Software rot in an even funnier sense than the
 mythical one was a real problem on early research computers eg
 the R1 see grind crank If a program that depended on a
 peculiar instruction hadnt been run in quite a while the user
 might discover that the opcodes no longer did the same things they
 once did Hey soandso needs an instruction to do
 suchandsuch We can snarf this opcode right No one uses
 it

 Another classic example of this sprang from the time an MIT hacker
 found a simple way to double the speed of the unconditional jump
 instruction on a PDP6 so he patched the hardware Unfortunately
 this broke some fragile timing software in a musicplaying program
 throwing its output out of tune This was fixed by adding a
 defensive initialization routine to compare the speed of a timing
 loop with the realtime clock in other words it figured out how
 fast the PDP6 was that day and corrected appropriately

 Compare bit rot

SOS nobs SOS 1 An infamously losing text editor
 Once back in the 1960s when a text editor was needed for the
 PDP6 a hacker crufted together a quickanddirty stopgap
 editor to be used until a better one was written Unfortunately
 the old one was never really discarded when new ones in
 particular TECO came along SOS is a descendant Son of
 Stopgap of that editor and many PDP10 users gained the dubious
 pleasure of its acquaintance Since then other programs similar in
 style to SOS have been written notably the early font editor BILOS
 byelohs the BrotherInLaw Of Stopgap the alternate expansion
 Bastard Issue Loins of Stopgap has been proposed 2 sos
 n To decrease inverse of AOS from the PDP10 instruction
 set

source of all good bits n A person from whom or a place from
 which useful information may be obtained If you need to know
 about a program a guru might be the source of all good bits
 The title is often applied to a particularly competent secretary

spacecadet keyboard n A nowlegendary device used on MIT LISP
 machines which inspired several stillcurrent jargon terms and
 influenced the design of EMACS It was equipped with no
 fewer than seven shift keys four keys for bucky bits
 control meta hyper and super and three like
 regular shift keys called shift top and front Many
 keys had three symbols on them a letter and a symbol on the top
 and a Greek letter on the front For example the L key had an
 L and a twoway arrow on the top and the Greek letter lambda on
 the front By pressing this key with the right hand while playing
 an appropriate chord with the left hand on the shift keys you
 can get the following results

 L
 lowercase l

 shiftL
 uppercase L

 frontL
 lowercase lambda

 frontshiftL
 uppercase lambda

 topL
 twoway arrow
 front and shift are ignored

 And of course each of these might also be typed with any
 combination of the control meta hyper and super keys On this
 keyboard you could type over 8000 different characters This
 allowed the user to type very complicated mathematical text and
 also to have thousands of singlecharacter commands at his
 disposal Many hackers were actually willing to memorize the
 command meanings of that many characters if it reduced typing time
 this attitude obviously shaped the interface of EMACS Other
 hackers however thought having that many bucky bits was overkill
 and objected that such a keyboard can require three or four hands
 to operate See bucky bits cokebottle double bucky
 meta bit quadruple bucky

 Note early versions of this entry incorrectly identified the
 spacecadet keyboard with the Knight keyboard Though both
 were designed by Tom Knight the latter term was properly applied
 only to a keyboard used for ITS on the PDP10 and modeled
 on the Stanford keyboard as described under bucky bits The
 true spacecadet keyboard evolved from the Knight keyboard

SPACEWAR n A spacecombat simulation game inspired by
 E E Doc Smiths Lensman books in which two spaceships
 duel around a central sun shooting torpedoes at each other and
 jumping through hyperspace This game was first implemented on the
 PDP1 at MIT in 196061 SPACEWAR aficionados formed the core of
 the early hacker culture at MIT Nine years later a descendant
 of the game motivated Ken Thompson to build in his spare time on a
 scavenged PDP7 the operating system that became UNIX Less
 than nine years after that SPACEWAR was commercialized as one of
 the first video games descendants are still feeping in video
 arcades everywhere

spaghetti code n Code with a complex and tangled control
 structure esp one using many GOTOs exceptions or other
 unstructured branching constructs Pejorative The synonym
 kangaroo code has been reported doubtless because such code
 has many jumps in it

spaghetti inheritance n encountered among users of objectoriented
 languages that use inheritance such as Smalltalk A convoluted
 classsubclass graph often resulting from carelessly deriving
 subclasses from other classes just for the sake of reusing their
 code Coined in a successful attempt to discourage such
 practice through guiltbyassociation with spaghetti code

spam from the MUD community vt To crash a program by overrunning
 a fixedsize buffer with excessively large input data See also
 buffer overflow overrun screw smash the stack

specialcase vt To write unique code to handle input to or
 situations arising in program that are somehow distinguished from
 normal processing This would be used for processing of mode
 switches or interrupt characters in an interactive interface as
 opposed say to text entry or normal commands or for processing
 of hidden flags in the input of a batch program or filter

speedometer n A pattern of lights displayed on a linear set of
 LEDs today or nixie tubes yesterday on ancient mainframes
 The pattern is shifted left every N times the software goes
 through its main loop A swiftly moving pattern indicates that the
 system is mostly idle the speedometer slows down as the system
 becomes overloaded The speedometer on Sun Microsystems hardware
 bounces back and forth like the eyes on one of the Cylons from the
 wretched Battlestar Galactica TV series

 actually had an analog speedometer on the front panel
 calibrated in instructions executed per second

spike v To defeat a selection mechanism by introducing a
 sometimes temporary device which forces a specific result The
 word is used in several industries telephone engineers refer to
 spiking a relay by inserting a pin to hold the relay in either the
 closed or open state and railroaders refer to spiking a
 track switch so that it cannot be moved In programming
 environments it normally refers to a temporary change usually for
 testing purposes as opposed to a permanent change which would be
 called hardwired

spod Great Britain n A lower form of life found on talker
 systems and MUDs The spod has few friends in RL and
 uses talkers instead finding communication easier and preferable
 over the net He has all the negative traits of the computer
 geek without having any interest in computers per se Lacking any
 knowledge of or interest in how networks work and considering his
 access a Godgiven right he is a major irritant to sysadmins
 clogging up lines in order to reach new MUDs following passedon
 instructions on how to sneak his way onto Internet Wow Its in
 America and complaining when he is not allowed to use busy
 routes A true spod will start any conversation with Are you

sponge UNIX n A special case of a filter that reads its
 entire input before writing any output the canonical example is a
 sort utility Unlike most filters a sponge can conveniently
 overwrite the input file with the output data stream If your file
 system has versioning as ITS did and VMS does now the
 spongefilter distinction loses its usefulness because directing
 filter output would just write a new version See also slurp

spooge spooj 1 n Inexplicable or arcane code or random
 and probably incorrect output from a computer program 2 vi To
 generate spooge sense 1

spool from early IBM Simultaneous Peripheral Operation
 OnLine but this acronym is widely thought to have been contrived
 for effect vt To send files to some device or program a
 spooler that queues them up and does something useful with
 them later The spooler usually understood is the print
 spooler controlling output of jobs to a printer but the term has
 been used in connection with other peripherals especially plotters
 and graphics devices and occasionally even for input devices See
 also demon

spool file n Any file to which data is spooled to await the
 next stage of processing Especially used in circumstances where
 spooling the data copes with a mismatch between speeds in two
 devices or pieces of software For example when you send mail
 under UNIX its typically copied to a spool file to await a
 transport demons attentions This is borderline techspeak

square tape n Mainframe magnetic tape cartridges for use with IBM 3480
 or compatible tape drives The term comes from the square actually
 rectangular shape of the cartridges contrast round tape

stack n A persons stack is the set of things he or she has to do
 in the future One speaks of the next project to be attacked as
 having risen to the top of the stack Im afraid Ive got real
 work to do so thisll have to be pushed way down on my stack
 I havent done it yet because every time I pop my stack something
 new gets pushed If you are interrupted several times in the
 middle of a conversation My stack overflowed means I
 forget what we were talking about The implication is that more
 items were pushed onto the stack than could be remembered so the
 least recent items were lost The usual physical example of a
 stack is to be found in a cafeteria a pile of plates or trays
 sitting on a spring in a well so that when you put one on the top
 they all sink down and when you take one off the top the rest
 spring up a bit See also push and pop

 At MIT pdl used to be a more common synonym for stack in
 all these contexts and this may still be true Everywhere else
 stack seems to be the preferred term Knuth
 The Art of Computer Programming second edition vol 1
 p 236 says

 Many people who realized the importance of stacks and queues
 independently have given other names to these structures
 stacks have been called pushdown lists reversion storages
 cellars nesting stores piles lastinfirstout LIFO
 lists and even yoyo lists

stack puke n Some processor architectures are said to puke their
 guts onto the stack to save their internal state during exception
 processing The Motorola 68020 for example regurgitates up to
 92 bytes on a bus fault On a pipelined machine this can take a
 while

stale pointer bug n Synonym for aliasing bug used esp among
 microcomputer hackers

state n 1 Condition situation Whats the state of your

 state The standard question Whats your state means
 What are you doing or What are you about to do Typical
 answers are about to gronk out or hungry Another
 standard question is Whats the state of the world meaning
 Whats new or Whats going on The more terse and
 humorous way of asking these questions would be Statep
 Another way of phrasing the first question under sense 1 would be
 statep latest hack 2 Information being maintained in
 nonpermanent memory electronic or human

Stone Age n adj 1 In computer folklore an illdefined period
 from ENIAC ca 1943 to the mid1950s the great age of
 electromechanical dinosaurs Sometimes used for the entire
 period up to 196061 see Iron Age however it is funnier
 and more descriptive to characterize the latter period in terms of
 a Bronze Age era of transistorlogic preferritecore
 machines with drum or CRT mass storage as opposed to just mercury
 delay lines andor relays See also Iron Age 2 More
 generally a pejorative for any crufty ancient piece of hardware
 or software technology Note that this is used even by people who
 were there for the Stone Age sense 1

stone knives and bearskins ITS prob from the Star Trek Classic
 episode The City on the Edge of Forever n A term traditionally
 used by ITS fans to describe and deprecate computing
 environments they regard as less advanced with the often

Stupids n Term used by samurai for the suits who
 employ them succinctly expresses an attitude at least as common
 though usually better disguised among other subcultures of
 hackers There may be intended reference here to an SF story
 originally published in 1952 but much anthologized since Mark
 Cliftons Star Bright In it a supergenius child
 classifies humans into a very few Brights like herself a huge
 majority of Stupids and a minority of Tweens the merely
 ordinary geniuses

subshell suhbshel UNIX MSDOS n An OS command interpreter
 see shell spawned from within a program such that exit from
 the command interpreter returns one to the parent program in a
 state that allows it to continue execution Compare shell out
 oppose chain

sucking mud Applied Data Research adj also pumping
 mud Crashed or wedged Usually said of a machine that provides
 some service to a network such as a file server This Dallas
 regionalism derives from the East Texas oilfield lament Shut
 er down Ma shes asuckin mud Often used as a query We
 are going to reconfigure the network are you ready to suck mud

sufficiently small adj Syn suitably small

suit n 1 Ugly and uncomfortable business clothing often
 worn by nonhackers Invariably worn with a tie a
 strangulation device that partially cuts off the blood supply to
 the brain It is thought that this explains much about the
 behavior of suitwearers Compare droid 2 A person who
 habitually wears suits as distinct from a techie or hacker See
 loser burble management Stupids SNAFU
 Principle and braindamaged English by the way is
 relatively kind our Moscow correspondent informs us that the
 corresponding idiom in Russian hacker jargon is sovok lit a
 tool for grabbing garbage

suitable win n See win

suitably small perverted from mathematical jargon adj An
 expression used ironically to characterize unquantifiable
 behavior that differs from expected or required behavior For
 example suppose a newly created program came up with a correct
 fullscreen display and one publicly exclaimed It works
 Then if the program dumps core on the first mouse click one might
 add Well for suitably small values of works Compare
 the characterization of pi under random numbers

sun lounge Great Britain n The room where all the Sun
 workstations live The humor in this term comes from the fact
 that its also in mainstream use to describe a solarium and all
 those Sun workstations clustered together give off an amazing
 amount of heat

sunstools n Unflattering hackerism for SunTools a preX
 windowing environment notorious in its day for size slowness and
 misfeatures X however is larger and slower see
 secondsystem effect

sunspots n 1 Notional cause of an odd error Why did the
 program suddenly turn the screen blue Sunspots I guess
 2 Also the cause of bit rot  from the myth that sunspots
 will increase cosmic rays which can flip single bits in memory
 See cosmic rays phase of the moon

superprogrammer n A prolific programmer one who can code
 exceedingly well and quickly Not all hackers are
 superprogrammers but many are Productivity can vary from one
 programmer to another by three orders of magnitude For example
 one programmer might be able to write an average of 3 lines of
 working code in one day while another with the proper tools
 might be able to write 3000 This range is astonishing it is
 matched in very few other areas of human endeavor The term
 superprogrammer is more commonly used within such places as IBM
 than in the hacker community It tends to stress naive measures
 of productivity and to underweight creativity ingenuity and
 getting the job done  and to sidestep the question of
 whether the 3000 lines of code do more or less useful work than
 three lines that do the Right Thing Hackers tend to prefer
 the terms hacker and wizard

superuser UNIX n Syn root avatar This usage has
 spread to nonUNIX environments the superuser is any account with
 all wheel bits on A more specific term than wheel

support n Aftersale handholding something many software
 vendors promise but few deliver To hackers most support people
 are useless  because by the time a hacker calls support he or
 she will usually know the relevant manuals better than the support
 people sadly this is not a joke or exaggeration A
 hackers idea of support is a teteatete with the
 softwares designer

 bytes in a file 2 n The program in V7 UNIX used to perform this
 action or anything functionally equivalent to it See also

swap vt 1 techspeak To move information from a fastaccess
 memory to a slowaccess memory swap out or vice versa
 swap in Often refers specifically to the use of disks as
 virtual memory As pieces of data or program are needed they
 are swapped into core for processing when they are no longer
 needed they may be swapped out again 2 The jargon use of these
 terms analogizes peoples shortterm memories with core Cramming
 for an exam might be spoken of as swapping in If you temporarily
 forget someones name but then remember it your excuse is that it
 was swapped out To keep something swapped in means to keep it
 fresh in your memory I reread the TECO manual every few months
 to keep it swapped in If someone interrupts you just as you got
 a good idea you might say Wait a moment while I swap this
 out implying that the piece of paper is your extrasomatic
 memory and if you dont swap the info out by writing it down it
 will get overwritten and lost as you talk Compare page in
 page out

swap space n Storage space especially temporary storage space
 used during a move or reconfiguration Im just using that corner
 of the machine room for swap space

swapped in n See swap See also page in

swapped out n See swap See also page out

swizzle v To convert external names array indices or references
 within a data structure into address pointers when the data
 structure is brought into main memory from external storage also
 called pointer swizzling this may be done for speed in
 chasing references or to simplify code eg by turning lots of
 name lookups into pointer dereferences The converse operation is
 sometimes termed unswizzling See also snap

sync sink var synch n vi 1 To synchronize to
 bring into synchronization 2 techspeak To force all pending
 IO to the disk see flush sense 2 3 More generally to
 force a number of competing processes or agents to a state that
 would be safe if the system were to crash thus to checkpoint

syntactic sugar coined by Peter Landin n Features added to a
 language or other formalism to make it sweeter for humans
 that do not affect the expressiveness of the formalism compare
 chrome Used esp when there is an obvious and trivial
 translation of the sugar feature into other constructs already
 present in the notation Cs ai notation is syntactic
 sugar for a  i Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the
 semicolon  Alan Perlis

 The variants syntactic saccharine and syntactic syrup are
 also recorded These denotes something even more gratuitous in
 that syntactic sugar serves a purpose making something more
 acceptable to humans but syntactic saccharine or syrup serves no
 purpose at all Compare candygrammar

sysfrog sisfrog the PLATO system n Playful variant of
 sysprog which is in turn short for systems programmer

sysadmin sisadmin n Common contraction of system
 admin see admin

sysape sysape n A rather derogatory term for a computer
 operator a play on sysop common at sites that use the banana
 hierarchy of problem complexity see onebanana
 problem

sysop sisop n esp in the BBS world The operator and
 usually the owner of a bulletinboard system A common neophyte
 mistake on FidoNet is to address a message to sysop in an
 international echo thus sending it to hundreds of sysops
 around the world

system n 1 The supervisor program or OS on a computer 2 The
 entire computer system including inputoutput devices the
 supervisor program or OS and possibly other software 3 Any
 largescale program 4 Any method or algorithm 5 System

system mangler n Humorous synonym for system manager poss
 from the fact that one major IBM OS had a root account called
 SYSMANGR Refers specifically to a systems programmer in charge of
 administration software maintenance and updates at some site
 Unlike admin this term emphasizes the technical end of the
 skills involved

SysVile sisvil n See Missedemfive

 T 


T T 1 from LISP terminology for true Yes Used in
 reply to a question particularly one asked using the P
 convention In LISP the constant T means true among other
 things Some hackers use T and NIL instead of Yes and No
 almost reflexively This sometimes causes misunderstandings When
 a waiter or flight attendant asks whether a hacker wants coffee he
 may well respond T meaning that he wants coffee but of course
 he will be brought a cup of tea instead As it happens most
 hackers particularly those who frequent Chinese restaurants like
 tea at least as well as coffee  so it is not that big a problem
 2 See time T also since time T equals minus infinity
 3 techspeak In transactionprocessing circles an abbreviation
 for the noun transaction 4 Purdue Alternate spelling of
 tee 5 A dialect of LISP developed at Yale

tail recursion n If you arent sick of it already see tail
 recursion

talk mode n A feature supported by UNIX ITS and some other
 OSes that allows two or more loggedin users to set up a realtime
 online conversation It combines the immediacy of talking with
 all the precision and verbosity that written language entails
 It is difficult to communicate inflection though conventions have
 arisen for some of these see the section on writing style in the
 Prependices for details

 Talk mode has a special set of jargon words used to save typing
 which are not used orally Some of these are identical to and
 probably derived from Morsecode jargon used by hamradio amateurs
 since the 1920s

 BCNU
 be seeing you
 BTW
 by the way
 BYE
 are you ready to unlink this is the standard way to end a
 talkmode conversation the other person types BYE to
 confirm or else continues the conversation
 CUL
 see you later
 ENQ
 are you busy expects ACK or NAK in return
 FOO
 are you there often used on unexpected links meaning also
 Sorry if I butted in  linker or Whats up linkee
 FYI
 for your information
 FYA
 for your amusement
 GA
 go ahead used when two people have tried to type
 simultaneously this cedes the right to type to the other
 GRMBL
 grumble expresses disquiet or disagreement
 HELLOP

 MIN
 same as JAM
 NIL

 WTF
 the universal interrogative particle WTF knows what it means
 WTH

 double newline
 When the typing party has finished heshe types two newlines
 to signal that heshe is done this leaves a blank line
 between speeches in the conversation making it easier to
 reread the preceding text
 name
 When three or more terminals are linked it is conventional
 for each typist to prepend hisher login name or handle and
 a colon or a hyphen to each line to indicate who is typing
 some conferencing facilities do this automatically The
 login name is often shortened to a unique prefix possibly a
 single letter during a very long conversation
 
 A giggle or chuckle On a MUD this usually means earthquake
 fault

 Most of the above subjargon is used at both Stanford and MIT
 Several of these expressions are also common in email esp
 FYI FYA BTW BCNU WTF and CUL A few other abbreviations have
 been reported from commercial networks such as GEnie and
 CompuServe where online live chat including more than two
 people is common and usually involves a more social context
 notably the following

 g
 grin
 grd
 grinning running and ducking
 BBL

 Most of these are not used at universities or in the UNIX world
 though ROTF and TTFN have gained some currency there and IMHO is
 common conversely most of the people who know these are
 unfamiliar with FOO BCNU HELLOP NIL and T

 The MUD community uses a mixture of USENETInternet emoticons
 a few of the more natural of the oldstyle talkmode abbrevs and
 some of the social list above specifically MUD respondents
 report use of BBL BRB LOL b4 BTW WTF TTFN and WTH The use
 of rehi is also common in fact mudders are fond of re
 compounds and will frequently rehug or rebonk see
 bonkoif people The word re by itself is taken as
 regreet In general though MUDders express a preference for
 typing things out in full rather than using abbreviations this may
 be due to the relative youth of the MUD cultures which tend to
 include many touch typists and to assume highspeed links The
 following uses specific to MUDs are reported

 UOK
 are you OK
 THX
 thanks mutant of TNX clearly this comes in batches of 1138
 the Lucasian K
 CU l8er
 see you later mutant of CU l8tr
 OTT
 over the top excessive uncalled for
 FOAD
 fuck off and die use of this is often OTT

 Some BIFFisms notably the variant spelling d00d
 appear to be passing into wider use among some subgroups of
 MUDders

 One final note on talk mode style neophytes when in talk mode
 often seem to think they must produce letterperfect prose because
 they are typing rather than speaking This is not the best
 approach It can be very frustrating to wait while your partner
 pauses to think of a word or repeatedly makes the same spelling
 error and backs up to fix it It is usually best just to leave
 typographical errors behind and plunge forward unless severe
 confusion may result in that case it is often fastest just to type
 xxx and start over from before the mistake

taste primarily MIT n 1 The quality in a program that tends
 to be inversely proportional to the number of features hacks and
 kluges programmed into it Also tasty tasteful
 tastefulness This feature comes in N tasty flavors
 Although tasteful and flavorful are essentially
 synonyms taste and flavor are not Taste refers to
 sound judgment on the part of the creator a program or feature
 can exhibit taste but cannot have taste On the other
 hand a feature can have flavor Also flavor has the
 additional meaning of kind or variety not shared by

tea ISO standard cup of South Africa n A cup of tea with milk
 and one teaspoon of sugar where the milk is poured into the cup
 before the tea Variations are ISO 0 with no sugar ISO 2 with
 two spoons of sugar and so on

 Like many ISO standards this one has a faintly alien ring in North
 America where hackers generally shun the decadent British practice
 of adulterating perfectly good tea with dairy products and
 prefer instead to add a wedge of lemon if anything If one were
 feeling extremely silly one might hypothesize an analogous ANSI
 standard cup of tea and wind up with a political situation
 distressingly similar to several that arise in much more serious
 technical contexts Milk and lemon dont mix very well

TechRef tekref MSDOS n The original IBM PC
 Technical Reference Manual including the BIOS listing and
 complete schematics for the PC The only PC documentation in the

TECO teekoh obs 1 vt Originally to edit using the TECO
 editor in one of its infinite variations see below 2 vtobs
 To edit even when TECO is not the editor being used This
 usage is rare and now primarily historical 2 originally an
 acronym for paper Tape Editor and COrrector later Text
 Editor and COrrector n A text editor developed at MIT and
 modified by just about everybody With all the dialects included
 TECO might have been the most prolific editor in use before
 EMACS to which it was directly ancestral Noted for its
 powerful programminglanguagelike features and its unspeakably
 hairy syntax It is literally the case that every string of
 characters is a valid TECO program though probably not a useful
 one one common hacker game used to be mentally working out what
 the TECO commands corresponding to human names did As an example
 of TECOs obscurity here is a TECO program that takes a list of
 names such as

 Loser J Random
 Quux The Great
 Dick Moby

 sorts them alphabetically according to surname and then puts the
 surname last removing the comma to produce the following

 Moby Dick
 J Random Loser
 The Great Quux

 The program is

 1 JPL
 J Z S D FX1 FB K L I  G1 L

 where B means ControlB ASCII 0000010 and  is actually
 an alt or escape ASCII 0011011 character

 In fact this very program was used to produce the second sorted
 list from the first list The first hack at it had a bug GLS
 the author had accidentally omitted the  in front
 of FB which as anyone can see is clearly the Wrong Thing It
 worked fine the second time There is no space to describe all the
 features of TECO but it may be of interest that P means
 sort and JZ  L is an idiomatic series of commands
 for do once for every line

 In mid1991 TECO is pretty much one with the dust of history
 having been replaced in the affections of hackerdom by EMACS
 Descendants of an early and somewhat lobotomized version adopted
 by DEC can still be found lurking on VMS and a couple of crufty
 PDP11 operating systems however and ports of the more advanced
 MIT versions remain the focus of some antiquarian interest See
 also retrocomputing writeonly language

tenfinger interface n The interface between two networks that
 cannot be directly connected for security reasons refers to the
 practice of placing two terminals side by side and having an

 console jockey seems to imply more expertise than the other
 three possibly because of the exalted status of the console
 relative to an ordinary terminal See also twink

terpri terpree from LISP 15 and later MacLISP vi To
 output a newline Now rare as jargon though still used as
 techspeak in Common LISP It is a contraction of TERminate PRInt
 line named for the fact that on some early OSes and hardware no
 characters would be printed until a complete line was formed so
 this operation terminated the line and emitted the output

TeX tekh n An extremely powerful macrobased
 text formatter written by Donald E Knuth very popular in the
 computerscience community it is good enough to have displaced
 UNIX troff1 the other favored formatter even at many
 UNIX installations TeX fans insist on the correct guttural
 pronunciation and the correct spelling all caps squished
 together with the E depressed below the baseline the
 mixedcase TeX is considered an acceptable kluge on ASCIIonly
 devices Fans like to proliferate names from the word TeX
  such as TeXnician TeX user TeXhacker TeX
 programmer TeXmaster competent TeX programmer TeXhax
 and TeXnique

 Knuth began TeX because he had become annoyed at the declining
 quality of the typesetting in volumes IIII of his monumental
 Art of Computer Programming see Knuth also
 bible In a manifestation of the typical hackish urge to
 solve the problem at hand once and for all he began to design his
 own typesetting language He thought he would finish it on his
 sabbatical in 1978 he was wrong by only about 8 years The
 language was finally frozen around 1985 but volume IV of The
 Art of Computer Programming has yet to appear as of mid1991 The
 impact and influence of TeXs design has been such that nobody
 minds this very much Many grand hackish projects have started as
 a bit of toolbuilding on the way to something else Knuths
 diversion was simply on a grander scale than most

 TeX has also been a noteworthy example of free shared but
 highquality software Knuth used to offer monetary awards to people
 who found and reported bugs in it as the years wore on and the few
 remaining bugs were fixed and new ones even harder to find the
 bribe went up Though wellwritten TeX is so large and so full of
 cutting edge technique that it is said to have unearthed at least
 one bug in every Pascal it has been compiled with

 hackerdoms peculiar attraction to mystical references  a common
 humorous way of making exclusive statements about a class of

thrash vi To move wildly or violently without accomplishing
 anything useful Paging or swapping systems that are overloaded
 waste most of their time moving data into and out of core rather
 than performing useful computation and are therefore said to

 other synonyms

thumb n The slider on a windowsystem scrollbar So called
 because moving it allows you to browse through the contents of a
 text window in a way analogous to thumbing through a book

thunk thuhnk n 1 A piece of coding which provides an
 address according to P Z Ingerman who invented thunks
 in 1961 as a way of binding actual parameters to their formal
 definitions in Algol60 procedure calls If a procedure is called
 with an expression in the place of a formal parameter the compiler
 generates a thunk to compute the expression and leave the
 address of the result in some standard location 2 Later
 generalized into an expression frozen together with its
 environment for later evaluation if and when needed similar to
 what in techspeak is called a closure The process of
 unfreezing these thunks is called forcing 3 A
 stubroutine in an overlay programming environment that loads
 and jumps to the correct overlay Compare trampoline
 4 People and activities scheduled in a thunklike manner It
 occurred to me the other day that I am rather accurately modeled by
 a thunk  I frequently need to be forced to completion 
 paraphrased from a plan file

 Historical note There are a couple of onomatopoeic myths
 circulating about the origin of this term The most common is that
 it is the sound made by data hitting the stack another holds that
 the sound is that of the data hitting an accumulator Yet another
 holds that it is the sound of the expression being unfrozen at
 argumentevaluation time In fact according to the inventors it
 was coined after they realized in the wee hours after hours of
 discussion that the type of an argument in Algol60 could be
 figured out in advance with a little compiletime thought
 simplifying the evaluation machinery In other words it had
 already been thought of thus it was christened a thunk
 which is the past tense of think at two in the morning

tick n 1 A jiffy sense 1 2 In simulations the
 discrete unit of time that passes between iterations of the
 simulation mechanism In AI applications this amount of time is
 often left unspecified since the only constraint of interest is
 the ordering of events This sort of AI simulation is often
 pejoratively referred to as tickticktick simulation
 especially when the issue of simultaneity of events with long
 independent chains of causes is handwaved 3 In the FORTH
 language a single quote character

ticklist features Acorn Computers n Features in software or
 hardware that customers insist on but never use calculators in
 desktop TSRs and that sort of thing The American equivalent
 would be checklist features but this jargon sense of the
 phrase has not been reported

tiger team US military jargon n 1 Originally a team whose
 purpose is to penetrate security and thus test security measures
 These people are paid professionals who do hackertype tricks
 eg leave cardboard signs saying bomb in critical defense
 installations handlettered notes saying Your codebooks have
 been stolen they usually havent been inside safes etc After
 a successful penetration some highranking security type shows up
 the next morning for a security review and finds the sign
 note etc and all hell breaks loose Serious successes of tiger
 teams sometimes lead to early retirement for base commanders and
 security officers see the patch entry for an example
 2 Recently and more generally any official inspection team or
 special firefighting group called in to look at a problem

 A subset of tiger teams are professional crackers testing the
 security of military computer installations by attempting remote
 attacks via networks or supposedly secure comm channels Some of
 their escapades if declassified would probably rank among the

 commercial computersecurity circles in this more specific sense

time sink poss by analogy with heat sink or current sink n

time T tim T n 1 An unspecified but usually wellunderstood
 time often used in conjunction with a later time T1
 Well meet on campus at time T or at Louies at
 time T1 means in the context of going out for dinner
 We can meet on campus and go to Louies or we can meet at Louies
 itself a bit later Louies was a Chinese restaurant in Palo Alto
 that was a favorite with hackers Had the number 30 been used instead
 of the number 1 it would have implied that the travel time from
 campus to Louies is 30 minutes whatever time T is and
 that hasnt been decided on yet you can meet half an hour later at
 Louies than you could on campus and end up eating at the same time
 See also since time T equals minus infinity

timesordividedby by analogy with plusorminus quant
 Term occasionally used when describing the uncertainty associated
 with a scheduling estimate for either humorous or brutally honest
 effect For a software project the scheduling uncertainty factor

tinycrud tineekruhd n 1 A pejorative used by habitues of older
 gameoriented MUD versions for TinyMUDs and other
 userextensible MUD variants esp common among users of the
 rather violent and competitive AberMUD and MIST systems These
 people justify the slur on the basis of how allegedly
 inconsistent and lacking in genuine atmosphere the scenarios
 generated in user extensible MUDs can be Other common knocks on
 them are that they feature little overall plot bad game topology
 little competitive interaction etc  not to mention the alleged
 horrors of the TinyMUD code itself This dispute is one of the MUD

TMRC tmerk n The Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT one of
 the wellsprings of hacker culture The 1959 Dictionary of
 the TMRC Language compiled by Peter Samson included several terms
 which became basics of the hackish vocabulary see esp foo
 and frob

 By 1962 TMRCs legendary layout was already a marvel of complexity
 and has grown in the thirty years since all the features
 described here are still present The control system alone
 featured about 1200 relays There were scram switches located
 at numerous places around the room that could be thwacked if
 something undesirable was about to occur such as a train going
 fullbore at an obstruction Another feature of the system was a
 digital clock on the dispatch board which was itself something of
 a wonder in those bygone days before cheap LEDS and sevensegment
 displays no model railroad can begin to approximate the scale
 distances between towns and stations so model railroad timetables
 assume a fast clock so that it seems to take about the right amount
 of time for a train to complete its journey When someone hit a
 scram switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the
 word FOO at TMRC the scram switches are therefore called foo
 switches

 Steven Levy in his book Hackers see the Bibliography in
 appendix C gives a stimulating account of those early
 years TMRCs Power and Signals group included most of the early
 PDP1 hackers and the people who later bacame the core of the MIT
 AI Lab staff Thirty years later that connection is still very
 much alive and this lexicon accordingly includes a number of
 entries from a recent revision of the TMRC Dictionary

TMRCie tmerkee tuhmerkee MIT n A denizen of TMRC

to a first approximation 1 techspeak When one is doing certain
 numerical computations an approximate solution may be computed by
 any of several heuristic methods then refined to a final value
 By using the starting point of a first approximation of the answer
 one can write an algorithm that converges more quickly to the
 correct result 2 In jargon a preface to any comment that
 indicates that the comment is only approximately true The remark
 To a first approximation I feel good might indicate that
 deeper questioning would reveal that not all is perfect eg a
 nagging cough still remains after an illness

toeprint n A footprint of especially small size

toggle vt To change a bit from whatever state it is in to the
 other state to change from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1 This comes from
 toggle switches such as standard light switches though the
 word toggle actually refers to the mechanism that keeps the
 switch in the position to which it is flipped rather than to the
 fact that the switch has two positions There are four things you
 can do to a bit set it force it to be 1 clear or zero it
 leave it alone or toggle it Mathematically one would say that
 there are four distinct booleanvalued functions of one boolean
 argument but saying that is much less fun than talking about
 toggling bits

 some sort of tenuous analogy with luser this also expresses the
 ITS cultures penchant for sixletterisms Compare twink
 readonly user

tourist information n Information in an online display that is
 not immediately useful but contributes to a viewers gestalt of
 whats going on with the software or hardware behind it Whether a
 given piece of info falls in this category depends partly on what
 the user is looking for at any given time The bytes free
 information at the bottom of an MSDOS dir display is
 tourist information so most of the time is the TIME information

 adequately 2 just a toy A machine that yields
 insufficient computrons for the speakers preferred uses This

 but inadequate for generalpurpose programming Bad Things
 can result when a toy language is promoted as a general purpose
 solution for programming see bondageanddiscipline

trampoline n An incredibly hairy technique found in some
 HLL and programoverlay implementations eg on the
 Macintosh that involves onthefly generation of small executable
 and likely as not selfmodifying code objects to do indirection
 between code sections These pieces of live data are called
 trampolines Trampolines are notoriously difficult to understand
 in action in fact it is said by those who use this term that the
 trampoline that doesnt bend your brain is not the true
 trampoline See also snap

trap 1 n A program interrupt usually an interrupt caused by
 some exceptional situation in the user program In most cases the
 OS performs some action then returns control to the program
 2 vi To cause a trap These instructions trap to the
 monitor Also used transitively to indicate the cause of the
 trap The monitor traps all inputoutput instructions

 This term is associated with assembler programming interrupt
 or exception is more common among HLL programmers and
 appears to be fading into history among programmers as the role of
 assembler continues to shrink However it is still important to
 computer architects and systems hackers see system
 sense 1 who use it to distinguish deterministically repeatable
 exceptions from timingdependent ones such as IO interrupts

troff teerof or trof UNIX n The gray eminence of UNIX
 text processing a formatting and phototypesetting program written
 originally in PDP11 assembler and then in barelystructured early
 C by the late Joseph Ossana modeled after the earlier ROFF which
 was in turn modeled after Multics RUNOFF A companion program
 nroff formats output for terminals and line printers

 In 1979 Brian Kernighan modified TROFF so that it could drive
 phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT His paper
 describing that work A Typesetterindependent TROFF ATT CSTR
 97 explains troffs durability After discussing the
 programs obvious deficiencies  a rebarbative input syntax
 mysterious and undocumented properties in some areas and a
 voracious appetite for computer resources and noting the ugliness
 and extreme hairiness of the code and internals Kernighan
 concludes

 None of these remarks should be taken as denigrating
 Ossanas accomplishment with TROFF It has proven a
 remarkably robust tool taking unbelievable abuse from a
 variety of preprocessors and being forced into uses that
 were never conceived of in the original design all with
 considerable grace under fire

 The success of TeX and desktop publishing systems have reduced
 troffs relative importance but this tribute perfectly
 captures the strengths that secured troff a place in hacker
 folklore indeed it could be taken more generally as an indication
 of those qualities of good programs which in the long run hackers
 most admire

troglodyte Commodore n 1 A hacker who never leaves his

tunafish n In hackish lore refers to the mutated punchline of
 an ageold joke to be found at the bottom of the manual pages of
 tunefs8 in the original BSD 42 distribution The
 joke was removed in later releases once commercial sites started
 using 42 Tunefs relates to the tuning of filesystem
 parameters for optimum performance and at the bottom of a few
 pages of wizardly inscriptions was a BUGS section consisting of
 the line You can tune a file system but you cant tunafish
 Variants of this can be seen in other BSD versions though it has
 been excised from some versions by humorless management

Turing tarpit n 1 A place where anything is possible but
 nothing of interest is practical Alan Turing helped lay the
 foundations of computer science by showing that all machines and
 languages capable of expressing a certain very primitive set of
 operations are logically equivalent in the kinds of computations
 they can carry out and in principle have capabilities that differ
 only in speed from those of the most powerful and
 elegantlydesigned computers However no machine or language
 exactly matching Turings primitive set has ever been built other
 than possibly as a classroom exercise because it would be
 horribly slow and far too painful to use A Turing tarpit is
 any computer language or other tool which shares this property
 That is its theoretically universal  but in practice the
 harder you struggle to get any real work done the deeper its
 inadequacies suck you in Compare bondageanddiscipline

TWENEX tweneks n The TOPS20 operating system by DEC 
 the second proprietary OS for the PDP10  preferred by most
 PDP10 hackers over TOPS10 that is by those who were not
 ITS or WAITS partisans TOPS20 began in 1969 as Bolt
 Beranek  Newmans TENEX operating system using special paging
 hardware By the early 1970s almost all of the systems on the
 ARPANET ran TENEX DEC purchased the rights to TENEX from BBN and
 began work to make it their own The first inhouse code name for
 the operating system was VIROS VIRtual memory Operating System
 when customers started asking questions the name was changed to
 SNARK so DEC could truthfully deny that there was any project
 called VIROS When the name SNARK became known the name was
 briefly reversed to become KRANS this was quickly abandoned when
 it was discovered that krans meant funeral wreath in
 Swedish Ultimately DEC picked TOPS20 as the name of the
 operating system and it was as TOPS20 that it was marketed The
 hacker community mindful of its origins quickly dubbed it
 TWENEX a contraction of twenty TENEX even though by this
 point very little of the original TENEX code remained analogously
 to the differences between ATT V6 UNIX and BSD DEC people
 cringed when they heard TWENEX but the term caught on
 nevertheless the written abbreviation 20x was also used
 TWENEX was successful and very popular in fact there was a period
 in the early 1980s when it commanded as fervent a culture of
 partisans as UNIX or ITS  but DECs decision to scrap all the
 internal rivals to the VAX architecture and its relatively stodgy
 VMS OS killed the DEC20 and put a sad end to TWENEXs brief day in
 the sun DEC attempted to convince TOPS20 hackers to convert to
 VMS but instead by the late 1980s most of the TOPS20
 hackers had migrated to UNIX

twiddle n 1 Tilde ASCII 1111110  Also
 called squiggle sqiggle sic  pronounced skigl
 and twaddle but twiddle is the most common term 2 A small
 and insignificant change to a program Usually fixes one bug and
 generates several new ones 3 vt To change something in a small
 way Bits for example are often twiddled Twiddling a switch or
 knob implies much less sense of purpose than toggling or tweaking
 it see frobnicate To speak of twiddling a bit connotes
 aimlessness and at best doesnt specify what youre doing to the
 bit toggling a bit has a more specific meaning see bit

UNIX yooniks In the authors words A weak pun on
 Multics n also Unix An interactive timesharing system
 originally invented in 1969 by Ken Thompson after Bell Labs left
 the Multics project originally so he could play games on his
 scavenged PDP7 Dennis Ritchie the inventor of C is considered
 a coauthor of the system The turning point in UNIXs history
 came when it was reimplemented almost entirely in C during
 19721974 making it the first sourceportable OS UNIX
 subsequently underwent mutations and expansions at the hands of
 many different people resulting in a uniquely flexible and
 developerfriendly environment In 1991 UNIX is the most widely
 used multiuser generalpurpose operating system in the world Many
 people consider this the most important victory yet of hackerdom
 over industry opposition but see UNIX weenie and UNIX
 conspiracy for an opposing point of view See Version 7

UNIX brain damage n Something that has to be done to break a
 network program typically a mailer on a nonUNIX system so that
 it will interoperate with UNIX systems The hack may qualify as
 UNIX brain damage if the program conforms to published standards
 and the UNIX program in question does not UNIX brain damage
 happens because it is much easier for other minority systems to
 change their ways to match nonconforming behavior than it is to
 change all the hundreds of thousands of UNIX systems out there

 An example of UNIX brain damage is a kluge in a mail server to
 recognize bare line feed the UNIX newline as an equivalent form
 to the Internet standard newline which is a carriage return
 followed by a line feed Such things can make even a hardened
 jock weep

UNIX conspiracy ITS n According to a conspiracy theory long
 popular among ITS and TOPS20 fans UNIXs growth is the
 result of a plot hatched during the 1970s at Bell Labs whose
 intent was to hobble ATTs competitors by making them dependent
 upon a system whose future evolution was to be under ATTs
 control This would be accomplished by disseminating an operating
 system that is apparently inexpensive and easily portable but also
 relatively unreliable and insecure so as to require continuing
 upgrades from ATT This theory was lent a substantial impetus
 in 1984 by the paper referenced in the back door entry

 In this view UNIX was designed to be one of the first computer
 viruses see virus  but a virus spread to computers indirectly
 by people and market forces rather than directly through disks and
 networks Adherents of this UNIX virus theory like to cite the
 fact that the wellknown quotation UNIX is snake oil was
 uttered by DEC president Kenneth Olsen shortly before DEC began
 actively promoting its own family of UNIX workstations Olsen now
 claims to have been misquoted

UNIX weenie ITS n 1 A derogatory play on UNIX wizard common
 among hackers who use UNIX by necessity but would prefer
 alternatives The implication is that although the person in question
 may consider mastery of UNIX arcana to be a wizardly skill the
 only real skill involved is the ability to tolerate and the bad
 taste to wallow in the incoherence and needless complexity that is
 alleged to infest many UNIX programs This shell script tries to
 parse its arguments in 69 bletcherous ways It must have been
 written by a real UNIX weenie 2 A derogatory term for anyone
 who engages in uncritical praise of UNIX Often appearing in the
 context stupid UNIX weenie See Weenix UNIX
 conspiracy See also weenie

unixism n A piece of code or a coding technique that depends on the
 protected multitasking environment with relatively low
 processspawn overhead that exists on virtualmemory UNIX systems
 Common unixisms include gratuitous use of fork2 the
 assumption that certain undocumented but wellknown features of
 UNIX libraries such as stdio3 are supported elsewhere
 reliance on obscure sideeffects of system calls use of
 sleep2 with a 0 argument to clue the scheduler that
 youre willing to give up your timeslice for example the
 assumption that freshly allocated memory is zeroed and the assumption
 that fragmentation problems wont arise from never freeing
 memory Compare vaxocentrism see also New Jersey

unroll v To repeat the body of a loop several times in succession
 This optimization technique reduces the number of times the
 looptermination test has to be executed But it only works if
 the number of iterations desired is a multiple of the number of
 repetitions of the body Something has to be done to take care
 of any leftover iterations  such as Duffs device

user n 1 Someone doing real work with the computer using
 it as a means rather than an end Someone who pays to use a
 computer See real user 2 A programmer who will believe
 anything you tell him One who asks silly questions GLS
 observes This is slightly unfair It is true that users ask
 questions of necessity Sometimes they are thoughtful or deep
 Very often they are annoying or downright stupid apparently
 because the user failed to think for two seconds or look in the
 documentation before bothering the maintainer See luser
 3 Someone who uses a program from the outside however skillfully
 without getting into the internals of the program One who reports
 bugs instead of just going ahead and fixing them

 The general theory behind this term is that there are two classes
 of people who work with a program there are implementors hackers
 and lusers The users are looked down on by hackers to some
 extent because they dont understand the full ramifications of the
 system in all its glory The few users who do are known as
 real winners The term is a relative one a skilled hacker
 may be a user with respect to some program he himself does not
 hack A LISP hacker might be one who maintains LISP or one who
 uses LISP but with the skill of a hacker A LISP user is one who
 uses LISP whether skillfully or not Thus there is some overlap
 between the two terms the subtle distinctions must be resolved by
 context

userfriendly adj Programmerhostile Generally used by hackers in
 a critical tone to describe systems that hold the users hand so
 obsessively that they make it painful for the more experienced and
 knowledgeable to get any work done See menuitis droolproof
 paper Macintrash userobsequious

userobsequious adj Emphatic form of userfriendly Connotes
 a system so verbose inflexible and determinedly simpleminded
 that it is nearly unusable Design a system any fool can use and
 only a fool will want to use it See WIMP environment

USG UNIX USG yooniks n Refers to ATT UNIX
 commercial versions after Version 7 especially System III and
 System V releases 1 2 and 3 So called because during most of
 the lifespan of those versions ATTs support crew was called the
 UNIX Support Group See BSD UNIX

UTSL  UNIX n Online acronym for Use the Source Luke a
 pun on ObiWan Kenobis Use the Force Luke in Star
 Wars  analogous to RTFM but more polite This is a
 common way of suggesting that someone would be best off reading the
 source code that supports whatever feature is causing confusion
 rather than making yet another futile pass through the manuals or
 broadcasting questions that havent attracted wizards to
 answer them In theory this is appropriately directed only at
 associates of some outfit with a UNIX source license in practice
 bootlegs of UNIX source code made precisely for reference
 purposes are so ubiquitous that one may utter this at almost
 anyone on the network without concern In the near future
 this written in 1991 source licenses may become even less
 important after the recent release of the Mach 30 microkernel
 given the continuing efforts of the GNU project and with the
 44BSD release on the horizon complete free source code for
 UNIXclone toolsets and kernels should soon be widely available

UUCPNET n The storeandforward network consisting of all the
 worlds connected UNIX machines and others running some clone of
 the UUCP UNIXtoUNIX CoPy software Any machine reachable only
 via a bang path is on UUCPNET See network address

 V 


vadding vading from VAD a permutation of ADV ie
 ADVENT used to avoid a particular admins continual
 searchanddestroy sweeps for the game n A leisuretime activity
 of certain hackers involving the covert exploration of the
 secret parts of large buildings  basements roofs freight
 elevators maintenance crawlways steam tunnels and the like A
 few go so far as to learn locksmithing in order to synthesize
 vadding keys The verb is to vad compare phreaking see
 also hack sense 9 This term dates from the late 1970s
 before which such activity was simply called hacking the older
 usage is still prevalent at MIT

 The most extreme and dangerous form of vadding is elevator
 rodeo aka elevator surfing a sport played by wrasslin
 down a thousandpound elevator car with a 3foot piece of
 string and then exploiting this mastery in various stimulating
 ways such as elevator hopping shaft exploration ratracing and
 the everpopular drop experiments Kids dont try this at home

vanilla from the default flavor of ice cream in the US adj
 Ordinary flavor standard When used of food very often does
 not mean that the food is flavored with vanilla extract For
 example vanilla wonton soup means ordinary wonton soup as
 opposed to hotandsour wonton soup Applied to hardware and
 software as in Vanilla Version 7 UNIX cant run on a
 vanilla 1134 Also used to orthogonalize chip nomenclature for
 instance a 74V00 means what TI calls a 7400 as distinct from
 a 74LS00 etc This word differs from canonical in that the
 latter means default whereas vanilla simply means ordinary
 For example when hackers go on a greatwall hotandsour
 wonton soup is the canonical wonton soup to get because that
 is what most of them usually order even though it isnt the
 vanilla wonton soup

vannevar vanvar n A bogus technological prediction or a
 foredoomed engineering concept esp one that fails by implicitly
 assuming that technologies develop linearly incrementally and in
 isolation from one another when in fact the learning curve tends to
 be highly nonlinear revolutions are common and competition is the
 rule The prototype was Vannevar Bushs prediction of
 electronic brains the size of the Empire State Building with a
 NiagaraFallsequivalent cooling system for their tubes and relays
 made at a time when the semiconductor effect had already been
 demonstrated Other famous vannevars have included magneticbubble

 late 1970s that computed a purported ultimate limit on areal
 density for ICs that was in fact less than the routine densities of
 5 years later

VAX vaks n 1 from Virtual Address eXtension The most
 successful minicomputer design in industry history possibly
 excepting its immediate ancestor the PDP11 Between its release
 in 1978 and its eclipse by killer micros after about 1986 the
 VAX was probably the hackers favorite machine of them all esp
 after the 1982 release of 42 BSD UNIX see BSD Esp
 noted for its large assemblerprogrammerfriendly instruction set
  an asset that became a liability after the RISC revolution
 2 A major brand of vacuum cleaner in Britain Cited here because
 its alleged sales pitch Nothing sucks like a VAX became a
 sort of battlecry of RISC partisans It is sometimes claimed that
 this slogan was not actually used by the Vax vacuumcleaner
 people but was actually that of a rival brand called Electrolux
 as in Nothing sucks like your editors have not yet
 been able to verify either version of the legend It is also
 claimed that DEC actually entered a crosslicensing deal with the
 vacuumVax people that allowed them to market VAX computers in the
 UK in return for not challenging the vacuum cleaner trademark in
 the US

VAXectomy vaksektmee by analogy with vasectomy n A
 VAX removal DECs Microvaxen especially are much slower than

vaxherd n vaksherd from oxherd A VAX operator

vaxism vaksizm n A piece of code that exhibits
 vaxocentrism in critical areas Compare PCism
 unixism

vaxocentrism vaksohsentrizm analogy with
 ethnocentrism n A notional disease said to afflict
 C programmers who persist in coding according to certain
 assumptions that are valid esp under UNIX on VAXen but
 false elsewhere Among these are

 1 The assumption that dereferencing a null pointer is safe because it
 is all bits 0 and location 0 is readable and 0 Problem this may
 instead cause an illegaladdress trap on nonVAXen and even on
 VAXen under OSes other than BSD UNIX Usually this is an implicit
 assumption of sloppy code forgetting to check the pointer before
 using it rather than deliberate exploitation of a misfeature

 2 The assumption that characters are signed

 3 The assumption that a pointer to any one type can freely be cast
 into a pointer to any other type A stronger form of this is the
 assumption that all pointers are the same size and format which
 means you dont have to worry about getting the types correct in
 calls Problem this fails on wordoriented machines or others
 with multiple pointer formats

 4 The assumption that the parameters of a routine are stored in
 memory contiguously and in strictly ascending or descending
 order Problem this fails on many RISC architectures

 5 The assumption that pointer and integer types are the same size
 and that pointers can be stuffed into integer variables and
 viceversa and drawn back out without being truncated or mangled
 Problem this fails on segmented architectures or wordoriented
 machines with funny pointer formats

 6 The assumption that a data type of any size may begin at any byte
 address in memory for example that you can freely construct and
 dereference a pointer to a word or greatersized object at an odd
 char address Problem this fails on many esp RISC
 architectures better optimized for HLL execution speed and can
 cause an illegal address fault or bus error

 7 The related assumption that there is no padding at the end of
 types and that in an array you can thus step right from the last
 byte of a previous component to the first byte of the next one
 This is not only machine but compilerdependent

 8 The assumption that memory address space is globally flat and that
 the array reference foo1 is necessarily valid Problem this
 fails at 0 or other places on segmentaddressed machines like
 Intel chips yes segmentation is universally considered a
 braindamaged way to design machines see moby but that is a
 separate issue

 9 The assumption that objects can be arbitrarily large with no
 special considerations Problem this fails on segmented
 architectures and under nonvirtualaddressing environments

 10 The assumption that the stack can be as large as memory Problem
 this fails on segmented architectures or almost anything else
 without virtual addressing and a paged stack

 11 The assumption that bits and addressable units within an object are
 ordered in the same way and that this order is a constant of
 nature Problem this fails on bigendian machines

 12 The assumption that it is meaningful to compare pointers to
 different objects not located within the same array or to objects
 of different types Problem the former fails on segmented
 architectures the latter on wordoriented machines or others with
 multiple pointer formats

 13 The assumption that an int is 32 bits or nearly equivalently
 the assumption that sizeofint  sizeoflong Problem this
 fails on PDP11s 286based systems and even on 386 and 68000
 systems under some compilers

 14 The assumption that argv is writable Problem this fails in
 many embeddedsystems C environments and even under a few flavors
 of UNIX

 Note that a programmer can validly be accused of vaxocentrism
 even if he or she has never seen a VAX Some of these assumptions
 esp 25 were valid on the PDP11 the original C machine and
 became endemic years before the VAX The terms vaxocentricity
 and alltheworldsaVAX syndrome have been used synonymously

vdiff veedif vn Visual diff The operation of finding
 differences between two files by eyeball search The term
 optical diff has also been reported and is sometimes more
 specifically used for the act of superimposing two nearly identical
 printouts on one another and holding them up to a light to spot
 differences Though this method is poor for detecting omissions in
 the rear file it can also be used with printouts of graphics a
 claim few if any diff programs can make See diff

verbage verbj n A deliberate misspelling and mispronunciation of
 verbiage that assimilates it to the word garbage Compare
 contentfree More pejorative than verbiage

verbiage n When the context involves a software or hardware
 system this refers to documentation This term borrows the
 connotations of mainstream verbiage to suggest that the
 documentation is of marginal utility and that the motives behind
 its production have little to do with the ostensible subject

Version 7 alt V7 vee sevn n The 1978 unsupported release of
 UNIX ancestral to all current commercial versions Before
 the release of the POSIXSVID standards V7s features were often
 treated as a UNIX portability baseline See BSD USG UNIX

 kernel bloat still maintain that V7 was the Last True UNIX

vgrep veegrep vn Visual grep The operation of finding
 patterns in a file optically rather than digitally also called an
 optical grep See grep compare vdiff

vi VI not vi and never siks from
 Visual Interface n A screen editor crufted together by Bill Joy
 for an early BSD release Became the de facto standard
 UNIX editor and a nearly undisputed hacker favorite outside of MIT
 until the rise of EMACS after about 1984 Tends to frustrate
 new users no end as it will neither take commands while expecting
 input text nor vice versa and the default setup provides no
 indication of which mode one is in one correspondent accordingly
 reports that he has often heard the editors name pronounced
 vil Nevertheless it is still widely used about half the
 respondents in a 1991 USENET poll preferred it and even EMACS
 fans often resort to it as a mail editor and for small editing jobs
 mainly because it starts up faster than the bulkier versions of
 EMACS See holy wars

videotex n obs An electronic service offering people the
 privilege of paying to read the weather on their television screens
 instead of having somebody read it to them for free while they
 brush their teeth The idea bombed everywhere it wasnt
 governmentsubsidized because by the time videotex was practical
 the installed base of personal computers could hook up to
 timesharing services and do the things for which videotex might
 have been worthwhile better and cheaper Videotex planners badly
 overestimated both the appeal of getting information from a
 computer and the cost of local intelligence at the users end
 Like the gorilla arm effect this has been a cautionary tale
 to hackers ever since See also vannevar

virgin adj Unused pristine in a known initial state Lets
 bring up a virgin system and see if it crashes again Esp
 useful after contracting a virus through SEX Also by

virtual via the technical term virtual memory prob from
 the term virtual image in optics adj 1 Common alternative
 to logical often used to refer to the artificial objects
 created by a computer system to help the system control access to
 shared resources 2 Simulated performing the functions of
 something that isnt really there An imaginative childs doll may
 be a virtual playmate Oppose real

virtual Friday n The last day before an extended weekend if
 that day is not a real Friday For example the US holiday
 Thanksgiving is always on a Thursday The next day is often also a
 holiday or taken as an extra day off in which case Wednesday of
 that week is a virtual Friday and Thursday is a virtual Saturday
 as is Friday There are also virtual Mondays that are
 actually Tuesdays after the threeday weekends associated with
 many national holidays in the US

virtual reality n 1 Computer simulations that use 3D graphics
 and devices such as the Dataglove to allow the user to interact
 with the simulation See cyberspace 2 A form of network
 interaction incorporating aspects of roleplaying games
 interactive theater improvisational comedy and true confessions
 magazines In a virtual reality forum such as USENETs
 altcallahans newsgroup or the MUD experiments on Internet
 interaction between the participants is written like a shared novel
 complete with scenery foreground characters that may be
 personae utterly unlike the people who write them and common
 background characters manipulable by all parties The one
 iron law is that you may not write irreversible changes to a
 character without the consent of the person who owns it
 Otherwise anything goes See bamf cyberspace

virus from the obvious analogy with biological viruses via SF
 n A cracker program that searches out other programs and infects
 them by embedding a copy of itself in them so that they become
 Trojan Horses When these programs are executed the embedded
 virus is executed too thus propagating the infection This
 normally happens invisibly to the user Unlike a worm a
 virus cannot infect other computers without assistance It is
 propagated by vectors such as humans trading programs with their
 friends see SEX The virus may do nothing but propagate
 itself and then allow the program to run normally Usually
 however after propagating silently for a while it starts doing
 things like writing cute messages on the terminal or playing
 strange tricks with your display some viruses include nice
 display hacks Many nasty viruses written by particularly
 perversely minded crackers do irreversible damage like
 nuking all the users files

 In the 1990s viruses have become a serious problem especially
 among IBM PC and Macintosh users the lack of security on these
 machines enables viruses to spread easily even infecting the
 operating system The production of special antivirus software
 has become an industry and a number of exaggerated media reports
 have caused outbreaks of near hysteria among users many
 lusers tend to blame everything that doesnt work as
 they had expected on virus attacks Accordingly this sense of
 virus has passed not only into techspeak but into also popular
 usage where it is often incorrectly used to denote a worm or
 even a Trojan horse Compare back door see also
 UNIX conspiracy

visionary n 1 One who hacks vision in the sense of an
 Artificial Intelligence researcher working on the problem of
 getting computers to see things using TV cameras There isnt
 any problem in sending information from a TV camera to a computer

 penchant is viewed with awe and wonder

VMS VMS n DECs proprietary operating system for its VAX
 minicomputer one of the seven or so environments that loom largest
 in hacker folklore Many UNIX fans generously concede that VMS
 would probably be the hackers favorite commercial OS if UNIX
 didnt exist though true this makes VMS fans furious One major
 hacker gripe with VMS concerns its slowness  thus the following
 limerick

 There once was a system called VMS
 Of cycles by no means abstemious
 Its chockfull of hacks
 And runs on a VAX
 And makes my poor stomach all squeamious

wabbit wabit almost certainly from Elmer Fudds immortal
 line You wascawwy wabbit n 1 A legendary early hack

WAITS wayts n The mutant cousin of TOPS10 used on a
 handful of systems at SAIL up to 1990 There was never an
 official expansion of WAITS the name itself having been arrived
 at by a rather sideways process but it was frequently glossed as
 Westcoast Alternative to ITS Though WAITS was less visible
 than ITS there was frequent exchange of people and ideas between
 the two communities and innovations pioneered at WAITS exerted
 enormous indirect influence The early screen modes of EMACS
 for example were directly inspired by WAITSs E editor  one
 of a family of editors that were the first to do realtime
 editing in which the editing commands were invisible and where
 one typed text at the point of insertionoverwriting The modern
 style of multiregion windowing is said to have originated there
 and WAITS alumni at XEROX PARC and elsewhere played major roles in
 the developments that led to the XEROX Star the Macintosh and the
 Sun workstations Bucky bits were also invented there 
 thus the ALT key on every IBM PC is a WAITS legacy One notable
 WAITS feature seldom duplicated elsewhere was a newswire interface
 that allowed WAITS hackers to read store and filter AP and UPI
 dispatches from their terminals the system also featured a
 stillunusual level of support for what is now called multimedia
 computing allowing analog audio and video signals to be switched
 to programming terminals

waldo woldoh From Robert A Heinleins story Waldo
 1 A mechanical agent such as a gripper arm controlled by a human
 limb When these were developed for the nuclear industry in the
 mid1940s they were named after the invention described by Heinlein
 in the story which he wrote in 1942 Now known by the more
 generic term telefactoring this technology is of intense
 interest to NASA for tasks like space station maintenance 2 At
 Harvard particularly by Tom Cheatham and students this is used
 instead of foobar as a metasyntactic variable and general
 nonsense word See foo bar foobar quux

walk nvt Traversal of a data structure especially an array or
 linkedlist data structure in core See also codewalker
 silly walk clobber

walk off the end of vt To run past the end of an array list or
 medium after stepping through it  a good way to land in trouble
 Often the result of an offbyone error Compare
 clobber roach smash the stack

walking drives n An occasional failure mode of magneticdisk
 drives back in the days when they were huge clunky washing
 machines Those old dinosaur parts carried terrific angular
 momentum the combination of a misaligned spindle or worn bearings
 and stickslip interactions with the floor could cause them to
 walk across a room lurching alternate corners forward a couple
 of millimeters at a time There is a legend about a drive that
 walked over to the only door to the computer room and jammed it
 shut the staff had to cut a hole in the wall in order to get at
 it Walking could also be induced by certain patterns of drive
 access a fast seek across the whole width of the disk followed by
 a slow seek in the other direction Some bands of oldtime
 hackers figured out how to induce diskaccessing patterns that
 would do this to particular drive models and held diskdrive races

wall WPI interj 1 An indication of confusion usually spoken
 with a quizzical tone Wall 2 A request for further
 explication Compare octal forty 3 UNIX v To send a message
 to everyone currently logged in esp with the wall8 utility

 It is said that sense 1 came from the idiom like talking to a
 blank wall It was originally used in situations where after you
 had carefully answered a question the questioner stared at you
 blankly clearly having understood nothing that was explained You
 would then throw out a Hello wall to elicit some sort of
 response from the questioner Later confused questioners began
 voicing Wall themselves

wall follower n A person or algorithm that compensates for lack
 of sophistication or native stupidity by efficiently following some
 simple procedure shown to have been effective in the past Used of
 an algorithm this is not necessarily pejorative it recalls
 Harvey Wallbanger the winning robot in an early AI contest
 named of course after the cocktail Harvey successfully solved
 mazes by keeping a finger on one wall and running till it came
 out the other end This was inelegant but it was mathematically
 guaranteed to work on simplyconnected mazes  and in fact
 Harvey outperformed more sophisticated robots that tried to
 learn each maze by building an internal representation of it
 Used of humans the term is pejorative and implies an
 uncreative bureaucratic bythebook mentality See also code
 grinder droid

wall time n also wall clock time 1 Real world time what
 the clock on the wall shows as opposed to the system clocks idea
 of time 2 The real running time of a program as opposed to the
 number of clocks required to execute it on a timesharing
 system these will differ as no one program gets all the
 clocks and on multiprocessor systems with good thread support
 one may get more processor clocks than realtime clocks

wallpaper n 1 A file containing a listing eg assembly
 listing or a transcript esp a file containing a transcript of
 all or part of a login session The idea was that the paper for
 such listings was essentially good only for wallpaper as evidenced
 at Stanford where it was used to cover windows Now rare
 esp since other systems have developed other terms for it eg
 PHOTO on TWENEX However the UNIX world doesnt have an
 equivalent term so perhaps wallpaper will take hold there
 The term probably originated on ITS where the commands to begin
 and end transcript files were WALBEG and WALEND
 with default file WALL PAPER the space was a path
 delimiter 2 The background pattern used on graphical
 workstations this is techspeak under the Windows graphical user
 interface to MSDOS 3 wallpaper file n The file that
 contains the wallpaper information before it is actually printed on
 paper Even if you dont intend ever to produce a real paper copy
 of the file it is still called a wallpaper file

wango wanggoh n Random bitlevel grovelling going on in
 a system during some unspecified operation Often used in
 combination with mumble For example You start with the o
 file run it through this postprocessor that does mumblewango 
 and it comes out a snazzy objectoriented executable

wank wangk Columbia University prob by mutation from
 Commonwealth slang v wank to masturbate nv Used much as
 hack is elsewhere as a noun denoting a clever technique or
 person or the result of such cleverness May describe negatively
 the act of hacking for hackings sake Quit wanking lets go get
 supper or more positively a wizard Adj wanky
 describes something particularly clever a person program or
 algorithm Conversations can also get wanky when there are too
 many wanks involved This excess wankiness is signalled by an
 overload of the wankometer compare bogometer When the
 wankometer overloads the conversations subject must be changed
 or all nonwanks will leave Compare neepneeping under
 neepneep Usage US only In Britain and the Commonwealth
 this word is extremely rude and is best avoided unless one
 intends to give offense

wannabee wonbee also more plausibly spelled
 wannabe from a term recently used to describe Madonna fans
 who dress talk and act like their idol prob originally from
 biker slang n A wouldbe hacker The connotations of this
 term differ sharply depending on the age and exposure of the
 subject Used of a person who is in or might be entering
 larval stage it is semiapproving such wannabees can be
 annoying but most hackers remember that they too were once such
 creatures When used of any professional programmer CS academic
 writer or suit it is derogatory implying that said person
 is trying to cuddle up to the hacker mystique but doesnt
 fundamentally have a prayer of understanding what it is all about
 Overuse of terms from this lexicon is often an indication of the
 wannabee nature Compare newbie

 Historical note The wannabee phenomenon has a slightly different
 flavor now 1991 than it did ten or fifteen years ago When the
 people who are now hackerdoms tribal elders were in larval
 stage the process of becoming a hacker was largely unconscious
 and unaffected by models known in popular culture  communities
 formed spontaneously around people who as individuals felt
 irresistibly drawn to do hackerly things and what wannabees
 experienced was a fairly pure skillfocused desire to become
 similarly wizardly Those days of innocence are gone forever
 societys adaptation to the advent of the microcomputer after 1980
 included the elevation of the hacker as a new kind of folk hero
 and the result is that some people semiconsciously set out to
 be hackers and borrow hackish prestige by fitting the
 popular image of hackers Fortunately to do this really well one
 has to actually become a wizard Nevertheless oldtime hackers
 tend to share a poorly articulated disquiet about the change among
 other things it gives them mixed feelings about the effects of
 public compendia of lore like this one

warlording from the USENET group altfanwarlord v The act
 of excoriating a bloated ugly or derivative sig block
 Common grounds for warlording include the presence of a signature
 rendered in a BUAF overused or cliched sig quotes ugly
 ASCII art or simply excessive size The original Warlord
 was a BIFFlike newbie c1991 who featured in his sig a
 particularly large and obnoxious ASCII graphic resembling the sword
 of Conan the Barbarian in the 1981 John Milius movie the group
 name altfanwarlord was sarcasm and the characteristic mode
 of warlording is devastatingly sarcastic praise

warm boot n See boot

weenie n 1 on BBSes Any of a species of luser resembling a
 less amusing version of BIFF that infests many BBS
 systems The typical weenie is a teenage boy with poor social

 flamage weenies tend to spew all over a newlydiscovered BBS
 Compare spod computer geek terminal junkie
 2 Among hackers When used with a qualifier for example as in
 UNIX weenie VMS weenie IBM weenie this can be either an
 insult or a term of praise depending on context tone of voice
 and whether or not it is applied by a person who considers him or
 herself to be the same sort of weenie Implies that the weenie has
 put a major investment of time effort and concentration into the
 area indicated whether this is positive or negative depends on the

Weenix weeniks ITS n A derogatory term for UNIX
 derived from UNIX weenie According to one noted exITSer it
 is the operating system preferred by Unix Weenies typified by
 poor modularity poor reliability hard file deletion no file
 version numbers case sensitivity everywhere and users who believe
 that these are all advantages Some ITS fans behave as though
 they believe UNIX stole a future that rightfully belonged to them
 See ITS sense 2

wellbehaved adj 1 primarily MSDOS Said of software
 conforming to system interface guidelines and standards
 Wellbehaved software uses the operating system to do chores such
 as keyboard input allocating memory and drawing graphics Oppose
 illbehaved 2 Software that does its job quietly and
 without counterintuitive effects Esp said of software having
 an interface spec sufficiently simple and welldefined that it can
 be used as a tool by other software See cat

wellconnected adj Said of a computer installation this means
 that it has reliable email links with the network andor that
 it relays a large fraction of available USENET newsgroups
 Wellknown can be almost synonymous but also implies that the

whack v According to archhacker James Gosling to modify a
 program with no idea whatsoever how it works See whacker
 It is actually possible to do this in nontrivial circumstances if
 the change is small and welldefined and you are very good at
 glarking things from context As a trivial example it is
 relatively easy to change all stderr writes to stdout
 writes in a piece of C filter code which remains otherwise
 mysterious

whacker University of Maryland from hacker n 1 A person
 similar to a hacker who enjoys exploring the details of
 programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities
 Whereas a hacker tends to produce great hacks a whacker only ends
 up whacking the system or program in question Whackers are often

 regardless of the views of their peers 2 A person who is good at
 programming quickly though rather poorly and ineptly

writeonly memory n The obvious antonym to readonly
 memory Out of frustration with the long and seemingly useless
 chain of approvals required of component specifications during
 which no actual checking seemed to occur an engineer at Signetics
 once created a specification for a writeonly memory and included
 it with a bunch of other specifications to be approved This
 inclusion came to the attention of Signetics management only
 when regular customers started calling and asking for pricing
 information Signetics published a corrected edition of the data
 book and requested the return of the erroneous ones Later
 around 1974 Signetics bought a doublepage spread in Electronics
 magazines April issue and used the spec as an April Fools Day

WYSIAYG wizeeayg adj Describes a user interface under
 which What You See Is All You Get an unhappy variant of
 WYSIWYG Visual pointandshootstyle interfaces tend to
 have easy initial learning curves but also to lack depth they
 often frustrate advanced users who would be better served by a
 commandstyle interface When this happens the frustrated user
 has a WYSIAYG problem This term is most often used of editors
 word processors and document formatting programs WYSIWYG
 desktop publishing programs for example are a clear win for
 creating small documents with lots of fonts and graphics in them
 especially things like newsletters and presentation slides When
 typesetting booklength manuscripts on the other hand scale
 changes the nature of the task one quickly runs into WYSIAYG
 limitations and the increased power and flexibility of a
 commanddriven formatter like TeX or UNIXs troff1 becomes
 not just desirable but a necessity

WYSIWYG wizeewig adj Describes a user interface under
 which What You See Is What You Get as opposed to one that uses
 moreorless obscure commands which do not result in immediate

 fonts or graphics is a a rarelyattained ideal there are variants
 of this term to express realworld manifestations including
 WYSIAWYG What You See Is Almost What You Get and
 WYSIMOLWYG What You See Is More or Less What You Get All these
 can be mildly derogatory as they are often used to refer to
 dumbeddown userfriendly interfaces targeted at
 nonprogrammers a hacker has no fear of obscure commands compare

You are not expected to understand this cav UNIX The canonical
 comment describing something magic or too complicated to
 bother explaining properly From an infamous comment in the
 contextswitching code of the V6 UNIX kernel

You know youve been hacking too long when The setup line
 for a genre of oneliners told by hackers about themselves These
 include the following

  not only do you check your email more often than your paper
 mail but you remember your network address faster than your
 postal one
  your SO kisses you on the neck and the first thing you
 think is Uh oh priority interrupt
  you go to balance your checkbook and discover that youre
 doing it in octal
  your computers have a higher street value than your car
  in your universe round numbers are powers of 2 not 10
  more than once you have woken up recalling a dream in
 some programming language
  you realize you have never seen half of your best friends

 An early version of this entry said All but one of these
 have been reliably reported as hacker traits some of them quite
 often Even hackers may have trouble spotting the ringer The
 ringer was balancing ones checkbook in octal which I made up out
 of whole cloth Although more respondents picked that one
 out as fiction than any of the others I also received multiple
 independent reports of its actually happening  ESR

 count in this way

 Hackers and computer scientists often like to call the first
 chapter of a publication chapter 0 especially if it is of an
 introductory nature one of the classic instances was in the First

oid from android suff 1 This suffix is used as in
 mainstream English to indicate a poor imitation a counterfeit or
 some otherwise slightly bogus resemblance Hackers will happily
 use it with all sorts of nonGrecoLatin stem words that wouldnt
 keep company with it in mainstream English For example Hes a
 nerdoid means that he superficially resembles a nerd but cant
 make the grade a modemoid might be a 300baud box Real Modems
 run at 9600 a computeroid might be any bitty box The
 word keyboid could be used to describe a chiclet keyboard
 but would have to be written spoken it would confuse the listener
 as to the speakers city of origin 2 There is a more specific
 sense of oid as an indicator for resembling an android
 which in the past has been confined to sciencefiction fans and
 hackers It too has recently in 1991 started to go mainstream
 most notably in the term trendoid for victims of terminal
 hipness This is probably traceable to the popularization of the
 term droid in Star Wars and its sequels

 Coinages in both forms have been common in science fiction for at
 least fifty years and hackers who are often SF fans have
 probably been making oid jargon for almost that long
 though GLS and I can personally confirm only that they were
 already common in the mid1970s  ESR

0 Numeric zero as opposed to O the 15th letter of the English
 alphabet In their unmodified forms they look a lot alike and
 various kluges invented to make them visually distinct have
 compounded the confusion If your zero is centerdotted and
 letterO is not or if letterO looks almost rectangular but zero
 more like an American football stood on end youre probably
 looking at a modern character display though the dotted zero seems
 to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 controllers If your
 zero is slashed but letterO is not youre probably looking at an
 oldstyle ASCII graphic set descended from the default typewheel on
 the venerable ASR33 Teletype Scandinavians for whom slashedO is
 a letter curse this arrangement If letterO has a slash across
 it and the zero does not your display is tuned for a very old
 convention used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers
 Scandinavians curse this arrangement even more because it
 means two of their letters collide Some BurroughsUnisys
 equipment displays a zero with a reversed slash And yet
 another convention common on early line printers left zero
 unornamented but added a tail or hook to the letterO so that it
 resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letterO Are we
 sufficiently confused yet

Appendix A Hacker Folklore


This appendix contains several legends and fables that illuminate the
meaning of various entries in the lexicon

The Meaning of Hack


The word hack doesnt really have 69 different meanings according
to MIT hacker Phil Agre In fact hack has only one meaning an
extremely subtle and profound one which defies articulation Which
connotation is implied by a given use of the word depends in similarly
profound ways on the context Similar remarks apply to a couple of
other hacker words most notably random

Hacking might be characterized as an appropriate application of
ingenuity Whether the result is a quickanddirty patchwork job or a
carefully crafted work of art you have to admire the cleverness that
went into it

An important secondary meaning of hack is a creative practical joke
This kind of hack is easier to explain to nonhackers than the
programming kind Of course some hacks have both natures see the
lexicon entries for pseudo and kgbvax But here are some examples
of pure practical jokes that illustrate the hacking spirit

 In 1961 students from Caltech California Institute of Technology
 in Pasadena hacked the Rose Bowl football game One student posed
 as a reporter and interviewed the director of the University of
 Washington card stunts such stunts involve people in the stands
 who hold up colored cards to make pictures The reporter learned
 exactly how the stunts were operated and also that the director
 would be out to dinner later

 While the director was eating the students who called themselves
 the Fiendish Fourteen picked a lock and stole a blank direction
 sheet for the card stunts They then had a printer run off 2300
 copies of the blank The next day they picked the lock again and
 stole the master plans for the stunts  large sheets of graph
 paper colored in with the stunt pictures Using these as a guide
 they made new instructions for three of the stunts on the
 duplicated blanks Finally they broke in once more replacing the
 stolen master plans and substituting the stack of diddled
 instruction sheets for the original set

 The result was that three of the pictures were totally different
 Instead of WASHINGTON the word CALTECH was flashed Another
 stunt showed the word HUSKIES the Washington nickname but
 spelled it backwards And what was supposed to have been a picture
 of a husky instead showed a beaver Both Caltech and MIT use the
 beaver  natures engineer  as a mascot

 After the game the Washington faculty athletic representative
 said Some thought it ingenious others were indignant The
 Washington student body president remarked No hard feelings but
 at the time it was unbelievable We were amazed

This is now considered a classic hack particularly because revising the
direction sheets constituted a form of programming

Here is another classic hack

 On November 20 1982 MIT hacked the HarvardYale football game
 Just after Harvards second touchdown against Yale in the first
 quarter a small black ball popped up out of the ground at the
 40yard line and grew bigger and bigger and bigger The letters
 MIT appeared all over the ball As the players and officials
 stood around gawking the ball grew to six feet in diameter and
 then burst with a bang and a cloud of white smoke

 The Boston Globe later reported If you want to know the truth
 MIT won The Game

 The prank had taken weeks of careful planning by members of MITs
 Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity The device consisted of a weather
 balloon a hydraulic ram powered by Freon gas to lift it out of the
 ground and a vacuumcleaner motor to inflate it They made eight
 separate expeditions to Harvard Stadium between 1 and 5 AM
 locating an unused 110volt circuit in the stadium and running
 buried wires from the stadium circuit to the 40yard line where
 they buried the balloon device When the time came to activate the
 device two fraternity members had merely to flip a circuit breaker
 and push a plug into an outlet

 This stunt had all the earmarks of a perfect hack surprise
 publicity the ingenious use of technology safety and
 harmlessness The use of manual control allowed the prank to be
 timed so as not to disrupt the game it was set off between plays
 so the outcome of the game would not be unduly affected The
 perpetrators had even thoughtfully attached a note to the balloon
 explaining that the device was not dangerous and contained no
 explosives

 Harvard president Derek Bok commented They have an awful lot of
 clever people down there at MIT and they did it again President
 Paul E Gray of MIT said There is absolutely no truth to the
 rumor that I had anything to do with it but I wish there were

The hacks above are verifiable history they can be proved to have
happened Many other classichack stories from MIT and elsewhere
though retold as history have the characteristics of what Jan Brunvand
has called urban folklore see FOAF Perhaps the best known of
these is the legend of the infamous trolleycar hack an alleged
incident in which engineering students are said to have welded a trolley
car to its tracks with thermite Numerous versions of this have been
recorded from the 1940s to the present most set at MIT but at least one
very detailed version set at CMU

Brian Leibowitz has researched MIT hacks both real and mythical
extensively the interested reader is referred to his delightful
pictorial compendium The Journal of the Institute for Hacks
Tomfoolery and Pranks MIT Museum 1990 ISBN 0917027035

Finally here is a story about one of the classic computer hacks

 Back in the mid1970s several of the system support staff at
 Motorola discovered a relatively simple way to crack system
 security on the Xerox CPV timesharing system Through a simple
 programming strategy it was possible for a user program to trick
 the system into running a portion of the program in master mode
 supervisor state in which memory protection does not apply The
 program could then poke a large value into its privilege level
 byte normally writeprotected and could then proceed to bypass
 all levels of security within the filemanagement system patch the
 system monitor and do numerous other interesting things In
 short the barn door was wide open

 Motorola quite properly reported this problem to Xerox via an
 official level 1 SIDR a bug report with an intended urgency of
 needs to be fixed yesterday Because the text of each SIDR was
 entered into a database that could be viewed by quite a number of
 people Motorola followed the approved procedure they simply
 reported the problem as Security SIDR and attached all of the
 necessary documentation waystoreproduce etc

 The CPV people at Xerox sat on their thumbs they either didnt
 realize the severity of the problem or didnt assign the necessary
 operatingsystemstaff resources to develop and distribute an
 official patch

 Months passed The Motorola guys pestered their Xerox
 fieldsupport rep to no avail Finally they decided to take
 direct action to demonstrate to Xerox management just how easily
 the system could be cracked and just how thoroughly the security
 safeguards could be subverted

 They dug around in the operatingsystem listings and devised a
 thoroughly devilish set of patches These patches were then
 incorporated into a pair of programs called Robin Hood and Friar
 Tuck Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were designed to run as ghost
 jobs daemons in UNIX terminology they would use the existing
 loophole to subvert system security install the necessary patches
 and then keep an eye on one anothers statuses in order to keep the
 system operator in effect the superuser from aborting them

 One fine day the system operator on the main CPV software
 development system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of
 unusual phenomena These included the following

  Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the
 middle of a job
  Disk drives would seek back and forth so rapidly that they
 would attempt to walk across the floor see walking drives
  The cardpunch output device would occasionally start up of
 itself and punch a lace card These would usually jam in
 the punch
  The console would print snide and insulting messages from
 Robin Hood to Friar Tuck or vice versa
  The Xerox card reader had two output stackers it could be
 instructed to stack into A stack into B or stack into A
 unless a card was unreadable in which case the bad card was
 placed into stacker B One of the patches installed by the
 ghosts added some code to the cardreader driver after
 reading a card it would flip over to the opposite stacker
 As a result card decks would divide themselves in half when
 they were read leaving the operator to recollate them
 manually

 Naturally the operator called in the operatingsystem developers
 They found the bandit ghost jobs running and Xed them and were
 once again surprised When Robin Hood was Xed the following
 sequence of events took place

 X id1

 id1 Friar Tuck I am under attack Pray save me
 id1 Off aborted

 id2 Fear not friend Robin I shall rout the Sheriff
 of Nottinghams men

 id1 Thank you my good fellow

 Each ghostjob would detect the fact that the other had been
 killed and would start a new copy of the recently slain program
 within a few milliseconds The only way to kill both ghosts was to
 kill them simultaneously very difficult or to deliberately crash
 the system

 Finally the system programmers did the latter  only to find
 that the bandits appeared once again when the system rebooted It
 turned out that these two programs had patched the boottime OS
 image the kernel file in UNIX terms and had added themselves to
 the list of programs that were to be started at boot time

 The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts were finally eradicated when
 the system staff rebooted the system from a clean boottape and
 reinstalled the monitor Not long thereafter Xerox released a
 patch for this problem

 It is alleged that Xerox filed a complaint with Motorolas management
 about the merryprankster actions of the two employees in question
 It is not recorded that any serious disciplinary action was taken
 against either of them

TV Typewriters A Tale of Hackish Ingenuity


Here is a true story about a glass tty One day an MIT hacker was in a
motorcycle accident and broke his leg He had to stay in the hospital
quite a while and got restless because he couldnt hack Two of his
friends therefore took a terminal and a modem for it to the hospital so
that he could use the computer by telephone from his hospital bed

Now this happened some years before the spread of home computers and
computer terminals were not a familiar sight to the average person
When the two friends got to the hospital a guard stopped them and asked
what they were carrying They explained that they wanted to take a
computer terminal to their friend who was a patient

The guard got out his list of things that patients were permitted to
have in their rooms TV radio electric razor typewriter tape player
 no computer terminals Computer terminals werent on the list so
the guard wouldnt let it in Rules are rules you know This guard
was clearly a droid

Fair enough said the two friends and they left again They were
frustrated of course because they knew that the terminal was as
harmless as a TV or anything else on the list which gave them an
idea

The next day they returned and the same thing happened a guard stopped
them and asked what they were carrying They said This is a TV
typewriter The guard was skeptical so they plugged it in and
demonstrated it See You just type on the keyboard and what you type
shows up on the TV screen Now the guard didnt stop to think about
how utterly useless a typewriter would be that didnt produce any paper
copies of what you typed but this was clearly a TV typewriter no doubt
about it So he checked his list A TV is all right a typewriter is
all right  okay take it on in

Historical note Many years ago Popular Electronics published
solderityourself plans for a TV typewriter Despite the essential
uselessness of the device it was an enormously popular project
Steve Ciarcia the man behind Byte magazines Circuit Cellar
feature resurrected this ghost in one of his books of the early
1980s He ascribed its popularity no doubt correctly to the
feeling of power the builder could achieve by being able to decide
himself what would be shown on the TV  ESR

A Story About Magic by GLS


Some years ago I was snooping around in the cabinets that housed the
MIT AI Labs PDP10 and noticed a little switch glued to the frame of
one cabinet It was obviously a homebrew job added by one of the labs
hardware hackers no one knows who

You dont touch an unknown switch on a computer without knowing what it
does because you might crash the computer The switch was labeled in a
most unhelpful way It had two positions and scrawled in pencil on the
metal switch body were the words magic and more magic The switch
was in the more magic position

I called another hacker over to look at it He had never seen the
switch before either Closer examination revealed that the switch had
only one wire running to it The other end of the wire did disappear
into the maze of wires inside the computer but its a basic fact of
electricity that a switch cant do anything unless there are two wires
connected to it This switch had a wire connected on one side and no
wire on its other side

It was clear that this switch was someones idea of a silly joke
Convinced by our reasoning that the switch was inoperative we flipped
it The computer instantly crashed

Imagine our utter astonishment We wrote it off as coincidence but
nevertheless restored the switch to the more magic position before
reviving the computer

A year later I told this story to yet another hacker David Moon as I
recall He clearly doubted my sanity or suspected me of a supernatural
belief in the power of this switch or perhaps thought I was fooling him
with a bogus saga To prove it to him I showed him the very switch
still glued to the cabinet frame with only one wire connected to it
still in the more magic position We scrutinized the switch and its
lone connection and found that the other end of the wire though
connected to the computer wiring was connected to a ground pin That
clearly made the switch doubly useless not only was it electrically
nonoperative but it was connected to a place that couldnt affect
anything anyway So we flipped the switch

The computer promptly crashed

This time we ran for Richard Greenblatt a longtime MIT hacker who was
close at hand He had never noticed the switch before either He
inspected it concluded it was useless got some diagonal cutters and
diked it out We then revived the computer and it has run fine ever
since

We still dont know how the switch crashed the machine There is a
theory that some circuit near the ground pin was marginal and
flipping the switch changed the electrical capacitance enough to upset
the circuit as millionthofasecond pulses went through it But
well never know for sure all we can really say is that the switch
was magic

I still have that switch in my basement Maybe Im silly but I
usually keep it set on more magic

A Selection of AI Koans


These are some of the funniest examples of a genre of jokes told at the
MIT AI Lab about various noted hackers The original koans were
composed by Danny Hillis In reading these it is at least useful to
know that Minsky Sussman and Drescher are AI researchers of note that
Tom Knight was one of the Lisp machines principal designers and that
David Moon wrote much of Lisp machine Lisp

   

 A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the power
off and on

 Knight seeing what the student was doing spoke sternly You cannot
fix a machine by just powercycling it with no understanding of what is
going wrong

 Knight turned the machine off and on

 The machine worked

   

 One day a student came to Moon and said I understand how to make a
better garbage collector We must keep a reference count of the
pointers to each cons

Moon patiently told the student the following story

 One day a student came to Moon and said I understand how to make
 a better garbage collector

Ed note Pure referencecount garbage collectors have problems with
circular structures that point to themselves

   

In the days when Sussman was a novice Minsky once came to him as he sat
hacking at the PDP6

 What are you doing asked Minsky

 I am training a randomly wired neural net to play TicTacToe
Sussman replied

 Why is the net wired randomly asked Minsky

 I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play Sussman
said

 Minsky then shut his eyes

 Why do you close your eyes Sussman asked his teacher

 So that the room will be empty

 At that moment Sussman was enlightened

   

 A disciple of another sect once came to Drescher as he was eating his
morning meal

 I would like to give you this personality test said the outsider
because I want you to be happy

 Drescher took the paper that was offered him and put it into the
toaster saying I wish the toaster to be happy too

OS and JEDGAR


This story says a lot about the the ITS ethos

On the ITS system there was a program that allowed you to see what was
being printed on someone elses terminal It spied on the other guys
output by examining the insides of the monitor system The output spy
program was called OS Throughout the rest of the computer science and
at IBM too OS means operating system but among oldtime ITS hackers
it almost always meant output spy

OS could work because ITS purposely had very little in the way of
protection that prevented one user from trespassing on anothers
areas Fair is fair however There was another program that would
automatically notify you if anyone started to spy on your output It
worked in exactly the same way by looking at the insides of the
operating system to see if anyone else was looking at the insides that
had to do with your output This counterspy program was called JEDGAR
a sixletterism pronounced as two syllables jedgr in honor of the
former head of the FBI

But theres more JEDGAR would ask the user for license to kill If
the user said yes then JEDGAR would actually gun the job of the
luser who was spying Unfortunately people found that this made life
too violent especially when tourists learned about it One of the
systems hackers solved the problem by replacing JEDGAR with another
program that only pretended to do its job It took a long time to do
this because every copy of JEDGAR had to be patched To this day no
one knows how many people never figured out that JEDGAR had been
defanged

The Story of Mel a Real Programmer


This was posted to USENET by its author Ed Nather utastronather on
May 21 1983


 A recent article devoted to the macho side of programming
 made the bald and unvarnished statement

 Real Programmers write in FORTRAN

 Maybe they do now
 in this decadent era of
 Lite beer hand calculators and userfriendly software
 but back in the Good Old Days
 when the term software sounded funny
 and Real Computers were made out of drums and vacuum tubes
 Real Programmers wrote in machine code
 Not FORTRAN Not RATFOR Not even assembly language
 Machine Code
 Raw unadorned inscrutable hexadecimal numbers
 Directly

 Lest a whole new generation of programmers
 grow up in ignorance of this glorious past
 I feel dutybound to describe
 as best I can through the generation gap
 how a Real Programmer wrote code
 Ill call him Mel
 because that was his name

 I first met Mel when I went to work for Royal McBee Computer Corp
 a nowdefunct subsidiary of the typewriter company
 The firm manufactured the LGP30
 a small cheap by the standards of the day
 drummemory computer
 and had just started to manufacture
 the RPC4000 a muchimproved
 bigger better faster  drummemory computer
 Cores cost too much
 and werent here to stay anyway
 Thats why you havent heard of the company or the computer

 I had been hired to write a FORTRAN compiler
 for this new marvel and Mel was my guide to its wonders
 Mel didnt approve of compilers

 If a program cant rewrite its own code
 he asked what good is it

 Mel had written
 in hexadecimal
 the most popular computer program the company owned
 It ran on the LGP30
 and played blackjack with potential customers
 at computer shows
 Its effect was always dramatic
 The LGP30 booth was packed at every show
 and the IBM salesmen stood around
 talking to each other
 Whether or not this actually sold computers
 was a question we never discussed

 Mels job was to rewrite
 the blackjack program for the RPC4000
 Port What does that mean
 The new computer had a oneplusone
 addressing scheme
 in which each machine instruction
 in addition to the operation code
 and the address of the needed operand
 had a second address that indicated where on the revolving drum
 the next instruction was located

 In modern parlance
 every single instruction was followed by a GO TO
 Put that in Pascals pipe and smoke it

 Mel loved the RPC4000
 because he could optimize his code
 that is locate instructions on the drum
 so that just as one finished its job
 the next would be just arriving at the read head
 and available for immediate execution
 There was a program to do that job
 an optimizing assembler
 but Mel refused to use it

 You never know where its going to put things
 he explained so youd have to use separate constants

 It was a long time before I understood that remark
 Since Mel knew the numerical value
 of every operation code
 and assigned his own drum addresses
 every instruction he wrote could also be considered
 a numerical constant
 He could pick up an earlier add instruction say
 and multiply by it
 if it had the right numeric value
 His code was not easy for someone else to modify

 I compared Mels handoptimized programs
 with the same code massaged by the optimizing assembler program
 and Mels always ran faster
 That was because the topdown method of program design
 hadnt been invented yet
 and Mel wouldnt have used it anyway
 He wrote the innermost parts of his program loops first
 so they would get first choice
 of the optimum address locations on the drum
 The optimizing assembler wasnt smart enough to do it that way

 Mel never wrote timedelay loops either
 even when the balky Flexowriter
 required a delay between output characters to work right
 He just located instructions on the drum
 so each successive one was just past the read head
 when it was needed
 the drum had to execute another complete revolution
 to find the next instruction
 He coined an unforgettable term for this procedure
 Although optimum is an absolute term
 like unique it became common verbal practice
 to make it relative
 not quite optimum or less optimum
 or not very optimum
 Mel called the maximum timedelay locations
 the most pessimum

 After he finished the blackjack program
 and got it to run
 Even the initializer is optimized
 he said proudly
 he got a Change Request from the sales department
 The program used an elegant optimized
 random number generator
 to shuffle the cards and deal from the deck
 and some of the salesmen felt it was too fair
 since sometimes the customers lost
 They wanted Mel to modify the program
 so at the setting of a sense switch on the console
 they could change the odds and let the customer win

 Mel balked
 He felt this was patently dishonest
 which it was
 and that it impinged on his personal integrity as a programmer
 which it did
 so he refused to do it
 The Head Salesman talked to Mel
 as did the Big Boss and at the bosss urging
 a few Fellow Programmers
 Mel finally gave in and wrote the code
 but he got the test backwards
 and when the sense switch was turned on
 the program would cheat winning every time
 Mel was delighted with this
 claiming his subconscious was uncontrollably ethical
 and adamantly refused to fix it

 After Mel had left the company for greener pature
 the Big Boss asked me to look at the code
 and see if I could find the test and reverse it
 Somewhat reluctantly I agreed to look
 Tracking Mels code was a real adventure

 I have often felt that programming is an art form
 whose real value can only be appreciated
 by another versed in the same arcane art
 there are lovely gems and brilliant coups
 hidden from human view and admiration sometimes forever
 by the very nature of the process
 You can learn a lot about an individual
 just by reading through his code
 even in hexadecimal
 Mel was I think an unsung genius

 Perhaps my greatest shock came
 when I found an innocent loop that had no test in it
 No test None
 Common sense said it had to be a closed loop
 where the program would circle forever endlessly
 Program control passed right through it however
 and safely out the other side
 It took me two weeks to figure it out

 The RPC4000 computer had a really modern facility
 called an index register
 It allowed the programmer to write a program loop
 that used an indexed instruction inside
 each time through
 the number in the index register
 was added to the address of that instruction
 so it would refer
 to the next datum in a series
 He had only to increment the index register
 each time through
 Mel never used it

 Instead he would pull the instruction into a machine register
 add one to its address
 and store it back
 He would then execute the modified instruction
 right from the register
 The loop was written so this additional execution time
 was taken into account 
 just as this instruction finished
 the next one was right under the drums read head
 ready to go
 But the loop had no test in it

 The vital clue came when I noticed
 the index register bit
 the bit that lay between the address
 and the operation code in the instruction word
 was turned on 
 yet Mel never used the index register
 leaving it zero all the time
 When the light went on it nearly blinded me

 He had located the data he was working on
 near the top of memory 
 the largest locations the instructions could address 
 so after the last datum was handled
 incrementing the instruction address
 would make it overflow
 The carry would add one to the
 operation code changing it to the next one in the instruction set
 a jump instruction
 Sure enough the next program instruction was
 in address location zero
 and the program went happily on its way

 I havent kept in touch with Mel
 so I dont know if he ever gave in to the flood of
 change that has washed over programming techniques
 since those longgone days
 I like to think he didnt
 In any event
 I was impressed enough that I quit looking for the
 offending test
 telling the Big Boss I couldnt find it
 He didnt seem surprised

 When I left the company
 the blackjack program would still cheat
 if you turned on the right sense switch
 and I think thats how it should be
 I didnt feel comfortable
 hacking up the code of a Real Programmer


This is one of hackerdoms great heroic epics free verse or no In a
few spare images it captures more about the esthetics and psychology of
hacking than all the scholarly volumes on the subject put together For
an opposing point of view see the entry for real programmer

1992 postscript  the author writes The original submission to
the net was not in free verse nor any approximation to it  it was
straight prose style in nonjustified paragraphs In bouncing around
the net it apparently got modified into the free verse form now
popular In other words it got hacked on the net That seems
appropriate somehow

Appendix B A Portrait of J Random Hacker


This profile reflects detailed comments on an earlier trial balloon
version from about a hundred USENET respondents Where comparatives are
used the implicit other is a randomly selected segment of the
nonhacker population of the same size as hackerdom

An important point Except in some relatively minor respects such as
slang vocabulary hackers dont get to be the way they are by imitating
each other Rather it seems to be the case that the combination of
personality traits that makes a hacker so conditions ones outlook on
life that one tends to end up being like other hackers whether one wants
to or not much as bizarrely detailed similarities in behavior and
preferences are found in genetic twins raised separately


General Appearance


Intelligent Scruffy Intense Abstracted Surprisingly for a
sedentary profession more hackers run to skinny than fat both
extremes are more common than elsewhere Tans are rare


Dress


Casual vaguely posthippie Tshirts jeans running shoes
Birkenstocks or bare feet Long hair beards and moustaches are
common High incidence of tiedye and intellectual or humorous slogan
Tshirts only rarely computer related that would be too obvious

A substantial minority prefers outdoorsy clothing  hiking boots
in case a mountain should suddenly spring up in the machine room as
one famous parody put it khakis lumberjack or chamois shirts and the
like

Very few actually fit the National Lampoon Nerd stereotype though it
lingers on at MIT and may have been more common before 1975 These
days backpacks are more common than briefcases and the hacker look
is more wholeearth than wholepolyester

Hackers dress for comfort function and minimal maintenance hassles
rather than for appearance some perhaps unfortunately take this to
extremes and neglect personal hygiene They have a very low tolerance
of suits and other business attire in fact it is not uncommon for
hackers to quit a job rather than conform to a dress code

Female hackers almost never wear visible makeup and many use none at
all


Reading Habits


Omnivorous but usually includes lots of science and science fiction
The typical hacker household might subscribe to Analog Scientific
American CoEvolution Quarterly and Smithsonian Hackers often
have a reading range that astonishes liberal arts people but tend not to
talk about it as much Many hackers spend as much of their spare time
reading as the average American burns up watching TV and often keep
shelves and shelves of wellthumbed books in their homes


Other Interests


Some hobbies are widely shared and recognized as going with the culture
science fiction music medievalism in the active form practiced by the
Society for Creative Anachronism and similar organizations chess go
backgammon wargames and intellectual games of all kinds
Roleplaying games such as Dungeons and Dragons used to be extremely
popular among hackers but they lost a bit of their luster as they moved
into the mainstream and became heavily commercialized Logic puzzles
Ham radio Other interests that seem to correlate less strongly but
positively with hackerdom include linguistics and theater teching


Physical Activity and Sports


Many perhaps even most hackers dont follow or do sports at all and
are determinedly antiphysical Among those who do interest in
spectator sports is low to nonexistent sports are something one
does not something one watches on TV

Further hackers avoid most team sports like the plague volleyball is a
notable exception perhaps because its noncontact and relatively
friendly Hacker sports are almost always primarily selfcompetitive
ones involving concentration stamina and micromotor skills martial
arts bicycling auto racing kite flying hiking rock climbing
aviation targetshooting sailing caving juggling skiing skating
ice and roller Hackers delight in technotoys also tends to draw
them towards hobbies with nifty complicated equipment that they can
tinker with


Education


Nearly all hackers past their teens are either collegedegreed or
selfeducated to an equivalent level The selftaught hacker is often
considered at least by other hackers to be bettermotivated and may
be more respected than his schoolshaped counterpart Academic areas
from which people often gravitate into hackerdom include besides the
obvious computer science and electrical engineering physics
mathematics linguistics and philosophy


Things Hackers Detest and Avoid


IBM mainframes Smurfs Ewoks and other forms of offensive cuteness
Bureaucracies Stupid people Easy listening music Television
except for cartoons movies the old Star Trek and the new
Simpsons Business suits Dishonesty Incompetence
Boredom COBOL BASIC Characterbased menu interfaces


Food


Ethnic Spicy Oriental esp Chinese and most esp Szechuan Hunan
and Mandarin hackers consider Cantonese vaguely declasse Hackers
prefer the exotic for example the Japanesefood fans among them will
eat with gusto such delicacies as fugu poisonous pufferfish and whale
Thai food has experienced flurries of popularity Where available
highquality Jewish delicatessen food is much esteemed A visible
minority of Southwestern and Pacific Coast hackers prefers Mexican

For those allnight hacks pizza and microwaved burritos are big
Interestingly though the mainstream culture has tended to think of
hackers as incorrigible junkfood junkies many have at least mildly
healthfoodist attitudes and are fairly discriminating about what they
eat This may be generational anecdotal evidence suggests that the
stereotype was more on the mark 1015 years ago


Politics


Vaguely left of center except for the strong libertarian contingent
which rejects conventional leftright politics entirely The only safe
generalization is that hackers tend to be rather antiauthoritarian
thus both conventional conservatism and hard leftism are rare
Hackers are far more likely than most nonhackers to either a be
aggressively apolitical or b entertain peculiar or idiosyncratic
political ideas and actually try to live by them daytoday


Gender and Ethnicity


Hackerdom is still predominantly male However the percentage of women
is clearly higher than the lowsingledigit range typical for technical
professions and female hackers are generally respected and dealt with
as equals

In the US hackerdom is predominantly Caucasian with strong minorities
of Jews East Coast and Orientals West Coast The Jewish contingent
has exerted a particularly pervasive cultural influence see Food
above and note that several common jargon terms are obviously mutated
Yiddish

The ethnic distribution of hackers is understood by them to be a
function of which ethnic groups tend to seek and value education
Racial and ethnic prejudice is notably uncommon and tends to be met with
freezing contempt

When asked hackers often ascribe their cultures gender and
colorblindness to a positive effect of textonly network channels
and this is doubtless a powerful influence Also the ties many
hackers have to AI research and SF literature may have helped them to
develop an idea of personhood that is inclusive rather than exclusive
 after all if ones imagination readily grants full human rights to AI
programs robots dolphins and extraterrestrial aliens mere color and
gender cant seem very important any more


Religion



Agnostic Atheist Nonobservant Jewish Neopagan Very commonly
three or more of these are combined in the same person Conventional
faithholding Christianity is rare though not unknown

Even hackers who identify with a religious affiliation tend to be
relaxed about it hostile to organized religion in general and all forms
of religious bigotry in particular Many enjoy parody religions such
as Discordianism and the Church of the SubGenius

Also many hackers are influenced to varying degrees by Zen Buddhism or
less commonly Taoism and blend them easily with their native
religions

There is a definite strain of mystical almost Gnostic sensibility that
shows up even among those hackers not actively involved with
neopaganism Discordianism or Zen Hacker folklore that pays homage
to wizards and speaks of incantations and demons has too much
psychological truthfulness about it to be entirely a joke


Ceremonial Chemicals


Most hackers dont smoke tobacco and use alcohol in moderation if at
all though there is a visible contingent of exoticbeer fanciers and a
few hackers are serious oenophiles Limited use of nonaddictive
psychedelic drugs such as cannabis LSD psilocybin and nitrous oxide
etc used to be relatively common and is still regarded with more
tolerance than in the mainstream culture Use of downers and opiates
on the other hand appears to be particularly rare hackers seem in
general to dislike drugs that dumb them down On the third hand many
hackers regularly wire up on caffeine andor sugar for allnight hacking
runs


Communication Style


See the discussions of speech and writing styles near the beginning of
this File Though hackers often have poor persontoperson
communication skills they are as a rule extremely sensitive to nuances
of language and very precise in their use of it They are often better
at writing than at speaking


Geographical Distribution


In the United States hackerdom revolves on a Bay AreatoBoston axis
about half of the hard core seems to live within a hundred miles of
Cambridge Massachusetts or Berkeley California although there are
significant contingents in Los Angeles in the Pacific Northwest and
around Washington DC Hackers tend to cluster around large cities
especially university towns such as the RaleighDurham area in North
Carolina or Princeton New Jersey this may simply reflect the fact that
many are students or exstudents living near their alma maters


Sexual Habits


Hackerdom tolerates a much wider range of sexual and lifestyle variation
than the mainstream culture It includes a relatively large gay and bi
contingent Hackers are somewhat more likely to live in polygynous or
polyandrous relationships practice open marriage or live in communes
or group houses In this as in general appearance hackerdom
semiconsciously maintains counterculture values


Personality Characteristics


The most obvious common personality characteristics of hackers are
high intelligence consuming curiosity and facility with intellectual
abstractions Also most hackers are neophiles stimulated by and
appreciative of novelty especially intellectual novelty Most are
also relatively individualistic and anticonformist

Although high general intelligence is common among hackers it is not
the sine qua non one might expect Another trait is probably even more
important the ability to mentally absorb retain and reference large
amounts of meaningless detail trusting to later experience to give it
context and meaning A person of merely average analytical intelligence
who has this trait can become an effective hacker but a creative genius
who lacks it will swiftly find himself outdistanced by people who
routinely upload the contents of thick reference manuals into their
brains During the production of the book version of this document
for example I learned most of the rather complex typesetting language
TeX over about four working days mainly by inhaling Knuths 477page
manual My editors flabbergasted reaction to this genuinely surprised
me because years of associating with hackers have conditioned me to
consider such performances routine and to be expected  ESR

Contrary to stereotype hackers are not usually intellectually narrow
they tend to be interested in any subject that can provide mental
stimulation and can often discourse knowledgeably and even
interestingly on any number of obscure subjects  if you can get them
to talk at all as opposed to say going back to their hacking

It is noticeable and contrary to many outsiders expectations that the
better a hacker is at hacking the more likely he or she is to have
outside interests at which he or she is more than merely competent

Hackers are control freaks in a way that has nothing to do with the
usual coercive or authoritarian connotations of the term In the same
way that children delight in making model trains go forward and back by
moving a switch hackers love making complicated things like computers
do nifty stuff for them But it has to be their nifty stuff They
dont like tedium nondeterminism or most of the fussy boring
illdefined little tasks that go with maintaining a normal existence
Accordingly they tend to be careful and orderly in their intellectual
lives and chaotic elsewhere Their code will be beautiful even if
their desks are buried in 3 feet of crap

Hackers are generally only very weakly motivated by conventional rewards
such as social approval or money They tend to be attracted by
challenges and excited by interesting toys and to judge the interest of
work or other activities in terms of the challenges offered and the toys
they get to play with

In terms of MyersBriggs and equivalent psychometric systems hackerdom
appears to concentrate the relatively rare INTJ and INTP types that is
introverted intuitive and thinker types as opposed to the
extrovertedsensate personalities that predominate in the mainstream
culture ENTJP types are also concentrated among hackers but are in
a minority


Weaknesses of the Hacker Personality


Hackers have relatively little ability to identify emotionally with
other people This may be because hackers generally arent much like
other people Unsurprisingly hackers also tend towards
selfabsorption intellectual arrogance and impatience with people and
tasks perceived to be wasting their time

As cynical as hackers sometimes wax about the amount of idiocy in the
world they tend by reflex to assume that everyone is as rational
cool and imaginative as they consider themselves This bias often
contributes to weakness in communication skills Hackers tend to be
especially poor at confrontation and negotiation

Because of their passionate embrace of what they consider to be the
Right Thing hackers can be unfortunately intolerant and bigoted on
technical issues in marked contrast to their general spirit of
camaraderie and tolerance of alternative viewpoints otherwise Oldtime
ITS partisans look down on the evergrowing hordes of UNIX
hackers UNIX aficionados despise VMS and MSDOS and hackers who
are used to conventional commandline user interfaces loathe
mouseandmenu based systems such as the Macintosh Hackers who dont
indulge in USENET consider it a huge waste of time and bandwidth
fans of old adventure games such as ADVENT and Zork consider MUDs
to be glorified chat systems devoid of atmosphere or interesting
puzzles hackers who are willing to devote endless hours to USENET or
MUDs consider IRC to be a real waste of time IRCies think MUDs
might be okay if there werent all those silly puzzles in the way And
of course there are the perennial holy wars  EMACS vs vi
bigendian vs littleendian RISC vs CISC etc etc etc As
in society at large the intensity and duration of these debates is
usually inversely proportional to the number of objective factual
arguments available to buttress any position

As a result of all the above traits many hackers have difficulty
maintaining stable relationships At worst they can produce the
classic computer geek withdrawn relationally incompetent sexually
frustrated and desperately unhappy when not submerged in his or her
craft Fortunately this extreme is far less common than mainstream
folklore paints it  but almost all hackers will recognize something
of themselves in the unflattering paragraphs above

Hackers are often monumentally disorganized and sloppy about dealing
with the physical world Bills dont get paid on time clutter piles up
to incredible heights in homes and offices and minor maintenance tasks
get deferred indefinitely

The sort of person who uses phrases like incompletely socialized
usually thinks hackers are Hackers regard such people with contempt
when they notice them at all


Miscellaneous


Hackers are more likely to have cats than dogs in fact it is widely
grokked that cats have the hacker nature Many drive incredibly
decrepit heaps and forget to wash them richer ones drive spiffy
Porsches and RX7s and then forget to have them washed Almost all
hackers have terribly bad handwriting and often fall into the habit of
blockprinting everything like junior draftsmen

Appendix C Bibliography


Here are some other books you can read to help you understand the hacker
mindset


Godel Escher Bach An Eternal Golden Braid
Douglas Hofstadter
Basic Books 1979
ISBN 0394745027

This book reads like an intellectual Grand Tour of hacker
preoccupations Music mathematical logic programming speculations on
the nature of intelligence biology and Zen are woven into a brilliant
tapestry themed on the concept of encoded selfreference The perfect
leftbrain companion to Illuminatus


Illuminatus
 I The Eye in the Pyramid
 II The Golden Apple
 III Leviathan
Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson
Dell 1988
ISBN 0440539811

This work of alleged fiction is an incredible berserkosurrealist
rollercoaster of worldgirdling conspiracies intelligent dolphins the
fall of Atlantis who really killed JFK sex drugs rocknroll and
the Cosmic Giggle Factor First published in three volumes but there
is now a onevolume trade paperback carried by most chain bookstores
under SF The perfect rightbrain companion to Hofstadters Godel
Escher Bach See Eris Discordianism random numbers Church
Of The SubGenius


The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy
Douglas Adams
Pocket Books 1981
ISBN 0671461494

This Monty Python in Space spoof of SF genre traditions has been
popular among hackers ever since the original British radio show Read
it if only to learn about Vogons see bogon and the significance of
the number 42 see random numbers  and why the winningest chess
program of 1990 was called Deep Thought


The Tao of Programming
James Geoffrey
Infobooks 1987
ISBN 0931137071

This gentle funny spoof of the Tao Te Ching contains much that is
illuminating about the hacker way of thought When you have learned to
snatch the error code from the trap frame it will be time for you to
leave


Hackers
Steven Levy
AnchorDoubleday 1984
ISBN 0385191952

Levys book is at its best in describing the early MIT hackers at the
Model Railroad Club and the early days of the microcomputer revolution
He never understood UNIX or the networks though and his enshrinement
of Richard Stallman as the last true hacker turns out thankfully to
have been quite misleading Numerous minor factual errors also mar the
text for example Levys claim that the original Jargon File derived
from the TMRC Dictionary the File originated at Stanford and was
brought to MIT in 1976 the coauthors of the first edition had never
seen the dictionary in question There are also numerous misspellings
in the book that inflame the passions of oldtimers as Dan Murphy the
author of TECO once said You would have thought hed take the trouble
to spell the name of a winning editor right Nevertheless this
remains a useful and stimulating book that captures the feel of several
important hackish subcultures


The Devils DP Dictionary
Stan KellyBootle
McGrawHill 1981
ISBN 0070340226

This pastiche of Ambrose Bierces famous work is similar in format to
the Jargon File and quotes several entries from jargon1 but somewhat
different in tone and intent It is more satirical and less
anthropological and is largely a product of the authors literate and
quirky imagination For example it defines computer science as a
study akin to numerology and astrology but lacking the precision of the
former and the success of the latter and the boring art of coping with
a large number of trivialities


The Devouring Fungus Tales from the Computer Age
Karla Jennings
Norton 1990
ISBN 0393307328

The author of this pioneering compendium knits together a great deal of
computer and hackerrelated folklore with good writing and a few
wellchosen cartoons She has a keen eye for the human aspects of the
lore and is very good at illuminating the psychology and evolution of
hackerdom Unfortunately a number of small errors and awkwardnesses
suggest that she didnt have the final manuscript checked over by a
native speaker the glossary in the back is particularly embarrassing
and at least one classic tale the Magic Switch story retold here under
A Story About Magic in appendix A is given in incomplete and
badly mangled form Nevertheless this book is a win overall and can be
enjoyed by hacker and nonhacker alike


The Soul of a New Machine
Tracy Kidder
Little Brown 1981
paperback Avon 1982
ISBN 0380599317

This book a 1982 Pulitzer Prize winner documents the adventure of the
design of a new Data General computer the Eclipse It is an amazingly
welldone portrait of the hacker mindset  although largely the
hardware hacker  done by a complete outsider It is a bit thin in
spots but with enough technical information to be entertaining to the
serious hacker while providing nontechnical people a view of what
daytoday life can be like  the fun the excitement the disasters
During one period when the microcode and logic were glitching at the
nanosecond level one of the overworked engineers departed the company
leaving behind a note on his terminal as his letter of resignation I
am going to a commune in Vermont and will deal with no unit of time
shorter than a season


Life with UNIX a Guide for Everyone
Don Libes and Sandy Ressler
PrenticeHall 1989
ISBN 0135366577

The authors of this book set out to tell you all the things about UNIX
that tutorials and technical books wont The result is gossipy funny
opinionated downright weird in spots and invaluable Along the way
they expose you to enough of UNIXs history folklore and humor to
qualify as a firstclass source for these things Because so much of
todays hackerdom is involved with UNIX this in turn illuminates many
of its injokes and preoccupations


True Names  and Other Dangers
Vernor Vinge
Baen Books 1987
ISBN 0671653636

Hacker demigod Richard Stallman believes the title story of this book
expresses the spirit of hacking best This may well be true its
certainly difficult to recall a better job The other stories in this
collection are also fine work by an author who is perhaps one of todays
very best practitioners of hard SF


Cyberpunk Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier
Katie Hafner  John Markoff
Simon  Schuster 1991
ISBN 0671683225

This book gathers narratives about the careers of three notorious
crackers into a cleareyed but sympathetic portrait of hackerdoms dark
side The principals are Kevin Mitnick Pengo and Hagbard of the
Chaos Computer Club and Robert T Morris see RTM sense 2 
Markoff and Hafner focus as much on their psychologies and motivations
as on the details of their exploits but dont slight the latter The
result is a balanced and fascinating account particularly useful when
read immediately before or after Cliff Stolls The Cuckoos Egg It
is especially instructive to compare RTM a true hacker who blundered
with the sociopathic phonefreak Mitnick and the alienated drugaddled
crackers who made the Chaos Club notorious The gulf between wizard
and wannabee has seldom been made more obvious


Technobabble
John Barry
MIT Press 1991
ISBN 0262023334

Barrys book takes a critical and humorous look at the technobabble of
acronyms neologisms hyperbole and metaphor spawned by the computer
industry Though he discusses some of the same mechanisms of jargon
formation that occur in hackish most of what he chronicles is actually
suitspeak  the obfuscatory language of press releases marketroids
and Silicon Valley CEOs rather than the playful jargon of hackers most
of whom wouldnt be caught dead uttering the kind of pompous
passivevoiced word salad he deplores


The Cuckoos Egg
Clifford Stoll
Doubleday 1989
ISBN 0385249462

Clifford Stolls absorbing tale of how he tracked Markus Hess and the
Chaos Club cracking ring nicely illustrates the difference between
hacker and cracker Stolls portrait of himself his lady Martha
and his friends at Berkeley and on the Internet paints a marvelously
vivid picture of how hackers and the people around them like to live and
what they think

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 httpwwwgutenbergnet

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
