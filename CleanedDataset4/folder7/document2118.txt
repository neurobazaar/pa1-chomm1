BOOK XVIIISEVENYEARS WAR RISES TO A HEIGHT17571759




Chapter ITHE CAMPAIGN OPENS

Seldom was there seen such a combination against any man as this against
Friedrich after his Saxon performances in 1756 The extent of his sin
which is now ascertained to have been what we saw was at that time
considered to transcend all computation and to mark him out for
partition for suppression and enchainment as the general enemy of
mankind Partition him cut him down said the Great Powers to one
another and are busy as never before in raising forces inciting new
alliances and calling out the general POSSE COMITATUS of mankind for
that salutary object What tempestuous fulminations in the Reichstag
and over all Europe England alone excepted against this man

Latterly the Swedes who at first had compunctions on the score of
Protestantism have agreed to join in the Partitioning adventure It
brings us his Pommern all Pommern ours cry the Swedish Parliamentary
Eloquences with French gold in their pocket At any rate whisper
they it spites the Queen his Sisterand drag the poor Swedish
Nation into a series of disgraces and disastrous platitudes it was
little anticipating This precious FrenchSwedish Bargain Swedes to
invade with 25000 France to give fair subsidy and bribe largely was
consummated in March 21st March 1757 Stenzel v 38 c but
did not become known to Friedrich for some months later nor was it of
the importance he then thought it in the first moment of surprise and
provocation Not indeed of importance to anybody except in the reverse
way to poor Sweden itself and to the French who had spent a great
deal of pains and money on it and continued to spend with as good as
no result at all For there never was such a War before or since
not even by Sweden in the Captainless state And the one profit the
copartners reaped from it was some discountenance it gave to the rumor
which had risen more extensively than we should now think and even
some nucleus of fact in it as appears That Austria France and the
Catholic part of the Reich were combining to put down Protestantism To
which they could now answer See Protestant Sweden is with usand
so weaken a little what was pretty much Friedrichs last hold on the
public sympathies at this time

As to France itselfto France Austria Russiabound by such
earthly Treaties and the call of very Heaven shall they not in united
puissance and indignation rise to the rescue France touched to the
heart by such treatment of a Saxon Kurfurst and bound by Treaty of
Westphalia to protect all members of the Reich which it has sometimes
to our own knowledge so carefully done is almost more ardent than
Austria itself France Austria Russia to these add Polish Majesty
himself and latterly the very Swedes by French bribery at Stockholm
these are the Partitioning Powersand their shares let us spare one
line for their shares are as follows

The Swedes are to have Pommern in whole PolishSaxon Majesty gets
Magdeburg Halle and opulent slices thereabouts Austrias share
we need not say is that jewel of a Silesia Czarish Majesty on the
extreme East takes Preussen KonigsbergMemel Country in whole adds
Preussen to her as yet too narrow Territories WeselCleve Country from
the other or Western extremity France will take that clipping and make
much of it These are quite serious businessengagements engrossed on
careful parchment that Spring 1757 and I suppose not yet boiled down
into glue but still to be found in dusty corners with the tape much
faded The high heads making preparation on the due scale think them
not only executable but indubitable and almost as good as done Push
home upon him as united Posse Comitatus of Mankind in a sacred cause
of Polish Majesty and Public Justice how can one malefactor resistAH
MA TRESCHERE and Oh my dearest Princess and Cousin what a chance
has turned up

It is computed that there are arrayed against this one King under
their respective Kings EmpressQueens Swedish Senates Catins and
Pompadours populations to the amount of above 100 millionsin after
stages I remember to have seen 150 millions loosely given as the
exaggerated cipher Of armed soldiers actually in the field against him
against Hanover and him in 1757 there are by strict count 430000
Friedrichs own Dominions at this time contain about Five Millions of
Population of Revenue somewhat less than Two Millions sterling New
taxes he cannot legally and will not lay on his People His SCHATZ
readymoney Treasure or Hoard yearly accumulating for such end is I
doubt not well filledexpress amount not mentioned Of drilled men he
has this Year 150000 for the field portioned out thriftilyas well
beseems against Four Invasions coming on him from different points In
the field 150000 soldiers probably the best that ever were and
in garrison up and down his Country being by nature the least
defensible of all Countries near 40000 which he reckons of inferior
quality So stands the account Stenzel iv 308 306 v 39 Ranke
iii 415 Preuss ii 389 43 124 c csubstantially true I
doubt not but little or nothing of it so definite and conclusively
distinct as it ought in all items to have been by this timehad poor
Dryasdust known what he was doing These are arithmetically precise
his resourcesPLUS only what may lie in his own head and heart or
funded in the other heads and hearts especially in those 150000
which he and his Fathers have been diligently disciplining to good
perfection for four centuries come the time

France urged by Pompadour and the enthusiasms was first in the field
The French Army in superb equipment though privately in poorish state
of discipline took the road early in March March 26th and 27th
it crossed the German Border Cleve Country and Koln Country had been
rumored of since January and February last as terrifically grand
and here it now actually is above 100000 strong110405 as
the ArmyLists flaming through all the Newspapers teach mankind
_HeldenGeschichte_ iv 391 iii 1073 Bent mainly upon Prussia
it would seem such the will of Pompadour Mainly upon Prussia Marechal
dEstrees crossing at Koln made offers even to his Britannic Majesty
to be forgiven in comparison Yield us a road through your Hanover
merely a road to those HalberstadtMagdeburg parts your Hanover shall
have neutrality Neutrality to Hanover sighed Britannic Majesty
Alas am not I pledged by Treaty And alas withal how is it
possible with that America hanging over us and stood true Nor is
this all on the part of magnanimous France there is a Soubise getting
under way withal Soubise and 30000 who will reinforce the Reichs
Armament were it on foot and be heard of by and by So high runs
French enthusiasm at present A new sting of provocation to Most
Christian Majesty it seems has been Friedrichs conduct in that
Damiens matter miserable attempt by a poor mad creature to
assassinate or at least draw blood upon the Most Christian Majesty
Evening of 5th January 1757 exuberantly plentiful details of it
and of the horrible Lawprocedures which followed on it In Adelung
viii 197220 Barbier c c about which Friedrich busy
and oblivious had never in common politeness been at the pains to
condole compliment or take any notice whatever And will now take the
consequences as due

The WeselCleve Countries these French find abandoned Friedrichs
garrisons have had orders to bring off the artillery and stores blow up
what of the works are suitable for blowing up and join the Britannic
Army of Observation which is getting itself together in those regions
Considerable Army Britannic wholly in the money part new Hanoverians
so many Brunswickers Buckeburgers SachsenGothaers so many add those
precious HanoverianHessian 20000 whom we have had in England guarding
our liberties so longwho are now shipped over in a lot fair wind
and full sea to them Army of 60000 on paper of effective more than
50000 Headquarters now at Bielefeld on the Weserwhere April
16th or a few days later Royal Highness of Cumberland comes to take
command likely to make a fine figure against Marechal dEstrees and his
100000 French But there was no helping it Friedrich through Winter
has had Schmettau earnestly flagitating the Hanoverian Officialities
The Weser is wadable in many places you cannot defend the Weser
and counselling and pleading to all lengthswithout the least effect
Wants to save his own Halberstadt lands at our expense Which was the
idea in London too Dont we by Apocalyptic Newswriters and eyesight
of our own understand the man Pitt is by this time in Office
who perhaps might have judged a little otherwise But Pitts seat is
altogether temporary insecure the ruling deities Newcastle and
Royal Highness who withal are in standing quarrel So that Friedrich
Schmettau Mitchell pleaded to the deaf Nothing but Defend the Weser
and ignorant Fatuity ready for the Impossible is to be made out there
Cannot help it then thinks Friedrich often enough in bad moments
Army of Observation will have its fate Happily there are only 5000
Prussians in it Wesel and the other garrisons given up

Only 5000 Prussians by original Engagement there should have
been 25000 and Friedrichs intention is even 45000 if he prosper
otherwise For in January 1757 Anniversary or nearly so of that
NEUTRALITY CONVENTION last year there had beenencouraged by Pitt
as I could surmise who always likes Friedricha definite much closer
TREATY OF ALLIANCE with Subsidy of a million sterling AntiRussian
Squadron of Observation in the Baltic 25000 Prussians and other
items which I forget Forget the more readily as owing to the strange
state of England near suffocating in its Constitutional bedclothes
the Treaty could not be kept at all or serve as rule to poor Englands
exertions for Friedrich this Year exertions which were of the
willingminded but futile kind going forward pellmell not by plan
and could reach Friedrich only in the lumphad there been any lump
of them to sum together But Pitt had gone outwe shall see what in
Pitts absence there was So that this Treaty 1757 fell quite into
the wastebasket not to say far deeper by way of pavement we know
whereand is not mentioned in any English Book nor was known to
exist till some Collector of such things printed it in comparatively
recent times M Koch in 1802 not very perfectly Scholl iii 30

Foreshadow of Pitts new Treaty in January 1758 and of three others

REICHS THUNDER SLIGHT SURVEY OF IT WITH QUESTION WHITHERWARD IF
ANYWHITHER

The thunderous fulminations in the ReichsDietan injured Saxony
complaining an insulted Kaiser after vain DEHORTATORIUMS reporting
and denouncing Horrors such as these What say you O Reichhave
been going on since September last and amount to boundless masses
of the liveliest Parliamentary Eloquence now fallen extinct to all
creatures Given to great lengths in _HeldenGeschichte_ iii iv
and other easily avoidable Books The Kaiser otherwise a solid
pacific gentleman intent on commercial operations furnishes a good
deal of our meal says Friedrich is Officially extremely violent in
behalf of injured Saxonythat is to say in fact of injured Austria
which is ones own KurMainz Chairman of the Diet we remember how he
was got and a Battle of Dettingen fought in consequence long since
KurMainz is admitted to have the most decided Austrian leanings
Britannic George Austria being now in the opposite scale finds him
an unhandy KurMainz and what profit it was to introduce false weights
into the Reichs balance that time Not for long generations before had
the poor old semiimaginary ReichsDiet risen into such paroxysms nor
did it ever again after Never again in its terrestrial History was
there such agonistic parliamentary struggle and terrific noise of
parliamentary palaver witnessed in the poor ReichsDiet Noise and
struggle rising ever higher peal after peal from September 1756 when
it started till August 1757 when it had reached its acme as perhaps
we shall see though it was far from ending then or for years to come

Contemporary bystanders remark on the Austrian part extraordinary
rage and hatred against Prussia which is now the one point memorable
Austria is used to speak loud in the Diet as we have ourselves seen
and it is again if you dive into those old AEolusCaves at your
peril unpleasantly notable to what pitch of fixed rage and hot sullen
hatred Austria has now gone and how the tone has in it a potency of
worldwide squealing and droning such as you nowhere heard before
Omnipotence of droning edged with shrieky squealing which fills the
Universe not at all in a melodious way From the depths of the gamut
to the shrieky top againa droning that has something of porcine or
wildboar character Figure assembled the wild boars of the world all
or mostly all got together and each with a knife just stuck into its
side by a felonious individual too well knownyou will have some
notion of the sound of these things Friedrich sometimes remonstrates
Cannot you spare such phraseology unseemly to Kings The quarrels of
Kings have to be decided by the sword what profit in unseemly language
Madambut for the first year and more there was no abatement on the
Austrian part

Friedrichs own Delegate at Regensburg a Baron von Plotho come of
old Brandenburg kindred is a resolute readytongued very undaunted
gentleman learned in Diplomacies and Reichs Law carries his head
high and always has his story at hand Argument grounded on Reichs
Law and the nature of the case Plotho never lacks on spur of the hour
and is indeed a very commendable parliamentary mastiff and honorable
and melodious in the bark of him compared with those infuriated
porcine specimens He has KurHanover for ally on common occasions and
generally from most Protestant members individually or from the CORPUS
EVANGELICORUM in mass some feeble whimper of support Finds difficulty
in getting his Reichs Pleadings printeddangerous everywhere in
those Southern Parts to print anything whatever that is not Austrian
so that Plotho at length gets printers to himself and sets up a
PrintingPress in his own house at Regensburg He did a great deal of
sonorous pleading for Friedrich proud deepvoiced ruggedly logical
fairly beyond the Austrian quality in many casesand always far
briefer which is another high merit October coming we purpose to
look in upon Plotho for one minute October 14th 1757 which may
be reckoned essentially the acme or turningpoint of these unpleasant
thunderings _HeldenGeschichte_ iv 745749

What good he did to Friedrich or could have done with the tongue of
angels in such an audience we do not accurately know Some good he
would do even in the ReichsDiet there and out of doors over a German
public still more and is worth his frugal wagessay 1000 pounds a
year printing and all other expense included This is a mere guess of
mine Dryasdust having been incurious but to English readers it is
incredible for what sums Friedrich got his work done no work ever
better Which is itself an appreciable advantage computable in pounds
sterling and is the parent of innumerable others which no Arithmetic
or Bookkeeping by Double Entry will take hold of and which are indeed
priceless for Nations and for persons But this poor old bedridden
Reich starting in agonistic spasm at such rate is it not touching in
a Corpus moribund for so many Centuries past The Reich is something
though it is not much nothing like so much as even Kaiser Franz
supposes it Much or not so much Kaiser Franz wishes to secure it for
himself Friedrich to hinder himand it must be a poor something if
not worth Plothos wages on Friedrichs part

It would insult the patience of every reader to go into these spasmodic
tossings of the poor paralytic Reich or to mention the least item of
them beyond what had some result or fraction of result on the worlds
real affairs We shall say only therefore that after tempests not a
few of porcine squealing answered always by counterlatration on the
vigilant Plothos partsquealing chiefly from the ReichsHofrath
at Vienna the Head Tribunal of Imperial Majesty which sits judging and
denouncing there touched to the soul as if by a knife driven into
its side by those unheardof treatments of Saxony and disregard to
our DEHORTATORIUMS and which bursts out peal after peal filling the
Universe Plotho not unvigilantthe poor old ReichsDiet did at
last get into an acting posture and determine by clear majority of 99
against 60 that there should be a Reichs Execution Army got on foot
Reichs Execution Army to coerce by force of arms this nefarious King
of Prussia into making instant restitution to Saxony with ample damages
on the nail that right be done to Kurfursts of this Reich To such
height of vigor has the ReichsDiet goneand was voting it at
Regensburg January 10th 1757 _HeldenGeschichte_ iv 252 302
330 Stenzel v 32 that very day when nefarious Friedrich at Berlin
casehardened in iniquity to such a pitch sat writing his INSTRUCTION
TO COUNT FINCK which we read not long since Simultaneous movements
unknown to one another in this big wrestle

ReichsDiet perfected its Vote had it quite through and sanctioned
by the Kaisers Majesty January 29th Arming to be a TRIPLUM triple
contingent required of you this time with Romishmonths ROMERMONATE
of cash contributions from all and sundry rigorously gathered I should
hope where Austria has power so many as will cover the expense Army
to be got on actual foot hastily instantly if possible an EILENDE
REICHSEXECUTIONS ARMEE so it ran but the word EILENDE speedy had
a mischance in printing and was struck off into ELENDE contemptibly
wretched so that on all MarketSquares and Public Places of poor
Teutschland you read flaming Placards summoning out not a speedy or
immediate but a MISERABLE Reichs Execution Army A word which we
need not say was laughed at by the unfeeling part of the public and
was often called to mind by the Reichs Execution Armys performances
when said SPEEDY Army did at last take the field

For the Reich performed its Vote actually had a Reichs Execution Army
the last it ever had in this world not by any means the worst it ever
had for they used generally to be bad Commanders managers are named
Romermonate are gathered in or the sure prospect of them and
through MayJune 1757 there is busy stir of drumming preparing and
enlisting all over the Reich End of July we shall see the Reichs
Army in Camp end of August actually in the field and later on a
touch of its fighting withal Many other things the Reich tried against
unfortunate Friedrichgradual advance in fact to Ban of the Reich
or total anathema and cuttingoff from fire and water but in none of
these in Ban as little as any did it come to practical result at all
or acquire the least title to be remembered at this day Finis of Ban
some eight months hence has something of attractive as futility
the curious Death of a Futility Finis of Ban October 14th already
indicated we may for one moment look in upon if there be one moment
to spare the restreaders may fancy it and read only of the actuality
and fighting part which will itself be enough for them on such a
matter




FRIEDRICH SUDDENLY MARCHES ON PRAG

Four Invasions from their respective points of the compass northeast
northwest southeast and southwest here is a formidable outlook for
the one man against whom they are all advancing openmouthed The one
manwith nothing but a Duke of Cumberland and his Observation Army for
backing in such duelhad need to look to himself Which we well know
he does wrapt in profoundly silent vigilance with his plans all laid
Of the Four Invasions three the Russian French Austrian are
very large and the two latter especially the last are abundantly
formidable The Swedish of which there is rumoring he hopes may come
to little or not come at all Nor is Russia though talking big and
actually getting ready above 100000 men so immediately alarming
Friedrich always hopes the English with their guineas and their
managements will do something for him in that quarter and he knows
at worst that the Russian Hundred Thousand will be a very slowmoving
entity The Swedish Invasion Friedrich for the present leaves to
chance and against Russia he has sent old Marshal Lehwald into those
Baltic parts far eastward towards the utmost Memel Frontier to put
the Country upon its own defence and make what he can of it with 30000
menWestPrussian militias a good few of them This is all he can
spare on the SwedishRussian side Austria and France are the perilous
pair of entities not to be managed except by intense concentration of
stroke and by going on them in succession if one have luck

Friedrichs motions and procedures in cantonquarters through Winter
and in late months have led to the belief that he means to stand on the
defensive that the scene of the Campaign will probably be Saxony
and that Austria for recovering injured Saxony for recovering dear
Silesia will have to take an invasive attitude And Austria is busy
everywhere preparing with that view Has Tolpatcheries and advanced
Brigades still harassing about in the Lausitz A great Army assembling
at PragBrowne forward towards the Metal Mountains securing posts
gathering magazines for the crossing into Saxony there There it is
thought the tug of war will probably be Furious and strenuous it is
not doubted on this Friedrichs part but against such odds what can
he do With Austrians in front with Russians to left with French to
right and arear not to mention Swedes and appendages surely here if
ever is a lost King

It is by no means Friedrichs intention that Saxony itself shall need to
be invaded Friedrichs habit is as his enemies might by this time be
beginning to learn not that of standing on the defensive but that of
GOING on it as the preferable method wherever possible March 24th
Friedrich had quitted Dresden City and for a month after headquarters
Lockwitz edge of the Pirna Country he had been shifting
redistributing his cantoned Armyprivately into the due Divisions
due readiness for march Which done on fixed days about the end of
April the whole Army he himself from Lockwitz April 20thto the
surprise of Austria and the world Friedrich in three grand Columns
Bevern out of the Lausitz King himself over the Metal Mountains
Schwerin out of Schlesien is marching with extraordinary rapidity
direct for Prag in the notion that a right plunge into the heart of
Bohemia will be the best defence for Saxony and the other places under
menace

This is a most unexpected movement which greatly astonishes the
worldtheatre pit boxes and gallery alike as Friedrichs sudden
movements often do and which is above all interesting on the stage
itself where the actors had been counting on a quite opposite set of
entries and activities Feldmarschall Browne and General Konigseck not
our old friend Konigseck who used to drynurse in the Netherlands but
his nephew and heir may cease gathering Magazines in those Lausitz
and MetalMountain parts happy could they give wings to those already
gathered Magazines for Austrian service are clearly not the things
wanted there One does not burn ones Magazines till the last extremity
but wings they have none and such is the enigmatic velocity of those
Prussian movements one seldom has time even to burn them in the last
crisis of catastrophe Considerable portions of that provender fell into
the Prussian throat as much as three months provision for the
whole Army count theyadding to those Frontier sundries the really
important Magazine which they seized at JungBunzlau farther in
_HeldenGeschichte_ iv 613 c It is one among their many greater
advantages from this surprisal of the enemy and sudden topsyturvying
of his plans Browne and Konigseck have to retire on Prag at their
swiftest looking to more important results than Magazines

It is Friedrichs old plan Long since in 1744 we saw a march of this
kind Three Columns rushing with simultaneous rapidity on Prag and need
not repeat the particulars on this occasion Here are some Notes on the
subject which will sufficiently bring it home to readers

The Three Columns were for a part of the way Four the Kings being
at first in two branches till they united again on the other side
of the Hills For the King what is to be noted had shot out three
weeks before a small preliminary branch under Moritz of Dessau who
marched well westward by Eger starting from Chemnitz in Saxony and
had some tussling with our poor old friend Duke dAhremberg Brownes
subordinate in those parts DAhremberg having 20000 under him would
not quit Eger for Moritz but pushed out Croats upon him and sat still
This it was afterwards surmised had been a feint on Friedrichs part
to give the Austrians pleasant thoughts Invading us is he Would fain
invade us but cannot Moritz fell back from Eger and was ready to
join the Kings march at Linay April 23d third day from Lockwitz
on the Kings part Onwards from which point the Columns are
specifically Three in strength and on routes somewhat as follows

1 The FIRST Column or Kingswhich is 60000 after this junction
45000 foot 15000 horsequitted Lockwitz headquarter for a month
past WEDNESDAY APRIL 20TH They go by the Pascopol and other roads
through Pirna for one place through Karbitz Aussig are at Linay on
the 23d where Moritz joins 24th in the united state forward again
leave Lobositz two miles to left to Trebnitz 25th and rest there
one day

At Aussig an unfortunate thing befell Zastrow respectable old General
Zastrow was to drive the Austrians out of Aussig Zastrow does it
April 22d23d drives them well over the heights April 25th however
marching forward towards Lobositz Zastrow is shot through both temples
Pandour hid among the bushes and cliffs OTHER side of Elbe and falls
dead on the spot Buried in GOTTLEUBE Kirk 1st May

In these Aussig affairs especially in recapturing the Castle of
Tetschen near by Colonel Mayer father of the new FreeCorps did
shining serviceand was approved of he and they And a day or
two after was detached with a Fifteen Hundred of that kind on more
important business First to pick up one or two Bohemian Magazines
lying handy after which to pay a visit to the Reich and its bluster
about ExecutionArmy and teach certain persons who it is they are
thundering against in that awkwardly truculent manner Errand shiningly
done by Mayer as perhaps we may hearand certainly as all the
Newspapers loudly heardin the course of the next two months

At crossing of the Eger Friedrichs Column had some chasing of poor
DAhremberg attempting to cut him off from his Bridges Bridge of
Koschlitz Bridge of Budin but he made good despatch Browne and he
and except a few prisoners of Ziethens gathering and most of his
Magazines unburnt they did him no damage The chase was close enough
more than once the Austrian headquarter of tonight was that of the
Prussians tomorrow Monday May 2d Friedrichs Column was on the
Weissenberg of Prag Browne DAhremberg and Prince Karl who is now
come up to take command having hastily filed through the City leaving
a fit garrison the day before Except his Magazines nothing the least
essential went wrong with Browne but Konigseck who had not a Friedrich
on his heelsKonigseck trying more as his opportunities were
morewas not quite so lucky

2 Column SECOND to the Kings left comes from the Lausitz under
BrunswickBevern18000 foot 5000 horse This is the Bevern who so
distinguished himself at Lobositz last year and he is now to culminate
into a still brighter exploitthe last of his very bright ones as it
proved Bevern set out from about Zittau from Grottau few miles south
of Zittau the same day with Friedrich that is April 20thand had
not well started till he came upon formidable obstacles Came upon
General Konigseck namely a Konigseck manoeuvring ahead in superior
force a Maguire Irish subordinate of Konigsecks coming from the
right to cut off our baggage against whom Bevern has to detach a
Lacy coming from the leftor indeed Konigseck and Lacy in concert
intending to offer battle Battle of Reichenberg which accordingly
ensued April 21stof which though it was very famous for so small a
Battle there can be no account given here

The short truth is Konigseck falling back Parthianlike with a force
of 30000 or more has in front of him nothing but Bevern who as he
issues from the Lausitz and till he can unite with Schwerin farther
southward is but some 20000 odd cannot Konigseck call halt and
bid Bevern return or do worse Konigseck a diligent enough soldier
determines to try chooses an excellent positionat or round
Reichenberg which is the first Bohemian Town one march from Zittau in
the Lausitz and then one from Liebenau which latter would be Beverns
SECOND Bohemian stage on the Prag road if he continued prosperous
Reichenberg standing nestled among hills in the Neisse Valley one
of those Four Neisses known to us the Neisse where Prince Karl got
exploded in that signal manner Winter 1745 by a certain King
offers fine capabilities which Konigseck has laid hold of There is
especially one excellent Hollow on the left or western bank of Neisse
River that is ACROSS from Reichenberg backed by woody hills nothing
but hills brooks woods all round Hollow scooped out as if for the
purpose and altogether of inviting character to Konigseck There
Wednesday April 20th Konigseck posts himself plants batteries
fells abatis plenty of cannon of horse and foot and say all
soldiers one of the best positions possible

So that Bevern approaching Reichenberg at evening evening of his
first march Wednesday April 20th finds his way barred and that the
difficulties may be considerable Nothing to be made of it tonight
thinks Bevern but we must try tomorrow and has to take camp
with a marshy brook in front of him some way on the hither side of
Reichenberg and study overnight what method of unbarring there may be
Thursday morning early Bevern having well reconnoitred and studied
was at work unbarring Bevern crossed his own marshy brook courageously
assaulted Konigsecks position left wing of Konigseck stormed the
abatis the batteries plunged in upon Konigseck man to man horse to
horse and after some fierce enough but brief dispute tumbled Konigseck
out of the ground Konigseck made some attempt to rally attempted
twice but in vain had fairly to roll away and at length to run
leaving 1000 dead upon the field about 500 prisoners one or two guns
and I forget how many standards or whether any kettledrums This
was thought to be a decidedly bright feat on Beverns part
rather mismanaged latterly on Konigsecks Tempelhof i 100
_HeldenGeschichte_ iii 1077 Friedrichs own Account Linay in
Bohmen 24th April 1757 c c There is in Buschings _Magazin_
xvi 139 et seq an intelligible sketch of this Action of
Reichenherg with satirical criticisms which have some basis on Lacy
Maguire and others by an Anonymous Military Cynicwho gives many
such in BUSCHING that of Fontenoy for example not without force of
judgment and signs of wide study and experience in his trademuch
approved by Friedrich as he hears of it at Linay on his own
prosperous march Pragward A comfortable omen were there nothing more

Konigseck and Company torn out of Reichenberg and set running could
not fairly halt again and face about till at Liebenau twenty miles off
where they found some defile or difficult bit of ground fit for them
and this too proved capable of yielding pause for a few hours only For
Schwerin with his Silesian Column was coming up from the northeast
threatening Konigseck on flank and rear Konigseck could only tighten
his straps a little at this Liebenau and again get under way and
making vain attempts to hinder the junction of Schwerin and Bevern to
defend the JungBunzlau Magazine or do any good in those parts except
to detain the SchwerinBevern people certain hours I think one day in
all had nothing for it but to gird himself together and retreat on
Prag and the Ziscaberg where his friends now were

The Austrian force at Reichenberg was 20000 would have been 30 and
odd thousands had Maguire come up as he might have done had not the
appearances alarmed him too much Bevern minus the Detachment sent
against Maguire was but 15000 in fight and he has quite burst the
Austrians away who had plugged his road for him in such force is it
not a comfortable little victory glorious in its sort and a good omen
for the bigger things that are coming Bevern marched composedly on
after this inspiriting tussle through Liebenau and what defiles
there were April 24th at Turnau he falls into the Schwerin Column
incorporates himself therewith and as subordinate constituent part
accompanies Schwerin thenceforth

3 Column THIRD was Schwerins out of Schlesien counted to be 32000
foot 12000 horse Schwerin gathering himself from Glatz and the
northerly country at Landshutvery careless he of the pleasant
Hills and fine scattered peaks of the Giant Mountains thereaboutswas
completely gathered foremost of all the Columns having farthest to go
And on Monday 18th April started from Landshut Winterfeld leading one
division In our days it is the finest of roads high level Pass of
good width across the Giant Range pleasant painted hamlets sprinkling
it fine mountain ridges and distant peaks looking on Schneekoppe
SNOWfell its head brightwhite till July come attends you far to

March we shall not give his junction with Bevern at Turnau on the
Iser April 24th then their capture of JungBunzlau Magazine and
crossing of the Elbe at Melnick these were the important points and
in spite of Konigsecks tusslings these all went well and nothing was
lost except one day of time

The Austrians some days ago as we observed filed THROUGH
PragSunday May 1st not a pleasant holidayspectacle to the
populationsand are all encamped on the Ziscaberg high ground on the
other side of the City Had they been alert now was the time to attack
Friedrich who is weaker than they while nobody has yet joined him
They did not think of it under Prince Karl and Browne and the Prince
are said to be in bad agreement




Chapter IIBATTLE OF PRAG

Monday morning 2d May 1757 the Vanguard or advanced troops of
Friedrichs Column had appeared upon the Weissenberg northwest corner
of Prag ground known to them in 1744 and to the poor WinterKing in
1620 Vanguard in the morning followed shortly by Friedrich himself
and hour after hour by all the others marching in So that before
sunset the whole force lay posted there and had the romantic City
of Prag full in view at their feet A most romantic highpiled
manytowered most unlevel old City its skylights and gilt
steeplecocks glittering in the western sunAustrian Camp very visible
close beyond it spread out miles in extent on the Ziscaberg Heights or
eastern sidePrag no doubt and the Austrian Garrison of Prag taking
intense survey of this Prussian phenomenon with commentaries with
emotions hidden now in eternal silence as is fit enough One thing we
know Headquarter was in Welleslawin there in that small Hamlet
nearly to north lodged Friedrich the then busiest man of Europe whom
Posterity is still striving for a view of as something memorable

Prince Karl our old friend is now in chief command yonder Browne also
is there who was in chief command their scheme of Campaign gone all
awry And to Friedrich last night at his quarters in the Monastery of
Tuchomirsitz where these two Gentlemen had lodged the night before
it was reported that they had been heard in violent altercation
_HeldenGeschichte _ iv 11 exact Diary of the march given
thereboth of them naturally in illhumor at the surprising turn
things had taken and Feldmarschall Browne firing up belike at
some platitude past or coming at some advice of his rejected some
imputation cast on him or we know not what Prince Karl is now chief
and indignant Browne as may well be the case dissents a good dealas
he has often had to do Patience my friend it is near ending now
Prince Karl means to lie quiet on the Ziscaberg and hold Prag does not
think of molesting Friedrich in his solitary state and will undertake
nothing till Konigseck from JungBunzlau come in victorious or
not or till perhaps even Daun arrive who is rather slowly gathering
reinforcement in Maren What can the enemy attempt on us in a Post of
this strength thinks Prince Karl And Browne whatever his insight or
convictions be has to keep silence

Weissenberg let readers be reminded is on the hither or western
side of Prag the Hradschin pronounce RadSHEEN with accent on the last
syllable as in SchwerIN and other such cases the Hradschin which
is the topmost summit of the City and of the Fashionable Quarterold
Bohemian Palace still occasionally habitable as such and in constant
use as a DOWNING STREETlies on the slope or shoulder of the
Weissenberg a good way from the top and has a web of streets rushing
down from it steepest streets in the world till they reach the Bridge
and broadflowing Moldau broad as Thames at halfflood but nothing
like so deep after which the streets become level and spread out in
intricate plenty to right and to left and ahead eastward across the
River till the Ziscaberg with frowning precipitous brow suddenly
puts a stop to them in that particular direction From Ziscaberg top to
Weissenberg top may be about five English miles from the Hradschin
to the foot of Ziscaberg northwest to southeast will be half that
distance the greatest length of Prag City Which is rather rhomboidal
in shape its longer diagonal this that we mention The shorter
diagonal from northmost base of Ziscaberg to southmost of Hradschin is
perhaps a couple of miles Prag stands nestled in the lap of mountains
and is not in itself a strong place in war but the country round
it Moldau ploughing his rugged chasm of a passage through the piled
tableland is difficult to manoeuvre in

Moldau Valley comes straight from the south crosses Prag andmaking
on its outgate at the northern end of Prag end of shortest diagonal
just spoken of one big loop or bend and counterbend of horseshoe
shape which will be notable to us anonagain proceeds straight
northward and Elbeward It is narrow everywhere especially when once
got fairly north of Prag and runs along like a QuasiHighland Strath
amid rocks and hills Big Hillranges not to be called barren yet with
rock enough on each hand and fine side valleys opening here and there
the bottom of your Strath which is green and fertile with pleasant
busy Villages much intent on waterpower and cottonspinning in our
time is generally of few furlongs in breadth And so it lasts this
pleasant Moldau Valley mile after mile on the northern or Lower
Moldau generally straight north though with one big bend eastward just
before ending and not till near Melnick or the mouth of Moldau do
we emerge on that grand Elbe Valleyglanced at once already from
Pascopol or other Height in the Lobositz times

Friedrichs first problem is the junction with Schwerin junction not
to be accomplished south of Ziscaberg in the present circumstances and
which Friedrich knows to be a ticklish operation with those Austrians
looking on from the high grounds there Tuesday 3d May in the way
of reconnoitring and decisively on Wednesday 4th Friedrich is off
northward along the western heights of Lower Moldau proper force
following him to seek a fit place for the pontoons and get across in
that northern quarter How dangerous that Schwerin is a day too late
murmurs he but hopes the Austrians will undertake nothing Keith
with 30000 he has left on the Weissenberg to straiten Prag and the
Austrian Garrison on that side our wagontrains arrive from Leitmeritz
on that side Elbeboats bring them up to Leitmeritz very indispensable
to guard that side of Prag Friedrichs fixed purpose also is to beat
the Austrians on the other side of it and send them packing but for
that there are steps needful

Up so far as Lissoley the first day Friedrich has found no fit place
but on the morrow Thursday 5th farther up at a place called Seltz
Friedrich finds his side of the Strath to be a little higher than the
otherproper therefore for cannonading the other if need beand
orders his pontoons to be built together there He knows accurately of
the Schwerin Column of the comfortable Bevern Victory at Reichenberg
and how they have got the JungBunzlau Magazine and are across the
Elbe their bridges all secured though with delay of one day and do
now wait only for the wordfor the three cannonshot in fact which
are to signify that Friedrich is actually crossing to their side of
Lower Moldau

Friedrichs Bridge is speedily built trained human hands can be no
speedier his batteries planted his precautions taken the three
cannonshot go off audible to Schwerin and Friedrichs troops stream
speedily across hardly a Pandour to meddle with them Nay before the
passage was completewhat lighthorse squadrons are these Hussars
seen to be Seidlitzs missioned by Schwerin appear on the outskirts
a meeting worthy of three cheers surely after such a march on both
sides Friedrich lies on the eastern Hilltops that night Hamlet of
Czimitz his Headquarter discoverable if you wish it scarcely three
miles north of Prag and accurate appointment is made with Schwerin
as to the meetingplace tomorrow morning Meetingplace is to be the
environs of Prossik Village southeastward over yonder short way north
of the PragKonigsgratz Highway and rather nearer Prag than we now
are in Czimitz here time at Prossik to be 6 AM by the clock and
Winterfeld and Schwerin to come in person and speak with his Majesty
This is the program for Friday May 6th which proves to be so memorable
a day

Schwerin is on foot by the stroke of midnight comes along over the
heights of Chaber by half a dozen or I know not how many roads
visible in due time to Friedrichs people who are likewise punctually
on the advance in a word the junction is accomplished with all
correctness And while the Columns are marching up Schwerin and
Winterfeld ride about in personal conference with his Majesty taking
survey through spyglasses of those Austrians encamped yonder on the
broad back of their Zisca Hill a couple of miles to southward What a
set of Austrians exclaim military critics to permit such junction
without effort to devour the one half or the other in good time
Friedrich himself it is probable might partly be of the same opinion
but he knew his Austrians and had made bold to venture Friedrich we
can observe always got to know his man after fighting him a month or
two and took liberties with him or did not take accordingly And
for most partnot quite always as one signal exception will Showhe
does it with perfect accuracy and often with vital profit to his
measures If the Austrian cookingtents are asmoke before eight in the
morning notes he you may calculate in such case the Austrians will
march that day MILITARY INSTRUCTIONS With a surprising vividness of
eye and mind beautiful to rival if one could he watches the signs of
the times of the hours and the days and the places and prophesies from
them reads men and their procedures as if they were mere handwriting
not too cramp for himThe Austrians have by this time got their
Konigseck home very unvictorious but still on foot all but a thousand
or two they are already stronger than the Prussians by count of
heads and till even Daun come up what hurry in a Post like this The
Austrians are viewing Friedrich too this morning but in the blankest
manner their outposts fire a cannonshot or two on his group of
adjutants and him without effect and the Head people send their
cavalry out to forage so little prophecy have they from signs seen

Zisca Hill where the Austrians now are rises sheer up of wellnigh
precipitous steepness though there are trees and grass on it from
the eastern side of Prag say five or six hundred feet A steep
picturesque massive green Hill Moldau River turning suddenly to
right strikes the northwest corner of it has flowed well to west of
it till then and winds eastward round its northern base As will
be noticed presently The ascent of Ziscaberg by roads is steep and
tedious but once at the top you find that it is precipitous on two
sides only the City or westward side and the Moldau or northward
Atop it spreads out far and wide into a waving upland level bare
of hedges ploughable all of it studded with littery hamlets and
farmsteadings far and wide a kind of Plain sloping with extreme
gentleness five or six miles to eastward and as far to southward
before the level perceptibly rise again

Another feature of the Ziscaberg already hinted at is very notable
that of the Moldau skirting its northern base and scarping the Hill
on that side too into a precipitous or very steep condition Moldau
having arrived from southward fairly past the end of Ziscaberg had
so to speak made up his mind to go right eastward quarrying his way
through the lower uplands there And he proceeds accordingly hugging
the northern base of Ziscaberg and making it steep enough but finds
in the course of a mile or so that he can no more upland being still
rockbuilt not underminable farther and so is obliged to wind round
again to northward and finally straight westward the way he came
or parallel to the way he came and has effected that great Horseshoe
Hollow we heard of lately An extremely pretty Hollow and curious to
look upon pretty villas gardens and a Belvedere Park laid out in
the bottom part with green mountainwalls rising all round it and a
silver ring of river at the base of them length of Horseshoe from
heel to toe or from west to east is perhaps a mile breadth from heel
to heel perhaps half as much Having arrived at his old distance
to west Moldau like a repentant prodigal and as if ashamed of his
frolic just over against the old point he swerved from takes straight
to northward again Straight northward and quarries out that fine
narrow valley or QuasiHighland Strath with its pleasant busy
villages where he turns the overshot machinery and where Friedrich and
his men had their pontoons swimming yesterday

It is here on this broad back of the Ziscaberg that the Austrians now
lie looking northward over to the King and trying cannonshots
upon him There they have been encamping and diligently intrenching
themselves for four days past diligent especially since yesterday when
they heard of Friedrichs crossing the River Their groups of tents
and batteries at all the good points stretch from near the crown of
Ziscaberg eastward to the Villages of Hlaupetin Kyge and their
Lakes near four miles and rearward into the interior one knows not how
farPrince Karl hardly awake yet lies at Nussel near the Moldau
near the Wischerad or southeastmost point of Prag six good miles
westbysouth of Kyge at the other end of the diagonal line About the
same distance right east from Nussel and a mile or more to south of
Kyge over yonder is a littery Farmstead named Sterbohol which is
not yet occupied by the Austrians but will become very famous in their
WarAnnals this day

Where the Austrian Camp or various Tentgroups were at the time
Friedrich first cast eye on them is no great concern of his or ours
inasmuch as in two or three hours hence the Austrians were obliged
rather suddenly to take Order of Battle and that and not their
camping is the thing we are curious upon Let us step across and take
some survey of that Austrian ground which Friedrich is now surveying
from the distance fully intending that it shall be a battleground in
few hours and try to explain how the Austrians drew up on it when they
noticed the Prussian symptoms to become serious more and more By nine
in the morningsome two hours after Friedrich began his scanning and
the Austrian outposts their firing of stray cannonshots on himit is
Battlelines not empty Tents which there was not time to strike that
salute the eye over yonder

From behind that verdant Horseshoe Chasm we spoke of buttressed by
the inaccessible steeps and the Moldau doublefolded in the form of
Horseshoe all along the brow of that sloping expanse stands by 9
AM foragers all suddenly called in the Austrian front the second
line and the reserve parallel to it at good distances behind Ranked
there say 65000 regulars Prussian force little short of the same
on the brow of Ziscaberg slope some four miles long Their right wing
ends in strong batteries in intricate marshes knolls lakelets
between Hlaupetin and Kyge the extreme of their left wing looks over on
that Horseshoe Hollow where Moldau tried to dig his way but could not
and had to turn back They have numerous redoubts in front and in all
the good places and are busy with more some of them just now getting
finished treblequick while the Prussians are seen under way As many
as sixty heavy cannon in battery up and down of fieldpieces they
have a hundred and fifty Excellent always with their Artillery these
Austrians plenty of it wellplaced and wellserved thanks to Prince
Lichtensteins fine labors within these ten years past _OEuvres
de Frederic_ in several places see Hormayr Lichtenstein The
villages the farmsteads are occupied every rising ground especially
has its batteryHomoly Berg Tabor Berg Mount of Tabor say
KNOLL of Tabor nothing like so high as Battersea Rise hardly even
as Constitution Hill though scriptural Zisca would make a Mount of
itthese and other BERGS of the like type

That is the Austrian Battle Order as it stood about 9 though it had
still to change a little as we shall see their first line straight
or nearly so looking northward stands on the brow of the Zisca Slope
their second and their third singularly like it at the due distances
behindin the intervals their tents which stand scattered in groups
wide apart in the ample interior to southward The cavalry is on
both wings left wing behind that Moldau Chasm cannot attack nor be
attackedexcept it were on hippogriffs and its enemy on the
like capable of fighting in the air overhead of these Belvedere
Pleasuregrounds perhaps Prince Karl will remedy this oversight fruit
of close following of the orthodox practice Prince Karl supreme Chief
commands on the left wing Browne on the right where he can attack or
be attacked NOT on hippogriffs As we shall see and others will Light
horse in any quantity hang scattered on all outskirts With foot with
cannon batteries with horse light or heavy they cover in long broad
flood the whole of that Zisca Slope to near where it ceases and the
ground to eastward begins perceptibly to rise again

In this latter quarter Zisca Slope now nearly ended begins to get
very swampy in parts on the eastern border of the Austrian Camp at
Kyge Hostawitz and beyond it southward about Sterbohol and Michelup
there are many little lakelets artificial fishponds several of them
with their sluices dams and apparatus a ragged broadish lacing of
ponds and lakelets all well dried in our day straggles and zigzags
along there connected by the miserablest Brook in nature which takes
to oozing and serpentizing forward thereabouts and does finally get
emptied now in a rather livelier condition into the Moldau about the
TOEpart of that Horseshoe or Belvedere region It runs in sight of the
King I think where he now is this lower livelier part of it little
does the King know how important the upper oozing portion of it will
be to him this day Near Michelup are lakelets worth noticing a little
under Sterbohol in the course of this miserable Brook is a string of
fishponds with their sluices open at this time the water out and
the mud bottom sown with herbprovender for the intended carps which
is coming on beautifully green as leeks and nearly ready for the fish
getting to it again

Friedrich surveys diligently what he can of all this from the northern
verge We will now return to Friedrich and will stay on his side
through the terrible Action that is coming Battle of Prag one of the
furious Battles of the World loud as Doomsdaythe very Emblem of
which done on the Piano by females of energy scatters mankind to
flight who love their ears Of this great Action the Narratives old and
modern are innumerable false some of them unintelligible wellnigh
all There are three in Lloyd known probably to some of my readers
Tempelhof with criticisms of these three gives a fourthperhaps the
one Narrative which human nature after much study can in some sort
understand Human readers especially military I refer to that as their
finale In Lloyd i 38 et seq the Three in Tempelhof i 123

CadetSchoolsappears to possess the fit professorial lucidity and
amplitude and in regard to all Official details enumerations and the
like is received as of CANONICAL authority it is not accessible to
the general Publicthough liberally enough conceded in special cases
whereby in effect the main results of it are now become current in
modern Prussian Books By favor in high quarters I had once possession
of a copy for some months but not at that time the possibility
of thoroughly reading any part of it Other interest than
militaryscientific the Action now has not much The stormy fire of soul
that blazed that day higher in no ancient or modern Fight of men is
extinct hopeless of resuscitation for English readers Approximately
what the thing to human eyes might be like what Friedrichs procedure
humor and physiognomy of soul was in it this especially the latter
head is what we search forhad lazy Dryasdust given us almost
anything on this latter head What little can be gleaned from him
on both heads let us faithfully give and finish our sad part of the
combat

Friedrich with his Schwerin and Winterfeld surveying these things
from the northern edge admits that the Austrian position is extremely
strong but he has no doubt that it must be by some good method
attacked straightway and the Austrians got beaten Indisputably the
enterprise is difficult Unattackable clearly the Austrians on that
left wing of theirs not in the centre well attackable nor in the
front at all with that stiff ground and such redoubts and points of
strength but round on their right yonder take them in flankcannot
we On as far as Kyge the Three have ridden reconnoitring and found
no possibility upon the front nor at Kyge where the front ends in
batteries pools and quagmires is there any Difficult not undoable
persists the King and it must be straightway set about and got done
Winterfeld always for action is of that opinion too and examining
farther down along their right flank reports that there the thing is
feasible

Feasible perhaps but straightway objects Schwerin His men have been
on foot since midnight and on forced marches for days past were it not
better to rest for this one day Restand Daun coming on with 30000
of reinforcement to them might arrive this night Never my good
Feldmarschalland as the Feldmarschall was a man of stiff notions
and had a tongue of some emphasis the Dialogue went on probably with
increasing emphasis on Friedrichs side too till old Schwerin with
a quite emphatic flash of countenance crushing the hat firm over his
brow exclaims Well your Majesty the fresher fish the better fish
FRISCHE FISCHE GUTE FISCHE straightway then and springs off on
the gallop southward he too seeking some likely point of attack
He tooconjointly or not with Winterfeld I do not know Winterfeld
himself does not say whose own modest words on the subject readers
shall see before we finish But both are mentioned in the Books as
searching at handgallop in this way and both once well round to
south by the Podschernitz Podschernitz is pronounced PotSHERnitz
should we happen to mentionn it again Kyge KEEGA quarter with
the Austrian right flank full in view were agreed that here the thing
was possible Infantry to push from this quarter towards Sterbohol
yonder and then plunge into their redoubts and them Cavalry may sweep
still farther southward if found convenient and even take them in
rear Both agree that it will do in this way ground tolerably good
slightly downwards for us then slightly upwards again tolerable for
horse eventhe intermediate lacing of dirty lakelets the fishponds
with their sluices drawn Schwerin and Winterfeld either did not notice
at all or thought them insiginificant interspersed with such beautiful
pasturegroundof unusual verdure at this early season of the year

The deployment or marching up AUFMARSCHIREN of the Prussians
was wonderful in their squadrons in their battalions horse
foot artillery wheeling closing opening strangely checkering a
countrysidein movements intricate chaotic to all but the scientific
eye Conceive them flowing along from the Heights of Chaber behind
Prossik Hamlet right wing of infantry plants itself at Prossik horse
westward of them and ever onwards in broad manycheckered tidestream
eastward eastward then southward our artillery went through
Podschernitz the foot and horse a little on this westward side of it
intricate manyglancing tide of coming battle which swift correct
as clockwork becomes two lines from Prossik to near Chwala baggage
well behind at Gbell thence round by Podschernitz quarter and
descends steady swift tornadostorm so beautifully hidden in it
towards Sterbohol there to grip to Gradually in stirring up those old
dead pedantic recordbooks the fact rises on us silent whirlwinds
of old PlattDeutsch fire beautifully held down dwell in those mute
masses better human stuff there is not than that old Teutsch Dutch
English PlattDeutsch and other varieties and so disciplined as here
it never was before or since In an hour and half what military men
may count almost incredible they are fairly on their ground motionless
the most of them by 9 AM the rest wheeling rightward as they
successively arrive in the ChwalaPodschernitz localities and
descending diligently Sterbohol way and will be at their harvestwork
anon

Meanwhile the Austrians seeing to their astonishment these phenomena
to the north and that it is a quite serious thing do also rapidly
bestir themselves swarming like beesbringing in their foraging
Cavalry No time to change your jacket for a coat rank doublequick
Browne is on that right wing of theirs Bring the left wing over
hither suggests Browne cavalry is useless yonder unless they had
hippogriffsand again Browne suggesting the Austrians make a change
in the position of their right wing both horse and foot change which
is of vital importance though unnoted in many Narratives of this
Battle Seeing namely what the Prussians intend they wheel their
right wing say the last furlong or two of their long Line of Battle
half round to right so that the last furlong or two stands at right
angles EN POTENCE gallowswise or joinerssquarewise to the
rest and in this way make front to the Prussian onslaughtfront
now not flank as the Prussians are anticipating This is an important
wheel to right and formation in joinerssquare manner and involves no
end of interior wheeling marching and deploying which Austrians cannot
manage with Prussian velocity Swift with it here about Sterbohol
at least my men For here are the Prussians within wind of us urges
Browne And here straightway the hurricane does break loose

Winterfeld the van of Schwerins infantry Schwerins own regiment
and some others with him is striding rapidly on Sterbohol Winterfeld
catches it before Browne can But near by behind that important
post on the Homely Hill BERG or Mountain nothing like so high as
Constitution Mountain are cannonbatteries of devouring quality which
awaken on Winterfeld as he rushes out doublequick on the advancing
Austrians and are fatal to Winterfelds attempt and nearly to
Winterfeld himself Winterfeld heavily wounded sank in swoon from his
horse and awakening again in a pool of blood found his men all off
rushing back upon the main Schwerin body Austrian grenadiers gazing on
the thing about eighty paces off not venturing to follow Winterfeld
half dead scrambled across to Schwerin who has now come up with the
main body his front line fronting the Austrians here And there
ensued about Sterbohol and neighborhood led on by Schwerin such a
deathwrestle as was seldom seen in the Annals of War Winterfelds miss
of Sterbohol was the beginning of it the exact course of sequel none
can describe though the end is well known

The Austrians now hold Sterbohol with firm grip backed by those
batteries from Homoly Hill Redoubts cannonbatteries as we said
stud all the field the Austrian stock of artillery is very great
arrangement of it cunning practice excellent does honor to Prince
Lichtenstein and indeed is the real force of the Austrians on this
occasion Schwerin must have Sterbohol in spite of batteries and ranked
Austrians and Winterfelds recoil tumbling round himand rarely had
the oldest veteran such a problem Old Schwerin fiery as ever at the
age of 73 has been in many battles from Blenheim onwards and now has
got to his hottest and his last Vanguard could not do it main body
we hope kindling all the hotter perhaps may A most willing mind is
in these Prussians of Schwerins fatigue of overmarching has tired
the muscles of them but their heartsall witnesses say these and
through these their very muscles always fresh again after a few
minutes of breathingtime were beyond comparison this day

Schwerins Prussians as they march up that is as they front and
advance upon the Austrians are everywhere saluted by caseshot from
Homoly Hill and the batteries northward of Homoly but march on this
main line of them finely regardless of it or of Winterfelds disaster
by it The general Prussian Order this day is By push of bayonet
no firing none at any rate till you see the whites of their eyes
Swift steady as on the paradeground swiftly making up their gaps
again the Prussians advance on these terms and are now near those
fine sleek pasturegrounds unusually green for the season Figure the
actual stepping upon these fine pasturegroundsmudtanks verdant
with mere bearding oatcrop sown there as carpprovender Figure the
sinking of whole regiments to the knee to the middle some of them the
steady march become a wild sprawl through viscous mud mere caseshot
singing round you tearing you away at its ease Even on those terrible
terms the Prussians by dams by footpaths sometimes one man abreast
sprawl steadily forward trailing their cannon with them only a few
regiments in the footpath parts cannot bring their cannon Forward
rank again when the ground will carry ever forward the caseshot
getting ever more murderous No human pen can describe the deadly chaos
which ensued in that quarter Which lasted in desperate fury issue
dubious for above three hours and was the crisis or essential agony
of the Battle Footchargings once the mudtransit was accomplished
under storms of grapeshot from Homoly Hill by and by Horsechargings
Prussian against Austrian southward of Homoly and Sterbohol
still farther to the Prussian left huge whirlpool of tumultuous
deathwrestle every species of spasmodic effort on the one side
and the otherKing himself present there as I dimly discover
Feldmarschall Browne eminent in the last of his fields and as the old
NIEBELUNGEN has it a murder grim and great going on

Schwerins Prussians in that preliminary struggle through the mudtanks
which Winterfeld I think had happened to skirt and avoid were hard
bested This so far as I can learn was the worst of the chaos this
preliminary part Intolerable to human nature this or nearly so even
to human nature of the PlattTeutsch type improved by Prussian drill
Winterfelds repulse we saw Schwerins own Regiment in it Various
repulses I perceive there werefresh regiments from our Second
Line storming in thereupon till the poor repulsed people took
breath repented and themselves stormed in again say the Books
Fearful tugging swagging and swaying is conceivable in this Sterbohol
problem And after long scanning I rather judge it was in the wake of
that first repulse and not of some other farther on that the veteran
Schwerin himself got his death No one times it for us but the fact is
unforgettable and in the dim whirl of sequences dimly places itself
there Very certain it is at sight of his own regiment in retreat
Feldmarschall Schwerin seized the colorsas did other Generals who
are not named that day Seizes the colors fiery old man HERAN MEINE
KINDER This way my sons and rides ahead along the straight dam
again his sons all turning and with hot repentance following On
my children HERAN Five bits of grapeshot deadly each of them at
once hit the old man dead he sinks there on his flag and will never
fight more HERAN storm the others with hot tears Adjutant von
Platen takes the flag Platen too is instantly shot but another
takes it HERAN On in wild storm of rage and griefin a word
they manage to do the work at Sterbohol they and the rest First line
Second line Infantry Cavalry and even the very Horses I suppose
fighting inexpressibly conquering one of the worst problems ever seen
in War For the Austrians too especially their grenadiers there stood
to it toughly and fought like menand every grenadier that survived
of them as I read afterwards got double pay for life

Done that Sterbohol workthose Footchargings Horsechargings that
battery of Homoly Hill and hanging upon that all manner of redoubts
and batteries to the rightward and rearwardbut how it was done no
pen can describe nor any intellect in clear sequence understand An
enormous MELEE there new Prussian battalions charging and ever new
irrepressible by caseshot as they successively get up Marshal Browne
too sending for new battalions at doublequick from his left disputing
stiffly every inch of his ground Till at length hour not given a
cannonshot tore away his foot and he had to be carried into Prag
mortally wounded Which probably was a most important circumstance or
the most important of all

Important too I gradually see was that of the Prussian Horse of the
Left Wing Prussian Horse of the extreme left as already noticed had
in the mean while fallen in well southward round by certain lakelets
about Michelup on Brownes extreme right furiously charging the
Austrian Horse which stood ranked there in many lines breaking it
then again half broken by it but again rallying charging it a second
time then a third time both to front and flank amid whirlwinds
of dust Ziethen busy there not to mention indignant Warnery and
othersand at length driving it wholly to the winds beyond Nussel
towards the Sazawa Country never seen again that day Prince Karl
after Brownes deathwound or before I never know came galloping
to rally that important Right Wing of horse Prince Karl did his very
utmost there obtesting praying raging threateningbut to no
purpose the Zietheners and others so heavy on the rear of themand at
last there came a cramp or intolerable twinge of spasm through Prince
Karls own person breast or heart like to take the life of him so
that he too had to be carried into Prag to the doctors And his Cavalry
fled at discretion chased by Ziethen on Friedrichs express order and
sent quite over the horizon Enough by about halfpast one Sterbohol
work is thoroughly done and the Austrian Battle both its Commanders
gone has heeled fairly downwards and is in an ominous way

The whole of this Austrian Right Wing horse and foot batteries and
redoubts which was put EN POTENCE or squarewise to the main battle
is become a ruin gone to confusion hovers in distracted clouds
seeking roads to run away by which it ultimately found Done all this
surely was and poor Browne mortally wounded is being carried off
the ground but in what sequence done under what exact vicissitudes
of aspect special steps of cause and effect no man can say and only
imagination guided by these few data can paint to itself Such a
chaotic whirlwind of blood dust mud artillerythunder sulphurous
rage and human death and victorywho shall pretend to describe it or
draw except in the gross the scientific plan of it

For in the mean timeI think while the dispute at Sterbohol on the
extreme of the Austrian right wing in joinerssquare form was past
the hottest but nobody will give the hourthere has occurred
another thing much calculated to settle that And indeed to settle
everythingas it did This was a volunteer exploit upon the very
elbow or angle of said joinerssquare in the wet grounds between
Hlaupetin and Kyge a good way north of Sterbohol Volunteer exploit on
the part of General Mannstein our old Russian friend which Friedrich
a long way off from it blames as a rash fault of Mannsteins made good
by Prince Henri and Ferdinand of Brunswick running up to mend it but
which Winterfeld and subsequent good judges admit to have been highly
salutary and to have finished everything It went if I read right
somewhat as follows

In the KygeHlaupetin quarter at the corner of that Austrian right
wing EN POTENCE there had much contrary to Brownes intention a
perceptible gap occurred the corner is open there nothing in it but
batteries and swamps The Austrian right wing wheeling southward there
to form POTENCE and scrambling and marching then and subsequently
through such ground at doublequick had gone too far had thinned and
lengthened itself as is common in such scrambling and doublequick
movement thinks Tempelhof and left a little gap at elbow which
always rather widened as the stress at Sterbohol went on Certain
enough a gap there is covered only by some halfmoon battery in
advance into this General Mannstein has been looking wistfully a long
time Austrian Line fallen out at elbow yonder clouted by some battery
in advanceand at length cannot help dashing loose on it with
his Division A man liable to be rash and always too impetuous in
battletime

He would have fared ill thinks Friedrich had not Henri and Ferdinand
in pain for Mannstein some think privately in preconcert with
him hastened in to help and done it altogether in a shining way
surmounting perilous difficulties not a few Hard fighting in that
corner partly on the Sterbohol terms batteries mudtanks chargings
rechargings Comrades you have got honor enough KAMERADEN IHR HABT
EHRE GENUG the second man of you lying dead let us now try said a
certain Regiment to a certain other in this business Archenholtz i
75 Tempelhof c Prince Henri shone especially the gallant little
gentleman coming upon one of those mudtanks with battery beyond his
men were spreading filewise to cross it on the dams BURSCHE this
way cried the Prince and plunged in middledeep right upon the
battery and over it and victoriously took possession of it In a word
they all plunge forward in a shining manner rush on those halfmoon
batteries regardless of results rush over them seize and secure them
Rush in a word fairly into that Austrian holeatelbow torrents more
following themand irretrievably ruin both forearm and shoulderarm
of the Austrians thereby

Forearm Austrian right wing if still struggling and wriggling about
Sterbohol is taken in flank shoulderarm or main line the like
we have them both in flank with their own batteries to scour them to
destruction herethe Austrian Line throughout is become a ruin
Has to hurl itself rapidly to rightwards to rearwards says Tempelhof
behind what redoubts and strong points it may have in those parts and
then by sure stages Tempelhof guesses three or perhaps four as one
redoubt after another is torn from the loose grasp of it and the stand
made becomes ever weaker and the confusion worseto roll pellmell
into Prag and hastily close the door behind it The Prussians
Sterbohol people MannsteinHenri people left wing and right are quite
across the Zisca Back on by Nussel Prince Earls headquarter that
was and at the Moldau Brink again when the thing ends Ziethens
Hussars have been at Nussel very busy plundering there ever since that
final charge and chase from Sterbohol Plundering and I am ashamed
to say mostly drunk Your Majesty I cannot rank a hundred sober
answered Ziethen doubtless with a kind of blush when the King applied
for them The King himself has got to Branik farther up stream Part
of the Austrian foot fled leftwards southwards as their right wing
of horse had all done up the Moldau About 16000 Austrians are
distractedly on flight that way Towards the Sazawa Country to unite
with Daun as the now advisable thing Near 40000 of them are getting
crammed into Prag in spite of Prince Karl now recovered of his cramp
and risen to the frantic pitch who vainly struggles at the Gate
against such inrush and had even got through the Gate conjuring and
commanding but was himself swum in again by those panic torrents of
ebbtide

Rallying within he again attempted twice over at two different
points to get out and up the Moldau with his broken people but the
Prussians NusselBranik way were awake to him No retreat up the
Moldau for you Austrian gentlemen They tried by another Gate on the
other side of the River but Keith was awake too In again ye Austrian
gentlemen Closed gates here too What else Browne from his bed of
pain deathbed as it proved was for a much more determined outrush
In the dead of night rank deliberately adjust yourselves storm out
one and all and cut your way night favoring That was Brownes last
counsel but that also was not taken A really noble Browne say all
judges died here in about six weeksand got away from KriegsHofraths
and Prince Karls and the stupidity of neighbors and the other ills
that flesh is heir to altogether

At Branik the victorious King had one great disappointment Prince
Moritz of Dessau who should have been here long hours ago with Keiths
right wing a fresh 15000 to fall upon the enemys rearno Moritz
visible not even now when the business is to chase How is this Ill
luck your Majesty Moritzs Pontoon Bridge would not reach across
when he tried it That is certain just three poor pontoons wanting
Rumor saysthree or more spoiled I am told in some narrow road
some shortcut which Moritz had commanded for them and now they are
not and it is as if three hundred had been spoiled Moritz would
he die for it cannot get his Bridge to reach his fresh 15000 stand
futile there not even Seidlitz with his light horse could really swim
across though he tried hard and is fabled to have done so Beware of
shortcuts my Prince your Father that is gone what would he say of
you here It was the worst mistake Prince Moritz ever made The Austrian
Army might have been annihilated say judges of a sanguine temper had
Moritz been ready at his hour to fall on from rearwardand where had
their retreat been As it is the Austrian Army is not annihilated only
bottled into Prag and will need sieging The brightest triumph has
a bar of black in it and might always have been brighter Here is a
flying Note which I will subjoin

Friedrichs dispositions for the Battle this day are allowed to have
been masterly but there was one signal fault thinks Retzow That
he did not as Schwerin counselled wait till the morrow Fault which
brought many in the train of it that of his tired soldiers says
Retzow being only a first item and small in comparison Had he waited
till the morrow those fishponds of Sterbohol examined in the interim
need not have been mistaken for green meadows Prince Moritz with his
15000 would have been a fact instead of a false hope the King might
have done his marching down upon Sterbohol in the nighttime and been
ready for the Austrians flank or even rear at daybreak the King
mightIn reality this fault seems to have been considerable to have
made the victory far more costly to him and far less complete No doubt
he had his reasons for making haste Daun advancing Pragward with
30000 was within three marches of him General Beck Dauns vanguard
with a 10000 of irregulars did a kind of feat at Brandeis on the
Prussian post there our Saxons deserting to him in the heat of
action this very day May 6th and might if lucky have taken part at
Ziscaberg next day And besides these solid reasons there was perhaps
another Retzow who is secretly of the Oppositionparty and well worth
hearing knows personally a curious thing He says

Being then in March or April weeks before we left Saxony employed to
translate the PLAN OF OPERATIONS into French for Marshal Keiths
use who did not understand German I well know that it contained the
following three main objects 1 All Regiments cantoning in Silesia as
well as Saxony march for Bohemia on one and the same day 2 Whole Army
arrives at Prag May 4th Schwerin was a day later and got scolded in
consequence if the Enemy stand he is attacked May 6th and beaten
3 So soon as Prag is got Schwerin with the gross of the Army pushes
into Mahren and the heart of Austria itself King hastens with 40000
to help of the Allied ArmyRoyal Highness of Cumberlands who will
much need it by that time Retzow i 84 n

Here is a very curious fact and consideration That the King had so
prophesied and preordained May 4th Four Columns arrive at Prag May
6th attack the Austrians beat themand now wished to keep his word
This is an aerial reason which I can suspect to have had its weight
among others There were twirls of that kind in Friedrich intricate
weak places knots in the sound straightfibred mind he had as in
whose mind are they notwhich now and then cost him dear The
AnecdoteBooks say he was very ill of body that day May 6th and
called for something of drug nature and swallowed it drug not named
after getting on horseback The Evening Anecdote is prettier How in
the rushing about Austrians now flying he got eye on Brother Henri
clayey to a degree and sat down with him in the blessed sunset for
a minute or two and bewailed his sad losses of Schwerin and others

Certain it is the victory was bought by hard fighting and but for
the quality of his troops had not been there But the bravery of the
Prussians was exemplary and covered all mistakes that were made Nobler
fire when did it burn in any Army More perfect soldiers I have
not read of PlattTeutsch firewhich I liken to anthracite in
contradistinction to Gaelic blaze of kindled strawis thrice noble
when by strict stern discipline you are above it withal and wield
your fireelement as Jove his thunder by rule Otherwise it is but
halfadmirable TurkJanissaries have it otherwise and it comes to
comparatively little

This is the famed Battle of Prag fought May 6th 1757 which sounded
through all the worldand used to deafen us in drawingrooms within
mans memory Results of it were On the Prussian side killed wounded
and missing 12500 men on the Austrian 13000 prisoners included
with many flags cannon tents much wargear gone the wrong roadand
a very great humiliation and dispiritment though they had fought well
No longer the old Austrians by any means as Friedrich sees but have
iron ramrods all manner of Prussian improvements and are learning to
march as he once says with surprise not quite pleasant

Friedrich gives the cipher of loss on both sides much higher This
Battle says he which began towards nine in the morning and lasted
chase included till eight at night was one of the bloodiest of the
age The Enemy lost 24000 men of whom were 5000 prisoners the
Prussian loss amounted to 18000 fighting menwithout counting Marshal
Schwerin who alone was worth above 10000 This day saw the pillars
of the Prussian Infantry cut down says he mournfully seeming almost
to think the laurels of victory were purchased too dear His account
of the Battle as if it had been a painful object rather avoided in
his afterthoughts is unusually indistinctand helps us little in the
extreme confusion that reigns otherwise both in the thing itself and in
the reporters of the thing Here is a word from Winterfeld some private
Letter two days after which is well worth reading for those who would
understand this Battle

The enemy had his Left Wing leaning on the City close by the Moldau
at Nussel and stretched with his Right Wing across the high Hill of
Zisca to the village of Lieben so he HAD stood looking into Prag
but faced about on hearing that Friedrich was across the River having
before him those terrible Defiles DIE TERRIBLEN DEFILEES Horseshoe
of the Moldau as we call it and the village of Prossik which was
crammed with Pandours It was about halfpast six in the morning when
our Schwerin Army myself part of it at this time joined with the
twenty battalions and twenty squadrons which the King had brought
across to unite with us and which formed our right wing of battle that
day our left wing were Schweriners Sterbohol and the fighting done by
Schweriners after their long march The King was at once determined to
attack the Enemy as also were Schwerin say nothing of the arguing and
your humble servant MEINE WENIGKEIT but the first thing was to find
a hole whereby to get at him

This too was selected and decided on my proposal being found good
and took effect in manner following We Schweriners had marched off
leftwise foremost and we now without halt continued marching so
with the Left Wing of horse which had the van TETE and moved on
keeping the road for Hlaupetin and ever thence onwards along for Kyge
round the Ponds of UnterPodschernitz without needing to pass these
and so as to get them in our rear

The Enemy who at first had expected nothing bad and never supposed
that we would attack him at once FLAGRANTE DELICTO and least of all in
this point and did not believe it possible as we should have to wade
breastdeep in part through the ditches and drag our cannonwas at
first quite tranquil But as he began to perceive our real design in
which they say Prince Karl was the first to open Marshal Brownes
eyes he drew his whole Cavalry over towards us as fast as it could
be done and stretched them out as Right Wing to complete which his
Grenadiers and Hungarian Regulars of Foot ranked themselves as they
got up makes his POTENCE HAKEN or joinerssquare outmost end of it
Horse

The Enemys intention was to hold with the Right Wing of his infantry
on the Farmstead which they call Sterbaholy Sterbohol a very dirty
Farmstead at this day I however had the good luck plunging on head
foremost with six battalions of our Left Wing and two of the Flank to
get to it before him Although our Second Line was not yet come forward
yet as the battalions of the First were tolerably well together I
decided with General Fouquet who had charge of the Flank to begin
at once and that the Enemy might not have time to post himself still
better I pushed forward quick step out of the Farmstead of Sterbohol
to meet himso fast that even our cannon had not time to follow He
did accordingly begin to waver and I could observe that his people
here on this Wing were making rightabout

Meanwhile his fire of caseshot opened from Homoly Hill on our
left and we were still pushing onmight now be about two hundred
steps from the Enemys Line when I had the misfortune at the head of
Regiment Schwerin to get wounded and swooning away VOR TOD fell
from my horse to the ground Awakening after some minutes and raising
my head to look about I found nobody of our people now here beside or
round me but all were already behind in full flood of retreat HOCH
ANSCHLAGEN The Enemys Grenadiers were perhaps eighty paces from me
but had halted and had not the confidence to follow us I struggled to
my feet as fast as for weakness I possibly could and got up to our
confused mass CONFUSEN KLUMPENexact place where but could not
by entreaties or by threats persuade a single man of them to turn his
face on the Enemy much less to halt and try again

In this embarrassment the deceased Feldmarschall found me and noticed
that the blood was flowing streamwise from my neck As I was on foot
and none of my people now near he bade give me his led horse which he
still had and sent me home for surgery Winterfeld handsomely effacing
himself when no longer good for anything hurries on to the Catastrophe
leaving us to guess that he was NOT an eyewitness fartherbade
give me the led horse which he still had AND as if that had happened
directly after which surely it did not AND snatched the flag from
Captain Rohr who had taken it up to make the Bursche turn and rode
forward with it himself But before he could succeed in the attempt
this excellent man almost in a minute was hit with five caseshot
balls and fell dead on the ground as also his brave Adjutant von
Platen was so wounded that he died next day

During this confusion and repulse by which as already mentioned the
Enemy had not the heart to profit not only was our Second Line come on
but those of the First who had not suffered went vigorously FRISCH
at the Enemyand in course of time perhaps two hours yet and by
dint of effort we did manage Sterbohol and its batteriesLike as
still in one sentence and without the least punctuation Winterfeld
being little of a grammarian and in haste for the close Like as
Prince Henris Royal Highness with our Right Wing Mannstein and he
without waiting for order attacked so PROMPT and with such FERMOTE
in that elbowhole far north of US that everywhere the Enemys Line
began to give way and instead of continuing as Line sought corpswise
to gain the Heights and there post itself And as without winning
said Heights we could not win the Battle we had to storm them all one
after the other and this it was that cost us the best most and bravest
people

The late Colonel von Goltz if we glance back to Sterbohol itself
who with the regiment Fouquet was advancing righthand of Schwerin
regiment and your servant had likewise got quite close to the Enemy
and had he not at the very instant when he was levelling bayonets been
shot down I think that he with myself and the Schwerin regiment would
have got inand perhaps have there done the job special and general
with much less expense and sooner Preuss ii 4547 in Winterfelds
hand dated Camp at Prag 8th May 1757 addressed to one knows not
whom first printed by Preuss

This is what we get from Winterfeld a rugged not much grammatical man
but as I can perceive with excellent eyes in his head and interior
talent for twenty grammatical people had that been his line These
faithfully rendered here without change but of pointing are the
only words I ever saw of his to my regretwhich surely the Prussian
Dryasdust might still amend a littlein respect of so distinguished
a person and chosen Peer of Friedrichs This his brief theory of Prag
Battle if intensely read I find to be of a piece with his practice
there

Schwerin was much lamented in the Army and has been duly honored ever
since His body lies in Schwerinsburg at home far away his Monument
finale of a series of Monuments stands now under special guardianship
near Sterbohol on the spot where he fell A late Tourist says

At first there was a monument of wood TREE planted I will hope
which is now all gone round this Kaiser Joseph II once in the year
1776 holding some review there made his grenadier battalions and
artilleries form circle fronting the sky all round and give three
volleys of great arms and small Kaiser in the centre doffing hat at
each volley in honor of the hero Which was thought a very pretty thing
on the Kaisers part In 1824 the tree I suppose being gone to a
stump certain subscribing Prussian Officers had it rooted out and a
modest Pyramid of redveined marble built in its room Which latter
the then King of Prussia Friedrich Wilhelm III determined to improve
upon and so in 1839 built a second Pyramid close by bigger finer
and of Prussian iron this onepurchasing also from the Austrian
Government a rood or two of ground for site and appointing some
perpetual Peculium or increase of Pension to an Austrian Veteran of
merit for taking charge there All which perfectly in order is in
its place at this day The actual Austrian Pensioner of merit is a
loudvoiced hardfaced very limited but honest little fellow who
has worked a little polygon ditch and miniature hedge round the two
Monuments keeps his own cottage little garden and self respectably
clean and leads stoically a lone lifeno company I should think but
the Sterbohol hinds who probably are Czechs and cannot speak to him He
was once of the regiment Hohenlohe suffers somewhat from cold in
the wintertime in those upland parts the cords of wood allowed him
being limited but complains of nothing else Two English names were
in his Album a military two and no more EHRET DEN HELD Honor the
Hero we said to him at parting Dont I answered he glancing at
his muddy bare legs and little spade with which he had been working
in the Polygon Ditch when we arrived I could wish him an additional
KLAFTER HOLZ cord more of firewood now and then in the cold
months

Sterbohol Farmstead has been new built in mans memory but is dirty
as ever Agriculture all over this tableland of the Ziscaberg
I should judge to be bad Not so the prospect which is cheerfully
extensive picturesque in parts and to the student of Friedrich offers
good commentary Roads mansions villages Prossik Kyge Podschernitz
from the Heights of Chaber round to Nussel and beyond from any
knoll all Friedrichs Villages and many more lie round you as on a
maptheir dirt all hidden nothing wanting to the landscape were it
better carpeted with green green instead of russet and shaded here
and there with wood A small wild pink brightred and of the size of
a star grows extensively about of which you are tempted to pluck
specimens as memorial of a Field so famous in War Tourists Note

Chapter IIIPRAG CANNOT BE GOT AT ONCE

What Friedrichs emotions after the Battle of Prag were we do not much
know They are not inconceivable if we read his situation well but
in the way of speech there is as usual next to nothing Here are two
stray utterances worth gathering from a man so uncommunicative in that
form

FRIEDRICH A MONTH BEFORE PRAG From Lockwitz 25th March to Princess
Amelia at BerlinMy dearest Sister I give you a thousand thanks
for the hints you have got me from Dr Eller on the illness of our dear
Mother Thricewelcome this and reassures me alas not on good basis
against a misfortune which I should have considered very great for me

As to us and our posture of affairs political and militaryplace
yourself I conjure you above every event Think of our Country and
remember that ones first duty is to defend it If you learn that a
misfortune happens to one of us ask Did he die fighting and if Yes
give thanks to God Victory or else death there is nothing else for
us one or the other we must have All the world here is of that temper
What you would everybody sacrifice his life for the State and you
would not have your Brothers give the example Ah my dear Sister at
this crisis there is no room for bargaining Either at the summit of
glorious success or else abolished altogether This Campaign now
coming is like that of Pharsalia for Rome or that of Leuctra for the
Greeksa Campaign we verily shall have to win or go to wreck upon
_OEuvres de Frederic_ xxvii i 391

FRIEDERICH SHORTLY AFTER PRAG To his Mother Letter still extant in
Autograph without dateMy Brothers and I are still well The whole
Campaign runs risk of being lost to the Austrians and I find myself
free with 150000 men Add to this that we are masters of a Kingdom
Bohemia here which is obliged to furnish us with troops and money
The Austrians are dispersed like straw before the wind I will send a
part of my troops to compliment Messieurs the French and am going if I
once had Prag to pursue the Austrians with the rest of my Army Ib
xxvi 75

Friedrich who keeps his emotions generally to himself does not as
will be seen remain quite silent to us throughout this great Year
but by accident has left us some rather impressive gleanings in that
kindand certainly in no year could such accident have been luckier to
us this of 1757 being in several respects the greatest of his Life
From nearly the topmost heights down to the lowest deeps his fortunes
oscillated this year and probably of all the sons of Adam nobodys
outlooks and reflections had in them successive and simultaneous more
gigantic forms of fear and of hope He is on a very high peak at this
moment suddenly emerging from his thick cloud into thunderous victory
of that kind and warning all Pythons what they get by meddling with
the Sungod Loud enough farclanging is the sound of the silver bow
gazetteers and men all on pause at such new Phoebus Apollo risen in his
wraththe Victory at Prag considered to be much more annihilative
than it really was At London Lord Holderness had his Towerguns in
readiness waiting for something of the kind and the joy of the
people was frantic _Mitchell Papers and Memoirs_ i e the PRINTED
Selection 2 vols London 1850which will be the oftenest cited by
us Papers AND MEMOIRS i 249 Holderness to Mitchell 20th May
1757 Mitchell is now attending Friedrich his Letter from Keiths
Camp during the thunder of Friday May 6th is given ib i 248

Very dominant our Protestant Champion yonder on his Ziscaberg
bidding the enormous PompadourTheresa combinations the French
Austrian Swedish Russian populations and dread sovereigns check their
proud waves and hold at midflood It is thought had he in effect
annihilated the Austrian force at Prag that day Friday 6th May as
he might have done by waiting till Saturday 7th he could then with
the due rapidity rapidity being indispensable in the affair have
become master of Prag which meant of Bohemia altogether and have
stormed forward as his program bore into the heart of an Austria
still terrorstricken unralliedin which case it is calculated the
French the Russians Swedes much more the Reich and such like would
all have drawn bridle and Austria itself have condescended to make
Peace with a Neighbor of such quality and consent to his really modest
desire of being let alone Possible all thisthink Retzow and
others See RETZOW i 100108 c  But the King had not waited till
tomorrow no persuasion could make him wait and it is idle speculating
on the small turns which here as everywhere can produce such
deflections of course

Beyond question Prag is not captured and may as now garrisoned
require a great deal of capturingand perhaps it is but a PEAK this
high dominancy of Friedrichs not a solid tableland till much more
have been done Friedrich has nothing of the Gascon but there may well
be conceivable at this time a certain glow of internal pride like
that of Phoebus amid the piled tempestslike that of the One Man
prevailing if but for a short season against the Devil and All Men
I have made good my bit of resolution so far here are the Austrians
beaten at the set day and Prag summoned to surrender as per
program

Intrinsically Prag is not a strong City we have seen it taken in few
days in one nightand again as in Belleisles time we have seen it
making tough defence for a series of weeks It depends on the garrison
what extent of garrison the circuit of it being so immense and what
height of humor There are now 46000 men caged in it known to have
considerable magazines and Friedrich aware that it will cost trouble
bends all his strength upon it and from his two camps Ziscaberg
Weissenberg due Bridges uniting Keith and he batter it violently
aiming chiefly at the Magazines which are not all bombproof and hope
they may succeed before it is too late

The Vienna people are in the depths of amazement and discouragement
almost of terror had it not been for a few or especially for one high
heart among them Feldmarschall Daun on the news of May 6th hastily
fell back joined by the wrecks of the right wing which fled Sazawa
way BrunswickBevern with a 20000 is detached to look after Daun
finds Daun still on the retreat greedily collecting reinforcements
from the homeward quarter and hanging back though now double or so of
Beverns strength Amazement and discouragement are the general feeling
among Friedrichs enemies Notable to see how the whole hostile world
marching in upon himFrench Russians much more the Reich poor
faltering entitypauses as with its breath taken away at news of
Prag and arrested on the sudden with lifted foot ceases to stride
forward and merely tramptramps on the same place nay in part in the
Reich part visibly tramps backward for above a month ensuing
Who knows whether practically any of them will come on See
CORRESPONDANCE DU COMTE DE SAINTGERMAIN an Eyewitness i 108 cited
in Preuss ii 50 c c and not leave Austria by itself to do the
duel with Friedrich If Prag were but got and the 46000 well locked
away it would be very salutary for Friedrichs affairsWeek after
week the City holds out and there seems no hope of it except by
hunger and burning their Magazines by redhot balls




COLONEL MAYER WITH HIS FREECORPS PARTY MAKES A VISIT OF DIDACTIC
NATURE TO THE REICH

Friedrich as we saw on entering Bohmen had shot off a Light
Detachment under Colonel Mayer southward to seize any Austrian
Magazines there were especially one big Magazine at Pilsenwhich
Mayer has handsomely done May 2d Pilsen a bigger Magazine than
JungBunzlau even after which Mayer is now off westward into the
OberPfalz into the Nurnberg Countries to teach the Reich a small
lesson since they will not listen to Plotho Prag Battle as happens
had already much chilled the ardor of the Reich Mayer has two
FreeCorps his own and another about 1300 of foot to which are
added a 200 of hussars They have 5 cannon carry otherwise a minimum of
baggage are swift wild fellows sharp of stroke and do for the time
prove didactic to the Reich bringing home to its very bosom the late
great lesson of the Ziscaberg in an applied form Mayer made a pretty
course of it into the OberPfalz Countries scattering the poor
Execution DrillSergeants and incipiencies of preparation the
deliberative County Meetings KREISConvents ransoming Cities Nurnberg
for one city whose cries went to Friedrich on the Ziscaberg and wide
over the world In _HeldenGeschichte_ iv 360367 the Nurnberg
Letter and Response 31st May5th June 1757 in Pauli _Leben grosser
Helden_ iii 159 et seq Account of the Mayer Expedition also in
_MilitairLexikon _ iii 29 quoting from Pauli Nurnberg would have
been but too happy to refuse its contingent to the Reichs Army as
many others would have been poor KurBaiern hurrying off a kind
of Embassy to Friedrich great terror reigning among the wigs of
Regensburg and everybody drawing back that couldhad not Imperial
menaces and an Event that fell out by and by in Prag Country forced
compliance

Mayers Expedition made a loud noise in the Newspapers and was truly
of a shining nature in its kind very perfectly managed on Mayers part
and has traits in it which are amusing to read had one time Take one
small glance from Pauli

At Furth in Anspach 1st June after six days screwing of Nurnberg
from without which we had no cannon to take a Gratuity for the
Prussian troops amount not stated was demanded and given at
Schwabach farther up the Regnitz River they took quarters no
exemption made clergy and laity alike getting soldiers billeted Meat
and drink had to be given them as also 100 carolines guineas and
better and twenty new uniforms Upon which next day they marched
to Zirndorf and the Reichsgraf Pucklers Mansion the Schloss of
Farrenbach there Mayer took quarter in the Schloss itself Here the
noble owners got up a ball for Mayers entertainment and did all they
could contrive to induce a light treatment from him Figure it the
neighboring nobility and gentry in gala Mayer too in his best uniform
and smiling politely with those bright little black eyes of his For
he was a brilliant airy kind of fellow and had much of the chevalier
as well as of the partisan when requisite

Out of Farrenbach the Mayer people circulated upon all the neighboring
Lordships at Wilhelmsdorf the ReichsFurst von Hohenlohe a too busy
AntiPrussian had the worst brunt to bear The adjacent Baireuth lands
dear Wilhelmina fancy her too in such neighborhood were to the
utmost spared all billeting and even all transitthough wandering
sergeants of the Reichs Force one sergeant with the Wurzburg Herr
Commissarius and eight common men did get picked up on Baireuth ground
and this or the other Anspach Official Anspach being disaffected too
busy on the wrong side found himself suddenly Prisoner of War but was
given up at Wilhelminas gracious request On Bamberg he was sharp
as flint and had to be the Bambergers reinforced at last by
CircleMilitias KREISTRUPPEN in quantity being called out in mass
against him and at Vach an actual Passage of Fight had occurred

Of the Affair at Vach pretty little DrawnBattle mostly an affair
of art Mayer VERSUS Kreistroops to the amount of 6000 with twelve
cannon or some say twentyfour which they couldnt handle and how
Mayer cunningly took a position unassailable burnt Bridges of the
Regnitz River and plying his five cannon against these ardent awkward
people stood cheerful on the other side and then at last in good
time whisked himself off to the Hill of Culmbach with all his baggage
inexpugnable there for three daysof all this though it is set down
at full length we can say nothing Pauli iii 159 c who gives
Mayers own LETTER and others upon Vach And will add only that
having girt himself and made his packages Mayer left the Hill of
Culmbach and deliberately wended home by Coburg and other Countries
where he had business eating his way and early in July was safe in
the Metal Mountains again having fluttered the Volscians in their
Frankenland Corioli to an unexpected extent It is one of five or six
such sallies Friedrich made upon the Reich sometimes upon the Austrians
and Reich together to tumble up their magazines and preparations Rapid
unexpected inroads year after year done chiefly by the FreeCorps and
famous enough to the then Gazetteers Of which or of their doers as
we can in time coming afford little or no notice let us add this small
Note on the FreeCorps topic which is a large one in the Books but
must not interrupt us again

Before this War was done say my Authorities there came gradually
to be twentyone Prussian FreeCorpsfoot almost all there being
already Hussars in quantity ever since the first Silesian experiences
Notable Aggregates they were of loose wandering fellows broken Saxons
Prussians French HungarianProtestant some of them Deserters from
all the Armies not a few attracted by the fame of Friedrichas the

Poor Mayer died within two years hence 5th January 1759 of fever
caught by unheardof exertions and over fatigues after many exploits
and with the highest prospect opening on him A man of many adventures
of many qualities a wild dash of chivalry in him all along and much
military and other talent crossed in the growing In the dull old Books
I read one other fact which is vivid to me That Wilhelmina as sequel
of those first Franconian exploits and procedures had given him her
Order of Knighthood ORDER OF SINCERITY AND FIDELITYpoor dear
Princess what an interest to Wilhelmina this flash of her Brothers
thunder thrown into those Franconian parts and across her own pungent
anxieties and sorrowfully affectionate thoughts in these weeks

Shortly after Mayer about the time when Mayer was wending homeward
General von Oldenburg a very valiant punctual old General was pushed
out westward upon Erfurt a City of KurMainzs to give KurMainz a
similar monition And did it handsomely impressively upon the Gazetteer
world at least and the Erfurt populationsthough we can afford it no
room in this place Oldenburgs force was but some 2000 Pirna Saxons
most of themsuch a winter Oldenburg has had with these Saxons
bursting out into actual musketry upon him once Oldenburg
volcanically steady summoning the Prussian part To me true Prussian
Burscheand hanging nine of the mutinous Saxons And has coerced
and compesced them all that did not contrive to desert into soldierly
obedience and 20th June appears at the Gate of Erfurt with them
to do his delicate errand there Sharply conclusive though polite and
punctual Send to KurMainz say you Well as to your Citadel and
those 1400 soldiers all moving peaceably off thitherYes As to

If Prag Siege go well these MayerOldenburg expeditions will have an
effect on the Reich but if it go ill what are they against Austria
with its force of steady pressure All turns on the issue of Prag
Siegea fact extremely evident to Friedrich too But these are what
in the interim can be done One neglects no opportunity tries by every
method




OF THE SINGULAR QUASIBEWITCHED CONDITION OF ENGLAND AND WHAT IS TO BE
HOPED FROM IT FOR THE COMMON CAUSE IF PRAG GO AMISS

On the Britannic side too the outlooks are not goodmuch need
Friedrich were through his Prag affair and hastening with forty
thousand to help his Alliesthat is Royal Highness of Cumberland and
Britannic Purse his only allies at this moment Royal Highness and
Army of Observation should have been 67000 are 50 to 60000 hired
Germans troops good enough were they tolerably led finds the Hanover
Program as bad as Schmettau and Friedrich ever represented it and
alreadyunless Prag go wellwears to the understanding eye a
very contingent aspect DEstrees outnumbers him DEstrees too is
something of a soldiera very considerable advantage in affairs of
war

DEstrees since April is in Wesel gathering in the revenues
changing the Officialities much out of discipline they sayhanging
gradually 1000 marauders in round numbers 1000 this Year Stenzel
v 65 Retzow i 173 DEstrees does not yet push forward owing to
Prag If he doIt is well known how Royal Highness fared when he did
and what a Campaign Royal Highness made of it this Year 1757 How the
Weser did prove wadable as Schmettau had said to no purpose wadable
bridgable and Royal Highness had to wriggle back ever back no stand
to be made or far worse than none back ever back till he got into
the Sea for that matter and to the END of more than one thing Poor
man friends say he has an incurable Hanover Ministry a Program that is
inexecutable As yet he has not lost head any head he ever had but he
is wonderful heand his England is We shall have to look at him once
again and happily once only Here from my Constitutional Historian
are some Passages which we may as well read in the present interim of
expectation I label and try to arrange

1 ENGLAND IN CRISIS England is indignant with its Hero of Culloden
and his Campaign 1757 but really has no business to complain Royal
Highness of Cumberland wriggling helplessly in that manner is a fair
representative of the England that now is For years back there has
been in regard to all things Foreign or Domestic in that Country by
way of National action the miserablest haggling as to which of
various littlecompetent persons shall act for the Nation A melancholy
condition indeed

But the fact is his Grace of Newcastle ever since his poor Brother
Pelham died who was always a solid loyal kind of man though a dull
and had always with patient affection furnished his Grace much
UNsupplied otherwise with Common sense hitherto is quite insecure in
Parliament and knows not what hand to turn to Fox is contemptuous of
him Pitt entirely impatient of him Duke of Cumberland great in the
glory of Culloden is aiming to oust him and bear rule with his Young
Nephew the new Rising Sun as the poor Papa and Grandfather gets old
Even Carteret Earl Granville as they now call him a Carteret much
changed since those highsoaring WormsHanau times was applied to
But the answer waswhat could the answer be Highsoaring Carteret
scandalously overset and hurled out in that Hanau time had already
tried once long ago and with such result to spring in again and
deliver his Majesty from factions and actually had made a Granville
Ministry Ministry which fell again in one day 11th February 1746
Thackeray _Life of Chatham_ i 146 To the complete disgust of
CarteretGranvillewho ever since sits ponderously dormant kind of
Fixture in the Privy Council this long while back and is resigned
in a big contemptuous way to have had his really considerable career
closed upon him by the smallest of mankind and except occasional
blurts of strong rugged speech which come from him and a good deal of
wine taken into him disdains making farther debate with the world and
its elect Newcastles Carteret at this crisis was again applied to
Cannot you In behalf of an afflicted old King But Carteret answered
No Ib i 464

In short it is admitted and bewailed by everybody seldom was there
seen such a Government of England and England has seen some strange
Governments as in these last Three Years Chaotic Imbecility reigning
pretty supreme Rulers Workpolicy administration governance
guidance performance in any kindwhere is it to be found For if
even a Walpole when his TalkingApparatus gets out of gear upon him is
reduced to extremities though the stoutest of menfancy what it will
be in like case and how the ActingApparatuses and Affairs generally
will go with a poor hysterical Newcastle now when his Common Sense is
fatally withdrawn The poor man has no resource but to shuffle about in
aimless perpetual fidget endeavoring vainly to say Yes and No to all
questions Foreign and Domestic that may rise Whereby in the
Affairs of England there has as it were universal StVituss dance
supervened at an important crisis and the Preparations for America
and for a downright LifeandDeath Wrestle with France on the
JENKINSSEAR QUESTION are quite in a bad way In an ominously bad Why
cannot we draw a veil over these things

2 PITT AND THE HOUR OF TIDE The fidgetings and shufflings the
subtleties inane trickeries and futile hitherings and thitherings of
Newcastle may be imagined a man not incapable of trick but anxious
to be well with everybody and to answer Yes and No to almost
everythingand not a little puzzled poor soul to get through in
that impossible way Such a paralysis of wriggling imbecility fallen
over England in this great crisis of its fortunes as is still painful
to contemplate and indeed it has been mostly shaken out of mind by
the modern Englishman who tries to laugh at it instead of weeping
and considering which would better beseem Pitt speaks with a tragical
vivacity in all ingenious dialects lively though serious and with
a depth of sad conviction which is apt to be slurred over and missed
altogether by a modern reader Speaks as if this brave English Nation
were about ended little or no hope left for it here a gleam of
possibility and there a gleam which soon vanishes again in the fatal
murk of impotencies donothingisms Very sad to the heart of Pitt A
once brave Nation arrived at its critical point and doomed to higgle
and puddle there till it drown in the gutters considerably tragical
to Pitt who is lively ingenious and though not quitting the
Parliamentary tone for the HebrewProphetic far more serious than the
modern reader thinks

In Walpoles Book _Memoirs of the Last Ten Years of George II_ there
is the liveliest Picture of this dismal Parliamentary Hellbrothsuch
a Mother of Dead Dogs as one has seldom looked into For the Hour is
great and the Honorable Gentlemen I must say are small The hour
little as you dream of it my Honorable Friends is pregnant with
questions that are immense Wide Continents long Epochs and AEons hang
on this poor jargoning of yours the Eternal Destinies are asking
their muchfavored Nation Will you can youmuchfavored Nation is
answering in that manner Astonished at its own stupidity and taking
refuge in laughter The Eternal Destinies are very patient with some
Nations and can disregard their follies for a long while and have
their Cromwell have their Pitt or what else is essential ready for
the poor Nation in a grandly silent way

Certain it isthough how could poor Newcastle know it at allhere
is again the hour of tide for England Tide is full again has been
flowing long hundreds of years and is full certain too that time and
tide wait on no man or nation In a dialect different from Cromwells or
Pitts but with a sense true to theirs I call it the Eternal Destinies
knocking at Englands door again Are you ready for the crisis
birthpoint of long Ages to you which is now come Greater question
had not been for centuries past None to be named with it since that
high Spiritual Question truly a much higher and which was in fact
the PARENT of this and of all of high and great that lay ahead which
England and Oliver Cromwell were there to answer Will you hold by
Consecrated Formulas then you English and expect salvation from
traditions of the elders or are you for Divine Realities as the one
sacred and indispensable thing Which they did answer in what way we
know Truly the Highest Question which if a Nation can answer WELL it
will grow in this world and may come to be considerable and to have
many high Questions to answerthis of Pitts for example And the
Answers given do always extend through coming ages and do always bear
harvests accursed or else blessed according as the Answers were A
thing awfully true if you have eye for ita thing to make Honorable
Gentlemen serious even in the age of percussioncaps No my friend
Newcastleisms impious Poltrooneries in a Nation do not dieneither
thank God do Cromwellisms and pious Heroisms but are alive for the
poor Nation even in its somnambulancies in its stupidest dreams For
Nations have their somnambulancies and at any rate the questions
put to Nations in different ages vary much Not in any age or
turningpoint in History had England answered the Destinies in such a
dialect as now under its Newcastle and National Palaver

3 OF WALPOLE AS RECORDING ANGEL Walpoles _George the Second_ is a
Book of far more worth than is commonly ascribed to it almost the
one original English Book yet written on those timeswhich by the
accident of Pitt are still memorable to us But for Walpoleburning
like a small steady light there shining faithfully if stingily on the
evil and the goodthat sordid muddle of the Pelham Parliaments which
chanced to be the element of things now recognizable enough as great
would be forever unintelligible He is unusually accurate punctual
lucid an irrefragable authority on English points And if in regard to
Foreign he cannot be called an understanding witness he has read
the best Documents accessible has conversed with select Ambassadors
Mitchell and the like as we can guess and has informed himself to
a degree far beyond most of his contemporaries In regard to Pitts
Speeches in particular his brief jottings done rapidly while the
matter was still shining to him are the only Reports that have the
least human resemblance We may thank Walpole that Pitt is not dumb to
us as well as dark Very curious little scratchings and etchings those
of Walpole frugal swift but punctual and exact hasty penandink
outlines at first view all barren bald as an invoice seemingly but
which yield you after long study there and elsewhere a conceivable
notion of what and how excellent these Pitt Speeches may have been
Airy winged like arrowflights of Phoebus Apollo very superlative
Speeches indeed Walpoles Book is carefully printedfew errors in
it like that Chapeau for CHASOT which readers rememberbut in
respect to editing may be characterized as still wanting an Editor A
Book UNedited little but lazy ignorance of a very hopeless type
thick contented darkness traceable throughout in the marginal part No
attempt at an Index or at any of the natural helps to a reader now at
such distance from it Nay till you have at least marked on the top of
each page what Month and Year it actually is the Book cannot be read
at allexcept by an idle creature doing worse than nothing under the
name of reading

4 PITTS SPEECHES FORESHADOWING WHAT It is a kind of epoch in your
studies of modern English History when you get to understand of Pitts
Speeches that they are not Parliamentary Eloquences but things which
with his whole soul he means and is intent to DO This surprising
circumstance when at last become undeniable makes on the sudden an
immense difference for the Speeches and you Speeches are not a thing
of high moment to this Editor it is the Thing spoken and how far the
speaker means to do it that this Editor inquires for Too many Speeches
there are which he hears admired all round and has privately to
entertain a very horrid notion of Speeches the finest in quality
were quality really fine conceivable in such case which WANT a
corresponding fineness of source and intention corresponding nobleness
of purport conviction tendency these if we will reflect are
frightful instead of beautiful Yesand always the frightfuler the
finer they are and the faster and farther they go sowing themselves
in the dim vacancy of mens minds For Speeches like all human things
though the fact is now little remembered do always rank themselves as
forever blessed or as forever unblessed Sheep or goats on the right
hand of the Final Judge or else on the left There are Speeches which
can be called true and again Speeches which are not trueHeavens
only think what these latter are Sacked wind which you are intended
to SOWthat you may reap the whirlwind After long reading I find
Chathams Speeches to be what he pretends they are true and worth
speaking then and there Noble indeed I can call them with you the
highly noble Foreshadow necessary preface and accompaniment of Actions
which are still nobler A very singular phenomenon within those walls
or without

Pitt though nobly eloquent is a Man of Action not of Speech an
authentically Royal kind of Man And if there were a Plutarch in these
times with a good deal of leisure on his hands he might run a Parallel
between Friedrich and Chatham Two radiant Kings very shining Men of
Action both both of them hard bested as the case often is For your
born King will generally have if not all Europe against him at
least pretty much all the Universe Chathams course to Kingship was
not straight or smoothas Friedrich too had his wellnigh fatal
difficulties on the road Again says the Plutarch they are very
brave men both and of a clearness and veracity peculiar among their
contemporaries In Chatham too there is something of the flash of
steel a very sharpcutting penetrative rapid individual he too and
shaped for action first of all though he has to talk so much in the
world Fastidious proud no King could be prouder though his element
is that of FreeSenate and Democracy And he has a beautiful poetic
delicacy withal great tenderness in him playfulness grace in
all ways an airy as well as a solid loftiness of mind Not born a
Kingalas no not officially so only naturally so has his kingdom
to seek The Conquering of Silesia the Conquering of the Pelham
ParliamentsBut we will shut up the Plutarch with time on his hands

Pitts Speeches as I spell them from Walpole and the other faint
tracings left are full of genius in the vocal kind far beyond any
Speeches delivered in Parliament serious always and the very truth
such as he has it but going in many dialects and modes full of airy
flashings twinkles and coruscations Sport as of sheetlightning
glancing about the bolt lying under the horizon bolt HIDDEN as is
fit under such a horizon as he had A singularly radiant man Could
have been a Poet too in some small measure had he gone on that line
There are many touches of genius comic tragic lyric something of
humor even to be read in those Shadows of Speeches taken down for us by
Walpole

In one word Pitt shining like a gleam of sharp steel in that murk of
contemptibilities is carefully steering his way towards Kingship over
it Tragical it is especially in Pitts case first and last to see a
Royal Man or Born King wading towards his throne in such an element
But alas the Born King even when he tries which I take to be the
rarer case so seldom can arrive there at allsinful Epochs there are
when Heavens curse has been spoken and it is that awful Being the
Born ShamKing that arrives Pitt however does it Yes and the more
we study Pitt the more we shall find he does it in a peculiarly high
manful and honorable as well as dexterous manner and that English
History has a right to call him the acme and highest man of
Constitutional Parliaments the like of whom was not in any Parliament
called Constitutional nor will again be

Well probably enough too probably But what it more concerns us to
remember here is the fact That in these dismal shufflings which have
been Pittin spite of Royal dislikes and Newcastle peddlings and
chicanerieshas been actually in Office in the due topmost place the
poor English Nation ardently demanding him in what ways it could
Been in Officeand is actually out again in spite of the Nation Was
without real power in the Royal Councils though of noble promise and
planting himself down herolike evidently bent on work and on ending
that unutterable StVitussdance that had gone so high all round
him Without real power we say and has had no permanency Came in
11th19th November 1756 thrown out 5th April 1757 After six months
trial the St Vitus finds that it cannot do with him and will prefer
going on again The last act his Royal Highness of Cumberland did in
England was to displace Pitt Down you I am the man said Royal
Highness and went to the Weser Countries on those terms

Would the reader wish to see in summary what Pitts Offices have been
since he entered on this career about thirty years ago Here from
our Historian is the List of them in order of time STAGES OF PITTS
COURSE he calls it

perhaps Pitt admired for his madrigals for his Literary patronizings
and favor to the WestWickham set Speech full of airy lightning was
much admired Followed by many with the lightning getting denser
and denser always on the Opposition side once on the JENKINSSEAR
QUESTION as we saw when the Gazetteer Editor spelt him Mr Pitts so
that Majesty was very angry sulky Public much applausive and Walpole
was heard to say We must muzzle in some way that terrible Cornet

being awfully high AUGUSTOCTOBER 1744 Sarah Duchess of Marlborough

or Horseguards element I fancy and was as the nailing of his
Parliamentary colors to the mast

Germany the second day after Pitt had been IN rather more than Four
months England at that time a silent Country in comparison knew not
well what to do took to offering him Freedoms of Corporations in
very great quantity Town after Town from all the four winds

In these sad circumstances Preparations so called have been making for
Hanover for Americasuch preparations as were never seen before Take
only one instance let one be enough

By the London Gazette well on in February 1756 we learn that Lord
Loudon a military gentleman of small faculty but of good connections
has been nominated to command the Forces in America and then more
obscurely some days after that another has been nominatedone of
them ought certainly to make haste out if he could the French by
account have 25000 men in those countries with real officers to lead
them Haste out however is not what this Lord Loudon or his rival can
make In March we learn that Lord Loudon has been again nominated
in an improved manner this timeand still does not look like going
Again nominated why again Alas reader there have been hysterical
fidgetings in a high quarter internal shiftings and shufflings
contradictions new proposals one knows not what _Gentlemans
Magazine _ for 1756 pp 92 150 359 450 One asks only How is the
business ever to be done if you cannot even settle what imbecile is to
go and try it

Seldom had Country more need of a Commander than America now America
itself is of willing mind and surely has resources in such a Cause
but is full of anarchies as well the different States and sections of
it with their discrepant Legislatures their halfdrilled Militias
pulling each a different way there is as in the poor Mother Country
little result except of the StVitus kind In some Legislatures
are anarchic Quakers who think it unpermissible to fight with those
hectoring French and their tail of scalping Indians and that the
method of love ought to be tried with them What is to become of those
poor people if not even a Lord Loudon can get out

The result was Lord Loudon had not in his own poor person come to hand
in America till August 1756 Season now done and could only write
home All is St Vitus out here Must have reinforcement of 10000
men Yes answers Pitt who is now in Office you shall have them
and we will take Cape Breton please Heavenbut was thrown out and
by the wrigglings that ensued nothing of the 10000 reached Lord Loudon
till Season 1757 too was done Nor did they then stead his Lordship
much then or afterwards who never took Cape Breton nor was like doing
itbut wriggled to and fro a good deal and revolved on his axis
according to pattern given And set what chiefly induces us to name
him here his not reverent enough Subordinate Lord Charles Hay our old
Fontenoy friend into angry impatient quizzing of himand by and
by into CourtMartial for such quizzing Peerage Books Tweeddale
CourtMartial which was much puzzled by the case and could decide
nothing but only adjourn and adjournas we will now do not
mentioning Lord Loudon farther or the numerous other instances at all
1st May 1760 MajorGeneral Lord Charles Hay died _Gentlemans
Magazine_ of Year and his particular CourtMartial could adjourn for
the last timeI wrote something for Lord Charles said the great
Johnson once many years afterwards and I thought he had nothing to
fear from a CourtMartial I suffered a great loss when he died he was
a mighty pleasing man in conversation and a reading man Boswells
_Life of Johnson_ under date 3d April 1776

Pitt we just saw far from being confirmed and furthered has been
thrown out by Royal Highness of Cumberland the last thing before
crossing to that exquisite Weser Problem Nothing now left at home to
hinder us and our Hanover and Weser Problem thinks Royal Highness
No indeed a comfortable pacific Nogovernment or Battle of the Four
Elements left yonder the Anarch Old waggling his addle head over it
ready to help everybody and bring fire and water and Yes and No into
holy matrimony if he couldLet us return to Prag Only one remark
more upon April 5th That was the Day of Pitts Dismissal at
St Jamess and I find at Schonbrunn it is likewise the day when
REICHSHOFRATH Kaiser in Privy Council decides in respect to
Friedrich that Ban of the Reich must be proceeded with and recommends
Reichs Diet to get through with the same _HeldenGeschichte_
ReichsProcedures UBI SUPRA Official England ordering its Pitt into
private life and Official Teutschland its Friedrich into outlawry Be
quiet henceforth both of YOUare by chance synchronous phenomena




PHENOMENA OF PRAG SIEGEPRAG SIEGE IS INTERRUPTED

Friedrichs Siege of Prag proved tedious beyond expectation In
four days he had done that exploit in 1744 but now to the worlds
disappointment in as many weeks he cannot Nothing was omitted on his
part he seized all egresses from Prag rapidly enough had beset them
with batteries on the very night or morrow of the Battle every egress
beset cannon and ruin forbidding any issue there On the 9th of May
cannonading began proper siegecannon and ammunition coming up
from Dresden were completely come May 19th after which the place is
industriously battered bombarded with redhot balls but except by
hunger it will not do Prag as a fortress is weak but as a breastwork
for 50000 men it is strong The Austrians tried sallies but these
availed nothingvery illconducted say some The Prussians more than
once had nearly got into the place by surprisal but owing to mere
luck of the Austrians never couldsay the same parties Archenholtz

intention to inflict on readers in this haste Siege lasted six weeks

Prag on condition of Free withdrawal No you shall engage such of
you as wont enlist with us not to serve against me for six years
Here are some select Specimens Prussian chiefly in an abridged
state

MAY 19th No sooner was our artillery come all the grounds and beds
for it had been ready beforehand than as evening fell it began to
play in terrific fashion

NIGHT OF THE 23d24th MAY There broke out a furious sally their
first and much their hottest say the Prussians a very serious
affairwhich fell upon Keiths quarter west side of the Moldau
Sally say something like 10000 strong picked men all and
strengthened with half a pound of horseflesh each unluckily without
salt judge what the common diet must have been when that was
generous No salt to it but a fair supplement of brandy Browne from
his bed of pain died 26th June had been strongly urgent Aim is To
force the Prussian lines by determination and the help of darkness
in some weak point the whole Army standing ranked on the walls shall
follow if things go well and storm itself throughaway Daunwards
across the River by Podoli Bridge

Sally broke out between 1 and 2 AM but we had wind of it and were
on the alert Sally tried on this place and on that very furious in
places but could not anywhere prevail The tussling lasted for near
six hours Prince Ferdinand of Preussen Kings youngest Brother and
others of us getting hurts and doing exploitstill about 7 AM
it was wholly swept in with loss of 1000 dead Upon which their
whole Army retired to its quarters in a hopeless condition Escape
impossible Near 50000 of them but in such a posture Provision of
bread the spies say is not scarce unless the Prussians can burn
it which they are industriously trying diligent to learn where the
Magazines are and to fire incessantly upon the same plenty of meal
hitherto but for butchersmeat only what we saw Forage nearly done
and 12000 horses standing in the squares and marketplacesnot even
stabling for them not to speak of food or workslaughtering and
salting if one but had salt the one method Horseflesh two kreutzers
a pound rises gradually to double that value

MAY 29th About sunset there came a furious burst of weather
raintorrents mixed with battering hailsome flaw of waterspout among
the Hills for it lasted hour on hour and Moldau came down roaring
doubledeep above a hundred yards too wide each way with cargoes of
ruin tornup trees drowned horses which sorely tried our Bridge at
Branik Bridge half of it did break away Friedrichs half fortyfour
pontoons Keiths people got their end of the Bridge doubled in and
saved the Austrians in Prag fished out twentyfour of Friedrichs
pontoons the other twenty we caught at our Bridge of Podoli farther
down A most wild night for the Prussian Army in tents and indeed for
Prag itself the low parts of which were all under water unfortunate
individuals getting drowned in the cellars and still more important a
great deal of Austrian meal which had been carried thither to be safe
from the redhot balls

It was thought the Austrians our Bridge being down might try a sally
again To prevent which hardly was the rain done when on our part a
rocket flew aloft and there began on the City from all sides a deluge
of bombs and red hot balls So that the stilldripping City was set
fire to in various parts and we could hear what this Editor never can

Friedrich has been doing his utmost diligent by all methods to learn
where the Austrian Magazines were that is on what special edifices
and localities shot might be expended with advantage and has fired into
these about 12000 bombs Here is a small thing still remembered

Spies being above all essential in this business Friedrich had
bethought him of one Kasebier a supreme of Housebreakers whom he
has safe with a ball at his ankle doing forced labor at Spandau
in Stettin if it mattered Kasebier was actually sent for pardon
promised him if he could do the State a service Kasebier smuggled
himself twice perhaps three times into Prag but the fourth time he
did not come back Retzow i 108 n Another Note says Kasebier
was a Tailor and Son of a Tailor in Halle and the expertest of
Thieves Had been doing forced labor in Stettin since 1748 twice did
get into Prag third time vanished A highly celebrated Prussian thief
still a myth among the People like Dick Turpin or Cartouche except
that his was always theft without violence Preuss ii 57 n

We learn vaguely that the price of horseflesh in Prag has risen to
double famine very sore but still one hears nothing of surrender And
again there is vague rumor that the City may be as it will but that
the Garrison has meal after all we have ruined which will last till
October Such a Problem has this King soluble within the time or not
soluble Such a question for the whole world and for himself more than
any

Chapter IVBATTLE OF KOLIN

On and after June 9th the bombardment at Prag abated and never rose
to briskness again the place of trial for decision of that Siege having
flitted elsewhither as we said About that time rumors came in not
so favorable from the Duke of Bevern which Friedrich strong in hope
strove visibly to disbelieve but at last could not Bevern reports that
Daun is actually coming on far too strong for his resistingin other
terms that the Siege of Prag will not decide itself by bombardment but
otherwise and elsewhere Of which we must now give some account brief
as may be especially in regard to the preliminary or marching part

Daun whose light troops plundered Brandeis almost within wind of the
Prussian Rear on the day while Prag Battle was fighting had on that
fatal event gradually drawn back to Czaslau a place we used to know
fifteen years ago and there or in those neighborhoods defensively
manoeuvring and hanging upon Kuttenberg Kolin especially upon
his Magazine of Suchdol Daun always rather drawing back with
BrunswickBevern vigilantly waiting on him has continued ever since
diligently recruiting himself ranking the remains of the right wing
defeated at Prag drawing regiments out of Mahren or whencesoever to
be had Till by these methods he is grown 60000 strong nearly thrice
superior to Bevern though being a Fabius Cunctator so called by and
by he as yet attempts nothing Forty thousand in Prag with Sixty here
in the Czaslau Quarter Tempelhof i 196 Retzow i 107 109
counts 4600066000 that makes 100000 say his Prussian Majesty
has twothirds of the number can the Fabius Cunctator attempt nothing
before Prag utterly famish

Order comes to him from Vienna Rescue Prag straightway go upon it
cost what it like Daun does go upon it advances visibly towards Prag
Bevern obliged to fall back in front of him Sunday 12th June Daun
despatches several Officers to Prince Karl at Prag with notice that
On the 20th Monday come a week he will be in the neighborhood of Prag
with this viewthey of course to sally out and help from rearward
Several Officers under various disguises go with that message June
12th but none of them could get into the City and some of them I
judge must have fallen into the Prussian Hussar Partiesat any rate
the news they carried did get into the Prussian circuit and produced
an instant resolution there Early next morning Monday 13th King
Friedrich with what disposable force is on the spot10000 capable
of being spared from siegework and 4000 more that will be capable of
following under Prince Moritz in two dayssets forth in all speed
Joins Bevern that same night at Kaurzim thirtyfive miles off which
is about midway from Prag to Czaslau and only three miles or so from
Dauns quarters that nighthad the King known it which he did not

Daun must be instantly gone into and shallif he is there at all and
not fallen back at the first rumor of us as Friedrich rather supposes
In any case there are preliminaries indispensable the 4000 of Prince
Moritz still to come up secondly bread to be had for us which is
baking at Nimburg across the Elbe twenty miles off lastly or rather
firstly and most indispensable of all Daun to be reconnoitred
Friedrich reconnoitres Daun with all diligence pushes on everything
according to his wont much obstructed in the reconnoitring by Pandour
clouds under which Daun has veiled himself which far outnumber our
small Hussar force Daun as usualshowing always great skill in
regard to camps and positionshas planted himself in difficult
country a little river with its boggy pools in front behind and
around an intricate broken country of knolls and swamps one ridge in
it which they even call a BERG or Hill Kamhayek Berg not much of a
Hill after all but forming a long backbone to the locality west end
of it straight behind Dauns centre at present Friedrichs position is
from north to south like Dauns taking advantage of what heights and
brooks there are and edging northward to be near his breadovens right
wing still holds by Kaurzim left wing looking down on Planian a little
Town on the High Road KAISERSTRASSE from Prag to Vienna Little Town
destined to get up its name in a day or twonext little Town to which
twelve miles farther on is Kolin secretly destined to become and
continue still more famous among mankind Kolin is close to the Elbe
left or south bank Elbe hereabouts strikes into his long northwestern
course to Wittenberg all the way Pirna say 150 miles off is his
halfway house in that directionstrikes off northward hereabouts
making for Nimburg among other places Planian right south of Nimburg
is already fifteen good miles from Elbe

This is Friedrichs position Wednesday June 15th and the day
following somewhat nearer his ovens than yesterday Daun is yet
parallel to him has his centre behind Swoyschitz an insignificant
Village at the foot of those Kamhayek Heights which is ever since
to be found in Maps Friday 17th Friedrichs breadwagons and 4000
having come in as doubtless the Pandours report in the proper place
Daun does not quite like his strong position any more but would prefer
a stronger Friday about sunset great clouds of dust rise from Daun
changing his position the Prussians see if for Pandours and gathering
darkness they can at present see little else Daun truly observing the
King to have in that manner edged up towards Planian is afraid of his
right wing from such a neighbor So that the reader must take his Map
again Or if he care not for such things let him skip and leave me
solitary to my sad function till we can meet on easier ground and
report the battle which ensued Daun hustles his right wing back out of
that dangerous proximity wheels his whole right wing and centre ninety
degrees round so as to reach out now towards Kolin and lie on the
north slope of the Kamhayek ridge places his left wing EN POTENCE
gibbetwise hanging round the western end of said Kamhayek its
southern extremity at Swoyschitz its northern at Hradenin where not
a mile from Planian his right wing had formerly beenwith other
intricate movements not worth following under my questionable guidance
on a Map with unpronounceable names Enough to say that Dauns right
wing is now far east at Krzeczhorz well beyond Chotzemitz whereabouts
his centre now comes to stand and most of his horse THERE both the
wings being hilly and rough unfit for horseand that this being
nearly the last of Dauns shiftings and hustlings for the present or
indeed in essential respects the very last readers may as well note the
above main points in it

Hustled into this still stronger place with wheeling and shoving which
lasted to a late hour Daun composes himself for the night He lies now
with centre and right looking northward pretty much parallel to the
PlanianKolin or PragVienna Highway and about a mile south of the
same extreme posts extending almost to Kolin on that side left wing
well planted EN POTENCE Kamhayek ridge north face and west end of it
completely his on both the exposed or AntiPrussian faces Friedrich
feels uncertain whether he has not gone his ways altogether but
proposes to ascertain by break of day

By break of day Friedrich starts having cleared off certain Pandour
swarms visible in places of difficulty who go on first notice and
without shot fired Lloyd i 61 et seq or Tempelhofs Translation

a certain Inn on the wayside WIRTHSHAUS of Slatislunz or GOLDENSUN
say the Modern Booksthough I am driven to think it Novomiesto nearer
Planian but will not quarrel on the subject Inn of good height for
one thing and there mounting to the topstory or perhaps the leads
descries Daun stretching far and wide leant against the Kamhayek
in the summer morning What a sight for Friedrich Big game SHALL be
played then death sure this day to thousands of men and to me
Well

Friedrich calls halt rest here a little to consider examine settle
how A hot close morning rest for an hour or two till our rear from
Kaurzim come up horses and men will be the better for ithorses can
have a mouthful of grass mouthful of water some of them had no drink

get into a blaze of battlerage this day and be blown to pieces a great

At this Hostelry of Novomiesto not of Slatislunz or GOLDENSUN at
all which is a Sun fallen dismally eclipsed in other ways The Inn
of SlatiSlunz was burnt about twenty years ago nothing of it but
the stone walls now dates from Friedrichs time It is a biggish
solidlooking House of two stories whether ever of three I could not

to any view of Daun even from a third story TOURISTS NOTE
1858Tempelhof UBI SUPRA seems to have known the right place not
Retzow or almost anybody since and indeed the question except for
expressly Military people is of no moment Friedrich halted for
three hours and more saw Daun developing himself into new Order of
Battle every part of his position visible considered with his whole
might what was to be tried upon himand about noon having made up his
mind called his Generals in sight of the phenomenon itself there to
give them their various orders and injunctions in regard to the same
The Plan of Fight which was thought then and is still thought by
everybody an excellent oneresting on the oblique order of attack
Friedrichs favorite modewas if the reader will take his Map
conceivable as follows

Daun has by this time deployed himself in three lines or two lines and
a reserve on the highlying Champaign south of the PlanianKolin Great
Road south say a mile and over the crests of the rising ground or
Kamhayek ridge so that from the Great Road you can see nothing of him
His line swaying here and there a little to take advantage of its
ground extends nearly five miles from east to west pointing towards
Planian side the left wing of it from Planian eastward the way
Friedrich has marched Dauns left wing may be four miles distant On
the other side Dauns right wingmain line always pretty parallel
to the Highway and pointing rather southward of Kolinreaches to the
small Hamlet of Krzeczhorz which is two miles off Kolin In front of
his centre is a Village called Chotzemitz from which for a while
in those months the Battle gets its name Battle of Chotzemitz by
Dauns christening in front of him to right or to left of Chotzemitz
are some four or even six other Villages dim rustic Hamlets invisible
from the High Road every Village of which Daun has well beset with
batteries with good infantry not to speak of Croat parties hovering
about or dismounted Pandours squatted in the corn That easternmost
Village of his is spelt Krzeczhorz unpronounceable to mankind
a dirty little place in and round which the Battle had its hinge or
cardinal point the others as abstruse of spelling all but equally
impossible to the human organs we will forbear to name except in case
of necessity Half a mile behind Krzeczhorz let us write it Kreczor
for the future what can we do is a thin little Oakwood bushes
mainly but with sparse trees too which is now quite stubbed out
though it was then important enough and played a great part in the
result of this days work Radowesnitz a pronounceable little Village
half a mile farther or southward of the Oakbush is beyond the
extremity of Dauns position low down on a marshy little Brook
which oozes through lakes and swamps towards Kolin in the northerly
direction

Most or all of these Villages are on little Brooks natural thirst so
leading them always some little runlet of water not so swampy when
there is any fall for it in general lively when it gets over the ridge
and becomes visible from this Highway And it is curious to see what
a considerable dell or green ascending chasm this little thread of
water working at all moments for thousands of years has hollowed out
for itself in the sloping ground making a great military obstacle if
you are mounting to attack there Poor Czech Hamlets all of them dirty
dark malodorous ignorant abhorrent of German speechin what nook
those inarticulate inhabitants diving underground at a great rate this
morning have hidden themselves today I know not The country consists
of knolls and slopes with swamps intermediate rises higher on the
Planian side but except the top of that Kamhayek ridge on the Planian
side and FriedrichsBerg on the Kolin side there is nothing
that you could think of calling a Hill though many Books and even
Friedrichs Book rashly say otherwise FriedrichsBerg now so called
is on the north side of the Highway half a mile northeastward of
Slatislunz the malodorous Inn A conical height of perhaps a hundred
and fifty feet rises rather suddenly from the stillsloping ground
checking the slope there on which the Austrian populations have built
some memorial lately notable to Tourists Here Friedrich stood during
the Battle say they and the Prussians had a battery there Which
remains uncertain to me at least the battery part of it that Friedrich
himself was there now and then can be believed but not that he kept
standing there for long together FriedrichsBerg does command some
view of the Kreczor scene which at times was cardinal at others not
but Friedrich did not stand anywhere oftenest in the thick of the
fire say those who saw

Friedrich from his Inn near Planian seeing how Daun deploys himself
considers him impregnable on the left wing impregnable too in front
not so on the Kreczor side right flank and rear but capable of being
rolled together if well struck at there Thither therefore that is his
vulnerable point March along his front quietly parallel in due Order
of Battle till we can bend round and plunge in upon that The Van
which consists of Ziethens Horse and Hulsens Infantry Van having
faced to right at the proper moment and so become Left Wing will attack
Kreczor probably carry it each Division following will in like manner
face to right when it arrives there and fall on in regular succession
in support of Hulsen at Hulsens right flank if Hulsen be found
prospering our Right Wing is to refuse itself and be as a
Reserveno fighting on the road you others but steady towards
Hulsen in continual succession all you no facing round no fighting
anywhere till we get thitherMarch

The word is given about 2 PM and all on the instant is in motion
rolls steadily eastward in two columns which will become First Line
and Second One along the Highway the second at due distance leftward
on the green ground no hedge or other obstacle obstructing in that part
of the world Dauns batteries on the right spit at them in passing
to no purpose sputters of Pandour musketry from coverts there may
be Prussians finely disregarding pass along flowing tidelike towards
THEIR goal and place of choice An impressive phenomenon in the sunny
afternoon with Daun expectant of them and the Czech populations well
hidden underground

Ziethen vanmost of all finds Nadasti and his Austrian squadrons drawn
across the Highway hitherward of the Kreczor latitude Ziethen dashes
on Nadasti tumbles his squadrons and him away clears the Road and
Kreczor neighborhood of Nadasti drives him quite into the hollow of
Radowesnitz where he stood inactive for the rest of the day Hulsen now
at the level of Kreczor in the latitude of Kreczor as we phrased it
halts faces to right stiffly presses up opens his cannonthunders
his bayonetcharges and platoonfires upon Kreczor Stiffly pressing
up in spite of the violent counterthunders Hulsen does manage Kreczor
without very much delay completely enough and like a workman takes
the battery two batteries overturns the Infantryin a word has
seized Kreczor and as new tenant swept the old and their litter
quite out Of all which Ziethen has now the chase and by no means will
neglect that duty Ziethen driving the rout before him has driven it
in some minutes past the little Oakwood above mentioned and or
rather BUTwhat is much to be notedis there taken in flank with
cannonshot and musketry Daun having put batteries and Croat parties in
the Oakwood and is forced to draw bridle and get out of range again

Hulsen advancing towards this little Oakwood is surprised to
discover not the wood alone but a strong Austrian force foot and
horse to rear of itsuch had been Dauns and Nadastis precaution on
view of those Friedrich phenomena flowing on from Planian guessed to
be hitherward At sight of which Wood and footparty Hulsen no new
Battalion having yet arrived to second him pauses merely cannonading
from the distance till new Battalions shall arrive Unhappily they did
not arrive or not in due quantity at the set timefor what reason
by what strange mistake men still ask themselves Probably by more
mistakes than one Enough Hulsen struggling here all day with
reinforcements never adequate did take the Wood and then lose it did
take and lose this and thatbut was unable to make more of it than
keep his ground thereabouts A resolute man says Retzow but without
invention of his own or head to mend the mistakes of others In and
about Kreczor Hulsen did maintain himself with more and more tenacity
till the general avalanche fruit of sad mistakes swept HIM quite
spasmodically struggling at that period off to the edge of it and all
the others clean away Mistakes have been to rightwards one or even
two the fruit of which small at first suffices to turn the balance
and ends in an avalanche or precipitous descent of ruin on the Prussian
side

One mistake there was miles westward on the right wing due to
Mannstein our too impetuous Russian friend Mannstein well to right
while marching forward according to order has Croat musketry spitting
upon him from amid the high corn to an inconvenient extent such was
the common lot which others had borne and disregarded perhaps it
was beyond the average on Mannstein or Mannsteins patience was less
infinite any way it provoked Mannstein to boil over and in an evil
moment he said Extinguish me that Croat canaille then Regiment
Bornstedt faced to right accordingly took to extinguishing the Croat
canaille which of course fled at once or squatted closer but came
back with reinforcements drew Mannstein deeper in fatally delayed
Bornstedt and proved widely ruinous For now he stopped the way to
those following him regiments marching on to rear of Mannstein see
Mannstein halted volleying with the Austrians ask themselves How Is
there new order come Attack to be in this point And successively fall
on to support Mannstein as the one clear point in such dubiety So that
the whole right wing from Regiment Bornstedt westward is storming up
the difficult steeps in hot conflict with the Austrians there where
success against them had been judged impracticableand there is now
no reserve force anywhere to be applied to in emergency for Hulsens
behoof or anothers and the Plan of Battle from Mannstein westward has
been fatally overturned Poor Mannstein there is no doubt committed
this error being too fiery a man Surely to him it was no luxury
and he paid the smart for it in skin and soul badly wounded in this
business nay in direct sequel not many weeks after killed by it as
we shall see

To Mannsteins mistake Friedrich himself in his account of Kolin
mainly imputes the disaster that followed and such then and
afterwards was the universal judgment in military circles loading the
memory of too impetuous Mannstein with the whole See Retzow i
135 Templehof i 214 220 Much talk there was in Prussian military
circles but there must also have been an admirable silence on the part
of some To Three Persons it was known that another strange incident
had happened far ahead far eastward of Mannsteins position
incident which did not by any means tend to alleviate which could only
strengthen and widen the evil results of Mannstein and which might
have lifted part of the load from Mannsteins memory Not till the
present Century after the lapse of almost fifty years was this secret
slowly dug out of silence and submitted to modern curiosity

The incident is thisnever whispered of for near fifty years so
silent were the three and endlessly tossed about since that the sense
of it not understood till almost now See Retzow i 126 Berenhorst
c cthen FINALLY Kutzen pp 99 217 The three parties were
King Friedrich Moritz of Dessau leading on the centre here Moritzs
young Nephew Franz Heir of Dessau a brisk lad of seventeen learning
War here as Aidedecamp to Moritz the exact spot is not known to
meprobably the ground near that Inn of Slatislunz or GoldenSun
between the foot of FriedrichsBerg and thatfact indubitable though
kept dark so long Moritz is marching with the centre or main battle
that way intending to wheel and turn hillwards Kreczorwise as per
order certain furlongs ahead when Friedrich having so I can conceive
it seen from his Hilltop how Hulsen had done Kreczor altogether
prosperous there and what endless capability there was of prospering to
all lengths and speeding the general winning were Hulsen but supported
soon enough were there any safe shortcut to Hulsen dashed from his
Hilltop in hot haste towards Prince Moritz General of the centre
intending to direct him upon such shortcut and hastily said with
Olympian brevity and fire Face to right HERE With Jovelike brevity
and in such blaze of Olympian fire as we may imagine Moritz himself
is of brief crabbed fiery mind brief in temper and answers to the
effect Impossible to attack the enemy here your Majesty postured as
they are and we with such orders gone abroadFace to right I
tell you said the King still more Olympian and too emphatic for
explaining Moritz I hope paused but rather think he did not before
remonstrating the second time neither perhaps was his voice so low as
it should have been it is certain Friedrich dashed quite up to Moritz
at this second remonstrance flashed out his sword the only time he
ever drew his sword in battle and now gone all to mere Olympian
lightning and thundertone asks in THIS attitude WILL ER Will He
obey orders thenMoritz fallen silent of remonstrance with gloomy
rapidity obeys

Prince Franz the young Nephew of Moritz alone witnessed this scene
scene to be locked in threefold silence In his old age Franz had
whispered it to Berenhorst his bastard HalfUncle a famed military
Criticwho is still in the highest repute that way Berenhorsts
KRIEGSKUNST and other deep Books and is recognizable to LAY readers
for an abstruse strong judgment with equal strength of abstruse temper
hidden behind it and very privately a deep grudge towards Friedrich
scarcely repressible on opportunity From Berenhorst it irrepressibly
oozed out Heinrich van Berenhorst a natural son of the Old
Dessauers in his _Betrachtungen uber die Kriegskunst_ is the first
that alludes to it in print Leipzig 1797page in SECOND edition
1798 is i 219 much more to Friedrichs disadvantage than it now
looks when wholly seen into Not change of plan not ruinous caprice on
Friedrichs part as Berenhorst Retzow and others would have it only
excess of brevity towards Moritz and accident of the Olympian fire
breaking out Friedrich is chargeable with nothing except perhaps
what Moritz knows the evil of trying for a shortcut Such is now the
received interpretation Prince Franz to his last day refused to speak
again on the subject judiciously repentant we can fancy of having
spoken at all and brought such a matter into the streets and their
piepowder adjudications In KUTZEN pp 217237 a long dissertation
on it For the present he is Adjutant to Moritz busy obeying to the
letter

Friedrich withdrawing to his Height again and looking back on Moritz
finds that he is making right in upon the Austrian line which was by
no means Friedrichs meaning had not he been so brief Friedrich
doubtless with pain remembers now that he had said only Face to
right and had then got into Olympian tempest which left things dark
to Moritz HALBLINKS Half to left withal he despatches that new
order to Moritz with the utmost speed Face to right THEN forward
half to left Had Moritz at the first got that commentary to his
order there had probably been no remonstrance on Moritzs part
no Olympian scene to keep silent and Moritz taking that diagonal
direction from the first had hit in at or below Kreczor at the very
point where he was needed Alas for overhaste shortcuts if they are
to be good ought at least to be made clear Moritz on the new order
reaching him does instantly steer halfleft but he arrives now above
Kreczor strikes the Austrian line on this side of Kreczor disjoined
from Hulsen where he can do no good to Hulsen in brief Moritz and
now the whole line with him have to do as Mannstein and sequel are
doing attack in face not in flank and try what in the proportion of
one to two uphill and against batteries they can make of it in that
fashion

And so from right wing to left miles long there is now universal
storm of volleying bayonetcharging thunder of artillery caseshot
cartridgeshot and sulphurous devouring whirlwind the wrestle very
tough and furious especially on the assaulting side Here as at Prag
the Prussian troops were one and all in the fire each doing strenuously
his utmost no complaint to be made of their performance More perfect
soldiers I believe were rarely or never seen on any field of war But
there is no reserve left Mannstein and the rest who should have been
reserve and at a Generals disposal we see what they are doing In
vain or nearly so is Friedrichs tactic or manoeuvring talent what
now is there to manoeuvre All is now gone up into one combustion To
fan the fire to be here there fanning the fire where need shows this
is now Friedrichs function everywhere in the hottest of the fight
that is all we at present know of him invisible to us otherwise This
deathwrestle lasted perhaps four hours till seven or towards eight
oclock in the June evening the sun verging downwards issue still
uncertain

And in fact at last the issue turned upon a hairsuch the empire of
Chance in War matters Cautious Daun it is well known did not like the
aspect of the thing cautious Daun thinks to himself If we get pushed
back into that Camp of yesternight down the Kamhayek Heights and right
into the impassable swamps the reverse way Heights now HIS not
ours and impassable swamps waiting to swallow us Wreck complete and
surrender at discretion Daun writes in pencil The retreat is to
Suchdol Kuttenberg way southward where we have heights again and
magazines Dauns Aidedecamp is galloping everywhither with
that important Document and Generals are preparing for retreat
accordinglyone General on the right wing has visibly to Hulsen and
us his cannon out of battery and under way rearwards a welcome sight
to Hulsen who with imperfect reinforcement is toughly maintaining
himself there all day

And now the Daun Aidedecamp so Chance would have it cannot find
Nostitz the Saxon Commandant of Horse in that quarter finds a Saxon
LieutenantColonel B Benkendorf all Books now write him plainly
who by another little chance had been still left there Can the Herr
LieutenantColonel tell me where General Nostitz is Benkendorf can
tellwill himself take the message but Benkendorf looks into the
important Pencil Document thinks it premature wasteful and that the
contrary is feasible persuades Nostitz so to think persuades this
regiment and that Saxon Austrian horse and foot though the cannon
in retreat go trundling past them Merely shifting their battery dont
you seeSteady And in fine organizes of Saxon and Austrian horse
and foot in promising quantity Saxons in great fury on the Pirna score
not to say the Striegau and other old grudges a new unanimous assault
on Hulsen

The assault was furious and became ever more so at length irresistible
to Hulsen Hulsens horse pressing on as to victory are at last hurled
back could not be rallied That of RUCKER WOLLT IHR EWIG LEBEN
Rascals would you live forever with the Fritz for eight groschen
this day there has been enoughis to be counted pure myth not
unsuccessful in its withered kind fairly fled some of them
confusing Hulsens footfoot is broken instantly ranks itself as the
manner of Prussians is ranks itself in impromptu squares and stands
fiercely defensive again amid the slashing and careering wrestle of
extreme fury say the witnesses This for Striegau cried the Saxon
dragoons furiously sabring Archenholtz i 100 Yes and is there
nothing to account of Pirna and the later scores Scores unliquidated
very many still but the end is Hulsen is driven away retreats
Parthianlike downhill some space whose sad example has to spread
rightwards like a powdertrain till all are in retreatnorthward
towards Nimburg is the roadand the Battle of Kolin is finished

Friedrich made vehement effort to rally the Horse to rally this and
that but to no purpose one account says he did collect some small
body and marched forth at the head of it against a certain battery
but in his rear man after man fell away till LieutenantColonel Grant
not Le Grand as some call him and indeed there is an ACCENT of
Scotch in him still audible to us here had to remark Your Majesty
and I cannot take the battery ourselves Upon which Friedrich turned
round and finding nobody looked at the Enemy through his glass and
slowly rode away Retzow i 139on a different errand

Seeing the Battle irretrievably lost he now called Bevern and Moritz
to him gave them charge of the retreatTo Nimburg cross Elbe there
fifteen good miles away and in the defiles of Planian have especial
care and himself rode off thitherward his GardeduCorps escorting
Retzow says a swarm of fugitive horsesoldiers baggagepeople
grooms and led horses gathered in the train of him these latter at one
point Retzow has heard in Opposition circles rushed up galloping
Enemys hussars upon us and set the whole party to the gallop for
some time till they found the alarm was false Ib i 140 Of
Friedrich we see nothing except as if by cloudy moonlight in an
uncertain manner through this and the other small Anecdote perhaps
semimythical and true only in the essence of it

Daun gave no chase anywhere on his extreme left he had perhaps as
preparative for chasing ordered out the cavalry General Stampach and
cavalry from the centre with cannon with infantry and appliances to
clear away the wrecks of Mannstein and what still stands to right of
him on the Planian Highway yonder But Stampach found obstacles
of ground wet obstacles and also dryPrussian posts smaller and
greater who would not stir a handbreadth in fact an altogether
deadly storm of Negative spontaneous on their part from the indignant
regiments thereabouts Kings First Battalion and two others who
blazed out on Stampach in an extraordinary manner tearing to shreds
every attempt of his themselves stiff as steel Die all of us rather
than stir And in fact the second man of these poor fellows did
die there Kutzen p 138 from the canonical or STAFFOFFICERS
enumeration see SUPRA p 403 n So that Bevern Commander in that
part who was absent speaking with the King found on his return a new
battle broken out which he did not forbid but encourage till Stampach
had enough and withdrew in rather torn condition This if this were
some preparative for chasing was what Daun did of it in the cavalry
way and this was all The infantry he strictly prohibited to stir from
their positionNo saying if we come into the level ground with such
an enemyand passed the night under arms Far on our left or what
was once our left Ziethen with all his squadrons nay Hulsen with most
of his battalions continued steady on the ground and marched away at
their leisure as rearguard

It seemed says Tempelhof in splenetic tone as if Feldmarschall
Daun like a good Christian would not suffer the sun to go down on his
wrath This day nearly the longest in the year he allowed the Prussian
cavalry which had beaten Nadasti to stand quiet on the field till ten
at night till nine he did not send a single hussar in chase of the
infantry He stood all night under arms and next day returned to his
old Camp as if he had been afraid the King would come back Arriving
there himself he could see about ten in the morning behind Kaurzim
and Planian the whole Prussian Baggage fallen into such a coil that the
wagons were with difficulty got on way again nevertheless he let
it under cover of the grenadier battalion Manteuffel go in peace
Tempelhof i 195 A man that for caution and slowness could make no
use of his victory

The Austrian force in the Field this day is counted to have been 60000
their losses in killed wounded and missing 8114 The Prussians who
began 34000 in strength lost 13773 of whom prisoners including all
the wounded 5380 Their baggage we have seen was not meddled with
they lost 45 cannon 22 flagsa loss not worth adding in comparison
to this sore havoc for the second time in the flower of the Prussian
Infantry Retzow i 141 whose numbers are apt to be inaccurate
Kutzen p 144 who depends on the Canonical STAFFOFFICER Account

The news reached Prag Camp at two in the morning Sunday 19th to the
sorrowful amazement of the Generals there who stood all silent
only the Prince of Prussia breaking out into loud lamentations and
accusations which even Retzow thinks unseemly Friedrich arrived that
Sunday evening and the Siege was raised next day with next to no
hindrance or injury With none at all on the part of Daun who was still
standing among the heights and swamps of Planianbusy singing or
shooting universal TEDEUM with very great rolling fire and other
pomp that day while Friedrich gathered his Siegegoods and got on
march




THE MARIATHERESA ORDER NEW KNIGHTHOOD FOR AUSTRIA

No tongue can express the joy of the Austrians over this
victoryvouchsafed them in this manner by LieutenantColonel
Benkendorf and the Powers above Miraculously behold they are not upon
the retreat to Suchdol at doublequick and in ragged everlengthening
line but stand here keeping rank all night on the PlanianKolin
upland of the Kamhayekbehold they have actually beaten Friedrich
for the first time not been beaten by him Clearly beaten that
Friedrich by some means or other With such a result too consider
itdrawn sword was at our throat and marvellously now it is turned
round upon his if Daun be alert and welet us rejoice to all
lengths and sing TEDEUM and TEDAUNUM with one throat till the
Heavens echo again

 There was quite a hurricane or lengthened storm of jubilation
and tripudiation raised at Vienna on this victory New ORDER OF MARIA
THERESA in suitable Olympian fashion with no end of regulating and
inauguratingwith Daun the first Chief of it and Pensions to Merit
a conspicuous part of the plan we are glad to see It subsists to this
day the grandest Military Order the Austrians yet have Which
then deafened the world with its infinite solemnities patentings
discoursings trumpetings for a good while As was natural surely to
that high Imperial Lady with the magnanimous heart to that loyal solid
Austrian People with its puddinghead Daun is at the top of the Theresa
Order and of military renown in Vienna circlesof LieutenantColonel
Benkendorf I never heard that he got the least pension or
recognitioncontinued quietly a military lion to discerning men for
the rest of his days Died at Dresden General of Cavalry 5th May
1801 Rodenbeck i 338 339

Nay once on Dauus TEDEUM day he had a kind of recognitionand
even by good accident can tell us of it in his own words Kutzen
citing some BIOGRAPHY of Benkendorf p 143

I was sent for to headquarters by a trumpeterBenkendorf
waswhen all was ready for the TEDEUM Feldmarschall Daun was
pleased to say at sight of me That as I had had so much to do with the
victory it was but right I should thank our Herr Gott along with him
Having no change of clothesas the servant who was to have a uniform
and some linens ready for me had galloped off during the Fight and our
baggage was all gone to rearwardI tried to hustle out of sight among
the crowd of Imperial Officers all in gala but the reigning Duke of
Wurtemberg Wilhelminas Soninlaw a perverse obstinate Herr growing
ever more perverse one of Wilhelminas sad afflictions in these days
called me to him and said He would give his whole wardrobe could he
wear that dusty coat with such honor as Iyes and tried hard in
his perverse way for some such thing but never could as we shall see

How lucky that Polish Majesty had some remains of Cavalry still at
Warsaw in the Pirna time that they were made into a Saxon Brigade and
taken into the Austrian service Brigade of three Regiments Nostitz for
Chief and this Benkendorf a LieutenantColonel among themand that
Polish Majesty though himself lost has been the saving of Austria
twice within one year




Chapter VFRIEDRICH AT LEITMERITZ HIS WORLD OF ENEMIES COMING ON

Of Friedrichs nightthoughts at Nimburg how he slept and what his
dreams were we have no account Seldom did a wearied heart sink down
into oblivion on such terms By narrow miss the game gone and with
such results ahead It was a right valiant plunge this that he made
with all his strength and all his skill home upon the heart of his
chief enemy To quench his chief enemy before another came up it was
a valiant plan and valiantly executed and it has failed To dictate
peace from the walls of Vienna that lay on the cards for him this
morning and at night Kolin is lost the fruit of Prag Victory too is
lost and Schwerin and new tens of thousands unreplaceable for worth
in this world are lost much is lost Courage your Majesty all is not
lost you not and honor not

To the young Graf von Anhalt on the road to Nimburg he is recorded to
have said Dont you know then that every man must have his reverses
MAIS NE SAVEZVOUS DONC PAS QUE CHAQUE HOMME DOIT AVOIR SES REVERS
It appears I am to have mine Rodenbeck i 309 And more vaguely
in the AnecdoteBooks is mention of some stanch ruggedly pious old
Dragoon who brought in his steel cap from some fineflowing well he
had discovered a draught of pure water to the King old Mother Earths
own gift through her rugged Dragoon exquisite refection to the thirsty
wearied soul and spoke in his Dragoon dialectNever mind your
Majesty DER ALLMACHTIGE and we It shall be mended yet The Kaiserin
may get a victory for once but does that send us to the Devil DAVON
HOLT UNS DER TEUFELNICHTwords of rough comfort which were well
taken

Next morning several Books and many Drawings and Sculptures of a dim
unsuccessful nature give us view of him at Kimburg sitting silent
on a BRUNNENROHR Fountain Apparatus wastepipe or feedingpipe
too high for convenient sitting he is stooping forward there his
eyes fixed on the ground and is scratching figures in the sand with his
stick as the broken troops reassemble round him Archenholtz says He
surveyed with speechless feeling the small remnant of his Lifeguard of
Foot favorite First Battalion 1000 strong yesterday morning hardly
400 nowgone the others in that furious AntiStampach outburst
which ended the days work All soldiers of this chosen Battalion were
personally known to him their names their age native place their
history the pick of his Ruppin regiment was the basis of it in one
day Death had mowed them down they had fought like heroes and it was
for him that they had died His eyes were visibly wet down his face
rolled silent tears Archenholtz i 104 101 Kutzen pp 259 138
Retzow i 142

In public I never saw other tears from this Kingthough in private
I do not warrant him his sensibilities little as you would think it
being very lively and intense To work however This King can shake
away such things and is not given overmuch to retrospection on
the unalterable Past Like dewdrops from the lions mane as is
figuratively said the lion swiftly rampant again There was manifold
swift ordering considering and determining at Nimburg that day and
towards night Friedrich shot rapidly into Headquarters at Prag where
by order there is as the first thing of all a very rapid business
going on well forward by the time he arrives

To fold ones Siegegear and Army neatly together from those Two
Hilltops and march away with them safe in sight of so many enemies
this has to be the first and rapidest thing if this be found possible
as one calculates it may After which the world of enemies held in
the slip so long will rush in from all the four windsunknown
whitherward one must wait to see whitherward and how

Friedrichs History for the remaining six months of this Year falls
accordingly into three Sections Section FIRST Waiting how and
towards what objects his enemies the Austrians first of all will
advancethis lasts for about a month Friedrich waiting mainly at
Leitmeritz on guard there both of Saxony and of Silesia till this
slowly declare itself Slowly perhaps almost stupidly but by no means
satisfactorily to Friedrich as will be seen After which Section
SECOND of his History lasts above two months Friedrichs enemies being
all got to the ground and united in hope and resolution to overwhelm
and abolish him but their plans positions operations so extremely
various that for a long time end of August to beginning of November
Friedrich cannot tell what to do with them and has to scatter himself
into thin threads and roam about chiefly in Thuringen and the West of
Saxony seeking something to fight with and finding nothing getting
more and more impatient of such paltry misery at times nigh desperate
and habitually drifting on desperation as on a lee shore in the night
despite all his efforts Till in Section THIRD which goes from
November 5th through December 5th and into the New Year he does find
what to do and does itin a forever memorable way

Three Sections of which the reader shall successively have some idea
if he exert himself though it is only in snatches suggestive to an
active fancy that we can promise to dwell on them especially on the
First Two which lie pretty much unsurveyable in those chaotic records
like a worldwide coil of thrums Let us be swift in Friedrichs own
manner and try to disimprison the small portions of essential Here
partly from Eyewitnesses are some Notes in regard to Section First
Westphalen _Geschichte der Feldzuge des Herzogs Ferdinand _ and a
Private Journal of Ws there ii 1319 Retzow c

SUNDAY 19th JUNE At 2 AM Major Grant arrives at Prag must have

at leastand set instantly to work On both Hills the cannons are
removed across Moldau the ZiscaHill ones batteries destroyed
Siegegear neatly gathered up to go in wagons to Leitmeritz thence
by boat to Dresden all this lies ready done the dangerous part of it
done when Friedrich arrives

MONDAY 20th before sunrise Siege raised At three in the morning
Friedrich marches from the Ziscaberg to eastward he to AltBunzlau
thence to AhLissaNimburg way with what objects we shall see
Marshal Keiths fine performance Keith from the Weissenberg does not
march such packing and loading still all the baggages and artilleries
being with Keith Not till four in the afternoon did Keith march but
beautifully then and folded himself awayrearguard under Schmettau
retreating checkerwise nothing but Tolpatcheries attempting on
himwestward Budinward without loss of a linstock not to speak of
guns Very prettily done on the part of Keith By Budin to Leitmeritz
he where the King will join him shortly

Friedrichs errand in AltLissa eastward while Keith went westward
was To be within due armslength of the MoritzBevern or beaten Kolin
Army which is coming up that way intending to take post and do its
best in those parts with Zittau Magazine and the Lausitz to rear

TUESDAY 28th Junction with KeithBridge rightly secured due party

covers Leitmeritz Clearing of the Pascopol that is sweeping the
Pandours out of it is the first business Colonel Loudon with his
Pandours a most swift sharpcutting man being now here in those parts
doing a deal of mischief Three days ago Saturday 25th Keith had sent
seven battalions with the proper steelbesoms on that Pascopol affair

if some little highway robbery still went on among the Mountains up
there

From Prag onwards here has been a delicate set of operations perfectly
executedthanks to Friedrichs rapidity of shift and also to the
cautious slowly puzzling mind of Daun Had Daun used any diligence
had Daun and Prince Karl been broad awake together or even singly But
Friedrich guessed they seldom or never were that they would spend
some days in puzzling and that with despatch he would have time for
everything Daun we could observe stood singing TEDEUM greatly at
leisure in his old Camp 20th June while Friedrich from the first
gray of morning and diligently all day long was withdrawing from the
trenches of PragFriedrichs people self and goods getting folded
out in the finest gradation and with perfect success no Daun to hinder
himDaun leisurely doing TEDEUM forty miles off helping on the
WRONG side by that exertion Cogniazzo ii 367Poor Browne he
is dead of his wounds in Prag yonder writes Westphalen in his
Leitmeritz Journal news came to us July 1st men said Ah that was
why they lay asleep

Till June 26th Daun and Karl had not united nor except sending out
Loudon and Croats done anything either of them Sunday June 26th
at Podschernitz on the old Field of Prag a week and a day after Kolin
they did get together still seemingly a little puzzled Shall we
follow the King Shall we follow Moritz and Bevernnothing clear for
some time except to send out Pandour parties upon both Moritz since
parting with the King in AltBunzlau neighborhood has gone northward
some marches thirty miles or so to JUNGBunzlaumeeting of Iser
and Elbe surely a good positionMoritz on receipt of these Pandour
allowances of his writes to the King Shall we retreat on Zittau
then your Majesty Straight upon Zittau Fancy Friedrichs
astonishmentwho well intends to eat the Country first perhaps to
fight if there be chance and at least to lie OUTSIDE the doors of
Silesia and the Lausitz as well as of Saxony hereand answers with
his own hand on the instant Your Dilection will not be so mad
In Preuss ii 58 the pungent little Autograph in full And at
once recalls Moritz and appoints the Prince of Prussia to go and
take command Who directly wenta most important step for the Kings
interests and his own Whose fortunes in that business we shall see
before long

At Leitmeritz the King continues four weeks with his Army parted in
this way waiting how the endless hostile element which begirdles his
horizon all round will shape itself into combinations that he may
set upon the likeliest or the needfulest of these when once it has
disclosed itself Horizon all round is black enough Austrians French
Swedes Russians Reichs Army closer upon him or not so close all are
rolling in Saxony the Lausitz and Silesia Brandenburg itself it is
uncertain which of these may soonest require his active presence

The very day after his arrival in LeitmeritzTuesday 28th June while
that junction with Keith was going on and the troops were defiling
along the Bridge for junction with Keitha heavy sorrow had befallen
him which he yet knew not of An irreparable Domestic loss sad
complement to these Military and other Public disasters Queen Sophie
Dorothee about whose health he had been anxious but had again been
set quiet died at Berlin that day Monbijou 28th June 1757 born at
Hanover 27th March 1687 In her seventyfirst year of no definite
violent disease worn down with chagrins and apprehensions in this
black whirlpool of Public troubles So far as appears the news came on
Friedrich by surprisebad cough we hear of and of his anxieties
about it in the Spring time then again of improvement recovery in
the fine weatherno thought just now of such an event and he took
it with a depth of affliction which my less informed readers are far
from expecting of him

July 2d the news came King withdrew into privacy to weep and bewail
under this new pungency of grief superadded to so many others Mitchell
says For two days he had no levee only the Princes dined with him
Princes Henri and Ferdinand Prince of Prussia is gone to JungBunzlau
would get the sad message there among his other troubles yesterday
July 3d King sent for me in the afternoonthe first time he has seen
anybody since the news cameI had the honor to remain with him some
hours in his closet I must own to your Lordship I was most sensibly
afflicted to see him indulging his grief and giving way to the warmest
filial affections recalling to mind the many obligations he had to her
late Majesty all she had suffered and how nobly she bore it the good
she did to everybody the one comfort he now had to think of having
tried to make her last years more agreeable _Papers and Memoirs_ i
253 Despatch to Holderness 4th July slightly abridgedsee ib
i 357359 Private Journal Westphalen ii 14 See _OEuvres de
Frederic_ iv 182 In the thick of public business this kind of mood
to Mitchell seems to have lasted all the time of Leitmeritz which is
about three weeks yet Mitchells Notebooks and Despatches in that
part have a fine Biographic interest the wholly human Friedrich
wholly visible to us there as he seldom is Going over his past Life to
Mitchell brief candid pious to both his Parentsinexpressibly sad
like moonlight on the grave of ones Mother silent that while so much
else is too noisy

This Friedrich upon whom the whole world has risen like a mad
SorcerersSabbath how safe he once lay in his cradle like the rest of
us mothers love wrapping him softand now These thoughts commingle
in a very tragic way with the avalanche of public disasters which is
thundering down on all sides Warm tears the meed of this new sorrow
small in compass but greater in poignancy than all the rest together
My poor old Mother oh my Mother that so loved me always and would
have given her own life to shelter mineIt was at Leitmeritz as
I guess that Mitchell first made decisive acquaintance what we
may almost call intimacy with the King we already defined him as a
sagacious longheaded loyalhearted diplomatic gentleman Scotch by
birth and by turn of character abundantly polite vigilant discreet
and with a fund of general sense and rugged veracity of mind whom
Friedrich at once recognized for what he was and much took to finding
a hearty return withal so that they were soon well with one another
and continued so Mitchell as orders were attended the Kings person
all through this War sometimes in the blaze of battle itself and
nothing but cannonshot going if it so chanced and has preserved in
his multifarious Papers a great many traits of Friedrich not to be met
with elsewhere

Mitchells occasional society conversation with a man of sense and
manly character which Friedrich always much loved was no doubt a
resource to Friedrich in his lonely roamings and vicissitudes in those
dark years No other British Ambassador ever had the luck to please him
or be pleased by himmost of them as ExExchequer Legge and the like
ExParliamentary people he seems to have considered dull obstinate
wooden fellows of fantastic abrupt rather abstruse kind of character
not worth decipheringsome of them as Hanbury Williams with the
mischievous tic more like galvanism or StVitusdance which he
called wit and the inconvenient turn for plotting and intriguing
Friedrich could not endure at all but had them as soon as possible
recalledof course not without detestation on their part

At Leitmeritz it appears he kept withdrawn to his closet a good deal
gave himself up to his sorrows and his thoughts would sit many hours
drowned in tears weeping bitterly like a child or a woman This is
strange to some readers but it is trueand ought to alter certain
current notions Friedrich flashing like clear steel upon evildoers and
mendacious unjust persons and their works is not by nature a cruel
man then or an unfeeling as Rumor reports Reader no far the
reverseand public Rumor as you may have remarked is apt to be an
extreme blockhead full of fury and stupidity on such points and
had much better hold its tongue till it know in some measure Extreme
sensibility is not sure to be a merit though it is sure to be reckoned
one by the greedy dim fellows looking idly on but in any case the
degree of it that dwelt privately for most part in Friedrich was
great and to himself it seemed a sad rather than joyful fact Speaking
of this matter long afterwards to Garve a Silesian Philosopher with
whom he used to converse at Breslau he saysor let dull Garve himself
report it in the literal thirdperson

And herein I the Herr Garve venturing to dispute or qualify on
one of his Majestys favorite topics believe lies the real ground
of happiness it is the capacity and opportunity to accomplish
great things This the King would not allow but said That I did
not sufficiently take into account the natural feelings different
in different people which when painful imbittered the life of the
highest as of the lowest That in his own life he had experienced the
deepest sufferings of this kind And added he with a touching
tone of kindness and familiarity which never occurred again in his
interviews with me if you ER knew for instance what I underwent on
the death of my Mother you would see that I have been as unhappy as any
other and unhappier than others because of the greater sensibility
I had WEIL ICH MEHR EMPFINDLICHKEIT GEHABT HABE _Fragmente zur

unexpectedly dull Book Garve having talent and reputation kind of
monotonous Preachment upon Friedrichs character almost nothing but the
above fraction now derivable from it

There needed not this new calamity in Friedrichs lot just now From all
points of the compass his enemies held in check so long are floating
on the confluence of disasters and illtidings at this time very
great From JungBunzlau close by his Brothers accounts are bad and
grow ever worseas will be seen On the extreme West July 3d while
Friedrich at Leitmeritz sat weeping for his Mother the French take
Embden from him July 5th the Russians Memel on the utmost East
June 30th six days before the Russians after as many months of
haggling did cross the Border 37000 of them on this point and set
to bombarding Memel from land and sea Poor Memel garrison only 700
answered very fiercely sank two of their gunboats and the like but
the end was as we seeFeldmarschall Lehwald able to give no relief
For there were above 70000 other Russians Feldmarschall Apraxin with
these latter and Cossacks and Calmucks more than enough
crossing elsewhere south in Tilsit Country upon old Lehwald
_HeldenGeschichte_ iv 407413 Lehwald with 30000 in such
circumstanceswhat is to become of Preussen and him Nearer hand
the Austrians the French the very Reichs Army do now seem intent on
business

The Reichs Execution Army we saw how Mayer and the Battle of Prag had
checked it in the birthpangs and given rise to pangs of another sort
the poor Reichs Circles generally exclaiming What Bring the war into
our own borders Bring the King of Prussia on our own throatsand
stopping short in their enlistments and preparations in vain for
Austrian Officials to urge them Watching there with awestruck eye
while the 12000 bombs flew into Prag

The Battle of Kolin has reversed all that and the poor old Reich is
again bent on business in the Execution way Drumming committeeing
projecting and endeavoring with all her might in all quarters and
from and after the event of Kolin holding visible Encampment in the
Nurnberg Country fractions of actual troops assembling there On
the Plains of Furth between Furth and Farrenbach east side the River
Regnitz there was the Camp pitched says my Anonymous Friend who

of the ReichsHeer Bishops remarks not given August 10th came
the young reigning Duke of Hildburghausen Dukes granduncle is to be
Commander on like errand August 11th the ReichsHeer got on march
Westward horeaders will see towards what

A truly ELENDE or miserable Reichs Execution Army as the MISprinter
had made it but giving loud voice in the Gazettes and urged by every
consideration to do something for itself Prince of Hildburghausena
general of small merit though he has risen in the Austrian service
and we have seen him with Seckendorf in old Turk timeshas for his
Kaisers sake taken the command sensible perhaps that glory is not
likely to be rife here but willing to make himself useful Kaiser
and Austria urge everywhere with all their might Prince of
HessenDarmstadt who lay on the Weissenberg lately one of Keiths
distinguished seconds there and a Prussian Officer of long standing
has on Kaisers order quitted all that and become Hildburghausens
second here in the Camp of Furth thinking the path of duty lay that
waythough his Wife one of the noble women of her age thought very
differently Her Letter to Friedrich Berlin 30th October 1757
_OEuvres de Frederic_ xxvii ii 135 A similar Kaisers order backed
by what Lawthunder lay in the Reich had gone out against Friedrichs
own Brothers and against every Reichs Prince who was in Friedrichs
service but except him of HessenDarmstadt none of them had much
minded In Orlich _Furst Moritz von Anhalt Dessau_ Berlin 1842
pp 74 75 Prince Moritzs rather mournful Letter on the subject with
Friedrichs sharp Answer I did not hear that his strategic talent was
momentous but Prussia had taught him the routine of right soldiering
surely to small purpose and Friedrich no doubt glanced indignantly at
this small thing among the many big ones

From about the end of June the Reichs Army kept dribbling in the most
inferior Army in the world no part of it well drilled most of it
not drilled at all and for variety in color condition method
and military and pecuniary and other outfit beggaring description
Hildburghausen does his utmost Kaiser the like The number should
have far exceeded 50000 but was not on the field of above half that
number 25000 add at least 8000 Austrian troops two regiments of
them cavalry good these 8000 the rest badthat was the Reichs
Execution Army most inferior among Armies and considerable part of it
all the Protestant part privately wishing well to Friedrich they say
Drills itself multifariously in that Camp between Furth and Farrenbach
on the east side of Regnitz River Fancy what a sight to Wilhelmina if
she ever drove that way which I think she hardly would The Baireuth
contingent itself is there the Margraf would have held out stiff
on that point but Friedrich himself advised compliance Margraf of
Anspachperverse tippling creature ill with his Wife I doubthas
joyfully sent his legal hundreds will vote for the Reichs Ban against
this worst of Germans whom he has for Brotherinlaw Dark days in the
heart of Wilhelmina those of the Camp at Furth Days which grow ever
darker with strange flashings out of empyrean lightning from that
shrill true heart no peace more till the noble heroine die

This ELENDE ReichsHeer miserable Army of the Circles is mockingly
called the Hoopers Coopers TONNELIERS and gets quizzing enough
under that and other titles from an Opposition Public Far other from
the French and Austrians who are bent that it should do feats in the
world and prove impressive on a robber King Thus too for Deliverance
of Saxony to cooperate with ReichsHeer in that sacred object thanks
to the zeal of Pompadour Prince de Soubise has got together in Elsass
a supplementary 30000 40330 said Theory but Fact never quite so
many and is passing them across the Rhine in Frankfurt Country all
through July while the drilling at Furth goes on With these Soubise
simultaneously getting under way will steer northeastward join the
ReichsHeer about Erfurt before August end andand we shall see what
becomes of the combined Soubise and Reichs Army after that

It must be owned the French Pompadour and love of glory urging are
diligent since the event of Kolin In select Parisian circles the
Soubise Army or even that of DEstrees altogetherproduced by
the tears of a filial Dauphinessis regarded as a quasisacred
or uncommonly noble thing and is called by her name LARMEE DE LA
DAUPHINE or for shortness LA DAUPHINE without adjunct Thus like a
kind of chivalrous Bellona vengeance in her right hand tears and
fire in her eyes the DAUPHINESS advances and will join ReichsHeer
at Erfurt before August end Such the will of Pompadour Richelieu
encouraging for reasons of his own Soubise I understand is privately
in pique against poor DEstrees Reappeared unexpectedly in Paris

Bielefeld set forth in the cool of night 60000 strong and
10000 more to join him by the road the rest are left as garrisons
reserves1000 marauders of them swing as monitory pendulums on their
various trees for one itemdirect towards Hanover and Royal Highness
of Cumberland who retreats and has retreated behind the Ems the
Weser back ever back and to appearance will make a bad finish
yonder

To Friedrich waiting at Leitmeritz all these things are gloomily
known but the most pressing of them is that of the Austrians and
JungBunzlau close by Let us give some utterances of his to Wilhelmina
nearly all we have of direct from him in that time and then hasten to
the Prince of Prussia there

Newspapers or some such road

JULY 5th By a Courier of Plothos returning to Regensburg who passes
near you I write to apprise my dear Sister of the new misery which
overwhelms us We have no longer a Mother This loss puts the crown on
my sorrows I am obliged to act and have not time to give free course
to my tears Judge I pray you of the situation of a feeling heart
put to so cruel a trial All losses in the world are capable of being
remedied but those which Death causes are beyond the reach of hope

JULY 7th You are too good I am ashamed to abuse your indulgence But
do since you will try to sound the French what conditions of Peace
they would demand one might judge as to their intentions Send that
Mirabeau CE M DE MIRABEAU to France Willingly will I pay the

LEITMERITZ 13th July 1757

MY DEAREST SISTERYour Letter has arrived I see in it your regrets
for the irreparable loss we have had of the best and worthiest Mother
in this world I am so struck down with all these blows from within and
without that I feel myself in a sort of Stupefaction

The French have just laid hold of Friesland seized Embden July 3d
are about to pass the Weser they have instigated the Swedes to declare
War against me the Swedes are sending 17000 men rather more if
anything but they proved beautifully ineffectual into Pommernwill
be burdensome to Stralsund and the poor country people mainly having
no Captain over them but a hydraheaded National Palaver at home and
a Longpole with Cockedhat on it here at hand The Russians are
besieging Memel have taken it ten days ago Lehwald has them on his
front and in his rear The Troops of the Reich from your Plains
of Furth yonder are also about to march All this will force me to
evacuate Bohemia so soon as that crowd of Enemies gets into motion

I am firmly resolved on the extremest efforts to save my Country We
shall see QUITTE A VOIR if Fortune will take a new thought or if she
will entirely turn her back upon me Happy the moment when I took to
training myself in philosophy There is nothing else that can sustain
the soul in a situation like mine I spread out to you dear Sister
the detail of my sorrows if these things regarded only myself I could
stand it with composure but I am bound Guardian of the safety and
happiness of a People which has been put under my charge There lies the
sting of it and I shall have to reproach myself with every fault if
by delay or by overhaste I occasion the smallest accident all the
more as at present any fault may be capital

What a business Here is the liberty of Germany and that Protestant
Cause for which so much blood has been shed here are those Two great
Interests again at stake and the pinch of this huge game is such that
an unlucky quarter of an hour may establish over Germany the tyrannous
domination of the House of Austria forever I am in the case of a
traveller who sees himself surrounded and ready to be assassinated by a
troop of cutthroats who intend to share his spoils Since the League
of Cambrai 15081510 with a Pope in it and a Kaiser and Most Christian
King iniquitously sworn against poor Veniceto no purpose as happily
appears there is no example of such a Conspiracy as that infamous
Triumvirate Austria France Russia now forms against me Was it ever
seen before that three great Princes laid plot in concert to destroy
a Fourth who had done nothing against them I have not had the least
quarrel either with France or with Russia still less with Sweden If
in common life three citizens took it into their heads to fall upon
their neighbor and burn his house about him they very certainly
by sentence of tribunal would be broken on the wheel What and will
Sovereigns who maintain these tribunals and these laws in their States
give such example to their subjects Happy my dear Sister is the
obscure man whose good sense from youth upwards has renounced all
sorts of glory who in his safe low place has none to envy him and
whose fortune does not excite the cupidity of scoundrels

But these reflections are vain We have to be what our birth which
decides has made us in entering upon this world I reckoned that being
King it beseemed me to think as a Sovereign and I took for principle
that the reputation of a Prince ought to be dearer to him than life
They have plotted against me the Court of Vienna has given itself the
liberty of trying to maltreat me my honor commanded me not to suffer
it We have come to War a gang of robbers falls on me pistol in hand
that is the adventure which has happened to me The remedy is difficult
in desperate diseases there are no methods but desperate ones

I beg a thousand pardons dear Sister in these three long pages I talk
to you of nothing but my troubles and affairs A strange abuse it would
be of any other persons friendship But yours my dear Sister yours
is known to me and I am persuaded you are not impatient when I open
my heart to youa heart which is yours altogether being filled with
sentiments of the tenderest esteem with which I am my dearest Sister
your in truth affectionate Brother at all times F _OEuvres de

PRINCE AUGUST WILHELM FINDS A BAD PROBLEM AT JUNGBUNZLAU AND DOES IT
BADLY FRIEDRICH THEREUPON HAS TO RISE FROM LEITMERITZ AND TAKE THE
FIELD ELSEWHERE IN BITTER HASTE AND IMPATIENCE WITH OUTLOOKS WORSE
THAN EVER

The Prince of Prussias Enterprise had its intricacies but by
good management was capable of being done At least so Friedrich
thoughtthough in truth it would have been better had Friedrich gone
himself since the chief pressure happened to fall there The Prince has
to retire Parthianlike as slowly as possible with the late Kolin or
MoritzBevern Army towards the Lausitz keeping his eye upon Silesia
the while of course securing the passes and strong places in his
passage for defence of his own rear at lowest especially securing
Zittau a fine opulent Town where his chief Magazine is fed from
Silesia now The Army is in good strength guess 30000 with every
equipment complete in discipline in health and in heart such as
beseems a Prussian Armyprobably longing rather if it venture to
long or wish for anything not yet commanded to have a stroke at those
Austrians again and pay them something towards that late Kolin score

The Prince arrived at JungBunzlau June 30th Winterfeld with him and
at his own request Schmettau The Austrians have not yet stirred if
they do it may be upon the King it may be upon the Prince in three or
even in two marches Prince and King can be togetherthe King only too
happy in the present oppressive coil of doubts to find the Austrians
ready for a new passage of battle and an immediate decision The
Austrians did in fact break outseemingly at first upon the King
but in reality upon the Prince whom they judge safer game and the
matter became much more critical upon him than had been expected

The Prince was thought to have a good judgment too much talk in it we
sometimes feared and fair knowledge in military matters The King
not quite by the Princes choice has given him Winterfeld for Mentor
Winterfeld who has an excellent military head in such matters and
a heart firm as steelalmost like a second self in the Kings
estimation Excellent Winterfeldbut then there are also Schmettau
Bevern and others possibly in private not too well affected to this
Winterfeld In fact there is rather a multitude of Counsellersand an
ingenuous finespirited Prince perhaps more capable of eloquence on
the Opposition side than of condensing into real wisdom a multitude
of counsels when the crisis rises and the affair becomes really
difficult Crisis did rise the victorious Austrians after such delay
had finally made up their minds to press this one a little this one
rather than the King and hang upon his skirts Daun and Prince Karl set
out after him just about the time of his arrival70000 strong
the Prince hears including plenty of Pandours Certain it is the poor
Princes mind did flounder a good deal and his procedures succeeded
extremely ill on this occasion Certain too that they were extremely
illtaken at headquarters and that he even died soon afterchiefly
of broken heart said the censorious world It is well known how Europe
rang with the matter for a long while and Books were printed and
Documents and COLLECTIONS BY A MASTERS HAND _Lettres Secretes
touchant la Deniere Guerre de Main de Maitre divisees en deux parties_
Francfort et Amsterdam 1772 this is the Princes own Statement
Proof in hand By far the clearest Account is in _Schmettaus Leben_ by
his Son pp 353384 See also Preuss ii 5761 and especially ii
407 We who can spend but a page or two on it must carefully stand by
the essential part

JUNE 30thJULY 3d Prince at JungBunzlau in chief command Besides
Winterfeld the Generals under him are Ziethen Schmettau Fouquet
Retzow Goltz and two others who need not be of our acquaintance
Impossible to stay there thinks the Prince thinks everybody and they
shift to Neuschloss westward thirty miles July 1st Daun had crossed
the Elbe Daun let us say for brevity though it is Daun and Karl or
even Karl and Daun Karl being chief and capable of saying so at times
though Daun is very splendent since Kolincrossed the Elbe above
Brandeis Nadasti with precursor Pandours now within an hours march
of JungBunzlauand it was time to go

JULY 3d6th At Neuschloss which is thought a strong position key of
the localities there and nearer Friedrich too the Prince stayed not
quite four days shifted to Bohm BohmISCH Leipa JULY 7thrather off
from Leitmeritz but a march towards Zittau where the provisions are
A bad change said the Princes friends afterwards change advised by
Winterfeldwho never mentioned that circumstance to his Majesty many
as he did mention not in the best wayPrince gets to Bohm Leipa July
7th stays there in questionable circumstances nine days

Bohm Leipa is still not above thirty miles northeastward of the King
and it is about the same distance southwestward from Zittau out of
which fine Town partly by crossroads the Prince gets his provisions
on this march From Zittau hitherward as far as the little Town of
Gabel which lies about half way there is broad High Road the great
Southern KAISERSTRASSE from Gabel for Bohm Leipa you have to cross
southwestward by country roads the keys to which especially Gabel the
Prince has not failed to secure by proper garrison parties And so
for about a week not quite uncomfortably he continues at Bohm Leipa
getting in his convoys from Zittau Diligently scanning the Pandour
stragglings and sputterings round him which are clearly on the
increasing hand Diligently corresponding with the King meanwhile who
much discourages undue apprehension or retreat movement till the last
pinch Edging backward and again backward you come bounce upon Berlin
one day and will then have to haltwhich is not pleasant to the
Prince But indisputably the Pandour spurts on him do become Pandour
gushings with regulars also noticeable it is certain the Austrians
are outpretending first to mean the King and Leitmeritz but knowing
better and meaning the Prince and Bohm Leipa all the whileBy way of
supplement take Dauns positions in the interim

Daun and Karl were at Podschernitz 26th June 1st July cross the Elbe
above Brandeis Nadasti now within an hours march of JungBunzlau 7th
July day while the Prince is flitting to Bohm Leipa Daun is through
JungBunzlau to Munchengratz thence to Liebenau 14th to Niemes
not above four miles from the Princes rightmost outpost rightmost or
eastmost which looks away from his Brother while a couple of advanced
parties Beck and Maguire hover on his flank Zittauward and Nadasti
if he knew it is pushing on to rear

THURSDAY 14th JULY About six in the evening at Bohm Leipa distinct
cannonthunder is heard from northeast Evidently Gabel getting
cannonaded and our wagon convoy empty going to Zittau for meal
General Puttkammer escorting is in a dangerous state And by and by
hussar parties of ours come in with articulate news to that bad
effect Gabel under hot attack of regulars Puttkammer with his 3000
vigorously defending will expect to be relieved within not many hours
Here has the crisis come Crisis sure enoughand the Prince to meet
it summons that refuge of the irresolute a Council of War

Winterfeld who is just come home in these moments did not
attendnot till three next morning Winterfeld had gone to bed
fairly tired dead with long marching and hurrying about To the poor
Prince there are three courses visible Course FIRST That of joining
the King at Leitmeritz Gabel Zittau lost in that case game given
upreception likely to be bad at Leitmeritz Course SECONDthe
course Friedrich himself would at once have gone upon and been already
well ahead withThat of instantly taking measures for the relief
of Puttkammer Dispute Gabel to the last retreat on loss of it
Parthianlike to Zittau by that broad Highway short and broad whole
distance hence only thirty miles Thirty miles say the multitude
of Counsellors Yes but the first fifteen TO Gabel is crossroad
hilly difficult they have us in flank We are 25000 urges the
Prince fifteen miles is not much The thing had its difficulties
the Prince himself it appears faintly thought it feasible 25000
we 20000 they only fifteen miles said he But the variety of
Counsellors Crossroads defiles flankmarch dangerous said they
And so the third course which was incomparably the worst found favor
in Council of War That of leaving Gabel and Puttkammer to their fate
and of pushing off for Zittau leftwards through the safe Hills
by Kamnitz Kreywitz Rumburgwhich if the reader look is by a
circuitous nay quite parabolic course twice or thrice as farIn
that manner let us save Zittau and our Main Body said the Council of
War Yes my friends a cannonball endeavoring to get into Zittau
from the townditch would have to take a parabolic courseand the
cannonball would be speedy upon it and not have Hill roads to go
by This notable parabolic circuit of narrow steep roads may have its
difficulties for an Army and its baggages Enough the poor Prince
adopted that worst third course and even made no despatch in getting
into it and it proved ruinous to Zittau and to much else his own life
partly included

JULY 16th22d Thursday night or Friday 3 AM that third and
incomparably worst course was adopted Gabel Puttkammer with his
wagons ensigns kettledrums all this has to surrender in a day High
Road to Zittau for the Austrians is a smooth march when they like to
gather fully there and start And in the Hills with their jolts and
precipitous windings infested too by Pandours the poor Prussian
Main Body on its wide parabolic circuit has a time of it Loses its
pontoons loses most of its baggage obliged to set fire not to the
Pandours but to your own wagons and necessaries of army life encamps
on bleak heights no food not even water road quite lost road to be
rediscovered or invented Pandours sputtering on you out of every
bush and hollow your peasant wagoners cutting traces and galloping
offsuch are the phenomena of that march by circuit leftward on the
poor Princes part March began soon after midnight SATURDAY 16th
Schmettau as vanguard and

And in fine by FRIDAY 22d after not quite a week of it the Prince
curving from northward in parabolic course LESS speedy than the
cannonballs would have been into sight of Zittaubehold there are
the Austrians far and wide to left of us encamped impregnable behind
the Neisse River there They have got the Eckarts Hill which commands
Zittauand how to get into Zittau and our magazines and how to
subsist if we were in The poor Prince takes post on what Heights there
are on his own side of the Neisse looks wistfully down upon Zittau
asking How

About stroke of noon the Austrians from their Eckartsberg do a thing
which was much talked of They open battery of redhot balls upon
Zittau kindle the roofs of it shingleroofs in dry July set Zittau
all on blaze the 10000 innocent souls shrieking in vain to Heaven and
Earth and before sunset Zittau is ashes and redhot walls not Zittau
but a cinderheapPrussian Garrison not hurt nor Magazine as yet
Garrison busy with buckets I should guess but beginning to find
the air grow very hot On the morrow morning Zittau is a smouldering
cinderheap hotter and hotter to the Prussian Garrison and does not
exist as a City

One of the most inhuman actions ever heard of in War shrieks universal
Germany asks itself what could have set a chivalrous Karl upon this
devillike procedure Protestants these poor Zittauers were shone in
commerce no such weaving industrying in all Teutschland elsewhere
Hah An eyesorrow they with their commerce their weavings and
industryings to Austrian Papists who cannot weave or trade that was
finally the guess of some personswide of the mark we may well judge
Prince Xavier of Saxony present in the Camp too made no remonstrance
said others Alas my friends what could Xavier probably avail
the foolish fellow with only three regiments Prince Karl it was
afterwards evident could have got Zittau unburnt and could even have
kept the Prussians out of Zittau altogether Zittau surely would have
been very useful to Prince Karl But overnight let us try to fancy it
so not knowing the Prussian possibilities Prince Karl screwed to the
devilish point had got his furnaces lighted his redhot balls ready
and so hurried on by his Pride and by his other Devils hadThere are
devilish things sometimes done in War And whole cities are made
ashes by them For certain here is a strange way of commencing your
Deliverance of Saxony And Prince Karl carries truly a brandmark
from this conflagration and will till all memory of him cease As to
Zittau it rebuilt itself Zittau is alive again a strong stone city
in our day On its newbuilt Townhouse stands again BENE FACERE ET
MALE AUDIRE REGIUM EST To do well and be ill spoken of is the part
of kings A saying of Alexander the Greats Plutarch in ALEXANDRE
amazingly true of themwhen they are not shams What times for
Herrnhuth preparing for its Christian Sabbath under these omens near
by

The Prince of Prussia tells us he early next morning Saturday 23d
July had his tents pitched which was but an unavailing procedure
with poor Zittau gone such a road Bring us bread out of that ruined
Zittau ordered the Prince his Detachment returns ineffectual So
hot we cannot march in And the Garrison Colonel one Dierecke and
five battalions are garrison sends out word So hot we cannot stand
it Stand it yet a very little and answers the Prince but
Dierecke and battalions cannot or at least cannot long enough and set
to marching out In firm order I have no doubt and with some modicum
of bread but the tumbling of certain burnt walls parted Colonel and
men in a sad way Colonel himself with the colors with the honors
none of his people it seems though they were scattered loose was
picked up by an Austrian party and made prisoner A miserable business
this of Zittau

Next evening Sunday after dark Prince of Prussia strikes his tents
again rolls off in a very unsuccinct condition happily unchased for
he admits that chase would have been ruinous Off towards Lobau what
nights for Zinzendorf and Herrnhuth as such things tumble past
them thence towards Bautzen and arrives in the most lugubrious torn
condition any Prussian General ever stood in Reaches Bautzen on those
termsand is warned that his Brother will be there in a day or two

One may fancy Friedrichs indignation astonishment and grief when
he heard of that march towards Zittau through the Hills by a parabolic
course the issue of which is too guessable by Friedrich He himself
instantly rises from Leitmeritz starts in fit divisions by the
Pascopol by the Elbe passes for Pirna and leaving Moritz of Dessau
with a 10000 to secure the Passes about Pirna and Keith to come on
with the Magazines hastens across for Bautzen to look into these
advancing triumphant Austrians these strange Prussian proceedings
On first hearing of that sidemarch his auguries had been bad enough
Letter to Wilhelmina Linay 22d July second day of the march from
Leitmeritz _OEuvres_ xxvii i 298 but the event has far surpassed
them Zittau gone the Army hurrying home as if in flight in that
wrecked condition the door of Saxony door of Silesia left wide
openDaun has only to choose Day by day as Friedrich advanced to
repair that mischief the news of it have grown worse on him Days rife
otherwise in mere bad news The Russians in Memel Preussen at their
feet Soubises French and the Reichs Army pushing on for Erfurt to
deliver Saxony on that western side and from the FrenchEnglish
scene of operationsIn those same bad days Royal Highness of Cumberland
has been doing a feat worth notice in the above connection Read this
from an authentic source

HASTENBECK 22d26th JULY 1757 Royal Highness hitching back and
back had got to Hameln a strong place of his on the safe side of the
Weser and did at last Hanover itself being now nigh call halt and
resolve to make a stand July 22d very day while the Prince of Prussia
came in sight of Zittau with the Austrians hanging over it Royal
Highness took post in that favorable vicinity of Hameln at perfect
leisure to select his ground and there sat waiting DEstreesswamps
for our right wing and the Weser not far off small Hamlet of
Hastenbeck in front and a woody knoll for our lefttotally inactive
for four days long attempting nothing upon DEstrees and his intricate
shufflings but looking idly noonward to the courses of the sun till
DEstrees should come up Royal Highness is much swollen into obesity
into flabby torpor a changed man since Fontenoy times shockingly
inactive they say in this post at Hastenbeck DEstrees too is
ridiculously cautious has manoeuvred fifteen days in advancing about
as many British miles DEstrees did at last come up July 25th
nearly two to one of Royal Highness72000 some count him but
considerably anarchic in parts overwhelmed with Court Generals and
Princes of the Blood for one itemand decides on attacking next
morning DEstrees duly went to reconnoitre but unluckily had mist
suddenly falling Well we must attack all the same

And so 26th JULY Tuesday there ensued a BATTLE OF HASTENBECK the
absurdest Battle in the world and which ought in fairness to have
been lost by BOTH though Royal Highness alone had the ill luck Both
Captains behaved very poorly and each of them had a subaltern who
behaved well DEstrees with his 70000 VERSUS 40000 posted there
knows nothing of Royal Highnesss position sees only Royal Highnesss
left wing on that woody Height and after hours of preliminary
cannonading sends out General Chevert upon that Chevert his subaltern
a bit of right soldierstuff the Chevert whom we knew at Prag in old
Belleisle times goes upon it like fury whom the Brunswick Grenadiers
resist in like humor hotter and hotter Some hard fighting there on
Royal Highnesss left Chevert very fiery Grenadiers very obstinate
till on the centre westward in Royal Highnesss chief battery there
some spark went the wrong way and a powderwagon shot itself aloft with
hideous blaze and roar and in the confusion the French rushed in and
the battery was lost Which discouraged the Grenadiers so that Chevert
made some progress upon them on their woody Height and began to have
confident hope

Had Chevert known or had DEstrees known there was close behind said
Height a Hollow through which these Grenadiers might have been taken
in rear Dangerous Hollow much neglected by Royal Highness who has
only General Breitenbach with a weak party there This Breitenbach
happening to have a head of his own and finding nothing to do in that
Hollow or to rightward bursts out of his own accord on Cheverts
left flank cannonading volleying horsechargingthe sound of which
Hah French there too struck a damp through Royal Highness who
instantly ordered retreat and took the road What singular illluck
that sound of Breitenbach to Royal Highness For observe the EFFECT
of Breitenbachwhich was to recover the lost battery gallant
young Prince of Brunswick Hereditary Prince or Duke that is to
be striking in upon it with bayonetcharge at the right moment made
DEstrees to order retreat Battle lost thinks DEstreesand with
good cause had Breitenbach been supported at all But no subaltern
durst and Royal Highness himself was not overtakable so far on the
road Royal Highness wept on hearing the Brunswick Grenadiers too
are said to have wept for rage and probably Breitenbach and the
Hereditary Prince Mauvillon i 228 Anonymous of Hamburg i 206
who gives a Plan and all manner of details if needed by anybody
Kausler c c

This is the last of Royal Highnesss exploits in War The retreat had
been ordered To Hanover but the baggage by mistake took the road for
Minden and Royal Highness followed thithermuch the same what road he
or it takes Friedrich might still hope he would retreat on Magdeburg
40000 good soldiers might find a Captain there and be valuable against
a DEstrees and Soubise in those parts But no it was through Bremen
Country to Stade into the Sea that Royal Highness by ill luck
retreated He has still one great vexation to give Friedrichto us
almost a comfort knowing what followed out of itand will have to be
mentioned one other time in this History and then go over our horizon
altogether

Whether Friedrich had heard of Hastenbeck the day his Brother and he met
July 29th at Bautzen I do not know but it is likely enough he
may have got the news that very morning which was not calculated to
increase ones good humor His meeting with the Prince is royal
not fraternal as all men have heard Let us give with brevity from
Schmettau Junior the exact features of it and leave the candid reader
who has formed to himself some notion of kingship and its sorrows and
stern conditions having perhaps himself some thing of kingly in a
small potential way to interpret the matter and make what he can of
it

BAUTZEN 29th JULY 1757 The King with reinforcement is coming hither
from the Dresden side to take up the reins of this dishevelled Zittau
Army to speed with it against the Austrians and if humanly possible
lock the doors of Silesia and Saxony again and chase the intruders
away Prince of Prussia and the other Generals have notice the night
before At 4 AM tomorrow 29th wait his Majesty Prince and
Generals wait accordingly all there but Goltz and Winterfeld they not
which is noted

For above an hour no King Prince and Generals ride forwardthere is
the King coming Prince Henri Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick and others
in his train King noticing them at about 300 paces distance drew
bridle Prince of Prussia did the like train and he saluting with their
hats as did the Kings train in return King did not saluteon the
contrary he turned his horse round and dismounted as did everybody
else on such signal King lay down on the ground as if waiting the
arrival of his Vanguard and bade Winterfeld and Goltz sit by him Poor
Prince of Prussia and battered heavyladen GeneralsAfter a minute or
two Goltz came over and whispered to the Prince Hither MEINE HERREN
all of you a message from his Majesty cried the Prince Whereupon
to Generals and Prince Goltz delivered in equable official tone these
affecting words His Majesty commands me to inform your Royal Highness
That he has cause to be greatly discontented with you that you deserve
to have a Courtmartial held over you which would sentence you and all
your Generals to death but that his Majesty will not carry the matter
so far being unable to forget that in the Chief General he has a
Brother Schmettau pp 384 385

The Prince answered He wanted only a Courtmartial and the like in
stiff tone Here is the Letter he writes next day to his Brother with
the Answer


PRINCE OF PRUSSIA TO THE KING

BAUTERN 30th July 1757

MY DEAR BROTHERThe Letters you have written me and the reception I
yesterday met with are sufficient proof that in your opinion I have
ruined my honor and reputation This grieves but it does not crush
me as in my own mind I am not conscious of the least reproach I am
perfectly convinced that I did not act by caprice I did not follow the
counsels of people incapable of giving good ones I have done what I
thought to be suitablest for the Army All your Generals will do me that
justice

I reckon it useless to beg of you to have my conduct investigated this
would be a favor you would do me so I cannot expect it My health has
been weakened by these fatigues still more by these chagrins I have
gone to lodge in the Town to recruit myself

I have requested the Duke of Bevern to present the Army Reports he can
give you explanation of everything Be assured my dear Brother that
in spite of the misfortunes which overwhelm me and which I have not
deserved I shall never cease to be attached to the State and as a
faithful member of the same my joy will be perfect when I learn the
happy issue of your Enterprises I have the honor to be

AUGUST WILHELM _Main de Maitre_ p 21


KINGS ANSWER THE SAME DAY

CAMP NEAR BAUTZEN 30th July 1757 MY DEAR BROTHERYour bad
guidance has greatly deranged my affairs It is not the Enemy it
is your illjudged measures that have done me all this mischief
My Generals are inexcusable either for advising you so ill or in
permitting you to follow resolutions so unwise Your ears are accustomed
to listen to the talk of flatterers only Daun has not flattered
youbehold the consequences In this sad situation nothing is left
for me but trying the last extremity I must go and give battle and if
we cannot conquer we must all of us have ourselves killed

I do not complain of your heart but I do of your incapacity of your
want of judgment in not choosing better methods A man who like me
mark the phrase from such a quarter has but a few days to live need
not dissemble I wish you better fortune than mine has been and that
all the miseries and bad adventures you have had may teach you to
treat important things with more of care more of sense and more of
resolution The greater part of the misfortunes which I now see to be
near comes only from you You and your Children will be more overwhelmed
by them than I Be persuaded nevertheless that I have always loved you
and that with these sentiments I shall die FRIEDRICH MAIN DE MAITRE
p 22

As the King went off to the Heights of Weissenberg Zittau way to
encamp there against the Austrians that same evening the Prince
did not answer this Letterexcept by asking verbally through
LieutenantColonel Lentulus a mute Swiss figure much about the King
who often turns up in these Histories for leave to return to Dresden
by the first escortDepends on himselfan escort is going this
night answered Friedrich And the Prince went accordingly and by two
stages got into Dresden with his escort on the morrow And had not yet
conscious of it quitted the Field of War altogether and was soon about
to quit the world and die poor Prince Died within a year 12th June
1758 at Oranienburg beside his Family where he had latterly been
Preuss ii 60 ib 78Winterfeld was already gone six months
before him Goltz went not long after him the other Zittau Generals
all survived this War

The poor Princes fate as natural was much pitied and Friedrich to
this day is growled at for inhuman treatment and so on Into which
question we do not enter except to say that Friedrich too had his
sorrows and that probably his concluding words with these sentiments
I shall die were perfectly true MAIN DE MAITRE went widely abroad
over the world The poor Princes words and procedures were eagerly
caught up by a scrutinizing publicand some of the former were not too
guarded At Dresden he said one morning calling on a General Finck
whom we shall hear of again Four such disagreeing thinskinned
highpacing UNEINIGE PIQUIRTE Generals as Fouquet Schmettau
Winterfeld and Goltz about you what was to be done said the Prince
to Finck Preuss ii 79 n see ib 60 78

His Wife when at last he came to Oranienburg nursed him fondly that
is one comfortable fact Prince Henri to the last had privately a
grudge of peculiar intensity on this score against all the peccant
parties King not excepted As indeed he was apt to have on various
scores the jealous too vehement little man

Friedrichs humor at this time I can guess to have been wellnigh
desperate He talks once of a horse on too much provocation getting
the bit between its teeth regardless thenceforth of chasms and
precipices Letter to Wilhelmina Linay 22d July cited
abovethough he himself never carries it to that length and always
has a watchful eye when at his swiftest From Weissenberg that
night he drives in the Pandours on Zittau and the Eckartsbergbut the
Austrians dont come out And for three weeks in this fierce necessity
of being speedy he cannot get one right stroke at the Austrians who
sit inexpugnable upon their Eckarts Hill bristling with cannon and
can in no way be manoeuvred down or forced or enticed into Battle A
baffling bitterly impatient three weekstwo of them the worst two
he spends at Weissenberg itself chasing Pandours and scuffling on the
surface till Keith and the Magazinetrain come upeven writing Verses
now and then when the hours get unendurable otherwise

The instant Keith and the Magazines are come he starts for Bernstadt
56000 strong after this junctionand a Prussian Officer dating
Bernstadtel Bernstadt on the now Maps 21st August 1757 sends us
this account which also is but of preliminary nature

AUGUST 15th Majesty left Weissenberg and marched hither much to the
enemys astonishment who had lain perfectly quiet for a fortnight
past fancying they were a mastiff on the doorsill of Silesia little
thinking to be trampled on in this unceremonious way General Beck when
our hussars of the vanguard made appearance had to saddle and ride
as for life leaving every rag of baggage and forty of his Pandours
captive Our hussars stuck to him chasing him into Ostritz where they
surprised General Nadasti at dinner and did a still better stroke of
business Nadasti himself could scarcely leap on horseback and get off
left all his field equipage coaches horses kitchenutensils flunkies
seventytwo in numberand what was worst of all a secret box in
which were found certain Dresden Correspondences of a highly treasonous
character which now the writers there may quake to think ofif
Friedrich or we could take much notice of them in this press of
hurries _HeldenGeschichte_ iv 595599

Next day August 16th Friedrich detached five battalions to
GorlitzPrince Karl he calls it DAUN still camping on the
Eckartsbergand himself about 4 PM with the main Army marched up
to those Austrians on their Hill to see if they would fight _OEuvres

themselves round so as to face him face him and even flank him with
cannonbatteries if he came too near Steep ground precipitous front
of rocks in some places A hollow before their front Village of
Wittgenau there and three roads through it ONE of them with width for
wheels Daun sitting inaccessible in short Next day Winterfeld with
a detached Division crossed the Neisse tried Nadasti Attack Nadasti

him In vain that too they let Nadasti take his own luck for four

Chapter VIDEATH OF WINTERFELD

Before going upon this forlorn march of Friedrichs one of the
forlornest a son of Adam ever had we must speak of a thing which befell
to rearward while the march was only half done and which greatly
influenced it and all that followed It was the seventh day of
Friedrichs march not above eighty miles of it yet done when
Winterfeld perished in fight No Winterfeld now to occupy the Austrians
in his absence to stand between Silesia and them or assist him farther
in his lonesome struggle against the world Let us spend a moment on the
exit of that brave man Bernstadt Gorlitz Country September 7th 1757

The Bevern Army 36000 strong is still there in its place in the
Lausitz near Gorlitz Prince Karl lies quiet in his near Zittau ever
since he burnt that Town and stood four days in arms unattackable
by Friedrich with prospect of advantage The Court of Vienna cannot
comprehend this state of inactivity Two to one and a mere Bevern
against you the King far away in Saxony upon his desperate AntiFrench
mission there why not go in upon this Bevern The French whom we are
by every courier passionately importuning to sweep Saxony clear what
will they say of this strange mode of sweeping Silesia clear Maria
Theresa and her KriegsHofrath are much exercised with these thoughts
and with French and other remonstrances that come Maria Theresa and her
KriegsHofrath at length despatch their supreme Kaunitz Graf Kaunitz
in person to stir up Prince Karl and look into the matter with his
own wise eyes and great heart Prince Karl by way of treat to this high
gentleman determines on doing something striking upon Bevern

Bevern lies with his main body about Gorlitz in and to westward of
Gorlitz a pleasant Town on the left bank of the Neisse readers know
there are four Neisses and which of them this is with fine hilly
country all round bulky solitary Heights and Mountains rising out of
fruitful plainstwo Hochkirchs HIGHKIRKS for example are in this
region one of which will become extremely notable next yearBevern
has a strong camp leaning on the due Heights here with Gorlitz in its
lap and beyond Gorlitz on the right bank of the Neisse united to him
by a Bridge he has placed Winterfeld with 10000 who lies with his
back to Gorlitz proper brooks and fencible places flanking him has
a Dorf THORP called Moys in HIS lap and some short furlong beyond
Moys a 2000 of his grenadiers planted on the top of a Hill called the
Moysberg called also the Holzberg WOODHILL and Jakelsberg of which
the reader is to take notice Fine outpost with proper batteries atop
with hussar squadrons and hussar pickets sprinkled about which commands
a far outlook towards Silesia and in marching thither or in continuing
here is useful to have in handwere it not a little too distant from
the main body It is this Jakelsberg capable of being snatched if one
is sudden enough that Prince Karl decides on it may be good for much
or for little to Prince Karl and if even for nothing it will be a
brilliant affront upon Winterfeld and Bevern and more or less charming
to Kaunitz

Winterfeld the ardent enterprising man Kings other self is thought
to be the mainspring of affairs here small thanks to him privately
from Bevern add some and is stationed in the extreme van as we see
Winterfeld is engaged in many things besides the care of this post and
indeed where a critical thing is to be done we can imagine Winterfeld
goes upon it We must try to stay here till the King has finished in
Saxony says Winterfeld always To which Bevern replies Excellent
truly but how Bevern has his provender at Dresden sadly far off
has to hold Bautzen garrisoned and gets much trouble with his convoys
Better in Silesia with our magazines at hand thinks Bevern less
mindful of other considerations

Tuesday September 6th Prince Karl sends Nadasti to the right bank of
the River forward upon Moys to do the Jakelsberg before day tomorrow
only some 2000 grenadiers on it Nadasti has with him 15000 some
count 20000 of all arms artillery in plenty surely sufficient for the
Jakelsberg and Daun advances with the main body on the other side
of the River to be within reach should Moys lead to more serious
consequences Nadasti diligently marches all day posts himself at night
within few miles of Moys gets his cannon to the proper Hills GALLOWS
Hill and others his Croats to the proper Woods and before daylight
on the morrow means to begin upon the Moys Hill and its 2000
grenadiers

Wednesday morning at the set hour Nadasti with artillery bursting
out and quivering battlelines is at work accordingly hurls up 1000
Croats for one item and regulars to the amount of forty companies in
three lines The grenadiers somewhat astonished for the morning
was misty and their hussarposts had come hastily in stood upon their
guard like Prussian men hurled back the 1000 Croats fast enough
stubbornly repulsed the regulars too and tumbled them down hill with
bulletstorm for accompaniment gallantly foiling this first attempt of
Nadastis Of course Nadasti will make another will make ever others
capture of the Jakelsberg can hardly be doubtful to Nadasti

Winterfeld was not at Moys he was at Gorlitz just got in from
escorting an important mealconvoy hither out of Bautzen and was in
conference with Bevern when rumor of these Croat attacks came in at the
gallop from Moys Winterfeld made little of the rumors he had heard
of some attack intended but it was to have been overnight and has
not been Mere foraging of Croat rabble like yesterdays said
Winterfeld and continued his present business In few minutes the sound
of heavy cannonading convinced him Haha there are my guests
said he we must see if we cannot entertain them right sprang to
horseback ordered on doublequick the three regiments nearest him
and was off at the galloptoo late or alas too EARLY we might
rather say Arriving at the gallop Winterfeld found his grenadiers
and their insufficient reinforcements rolling back the Hill lost
Winterfeld sprang to a fresh horse shot his lightning glances and
energies to his hand and that stormfully rallied the matter recovered
the Hill and stormfully defended it for I should guess an hour or
more and might still have done one knows not what had not a bullet
struck him through the breast and suddenly ended all his doings in this
world

Three other reasons the Prussians give for loss of their Hill which are
of no consequence to them or to us in comparison First that Bevern on
message after message sent no reinforcement that Winterfeld was left
to his own 10000 and what he and they could make of it Bevern is
jealous of Winterfeld hint they and willing to see his impetuous
audacity checked Perhaps only cautious of getting into a general
action for what was intrinsically nothing Second that two regiments
of Infantry whom Winterfeld detached doublequick to seize a couple of
villages Leopoldshayn Hermsdorf on his right and therefrom fusillade
Nadasti on flank found the villages already occupied by thousands of
Croats with regular foot and cannonbatteries and could in nowise
seize them This was a great reverse of advantage Third that an
AidedeCamp made a small misnomer misreport of one word which was
terribly important Bring me hither Regiment Manteuffel Winterfeld
had ordered The AidedeCamp reported it Grenadiers Manteuffel upon
which the grenadiers who were posted in a walled garden an important
point to Winterfelds right came instantly to order and Austrians
instantly rushed in to the vacant post and galled Winterfelds other
flank by their fire Abundant Accounts in Seyfarth ii _Beylagen_
162163 _HeldenGeschichte_ iv 615633 Retzow i 216221

Enough Winterfeld lay bleeding to death the Hill was lost Prussians
drawing off slowly and backforemost about two in the afternoon upon
which the Austrians also drew off leaving only a small party on the
Hill who voluntarily quitted it next morning Next morning likewise
Winterfeld had died The Hill was except as bravado and by way
of comfort to Kaunitz nothing for the Austrians but the death of
Winterfeld which had come by chance to them in the business was
probably a great thing Better than two pitched battles gained who
shall say He was a shining figure this Winterfeld dangerous to the
Austrians The most shining figure in the Prussian Army except its
Chief and had great thoughts in his head Prussia is not skilful to
celebrate her Heroesthe Prussian Muse of History choked with dry
military pipeclay or with husky cobwebbery and academic pedantry how
can shebut if Prussia can produce heroes worth celebrating that
is the one important point Apart from soldiership and the outward
features which are widely different there is traceable in Winterfeld
some kinship in soul to English Chatham his contemporary though he has
not had the fame of Chatham

Winterfeld was by no means universally liked as what brave man is or
can be Too susceptible to flattery too this too that He is one
feels always except Friedrich only the most shining figure in the
Prussian Army and it was not unnatural he should be Friedrichs
one friendas seems to have been the case Friedrich when this
Jobsmessage reached him in Erfurt Country eight days hence was
deeply affected by it To tears or beyond tears as we can fancy
Against my multitude of enemies I may contrive resources he was heard
to say but I shall find no Winterfeld again Adieu my one friend
real Peer sole companion to my lonely pilgrimage in these perilous high
regions

The Prince of Prussia contrariwise says a miserable little Note
which must not be withheld brightened up at the news I shall now die
much more content knowing that there is one so bad and dangerous man
fewer in the Army And six months after in his actual deathmoments
he exclaimed I end my life the last period of which has cost me so
much sorrow but Winterfeld is he who shortened my days Preuss ii
75 citing RetzowVery bitter Opposition humors circulating in their
fashion there as elsewhere in this world

Bevern the millstone of Winterfeld being off his neck has become a
more responsible though he feels himself a muchdelivered man Had
not liked Winterfeld they say or had even hated him since those
bad Zittau times Can now at any rate make for Schlesien and the
mealmagazines when he sees good He will find meal readier there may
he find other things corresponding Nobody now to keep him painfully
manoeuvring in these parts with the Kings Army nearer to him but meal
not

On the third day after September 10th Bevern having finished
packing took the road for Schlesien Daun and Karl attending him
nothing left of Daun and Karl in those Saxon Countriesexcept at
Stolpen out Dresdenwards some ReservePost or Rearguard of 15000
should we chance to hear of that again And from the end of September
onwards Beverns star once somewhat bright at Reichenberg shot
rapidly downwards under the horizon altogether and there came post
after post such news out of Schlesiento say nothing of that Stolpen
Partyas Friedrich had never heard before




Chapter VIIFRIEDRICH IN THURINGEN HIS WORLD OF ENEMIES ALL COME

The SoubiseHildburghausen people had got rendezvoused at Erfurt about
August 25th 50000 by account and no enemy within 200 miles of them
and in the Versailles circles it had been expected they would proceed to
the Deliverance of Saxony straightway What is to hinderFriedrich
haggling with the Austrians at Bernstadt could muster but a poor
23000 when he did march towards Erfurt In those same neighborhoods
within reach of Soubise is the Richelieu late DEstrees Army elated
with Hastenbeck comfortably pushing Royal Highness of Cumberland
who makes no resistance step by step into the sea victoriously
plundering far and wide in those countries Hanover itself the
Headquarter In the Versailles circles it is farther expected that
Richelieu Conqueror of Minorca will shortly besiege and conquer
Magdeburg and so crown his glories Why not were the Deliverance of
Saxony complete

The whole of which turned out greatly otherwise and to the sad
disappointment of Versailles The Conqueror of Minorca is probably aware
that the conquering of Magdeburg against one whose platforms are not
rotten and who does not lie always in his bed as poor old Blakeney
did will be a very different matter And the private truth is Marrchal
de Richelieu never turned his thoughts upon Magdeburg at all nor upon
any point of war that had difficulties but solely upon collecting
plunder for himself in those Countries One of the most magnificent
marauders on record in no danger he of becoming monitory and a
pendulum like the 1000 that already swing in that capacity to rear
of him And he did manage in this Campaign which was the last of his
military services so as to pay off at Paris above 50000 pounds of
debts and to build for himself a beautiful Garden Mansion there which
the mocking populations called Hanover Pavilion PAVILION DHANOVRE
a name still sticking to it I believe Barbier iii 256 271 Of the
Richelieu Campaign we are happily delivered from saying almost anything
and the main interest for us turns now on that SoubiseHildburghausen
wing of itwhich also is a sufficiently contemptible affair not to be
spoken of beyond the strictly unavoidable

Friedrich with his 23000 setting out from Dresden August 30th has a
march of about 170 miles towards Erfurt He may expect to findcounting
Richelieu if Royal Highness of Cumberland persist in acting ZERO as
hithertoa confused mass of about 150000 Enemies of one sort and
other waiting him ahead not to think of those he has just left
behindand he cannot well be in a triumphant humor Behind before
around it is one gathering of Enemies one point only certain that
he must beat them or else die Readers would fain follow him in this
forlorn march him the one point of interest now in it and readers
shall if we can manage though it is extremely difficult For on
getting to Erfurt he finds his SoubiseHildburghausen Army off on
retreat among the inaccessible Hills still farther westward and has
to linger painfully there and to detach and even to march personally
against other Enemies and then these finished to march back towards
his Erfurt ones who are taking heart in the interimand in short
from September 1st to November 5th there are two months of confused
manoeuvring and marching to and fro in that WestSaxon region which
are very intricate to readers November 5th is a day unforgettable
but anterior to that what can we do Here dated are the Three
grand Epochs of the thing which readers had better fix in mind as a
preliminary

1 SEPTEMBER 13th Friedrich has got to Erfurt neighborhood but Soubise
and Company are off westward to the Hills of Eisenach wont come down
Friedrich obliged to linger thereabouts painfully waiting almost a
month till

2 OCTOBER 11th hearing that 15000 Austrians that Stolpen Party
left as rearguard at Stolpen Croats mainly under a General Haddick
are on march for Berlin he rises in haste thitherward through Leipzig
Torgau say 100 miles hears that Haddick HAS been in Berlin 16th17th
October for one day and that he is off again full speed with a ransom
of 30000 pounds which they have had to pay him upon which Friedrich
calls halt in the Torgau countryand would have been uncertain what to
do had not

3 Soubise and Company extremely elated with this Haddick Feat come
out from their Hills intent to deliver Saxony after all So that
Friedrich has to turn back October 26th30th through Leipzig again
towardsin fact towards ROSSBACH and NOVEMBER 5th in his old Saale
Country which does not prove so wearisome as formerly

These are the cardinal dates these let the reader recur to if
necessary and keep steadily in mind it will then perhaps be possible
to intercalate in a manner intelligible to him what other lucent
phenomena there are and these dismal wanderings and miserablest two
months of Friedrichs life will not be wholly a provoking blotch
of enigmatic darkness but in some sort a thing with features in the
twilight of the Past




I FRIEDRICHS MARCH TO ERFURT FROM DRESDEN31st August13th
September 1757

The march to Erfurt was of twelve days and without adventure to speak
of Mayer and FreeBattalion had the vanguard Friedrich there as usual
main body under Keith with Ferdinand and Moritz following in several
columns straight towards their goal with steady despatch for twelve
daysweather often very wet Tempelhof i 229 Rodenbeck i 317
not very correct in Westphalen ii 20 c a personal Diary of this
March and of what followed on Duke Ferdinands part Seidlitz with
cavalry had gone ahead in search of one Turpin a mighty hunter and
Hussar among the French who was threatening Leipzig threatening Halle
but Turpin made off at sound of him without trying fight so that
Seidlitz had only to halt and rejoin hoping better luck another time

A march altogether of the common typethe stages of it not worth
marking except for special readersand of memorable to us offers only
this if even this at Rotha in Leipzig Country the eighth stage from
Dresden Friedrich writes willing to try for Peace if it be possible


TO THE MARECHAL DUC DE RICHELIEU

ROTHA 7th September 1757

I feel M le Duc that you have not been put in the post where you are
for the purpose of Negotiating I am persuaded however that the Nephew
of the great Cardinal Richelieu is made for signing treaties no less
than for gaining battles I address myself to you from an effect of the
esteem with which you inspire even those who do not intimately know you

T is a small matter Monsieur IL SAGIT DUNE BAGATELLE only to
make Peace if people are pleased to wish it I know not what your
Instructions are but in the supposition that the King your Master zow
assured by your Successes will have put it in your power to labor in
the pacification of Germany I address to you the Sieur dElcheset
Sieur Balbi is the real name of him an Italian Engineer of mine
who once served with you in the Fontenoy timesand some say he has
privately a 15000 pounds for your Graces acceptancethe Sieur
dElcheset in whom you may place complete confidence

Though the events of this Year afford no hope that your Court still
entertains a favorable disposition for my interests I cannot persuade
myself that a union which has lasted between us for sixteen years may
not have left some trace in the mind Perhaps I judge others by myself
But however that may be I in short prefer putting my interests into
the King your Masters hands rather than into any others If you have
not Monsieur any Instructions as to the Proposal hereby made I beg of
you to ask such and to inform me what the tenor of them is

He who has merited statues at Genoa ten years ago in those
ANTIAustrian times when Genoa burst up in revolt and the French
and Richelieu beautifully intervened against the oppressors he who
conquered Minorca in spite of immense obstacles he who is on the point
of subjugating Lower Saxonycan do nothing more glorious than to
restore Peace to Europe Of all your laurels that will be the fairest
Work in this Cause with the activity which has secured you such rapid
progress otherwise and be persuaded that nobody will feel more grateful
to you than Monsieur le DucYour faithful Friend FREDERIC Given
in RODENBECK i 313 doubtless from _Memoires de Richelieu_ Paris
1793 ix 175 the one fountainhead in regard to this small affair
for the 15000 pounds and other rumored particulars sea Retzow i
197 Preuss ii 84 _ OEuvres de Frederic_ iv 145

Richelieu it appears by any evidence there is went willingly into
this scheme and applied at Versailles as desired with a peremptory
negative for result Nothing came of the Richelieu attempt there nor of
CE M DE MIRABEAU if he ever went nor of any other on that errand
Needless to apply for Peace at Versailles and a mere waste of your sum
of 15000 pounds which one hopes is fabulous in the present scarcity
of moneyor should we perhaps have mentioned the thing at all except
for the sake of Wilhelmina whose fond scheme it is in this extremity of
fate scheme which she tries in still other directions as we shall see
her Brother willing too but probably with much less hope If a civil
Letter and a bribe of Money will do it these need not be spared

This at Rotha is the day while Winterfeld on Moys Hill is meeting his
death Today at Pegau in this neighborhood Seidlitz who could not
fall in with Turpin has given the Hussars of Loudon a beautiful slap
the first enemy we have seen on this march and the lastnothing
but Loudon and Hussars visibly about the rest of those SoubiseReichs
people dormant as would seem DElcheset Balbi or whoever he
was would not find Richelieu at Hanover but at a place called
KlosterZeven in Bremen Country fifty or sixty miles farther on
There this day are Richelieu with one Sporcken a Hanoverian and
one Lynar a Dane rapidly finishing a thing they were pleased to call
Convention of KlosterZeven which Friedrich regarded as another huge
misfortune fallen on himthough it proved to have been far the reverse
a while after Concerning which take this brief Note cannot be too
brief on such a topic

Never was there a more futile Convention than that of KlosterZeven
which filled all Europe with lamentable noises indignations and
anxieties during the remainder of that Year and is now reduced for
Europe and the Universe to a silent mathematical point or mere mark
of position requiring still to be attended to in that character
though itself zero in any other Here are the main particulars in their
sequence

August 3d towards midnight 11 PM say the Books Marechal de
Richelieu arrives in the DEstrees Camp Camp of Oldendorf still only
one march west of Hastenbeck to whom DEstrees on the instant loftily
delivers up his Army explains with loyalty for a few days more all
things needful to the new Commander declines to be himself Second and
loftily withdraws to the Baths of Aachen for his health

Royal Highness of Cumberland is by this time well on Elbeward
Oceanward Till August 1st for one week Royal Highness of Cumberland
lay at Minden some thirty odd miles from Hastenbeck deploring that
sad mistake but unpersuadable to stand and try amendment of it August
1st the French advancing on him again he moved off northward seaward
By Nienburg Verden Rothenburg Zeven Bremenvorde Stadearrived at
Stade on the tidal Waters of the Elbe August 5th and by necessity did
halt there From Minden onwards Richelieu not DEstrees has had the
chasing of Royal Highness one of the simplest functions only that
the country is getting muddy difficult for artillerycarriage thinks
Richelieu with an Army so dilapidated hungry short of pay and that
Royal Highness a very furious person to our former knowledge might
turn on us like a boar at bay endangering everything and finally that
ones desire is not for battle but for a fair chance of plunder to pay
ones debts

Britannic Majesty in this awful state of his Hanover Armaments
has been applying at the Danish Court Richelieu too sends off an
application thither Mediate between us spare useless bloodshed
Valfons p 291Whereupon Danish Majesty Britannics soninlaw
cheerfully undertakes it bids one Lynar bestir himself upon it Count
Lynar an esteemed Official of his who lives in those neighborhoods
Danish Viceroy in Oldenburgmuch concerned with the Scriptures the
Sacred Languages and other seraphic studiesand a changed man since we
saw him last in the Petersburg regions making love to Mrs Anton Ulrich
long ago Lynar feeling the axis of the world laid on his shoulder in
this manner loses not a moment invokes the Heavenly Powers goes on
it with an alacrity and a despatch beyond praise Runs to the Duke of
Cumberland at Stade thence to Richelieu at Zeven back to the Duke
back to Zeven Wont you and wont YOU and in four short days
has the once worldfamed Convention of KlosterZeven standing on
parchmentsigned ready for ratifying Royal Highnesss Army to go
home to their countries again routes methods times when how and
what next all left unsettled and noise of War to cease in those
parts Signed cheerfully on both sides 9th September 1757 and Lynar
striking the stars with his sublime head Busching who alone is exact
in the matter _ Beitrage_ iv 167 168 Lynar see Scholl iii 49
Valfons pp 202 203 _OEuvres de Frederic_ iv 143 with correction
of Preusss Note there

Unaccountable how Lynar had managed such a difficulty He says
seraphically in a Letter to a friend which the Prussian hussars got
hold of The idea of it was inspired by the Holy Ghost at which the
whole world hahad again For it was a Convention vague absurd not
capable of being executed ratification of it refused by both Courts by
the French Court first if that was any matterand the only thing now
memorable of it is that IT was a total Futility but that there ensued
from it a Fact still of importance namely

That on the 5th of October following Royal Highness quitted Stade
and his wrecked Army hanging sorrowful there like a flight of plucked
cranes in midairarrived at Kensington October 12th heard the
paternal Majesty say that evening Here is my son who has ruined
me and disgraced himselfand thereupon indignantly laid down his
military offices all and sundry and ceased altogether to command
Armies English or other in this world In WALPOLE iii 5964 the
amplest minuteness of detail Whereby in the then and now diagram of
things KlosterZeven as a mathematical point continues memorable in
History though shrunk otherwise to zero

Pitts magnanimity to Royal Highness was conspicuous Royal Highness
it is said had been very badly used in this matter by his poor peddling
Father and the Hanover Ministers the matter being one puddle of
imbecilities from beginning to end He was the soul of honor brave as
a Welf lion but of dim poor head and had not the faintest vestige
ALLERGERINGSTE says Mauvillon of military skill awful in the extreme
to see in command of British Armies Adieu to him forever and a day

Ever since July 29th three days after Hastenbeck Pitt had been in
Office again such the bombardment by CorporationBoxes and Events
impinging on Britannic Majesty but not till now as I fancy had Pitts
way in regard to those German matters been clear to him The question
of a German Army if you must have a NoGeneral at the top of it might
well be problematical to Pitt To equip your strong fighting man
and send him on your errand regardless of expense and by way of
preliminary cut the head off him before saying Goodspeed to you
strong man But with a General Pitt sees that it can be different
that perhaps America can be conquered in Germany and that with a
Britannic Majesty so disposed there is no other way of trying it To
this course Pitt stands henceforth heedless of the gazetteer cackle
Hah our Pitt too become German after all his talkinglike a
seventyfour under full sail with sea wind pilot all of one mind and
only certain waterfowl objecting And is King of England for the next
Four Years the one King poor England has had this long whilehis hand
felt shortly at the ends of the Earth And proves such a blessing to
Friedrich among others as nothing else in this War pretty much his
one blessing little as he expected it Before long Excellency Mitchell
begins consulting about a Generaland Friedrich dimly sees better
things in the distance and that KlosterZeven had not been the
misfortune he imagined but only The darkest hour which it is said
lies nearest to the dawn




II THE SOUBISE HILDBURGHAUSEN PEOPLE TAKE INTO THE HILLS FRIEDRICH
IN ERFURT NEIGHBORHOOD HANGING ON WEEK AFTER WEEK IN AN AGONY OF
INACTION 13th September10th October

Friedrichs march has gone by Dobeln Grimma to Pegau and Rotha
Leipzig way but with Leipzig well to right it just brushes
Weissenfels to rightward next day after Rotha crosses Saale River near
Naumburg whence straight through Weimar Country Weimar City on your
left to Erfurt on the northern sideand

ERFURT TUESDAY 13th SEPTEMBER 1757 About 10 in the morning listen
to a faithful Witness there appeared Hussars on the heights to
northwardVanguard of his Prussian Majesty said Erfurt with alarm
and our French guests with alarm And scarcely were the words uttered
when said Vanguard and gradually the whole Prussian Army only some
9000 though we all thought it the whole came to sight posting
itself in halfmoon shape round us there French and Reichs folk
hurrying off what they could from the Cyriaksberg and Petersberg by the
opposite gatestowards Gotha and the Hills of Eisenach

Think what a dilemma for Erfurt jammed between two horns in this
way should one horn enter before the other got out Much parleying and
supplicating on the part of Erfurt Till at last about 4 PM French
being all off Erfurt flung its gates open and the new Power did enter
with some due state Prussian Majesty in Person who could have hoped
it and Prince Henri beside him Cavalry with drawn swords Infantry
with fieldpieces and the band playingPrussian grenadier march I
should hope or something equally cheering The rest of the Vanguard
and in succession the Army altogether had taken Camp outside looking
down on the Northern Gate over at Ilgertshofen a village in the
neighborhood about two miles off _HeldenGeschichte_ iv 636 637

That is the first sight Friedrich has of LA DAUPHINE as the
Versailles people call this Bellona come to deliver Saxony and she
is considerably coyer than had been expected Many sad days and ardent
vain vows of Friedrich before he could see the skirt of her again From
Ilgertshofen northwestward to Dittelstadt Gamstadt and other poor
specks of villages in Gotha Territory is ten or fifteen miles from
Dittelstadt eastward to Buttstadt and Buttelstadt in Weimar Country
may be twentyfive in this area Friedrich shifting about chiefly
for convenience of quartersheadquarter Kirschleben for a while
Buttelstadt finally and longesthad to wander impatiently to and
fro for four weeks and more no work procurable or none worth
mentioningin the humor of a man whose House is on fire flaming
out of every window front and rear who has run up with quenching
apparatus and cannot being spellbound get the least bucket of
it applied And is by nature the rapidest soul now alive Figure his
situation there as it gradually becomes manifest to him

For the present DAUPHINESS Bellona hurrying to the Hills has left
some tagrag of remnant in Gotha Whereupon the second day here is an
Own Correspondent againnot coming by electric telegraph but what
is a sensible advantage credible in every point when he does come

GOTHA THURSDAY 15th SEPTEMBER GrandDuke and Duchess like everybody
else have been much occupied all morning with the fact that the
Prussian Army Seidlitz and a regiment or two nothing more is
actually here took possession of the TownGates and Main Guard this
morningcertain HungarianFrench hussar rabble hateful to every one
in Gotha having made off in time rapidly towards Eisenach and the
Hills

Towards noon his Royal Majesty in highest person with his Lord
Brother the Prince Henris Royal Highness arrived in Gotha sent
straightway by one of his Officers a compliment to the GrandDuke
and would have the pleasure to come and dine if his Serene Highness
permitted Serene Highness self and Household always cordially
Friedrichs was just about sitting down to dinner and answered with
exuberantly glad surpriseor was answering when Royal Majesty himself
stept in with smiling face and embracing the Duke said I timed
myself to arrive at this moment thinking your Durchlaucht would be
at dinner that I might be received without ceremony and dine like a
neighbor among you Unexpected as this visit was the joy of Duke
and Duchess always fast friends to Friedrich and the latter ever
afterwards his correspondent may be conceived but not adequately
expressed as both the Serenities were touched in the most affecting
manner by the honor of so great a Kings sudden presence among them

His Majesty requested that the Frau von Buchwald our Most Gracious
Duchesss HofDame whose qualities he much valued might dine with
thembeing always fond of sensible people especially sensible women
The whole Highest and High company Royal that is and Ducal was
during table uncommonly merry The King showed himself altogether
content and his bright clever talk and sprightly sallies awakening
everybody to the like left not the least trace visible of the weighty
toils he was then engaged inas if the weightier these were the less
should they fetter the noble openness FREYMUTHIGKEIT of this high
soul which is not to be cast down by the heaviest burden

His Majesty having taken leave of Duke and Duchess and graciously
permitted the chiefest persons of the Gotha Court to pay their respects
withdrew to his Army Letter in _HeldenGeschichte_ iv 638 639
Slept I find elsewhere at Gamstadt on the floor of a little Inn
meaning to examine Posts in that part next morning

Here has been a cheerful little scene for Friedrich the last he has
in these black weeks A laborious Predecessor striving to elucidate
leaves me this Note

What a pity one knows nothing nor can know about this Duke and
Duchess though their names especially the latters name are much
tossed to and fro in the Books We heard of them favorably in
Voltaires time and may again at least of the Lady who is henceforth
a Correspondent of Friedrichs The above is a dim direct view of them
probably our last as well as first Dukes name is Friedrich III I do
believe a man of solidity honor and polite dignified sense a highly
respectable Duke of SachsenGotha contented to be obscure and quietly
do what was still doable in that enigmatic situation He is Uncle to
our George IIIhis Sister is the now PrincessDowager of Wales with
a Lord Bute and I know not what questionable figures and intrigues or
suspicions of intrigue much about her His Duchess Louisa Dorothee
is a Princess of distinguished qualities literary tastesVoltaires
Hostess Friedrichs Correspondent a bright and quietly shining
illumination to the circle she inhabits Duke is now fiftyeight
Duchess fortyseven and they lost their eldest Son last year There has
been lately a considerable private brabble as to Tutorage of the Duke
of Weimar Wilhelminas maddish Duke who is dead lately and a Prince
left who soon died also but left a Son who grew to be Goethes
friend Tutorage claimed by various Cousins has been adjudged to this
one King Friedrich cooperating in such result

As to the famed GrandDuchess she is a SachsenMeiningen Princess
come of Ernst the Pious of Johann the Magnanimous as her Husband
and all these Sachsens are when Voltaire went precipitant with such
velocity from the Potsdam Heaven she received him at Gotha set him on
writing his HISTORY OF THE EMPIRE and endeavored to break his fall She
was noble to Voltaire and well honored by that uncertain Spirit There
is a fine Library at Gotha and the Lady bright loves Books and those
that can write thema friend of the Light a Daughter of the Sun and
the Empyrean not of Darkness and the Stygian Fens Michaelis i 517
c c

Friedrichs first Letter to her Highness was one of thanks above a year
ago for an act of kindness act of justice withal which she did to
one of his Official people Here on the morrow of that dinner is the
second Letter much more aerial and cordial in which style they all
continue now that he has seen the admired Princess


TO THE MOST SERENE GRANDDUCHESS OF SACHSENGOTHA

DITTELSTADT 16th September 1757

MADAMYesterday was a Day I shall never forget which satisfied a
just desire I have had this long while to see and hear a Princess whom
all Europe admires I am not surprised Madam that you subdue peoples
hearts you are made to attract the esteem and the homage of all who
have the happiness to know you But it is incomprehensible to me how you
can have enemies and how men representing Countries that by no means
wish to pass for barbarous can have been so basely INDIGNEMENT
wanting in the respect they owe you and in the consideration which is
due to all sovereigns French not famous for their refined demeanor in
Saxony this time Why could not I fly to prevent such disorders such
indecency I can only offer you a great deal of goodwill but I feel
well that in present circumstances the thing wanted is effective
results and reality May I Madam be so happy as to render you some
service May your fortune be equal to your virtues I am with the
highest consideration Madam your Highnesss faithful CousinF
_OEuvres de Frederic_ xvii 166

To Wilhelmina he says of it next day still gratified though sad news
have come in the interimdeath of Winterfeld for one black item

 The day before yesterday I was in Gotha It was a touching scene
to see the partners of ones misfortunes with like griefs and like
complaints The Duchess is a woman of real merit whose firmness puts
many a man to shame Madam de Buchwald appears to me a very estimable
person and one who would suit you much intelligent accomplished
without pretensions and goodhumored My Brother Henri is gone to see
them today I am so oppressed with grief that I would rather keep my
sadness to myself I have reason to congratulate myself much on account
of my Brother Henri he has behaved like an angel as a soldier and
well towards me as a Brother I cannot unfortunately say the same
of the elder He sulks at me IL ME BODE and has sulkily retired to
Torgau from whence I hear he is gone to Wittenberg I shall leave him
to his caprices and to his bad conduct and I prophesy nothing good for
the future unless the younger guide him Kirschleben near Erfurt
17th September 1757 _OEuvres de Frederic_ xxvii i 306

This is part of a long sad Letter to Wilhelmina parts of which we may
recur to as otherwise illustrative But before going into that tragic
budget of bad news let us give the finale of Gotha which occurred the
next daytragicomic in partand is the last bit of action in those
dreary four weeks

GOTHA 18th SEPTEMBER Since Thursday 15th MajorGeneral Seidlitz
youngest MajorGeneral of the Army but a rapidly rising man has
been Commandant in Gotha under flourishing circumstances popular and
supreme though only with a force of 1500 dragoons and hussars
Monday morning early Seidlitzs scouts bring word that the
SoubiseHildburghausen people are in motion hitherward French
hussars and Austrian Turpins Loudons all that are grenadiers
in masstotal say 8000 horse and foot with abundance of
artilleryhave been on march all night to retake Gotha with all the
Chief Generals and Dignitaries of the Army following in their carriages
for some hours past to see it done Seidlitz ascertaining these
things has but one course leftthat of clearing himself out which
he does with orderly velocity and at 9 AM the Dignitaries and their
8000 find open gates Seidlitz clean off occupy the posts with due
emphasis and flourish and proceed to the Schloss in a grand triumphant
waywhere privately they are not very welcome though one puts
the best face on it and a dinner of importance is the first thing
imperative to be set in progress A flurried Court that of Gotha
and much swashing of French plumes through it all this morning since
Seidlitz had to flit

Seidlitz has not flitted very far Seidlitz has ranked his small
dragoonhussar force in a hollow two miles off has got warning sent to
a third regiment within reach of him Come towards me and in a certain
defile visible from Gotha eastward spread yourselves so and soand
judges by the swashing he hears of up yonder that perhaps something may
still be done Dinner up in the Schloss is just being taken from the
spit and the swashing at its height whenHah what is that though
and all plumes pause For it is Seidlitz artistically spread into
single files on the prominent points of vision advancing again more
like 15000 than 1500 And in the Defile yonder that regiment do you
mark it the Kings vanguard I should sayTo horse

That is Seidlitzs fine Bit of Painting hung out yonder hooked on
the sky itself as temporary background to Gotha to be judged of by the
connoisseurs For pictorial effect breadth of touch truth to Nature
and real power on the connoisseur I have heard of nothing equal by any
artist The high Generalcy Soubise Hildburghausen Darmstadt mount in
the highest haste everybody mounts happy he who has anything to mount
the grenadiers tumble out of the Schloss dragoons artillery tumble
out Dauphiness takes wholly to her heels at an extraordinary pace so
that Seidlitzs hussars could hardly get a stroke at her caught sixty
and odd nine of them Officers not of mark did kill thirty and had
such a haul of equipages and valuable effects cosmetic a good few of
them habilatory artistic as caused the hussar heart to sing for joy
Among other plunder was Loudons Commission of MajorGeneral just on
its road from Vienna poor Mannsteins death the suggesting cause
say someundoubtedly a shining Loudon to whom Friedrich next day
forwarded the Document with a polite Note _HeldenGeschichte_ iv
640 Westphalen ii 37 _OEuvres de Frederic_ iv 147

The day after this bright feat of Seidlitzs which was a slight
consolation to Friedrich there came a Letter from the Duchess not of
compliment only the Letter itself had to be burnt on the spot being
as would seem dangerous for the High Lady who was much a friend of
Friedrichs Their Correspondence very polite and graceful but for
most part gone to the unintelligible state and become vacant and
spectral figures considerably in the Books and was no doubt a
considerable fact to Friedrich His Answer on this occasion may be
given since we have itlest there should not elsewhere be opportunity
for a second specimen

FRIEDRICH TO THE GRANDDUCHESS OF SACHSENGOTHA

KIRSCHLEBEN NEAB ERFURT 20th September 1757

MADAMNothing could happen more glorious to my troops than that of
fighting Madam under your eyes and for your defence I wish their help
could be useful to you but I foresee the reverse If I were obstinately
to insist on maintaining the post of Gotha with Infantry I should ruin
your City for you Madam by attracting thither and fixing there the
theatre of the War whereas by the present course you will only have
to suffer little rubs PASSADES which will not last long

A thousand thanks that you could in a day like yesterday find the
moment to think of your Friends and to employ yourself for them
Seidlitzs attack was brisk quite sudden with an effect like
Harlequins sword in Pantomimes and Gotha in every corner especially
in the Schloss below and above stairsdinner cooked for A and eaten
by B in that mannermust have been the most agitated of little
Cities I will neglect nothing of what you have the goodness to tell
me I shall profit by these notices Heaven grant it might be for the
deliverance and the security of Germany

The most signal mark of obedience I can give you consists
unquestionably in doing your bidding with this Letter Burn it so soon
as read I should have kept it as a monument of your generosity and
courage but Madam since you dispose of it otherwise your orders
shall be executed persuaded that if one cannot serve ones friends one
must at least avoid hurting them that one may be less circumspect for
ones own interest but that one must be prudent and even timid
for theirs I am with the highest esteem and the most perfect
consideration Madam your Highnesss most faithful and affectionate
CousinF _OEuvres de Frederic_ xvii 167

From Erfurt on the night of his arrival finding the Dauphiness in such
humor Friedrich had ordered Ferdinand of Brunswick with his Division
and Prince Moritz with his both of whom were still at Naumburg to go
on different errandsFerdinand out HalberstadtMagdeburg way whither
Richelieu vulturelike if not eaglelike is on wing Moritz to
Torgau to secure our magazine and be on the outlook there Both of them
marched on the morrow November 14th and are sending him newsseldom
comfortable news mainly that in spite of all one can do and it is
not little on Ferdinands part the Richelieu vultures 80000 of them
floating onward leagues broad are not to be kept out of Halberstadt
well if out of Magdeburg itselfand that in short the general
conflagration in those parts too is progressive In Orlichs _First
Moritz_ pp 7189 and in _Westphalen_ ii 23143 about Ferdinand
interesting Documentary details Autographs of Friedrich c in regard
to both these Expeditions Moritz peaceable for some weeks in Torgau
Country was to have an eye on Brandenburg withal on Berlin itself and
before long Moritz will see something noticeable there

From Preussen Friedrich hears of mere ravagings and horrid cruelties
CossackCalmuck atrocities which make human nature shudder In
_HeldenGeschichte_ iv 427437 the hideous details Fight
those monsters go into them at all hazards he writes to Lehwald
peremptorily Lehwald 25000 against 80000 does so draws up in
front of Wehlau not far east of Konigsberg among woody swamps AUGUST
30th at a Hamlet called GROSSJAGERSDORF with his best skill fights
well though not without mistakes and is beaten by cannon and numbers
Tempelhof i 299 Retzow i 212 c c Russians lost about
9000 by their own tale 5000 the Prussians 3000 and the Field
Preussen now lies at Apraxins discretion This bit of news too is on
the road for Erfurt Country Such a six weeks for the swift man obliged
to stand spellboundidle posterity never will conceive it and
description is useless

Let us add here that Apraxin did not advance on Konigsberg or farther
into Preussen at all but after some loitering turned to everybodys
surprise and wended slowly home Could get no provision said Apraxin
for himself Thought the Czarina was dying said the world and
that Peter her successor would take it well Plodded slowly home for
certain Lehwald following him not too close till over the border
Nothing left of Apraxin and his huge Expedition but Memel alone
Memel and a great many graves and ruins So that Lehwald could be
recalled to attend on the Swedes before Winter came And Friedrichs
worst forebodings did not take effect in this casenor in some others
as we shall see




LAMENTATIONPSALMS OF FRIEDRICH

Meanwhile is it not remarkable that Friedrich wrote more Verses this
Autumn than almost in any other three months of his life Singular
yes though perhaps not inexplicable And if readers could fairly
understand that fact instead of running away with the shell of it and
leaving the essence it would throw a great light on Friedrich He
is not a brooding inarticulate man then but a brightglancing
articulate not to be struck dumb by the face of Death itself Flashes
cleareyed into the physiognomy of Death and Ruin and the Abysmal
Horrors opening and has a sharp word to say to them The explanation of
his large cargo of Verses this Autumn is That always alternating with
such fiery velocity he had intolerable periods of waiting till
things were ready And took to verses by way of expectorating
himself and keeping down his devils Not a bad plan in the
circumstancesespecially if you have so wonderful a turn for
expectoration by speech All bad as Poetry those Verses asks the
reader Well some of them are not of firstrate goodness Should have
been burnt or the time marked which they took up and whether it was
good time wasted which I suppose it almost never was or bad time
skilfully got over Time that is the great point and the hearttruth
of them or mere liptruth another We must give some specimens at any
rate

Especially that notable Specimen from the Zittau Countries the Epistle
to Wilhelmina EPITRE A MA SOEUR _OEuvres de Frederic_ xii 3642
which is the keynote as it were the fountainhead of much other
verse and of much prose withal and Correspondencing not with
Wilhelmina alone of which also some taste must be given Primary
EPITRE written I perceive in that interval of waiting for Keith
and the magazinesthough the final date is Bernstadt August 24th
Concerning which Smelfungus takes overhastily the liberty to say
Strange is it not to be on the point of fighting for ones existence
overwhelmed with so many businesses and disposed to go into verse in
addition CONCEIVE that form of mind it would illuminate something of
Friedrichs character I cannot yet rightly understand such an aspect of
structure and know not what to say of it except Strange

Understand it or not we do gather by means of it some indisputable
glimpses nearly all the direct insight allowed us out of any source
into Friedrichs inner man what his thoughts were what his humor was
in that unique crisis and to readers in quest of that these Pieces
fallen obsolete and frosty to all other kinds of readers are well worth
perusing and again perusing Most veracious Documents we can observe
nothing could be truer Confessions they are in the most emphatic
sense no truer ever made to a Priest in the name of the Most High
Like a soliloquy of NightThoughts accidentally becoming audible to us
Mahomet I find wrote the Koran in this manner From these poor
Poems which are voices DE PROFUNDIS there might by proper care and
selection be constructed a Friedrichs Koran and with commentary and
elucidation it would be pleasant to read The Koran of Friedrich or
the LamentationPsalms of Friedrich But it would need an Editorother
than Dryasdust Mahomets Koran treated by the Arab Dryasdust merely
turning up the bottom of that Box of Shoulderblades and printing
them has become dreadfully tough reading on this side of the
Globe and has given rise to the impossiblest notions about Mahomet
Indisputable it is Heroes in their affliction Mahomet and David have
solaced themselves by snatches of Psalms by Suras bursts of Utterance
rising into Songand if Friedrich on far other conditions did the
like what has History to say of blame to him

Wilhelmina comes out very strong in this season of trouble almost the
last we see of our excellent Wilhelmina Like a lioness like a shrill
mother when her children are in peril A noble sisterly affection is
in Wilhelmina shrill Pythian vehemence trying the impossible That a
Brother and such a Brother the most heroic now breathing brave and
true and the soul of honor in all things should have the whole world
rise round him like a delirious SorcerersSabbath intent to hurl the
mountains on himseems such a horror and a madness to Wilhelmina Like
the broodhen flying in the face of wild dogs and packs of hounds in
full trail Most Christian Pompadour Kings enraged Czarinas implacable
EmpressQueens a whole world in armed delirium rushes on regardless of
Wilhelmina Never mind my noble one your Brother will perhaps manage
to come up with this leviathan or that among the heap of them at a good
time and smite into the fifth rib of him Your Brother does not the
least shape towards giving in thank the Heavens he will stand to
himself at least his own poor strength will all be on his own side

Wilhelminas hopes of a Peace with France mission of her Mirabeau
missions and schemes not a few we have heard of on Wilhelminas part
with this view but the notablest is still to mention that of stirring
up by Voltaires means an importantlooking Cardinal de Tencin to
labor in the business Eminency Tencin lives in Lyon known to the
Princess on her Italian Tourshy of asking Voltaire to dinner on
that fine occasionbut except Officially is not otherwise than
wellaffected to Voltaire Was once Chief Minister of France and
would fain again be does not like these Bernis novelties and Austrian
Alliances had he now any power to overset them Let him correspond
with Most Christian Majesty at least plead for a Peace with Prussia
Prussia being so ready that way Eminency Tencin on Voltaires
suggestion did so perhaps is even now doing so till ordered to hold
HIS peace on such subjects This is certain and well known but nothing
else is known or to us knowable about it Voltaire in vague form
being our one authority through whom it is vain to hunt and again
hunt _OEuvres Memoires_ ii 92 93 IB i 143 Preuss ii 84
The Dates much more the features and circumstances all lie buried
from us andtill perhaps the LamentationPsalms are well editedmust
continue lying As a fact certain but undeniably vague

Voltaires procedure one can gather is polite but twofaced not
sublime on this occasion In fact is intended to serve himself To the
high Princess he writes devotionally ready to obey in all things and
then to his Eminency Cardinal Tencin it rather seems as if the tone
were Pooh yes your Eminency such are the poor Ladys notions But
does your Eminency take notice how high my connections are what service
a poor obscure creature might perhaps do the State some day Friedrich
himself is in these ways brought into correspondence with Voltaire
again and occasionally writes to him in this War and ever afterwards
Voltaire responds with fine sympathy always prettily in the enthusiasm
of the momentand at other times he writes a good deal about
Friedrich oftenest in rather a mischievous dialect The traitor
exclaim some Prussian writers not many or important in our time In
fact there is a considerable touch of grinning malice as of Monkey
VERSUS Cat who had once burnt HIS paw instead of getting his own
burnt in those utterances of Voltaire some of which the reader will
grin over too without much tragic feelingthe rather as they did
our Felis Leo no manner of ill and show our incomparable SINGE with a
sparkle of the TIGRE in him theoretic sparkle merely and for moments
which makes him all the more entertaining and interesting at the
domestic hearth

Of Friedrichs LamentationPsalms we propose to give the First and the
Last these with certain Prose Pieces intermediate and connecting may
perhaps be made intelligible to readers and throw some light on these
tragic weeks of the Kings History

1 EPITRE A MA SOEUR First of the LamentationPsalmsThis is
the famed Epistle to Wilhelmina already spoken of which the King
despatched from Bernstadt August 24th just while quitting those
parts on the Erfurt Errandthough written before in the tedium of
waiting for Keith The Piece is long vehement altogether sincere
lyrically sings aloud or declaims in rhyme what ones indignant
thought really is on the surrounding woes and atrocities We faithfully
abridge and condense into our briefest Prosereaders can add water
and the jingle of French rhymes AD LIBITUM It starts thus

O sweet and dear hope of my remaining days O Sister whose friendship
so fertile in resources shares all my sorrows and with a helpful
arm assists me in the gulf It is in vain that the Destinies have
overwhelmed me with disasters if the crowd of Kings have sworn my ruin
if the Earth have opened to swallow meyou still love me noble
and affectionate Sister loved by you what is there of misfortune
Branches off into some survey of it nevertheless

Huge continents of thundercloud plots thickening against me in those
Menzel Documents I watched with terror the sky getting blacker no
covert for me visible on a sudden from the deeps of Hell starts forth
Discord with capital letter and the tempest broke

 Ce fut dans ton Senat O fouqueuse Angleterre
 Ou ce monstre inhumain fit eclater la guerre

It was from thy Senate stormful England that she first launched out
War In remote climates first in America far awaybetween France and
thee Old Ocean shook with it Neptune in the depths of his caves SES
GROTTES PROFONDES saw the English subjecting his waves SES ONDES
the wild Iroquois prize of these crimes FORFAITS bursts out
detesting the tyrants who disturb his Forestsand scalping Braddocks
people and the like

Discord charmed to see such an America and feeble mortals crossing
the Ocean to exterminate one another addresses the European Kings How
long will you be slaves to what are called laws Is it for you to bend
under wornout notions of justice right Mars is the one God Might is
Right A Kings business is to do something famous in this world

O daughter of the Caesars Maria Theresa how at these words
ambition burning in thy soul breaks out uncontrollable Probity
honor treaties duty feeble considerations these to a heart letting
loose its flamy passions determining to rob the generous Germans of
their liberties to degrade thy equals to extinguish Schism so
called and set up despotism on the wrecks of all

Huge projectFIER TRIUMVIRATwhat not From Roussillon and the
sunny Pyrenees to frozen Russia all arm for Austria and march at her
bidding They concert my downfall trample on my rights

The Daughter of the Caesars proudly certain of victoryt is the
way of the Great whose commonplace virtue pusillanimous in reverses
overbearing in success cannot bridle their cupiditydesignates to the
Triumvirate what Kings are to be proscribed Britannic George and me
Reich busy on us both even now and those ungrateful tyrants by united
crime immolate to each other without remorse their dearest allies
For instance

 O jour digne doubli Quelle atroce imprudence
 Therese cest lAnglais que tu vends a la France

Theresa it is England thou art selling to FranceYes a thing worth
noting Thy generous support in thy first adversities thy one friend
then when a world had risen to devour thee Thou reignest nowbut it
was England alone that saved thee anything to reign over

 Tu regnes mats lui seul a sauve tes etats
 Les bienfaits chez les rois ne font que des ingrats

And thou lazy Monarchstupid Louis let us omit himPompadour
selling her lover to the highest bidder makes France in our day
Austrias slave We omit Kolin Battle too spoken of with a proud
modesty Prag is not spoken of at all and how the neighboring ravenous
Powers onlookers hitherto have opened their throats with one accord
to swallow Prussia thinking its downfall certain Poor mercenary
Sweden once so famous under its soldier Kings now debased by a venal
SenateSweden what say I my own kindred foolish Anspach and
others driven by perverse motives join in the plot of horrors and
become satellites of the prospering Triumvirs

And thou loved People my own Prussians whose happiness is my charge
notable how often he repeats this it is thy lamentable destiny it is
the danger which hangs over thee that pierces my soul The pomps of my
rank I could resign without regret But to rescue thee in this black
crisis I will spend my hearts blood Whose IS that blood but thine
With joy will I rally my warriors to avenge thy affront defy death at
the foot of the ramparts of Daun and his Eckartsberg ahead yonder
and either conquer or be buried under thy ruins Very well but ah

Preparing with such purpose ye Heavens what mournful cries are those
that reach us Death haa laid low thy MotherHah that was the last
stroke then which angry Fate had reserved for meO Mother Death
flies my misfortunes and spreads his livid horrors over thee Very
tender very sad what he says of his Mother but must be omitted and
imagined General finale is

Thus Destiny with a deluge of torments fills the poisoned remnant of my
days The present is hideous to me the future unknown what you say I
am the creature of a BENEficent Being

 Quoi seraisfe forme par un Dieu bienfaisati
 Ah sil etait si bon tendre pour son ouvrage
 Husht my little Titan

And now ye promoters of sacred lies go on leading cowards by the
nose in the dark windings of your labyrinthto me the enchantment
is ended the charm disappears I see that all men are but the sport of
Destiny And that if there do exist some Gloomy and Inexorable Being
who allows a despised herd of creatures to go on multiplying here he
values them as nothing looks down on a Phalaris crowned on a Socrates
in chains on our virtues our misdeeds on the horrors of war and all
the cruel plagues which ravage Earth as a thing indifferent to him
Wherefore my sole refuge and only haven loved Sister is in the arms
of Death

 Ainsi mon seul asile et mon unique port
 Se trouve chere soeur dans les bras de la mort
 OEuvres xii 3642 is sent off to Wilhelmina 24th August

2 WILHELMINA TO VOLTAIRE WITH SOMETHING OF ANSWER First of certain
intercalary Prose PiecesWilhelmina has been writing to Voltaire
before and getting consolations since Kolin but her Letters are lost
till this the earliest that is left us

BAIREUTH 19th AUGUST 1757 TO VOLTAIREOne first knows ones
friends when misfortunes arrive The Letter you have written does honor
to your way of thinking I cannot tell you how much I am sensible to
what you have done set Cardinal Tencin astir with result we will
hope The King my Brother is as much so as I You will find a Note
here which he bids me transmit to you Note lost That great man
is still the same He supports his misfortunes with a courage and a
firmness worthy of him He could not get the Note transcribed It began
by verses Instead of throwing sand on it he took the inkbottle that
is the reason why it is cut in two This Note we say is lost to
usall but accidentally thus Voltaire 12th September writes twice
to friends Writing to his DArgentals he says The affairs of this
King Friedrich go from bad to worse I know not if I told you of the
Letter he wrote to me about three weeks ago say August 17th18th this
same Note through Wilhelmina evidently I have learned says he
that you had interested yourself in my successes and misfortunes There
remains to me nothing but to sell my life dear c His Sister writes
me one much more lamentable the one we are now reading

I am in a frightful state and will not survive the destruction of my
House and Family That is the one consolation that remains to me You
will have fine subjects for making Tragedies of O times O manners
You will by the illusory representation perhaps draw tears while all
contemplate with dry eyes the reality of these miseries the downfall of
a whole House against which if the truth were known there is no solid
complaint I cannot write farther of it my soul is so troubled that I
know not what I am doing But whatever happen be persuaded that I am
more than ever your friendWILHELMINA In _OEuvres de Frederic_
lxxvii 30

Friedrich while Wilhelmina writes so is at the foot of the
Eckartsberg eagerly manoeuvring with the Austrians in hopes of getting
battle out of themwhich he cannot Friedrich while he wrote that
Note to Voltaire and instead of sandbox shook the inkbottle over it
was just going out on that errand

VOLTAIRE 12th SEPTEMBER to a Lady whose Son is in the DEstrees wars
Ib lxxii 55 56Here are mighty revolutions Madame and we are
not at the end yet They say there have 18000 Hanoverians been disposed
of at Stade Convention of KlosterZeven That is no small matter I
can hope M Richelieu who is MON HEROS when I write to himself will
adorn his head with the laurels they have stuck in his pocket I wish
Monsieur your Son abundance of honor and glory without wounds and to
you Madame unalterable health The King of Prussia has written me a
very touching Letter one line of which we have read but I have always
Madame Deniss adventure on my heart at Frankfurt yonder If I were
well I would take a run to Frankfurt myself on the businessnow
that Soubises reserves are in those parts and could give Freytag and
Schmidt such a dusting for me if they liked Shall I write to Collini
on it Does write and again write the second year hence as still
better chances rise Collini pp 208211 JanuaryMay 1759

3 WILHELMINA TO VOLTAIRE AGAIN WITH ANSWER Second of the Prose
PiecesNot a very zealous friend of Friedrichs after all this
Voltaire Poor Wilhelmina terrified by that EPITRE of her Brothers
and his fixed purpose of seeking Death has in her despair though
her Letter is lost been urging Voltaire to write dissuading himas
Voltaire does Of which presently Her Letter to Voltaire on this
thriceimportant subject is lost But in the very hours while Voltaire
sat writing what we have just read always with Madame Deniss
adventure on my heart Wilhelmina at Baireuth is again writing to him
as follows

BAIREUTH 12th SEPTEMBER 1757 TO VOLTAIREYour Letter has sensibly
touched me that which you addressed to me for the King both Letters
lost to us has produced the same effect on him I hope you will be
satisfied with his Answer as to what concerns yourself but you will be
as little so as I am with the resolutions he has formed I had flattered
myself that your reflections would make some impression on his mind
You will see the contrary by the Letter adjoined To me there remains
nothing but to follow his destiny if it is unfortunate I have never
piqued myself on being a philosopher though I have made my efforts to
become so The small progress I made did teach me to despise grandeurs
and riches but I could never find in philosophy any cure for the wounds
of the heart except that of getting done with our miseries by ceasing
to live The state I am in is worse than death I see the greatest
man of his age my Brother my friend reduced to the frightfulest
extremity I see my whole Family exposed to dangers and perhaps
destruction my native Country torn by pitiless enemies the Country
where I am Reichs Army Anspach what not menaced by perhaps similar
misfortune Would to Heaven I were alone loaded with all the miseries I
have described to you I would suffer them and with firmness

Pardon these details You invite me by the part you take in what
regards me to open my heart to you Alas hope is wellnigh banished
from it Fortune when she changes is as constant in her persecutions
as in her favors History is full of those examplesbut I have found
none equal to the one we now see nor any War as inhuman and as cruel
among civilized nations You would sigh if you knew the sad situation
of Germany and Preussen The cruelties which the Russians commit in that
latter Country make nature shudder Details horrible but authentic in
_HeldenGeschichte _ already cited How happy you in your Hermitage
where you repose on your laurels and can philosophize with a calm mind
on the deliriums of men I wish you all the happiness imaginable If
Fortune ever favor us again count on all my gratitude I will never
forget the marks of attachment which you have given my sensibility is
your warrant I am never halfandhalf a friend and I shall always be
wholly so of Brother VoltaireWILHELMINA

Many compliments to Madame Denis Continue I pray you to write to the
King In _Voltaire_ ii 197199 lxxvii 57

VOLTAIRE TO WILHELMINA Day uncertain THE DELICES SEPTEMBER
1757Madam my heart is touched more than ever by the goodness and
the confidence your Royal Highness deigns to show me How can I be but
melted by emotion I see that it is solely your nobleness of soul that
renders you unhappy I feel myself born to be attached with idolatry to
superior and sympathetic minds who think like you You know how much
I have always essentially and at heart been attached to the King
your Brother The more my old age is tranquil and come to renounce
everything and make my retreat here a home and country the more am
I devoted to that PhilosopherKing I write nothing to him but what
I think from the bottom of my heart nothing that I do not think most
true and if my Letter dissuasive of seeking Death wait reader
appears to your Royal Highness to be suitable I beg you to protect it
with him as you have done the foregoing In _Voltaire_ lxxvii 37

4 FRIEDRICH TO WILHELMINA AND BY ANTICIPATION HER ANSWER Third of
the Prose PiecesKIRSCHLEBEN NEAR ERFURT 17th SEPTEMBER 1757My
dearest Sister I find no other consolation but in your precious
Letters May Heaven reward so much virtue and such heroic sentiments

Since I wrote last to you my misfortunes have but gone on
accumulating It seems as though Destiny would discharge all its wrath
and fury upon the poor Country which I had to rule over The Swedes
have entered Pommern The French after having concluded a Neutrality
humiliating to the King of England and themselves KlosterZeven
which we know are in full march upon Halberstadt and Magdeburg From
Preussen I am in daily expectation of hearing of a battle having been
fought the proportion of combatants being 25000 against 80000 was
fought GrossJagersdorf 30th August and lost accordingly The
Austrians have marched into Silesia whither the Prince of Bevern
follows them I have advanced this way to fall upon the corps of the
allied Army which has run off and intrenched itself behind Eisenach
amongst hills whither to follow still more to attack them all rules
of war forbid The moment I retire towards Saxony this whole swarm will
be upon my heels Happen what may I am determined at all risks to
fall upon whatever corps of the enemy approaches me nearest I shall
even bless Heaven for its mercy if it grant me the favor to die sword
in hand

Should this hope fail me you will allow that it would be too hard to
crawl at the feet of a company of traitors to whom successful crimes
have given the advantage to prescribe the law to me How my dear my
incomparable Sister how could I repress feelings of vengeance and of
resentment against all my neighbors of whom there is not one who did
not accelerate my downfall and will not share in our spoils How can a
Prince survive his State the glory of his Country his own reputation
A Bavarian Elector in his nonage Son of the late poor Kaiser and
left shipwrecked in his seventeenth year or rather in a sort of
subjection to his Ministers and dull to the biddings of honor may
give himself up as a slave to the imperious domination of the House of
Austria and kiss the hand which oppressed his Father I pardon it to
his youth and his ineptitude But is that the example for me to follow
No dear Sister you think too nobly to give me such mean LACHE
advice Is Liberty that precious prerogative to be less dear to a
Sovereign in the eighteenth century than it was to Roman Patricians of
old And where is it said that Brutus and Cato should carry magnanimity
farther than Princes and Kings Firmness consists in resisting
misfortune but only cowards submit to the yoke bear patiently their
chains and support oppression tranquilly Never my dear Sister could
I resolve upon such ignominy

If I had followed only my own inclinations I should have ended it JE
ME SERAIS DEPECHE at once after that unfortunate Battle which I lost
But I felt that this would be weakness and that it behooved me to
repair the evil which had happened My attachment to the State awoke
I said to myself It is not in seasons of prosperity that it is rare to
find defenders but in adversity I made it a point of honor with
myself to redress all that had got out of square in which I was not
unsuccessful not even in the Lausitz after those Zittau disasters
last of all But no sooner had I hastened this way to face new enemies
than Winterfeld was beaten and killed near Gorlitz than the French
entered the heart of my States than the Swedes blockaded Stettin
Now there is nothing effective left for me to do there are too many
enemies Were I even to succeed in beating two armies the third would
crush me The enclosed Note in cipher will show you what I am still
about to try it is the last attempt

The gratitude the tender affection which I feel towards you that
friendship true as the hills constrains me to deal openly with you
No my divine Sister I shall conceal nothing from you that I intend to
do all my thoughts all my resolutions shall be open and known to you
in time I will precipitate nothing but also it will be impossible for
me to change my sentiments

As for you my incomparable Sister I have not the heart to turn you
from your resolves We think alike and I cannot condemn in you the
sentiments which I daily entertain EPROUVE Life has been given to us
as a benefit when it ceases to be such I have nobody left in this
world to attach me to it but you My friends the relations I loved
most are in the grave in short I have lost everything If you take
the resolution which I have taken we end together our misfortunes and
our unhappiness and it will be the turn of them who remain in this
world to provide for the concerns falling to their charge and to bear
the weight which has lain on us so long These my adorable Sister are
sad reflections but suitable to my present condition

The day before yesterday I was at Gotha yes see aboveand
tomorrow if I knew it Seidlitz with pictorial effects will be
there

But it is time to end this long dreary Letter which treats almost of
nothing but my own affairs I have had some leisure and have used it
to open on you a heart filled with admiration and gratitude towards
you Yes my adorable Sister if Providence troubled itself about human
affairs you ought to be the happiest person in the Universe Your not
being such confirms me in the sentiments expressed at the end of my
EPITRE In conclusion believe that I adore you and that I would give
my life a thousand times to serve you These are the sentiments which
will animate me to the last breath of my life being my beloved Sister

WILHELMINAS ANSWERby anticipation as we said written 15th
September while Friedrich was dining at Gotha in quest of Soubise

BAIREUTH 15th SEPTEMBER 1757 My dearest Brother your Letter and the
one you wrote to Voltaire my dear Brother have almost killed me What
fatal resolutions great God Ah my dear Brother you say you love me
and you drive a dagger into my heart Your EPITRE which I did receive
made me shed rivers of tears I am now ashamed of such weakness My
misfortune would be so great in the issue there alluded to that I
should find worthier resources than tears Your lot shall be mine I
will not survive either your misfortunes or those of the House I belong
to You may calculate that such is my firm resolution

But after this avowal allow me to entreat you to look back at what
was the pitiable state of your Enemy when you lay before Prag It is
 occur again when one is least expecting it Caesar was the slave of
Pirates and he became the master of the world A great genius like
yours finds resources even when all is lost and it is impossible this
frenzy can continue My heart bleeds to think of the poor souls in
Preussen Apraxin and his Christian Cossacks therewho it is noted
far excel the Calmuck worshippers of the DalaiLama What horrid
barbarity the detail of cruelties that go on there I feel all that you
feel on it my dear Brother I know your heart and your sensibility for
your subjects

I suffer a thousand times more than I can tell you nevertheless hope
does not abandon me I received your Letter of the 14th by W who W
is no mortal knows What kindness to think of me who have nothing to
give you but a useless affection which is so richly repaid by yours
I am obliged to finish but I shall never cease to be with the most
profound respect TRESPROFOND RESPECTthat and something still
better if my poor pen were not embarrassed

September 1757  passionate enough wandering wildly over human
life and sincere almost to shrillness in parts which Voltaire has
also got hold of Omissible here the fixity of purpose being plain
otherwise to Voltaire and us Voltaires counterarguments are weak or
worse That Roman death is not now expected of the Philosopher that
your Majesty will in the worst event still have considerable Dominions
left all that your GreatGrandfather had still plenty of resources
that in Paris Society an estimable minority even now thinks highly
of you that in Paris itself your Majesty does not say expressly as
dethroned and going on your travels would have resources To which
beautiful considerations Friedrich answers not with fire and brimstone
as one might have dreaded but in this quiet manner REPONSE AU SIEUR
VOLTAIRE

 Je suis homme il suffit et ne pour la souffrance
 Aux rigueurs du destin joppose ma constance

I am a man and therefore born to suffer to destinys rigors my
steadfastness must correspondQuotation from I know not whom

But with these sentiments I am far from condemning Cato and Otho The
latter had no fine moment in his life except that of his death Breaks
off into Verse

 Croyez que si jetais Voltaire
 Et particulier comme lui
 Me contentant du necessaire
 Je verrais voltiger la fortune legere

Orto wring the water and the jingle out of it and give the substance
in Prose

Yes if I were Voltaire and a private man I could with much composure
leave Fortune to her whirlings and her plungings to me contented
with the needful her mad caprices and sudden topsyturvyings would be
amusing rather than tremendous

I know the ennui attending on honors the burdensome duties the jargon
of grinning flatterers those pitiabilities of every kind those details
of littleness with which you have to occupy yourself if set on high on
the stage of things Foolish glory has no charm for me though a
Poet and King when once Atropos has ended me forever what will the
uncertain honor of living in the Temple of Memory avail One moment
of practical happiness is worth a thousand years of imaginary in such
TempleIs the lot of high people so very sweet then Pleasure gentle
ease true and hearty mirth have always fled from the great and their
peculiar pomps and labors

No it is not fickle Fortune that has ever caused my sorrows let her
smile her blandest let her frown her fiercest on me I should sleep
every night refusing her the least worship But our respective
conditions are our law we are bound and commanded to shape our temper
to the employment we have undertaken Voltaire in his hermitage in a
Country where is honesty and safety can devote himself in peace to
the life of the Philosopher as Plato has described it But as to me
threatened with shipwreck I must consider how looking the tempest in
the face I can think can live and can die as a King

 Pour moi menace du naufrage
 Je dois en affrontant lorage
 Penser vivre et mourir en roi
 _OEuvres_ xxiii 14

This is of October 9th this ends worthily the LamentationPsalms
work having now turned up which is a favorable change Friedrichs
notion of suicide we perceive is by no means that of puking up ones
existence in the weak sick way of FELO DE SE but far different that
of dying if he needs must as seems too likely in uttermost spasm of
battle for self and rights to the last From which latter notion nobody
can turn him A valiantly definite lucid and shiningly practical
soulwith such a power of always expectorating himself into clearness
again If he do frankly wager his life in that manner beware ye
Soubises Karls and flaccid trivial persons of the stroke that may
chance to lie in him




III RUMOR OF AN INROAD ON BERLIN SUDDENLY SETS FRIEDRICH ON MARCH
THITHER INROAD TAKES EFFECTWITH IMPORTANT RESULTS CHIEFLY IN A
LEFTHAND FORM

October 11th express arrived important express from General Finck who
is in Dresden convalescent from Kolin and is even Commandant there of
anything there is to command That the considerable Austrian Brigade
or Outpost which was left at Stolpen when the others went for Silesia
is all on march for Berlin Here is news The whole 15000 of
them report addsthough it proved to be only a Detachment picked
Tolpatches mostly and of nothing like that strength shot off under a
swift General Haddick on this errand Between them and Berlin is not
a vestige of force and Berlin itself has nothing but palisades and
perhaps a poor 4000 of garrison March instantly you Moritz who lie
nearest cross Elbe at Torgau I follow instantly orders Friedrich
His Message to Moritz ORLICH p 73 Rodenbeck p 322 dubious or
wrongand that same night is on march or has cavalry pushed ahead
for reinforcement of Moritz

Friedrich not doubting but there would be captaincy and scheme among
his Enemies considered that the Swedes and perhaps the Richelieu
French were in concert with this Austrian movementfrom east
from north from west three Invasions coming on the core of his
Dominionsand that here at last was work ahead and plenty of it
That was Friedrichs opinion and most other peoples when the Austrian
inroad was first heard of mere triple ruin coming to this King as
the Gazetteers judgedgreat alarm prevailing among the Kings friends
in Berlin very great Friedrich glad at any rate to have done with
that dismal lingering at Buttelstadt hastens to arrange himself for
the new contingencies to post his Keiths his Ferdinands with their
handfuls of force to best advantage and push ahead after Moritz by
Leipzig Torgau Berlinwards with all his might At Leipzig in such
press of business and interestjudge by the following phenomenon what
a cleargoing soul this is and how completely on a level with whatever
it may be that he is marching towards

LEIPZIG 15th OCTOBER 1757 Interview with GottschedAt 11 this
morning Majesty came marching into Leipzig multitudes of things to
settle there things ready things not yet ready in view of the great
events ahead Seeing that he would have time after dinner he at once
sent for Professor Gottsched a gigantic gentleman Reigning King of
German Literature for the time being to come to him at 3 PM Reigning
King at that time since gone wholly to the DustbinsPopular
Delusion as old Samuel defines it having since awakened to itself
with scornful hahas upon its poor Gottsched and rushed into other
roads worse and better its poor Gottsched become a name now signifying
Pedantry Stupidity learned Inanity and the Worship of Colored Water
to every German mind

At 3 precise the portly old gentleman towards sixty now huge of
stature with a shrieky voice and speaks uncommonly fast bowed himself
in and a Colloquy ensued on Literature and so forth of the kind we
may conceive Colloquy which had great fame in the world Gottsched
himself havingsuch the inaccuracy of rumor and Dutch Newspapers on
the matterpublished authentic Report of it Next Year in a principal
Leipzig Magazine with name signed given in _HeldenGeschichte_ iv
728739 with multifarious commentaries and flourishings denoting an
attentive world Nicolai _Anekdoten_ iii 286290 now one of the
dullest bits of reading and worth no mans bit of time Colloquy which
lasted three hours with the greatest vivacity on both sides King
impugning for one principal thing the roughness of German speech
Gottsched in swift torrents far too copious in such company ready to
defend Those consonants of ours said the King they afflict ones
ear what Names we have all in mere Ks and Ps KNAP KNIP KLOP
KROTZ KROKyour own Name for exampleYes his own Name

the King Hear in contrast the music of this Stanza of Rousseaus
Repeats a stanza Who could express that in German with such melody
And so on branching through a great many provinces Kings knowledge
of all Literature new and ancient perfectly astonishing to me and
I myself the swiftspeaking Gottsched rather copious than otherwise
Catastrophe and summary of the whole was Gottsched undertook to
translate the Rousseau Stanza into German of moderate softness and
by the aid of water did so that very night Copied duly in
_HeldenGeschichte_ iv 726 sent it next day and had within an
hour a gracious Royal Answer in verse calling one incidentally
Saxon Swan CYGNE SAXON though one is such a Goose Majesty to march
at 7 tomorrow morning said a Postscriptno Interviewing more at
present

About ten days after not to let this thing interrupt us again
Friedrich on his return to Leipzig had another Interview with
Gottsched of only one hour this timebut with many topics Reading
of some Gottsched Ode ODE very tedious frothy watery of THANKS to
Majesty for such goodness to the Saxon Swan reading too of some of
Madam Gottscheds Pieces Majesty confessed afterwards Every hour
from the very first had lowered his opinion of the Saxon Swan till at
length Goosehood became too apparent Friedrich sent him a gold snuffbox
by and by but had no farther dialoguing

A saying of Excellency Mitchells to Gottschedfor Gottsched on that
second Leipzig opportunity went swashing about among the Kings Suite
as wellis still remembered They were talking of Shakspeare Genial
if you will said Gottsched but the Laws of Aristotle Five Acts
unities strictAristotle What is to hinder a man from making
his Tragedy in Ten acts if it suit him better Impossible your
ExcellencyPooh said his Excellency suppose Aristotle and
general Fashion too had ordered that the clothes of every man were to
be cut from five ells of cloth how would the Herr Professor like with
these huge limbs of his if he found there were no breeches for him on
Aristotles account Adieu to Gottsched most voluminous of menwho
wrote a Grammar of the German Language which they say did good
I remember always his poor Wife with some pathos who was a fine
graceful loyal creature of ten times his intelligence and did no
end of writing and translating and compiling Addisons CATO Addisons
SPECTATOR thousands of things from all languages on order of her
Gottsched till life itself sank in such enterprises never doubting
tragically faithful soul but her Gottsched was an authentic Seneschal

Invasion Austrian Swedish French

BAIREUTH 15th October 1757

frightful state I am in There run reports that make me shudder Some
say you are wounded others dangerously ill In vain have I tormented
myself to have news of you I can get none Oh my dear Brother come
what may I will not survive you If I am to continue in this frightful
uncertainty I cannot stand it I shall sink under it and then I
shall be happy I have been on the point of sending you a courier but
environed as we are I durst not In the name of God bid somebody
write me one word

I know not what I have written my heart is torn in pieces I feel
that by dint of disquietude and alarms I am losing my wits Oh my dear
adorable Brother have pity on me Heaven grant I be mistaken and that
you may scold me but the least thing that concerns you pierces me to
the heart and alarms my affection too much Might I die a thousand
times provided you lived and were happy

I can say no more Grief chokes me and I can only repeat that your
fate shall be mine being my dear Brother your

courage and firmness avail us

I am now in motion and having once got into that you may calculate I
shall not think of sitting down again except under improved omens
If outrage irritates even cowards what will it do to hearts that have
courage

I foresee I shall not be able to write again for perhaps six weeks
which fails not to be a sorrow to me but I entreat you to be calm
during these turbulent affairs and to wait with patience the month of
December paying no regard to the Nurnberg Newspapers nor to those of
the Reich which are totally Austrian

I am tired as a dog COMME UN CHIEN I embrace you with my whole
heart being with the most perfect affection TENDRESSE my dearest

The Haddick affair after all the rumor about it proved to be a very
small matter No Swede or Richelieu had dreamt of cooperating
Haddick in the end was scarce 4000 with four cannon General Rochow
Commandant of Berlin with his small garrison had not Haddick skilfully
slidden through woods and been so magnified by rumor might have
marched out and beaten a couple of Haddicks As it was Haddick
skilfully emerging at the Silesian Gate of Berlin 16th October
about eleven in the morning demanded ransom of 300000 thalers 45000
pounds was refused began shooting on the poor palisades on the
poor drawbridge there at the third shot brought down the drawbridge
rushed into the suburb and was not to be pushed out again by the
weak party Rochow sent to try it Rochow ignorant of Haddicks force
marched off thereupon for Spandau with the Royal Family and effects
leaving Haddick master of the suburb and Berlin to make its own bargain
with him Haddick his Croats not to be quite kept from mischief
remained master of the suburb minatory upon Berlin for twelve hours or
more and after a good deal of bargainingransom of 45000 pounds of
90000 pounds finally of 27000 pounds and two dozen pair of gloves
to the Empress Queenmade off about five in the morning wind
of Moritzs advance adding wings to the speed of Haddick
_HeldenGeschichte_ iv 715723 Haddicks own Account and the Berlin
one

Moritz did arrive next evening 18th but with his tired troops there
was no catching of Haddick now three marches ahead Royal Family and
effects returned from Spandau the day following but in a day or
two more removed to Magdeburg till the Capital were safe from such
affronts Much grumbling against Rochow What could I do How could I
know answered Rochow whose eyesight indeed had been none of the best
Berlin smarts to the length of 27000 pounds and an alarm but asserts
not quite mythically thinks Retzow that the two dozen pair of
gloves were all gloves for the left handBerlin having wit and a
touch of ABSINTHE in it capable of such things Friedrich heard
the news at Annaburg a march beyond Torgau and there paused again
uncertain for about a week coming after which he discovered that
Leipzig would be the place and returned thither appointing a general
rendezvous and concentration there




SCENE AT REGENSBURG IN THE INTERIM

Just while Haddick was sliding swiftly through the woods Berlin now
nigh there occurred a thing at Regensburg tragic thing but ending in
farceFinale of REICHSACHT in shortabout which all Regensburg was
loud wailing or hahaing according to humor while Berlin was paying
its ransom and lefthand gloves One moments pause upon this though
our haste is great

Reichs Diet had got its Ban of the Reich ready for Friedrich CITATIO
solemn Summons and all else complete nothing now wanted but to serve
Citatio on him or insinuate it into him as their phrase iswhich
latter essential point occasions some shaking of wigs Dangerous
serving Citatio in that quarter and by what art try to smuggle it into
the hands of such a one Insinuate it here into his Plothos hand
that is the method and that will suffice say the wigs and choose
an unfortunate Reichs Notary Dr Aprill to do it who in ponderous
Chancerystyle gives the following affecting reportwonderful but
intelligible when abridged

Citatio to come and receive your Bana very solemnsounding
Document commencing or perhaps it is Aprill himself that so commences
no matter which In the Name of the Most High God the Father Son
and Holy Ghost Amenwas given Wednesday 12th October in the
Year after Christ our dear Lord and Saviours Birth 1757 Years To me
Georgius Mathias Josephus Aprill sworn Kaiserlich Notarius Publicus
In my Lodging firstfloor fronting south in Jacob Virnrohr the
Innkeepers House here at Regensburg called the RedStar for
insinuation into Plotho

With which solemn Piece Aprill proceeded next day Thursday
halfpast 2 PM to Plothos dwellingplace described with equal
irrefragability and continues Aprill did there by a servant of
the Herr Ambassador von Plothos announce myself adding that I had
something to say to his Excellency if he would please to admit me To
which the Herr Ambassador by the same servant sent answer that he was
ill with a cold and that I might speak to his Secretarius what I had to
say But as I replied that my message was to his Excellenz in person
the same servant came back with intimation that I might call again
tomorrow at noon

Tomorrow at the stroke of noon Friday 14th October Aprill
punctually appears again with recapitulation of the pledge given him
yesterday and is informed that he can walk upstairs I proceeded
thereupon the servant going before up one pair of stairs or with
the appurtenances GEZEUGEN rather more than one pair into the
Herr Ambassador Freiherr von Plothos Anteroom who just as we were
entering stept in himself through a sidedoor in his dressinggown
and with the words Speak now what you have to say

I thereupon slipt into his hand CITATIO FISCALIS and saidsaid
at first nothing Plotho avers merely mumbled looked like some poor
caitiff come with Lawpapers on a trifling Suit we happen to have
in the Courts hereand only by degrees said let us abridge SCENE
Aprill and Plotho Anteroom in Regensburg firstfloor and rather
higher

APRILL I have to give your Excellenz this Writingwhich privately
could your Excellenz guess it is CITATIO FISCALIS from the Reichstag
summoning his Majesty to show cause why Ban of the Reich should not pass
upon him His Excellenz at first took the CITATIO and adjuncts from me
and looking into them to see what they were his Excellenzs face began
to color and soon after to color a little more and on his looking
attentively at CITATIO FISCALIS he broke into violent anger and rage
so that he could not stand still any longer but with burning face and
both arms held aloft rushed close to me CITATIO and adjuncts in his
right hand and broke out in this form

PLOTHO What insinuate INSINUIEREN you scoundrel

APRILL It is my Notarial Office I must do it In spite of which the
Freiherr von Plotho fell on me with all rage grasped me by the front of
the cloak and said

PLOTHO Take it back wilt thou And as I resisted doing so he stuck
it in upon me and shoved it down with all violence between my coat
and waistcoat and still holding me by the cloak called to the two
servants who had been there Fling him down stairswhich they being
discreet fellows and in no flurry did not quite nor needed quite to
do Must sir you see unless and so forced me out of the house
Excellenz Plotho retiring through his Anteroom and his Bodyservant
who at first had been on the stairs likewise disappearing as I got
under wayand have to report in such manner to the Universe
and Reichs Diet with tears in my eyes Preuss ii 397401 in
_HeldenGeschichte _ iv 745749 Plothos Account

What became of Reichs Ban after this ask not It fell dead by
Friedrichs victories now at hand rose again into life on Friedrichs
misfortunes August 1758 threatening to include George Second in it
upon which the CORPUS EVANGELICORUM made some countermumblementand
I have heard the French privately advised Better drop it these two
Kings are capable of walking out of you and dangerously kicking the
table over as they goWhereby it again fell dead positively for the
last time and in short is worth no mention or remembrance more

CORPUS EVANGELICORUM had always been against Reichs Ban a few
Dissentients or HalfDissentients exceptedas Mecklenburg wholly
and with a will foolish Anspach wholly and the Anhalts haggling some
dissent and retracting it why I never knewfor which Mecklenburg
and the Anhalts lying within clutch of one had to repent bitterly in
the years coming Enough of all that

The Haddick invasion which had got its gloves lefthand or not
and part of its roadexpenses brought another consequence much more
important on the PERCONTRA side The triumphing TEDEUMing and
jubilation over itHis Metropolis captured Royal Family in
flightraised the Dauphiness Army and especially Versailles
into such enthusiasm that Dauphiness came bodily out on order from
Versailles spread over the Country plundering and insulting beyond
example got herself reinforced by a 15000 from the Richelieu Army
crossed the Saale determined on taking Leipzig beating Friedrich and
I know not what Keith in Leipzig with a small Party had summons from
Soubises vanguard October 24th Keith answered He would burn the
suburbsupon which said vanguard hearing of Friedrichs advent
withal took itself rapidly away And Soubise and it would fain have
recrossed Saale I have understood had not Versailles been peremptory

In a word Friedrioh arrived at Leipzig October 26th Ferdinand Moritz
and all the others coming or already come and there is something great
just at hand Friedrichs stay in Leipzig was only four days Cheering
prospect of work now ahead hereadd to this assurance from Preussen
that Apraxin is fairly going home and Lehwald coming to look after
the Swedes Were it not that there is bad news from Silesia things
generally are beginning to look up Of the hour spent on Gottsched
in these four days we expressly take no notice farther but there was
another visit much less conspicuous and infinitely more important that
of a certain Hanoverian Graf von Schulenburg not in red or with plumes
like a MajorGeneral as he was but in the black suit of a Country
Parsoncoming in that unnoticeable guise to inform Friedrich
officially That the Hanoverians and Majesty of England have resolved
to renounce the Convention of KlosterZeven to bring their poor Stade
Army into the field again and do now request him King Friedrich
to grant them Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick to be General of the same

Here is an unnoticeable message of very high moment indeed To which
Friedrich already prepared gives his cheerful consent nominations and
practicalities to follow the instant these present hurries are over
Who it was that had prepared all this whose suggestion it first was
Friedrichs Mitchells Georges Pitts I do not knowI cannot
help suspecting Pitt Pitt and Friedrich together And certainly of all
living men Ferdinandrelated to the English and Prussian royalties
a soldier of approved excellence and likewise a nobleminded
prudent patient and invincibly valiant and steadfast manwas beyond
comparison the fittest for this office Pitt is now fairly in power
and perceivessuch Pitts originality of viewthat an Army with a
Captain to it may differ beautifully from one without And in fact we
may take this as the first twitch at the reins on Pitts part whose
delicate strong hand all England running to it with one heart will be
felt at the ends of the earth before many months go To the great and
unexpected joy of Friedrich for one England has taken long to produce
a great man he said to Mitchell but here is one at last





BOOK XVIII CONTINUEDSEVENYEARS WAR RISES TO A HEIGHT 17571759




Chapter VIIIBATTLE OF ROSSBACH

Friedrich left Leipzig Sunday October 30th encamped that night on
the famous Field of Lutzen with the vanguard he as usual and Mayer
with him who did some brisk smiting home of what French there were
Keith and Duke Ferdinand following with main body and rear

Movements on the SoubiseHildburghausen part are all retrograde
againcan Dauphiness Bellona do nothing then except shuttle forwards
and then backwards according to Friedrichs absence or presence The
SoubiseHildburghausen Army does immediately withdraw on this occasion
as on the former and makes for the safe side of the Saale again
rapidly retreating before Friedrich who is not above one to two of
themmore like one to three now that Broglios Detachment is come
to hand Broglio got to Merseburg October 26thguess 15000
strongconsiderably out of repair and glad to have done with such a
march and be within reach of Soubise This is the Second Son of our old
Blusterous Friend a man who came to some mark and to a great deal of
trouble in this War and ended readers know how at the Siege of the
Bastille thirtytwo years afterwards

So soon as rested Broglio by order moves leftwards to Halle to guard
Saale Bridge there Soubise himself edging after him to Merseburg on a
similar errand and leaving Hildburghausen to take charge of Weissenfels
and the Third Saale Bridge That is Dauphinesss posture while Friedrich
encamps at Lutzenlet impatient human nature fix these three places
for itself and hasten to the catastrophe of wretched Dauphiness
Soubise it ought to be remembered is not in the highest spirits but
his Officers in overhigh Doing this PETIT MARQUIS DE BRANDEBOURG
the honor to have a kind of War with him DE LUI FAIRE UNE ESPECE DE
GUERRE as they term it Being puffed up with general vanity and the
newspaper rumor about Haddicks featwhich like the gloves it got
is going all to lefthand in this way Hildburghausen and the others
overrule Soubise and indeed there is no remedy Provision almost
outhow retreat to our magazines and our fastnesses with Friedrich
once across Saale and sticking to the skirts of us Here from
eyewitnesses where possible are the successive steps of Dauphiness
towards her doom which is famous in the world ever since

Monday 31st October 1757 as the TownSyndic of Weissenfels
records about eight in the morning Muller SCHLACHT BEI ROSSBACH a
Centenary Piece Berlin 1857containing several curious Extracts
p 44 _HeldenGeschichte_ iv 643 651668 the King of Prussia with
his whole Army or what seemed to us the whole though it was but
a half Keith with the other half being within reach to northward
marching Merseburg way came before this Town Has been here before
as Keith has as Soubise and others have a town much agitated lately by
transit of troops It was from the eastern or high landward side where
the socalled Castle is that Friedrich came Castle built originally on
some White Crag WEISSE FELS not now conspicuous from which the town
and whilom Duchy take their name

We have often heard of Weissenfels while the poor old drunken Duke
lived who used to be a Suitor of Wilhelminas liable to hard usage
and have marched through it with the Salzburgers in peaceable times
A solid pleasantenough little place 6000 souls or so lies leant
against high ground White Crags or whatever it once was on the
eastern or right bank of the Saale a Town in part flat in part very
steep the streets of it or main street and secondaries running off
level enough from the River and Bridge rising by slow degrees but at
last rapidly against the high ground or cliffs just mentioned a
stiff acclivity of streets till crowned by the socalled Castle the
Augustus Burg in those days the FriedrichWilhelm Barrack in ours
It was on this crown of the cliffs that his Prussian Majesty appeared

Saale is of good breadth here has done perhaps two hundred miles
since he started in the Fichtelgebirge PINE MOUNTAINS on his long
course Elbeward received only ten miles ago his last big branch the
widewandering Unstrut coming in with much drainage from the northern
partsin breadth Saale may be compared to Thames to Tay or Beauley
his depth not fordable though nothing like so deep as Thamess main
cargo visible is rafts of timber banks green definite scant of
wood river of rather dark complexion mainly noiseless but of useful
pleasant qualities otherwise

From this Castle or landward side come Friedrich and his Prussians on
Monday morning about eight The garrison some 4000 Reichs folk and
a French Battalion or two shut the Gates and assembled in the
Marketplacea big square close at the foot of the Heights on the
other hand from the top of the Heights KLAMMERK the particular spot
the Prussians cannonaded Town and Gates to speedy bursting open of the
same and rushed in over the walls of the Castlecourt and by other
openings into the Town so that the garrison above said had to quit and
roll with all speed across the Saale Bridge and set the same on fire
behind them This was their remedy for all the Three Bridges when
attacked but it succeeded nowhere so well as here

The fire was of extreme rapidity prepared beforehand Bridge all
of dry wood coated with pitchfire reinforced too in view of such
event by all the suet lard and oleaginous matter the Garrison could
find in Weissenfels some hundredweights of tallowdips for one
item going up on this occasion Bridge worth 100000 thalers
is instantly ablaze some 400 finding the bridge so flamy and the
Prussians at their skirts were obliged to surrenderFeldmarschall
Hildburghausen sleeping about two miles off gets himself awakened in
this unpleasant manner Flying garrison halt on the other side of the
River where the rest of their Army is plant cannon there against
quenching of the Bridge and so keep firing answered by the Prussians
with much noise and no great mischief till 3 PM when the Bridge is
quite gone Tollkeepers Lodge and all and the enterprise of crossing
there had plainly become impossible

Friedrich quickly about a mile farther down the River has picked out
another crossingplace in the interim and founded some new adequate
plank or raft bridge there which by diligence all night will
be crossable tomorrow So that except for amusing the enemy the
cannonading may cease at Weissenfels A certain Duc de Crillon
in command at this Weissenfels Bridgeburning and cannonade has a
chivalrous Anecdote amounting nearly to zero when well examined about
saving or sparing Friedrichs life on this interesting occasion How
being now on the safe side of the River he Crillon with his staff
taking some refection of breakfast after the furious flurry there had
been there came to him one of his Artillery Captains stationed in
an Island in the River asking Shall I shoot the King of Prussia
Monseigneur He is down reconnoitring his end of the Bridge shant I
then To whom Crillon gives a glass of wine and smilingly magnanimous
answer to a negative effect _Memoires militaires de Louis c Duc
de Crillon _ Paris 1791 p 166as cited by Preuss ii 88
Concerning which one has to remark Not only FIRST that the Artillery
Captains power of seeing Friedrich which is itself uncertain would
indeed mean the power of aiming at him but differs immensely from that
of hitting him with shot so that this Shall I kill the King was
mainly thrasonic wind from Captain Bertin But SECONDLY that there is
no Island in the River thereabouts for Captain Bertin to fire from
So that probably the whole story is wind or little more dreamlike or
at best some idle thrasonictheoretic question on the part of Bertin
proper answer thereto consisting mainly in a glass of wine from
Monseigneurall which on retrospection Monseigneur feels or would
fain feel to have been not theoreticthrasonic but practical and of a
rather godlike nature Zero mainly as we said Friedrich thanks you for
zero Monseigneur

The Prussians were billeted in the Town that night says our Syndic
and in many a house there came to be twenty men and even thirty and
above it lodged All was quiet through the night the French and the
Reichs folk were drawn back upon the higher grounds about Burgwerben
and on to Tagwerben and we saw their watchfires burning Friedrichs
Bridge meanwhile unmolested by the enemy is getting ready

Keith looking across to Merseburg on the morrow morning Tuesday Nov
1st whither he had marched direct with the other Half of the Army
finds Merseburg Bridge destroyed or broken and Soubise with batteries
on the farther side intending to dispute the passage Keith despatches
Duke Ferdinand to Halle another twelve miles down who finds Halle
Bridge destroyed in like manner and Broglio intending to dispute
which however on second thoughts neither of them I did Friedrichs
new Bridge at HerrenMuhle LORDSHIPS MILL is of course an important
point to them Friedrichs passage now past dispute Let us fall back
say they and rank ourselves a little we are 50 or 60000 strong ill
off for provisions but well able to retreat and have permission to
fight on this side of the River

The combined Army Dauphiness or whatever we are to call it does on
Wednesday morning November 2d gather in its cannon and outskirts and
give up the Saale question retire landwards to the higher grounds some
miles and diligently get itself united and into order of battle better
or worse near the Village of Mucheln which means Kirk MICHAEL and is
still written SANCT MICHEL by some on this occasion There Dauphiness
takes post leaning on the heights not in a very scientific way
leaving Keith and Ferdinand to rebuild their Bridges unmolested and all
Prussians to come across at discretion Which they have diligently done
2d3d November by their respective Bridges and on Thursday afternoon
are all across encamped at Bedra in close neighborhood to Mucheln
which Friedrich has been out reconnoitring and finds that he can attack
next morning very early

Next morning accordingly by 2 oclock with a bright moon shining
Friedrich is on horseback his Army following But on examining by
moonlight the enemy have shifted their position turned on their axis
more or less into new woodpatches new batteries and bogs which
has greatly mended their affair No good attacking them so thinks
Friedrich and returns to his Camp slightly cannonaded one wing of
him from some battery of the enemy and immoderately crowed over by
them Dare not you see Tried and was defeated cry their newspapers
and theyfor one day Friedrich lodges again in Bedra this night
others say in Rossbach shifts his own Camp a little left wing of it
now at Rossbach HOMEBROOK or BECK soon to be a worldfamous Hamlet
the effects of hunger on the Dauphiness so far from her supplies will
he calculates be stronger than on him and will bring her to better
terms shortly Dauphiness needs bread one may have fine clipping at the
skirts of her if she try retreat That Dauphiness would play the prank
she did next morning Friedrich had not ventured to calculate




CATASTROPHE OF DAUPHINESS Saturday 5th November 1757

Meandering Saale is on one of his big turns as he passes Weissenfels
turning pretty rapidly here from southeastward which he was a dozen
miles ago round to northeastward again or northward altogether which
he gets to be at Merseburg a dozen farther down Right across from
Weissenfels lapped in this crook of the Saale or washed by it on south
side and on east rises with extreme laziness a dull circular lump of
country six or eight miles in diameter with Rossbach and half a dozen
other scraggy sleepy Hamlets scattered on itwhich till the morning
of Saturday 5th November 1757 had not been notable to any visitor
The topmost point or points for there are two not discoverable except
by tradition and guess the country people do call Hills JANUSHUGEL
POLZENHUGELHill sensible to wagonhorses in those bad loose tracks of
sandy mud but unimpressive on the Tourist who has to admit that there
seldom was so flat a Hill Rising let us guess forty yards in
the three or four miles it has had Might be called a perceptibly
potbellied plain with more propriety flat country slightly puffed
upin shape not steeper than the mould of an immense teasaucer would
be Teasaucer 6 miles in diameter 100 feet in depth and of irregular
contour which indeed will sufficiently represent it to the readers
mind

Saale at four or five miles distance bounds this scraggy lump on the
east and on the south Westward and northward springing about Mucheln
on each hand and setting off to right and to left Saaleward are what
we take to be two brooks at least are two hollows and behind these
the country rises higher undulating still on lazy terms but now
painted azure by the distance not unpleasant to behold with its litter
all lapped out of sight and its poor brooks tinkling forward as we
judge into the Saale Merseburg way or reversewise into the Unstrut
the last big branch of Saale Southward from our Janus Height eight or
nine miles off may be seen some vestige of Freiburg steeple or gilt
weathercock faintly visible on the Unstrut yonderwhich I take to
be Soubises breadbasket at present And farther off and opposite the
MOUTH of the Unstrut well across the Saale lies another namable Town
visible in clear weather as a smokecloud at certain hours about
mealtime when the kettles are on boil the Town of Naumburgone of
several German Naumburgsthe Naumburg of Gustaf Adolf where his slain
body lay on the night of Lutzen Battle with his poor Queen and
others weeping over it Naumburg is on the other side of Saale not of
importance to Soubise in such posture

This is the circular block or lump of country on the north or northwest
side of which Friedrich now lies and which will become he little
thinks how memorable on the morrow Over the heights immediately
eastward of Friedrich there is a kind of hollow or scoopedout place
shallow valley of some extent which deserves notice against tomorrow
but in general the ground is lazily spherical and without noticeable
hollows or valleys when fairly away from the River A dull blunt lump of
country made of sand and mudmay have been grassy once with broom on
it in the pastoral times is now under poor ploughhusbandry arable or
scratchable in all parts and looks rather miserable in wintertime No
vestige of hedge on it of shrub or bush one tree ugly but big which
may have been alive in Friedrichs time stands not far from Rossbach
Hamlet one and no more discoverable in these areas

Various Hamlets lie sprinkled about very sleepy rusty irregular
little places huts and cattlestalls huddled down as if shaken from
a bag much straw thick thatch and crumbly mudbrick but looking warm
and peaceable for the Fourfooted and the Twofooted which latter if
you speak to them are solid reasonable people with energetic German
eyes and hearts though so illlodged These Hamlets needing shelter
and springwater stand generally in some slight hollow if well up the
Height as Rorschach is sometimes if near the bottom they are nestled
in a sudden dell or gashwork of the primeval rains accumulating from
above and ploughing out their way The rains we can see have been
busy but there is seldom the least stream visible bottom being too
sandy and porous On the western slope there is in our time a kind of
coal or coaldust dug up in the way of quarrying not of mining and
one or two big chasms of this sort are confusedly busy the natives mix
this valuable coaldust with water mould it into bricks and so use as
fuel one of the features of these hamlets is the strange black bricks
standing on edge about the cottagedoors to drip and dry in the sun
For this or for other reasons the westward slope appears to be the
best and has a major share of hamlets on it Rossbach is high up and
looks over upon Mucheln and its dim belfry and appurtenances which lie
safe across the hollow perhaps two miles offsafe from Friedrich if
there were eatables and lodging to be had in such a place Friedrichs
left wing is in Rossbach Bedra where Friedrichs right wing is
Branderode where the Soubise right is then Grost Schevenroda
Zeuchfeld Pettstadt Lunstadtespecially Reichartswerben where
Soubises right will come to be these the reader may take note of in
his Map Several of them lie in ashes just then plundered replundered
and at last set fire to so busy have Soubises hungry people been
of late in the Country they came to deliver The Freiburg road the
Naumburg road both towards Merseburg cross this Height straight like
the string Saale by Weissenfels being the bow

The HERRENHAUS Squires Mansion still stands in Rossbach with
the littery Hamlet at its flank a high pavilionroofed and though
dilapidated pretentious kind of House some kind of court round it
some kind of hedge or screen of brushwood and brickwall terribly in
need of the besom it and its environment throughout King I suppose
did lodge there overnight certain it is the Squire was absent and
the Squires Man three days afterwards reported to him as follows
Saturday the 5th about 8 AM his Majesty mounted to the roof of
the Herrenhaus here some tiles having been removed for that end or
by accident is not said and saw how the French and Reichs Army were
getting in movementwriggling out of their Camp leftwards evidently
aiming towards Grost In about an hour near half their Army was
through Grost and had turned southward rather southeastward from
Grost out in the Rossbach and Almsdorf region and proceeding still
towards Pettstadttowards Schevenroda more precisely not towards
Pettstadt yet His Majesty looked always through the perspective and
to me was the grace done to be ever at his side and to name for him
the roads the French and Reichs Army was marching Muller p 50
Rodenbeck p 326

The King had heard of this phenomenon hours before and had sent out
Hussars and scouts upon it but now sees it with his eyesGoing for
Freiburg and their breadcupboard thinks the King who does not as
yet make much of the movement but will watch it well and calculates to
have a stroke at the rear end of it in due season With which view the
cavalry Seidlitz and Mayer are ordered to saddle foot regiments and
all else to be in readiness This FrenchReichs Dauphiness is not rapid
in her fieldexercise and has a great deal of wriggling and unwinding
before she can fairly pick herself out and get forward towards
Schevenroda on the Freiburg road In three or in two parallel columns
artillery between them horse ahead horse arear haggling along
theremaking for their breadbaskets thinks the King A body
of French horse chiefly under St Germain come out in the
SchortauAlmsdorf part with some salvoing and prancing as if intending
to attack about Rossbach where our left wing is but his Majesty sees
it to be a pretence merely and St Germain motionless and doing
nothing but cannonade a little seems to agree that it is so Dauphiness
continues her slow movements King in this Squires Mansion of
Rossbach sits down to dinner dinner with Officers at the usual hour of
noonlittle dreaming what the Dauphiness has in her head

Truth is the Dauphiness is in exultant spirits this morning intending
great things against a certain little Marquis of Brandenburg to whom
one does so much honor Generals looking down yesterday on the King of
Prussias Camp able to count every man in it and half the men being
invisible owing to bends of the ground counted him to 10000 or so
and had said Pshaw are not we above 50000 let us end it Take him
on his left Round yonder till we get upon his left and even upon his
rear withal St Germain cooperating on the other side of him on left
on rear on front at the same moment is not that a sure game A very
ticklish game answers surly sagacious Lloyd No general will permit
himself to be taken in flank with his eyes open and the King of Prussia
is the unlikeliest you could try it with

Trying it meanwhile they are marching along by the low grounds here
intending to sweep gradually leftwards towards JanusHill quarter there
to sweep home upon him coil him up left and rear and front in their
boaconstrictor folds and end his trifle of an Army and him Why not
if we do our duty at all annihilate his trifle of an Army take himself
prisoner and so end it Report says Soubise had really in some
moment of enthusiasm lately warned the Versailles populations to expect
such a thing and that the Duchess of Orleans forgetful of poor King
Louiss presence had in HER enthusiasm exclaimed TANT MIEUX I shall
at last see a King then But perhaps it is a mere French epigram such
as the winds often generate there and put down for factFriedrichs
retreat to Weissenfels is cut off for Friedrich an Austrian party has
been at the HerrenMuhle Bridge this morning has torn it up and pitched
it into the river planks far on to Merseburg by this time And in
fact unless Friedrich be nimbleBut that he usually is

Friedrichs dinner had gone on with deliberation for about two hours
Friedrichs intentions not yet known to any but everybody great and
small waiting eagerly for them like greyhounds on the slipwhen
Adjutant Gaudi who had been on the Housetop the while rushes into the
Diningroom faster than he ought and with some tremor in his voice and
eyes reports hastily At Schevenroda at Pettstadt yonder Enemy has
turned to left Clearly for the leftWell and if he do No flurry
needed Captain answered FriedrichNOT in these precise words but
rebuking Gaudi with a look not of laughter wholly and with a certain
question as to the state of Gaudis stomachic part which is still
known in traditionary circles but is not mentionable hereand went
with due gravity himself to the roof with his Officers To the
left sure enough meaning to attack us there the thing Friedrich had
despaired of is voluntarily coming thenand it is a thing of stern
qualities withal a wager of life with glorious possibilities behind

Friedrich earnestly surveys the phenomenon for some minutes in some
minutes Friedrich sees his way through it at least into it and how
he will do it Off eastward march Swift are his orders almost still
swifter the fulfillment of them Prussian Army is a nimble article in
comparison with Dauphiness In half an hours time all is packed and
to the road and except Mayer and certain FreeCorps or LightHorse
to amuse St Germain and his Almsdorf people there is not a Prussian
visible in these localities to French eyes At halfpast two says the
Squires Manor let us take him a sentence earlier to lose nothing
of such a Document At noon his Majesty took dinner sat till about
two oclock then again went to the roof and perceived that the
Enemys Army at Pettstadt were turning about the little Wood there
northeastward as if for Lunstadt into the Lunstadt roadsuch
cannonading too from those Almsdorf people that the balls flew over
our headsor I tremulously thought so At halfpast two the word
was given March And good speed they made about it in this Herrenhaus
and out of doors too striking their tents and cording up and trimly
shouldering everything with incredible brevity as if machinery were
doing it and at three on the Prussian part all was packed and out
into the court for being carried off and in fact the Prussian Army
was on march at three Seidlitz with all his Horse vanishing round
the corner of the Height speeding along invisible on his northern
slope there straight for the JanusPolzen Hill part the Infantry
following doublequickwell knowing each what he has got to do

But at this interesting point the Editorssmall thanks to them
authentic but thricestupid mortalscut short our Eyewitness not
so much as telling us his name some of them not even his date or
whereabouts and so the curtain tumbles down as if its string had
been cut or suddenly eaten by unwise animals and we are left to gray
hubbub and our own resources at secondhand Except only that a French
Officerone of those cannonading from Almsdorf no doubtdeclares
that it was like a change of scene in the Opera DECORATION DOPERA
Letter in MULLER p 60 In WESTPHALEN ii 128133 is a much superior
French Letter intercepted somewhere and fallen to Duke Ferdinand well
worth reading on Rossbach and the previous Affairs so very rapid and
that they all rolled off eastward at quick time At extremely quick
timeand soon in the slight hollow behind Janus Hugel vanished from
sight of these Almsdorf French and of the SoubiseHildburghausen Army
in general Which latter is agreeably surprised at the phenomenon
and draws a highly flattering conclusion from it Gone then off
at doublequick for Merseburg aha think the SoubiseHildburghausen
people Doublequick you too my pretty men lest they do whisk away
and we never get a stroke at them

Seidlitz meanwhile with his cavalry thirtyeight squadrons about
4000 horse is rapidly doing the order he has had Seidlitz at a sharp
military trot and the infantry at doublequick to keep up near him
which they cannot quite do are as we have said making right across
for the PolzenHill and JanusHill quarter their route the string
French route the bow and are invisible to the French owing to the
heights between Seidlitz when he gets to the proper point eastward
will wheel about front to southward and be our left wing infantry as
centre and right will appear in like manner andwe shall see

The exultant Dauphiness or SoubiseHildburghausen Army let us call it
for brevitys sake Dauphiness or French which it mainly was on that
rapid disappearance of the Prussians never doubted but the Prussians
were off on flight for Merseburg to get across by the Bridge there
Whereat Dauphiness doubly exultant mended her own pace cavalry at
a sharp trot infantry doublequick but unable to keep upfor the
purpose of capturing or intercepting the runaway Prussians Speed
my friendsif you would do a stroke upon Friedrich and show the
Versailles people a King at last Thus they hurrying on in two
parallel columnsinfantry long floods of it coming doublequick but
somewhat fallen behind cavalry 7000 or so as vanguardfaster and
faster sweeping forward on their southern side of the JanusandPolzen
slope and now rather climbing the same

Seidlitz has his hussar pickets on the top to keep him informed as
to their motions and how far they are got Seidlitz invisible on the
south slope of the Polzen Hugel finds about halfpast three PM that
he is now fairly ahead of Dauphiness Seidlitz halts wheels comes
to the top Got the flank of them sure enoughand without waiting
signal or farther orders every instant being precious rapidly forms
himself and plunges down on these poor people Compact as a wall and
with an incredible velocity DUNE VITESSE INCROYABLE says one
of them Figure the astonishment of Dauphiness of poor Broglio who
commands the horse here Taken in flank instead of taking other people
intercepted not in the least needing to intercept Has no time to
form though he tried what he could Only the two Austrian regiments
got completely formed the rest very incompletely and Seidlitz in the
blaze of rapid steel is in upon them The two Austrian regiments
and two French that are named made what debate was feasiblecourage
nowise wanting in such sad want of captaincy nay Soubise in person
galloped into it if that could have helped But from the first the
matter was hopeless Seidlitz slashing it at such a rate and plunging
through it and again through it thrice some say four times so that
in the space of half an hour this luckless cavalry was all tumbling off
the ground plunging downhill in full flight across its own infantry
or whatever obstacle Seidlitz on the hips of it and galloping madly
over the horizon towards Freiburg as it proved and was not again heard
of that day

In about half an hour that bit of work was over and Seidlitz with
his ranks trimmed again had drawn himself southward a little into the
Hollow of Tageswerben there to wait impending phenomena For Friedrich
with the Infantry is now emerging over Janus Hill in a highly
thunderous mannereighteen pieces of artillery going and four big
guns taken from the walls of Leipzig and there will be events anon
It is said Hildburghausen at the first glimpse of Friedrich over
the hilltop whispered to Soubise We are lost Royal
HighnessCourage Soubise would answer and both let us hope did
their utmost in this extremely bad predicament they had got into

Friedrichs artillery goes at a murderous rate had come in view over
the hilltop before Seidlitz endednothing but the muzzles of
it visible and the firetorrents from it to us poor French below
Friedrichs lines or rather his one line mere tip of his left
wingonly seven battalions in it five of them under Keith from the
second or reserve line whole centre and right wing standing refused
in oblique rank invisible BEHIND the HillFriedrichs line we say
the artillery to its right shoots out in mysterious Prussian rhythm
in echelons in potences obliquely down the JanusHill side straight
rigid regular as iron clockwork and strides towards us silent
with the lightning sleeping in itFriedrich has got the flank of
Dauphiness and means to keep it Once and again and a third time poor
Soubise with his poor regiments much in an imbroglio here heaped on
one another there with wide gaps halt being so suddenattempts
to recover the flank and pushes out this regiment and the other
rightward to be even with Friedrich But sees with despair that it
cannot be that Friedrich with his echelons potences and mysterious
Prussian resources pulls himself out like the pieces of a
prospectglass piece after piece hopelessly fast and seemingly no
end to them and that the flank is lost and thatUnhappy Generals of
Dauphiness what a phenomenon for them A terrible Friedrich not fled
to Merseburg at all but mounted there on the Janus Hill as on his
saddlehorse with face quite the other wayand for holsterpistol
has plucked out twentytwo cannon Clad verily in fire Chimeralike
RIDING the Janus Hill in that manner left leg or wing of him
spurning us into the abysses right one ready to help at discretion

Hildburghausen I will hope does his utmost Soubise Broglio for
certain do The French line is in front next the Prussians poor
Generals of Dauphiness are panting to retrieve themselves But with
regiments jammed in this astonishing way and got collectively into the
lions throat what can be done Steady rigid as iron clockwork the
Prussian line strides forward at forty paces distance delivers its
first shock of lightning bursts into platoon fire and so continues
steady at the rate of five shots a minutehard to endure by poor
masses all in a coil The artillery tore down whole ranks of us says
the Wutenberg Dragoon His Letter in MULLER p 83 the Prussian
musketry did terrible execution

Things began o waver very soon French reeling back from the Prussian
fire Reichs troops rocking very uneasy torn by such artillery when
to crown the matter Seidlitz seeing all things rock to the due extent
bursts out of Tageswerben Hollow terribly compact and furious upon the
rear of them Which sets all things into inextricable tumble and the
Battle is become a rout and a riding into ruin no Battle ever more
Lasted twentyfive minutes this second act of it or till halfpast
four after which the curtains rapidly descending Nights curtain
were there no other cover the remainder the only stagedirection
EXEUNT OMNES Which for a 50 or 60000 ridden over by Seidlitz Horse
was not quite an easy matter They left of killed and wounded near

Prussian loss was 165 killed 376 woundedbetween a sixteenth and a
fifteenth part of theirs in number the Prussians had been little more
than one to three 22000 of all armsnot above half of whom ever came
into the fire Seidlitz and seven battalions doing all the fighting that

Saale there bent homewards through the Weimar Country one wild flood
of ruin swift as it could go at Erfurt only one regiment was in

disgustingly unhappy from the first and was now fallen fluid on these
mad terms flowed all away in different rills each by the course

ULTERIOR FATE OF DAUPHINESS FLIES OVER THE RHINE IN BAD FASHION
DAUPHINESSS WAYS WITH THE SAXON POPULATION IN HER DELIVERANCEWORK

Friedrich had no more fighting with the French November 9th
at Merseburg in all stillness Duke Ferdinand got his Britannic
Commission his full Powers from Friedrich and the parties interested
in all stillness made his arrangements as if for Magdeburg and his
Governorship thereFriedrich hastening off for Silesia the while Duke
Ferdinand did stay six days in Magdeburg inspecting or pretending to
inspect very pleasant with his Sister and the Royalties that are now
there but at midnight of day sixth shot off silently on wider errand
And in sum on Thursday 24th November 1757 appeared in Stade on
horseback at morning parade there intimating to what joy of the poor
Brunswick Grenadiers and others That he was come to take command
that KlosterZeven is abolished that we are not an Observation Army
rotting here in the parish pound any longer but an Allied Army such
now our title intending to strike for ourselves and get out of pound
straightway

THURSDAY 24th NOVEMBERTUESDAY 29th Duke Ferdinand did accordingly
pick up the reins of this distracted Affair and in a way wonderful
to see shot sanity into every fibre of it and kept it sane and
roadworthy for the Five Years coming With a silent velocity an
energy an imperturbable steadfastness and clear insight into cause and
effect which were creditable to the school he came from and were
a very joyful sight to Pitt and others concerned So that from next
Tuesday November 29th before daylight when Ferdinands batteries
began playing upon Harburg French Fortress nearest to Stade the reign
of the French ceased in those Countries and an astonished Richelieu and
his French lying scattered over all the West of Germany in readiness
for nothing but plunder had to fall more or less distracted in their
turn and do a number of astonishing things To try this and that of
futile more or less frantic nature be driven from post after post be
driven across the Aller first of allRichelieu to go home thereupon
and be succeeded by one still more incompetent

DECEMBER 13th a fortnight after Ferdinands appearance Richelieu had
got to the safe side of the Aller burning of Zelle Bridge and Zelle
Town there his last act in Germany Ferdinands quarters now wide
enough and vigorous speed of preparation going on for farther chase
were the weather mended FEBRUARY 17th 1758 Ferdinand was on foot
again Prince de Clermont the still more incompetent successor of
Richelieu gazing wideeyed upon him but doing nothing else and for
the next six weeks there was seen a once triumphant RichelieuDEstrees
French Army much in rags much in disorder in terror and here and
there almost in despairwinging their way like clouds of draggled
poultry caught by a mastiff in the corn Across Weser across Ems
finally across the Rhine itself every feather of themtheir
longdrawn cackle of a shrieky type filling all Nature in those
months the mastiff steadily following Mauvillon i 252284 9th
November 17571st April 1758 Westphalen i 316503 abundantly
explicit authentic and even entertainingwith the ample
Correspondences ib ii 147350 Schaper _Vie militaire du Marechal
Prince Ferdinand_ 2 tomes 8vo Magdebourg 1796 1799 i 7100 a
careful Book of an official exactitude like Westphalensand appears
to be left incomplete like his To the astonishment of Pitt and
mankind Can this be the same Army that Royal Highness led to the Sea
and the Parish Pound The same identically wasted to about twothirds
by Royal Highness not a drum in it changed otherwise only One Man
differentand he is the important one

Pitt when the news of Rossbach came awakening the bonfires and
steeplebells of England to such a pitch had resolved on an emphatic
measure that of sending English Troops to reinforce our Allied Army
and its new Generalsuch an Ally as that Rossbach one being rare in
the eyes of Pitt Postpone the meeting of Parliament yet a few days
your Majesty said Pitt till I get the estimates ready Thackeray
i 310 To which Majesty assented and all England with him Englands
own Cause thinks Pitt with confidence our way of Conquering
Americaand in the circumstances our one way English did land
accordingly first instalment of them a 12000 in August next
increased gradually to 20000 with no end of furnishings to them and
everybody with results again satisfactory to Pitt and very famous in
the England that then was dim as they are now grown

The effect of all which was that Pitt with his Ferdinands and
reinforcements found work for the French ever onwards from Rossbach
French also turning as if exclusively upon perfidious Albion and the
thing became in Teutschland as elsewhere a duel of life and
death between these natural enemiesTeutschland the centre of
itTeutschland and the accessible French SeaTownsbut the
circumference of it going round from Manilla and Madras to Havana and
Quebec again Widespread furious duel prize America and life By land
and sea handsomely done by Pitt on both elements Land part we say
was always mainly in Germany under Ferdinandin Hessen and
the Westphalian Countries as far west as Minden as far east as
FrankfurtonMayn generally well north of Rhine well south of Elbe
that was for five years coming the cockpit or place of deadly fence
between France and England Friedrichs arena lies eastward of that
occasionally playing into it a little and played into by it and always
in lively sympathy and consultation with it but except the French
subsidizings diplomatizings and great diligenae against him in foreign
Courts Friedrich is in practical respects free of the French
and ever after Rossbach Ferdinand and the English keep them in full
workgrowing yearly too full A heavy Business for England and
Ferdinand which is happily kept extraneous to Friedrich thenceforth to
him and us which is not on the stage of his affairs and ours but is
to be conceived always as vigorously proceeding alongside of it close
beyond the scenes and liable at any time to make tragic entry on him
againof which we shall have to notice the louder occurrences and
cardinal phases but for the future nothing more

Soubise who had crept into the skirts of the Richelieu Army in Hanover
or Hessen Country had of course to take wing in that general fright
before the mastiff Soubise did not cross the Rhine with it Soubise
made off eastward Westphalen i 501 end of March 1758found
new roost in HanauFrankfurt Country and had thoughts of joining the
Austrians in Bohemia next Campaign but got new ordersuch the pinches
of a winged Clermont with a mastiff Ferdinand at his poor draggled
tailand came back to the Ferdinand scene to help there and never
saw Friedrich again Both Broglio and he had a good deal of fighting
mostly beating from Ferdinand and a great deal of trouble and sorrow
in the course of this War but after Rossbach it is not Friedrich or
we it is Ferdinand and the Destinies that have to do with them Poor
Soubise except that he was the creature of Generalissima Pompadour
which had something radically absurd in it did not deserve all the
laughter he got a man of some chivalry some qualities As for Broglio
I remember always not without human emotion the two extreme points of
his career as a soldier Rossbach and the Fall of the Bastille He was
towards forty when Friedrich bestrode the Janus Hill in that fiery
manner he was turned of seventy when from the pavements of Paris
the Chimera of Democracy rose on him in fire of a still more horrible
description

DauphinessBellona in her special and in her widest sense has made
exit then Gone like clouds of draggled poultry home across the Rhine
She was the most marauding Army lately seen also the most gasconading
and had the least capacity for fighting three worse qualities no army
could have How she fought we have seen sufficiently Before taking
leave of her forever readers as she is a paragon in her kind would
perhaps take a glance or two at her marauding qualitiesby a good
opportunity that offers Plotho at Regensburg that a supreme Reichs
Diet may know what a deliverance of Saxony this has been submits one
day the following irrefragable Documents which have happened not
without good industry of my own to fall into my Plothos hands
They are Documents partly of epistolary partly of a Petitionary form
presented to Polish Majesty out of that Saxon Country and have an
AFFIDAVIT quality about them one and all

1 BIG DAUPHINESS that is DEstrees IN THE WESEL COUNTRIES AT AN
EARLY STAGEWHILE STILL ENDEAVORING WHAT SHE COULD TO BEHAVE WELL
HANGING 1000 MARAUDERS AND THE LIKE A private Letter

COUNTY MARK 20th JUNE 1757 The French troops are going on here in a
way to utterly ruin us Schmidt their President of Justice whom they
set up in Cleve has got orders to change all the Magistracies of the
Country Protestant by nature so as that half the members shall be
Catholic Bielefeld was openly plundered by the French for three hours
long You cannot by possibility represent to yourself what the actual
state of misery in these Countries is A SCHEFFEL of rye costs three
thalers sixteen groschen who knows how many times its natural price
And now we are to be forced to eat the spoiled meal those French troops
brought with them which is gone to such a state no animal would have
it This poisoned meal we are to buy from them ready money at the
price they fix and that famine may induce us they are about to stop
the mills and forcibly take away what little breadcorn we have left
God have pity on us and deliver us soon Next week we are to have
a transit of 6000 Pfalzers KurPfalz foolish idle fellow and
KurBaiern too are both in subsidy of France as usual 6000
Pfalzers just due here these I suppose will sweep us clean bare

Wesel Fortress Gate of the Rhine could not be defended by Friedrich
and the Hanover Incapables and England still all in St Vitus would
not hear of undertaking it left it wide open for the French never
could recover it or get the RhineGate barred again during the whole
War One hopes they repentedbut perhaps it was only Pitt and Duke
Ferdinand that did so instead The Wesel Countries were at once
occupied by the French a conquest of her Imperial Majestys
continued to be administered in Imperial Majestys nameand are
thriving as above

2 DAUPHINESS PROPER that is Soubise IN THURINGEN AT A LATE STAGE

LETTER FROM FREIBURG SHORTLY AFTER ROSSBACHIt was on the 23d
October a Sunday that we of Freiburg had our first billeting of
French a body of Cavalry from different regiments going to take
Leipzig take Torgau what not and from that day Freiburg never
emptied of French who kept marching through it in extraordinary
quantities The marching lasted fourteen days namely till the 6th
November day AFTER Rossbach when they burnt our poor Bridge and
marched for the last time and often the billeting was so heavy that
in a single house there were forty or fifty men Who at all times had to
be lodged and dieted gratis nay many householders over and above
the ordinary meal were obliged to give them money too and many poor
people who can scarcely get their own bit of bread had to run and
bring at once their sixteen or eighteen groschen pence worth of wine
not to speak of coffee and sugar And a great increase of the mischief
it was always that the soldiers and common people did not understand
one anothers languageHeavy billeting but what was that Vast
nearly impossible quantities of forage and provision were wrung from
us as from all the other Towns and Villages about under continual
threatening to burn and raze us from the earth Often did our French
Colonel threaten He would have the cannon opened on Freiburg
straightway Nay had it stood by foraging we might have reckoned
ourselves lucky But our straits increased day by day and sheer
plundering became more and more excessive

The robbing and torturing of travellers the plundering and burning of
Saxon Villages Almost all the Towns and Villages hereabouts are so
plundered out that many a one now has nothing but what he carries on
his body Plundering was universal and no sooner was one party away
than another came and still another and often the same house was three
or four times plundered Branderode a Village two leagues from this
stands on the Field of Rossbach if we look is so ruined out that
nobody almost has anything left Chief Inspector Baron von Boses
Schloss there with its splendid appointments they ruined utterly took
all money victuals valuables furniture clothes linen and beds all
they could carry what could not be carried away they cut hewed and
smashed to pieces broke the winecasks and even tore up the documents
and letters they found lying in the place Branderode Dorf was twice
set fire to by them and was at last with Zeuchfeld which is an
Amtsdorfafter both had been plunderedreduced to ashes The
Churches of Branderode and Zeuchfeld with several other Churches were
plundered the altars broken the altarcloths and other vestures cut
to pieces and the sacred vessels and cups carried awayexcept for we
have a notarial exactness and will exaggerate nothing that in the case
of Branderode they sent the cup back Of the pollution of the altars
and of the blasphemous songs these people sang in the churches one
cannot think without horror

And it was merely our pretended Allies and Protectors that have
desecrated our divine service utterly wasted our Country reduced the
inhabitants to want and desperation and in short have so behaved that
you would not know this region again Truly these troops have realized
for us most of the infamies we heard reported of the Cossacks and their
ravagings in Preussen lately

It is one of their smallest doings that they robbed a Saxon Clergyman
name and circumstances can be given if required three times over on
the public Highway shot at him tied him to a horses tail and dragged
him along with them so that he is now lying ill in danger of his life
On the whole it is our beloved Pastors Clergymen most of all that
have been plundered of everything they had

Balgart and Zschieplitz both Villages half a league from this have
likewise been heavily plundered they have even left the Parson nothing
but what he wore on his back Grost another Rossbach place which
belongs to the Kammerjunker Heldorf has likewise OHE SATISAll
this happened between the 23d and 31st October consequently before the
Battle In many Villages you see the trees and fields sprinkled with
feathers from the beds that have been slit up

In several Villages belonging to the Royal Electoral privy Councillor
von Bruhl who is properly the fountain of all this and of much other
misery to us if we knew it the plundering likewise had begun and a
quantity of about a hundred swine so ho had been cut in pieces
but in the midst of their work the Allies heard that these were Bruhl
estates and ceased their havoc of them These accordingly are the only
lands in all this region whose fate has been tolerable

The appellation every moment renewed of Heretic was the courteous
address from these people to our fellowChristians heretic dogs
KETZERISCHE HUNDE was a PRADICAT always in their mouth

In Weischutz a mile or two from us up the Unstrut a French Colonel
who wanted to ride out upon the works made the there Pastor Magister
Schren stoop down by way of horseblock and mounted into the saddle
from his back Messieurs you will kindle the wrath of mankind some
day and get a terrible plucking with those high ways of yours

Churches are all smashed obscene songs were sung in form of litany
from the pulpits and altars what was done with the communionvessels
when they were not worth stealingis hideous to the religious sense
and shall not be mentioned in human speech


3 THE BROGLIO REINFORCEMENT COMING ACROSS TO JOIN SOUBISE AND PERFORM
AT ROSSBACH Humble Petition from the Magistrates of Sangerhausen To
the King of Polands Majesty

SANGERHAUSEN 23d OCTOBER 1757Scarcely had we with profound
submission ALLERUNTERTHANIGST under date of the 13th current
represented to your Royal Majesty and Electoral Translucency how heavily
we were pressed down by the forage requisitions and transits of troops
and the consequent expenditure in food drinking in oats and hay
which no one payswhen directly thereafter on the 14th of October
a new French party of the Fischer CorpsFischer is a mighty Hussar
scarcely inferior to Turpin and stands in astonishing authority
with Richelieu and an Army whose object is plunder Ferdinands
Correspondente SOEPIUS _Westphalen_ i 40127 c cnew party
of the Fischer Corps of some sixty men and horse arrived in the Town
demanded meat drink oats and hay and all things necessary which they
received from usand not only paid not one farthing for all this but
furthermore some of them instead of thanks to their Landlord Rossold
forcibly broke up his press drank his brandy and carried off a TOUTE
gatherall with money in it From a Tanner Lindauer by name they
bargained for a buckskin and having taken would not pay it In the
RATHSKELLER Town Publichouse they drank much wine and gave nothing
for it nay on marching offbecause no mounted guide REITENDER BOTE
was at hand and though they had before expressly said none such would
be neededthey rushed about like distracted persons WIE RASENDE
LEUTE in the marketplace and in the streets beat the people tumbled
them about and lugged them along in a violent manner using abusive
language to a frightful extent and threatening every misfortune

Hardly were we rid of this confusion and astonishment when on October
21st a whole swarm of horses men women children and wagons which
likewise all belonged to the Fischer Corps and were commanded by
FirstLieutenant Schmidt came into our Town This troop consisted of
80 men part infantry part cavalry with some 80 workhorses 10
baggagewagons and about 100 persons women sick people and the
like They stayed the whole night here made meat drink corn hay
and whatever they needed be brought them and went off next day without
paying anything

Our Inns were now almost quite exhausted of forage in corn or hay and
we knew not how we were to pay what had been spentwhen the thirty
French Light Cavalry of whom we with profound submission on the
13th HUJUS gave your Royal Majesty and Electoral Translucency account
renewed their visit upon us came under the command of Rittmeister
de Mocu on the 22d of October while the baggagewagons workhorses
women sick and so forth were hardly gone towards evening into the
Town consumed in meat and drink oats and hay and the like what they
could lay hold of and next morning early marched away paying as their
custom is nothing

Not enough thatbesides the great foragecontribution LIEFERUNG
which we already with profound submission notified to your Royal
Majesty and Electoral Translucency as having been laid upon us and
that by order of the Duc de Broglio a new requisition is now laid on
us and we have had to engage for sixtyfour more sacks of wheat
and thirtytwo of rye as is noted under head A in the enclosed
copythere has farther come on us on the part of the Reichs Army
from KreisCommissarius Heldorf whose Schloss of Grost we perceive
they have since burnt by way of thanks to him Supra No 2 the
simultaneous Order for instant delivery of Forage as under head B here
enclosed Thus are we at the appointed places all at once to furnish
such quantities more than we can raise and know not when or where we
shall either for what has been already furnished or for what is
still to be receive one penny of money nay over and above we are to
sustain the many marchings of troops and provide to the same what meat
drink oats hay and so on they require without the least return of
payment

So unendurable and taken all together so hard SIC begins the
conduct of these troops that profess being come as friends and helpers
to appear to us And Heaven alone knows how long under a continuance of
such things the subjects whom the Hailstorm of last year had at any
rate impoverished shall be able to support the same We would were a
reasonable delivery of forage laid upon us even at a low price and the
board and billet of the marching troops paid to us even in part lay out
our whole strength in helping to bear the burdens of the Fatherland but
if such things go on which will soon leave us only bare life and empty
huts we can look forward to nothing but our ruin and destruction But
as it is not your Royal Majestys and Electoral Translucencys most
gracious will that we your Most Supreme Selfs most faithful subjects
should entirely perish therefore we repeat our former most submissive
prayer once again with hot SIC sorrow of mind to HighesttheSame
and sob most submissively for that help which your Most Supreme Self
through most gracious mediation with the Duc de Richelieu with the
Reichs Army or wherever else might perhaps most graciously procure
for us Who in deepest longing thitherwards with the most deepest
devotion remain _ HeldenGeschichte_ iv 688691 NAMES

How many Saxons and Germans generallyalas how many men
universallycry towards celestial luminaries of the governing kind
with the most deepest devotion in their extreme need under their

4 DAUPHINESS AFTER ROSSBACH ExciseInspector Neitsche at Bebra near
Weissenfels Bebra is well ahead from Freiburg and the burnt Bridge
and a good twentyfive miles west of Weissenfels writes To the King of
Polands Majesty 9th NOVEMBER 1757

May it please your Royal Majesty and Electoral Translucency out of
your highest grace to take knowledge from the accompanying Registers
SUB SIGNO MARTIS sign unknown to readers here of the things which in
the name of this Township of Bebra the Burgermeister Johann Adam with
the Raths and others concerned have laid before the ExciseInspection
here As follows

It will be already well known to the ExciseInspection that on the
7th of November A C of the current year day before yesterday in
fact the French Army so handled this place as to have not only taken
from the inhabitants by open force all bread and articles of food but
likewise all clothes beds linens WASCHE and other portable goods
that it has broken split to pieces and emptied out all chests
boxes presses drawers has shot dead in the backyards and on the
thatchroofs all manner of featheredstock as hens geese pigeons
also carried forth with it all swine cow sheep and horse cattle laid
violent hands on the inhabitants clapped guns swords pistols to their
breast and threatened to kill them unless they showed and brought out
whatever goods they had or else has hunted them wholly out of their
houses shooting at them cutting sticking and at last driving them
away thereby to have the freer room to rob and plunder flung out hay
and other harveststock from the barns into the mud and dung and had
it trampled to ruin under the horses feet nay in fact has dealt with
this place in so unpermitted a way as even to the most hardhearted man
must seem compassionablePoor fellows CETERA DESUNT but that is
enough What can a Polish Majesty and Electoral Translucency do Here
too is a sorrowful howling to the Moon _HeldenGeschichte_ iv 692

 For a hundred miles round writes St Germain the Country is
plundered and harried as if fire from Heaven had fallen on it scarcely
have our plunderers and marauders left the houses standing I lead a
band of robbers of assassins fit for breaking on the wheel they would
turn tail at the first gunshot and are always ready to mutiny If the
Government LA COUR with its Pompadour presiding very unlikely for
such an enterprise cannot lay the knife to the root of all this we
may give up the notion of War St Germain after Rossbach and before
in Preuss UBI SUPRA

Such a pitch have French Armies sunk to When was there seen such
a Bellona as Dauphiness before Nay in fact she is the same
devilserving Army that Marechal de Saxe commanded with such
triumphMarechal de Saxe in better luck for opponents Army then in
a younger stage of its development Foaming then as sweet must as new
wine in the hands of a skilful vintner poisonous but brisk not run
as now to the vinegar state intolerable to all mortals She can now
announce from her camptheatres the reverse of the Roucoux
program Tomorrow Messieurs you are going to fight our Manager
foreseesyou will be beaten and we cannot say what or where the next
Piece will be Impious licentious highflaring efflorescence of all
the Vices is not to be redeemed by the one QuasiVirtue of readiness to
be shotsweet of that kind and sour of this are the same substance
if you only wait How kind was the Devil to his Saxe and flew away with
him in rosepink while it was still time




Chapter IXFRIEDRICH MARCHES FOR SILESIA

The fame of Friedrich is high enough again in the Gazetteer world
all people and the French themselves laughing at their grandiloquent
DauphinessBellona and writing epigrams on Soubise But Friedrichs
difficulties are still enormous One enemy coming with open mouth you
plunge in upon and ruin on this hand and it only gives you room
to attempt upon another bigger one on that Soubise he has finished
handsomely for this season but now he must try conclusions with Prince
Karl Quick towards Silesia after this glorious Victory which the
Gazetteers are celebrating

The news out of Silesia are ominously doubtful bad at the best Duke
Bevern once Winterfeld was gone had as we observed felt himself free
to act unchecked but also unsupported by counsel of the due heroism
and had acted unwisely Made direct for Silesia namely where are
mealmagazines and strong places Prince Karl they say was also
unwise took no thought beforehand or he might have gained marches
disputed rivers Bober Queiss with Bevern and as good as hindered him
from ever getting to Silesia So say critics Retzow and others perhaps
looking too fixedly on one side of the question Certain it is Bevern
marched in peace to Silesia found it by no means the better place it
had promised to be

Prince KarlDaun there as second but Karl now the dominant handwas
on the heels of Bevern march after march Prince Karl cut athwart him
by one cunning march in Liegnitz Country barring him from Schweidnitz
the chief stronghold of Silesia and to appearance from Breslau the
chief city too Bevern who did not want for soldiership when reduced
to his shifts now made a beautiful manoeuvre say the critics struck
out leftwards namely and crossed the Oder as if making for Glogau
quite beyond Prince Karls sphere of possibilitybut turned to right
not to left when across and got in upon Breslau from the other or
east side of the River Cunning manoeuvre if you will and followed by
cunning manoeuvres but the result is Prince Karl has got Schweidnitz
to rear stands between Breslau and it can besiege Schweidnitz when
he likes and no relief to it possible that will not cost a battle A
battle thinks Friedrich is what Bevern ought to have tried at first a
wellfought battle might have settled everything and there was no
other good likelihood in such an expedition but now by detaching
reinforcements to this garrison and that he has weakened himself
beyond right power of fighting _OEuvres de Frederic_ iv 141
159 Schweidnitz is liable to siege Breslau with its poor walls
and multitudinous population can stand no siege worth mentioning the
Silesian strong places not to speak of mealmagazines are like to go
a bad road Quite dominant this Prince Karl placarding and
proclaiming in all places according to the new Imperial Patent In _

Treaties by Prussian Majestys attack on us We c c 21st Sept
1757 That Silesia is her Imperial Majestys again Which seems to be
fast becoming the factunless contradicted better Quick

Bevern has now October 1st no manoeuvre left but to draw out of
Breslau post himself on the southern side of it in a safe angle there
marshy Lohe in front broad Oder to rear Breslau at his righthand with
bread and there intrenching himself by the best methods wait slowly
in a sitting posture events which are extensively on the gallop at
present One fancies Had Winterfeld been still there It is as brave an
Army 30000 or more as ever wore steel Surely something could have
been done with itsomething better than sit watching the events on
full gallop all round Bevern was a loyal considerably skilful and
valiant man in the Battle of Lobositz and elsewhere we have seen him
brave as a lion but perhaps in the other kind of bravery wanted here
heWell his case was horribly difficult full of intricacy And he
sat no doubt in a very wretched state consulting the oracles with
events which are themselves oracular going at such a pace

Schweidnitz was besieged October 26th Nadasti with 20000 was set
to do it Prince Karl with 60000 ready to protect him Prince Bevern
asking the oracleswhat a bit of news for Friedrich breaking suddenly
the effulgency of Rossbach with a bar of ominous black Friedrich
still in the thick of pure Saxon business makes instant arrangement for
Silesia as well Prince Henri with such and such corps to maintain the
Saale and guard Saxony Marshal Keith with such and such to step over
into Bohemia and raise contributions at least and tread on the tail of
the big Silesian snake all this Friedrich settles within a week takes
certain corps of his own effective about 13000 and on November 13th
marches from Leipzig Round by Torgau by Muhlberg Grossenhayn by
Bautzen Weissenberg across the Queiss across the Bober and so with
long marches strides continually forward all hearts willing and all
limbs though in this sad winter weather towards relief of Schweidnitz

At Grossenhayn fifth day of the march Friedrich learns that
Schweidnitz is gone November 12th14th Schweidnitz went by
capitulation contrary to everybodys hope or fear certainly a
very short defence for such a fortress Fault of the Commandant was
everybodys first thought Not probably the best of Commandants said
others gradually but his garrison had Saxons in itone day 180 of
them in a lump threw down their arms in the trenches and went over to
the Enemy Owing to whatsoever the place is gone Such towers such
curtains starramparts such an opulence of cannons stores munitions
a 30000 pounds of hard cash one item All is gone after a fortnights
siege What a piece of news as heard by Friedrich coming at his utmost
towards the scene itself As seen by Bevern too in his questioning
mood it was an event of very oracular nature

On Monday 14th Schweidnitz fell Karl with Nadasti reunited to him
was now 80000 odd and lost no time On Tuesday next NOVEMBER 22d
1757 at three in the morning long hours before daybreak Karl with
his 60000 all learnedly arranged comes rolling over upon hapless
Bevern with no end of cannonading and storm of war BATTLE OF
BRESLAU they call it ruinous to Bevern Of which we shall attempt no
description except to say that Karl had five bridges on the Lohe
came across the Lohe by five Bridges and that Bevern stood to his arms
steady as the rocks to prevent his getting over and to entertain
him when over that there were five principal attacks renewed and
rerenewed as long as needful with torrents of shot of death and
tumult over six or eight miles of country for the space of fifteen
hours Battle comparable only to Malplaquet said the Austrians such a
hurricane of artillery strongly intrenched enemy and loud doomsday of
war Did not end till nine at night Austrians victorious more or
less in four of their attacks or separate enterprises that is to say
masters of the Lohe and of the outmost Prussian villages and posts in
front of the Prussian centre and right wing victorious in that northern
partbut plainly unvictorious in the southeast or Prussian left
wingfarthest off from Breslau and under Ziethens commandwhere
they were driven across the Lohe again and lost prisoners and cannons
or a cannon In Seyfarth Three Accounts _ Beylagan_ ii 198 221
234 et seq

Some of Beverns people grounding on this latter circumstance and that
they still held the Battlefield or most part of it wrote themselves
victoriousthough in a dim brief manner as if conscious of the
contrary Which indeed was the fact At the council of war which he
summoned that evening there were proposals of nightattack and other
fierce measures but Bevern rejecting the plan for a night attack on
the Austrian camp as too dubious did in the dark hours through the
silent streets of Breslau withdraw himself across the Oder instead
leaving 80 cannon and 5000 killed and wounded an evidently beaten man
and Army And indeed did straightway disappear personally altogether as
no longer equal to events Rode out namely to reconnoitre in the gray
of his second sad morning on this new Bank of the Oder saw little
except gray mist but rode into a Croat outpost only one poor groom
attending him and was there made prisonerintentionally thought
mankind intentionally thinks Friedrich who was very angry with the
poor man Preuss ii 102 More exact in Kutzen DER TAG VON LEUTHEN

The poor man was carried to Vienna if readers care to know but being a
near Cousin there secondcousin no less to the late EmpressMother
was by the high nowreigning EmpressQueen received in a charmingly
gracious manner and sent home again without ransom To Stettin
beckoned Friedrich sternly from the distance and would not see him at
all To Stettin I say your official post in time of peace Command me
the invalid Garrison there you are fit for nothing betterI will
add one other thing which unhappily will seem strange to readers that
there came no whisper of complaint from Bevern mere silence and loyal
industry with his poor means from Bevern and that he proved heroically
useful in Stettin two years hence against the Swedes against the
Russians in the SiegeofColberg time and gained Friedrichs favor
again with other good results Which I observe was a common method with
Prussian Generals and soldiers when unjustly or justly they fell into
trouble of this kind and a much better one than that of complaining in
the Newspapers and demanding Commissions of Inquiry presided over by
Chaos and the FourthEstate now is

Bevern being with the Croats the Prussian Army falls to General Kyau
as next in rank who directly in the teeth of fierce orders that are
speeding hither for Bevern and him marches away leaving Breslau to its
fate and making towards Glogau as the one sure point in this wreck of
things And Prince Karl that same day goes upon Breslau which is in
no case to resist and be bombarded so that poor old General Lestwitz
the Prussian Commandantalways thought to be a valiant old gentleman
but who had been wounded in the late Action and was blamably
discouragedtook the terms offered and surrendered without firing a
gun Garrison and he to march out in Free Withdrawal these are the
terms Garrison was 4000 and odd mostly Silesian recruits but
there marched hardly 500 out with poor Lestwitz the Silesian
recruitspersuaded by conceivable methods that they were to be
prisoners of war and that in short Austria was now come to be King
again and might make inquiry into mens conductfound it safer to
take service with Austria to vanish into holes in Breslau or where they
could and for instance one regiment or battalion let us hide the
name of it on marching through the Gate consisted only of nine
chief officers and four men Muller SCHLACHT BEI LEUTHEN Berlin

Malplaquet were we beaten by them Hnhand snort in the Austrian
messrooms and snap their fingers at Friedrich and his coming

It was at Gorlitz scene of poor Winterfelds death that Friedrich
on November 23d the tenth day of his march first got rumor of
the Breslau Malplaquet endless cannonading heard thereabouts all
yesterday said rumor from the eastmore and more steadily as
Friedrich hastened forwardand that it was a victory for Bevern
Till at Naumburg on the Queiss he gets the actual tidings Bevern
gone to the Croats Breslau going Kyau marching vague and what kind of
victory it was

Ever from Grossenhayn onwards there had been message on message more
and more rigorous precise and indignant Do this do that your
Dilection shall answer it with your headnot one message of which
reached his Dilection till Dilection and Fate such the gallop of
events had done the contrary and now Dilection and his head have made
a finish of it No answers Friedrich to himself not till we are all
finishedand pushes on he too like a kind of Fate What does or
can he mean then say the Austrians with scornful astonishment and
think his head must be turning Will he beat us out of Silesia with
his Potsdam GuardParade then POTSDAMSCHE WACHTPARADEso they
denominate his small Army and are very mirthful in their messrooms I
will attack them if they stood on the Zobtenberg if they stood on the
steeples of Breslau said Friedrich and tramped diligently forward
Day after day as the real tidings arrive his outlook in Silesia is
becoming darker and darker a sternly dark march this altogether Prince
Karl has thrown a garrison into Liegnitz on Friedrichs road Prince
Karl lies encamped with Breslau at his back has above 80000 when fully
gathered and reigns supreme in those parts Darker march there seldom
was all black save a light that burns in one heart refusing to be
quenched till death

shall be general of the Bevern wreck shall bring it round by Glogau
and rendezvous with Friedrich at a place and dayParchwitz 2d of
December comingand be steady my old Ziethen Friedrich brushes past
the Liegnitz Garrison leaves Liegnitz and it a trifle to the right
arrives at Parchwitz November 28th and there rests or at least his
weary troops do till Ziethen come up the King not very restful with
so many things to prearrange a life or death crisis now nigh Well it
is but death and death has been fronted before now We who are after
the event on the safe sunny side of it can form small image of the
horrors and the inward dubieties to him who is passing through itand
how Hope is needed to shine heroically eternal in some hearts Fire of
Hope that does not issue in mere blazings mad audacities and chaotic
despair but advances with its eyes open measuredly counting its
steps to the wrestlingplacethis is a godlike thing much available
to mankind in all the battles they have battles with steel or of
whatever sort

Friedrich at Parchwitz assembled his Captains and spoke to them it
was the night after Ziethen came in night of December 3d 1757 and
Ziethen no doubt was there for it is an authentic meeting this at
Parchwitz and the words were taken down


FRIEDRICHS SPEECH TO HIS GENERALS Parchwitz 3d December 1757 From
RETZOW i 240242 slightly abridged

It is not unknown to you MEINE HERREN what disasters have befallen
here while we were busy with the French and Reichs Army Schweidnitz is
gone Duke of Bevern beaten Breslau gone and all our warstores there
good part of Silesia gone and in fact my embarrassments would be
at the insuperable pitch had not I boundless trust in you and your
qualities which have been so often manifested as soldiers and sons of
your Country Hardly one among you but has distinguished himself by some
nobly memorable action all these services to the State and me I know
well and will never forget

I flatter myself therefore that in this case too nothing will be
wanting which the State has a right to expect of your valor The hour is
at hand I should think I had done nothing if I left the Austrians in
possession of Silesia Let me apprise you then I intend in spite of
the Rules of Art to attack Prince Karls Army which is nearly thrice
our strength wherever I find it The question is not of his numbers or
the strength of his position all this by courage by the skill of our
methods we will try to make good This step I must risk or everything
is lost We must beat the enemy or perish all of us before his
batteries So I read the case so I will act in it

Make this my determination known to all Officers of the Army prepare
the men for what work is now to ensue and say that I hold myself
entitled to demand exact fulfilment of orders For you when I reflect
that you are Prussians can I think that you will act unworthily But if
there should be one or another who dreads to share all dangers with
me hecontinued his Majesty with an interrogative look and then
pausing for answercan have his Discharge this evening and shall not
suffer the least reproach from meModest strong bass murmur meaning
No by the Eternal if you looked into the eyes and faces of the
group Never will Retzow Junior forget that scene and how effulgently
eloquent the veteran physiognomies were

Hah I knew it said the King with his most radiant smile none
of you would desert me I depend on your help then and on victory
as sureThe speech winds up with a specific passage The Cavalry
regiment that does not on the instant on order given dash full plunge
into the enemy I will directly after the Battle unhorse and make
it a Garrison regiment The Infantry battalion which meet with what
it may shows the least sign of hesitating loses its colors and its
sabres and I cut the trimmings from its uniform Now goodnight
Gentlemen shortly we have either beaten the Enemy or we never see one
another again

An excellent temper in this Army a rough vein of heroism in it steady
to the deathand plenty of hope in it too hope in Vater Fritz Never
mind the soldiers used to say in John Duke of Marlboroughs time
Corporal John will get us through itThat same evening Friedrich
rode into the Camp where the regiments he had were now all gathered
out of their cantonments to march on the morrow First regiment he came
upon was the LifeGuard Cuirassiers the men in their accustomed way
gave him goodevening which he cheerily returned Some of the more
veteran sort asked ruggedly confidential as well as loyal What is
thy news then so late Good news children KINDER tomorrow
you will beat the Austrians tightly That we will by answered
theyBut think only where they stand yonder and how they have
intrenched themselves said Friedrich And if they had the Devil in
front and all round them we will knock them out only thou lead us
onWell I will see what you can do now lay you down and sleep
sound and good sleep to you Goodnight Fritz answer all Muller
p 21 from Kaltenhorn of whom INFRA Preuss c c as Fritz ambles
on to the next regiment to which as to every one he will have some
word

Was it the famous Pommern regiment this that he next spoke towho
answered Loudons summons to them once as shall be noticed by and by
in a way ineffable though unforgettable Manteuffel of Foot yes no
other Archenholtz ii 61 and Kutzen p 35 They have their own
opinion of their capacities against an enemy and do not want for a
good conceit of themselves Well children how think you it will be
tomorrow They are twice as strong as we Never thou mind that
there are no Pommerners among them thou knowest what the Pommerners can
doFRIEDRICH Yea truly that do I otherwise I durst not risk the
battle Now good sleep to you tomorrow then we shall either have
beaten the Enemy or else be all dead Yea answered the whole
regiment dead or else the Enemy beaten and so went to deep sleep
preface to a deeper for many of themas beseems brave men In this
world it much beseems the brave man uncertain about so many things to
be certain of himself for one thing

These snatches of Camp Dialogue much more the Speech preserved to us
by Retzow Junior appear to be true though as to the dates the
circumstances there has been debating Kutzen pp 175181 Other
Anecdotes dubious or more still float about in quantityof which
let us give only one that of the Deserter which has merit as a myth
What made thee desert then Hm alas your Majesty we were got so
down in the world and had such a time of itWell try it one day
more and if we cannot mend matters thou and I will both desert

A learned Doctor one of the most recent on these matters is astonished
why the Histories of Friedrich should be such dreary reading and
Friedrich himself so prosaic barren an object and lays the blame
upon the Age insensible to real greatness led away by claptrap
Napoleonisms regardless of expense Upon which Smelfungus takes him up
with a twitch

To my sad mind Herr Doctor it seems ascribable rather to the
Dryasdust of these Ages especially to the Prussian Dryasdust sitting
comfortable in his Academies waving sublimely his long ears as he
tramples human Heroisms into unintelligible pipeclay and dreary
continents of sand and cinders with the Doctors all applauding

Had the sacred Poet or man of real Human Genius been at his work for
the thousand years last past instead of idly fiddling far away from
his workwhich surely is definable as being very mainly That of
INTERPRETING human Heroisms of painfully extricating and extorting
from the circumambient chaos of muddy babble rumor and mendacity some
not inconceivable human and divine Image of them more and more clear
complete and credible for mankind poor mankind dumbly looking up to him
for guidance as to what it shall think of God and of Men in this Scene
of ThingsI calculate we should by this time have had a different
Friedrich of it O Heavens a different world of it in so many
respects

My esteemed Herr Doctor it is too painful a subject Godlike fabulous
Achilles and the old Greek Kings of men one perceives after study
to be dim enough Grazier Sovereigns living among infinite dung till
their sacred Poet extricated them And our UNsacred alldesecrating
DryasdustHerr Doctor I must say it fills me with despair Authentic
human Heroisms not fabulous a whit but true to the bone and by all
appearance very much nobler than those of godlike Achilles and pious
AEneas ever could have beenleft in this manner trodden under foot of
man and beast man and beast alike insensible that there is anything
but common mud under foot and grateful to anybody that will assure them
there is nothing Oh Doctor oh Doctor And the results of itYou
need not go exclusively to France to look at them They are too
visible in the socalled Social Hierarchies and sublime gilt
Doggeries sltcred and secular of all Modern Countries Let us be
silent my friend

Prussian Dryasdust he says elsewhere does make a terrible job of
it especially when he attempts to weep through his pipeclay or rise
with his long ears into the moral sublime As to the German People
I find that they dimly have not wanted sensibility to Friedrich that
their multitudes of Anecdotes still circulating among them in print and
VIVA VOCE are proof of this Thereby they have at least made a MYTH of
Friedrichs History and given some rhythmus life and cheerful human
substantiality to his work and him Accept these Anecdotes as the Epic
THEY could not write of him but were longing to hear from somebody who
could Who has not yet appeared among mankind nor will for some time
Alas my friend on piercing through the bewildering nimbus of babble
malignity mendacity which veils sevenfold the Face of Friedrich
from us and getting to see some glimpses of the Face itself one is
sorrowfully struck dumb once more What a suicidal set of creatures
commanding as with one voice That there shall be no Heroism more among
them that all shall be Doggery and Commonplace henceforth ACH
MEIN LIEBER SULZER you dont know that damned broodWell well
Solomons Temple the Moslems say had to be built under the chirping
of ten thousand Sparrows Ten thousand of them committee of the whole
house unanimously of the opposite viewand could not quite hinder it
That too is something

More to our immediate purpose is this other thing That the Austrians
have been in Council of War and on deliberation have decided to
come out of their defences to quit their strong Camp which lies so
eligibly ahead of Breslau and arear of Lissa and of Schweidnitz Water
yonder to cross Schweidnitz Water leave Lissa behind them and meet
this offensively aggressive Friedrich in pitched fight Several had
voted No why stirDaun especially and others with emphasis No
need of fighting at all said Daun we can defend Schweidnitz Water
ruin him before he ever get across Defend Be assaulted by an Army
like his urges Lucchesi the other Chief General It is totally
unworthy of us We have gained the game all the honors ours let us
have done with it Give him battle since he fortunately wishes it we
finish him and gloriously finish the War too So argued Lucchesi with
vivacity persistencyto his own ill luck but evidently with approval
from Prince Karl Everybody sees this is the way to Prince Karls favor
at present Have not I reconquered Silesia thinks Prince Karl to
himself and beams applause on the high course not the low prudent one
Kutzen pp 4548 In a word the Austrians decide on stepping out to
meet Friedrich in open battle it was the first time they ever did so
and it was likewise the last

Sunday December 4th at four in the morning Friedrich has marched
from Parchwitz straight towards the Austrian Camp Muller p 26
he hears one can fancy with what pleasure that the Austrians are
advancing towards him and will not need to be forced in their strong
position His march is in four columns Friedrich in the vanguard
quarters to be Neumarkt a little Town about fourteen miles off Within
some miles of Neumarkt early in the afternoon he learns that there are
a thousand Croats in the place the Austrian Bakery at work there and
engineer people marking out an Austrian Camp On the Height beyond
Neumarkt that will be thinks Friedrich for he knows this ground
having often done reviews here to Breslau all the way on both hands
not a rood of it but is familiar to him Which was a singular advantage
say the critics and a point the Austrian Council of War should have
taken more thought of

Friedrich before entering Neumarkt sends a regiment to ride quietly
round it on both sides and to seize that Height he knows of Height
once seized or ready for seizing he bursts the barrier of Neumarkt
dashes in upon the thousand Croats flings out the Croats in extreme
hurry musketry and sabre acting on them they find their Height beset
their retreat cut off and that they must vanish Of the 1000 Croats
569 were taken prisoners and 120 slain in this unexpected sweeping
out of Neumarkt Better still in Neumarkt is found the Austrian Bakery
set up and in full workdelivers you 80000 breadrations hotandhot
which little expected to go such a road On the Height the Austrian
stakes and engineertools were found sticking in the ground so hasty
had the flight been

How Prince Karl came to expose his Bakery his staff of life so far
ahead of him Prince Karl it is clear was a little puffed up with high
thoughts at this time The capture of Schweidnitz the late Malplaquet
poorish AntiBevern Malplaquet capture of Breslau and the low and
lost condition of Friedrichs Silesian affairs had more or less turned
everybodys headeverybodys except Feldmarschall Dauns aloneand
witty messtables we already said were in the daily habit of mocking
at Friedrichs march towards them with aggressive views and called his
insignificant little Army the Potsdam GuardParade Cogniazzo ii
417422 That was the common triumphant humor naturally shared in by
Prince Karl the ready way to flatter him being to sing in that tune
Nobody otherwise can explain and nobody in any wise can justify Prince
Karls ignorance of Friedrichs advance his almost voluntary losing of
his staffoflife in that manner

Prince Karls soldiers have each in the cold form three days
provision in their haversacks they have come across the Weistritz River
more commonly called Schweidnitz Water which was also the height of
contemptuous imprudence and lie encamped this nightin long line
not illchosen once the River IS behindperpendicular to Friedrichs
march some ten miles ahead of him Since crossing they had learned
with surprise How their Bakery and Croats had been snapt up that
Friedrich was not at a distance but nearand that arrangements could
not be made too soon Their position intersects the Great Road at right
angles as we hint and has villages swamps woody knolls especially
on each wing good defences Their right wing leans on Nypern and its
impassable peatbogs a Village two or three miles north from the Great
Road their centre is close behind another Village called Leuthen about
as far south from it length of their bivouac is about five miles which
will become six or so had Nadasti once taken post who is to form the
left wing and go down as far as Sagschutz southward of Leuthen Seven
battalions are in this Village of Leuthen eight in Nypern all the
Villages secured woods scraggy abatis redoubts not forgotten their
cannon are numerous though of light calibre Friedrich has at least
71 heavy pieces and 10 of them are formidably heavybrought from
the walls of Glogau with terrible labor to Ziethen but with excellent
effect on this occasion and henceforth They got the name of Boomers
Bellowers DIE BRUMMER those Ten Friedrich was in great straits
about artillery and Retzow Senior recommended this hauling up of the
Ten Bellowers which became celebrated in the years coming And now we
are on the Battleground and must look into the Battle itself if we
can




Chapter XBATTLE OF LEUTHEN

From Neumarkt on Monday long before day the Prussians all but a
small party left there to guard the Bakery and Army Properties are out
again in four columns towards what may lie ahead Friedrich as usual
in such cases for obvious reasons rides with the vanguard To Borne
the first Village on the Highway is some seven or eight miles The air
is damp the dim incipiences of dawn struggling among haze a little
way on this side Borne we come on ranks of cavalry drawn across the
Highway stretching right and left into the dim void Austrian Army
this then Push up to it see what it is at least

It proves to be poor General Nostitz with his three Saxon regiments
of dragoons famous since Kolinday and a couple of Hussar regiments
standing here as outpostwho ought to have been more alert but they
could not see through the dark and so instead of catching are
caught The Prussians fall upon them front and flank tumble them into
immediate wreck drive the whole outpost at full gallop home through
Borne upon Nypern and the right wingwithout news except of this
symbolical sort Saxon regiments are quite ruined 540 of them
prisoners poor Nostitz himself not prisoner but wounded to death
Died in Breslau the twelfth day after Seyfarth ii 362 and the
ground clear in this quarter

Friedrich on the farther side of Borne calls halt till the main body
arrive rides forward himself and staff to the highest of a range or
suite of knolls some furlongs ahead sees there in full view far
and wide the Austrians drawn up before him From Nypern to Sagschuitz
yonder miles in length and so distinct while the light mended and the
hazes faded that you could have counted them through your glasses
man by man A highly interesting sight to Friedrich who continues
there in the profoundest study and calls up some horse regiments of the
vanguard to maintain this Height and the range of Heights running south
from it And there I think the King is mainly to be found looking now
at the Austrians now at his own people for some three hours to come
His plan of Battle is soon clear to him Nypern with its bogs and
scrags on the Austrian right wing is tortuous impossible ground as he
well remembers no good prospect for us there better ground for us on
their left yonder at Leuthen even at Sagschutz farther south whither
they are stretching themselves Attempt their left wing try our
Oblique Order upon that with all the skill that is in us perhaps
we can do it rightly this time and prosper accordingly That is
Friedrichs plan of action The four columns once got to Borne
shall fall into two turn to the right and go southward ever
southwardthey are to become our two Lines of Battle were they once
got to the right point southward Well opposite Sagschutz that will be
the point for facing to left and marching upin Oblique Order with
the utmost faculty they have

The Oblique Order SCHRAGE STELLUNG let the hasty reader pause to
understand is an old plan practised by Epaminondas and revived by
Friedrichwho has tried it in almost all his Battles more or less
from Hohenfriedberg forward to Prag Kolin Rossbach but never could
in all points get it rightly done till now at Leuthen in the highest
time of need It is a particular manoeuvre says Archenholtz rather
sergeantwise which indeed other troops are now 1793 in the habit of
imitating but which up to this present time none but Prussian troops
can execute with the precision and velocity indispensable to it You
divide your line into many pieces you can push these forward stairwise
so that they shall halt close to one another obliquely to either
hand and so on a minimum of ground bring your mass of men to the
required point at the required angle Friedrich invented this mode
of getting into position by its close ranking by its depth and the
manner of movement used it had some resemblance to the Macedonian
Phalanxchiefly in the latter point I should guess for when arrived
at its place it is no deeper than common Forming itself in this way
a mass of troops takes up in proportion very little ground and it
shows in the distance by reason of the mixed uniforms and standards a
totally chaotic mass of men heaped on one another going in rapid
mazes this way and that But it needs only that the Commander lift
his finger instantly this living coil of knotted intricacies develops
itself in perfect order and with a speed like that of mountain rivers
when the ice breaksis upon its Enemy Archenholtz i 209

Your Enemy is ranked as here in long line three or two to one You
march towards him but keep him uncertain as to how you will attack
then do on a sudden march up not parallel to him but oblique at an
angle of 45 degreesswift vehement in overpowering numbers on the
wing you have chosen Roll that wing together ruined in upon its own
line you may roll the whole five miles of line into disorder and ruin
and always be in overpowering number at the point of dispute Provided
only you are swift enough about it sharp enough But extraordinary
swiftness sharpness precision is the indispensable conditionby no
means try it otherwise none but Prussians drilled by an Old Dessauer
capable of doing it This is the SCHRAGE ORDNUNG about which there has
been such commentating and controversying among military people whether
Friedrich invented it whether Caesar did it how Epaminondas how
Alexander at Arbela howWhich shall not in the least concern us on
this occasion

The four columns rustled themselves into two and turned southward on
the two sides of Bornesouthward henceforth for about two hours as
if straight towards the Magic Mountain the Zobtenberg far off which
is conspicuous over all that region Their steadiness their swiftness
and exactitude were unsurpassable It was a beautiful sight says
Tempelhof an eyewitness The heads of the columns were constantly on
the same level and at the distance necessary for forming all flowed
on exact as if in a review And you could read in the eyes of our brave
troops the noble temper they were in Tempelhof i 288 287 I know
not at what point of their course or for how long but it was from
the column nearest him which is to be first line that the King heard
borne on the winds amid their fieldmusic as they marched there the
sound of Psalmsmanyvoiced melody of a Church Hymn well known to
him which had broken out band accompanying among those otherwise
silent men The fact is very certain very strange to me details not
very precise except that here as specimen is a verse of their Hymn

 Grant that with zeal and skill this day I do
 What me to do behooves what thou commandst me to
 Grant that I do it sharp at point of moment fit
 And when I do it grant me good success in it

 Gieb dass ich thu mit Fleiss was mir zu thun gebuhret
 Wozu mich dein Befehl in meinem Stande fuhret
 Gieb dass ichs thue bald zu der Zeit da ichs soll
 Und wenn ichs thu so gieb dass es gerathe wohl

HYMNBOOK of Porst Prussian SternholdandHopkins p 689 cited
in Preuss ii 107

One has heard the voice of waters one has paused in the mountains at
the voice of faroff Covenanter psalms but a voice like this breaking
the commanded silences one has not heard Shall we order that to
cease your Majesty By no means said the King whose hard heart
seems to have been touched by it as might well be Indeed there is in
him in those grim days a tone as of trust in the Eternal as of real
religious piety and faith scarcely noticeable elsewhere in his History
His religion and he had in withered forms a good deal of it if we
will look well being almost always in a strictly voiceless statenay
ultravoiceless or voiced the wrong way as is too well known By
no means answered he and a moment after said to some one Ziethen
probably With men like these dont you think I shall have victory
this day

The loss of their Saxon Forepost proved more important to the Austrians
than it seemednot computable in prisoners or killed and wounded The
Height named ScheubergBorne Rise so we might call it which has
got its Pillar of memorial since with gilt Victory atop Not till
1854 Kutzen pp 194 195where Friedrich now is and where
the Austrians are not is at once a screen and a point of vision to
Friedrich By loss of their Nostitz Forepost they had lost view of
Friedrich and never could recover view of him could not for hours
learn distinctly what he was about and when he did come in sight again
it was in a most unexpected place On the farther side of Borne edge of
the big expanse of open country there Friedrich has halted ridden with
his adjutants to the top of the Scheuberg ShyHILL as the Books
call it though it is more properly a blunt Knoll or Risethe
nearest of a Chain of Knolls or swells in the ground which runs from
north to south on that part

Except the Zobtenberg rising blue and massive on the southern horizon
famous mythologic Mountain reminding you of an ARTHURS SEAT in shape
too only bigger and solitary this Country for many miles round
has nothing that could be called a Hill it is definable as a bare
widewaving champaign with slight bumps on it or slow heavings and
sinkings Country mostly under culture though it is of sandy quality
one or two sluggish brooks in it and reedy meres or mires drained in
our day It is dotted with Hamlets of the usual kind and has patches
of scraggy fir Your horizon even where bare is limited owing to the
wavy heavings of the ground windmills and churchbelfries are your only
resource and even these from about Leuthen and the Austrian position
leave the Borne quarter mostly invisible to you Leuthen Belfry the
same which may have stood a hundred years before this Battle ends in
a small tileroof open only at the gablesLeuthen Belfry says a
recent Tourist is of small resource for a view To south you can see
some distance Sagschutz Lobetintz and other Hamlets amid scraggy
firpatches and meadows once miry pools but to north you are soon
shut in by a swell or slow rise with two windmills upon it important
to readers at present and to eastward Breslau side and Lissa side
or to westward Friedrichs side one has no view except of the old
warped rafters and their old mouldy tiles within few inches or if
by audacious efforts at each end to the risk of your neck you get a
transient peep it is stopt far short of Borne by the slow irregular
heavings with or without fir about them Tourists Note PENES ME

In short Friedrich keeps possession of that Borne ridge of Knolls
escorted by Cavalry in good numbers twinkling about in an enigmatic
wayPrussian right wing yonder think the Austrianswhitherward
or what can they meanand keeps his own columns and the Austrian
lines in view himself and his movements invisible or worse to the
Austrian Generals from any spyglass or conjecture they can employ

The Austrian Generals are in windmills on churchbelfries here there
diligently scanning the abstruse phenomenon of which so little can
be seen Daun who had always been against this adventure thinks it
probable the vanished Prussians are retiring southward for Bohemia and
our Magazines probably These good people are smuggling off DIE GUTEN
LEUTE PASCHEN AB said he let them go in peace Muller p 36
Daun that morning in his reconnoitrings had asked of a peasant What
is that then meaning the top of a Villagesteeple in the distance
but thought by the peasant to be meaning something nearer hand That
is the Hill our King chases the Austrians over when he is reviewing
here Which Daun reported at headquarters with a grin Nicolai
_Anekdoten_ iv 34

Lucchesi on the other hand scanning those Borne Hills and the cavalry
of Friedrichs escort twinkling hither and thither on them becomes
convinced to a moral certainty That yonder is the Prussian Vanguard
probable extremity of left wing and that he Lucchesi here at Nypern
is to be attacked Attacked you said one Montazet French Agent or
Emissary here unless they were snipes it is impossible But Lucchesi
saw it too well

He sends to say that such is the evident fact and that he Lucchesi is
not equal to it but must have large reinforcement of Horse to his right
wing Tush answer Prince Karl and Daun and return only argument
verbal consolation to distressed Lucchesi Lucchesi sends a second
message more passionately pressing to the like effect also with the
like return Upon which he sends a third message quite passionate If
Cavalry do not come I will not be responsible for the issue And now
Daun does collect the required reinforcement all the reserve of Horse
and a great many from the left wingand Daun himself heading them
goes off at a swift trot to look into Lucchesi and his distresses
three or four miles to right five or six from where the danger lies
Now is Friedrichs golden moment

Wending always south on their western or invisible side of those
Knolls Friedrichs people have got to about the level or LATITUDE as
we might call it of Nadastis left To Radaxdorf namely to Lobetintz
or still farther south and perhaps a mile to west of Nadasti Friedrich
has mounted to Lobetintz Windmill and judges that the time is come
Daun and Cavalry once got to support their right wing and our south
latitude being now sufficient Friedrich swift as Prussian manoeuvring
can do it falls with all his strength upon their left wing Forms in
oblique orderhorse foot artillery all perfect in their paces
and comes streaming over the Knolls at Sagschutz suddenly like a
firedeluge on Nadasti who had charge there and was expecting no such
adventure How Friedrich did the forming in oblique order was at that
time a mystery known only to Friedrich and his Prussians but soldiers
of all countries gathering the secret from him now understand it and
can learnedly explain it to such as are curious Will readers take a
touch more of the DRILLSERGEANT

You go stairwise EN ECHELON says he first battalion starts
second stands immovable till the first have done fifty steps at the
fiftyfirst second battalion also steps along third waiting for ITS
fiftyfirst step First battalion rightmost battalion or leftmost
as the case may be rightmost in this Leuthen case doing fifty steps
before the next stirs and each battalion in succession punctually doing
the same march along on these termsor halt at either end while you
advance at the otherit is evident you will swing yourself out of the
parallel position into any degree of obliquity And furthermore
merely by halting and facing half round at the due intervals you
shove yourself to right or to left as required always to right in this
Leuthen case and soprovided you CAN march as a pair of compasses
wouldyou will in the given number of minutes impinge upon your
Enemys extremity at the required angle and overlap him to the required
length whereupon At him in flank in front and rear and see if he
can stand it A beautiful manoeuvre says Captain Archenholtz devised
by Friedrich by Friedrich inheriting Epaminondas and the Old Dessauer
and which perhaps only Friedrichs men to this day could do with the
requisite perfection

Nadasti a skilful WarCaptain especially with Horse was beautifully
posted about Sagschutz his extreme left folded up EN POTENCE there
elbow of it at Sagschutz forearm of it running to Gohlau eastward
POTENCE ending in firwood Knolls with Croat musketeers in ditches
ponds difficult ground especially towards Gohlau He has a strong
battery 14 pieces on the Height to rear of him at the angle or elbow
of his POTENCE strong abatis well manned in front to rightwards upon
this and upon the Croats in the firwood the Prussians intend their
attack General Wedell is there Prince Moritz as chief with six
battalions and their batteries battery of 10 Brummers and another
Ziethen also and Horse coming on in swift fireflood and at an
angle of fortyfive degrees Most unexpected strange to behold From
southwest yonder about one oclock of the day

Nadasti though astonished at the Prussian firedeluge stands to his
arms makes in front vigorous defence and even takes in some sort
the initiativethat is dashes out his Cavalry on Ziethen before
Ziethen has charged Ziethens Horse who are rightmost of the
Prussians and are bare to the rightground offering no bush no brook
there though Ziethen foreseeing such defect has a clump of infantry
near by to mend itreel back under this first shock coming downhill
upon them and would have fared badly had not the clump of infantry
instantly opened fire on the Nadasti visitors and poured it in such
floods upon them that they in their turn had to reel back Back they
well out of rangeand leave Ziethen free for a counterattack shortly
on easier terms which was successful to him For during that first
tussle of his the Prussian Infantry to left of Ziethen has attacked
the Sagschutz Firwood clears that of Croats attacks Nadastis line
breaks it their Brummer battery potently assisting and the rage
of Wedell and everybody being extreme So that in spite of the fine
ground Nadasti is in a bad way on the extreme left or outmost point
of his POTENCE or tactical KNEE Round the kneepan or angle of his
POTENCE where is the abatis he fares still worse Abatis beswept by
those ten Brummers and other Batteries till bullet and bayonet can act
on it speedily gives way They were mere Wurtembergers these and
could not stand cried the Austrians apologetically at a great rate
afterwards as if anybody could well have stood

Indisputably the Wurtembergers and the abatis are gone and the
Brandenburgers storming after them storm Nadastis interior battery of
14 pieces and Nadastis affairs are rapidly getting desperate in this
quarter Figure Prince Karls scouts galloping madly to recall that
Daun Cavalry Austrian Battalions plenty of them rush down to help
Nadasti but they are met by the crowding fugitives the chasing
Prussians are themselves thrown into disorder and can do no good
whatever They arrive on the ground flurried blown have not the
least time to take breath and order the fewest of them ever got fairly
ranked none of them ever stood above one push all goes rolling wildly
back upon the centre about Leuthen Chaos come on usand all for mere
lack of time could Nadasti but once stretch out one minute into twenty
But he cannot Nadasti does not himself lose head skilfully covers the
retreat trying to rally once and again Not for the first few furlongs
till the ditches till the firwood quagmires are all done could
Ziethen now on the open ground fairly hew in take whole battalions
prisoners drive the crowd in an altogether stormy manner and wholly
confound the matter in this part

Prince Karl his messengers flying madly has struggled as man seldom
did to put himself in some posture about Leuthen to get up some
defences there Leuthen itself the churchyard of it especially is on
the defensive Men are bringing cannon to the windmills to the
swelling ground on the north side of Leuthen they dig ditches build
batteriescould they but make Time halt and Friedrich with him for
one quarter of an hour But they cannot By the extreme of diligence
the Austrians have in some measure swung themselves into a new position
or imperfect Line round Leuthen as a centreLucchesi voluntarily
or by order swinging southwards on the one hand Nadasti swinging
northwards by compulsionnew Line at an angle say of 75 degrees to
the old one And here for an hour more there was stiff fighting
the stiffest of the dayof which take one direct glimpse from the
Austrian side furnished by a Young Gentleman famous afterwards

Leuthen let us premise is a long Hamlet of the usual littery
sort with two rows in some parts three of farmhouses barns
cattlestalls with Church or even with two Churches a Protestant
and a Catholic goes from east to west above a mile in length With the
wrecks of Nadasti tumbling into it pellmell from the southeast and
Lucchesi desperately endeavoring to swing round from the northwest
not quite incoherently and the Prussian firestorm for accompaniment
Leuthen is probably the most chaotic place in the Planet Earth during
that hour or so from halfpast two to halfpast three while the agony
lasted At one oclock Nadasti was attacked at two he is tumbling
in midcareer towards Leuthen I guess the date of this Excerpt or
testimony by a Notable Eyewitness may be halfpast two crisis of the
agony just about to begin and before four it was all finished again
Eyewitness is the young Prince de Ligne now Captain in an Austrian
Regiment of Foot and standing here in this perilous posture having
been called in as part of the Reserve He says

Cry had risen for the Reserve in which was my regiment and that it
must come on as fast as possibleto Leuthen west of us yonder We
ran what we could run Our LieutenantColonel fell killed almost at the
first beyond this we lost our Major and indeed all the Officers but
threethree only and about eleven or twelve of the Voluuteer or Cadet
kind We had crossed two successive ditches which lay in an orchard to
left of the first houses in Leuthen and were beginning to form in
front of the Village But there was no standing of it Besides a general
cannonade such as can hardly be imagined there was a rain of caseshot
upon this Battalion of which I as there was no Colonel left had to
take command and a third Battalion of the Royal Prussian Footguards
which had already made several of our regiments pass that kind of
muster gave at a distance of eighty paces the liveliest fire on us
It stood as if on the paradeground that third Battalion and waited
for us without stirring

The Austrian regiment Andlau at our right hand could not get itself
formed properly by reason of the houses it was standing thirty deep
and sometimes its shot hit us on the back On my left the Austrian
regiment Merci ran its ways and I was glad of that in comparison
By no method or effort could I get the dragoons of Bathyani who stood
fifty yards in rear of me to cut in a little and help me outno
good cutting hereabouts think the dragoons of Bathyani My soldiers
who were still tired with running and had no cannon these either from
necessity or choice they had left behind were got scattered fewer in
number and were fighting mainly out of sullenness More our honor than
the notion of doing good in the affair prevented us from running off
An Ensign of the regiment Arberg helped me awhile to form from his and
my own fragments a kind of line but he was shot down Two Officers
of the Grenadiers brought me what they still had Some Hungarians
too were luckily got together But at last as with all helps and the
remnants of my own brave Battalion I had come down to at most 200 I
drew back to the Height where the Windmill is Kutzen p 103 from
Prince de Lignes DIARY i 63 German Translationwhere many have
drawn back and are standing in sheltered places a hundred deep say
our Books

Stiff fighting at Leuthen especially furious till Leuthen Churchyard
a place with high stone walls was got Leuthen Village we observe was
crammed with Austrians spitting fire from every coign of vantage Church
and Churchyard especially are a citadel of death Cannon playing from
the Windmill Heights toomoments are inestimable The Prussian
Commander name charitably hidden at Leuthen Churchyard seems to
hesitate in the murderous firedeluge Major Mollendorf namable
from that day forward growling No time this for study dashes out
himself EIN ANDRER MANN Follow me whoever is a mansmashes in
the ChurchGate of the place nine muskets blazing on him through it
smashes after a desperate struggle the Austrians clean out of it and
conquers the citadel Muller p 42

The Austrians on confused terms made stiff dispute in this second
position for about an hour The Prussian Reserve was ordered up by
Friedrich the Prussian left wing which had stood refused about
Radaxdorf till now at one time nearly all the Prussians were in fire
Friedrich is here is there wherever the press was greatest Prince
Ferdinand whom we now and then find named as a diligent little
fellow and ascertain to be here in this and other Battles of
FriedrichsPrince Ferdinand at one time pointed his cannon on
the Bush or FirClump of Radaxdorfan aidedecamp came to him with
message You are firing on the King the King is yonder At which
Ferdinand his dear little Brother ERSCHRACK or almost fainted with
terror Kutzen p 110

Stiff dispute and had the Austrians possessed the Prussian dexterity in
manoeuvring and a Friedrich been among themperhaps But on their own
terms there was from the first little hope in it Behind the Windmills
they are a hundred men deep by and by your Windmills riddled to
pieces have to be abandoned the Prussian left wing rushing on with
bayonets will not all of you have to go Lucchesi with his abundant
Cavalry seeing this latter movement and the Prussian flank bare in that
part will do a stroke upon themand this proved properly the finale
of the matter finale to both Lucchesi and it

The Prussian flank was to appearance bare in that leftward quarter but
only to appearance Driesen with the left wing of Horse is in a Hollow
hard by strictly charged by Friedrich to protect said flank and take
nothing else in hand Driesen lets Lucchesi gallop by in this career
of his then emerges ranked and comes storming in upon Lucchesis
backentirely confounding his astonished Cavalry and their career
Astonished Cavalry bulletstorm on this side of them edge of sword
on that take wing in all directions or all except to west and south
quite over the horizon Lucchesi himself gets killedcrosses a still
wider horizon poor man He began the ruin and he ends it For now
Driesen takes the bared Austrians in flank in rear and all goes
tumbling here too and in few minutes is a general deluge rearward
towards Saara and Lissa side

At Saara the Austrians sun just sinking made a third attempt to stand
but it was hopelessly faint this time went all asunder at the first
push and flowed then torrentwise towards all its Bridges over the
Schweidnitz Water towards Breslau by every method There are four
Bridges Stabelwitz below Lissa Goldschmieden Hermannsdorf above and
the main one at Lissa itself a standing Bridge on the Highroad also
of wood and by this the chief torrent flows Prussian horse pursuing
vigorously Prussian Infantry drawn up at Saara resting some minutes

Truly a memorable bit of work no finer done for a hundred years or for
hundreds of years and the results of it manifold immediate and remote
About 10000 Austrians are left on the field 3000 of them slain

in three hours the Battle was done MEINE HERREN said Friedrich that
night at parole after such a spell of work you deserve rest This day
will bring the renown of your name and of the Nations to the latest
posterity

High and low had shone this day especially these four Ziethen
Driesen Retzowand above all Moritz of Dessau Riding up the line as
night fell Friedrich in passing Moritz and the right wing drew bridle
for an instant I congratulate you on the Victory Herr Feldmarschall
cried he cheerily and with emphasis on the last word Moritz still
very busy answered slightly and Friedrich repeated louder Dont
you hear that I congratulate you Herr FELDMARSCHALLa glad sound to
Moritz who ever since Kolin had stood rather in the shadow You have
helped me and performed every order as none ever did before in any
battle added the grateful King

Riding up the line all now grown dusky Friedrich asks Any battalion
a mind to follow me to Lissa Three battalions volunteering follow
him three are plenty At Saara on the Great Road things are fallen

poor Tavern at Saara escorts obediently lantern in his right hand

231235 Like some poor old horseshoe ploughed up on the field Two
farthings worth of rusty old iron now little other than a curve
of brown rust but it galloped at the Battle of Leuthen that is

LANDLORD Yea Excellenz

KING Who are you

LANDLORD Your Excellenz I am the KRATSCHMER Silesian for Landlord
at Saara

KING You have had a great deal to suffer I suppose

LANDLORD ACH your Excellenz had not I For the last eightandforty
hours since the Austrians came across Schweidnitz Water my poor house
has been crammed to the door with them so many servants they have and
such a bullying and tumblingthey have driven me half mad and I am
clean plundered out

KING I am sorry indeed to hear thatWere there Generals too in your
house What said they Tell me then

LANDLORD With pleasure your Excellenz Well yesterday noon I had
Prince Karl in my parlor and his Adjutants and people all crowding
about Such a questioning and bothering Hundreds came dashing in and
other hundreds were sent out in and out they went all night no sooner
was one gone than ten came I had to keep a roaring fire in the kitchen
all night so many Officers crowding to it to warm themselves And
they talked and babbled this and that One would say That our King
was coming on then with his Potsdam GuardParade Another answers
OACH he dare nt come He will run for it we will let him run But
now my delight is our King has paid them their fooleries so prettily
this afternoon

KING When got you rid of your high guests

LANDLORD About nine this morning the Prince got to horse and not long
after three he came past again with a swarm of Officers all going
full speed for Lissa So full of bragging when they came and now they
were off wrong side foremost I saw how it was And ever after him the
flood of them ran Highroad not broad enoughan hour and more before
it ended Such a pellmell such a welter cavalry and musketeers all
jumbled our King must have given them a dreadful lathering That
is what they have got by their bragging and their lyingfor your
Excellenz these people said too Our King was forsaken by his own
Generals all his first people had gone and left him what I never in
this world will believe

KING not liking even rumor of that kind There you are right never
can such a thing be believed of my Army

LANDLORD whom this MY has transfixed MEIN GOTT you are our
GNADIGSTER KONIG most gracious King yourself Pardon pardon if in
my stupidity I have

KING No you are an honest manprobably a Protestant

LANDLORD JOA JOA IHR MAJESTAT I am of your Majestys creed

Crackcrack At this point the Dialogue is cut short by sudden
musketshots from the woody fields to right crackle of about twelve
shots in all which hurt nothing but some horses feethad been aimed
at the light and too low Instantly the light is blown out and there
is a hunting out of Croats Lissa or environs not evacuated yet
it seems and the Kings Entrance takes place under volleyings and
cannonadings

King rides directly to the Schloss which is still a fine handsome
house off the one street of that poor Villagenorth side of street
well railed off and its old ditches and defences now trimmed into
flowerplots The Schloss is full of Austrian Officers bustling about
intending to quarter when the King enters They and the force they
still had in Lissa could easily have taken him but how could they
know Friedrich was surprised but had to put the best face on it In
Kutzen pp 121 209 et seq explanation of the true circumstances and
source of the mistake BON SOIR MESSIEURS said he with a gay
tone stepping in Is there still room left think you The Austrians
bowing to the dust make way reverently to the divinity that hedges a
King of this sort mutely escort him to the best room such the popular
account and for certain make off they and theirs towards the Bridge
which lies a little farther east at the end of the Village

Weistritz or Schweidnitz Water is a biggish muddy stream in that part
gushing and eddying not voiceless vexed by mills and their weirs Some
firing there was from Croats in the lower houses of the Village and
they had a cannon at the farther bridgeend but they were glad to get
away and vanish in the night muddy Weistritz singing hoarse adieu to
their cannon and them Prussian grenadiers plunged indignant into the
houses made short work of the musketries there In few minutes every
Croat and Austrian was across or silenced otherwise too well Prussian
cannon now going in the rear of them and continuing to gosuch had
been the order till the powder you have is done Fire of musketry and
occasional cannon lasts all night from the Lissa or Prussian side of
the Riverlest they burn this Bridge or attempt some mischief A
thing far from their thoughts in present circumstances

The Prussian host at Saara hearing these noises took to its arms
again and marched after the King Thick darkness silence tramp
trampa Prussian grenadier broke out with solemn tenor voice again
into ChurchMusic a known ChurchHymn of the homely TEDEUM kind
in which fiveandtwenty thousand other voices and all the regimental
bands soon join

 Nun dunket alle Gott
 Mit Herzen Mund und Handen
 Der grosse Dinge thut
 An uns und allen Enden Muller p 48

 Now thank God one and all
 With heart with voice with handsa
 Who wonders great hath done
 To us and to all landsa

And thus they advance melodious farsounding through the hollow
Night once more in a highly remarkable manner A pious people of
right Teutsch stuff tender though stout and except perhaps Oliver
Cromwells handful of Ironsides probably the most perfect soldiers ever
seen hitherto Arriving at the end of Lissa and finding all safe as
it should be there they make their bivouac their parallelogram of two
lines miles long across the fields left wing resting on Lissa right
on Guckerwitz andhaving I should think at least tobacco to depend
on with abundant stickfires and healthy joyful heartspass the night
in a thankful comfortable manner

Leuthen was the most complete of all Friedrichs victories two hours
more of daylight as Friedrich himself says and it would have been the
most decisive of this century _OEuvres de Frederic_ iv 167 As it
was the ruin of this big Army 80000 against 30000 89200 was
the Austrian strength before the Battle deduct the Garrisons of
Schweidnitz and Liegnitz Preuss ii 109 from the STAFFOFFICERS
was as good as total and a world of Austrian hopes suddenly collapsed
and all their Silesian Apparatus making sure of Silesia beyond an IF
was tumbled into wreckby this one stroke it had got smiting the
cornerstone of it as if with unexpected lightning On the morrow after
Leuthen Friedrich laid siege to Breslau Karl had left a garrison of
17000 in it and a stout Captain one Sprecher determined on defence
such interests hung on Breslau such immensities of stores were in it
had there been nothing else Friedrich pushing with all his strength
in spite of bad weather and of Sprechers industrious defence got it
in twelve days 7th19th December DIARIUM c of it in
_HeldenGeschichte_ iv 955961 Sprecher had posted placards on the
gallows and up and down terrifically proclaiming that any man convicted
of mentioning surrender should be instantly hanged but Friedrichs
bombardment was strong his assaults continual and the ditches were
threatening to freeze On the seventh day of the siege a Laboratorium
blew up on the ninth a PowderMagazine carrying a lump of the rampart
away with it Sprecher had to capitulate Prisoners of War we 17000
our cannons ammunitions most opulent including what we took from
Bevern lately these we and Breslau altogether alas it is all yours
again Liegnitz Garrison seeing no hope consented to withdraw on
leave 26th December _HeldenGeschichte_ iv 1016 Schweidnitz
cannot be besieged till Spring come except Schweidnitz Maria Theresa
the high Kaiserinn has no foot of ground in Silesia which she thought
to be hers again Gone utterly Patents and all Schweidnitz alone
waiting till spring To the lively joy of Silesia in general to the
thricelively sorrow and alarm of certain individuals leading Catholic
Ecclesiastics mainly who had misread the signs of the times in late
months There is one Schaffgotsch Archbishop or headman of them
especially who is now in a bad way Never was such royal favor never
such ingratitude say the Books at wearisome length Schaffgotsch was
a showy man of quality nephew of the quondam Austrian Governor whom
Friedrich across a good deal of Papal and other opposition got pushed
into the Catholic Primacy and took some pains to make comfortable
thereOrder of the Black Eagle guest at Potsdam and the
likehaving a kind of fancy for the airy Schaffgotsch as well
as judging him suitable for this Silesian HighPriesthood with his
moderate ideas and quality wayswhich I have heard were a little
dissolute withal To the whole of which Schaffgotsch proved signally
traitorous and ingrate and had plucked off the Black Eagle say the
Books nearly breathless over such a sacrilege on some public occasion
prior to Leuthen and trampled it under his feet the unworthy fellow
Schaffgotschs pathetic Letter to Friedrich in the new days posterior
to Leuthen and Friedrichs contemptuous inexorable answer we could
give but do not why should we O King I know your difficulties and
what epoch it is But of a truth your airy dissolute Schaffgotsch as
a grateful Archbishop and GrandVicar is almost uglier to me than as
a Traitor ungrateful for it and shall go to the Devil in his own way
They would not have him in Austria he was not well received at Rome
happily died before long Preuss ii 113 114 Kutzen pp 12
155160 for the real particculars Friedrich was not cruel to
Schaffgotsch or the others contemptuously mild rather but he knew
henceforth what to expect of them and slightly changed this and that in
his Silesian methods in consequence

Of Prince Karl let us add a word On the morrow after Leuthen Captain
Prince de Ligne and old Papa DAhremberg could find little or no Army
they stept across to Grabschen a village on the safe side of the
Lohe and there found Karl and Daun rather silent both one of
them looking Who would have thought it the other Did nt I tell
youand knowing nothing they either where the Army was Army was
in fact as yet nowhere Croat fellows in this Farmstead of ours
says De Ligne had fallen to shooting pigeons The night had been
unusually dark the Austrian Army had squatted into woods into
officehouses farmvillages over a wide space of country and only as
the day rose began to dribble in By count they are still 50000 but
heartbroken beaten as men seldom were What sound is that men asked
yesterday at Brieg forty miles off and nobody could say except that
it was some huge Battle fateful of Silesia and the world Breslau had
it louder Breslau was still more anxious What IS all that asked
somebody might be Deblin the Shoemaker for anything I know of an
Austrian sentry there That That is the Prussians giving us such a
beating as we never had What news for Deblin the Shoemaker if he is

Prince Karl gathering his distracted fragments put 17000 into
Breslau by way of ample garrison there and with the rest made off
circuitously for Schweidnitz thence for Landshut and down the
Mountains home to Konigsgratzself and Army in the most wrecked

Army not a little dilapidated writes Prince Karl almost with tears in
his eyes Army without linens without clothes in condition truly sad
and pitiable and has always so close are the enemy to encamp though

14th Did not get to Konigsgratz and safe shelter for ten days
more Counted at Konigsgratz in the Christmas time 37000 rank and

Universal astonishment indignation even incredulity is the humor
at Vienna the high Kaiserinn herself kept in the dark for some time
becomes dimly aware and by Kaiser Franzs own advice she relieves
Prince Karl from his military employments and appoints Daun instead
Prince Karl withdrew to his Government of the Netherlands and with the
aid of generous liquors and what natural magnanimity he had spent
a noiseless life thenceforth Sword laid entirely on the shelf and
immortal Glory as of Alexander and the like quite making its exit from
the scene convivial or other The first General in the world so
he used to be ten years ago in Austria in England Holland the
thricegreatest of Generals but now he has tried Friedrich in Five
pitched Battles Czaslau Hohenfriedberg Sohr then Prag then
Leuthenbeen beaten every time under every form of circumstance and
now at Leuthen the fifth beating is such no public however ignorant
can stand it farther The ignorant public changes its longeared
eulogies into contumeliously horrid shrieks of condemnation in which
one is still farther from joining That crossing of the Rhine says
Friedrich was a BELLE CHOSE but flatterers blew him into dangerous
selfconceit besides he was illobeyed as others of us have been

to himat least if he can take it in moderation

The astonishment of all men wise and simple at this sudden oversetting
of the scene of things and turning of the gazetteerdiplomatic theatre
bottom uppermost was naturally extreme especially in gazetteer
and diplomatic circles and the admiration willing or unwilling of
Friedrich in some most essential points of him rose to a high pitch
Better soldier it is clear has not been heard of in the modern ages
Heroic constancy courage superior to fate several clear features of a
heropity he were such a liar withal and ignorant of common honesty
thought the simple sort in a bewildered manner endeavoring to forget
the latter features or think them not irreconcilable Military judges
of most various quality down to this day pronounce Leuthen to be
essentially the finest Battle of the century and indeed one of the
prettiest feats ever done by man in his Fighting Capacity Napoleon
for instance who had run over these Battles of Friedrich apparently
somewhat in haste but always with a word upon them which is worth
gathering from such a source speaks thus of Leuthen This Battle is
a masterpiece of movements of manoeuvres and of resolution enough
to immortalize Friedrich and rank him among the greatest Generals

December 1757Your friendship seduces you MON CHER I am but a
paltry knave POLISSON in comparison with Alexander and not worthy

evils of a like nature

We have got here this day by capitulation of Breslau from
fourteen to fifteen thousand prisoners so that in all I have above
twentythree thousand of the Queens troops in my hands fifteen
Generals and above seven hundred Officers T is a plaster on my
wounds but it is far enough from healing them

I am now about marching to the Mountain region to settle the chain of

2 A POTTERYAPOTHEOSIS OF FRIEDRICHThere stands on this
mantelpiece says one of my Correspondents the amiable Smelfungus in
short whom readers are acquainted with a small China Mug not of bad
shape declaring itself in one obscure corner to be made at Worcester
R I Worcester 1757 late in the season I presume demand being
brisk which exhibits all round it a diligent PottersApotheosis
of Friedrich hastily got up to meet the general enthusiasm of English
mankind Worth while it lasts unbroken a moments inspection from you
in hurrying along

Front side when you take our Mug by the handle for drinking from it
offers a poor wellmeant China Portrait labelled KING OF PRUSSIA Copy
of Friedrichs Portrait by Pesne twenty years too young for the time
smiling out nobly upon you upon whom there descends with rapidity a
small Genius more like a Cupid who had hastily forgotten his bow and
goes headforemost on another errand to drop a wreath on this deserving
headwreath far too small for ever getting on owing to distance
let us hope though the artless Painter makes no sign and indeed both
Genius and wreath as he gives them look almost like a big insect
which the King will be apt to treat harshly if he notice it On the
opposite side again separated from Friedrichs back by the handle
is an enormous image of Fame with wings filling half the Mug with two
trumpets going at once a bass probably and a treble who flies
with great ease and between her eager face end the unexpectant one of
Friedrich who is 180 degrees off and knows nothing of it stands
a circular Trophy or Imbroglio of drums pikes muskets cannons
fieldflags and the like very slightly tied togetherthe knot
if there is one being hidden by some fantastic bit of scroll or
escutcheon with a Fame and ONE trumpet scratched on itand high out
of the Imbroglio rise three standards inscribed with Names which we
perceive are intended to be names of Friedrichs Victories standards
notable at this day with Names which I will punctually give you

Standard first which flies to the westward or leftward has
Reisberg no such place on this distracted globe but meaning Beverns
REICHENBERG perhapsReisberg Prague Collin Middle standard
curves beautifully round its staff and gives us to read Welham

Breslau poor Beverns thought a VICTORY in Worcester at this time
Standard third which flies to eastward or right hand has Neumark
that is NEUMARKT and the Austrian Breadovens 4th December Lissa
not yet LEUTHEN in English nomenclature and Breslau again which
means the capture of Breslau CITY this time and is a real success

FRIEDRICH TO DARGENS three different times

1 ON THE ROAD TO LEUTHEN Torgau 15th November 1757 I have
been obliged to have the Abbe arrested De Prades of whom enough long
since he has been playing the spy and I have many evident proofs of
it That is very infamous and very ungratefulI have made a prodigious
quantity of verses PRODIGIEUSEMENT DE VERS If I live I will show
them you in Winterquarters if I perish they are bequeathed to you
and I have ordered that they be put into your hand

Adieu my dear Marquis I fancy you to be in bed dont rot thereand
remember you have promised to join me in Winterquarterson this
latter point Friedrich is very urgent amiably eager prepared to wrap
the poor Marquis in cotton and carry him and lodge him like glass with
care _OEuvres de Frederic_ xix 43 For example

3 FRIEDRICH ON THE FIELD AGAIN FOR FIVE WEEKS PAST Munsterberg
23d April 1758 Adieu dear Marquis I fancy you are now in Berlin
again Go to Charlottenburg whenever and how you like take care of
yourself and be ready for the beginning of October nextAs to me MON
CHER I am off to fight windmills and ostriches AUTRUCHES that is

There circulated in the Newspapers this Winter something of what was
called a LETTER from Friedrich to Maria Theresa formally proposing
Peace after these magnificent successes And certainly of all things
in the Earth Friedrich would have best liked Peace this year last
year and for the next five years Go home then good neighbors dont
break into my house dont cut my poor throat and we will be friends
again Friedrich it appears had actually finding or making
opportunity sent some polite Letter of pacific tenor in his light
clever way to that addressnot without momentary hopes of perhaps
getting good from it In PREUSS ii 130 Friedrichs Letter mostly
givenbearer a Prince van Lobkowitz prisoner at Leuthen now going

of these people by any Letter or human device whatever except simply
by uttermost more or less miraculous fighting for it Friedrich is
profoundly aware of this factis busy completing his Army 145000
for the field this Year 53000 the Silesian part a good many of
them Austrian deserters Stenzel v 155 and is closing an important
Subsidy Treaty with Englandof which more anon

And if this is the mood in France and Austria think what Russias will
be The Czarina is not dead of dropsy as some had expected but on
the contrary alive and fiercer than ever furious against Apraxin and
determined that Fermor his successor shall defy Winter and begin
work at once She has indignantly dismissed Apraxin to be tried by
CourtMartial he dismisses Bestuchef the Chancellor appoints a new
General Fermor by name orders Fermor to go and lose not a moment now
in the depth of Winter since it was not done in the crown of Summer and
take possession of East Preussen in her name

Which Fermor does 16th January crosses the border again 31000 in
all without opposition except from the frost plants himself up and
downonly two poor Prussian battalions there who retire with their
effects especially with seven wagons of money January 22d Fermor
enters Konigsberg publishes no end of proclamations manifestoes
rescripts to inform the poor people trembling at the Cossack
atrocities of last Year That his august Sovereign Elizabeth of All
the Russias has now become Proprietress of East Preussen which shall be
perfectly protected and exquisitely wellgoverned henceforth and that
all men of official or social position have accordingly to come and
take the oath to her with the due alacrity and punctuality at their
peril

No man is willing for the operation most men shudder at it but who can
help them Surely it was an unblessed operation Poor souls one pities
them for at heart they were and continued loyal to their own King
thoroughly abhorrent of becoming Russian as Czarish Majesty has
thoroughly resolved they shall Some few absconded leaving their
property as spoil the rest swore with mental reservation with shifts
such as they could devisefor example some were observed to swear
with gloves on the right hand which they held up was a mere right
FIST with a stuffed glove at the end of itSO help me Beelzebub or
whoever is the recording Angel here _HeldenGeschichte_ v 141149
Preuss ii 145 iii 578 iv 477 c And thus does Preussen with
astonishment as by the spell of a Czarina Circe find itself changed
suddenly to Russian and does not recover the old human form till four
years hencewhen again suddenly as we shall see the Circe and her
wand chance to get broken

Friedrich could not mend or prevent this bad Business but was so
disgusted with it he never set foot in East Preussen againnever
could bear to behold it after such a transformation into temporary
Russian shape I cannot say he abhorred this constrained Oath as I
should have done on the contrary in the first spurt of indignation he
not only protested aloud but made reprisalsSwear ME those Saxons
then said he and some poor magistrates of towns and official
people had to make a figure of swearing if not allegiance altogether
allegiance for the time being in the same sad fashion till ones
humor cooled again Preuss ii 163 Oath given in _HeldenGeschichte_
v 631 East Preussen lost in this way held by its King as before or
more passionately now than ever still loved Friedrich say the Books
but it is Russias for the present and the mischief is done East
Preussen itself Circe Czarina cherishing it as her own had a much
peaceabler time in secret it even sent moneys recruits numerous young
volunteers to Friedrich much more hopes and prayers But his disgust
with the late transformation by enchantment was inexpiable

It was May or June as had been anticipated before the Russian main
Army made its practical appearance in those parts Fermor had in the
interim seized Thorn seized Elbing No offence magnanimous Polacks
it is only for a timeand would fain have had Dantzig too but
Dantzig would nt Not till June 16th did the unwieldy mass on paper
104000 and in effect and exclusive of Cossack rabble about 75000
get on way and begin slowly staggering westward Very slowly and amid
incendiary fire and horrid cruelty as heretoforeand in August coming
we shall be sure to hear of it

Lehwald was just finishing with the Swedeshad got them all bottled up
in Stralsund again about NewYears time when these Russians crossed
into Preussen We said nothing of the Swedish socalled Campaign of last
Yearand indeed are bound to be nearly silent of that and of all
the others Five Campaigns of them or at least Four and a half such
Campaigns as were never made before or since Of Campaign 1757 the
memorable feature is that of the whole Swedish Division as the
laughing Newspapers called it which was put to flight by five Berlin
Postilionssubstantially a truth as follows

Night of September 12th13th 1757 the Swedes 22000 strong did at
last begin business crossed Peene River the boundary between their
Pommern and ours and having nothing but some fractions of Militia
to oppose them soon captured the Redoubts there spread over Prussian
Pommern and on into the Uckermark diligently raising contributions
to a heavy amount No less than 90000 pounds in all for this poor
Province though by a strange accident 60000 pounds proved to be the
actual sum

Towards the end of October they had got as much as 60000 pounds from
the northern parts of Uckermark Prentzlow being their headquarter
during that operation and they now sent out a Detachment of 200
grenadiers and 100 dragoons towards Zehdenick another little Town some
forty miles farther south there to wring out the remaining sum The
Detachment marched by night not courting notice but people had heard
of its coming and five Prussian Postilionsshifty fellows old
hussars it may be at any rate skilful on the trumpet and furnished
with hussar jackets and an old pistol each determined to do something
for their Country The Swedish Detachment had not marched many miles
whenafter or before some flourishes of martial trumpetingthere
verily fell on the Swedish flank out of a clump of dark wood five
shots and wounded one man To the astonishment and panic of the other
two hundred and ninetynine who made instant retreat under new shots
and trumpettones as if it were from five whole hussar regiments
retreat doublequick to Prentzlow alarm waxing by the speed alarm
spreading at Prentzlow itself so that the whole Division got to its
feet recrossed the Peene and Uckermark had nothing more to pay for
that bout This is not a fable such as go in the Newspapers adds my
Authority but an accurate fact _ HeldenGeschichte_ iv 764 807
Archenholtz i 160probably in our day the alone memorable one of
that Swedish War

The French says another of my Notes who did the subsidying all
round who paid even the Russian Subsidy though in Austrias name had
always an idea that the Swedes22000 stout men this year 4000 of
them cavalrymight be made to cooperate with the Russians with them
or with somebody and do something effective in the way of destroying
Friedrich And besides their subsidies and bribings the French
took incredible pains with this view incessantly contriving
correspondencing and running to and fro between the parties For
example M le Marquis de Montalembert CORRESPONDANCE AVEC c ETANT
EMPLOYE PAR LE ROI DE FRANCE A LARMEE SUEDOISE 17571761 with the
Swedish Army yes and sometimes with the Russianand sometimes on
the French Coasts ardently fortifying against Pitt and his Descents

short a great deal of fine faculty employed there in spinning ropes
from sand but had not even from the Russians and Czarish Majesty
much of a result and from the Swedes had absolutely none at all By
French industry and flagitation the Swedish Army was generally kept
up to about 20000 the soldiers were expert with their fightingtools
knew their fieldexercise well had fine artillery and were stout
hardy fellows but the guidance of them was wonderful They had no
fieldcommissariat says one Observer no fieldbakery no magazines
no pontoons no light troops and among the Higher Officers no
subordination Archenholtz i 158 Were in short commanded by
nobody in particular Commanded by Senator Committeemen in Stockholm
and on the field by Generals anxious to avoid responsibility who
instead of acting held continual Councils of War The history of their
Campaigns year after year is in summary this

Late in the season always late WarOffices at home and Captaincies
here being in such a state they emerged from Stralsund an
impregnable place of their ownwhere the men I observe have had
to live on dried fishy substances instead of natural boiled oatmeal
Montalembert i 3237 335 394 c that of the demand for Neise
PORRIDGE which interested me I cannot find again and have died
extensively in consequencethey march from Stralsund a forty or
thirty miles till they reach the SwedishPommern boundary Peene River
a muddy sullen stream flowing through quagmire meadows which are miles
broad on each shore River unfordable everywhere only to be crossed
in four or five places where paved causeways are The Swedes with
deliberation cross Peene after some time capture the bits of
Redoubts and the one or two poor Prussian Towns upon it Anklam
Redoubt PEENEMUNDE Peenemouth Redoubt and rove forward into
Prussian Pommern or over into the Uckermark for fifty for a hundred
miles exacting contributions foraging what they can making the poor
countrypeople very miserable and themselves not happytheir soldiers
growing yearly more plunderous says Archenholtz till at length they
got though much shyer of murder to resemble Cossacks in regard to
other pleas of the crown

There is generally some fractional regiment or two of Prussian force
left under some select General Manteuffel Colonel Belling who hangs
diligently on the skirts of them exploding by all opportunities There
have been Country Militias voluntarily got on foot for the occasion
five or six small regiments of them officered by Prussian Veterans of
the Squirearchy in those parts who do excellent service The Governor
of Stettin Bevern our old Silesian friend strikes out now and then
always vigilant prompt and effective on a chance offering This
through Summer is what opposition can be made and the Swedes without
magazines scoutservice or the like military appliances but willing
enough to fight when they can see and living on their shifts will
rove inward perhaps 100 miles say southwestward say southeastward
towards Ruppin which we used to knowthey love to keep Mecklenburg
usually on their flank which is a friendly Country Small fights befall
them usually beatings never anything considerable That is their
success through Summer

Then in Autumn some remnant more of Prussian regulars arrive
disposable now for that service upon which the Swedes are driven over
Peene again quite sure to be driven when the River with its quagmires
freezes lose Anklam Redoubt Peenemunde Redoubt lose Demmin Wollin
are followed into Swedish Pommern oftenest to the gates of Stralsund
and are locked up there there and in Rugen adjoining till a new
season arriveThis year 17571758 Lehwald on turning the key of
Stralsund might have done a fine feat frost having come suddenly and
welded Rugen to mainland What is to hinder you from starving them into
surrender signifies Friedrich hastily Besiege me Stralsund Which
Lehwald did but should have been quicker about it or the thaw came
too soon and admitted ships with provision again Upon which Lehwald
resigned to a General Graf von Dohna and went home as grown too old
and Dohna kept them bottled there till the usual Russian Advent deep in
June by which time what with limited stockfish diet what with
sore labor breaking of the ice whenever frost reappeared and other
hardship more than half of them had diedEvery new season there
was a new General tried but without the least improvement There
was mockery enough complaint enough indignant laughter in Stockholm
itself and the Dalecarlians thought of revolting but the Senator
Committeemen held firm ballasted by French gold for four years

The Prussian Militias are a fine trait of the matter about fifteen
regiments in different partsabout five in Pommern which set
the example which were suddenly raised last Autumn by the STANDE
themselves drilled in Stettin continually while the Swedes were
under way and which stood ready for some action under veterans of the
squirearchy when the Swedes arrived They were kept up through the
War The STANDE even raised a little fleet Archenholtz i 110 river
fleet and coast fleet twelve gunboats with a powerful carronade in
each and effective men and captain a great check on plundering and
coast mischief till the Swedes who are naval at last made an effort
and destroyed them all

Friedrich was very sensible of these procedures on the part of his
STANDE and perhaps readers are not prepared for such or for others
of the like which we could produce elsewhere in a Country without
Constitution to speak of Friedrich raises no new taxesexcept upon
himself exclusively and these to the very bloodFriedrich gets no
LifeandFortune Addresses of the vocal or printed sort but only of
the acted Very much the preferable kind where possible to all parties
concerned These poor militias and flotillas one cheerfully puts on
record cheerfully nothing else in regard to such a Swedish Warnor
shall we henceforth insult the human memory by another word upon it that
is not indispensable




OF THE ENGLISH SUBSIDY

One of Friedrichs most important affairs at presentvitally
connected with his Army and its furnishings which is the
allimportantwas his Subsidy Treaty with England It is the third
treaty he has signed with England in regard to this War the second in
regard to subsidy for it and it is the first that takes real practical
effect It had cost difficulty in adjusting not a little correspondence
and management from Mitchell for the King is very shy about subsidy
though grim necessity prescribes it as inevitable and his pride and
his reflections on the last Subsidy Treaty One Million sterling Army
of Observation and Fleet in the Baltic instead of which came Zero and
KlosterZeven have made him very sensitive However all difficulties
are got over Plenipotentiary Knyphausen Pitt Britannic Majesty and
everybody striving to be rational and practical and at London 11th
April 1758 Subsidy Treaty admirably brief and to the point is
finished In four short Articles given in _ HeldenGeschichte_ v 16
17 That Friedrich shall have Four Million Thalers that is 670000
pounds payable in London to his order in October this Year which
sum Friedrich engages to spend wholly in maintenance and increase of his
Army for behoof of the common objectneither party to dream of making
the least shadow of peace or truce without the other Of Baltic Fleet
there is nothing said nor in regard to that was anything done this
year or afterwards highly important as it would have been to Friedrich
with the Navies so called of both Sweden and Russia doing their worst
upon him Why not spare me a small English squadron and blow these
away Nor was the why ever made clear to him the private why being
that Czarish Majesty had last year intimated to Britannic Any such
step on your part will annihilate the now old friendship of Russia and
England and be taken as a direct declaration of Warwhich Britannic
Majesty for commercial and miscellaneous reasons hoped always might be
avoided Be silent therefore on that of Baltic Fleet

In all the spoken or covenanted points the Treaty was accurately kept
670000 pounds twothirds of a million very nearly will in punctual
promptitude come to Friedrichs hand were October here And in regard
to Ferdinand a point left silent this too Friedrichs expectations
were exceeded not the contrary so long as Pitt endured This is the
Third EnglishPrussian Treaty of the SevenYears War as we said above
and it is the First that took practical effect this was followed by
three others year after year of precisely the same tenor which
were likewise practical and punctually keptthe last of them 12th
December 1760 had reference to Subsidy for 1761and before another
came Pitt was out So that in all Friedrich had Four Subsidies
670000 pounds x42680000 pounds of English money altogetherand it
is computed by some there was never as much good fighting otherwise had
out of all the 800000000 pounds we have funded in that peculiar
line of enterprise First Treaty 16th January 1756 is in
_HeldenGeschichte_ iii 681 We will oppose by arms any foreign
Armament entering Germany Second Treaty 11th January 1757 never
published till 1802 is in Scholl iii 3032 one million subsidy
a Fleet c not KEPT at all after which Third Treaty the FIRST
really issuing in subsidy and performance is 11th April 1758 given in
_HeldenGeschichte_ v 17 Fourth really SECOND 7th December 1758
Ib v 752 Fifth THIRD 9th November 1759 Sixth FOURTH 12th
December 1760 See PREUSS ii 124 n

Pitt had no difficulty with his Parliament or with his Public in
regard to this Subsidy the contrary rather Seldom if ever was
England in such a heat of enthusiasm about any Foreign Man as about
Friedrich in these months since Rossbach and what had followed

No 3 MISS BARBARA WYNDHAMS SUBSIDY March 13th 1758while Pitt
and Knyphausen are busy on the Subsidy Treaty still not out with it
the Newspapers suddenly announce

Miss Bab Wyndham of Salisbury sister of Henry Wyndham Esq of that
City a maiden lady of ample fortune has ordered her banker to prepare
the sum of 1000 pounds to be immediately remitted in her own name
as a present to the King of Prussia _ London Chronicle_ March
14th16th 1758 _ Lloyds Evening Post_ c c Doubtless to the King
of Prussias surprise and that of London Society which would not want
for commentaries on such a thing

Before long the Subsidy Treaty being now out and the Wyndham topic new
again London Society reads in the same Newspaper a Documentary Piece
calculated to help in its commentaries There is good likelihood of
guess though no certainty now attainable that the English Lady
referred to may be Miss Bab herselfof whose longvanished biography
and brisk airy nomadic ways we catch hereby a faint shadow
momentary but conceivable and sufficient for us


TO THE AUTHORS OF THE LONDON CHRONICLE _London Chronicle_ of
13th15th April 1758

The following Account which is a real fact will serve to show with
what punctuality and exactness the King of Prussia attends to the most
minute affairs and how open he is to applications from all persons

An English Lady being possessed of actions shares in the Embden
Company and having occasion to raise money on them repaired to Antwerp
some two years ago as will be seen and made application for that
purpose to a Director of the Company established there by the King of
Prussia for the managing all affairs relative thereto This person Van
Erthorn the name of him very willingly entered into treaty with her
but the sum he offered to lend being far short of what the actions would
bring and he also insisting on forfeiture of her right in them if not
redeemed in twelve monthsshe broke off with him and had recourse to
some merchants at Antwerp who were inclinable to treat with her on much
more equitable terms The proceeding necessarily brought the parties
before this Director for receiving his sanction which was essential to
the solidity of the agreement and he finding he was like to lose the
advantage he had flattered himself with disputed the authenticity of
the actions and thereby threw her into such discredit as to render all
attempts to raise money on them ineffectual Upon this the Lady wrote a
Letter by the common post to his Majesty of Prussia accompanied with
a Memorial complaining of the treatment she had received from the
Director and she likewise enclosed the actions themselves in another
letter to a friend at Berlin By the return of the post his Majesty
condescended to answer her Letter and the actions were returned
authenticated which so restored her credit that in a few hours all
difficulties were removed relating to the transaction she had in
hand and it is more than probable the Director has felt his Majestys
resentment for his illbehaviorThe Ladys Letter was as follows

ANTWERP 19th February 1756

SIRHaving had the happiness to pay my court to your Majesty
during a pretty long residence at Berlin say in Voltaires time Miss
Barbaras Embden Company I observe was the first of the two date
1750 that of 1753 is not hers and to receive such marks of favor from
their Majesties the Queens a Barbara capable of shining in the Royal
soirees at Monbijou of talking to or of your Voltaires and lions
and investing moneys in the new Embden Company as I shall ever retain
a grateful sense ofI presume to flatter myself that your Majesty will
not be offended at the respectful liberty I have taken in laying before
you my complaints against one Van Erthorn a Director of the Embden
China Company whose bad behavior to me as set forth in my Memorial
hath forced me to make a very long and expensive stay at this place
and as the considerable interest I have in that Company may farther
subject me to his caprices I cannot forbear laying my grievances at
the foot of your Majestys throne most respectfully supplicating your
Majesty that you would be graciously pleased to give orders that
this Director shall not act towards me for the future as he hath done
hitherto

I hope for this favor from your Majestys sovereign equity and I
shall never cease offering up my ardent prayers for the prosperity of
your glorious reign having the honor to be with the most respectful
zeal Sir your Majestys most humble most obedient and most devoted
servant   


THE KING OF PRUSSIAS ANSWER

POTSDAM 26th February 1756

MADAMI received the Letter of the 19th instant which you thought
proper to write to me and was not a little displeased to hear of the
bad behavior of one of the Directors of the Asiatic Company of Embden
towards you of which you were forced to complain I shall direct your
grievances to be examined and have just now despatched my orders for
that purpose to Lenz my President of the Chamber of East Friesland
Chief Judge in those parts Seyfarth ii 139 You may assure
yourself the strictest justice shall be done you that the case will
admit God keep you in his holy protection FRIEDRICH

Whether this refers to Miss Barbara or not there is no affirming
But the interesting point is Friedrich did receive and accept Miss
Barbaras 1000 pounds The Prussian account which calls her an
English JUNGFRAU LADY SALISBURY who actually sent a sum of money
Preuss ii 124 whose reference is merely _ Gentlemans Magazine_
for 1758 Both in the ANNUAL REGISTER of that Year i 86and in the
_Gentlemans Magazine_ pp 142 177 the above Paragraph and Letters
are copied from the Newspapers but without the smallest commentary
there or elsewhere or any mention of a Lady Salisbury would not
itself be satisfactory but by good chance there is still living in
Salisbury City a very aged Gentleman well known for his worth and
intelligence on such matters who being inquired of makes reply at
once That the First Earl of Malmesbury who was of his acquaintance
and had many anecdotes and reminiscences of Friedrich all noted down
it was understood with diplomatic exactitude but never yet published
or become accessible did as I well remember among other things
mention the Kings telling him that he the King had received a
Thousand Pounds from Miss Wyndham with a part of which he had bought
the Flute then in his hand Letter from John Fowler Esq Salisbury
2d April 1860 to a Friend of mine PENES ME of Barbaras identity
or otherwise with the Antwerp Embden Lady Mr F can say nothing
Which latter circumstance too is curious For at all times however
straitened Friedrichs Exchequer might be it was his known habit
during this War to have always before the current year ended the ways
and means completely settled and provided for the year coming so that
everything could be at once paid in money good money or badgood
still up to this dateAnd nothing was observed to fall short so much
as the customary liberality of his gifts to those about him I infer
therefore Friedrich had decided to lay out this 1000 pounds in what he
would call luxuries chiefly giftsand among other things had said
to himself I will have a new flute too Probably one of his last
for I understand he had by this time Malmesburys time 1772
ceased much playing and ceased altogether not long after Preuss i
371373

James Harris First Earl of Malmesbury was Resident at Berlin 1772
that is all the date we have for the Kings saying And with part of
it I bought this Flute Date of Lord Malmesburys mention of it at
Salisbury we have nonelikeliest there might be various dates
a thing mentioned more than once and not improvable by dating
The Wyndhams still live in the Close of Salisbury a respected and
wellknown Family record of them none of Barbara there or elsewhere
except here to be found in the County Histories Brittons _Beauties
of England and Wales_ _xv part ii p 118 Hoares _Salisbury_
_mistaken p 815 c I only know farther Barbara died May 1765
aged and wealthy and with the bulk of her fortune endowed a Charity
to be called Wyndham College ANNUAL REGISTER for 1765 viii
86which I hope still flourishes Enough on this small Wyndham
matter which is nearly altogether English but in which Friedrich too
has his indefeasible property




FRIEDRICH AS INDEED PITTS PEOPLE AND OTHERS HAVE DONE TAKES THE FIELD
UNCOMMONLY EARLY FRIEDRICH GOES UPON SCHWEIDNITZ SCHWEIDNITZ AS THE
PREFACE TO WHATEVER HIS CAMPAIGN MAY BE

While this Subsidy Treaty is getting settled in England Duke Ferdinand
has his French in full cackle of universal flight and before the
signing of it April 11th every feather of them is over the Rhine
Duke Ferdinand busy preparing to follow Glorious news day after day
coming in for Pitt for Miss Barbara and for all English souls Royal
Highness of Cumberland hardly excepted The Descent on Rochefort last
Autumn had a good deal disappointed Pitt and Englandan expensively
elaborate Expedition military and naval which could not descend at
all when it got to the point but merely went groping about on
the muddy shores of the Charente holding councils of war yonder
cannonaded the Isle of Aix for two hours and returned home without
result of any kind Courtsmartial following on it as too usual This
was an unsuccessful firststroke for Pitt Indeed he never did much
succeed in those Descents on the French Coast though never again so ill
as this time Those are a kind of things that require an exactitude
as of clockwork in all their parts and Pitts Generalcies and
WarOfficeswe know whether they were of the Prussian type or of the
Swedish A very grievous hindrance to Pittwhich he will not believe
to be quite incurable Against which he for his part stands up in
grim earnest and with his whole strength and is now and at all times
doing what in him lies to abate or remedy itsuccessfully to an
unexpected degree within the next four years From America he has
decided to recall Lord Loudon as a cunctatory haggling mortal the
reverse of a General how very different from his Austrian Cousin
Cousins certainly enough their Progenitors were Brothers of that
House about 1568when Matthew the cadet went into Livonia
into foreign Soldiering Papa having fallen Prisoner at the Battle of
Langside 1568 and the Family prospects being low from this Matthew
comes through a scrips of Livonian Soldiers the famed Austrian
Loudon Douglas _Peerage of Scotland_ p 425 c c VIE DE LOUDON
illinformed on that point and some others says the first Livonian
Loudon came from Ayrshire in the fourteenth century Abercrombie
may be better hopes hewas better still not good But already in
the gloomy imbroglio over yonder Pitt discerns that one Amherst the
son of people unimportant at the hustings has military talent and
in this puddle of a Rochefort Futility he has got his eye on a young
Officer named Wolfe who was Quartermaster of the Expedition a young
man likewise destitute of Parliamentary connection but who may be worth
something Both of whom will be heard of In a four years determined
effort of this kind things do improve and it was wonderful to
what amountout of these chaotic WarOffices little better than the
Swedish and ignorant Generalcies fully worse than the SwedishPitt
got heroic successes and work really done

On Pitt amid confused clouds there is bright dawn rising and
Friedrich too for the last month in Breslau has a cheerful prospect
on that Western side of his horizon Here is one of his Postscripts
thrown off in Autograph which Duke Ferdinand will read with pleasure
I congratulate you MON CHER with my whole heart May you FLEURDELYS

Friedrich grounding partly on those Rhine aspects has his own scheme
laid for Campaign 1758 It is the old scheme tried twice already to go
home upon your Enemy swiftly with your utmost collective strength and
try to strike into the heart of him before he is aware Friedrich has
twice tried this the second time with success respectable though far
short of complete Weakened as now but with Ferdinand likely to
find the French in employment he means to try it again and is busy
preparing at Neisse and elsewhere though keeping it a dead secret for
the time There is in fact no other hopeful plan for him if this
prove feasible at all Double your velocity you double your momentum
Ones weight is givenweight growing less and lessbut not or not
in the same way and degree ones velocity ones rightness of aim
Weight given it is only by doubling or trebling his velocity that a man
can make his momentum double or treble as needed Friedrich means to
try it readers will see howwere the Fort of Schweidnitz once had
for which object Friedrich watches the weather like a very DArgens
eager that the frost would go Recapture of Schweidnitz the last
speck of Austrianism wiped away there that is evidently the preface to
whatsoever dayswork may be ahead

March 15th frost being now off Friedrich quits Breslau and

goes at once upon Schweidnitz With the top of the morning so to speak
means to have Schweidnitz before campaigning usually can begin or
common laborers take their tools in this trade The Austrian Commandant
has been greatly strengthening the works he had at first some 8000
of garrison but the three months blockade has been tight upon him and
them and it is hoped the thing can be done

Chapter XIISIEGE OF OLMUTZ

Fouquet on the first movement towards Schweidnitz had been detached
from Landshut to sweep certain Croat Parties out of Glatz Ziethen with
a similar view into Troppau Country both which errands were at once
perfectly done Daun lies behind the Bohemian Frontier betimes in the
field he too arrived at Konigsgratz March 13th and is with all
diligence perfecting his new levies intrenching himself on all points
as man seldom did felling whole forests they say building abatis
within abatisnot doubting especially on these ZiethenFouquet
symptoms but Friedrichs Campaign is to be an Invasion of Bohemia
again Which he shall not do gratis hopes Daun and indeed judges
say the entrance would hardly have been possible on that side had
Friedrich tried it which he did not

Schweidnitz being done and Daun deep in the Bohemian
problemFriedrich in an unintelligible manner breaks out from
Grussau and the Landshut region April 19th25th not straight
southward as Daun had been expecting but straight southeastward
through Neisse Jagerndorf all gone or all but Ziethen and Fouquet
gone that waymeaning who shall say what when news of it comes to
Daun In two divisions from 30 to 40000 strong through Jagerndorf
ever onward through Troppau and not till THEN turning southward
indubitable march of that cunning Enemy rapidly proceeding his 40000
and he along those elevated upland countries watershed of the Black
Sea and the Baltic bleakly illumined by the April sun a march into the
mists of the future tense which do not yet clear themselves to Daun
Seeing the march turn southward at Troppau a light breaks on Daun Ha
coming round upon Bohemia from the east then That is Dauns opinion
for some time yet and he immediately starts that way to save a fine
magazine he has at Leutomischl over there Daun from Skalitz near
Konigsgratz where he is has but some eighty miles to march for the
Kings hundred and fifty and arrives in those parts few days after
the King posts himself at Leutomischl veiled in Pandours Not for two
weeks more does he ascertain it to have been a march upon the Olmutz
Country and the intricate forks of the Morawa River with a view to
besieging Olmutz by this wily Enemy Upon which Daun did strive
to bestir himself thitherward at last and though very slow and
hesitative his measures otherwise were unexceptionable and turned out
luckier than had been expected by some people

Olmutz is an ancient pleasant little City in the Plains of Mahren
romantic indistinct to the English mind with Domes with Steeples
eminent beyond its sizepopulation little above 10000 soulshas its
PrinceArchbishop and ecclesiastic outfittings with whom Friedrich
has lodged in his time City which trades in leather and Russian and
Moldavian droves of oxen Memorable to the Slavic populations for its
grand Czech Library which was carried away by the Swedes happily into
thick night To Stralsund 1645 and has not since been heard of
also for that poor little Wenzel of theirs last heir of the Bohemian
Czech royalties whom no reader has the least memory of being killed
on the streets hereuncertain to this day by whom though for whose
benefit that daggerstroke ended is certain enough Supra vol v p
118poor little Wenzels dust lies under that highest Dome of
the old Cathedral yonder if anybody thought of such a thing in hot
practical times Poor Lafayette too lodged here in prison when the
Austrians seized him City trades in leather and live stock we said
has much to do with artillery much with ecclesiastryand Friedrich
besieged it for seven weeks in the hot summer days of 1758 to no
purpose Friedrich has been in Olmiitz more than once before his
Schwerin once took it in a single day and it was his for months in the
old MoravianForay time but the place is changed now become an arsenal
or military storehouse of Austria strongly fortified and with a
Captain in it who distinguishes himself by valiant skill and activity
on this occasion

Friedrichs Olmutz Enterprise the rather as it was unsuccessful has
not wanted critics And certainly according to the ordinary rules of
cautious prudence could these have been Friedrichs in his present
situation it was not to be called a prudent Enterprise But had
Friedrichs arrangements been punctually fulfilled and Olmutz been got
in fair time as was possible or probable the thing might have been
done very well Duke Ferdinand in these early May days is practically
making preparations to follow the French across the Rhine no fear of
French Armies interfering with us this year Dohna has the Swedes locked
in Stralsund capable of being starved had not the thaw come and
in HinterPommern he has General Platen with a tolerable Detachment
watching Fermor and his Russians Dohna with Platen may entertain the
Russians for a little when they get on waywhich we know will be at a
slow pace and late in the season Prince Henri commands in Saxony say
with 30000Kings vicegerent and other self there Do YOUR wisest
and promptest hold no councils of war Prince Henri altogether on
the aggressive as yet is waiting what Reichs Army there may behas
already had Mayer and Free Corps careering about in Franken Country once
and again tearing up the incipiencies and preparations with the usual
emphasis and is himself intending to follow thither in a still more
impressive manner Friedrichs calculation is Prince Henri will have
his hands free for a good few weeks yet Which proved true enough so
far as that went

And now supposing Olmutz ours and Vienna itself open to our insults
does not by rapid suction every armed Austrian flow thitherward
Germany all drained of them in which case what is to hinder Prince
Henri from stepping into Bohmen by the Metal Mountains capturing Prag
getting into junction with us here and tumbling Austria at a rate
that will astonish her Her and her miscellaneous tagraggery of
Confederates one and all Konigsberg Stralsund Bamberg Russians
Swedes Reichsfolkhere in Mahren will be the crown of the game for
all these Prosper in Mahren all these are lamed one right stroke at
the heart the limbs become manageable quantities This was Friedrichs
program and had not imperfections of execution beyond what was looked
for and also a good deal of plain illluck intervened this bold
stroke for Mahren might have turned out far otherwise than it did

The march thither started from Neisse April 27th was beautiful
Friedrich with vanguard and first division Keith with rearguard and
second always at a days distance split into proper columns for
convenience of road and quarter in the hungry countries threading
those silent mountain villages and upper streamlets of Oder and Morawa
Ziethen waving intrusive Croateries far off Fouquet in thousands
of wagons shoving on from Neisse in four sections with the
due intervals under the due escorts the immensity of stores and
siegefurniture through Jagerndorf through Troppau and onwards
Table of his routes and stages in TEMPELHOF ii 46punctual
everybody besiegers and siege materials ready on their ground by the
set day Daun too had made speed to save his Magazine Daun was at
Leutomischl May 5tha forty miles to west of the Morawafew days
after Friedrich had arrived in those countries by the eastern or left
bank by Troppau Gibau Littau Aschmeritz Prossnitz and a week
before Friedrich had finished his reconnoitrings campings and taken
position to his mind Camps four or more shrank in the end to three
on both banks of the River a matter of abstruse study so that it was
May 12th before Friedrich first took view of Olmutz itself and could
fairly begin his ProblemDaun with his best Tolpatcheries still
unable to guess what it was

Of the Siege I propose to say little though the accounts of it are
ample useful to the Artillerist and Engineer If the reader can be
made to conceive it as a blazing loudsounding fact on which and on
Friedrich in it the eyes of all Europe were fixed for some weeks it
may rest now in impressive indistinctness to us Keith is Captain of the
Siege whom all praise for his punctual firmness of progress Balbi as
before is Engineer against whom goes the criticism Keiths first of
all that he opened his first parallel 800 yards too far offwhich
much increased the labor and the expenditure of useless gunpowder shot
having no effect at such a distance There were various criticisms some
real as this some imaginary as that Friedrich grudged gunpowder the
fact being that he had it not except after carriage from Neisse say a
hundred and twenty miles offTroppau his last Silesian Town or safe
place his for the moment is eighty milesand was obliged to waste
none of it

Friedrich is not thought to shine in the sieging line as he does in
the fighting which has some truth in it though not very much When
Friedrich laid himself to engineering I observe he did it well see
Neisse Graudenz Magdeburg His Balbi went wrong with the parallels on
this occasion many things went wrong but the truly grievous thing was
his distance from Silesia and the supplies A hundred and twenty
miles of hillcarriage eighty of them disputable for every shot of
ammunition and for every loaf of bread this was hard to standand
perhaps no Warapparatus but a Prussian with a Friedrich for sole
chiefmanager could have stood it so long Friedrich did stand it in
a wonderfully tolerable manner and was continuing to stand it and make
fair progress and it is not doubted he would have got Olmutz had
not there another fact come on him which proved to be of unmanageable
nature The actual loss namely of one Convoy after so many had
come safe and when as appears there was now only one wanted and no
moreLet us attend to this a little

Had Daun at Olmutz been as a Duke of Cumberland relieving Tournay
rushing into fight at Fontenoy like a Hanover WhiteHorse neck clothed
with thunder and head destitute of knowledgehow lucky had it been
for Friedrich But Daun knows his trade better Daun though superior
in strength sits on his Magazine clear not to fight By no art of
manoeuvring had Friedrich much tried it or hoped it this time could
Daun have been brought to give battle As Fabins Cunctator he is here in
his right place taking impregnable positions no man with better skill
in that branch of business pushing out parties on the Troppau road and
patiently waiting till this dangerous Enemy with such endless shifts in
him come in sight perhaps of his last cartridge or perhaps make
some stumble on the way towards that consummation Daun is aware of
Friedrichs surprising qualities Bos against Leo Daun feels these
procedures to be altogether feline FELISLEONINE such stealthy
glidings about deceptive motions appearances then such a rapidity of
spring upon you and with such a set of clawsdestructive to bovine
or rhinoceros nature in regard to all which Bos if he will prosper
surely cannot be too cautious It was remarked of Daun that he was
scrupulously careful never in the most impregnable situations
neglecting the least precaution but punctiliously fortifying himself to
the last item even to a ridiculous extent say Retzow and the critics
It was the one resource of Daun truly a solid stubborn patience is in
the man stubborn courage too of bovinerhinoceros typestupid
if you will but doing at all times honestly his best and his wisest
without flurry which character is often of surprising value in War
capable of much mischief now and then to quicker people Rhinoceros
Daun did play his Leo a bad prank more than once and this of barring
him out from Olmutz was one of them perhaps the worst after Kolin

Dauns management of this Olmutz business is by no means reckoned
brilliant even in the Fabius line but on the contrary inert
dimminded inconclusive and in reality till almost the very last he
had been of little help to the besieged For near three weeks till May
23d Daun sat at Leutomischl immovable on his breadbasket there forty
or more miles from Olmutz and did not see that a Siege was meant May
27th28th Balbi opened his first parallel in that mistaken way four
days before which Daun does move inwards a march or so to Zwittau
to Gewitsch still thirty miles to west of Olmutz still thinking
of Bohemia not of any siege still hanging by the mountains and the
breadbasket And thereabout Gewitsch siege or no siege Daun
sits down again pretty much immovable through the five weeks of
bombardment andexcept that Loudon and the Light Horse are very
diligent to do a mischief attempting our convoys more than once to
no purpose and alarming some of our outposts almost every night but
every night beaten offdoes in a manner nothing sits quiet behind
his impenetrable veil of Pandours and lets the bombardment take its
course Had not express Order come from Vienna on him it is thought
Daun would have sat till Olmutz was taken and would then have gone back
to Leutomischl and impregnable posts in the Hills On express order
heBut gather first these poor sparks in elucidation

The destructive sallies and the like at Olmutz were principally an
affair of the gazetteers and the imagination but it is certain Olmutz
this time was excellently well defended the Commandant a vigorous
skilful man prompt to seize advantages and Garrison and Townsfolk
zealously helping so that Friedrichs progress was unusually slow
Friedrichs feelings all this while and Balbis who spent his first
1220 shots entirely in vain beginning so far off may be judged
ofthe sound of him to Balbi sometimes stern enough As when June
9th he personally visits Balbis parallels top of the Tafelberg
yonder and inquires When do you calculate to get done then West
side of Olmutz and of the River east side lies mostly under water
there is the bombarding seventyone heavy guns Keith in his expertest
manner doing all the captaincies Keith has about 8000 of foot and
horse busy and vigilant with their faces to the east In a ring of
four camps or principally three Prossnitz Littau and Neustadt which
is across the River all looking westward or northwestward some ten
or twenty miles from Keith Friedrich headquarters oftenest Prossnitz
the chief camp stands facing Daun who lies concentric to him at the
distance of another ten or twenty miles in good part still thirty or
forty miles from Olmutz veiled mostly under a cloud of Pandours

Of Friedrichs impatiences we hear little though they must have been
great Prince Henri is ready for Prag many things are ready were
Olmutz but done May 22d Prince Henri had followed Mayer in person
with a stronger corps to root out the Reichsfolkand is now in
Bamberg City and Country And is even in Baireuth itself where was
lately the Camp of the new Reichs General Serene Highness of Zweibruck
and his nascent Reichs Army who are off bodily to Bohemia to Eger and

journeying towards death in fact and is probably the most pungent
sacredly tragic of Friedrichs sorrows now and onwards June 12th
Friedrichs pouting Brother the Prince of Prussia died this also he
had to hear in Camp at Olmutz What did he die of said Friedrich to
the Messenger a Major Something Of chagrin said the Major AUS
GRAM Friedrich made no answer

On the last night of May by beautiful management military and other
Duke Ferdinand is across the Rhine again chasing the French before him
who as they are far more numerous cannot surely but make some stand
so that a Battle there may be expected soonlet us hope a Victory
as indeed it beautifully proved to be three weeks after Battle of
Crefeld 23d June On the other hand Fermor and his Russians are
astir continually wending towards Brandenburg in their voluminous
manner since June 16th though at a slow rate How desirable the Siege
of Olmutz were done

On express from Vienna Daun did bestir himself cautiously got on foot
again detached across the River an expert Hussar General Be busy
all ye Loudons St Ignons Ziskowitzes doubly nowexpert Hussar
General one item of whose force is 1100 chosen grenadiersand
himself cautiously stept southward and eastward nearer the Siege Lines
The Hussar Generals meaning seemed to be some mischief on our Camp
of Neustadt and the outposts there but in reality it was to throw
his 1100 into Olmutz useful to the Commandant whichby ingenious
manoeuvring and guidance from the peasants through bushy woods and
bypaths on that east side of the Riverthe expert Hussar General
though Ziethen was sent over to handle him did perfectly manage and
would not quit for Ziethen till he saw it finished Which done Daun
keeps stepping still farther southward nearer the Siege Lines and at
Prossnitz morning of June 22d Friedrich with his own eyes sees Daun
taking post on the opposite heights says to somebody near him VOILA
LES AUTRICHIENS ILS APPRENNENT A MARCHER There are the Austrians they
are learning to march thoughgetting on their feet like infants in
a certain stage MARCHER having that meaning too though I know not
that the King intended itthey have learned a great many things
since your Majesty first met them Friedrich took Daun to be now at
last meaning Battle for Olmutz and made some slight arrangements
accordingly but that is not Dauns intention at all as Friedrich will
find to his cost in few days That very day Daun has vanished again
still in the southerly direction again under veil of Pandours

Meanwhile in spite of all things the Siege makes progress June
22d Balbis sap had got to their glacis and was pushing forward
thereJune 22d day when Daun made momentary appearance and the
reinforcement stole inwithin a fortnight more Balbi promises the
thing shall be done But supplies are indispensable one other convoy
from Troppau and let it be a big one between 3 and 4000 wagons
meal money iron powder Friedrich hopes this one if he can get it
home will suffice Colonel Mosel is to bring this Convoy a resolute
expert Officer with perhaps 7000 foot and horse surely sufficient
escort but as Daun is astir and his Loudons Ziskowitzes and
light people are gliding about Friedrich orders Ziethen to meet this
important Convoy with some thousands of new force and take charge of
bringing it in Mosel was to leave Troppau June 26th Ziethen pushes
out to meet him from the Olmutz end on the second day after and one
hopes all is now safe on that head

The driving of 3000 fourhorse wagons under escort ninety miles of
road is such an enterprise as cannot readily be conceived by sedentary
pacific readersmuch more the attack of such Military science
constraining chaos into the cosmic state has nowhere such a problem
There are twelve thousand horses for one thing to be shod geared
kept roadworthy and regular say six thousand country wagoners
thicksoled peasants then hanging to the skirts of these in
miscellaneous crazy vehicles and weak teams equine and asinine are one
or two thousand sutler people male and female not of select quality
though on them too we keep a sharp eye The series covers many miles
as many as twenty English miles says Tempelhof unless in favorable
points you compress them into five going four wagons abreast for
defences sake Defence or escort goes in three bulks or brigades
vanguard middle rearguard with sparse pickets interveningwider
than five miles you cannot get the parts to support one another An
enemy breaking in upon you at some difficult point of road woody
hollow or the like and opening cannon musketry and hussar exercise on
such an object must make a confused transaction of it Some commanders
for the road has hitherto been mainly pacific divide their train
into parts say four parts moving with their partial escorts with an
interval of one day between each two this has its obvious advantages
but depends of course on the road being little infested so that your
partial escort will suffice to repel attacks Toiling forward at their
diligent slow rate I find these trains from Troppau take about six
days from Neisse to Olmutz they take eleven but the first five are
peaceable Tempelhof ii 48cant be hurried beyond that pace if
you would save your laggards your irregulars and prevent what we may
call RAGGERY in your rearward parts the skirts of your procession get
torn by the bushes if you go faster This time Colonel Mosel will have
to mend his pace however and to go in the lump withal the case being
critical as Mosel knows and MORE than he yet knows

Daun who has friends everywhere and no lack of spies in this country
generally hears of the convoys He has heard in particular of this
important one in good time Hitherto Daun had not attempted much
upon convoys nor anything with success Kings posted corps and other
precautions are of such a kind not even Loudon when he tried his best
could do any good and common wandering hussar parties are as likely
to get a mischief as to do one on such service Cautious Daun had been
busy enough keeping his own Camp safe and flinging a word of news or
encouragement at the most a trifle of reinforcement into Olmutz when
possible But now it becomes evident there must be one of two things
this convoy seized or else a battle riskedand that in defect of both
these the inevitable third thing is Olmutz will straightway go

MajorGeneral Loudon the best partisan soldier extant and ripening
for better things has usually a force of perhaps 10000 under him
four regiments of them regular grenadiers and has been active on
the convoys though hitherto unsuccessful Let an active Loudon with
increased force try this their vitally important convoy from the west
side of the River an active Ziskowitz cooperating on the east side
where the road itself is and do their uttermost That is Dauns
plannow in course of execution Daun instead of meaning battle that
day when Friedrich saw him was cautiously stealing past intending to
cross the River farther down and himself support the operation Daun
has crossed accordingly and has doubled up northward again to the fit
point Ziskowitz is in the fit point in the due force on this east
side too Loudon on the west side goes by Muglitz Hof making a long
deep bend far to westward and hillward of all the Prussian posted corps
and precautions and altogether hidden from them Loudon aims to be in
Troppau neighborhood Guntersdorf near Bautsch by the proper day
and pay Mosel an unexpected visit in the passage there

Colonel Mosel marshalling his endless Trains with every excellent
precaution and the cleverest dispositions say the Books against
the known and the unknown had got upon the road and creaked forward
manywheeled out of Troppau Monday 26th June Tempelhof ii 8994
The roads worn by the much travelling and wet weather were utterly
bad the pace was perhaps quicker than usual the muchjolting Train got
greatly into a jumbleMosel to bring up the laggards made the morrow
a restday did get about twothirds of his laggards marshalled again
ordered the others to return as impossible They say had it not been
for this restday which seemed of no consequence Loudon would not have
been at Guntersdorf in time nor have attempted as he did at Guntersdorf
and afterwards At break of day Wednesday 28th Mosel is again on the
road heavily jumbling forward from his quarters in Bautsch Few
miles on towards Guntersdorf he discovers Loudon posted ahead in the
defiles What a sight for Mosel in his character of Wagoner up with
the dawn But Mosel managed the defiles and Loudon this time halted his
train dashed up into the woody heights and difficult grounds stormed
Loudons cannon from him smote Loudon in a valiant tempestuous manner
and sent him travelling again for the present

Loudon I conjecture would have struggled farther had not he known
that there would be a better chance again not very many miles ahead
London has studied this Convoy knows of Ziethen coming to it with so
many of Ziskowitz coming to him Loudon with so many that Ziethen
cannot send for more roads being all beset by our industry yesterday
that Ziskowitz can should it be needfuland that at Domstadtl there
is a defile or confused woody hollow of unequalled quality Mosel
jumbles on all day with his Train none molesting at night gets to his
appointed quarters Village of Neudorff The L or EL is a
diminutive in these Names NEUDORFL NewThorpLET DOMSTADTL
CathedralTownLET and the like and there finds Ziethen a glad
meeting we may fancy but an anxious one with Domstadtl ahead on
the morrow Loudon concerts with Ziskowitz this day calls in all
reinforcements possible and takes his measures Thursday morning
Ziethen finds the Train in such a state hardly half of it come up
he has to spend the whole day Mosel and he in rearranging it Friday
morning June 30th they get under way againFriday the catastrophe
is waiting them

The Pass of Domstadtl lapped in the dim Moravian distance is not known
to me or to my readers nor indeed could the human pen or intellect
aided by ocular inspection or whatever helps give the least image of
what now took place there rendering Domstadtl a memorable locality ever
since Understand that Ziethen and Mosel with their waste
slow deluge of wagons come jumbling in with anxiety with
precautionsprecautions doubled now that the woody intricacies about
Domstadtl rise in sight Pooh it is as we thought there go Austrian
cannonsalvos horsecharges volleying musketries as our first wagons
enter the Passand there will be a job Indecipherable to mankind far
off or even near Of which only this feature and that can be laid hold
of as discernible by the most industrious man Escort in three main
bodies vanguard middle rearguard marches on each side infantry on
the left cavalry on the right as the ground is leveller there Length
of the Train in statute miles as it jumbles along at this point is not
given but we know it was many miles that horses and wagoners were in
panic hardly restrainable and we dimly descry here especially human
drillsergeantcy doing the impossible to keep chaos plugged down The
poor wagoner cannon playing ahead whirls homeward with his vehicle if
your eye quit himstill better and handier cuts his traces mounts
in a good moment and is off at heavyfooted gallop leaving his wagon
Seldom had human drillsergeantcy such a problem

The Prussian Vanguard one Krockow its commander repulsed that first
Austrian attack swept the Bass clear for some minutes got their
section of the carriages or some part of it 250 in all hurried
through then halted on the safe side to wait what Ziethen would do
with the remainder Ziethen does his best and bravest as everybody
does keeps his wagonchaos plugged down ranks it in square mass as a
wagon fortress WAGENBURG ranks himself and everybody his cannon his
platoon musketry to the best advantage round it furiously shoots out
in all manner of ways against the furious Loudon on this flank and
the furious Ziskowitz on that takes hills loses them repels and is
repelled wagonchaos ever harder to keep plugged finally perceives
himself to be beaten that the wagonchaos has got unplugged fancy
itand that he Ziethen must retreat back foremost if possible He
did retreat fighting all the way to Troppau and the Convoy is a ruin
and a prey

Krockow with the 250 has got under way again hearing the
powderwagons start into the air fired by the enemy and hearing
the cannon and musketry take a northerly course and die away in
that ominous direction These 250 were all the carriages that came
inhappily by Ziethens prudence the money a large sum had been
lodged in the vanmost of these The rest of the Convoy ball powder
bread was of little value to Loudon but beyond value to Friedrich at
this moment and it has gone to annihilation and the belly of Chaos and
the Croats Among the tragic wrecks of this Convoy there is one that
still goes to our heart A longish almost straight row of young
Prussian recruits stretched among the slain what are these These were
700 recruits coming up from their cantons to the Wars hardly yet six
months in training see how they have fought to the death poor lads
and have honorably on the sudden got manumitted from the toils of
life Seven hundred of them stood to arms this morning some sixtyfive
will get back to Troppau that is the invoice account They lie there
with their blond young cheeks and light hair beautiful in deathcould
not have done better though the sacred poet has said nothing of them
hithertonor need till times mend with us and him Adieu my noble
young Brothers so brave so modest no Spartan nor no Roman more may
the silence be blessed to you

Contrary to some current notions it is comfortably evident that there
was a considerable fire of loyalty in the Prussians towards their King
during this War loyalty kept well under cover not wasting itself in
harangues or noisy froth but coming out among all ranks of men in
practical attempts to be of help in this high struggle which was their
own as well as his The STANDE landed Gentry of Pommern and other
places we heard of their poor little Navy of twelve gunboats which
were all taken by the Swedes Militia Regiments too which did good
service at Colberg as may transiently appear by and byin the gentry
or upper classes a respectable zeal for their King Then among the
peasantry or lower classHere are Seven Hundred who stood well where
he planted them And their MothersBe Spartan also ye Mothers In
peaceable times Tempelhof tells us the Prussian Mother is usually proud
of having her son in this Kings service a country wife will say
to you I have three of them all in the regiment Billerbeck
Itzenplitz or whatever be the Canton regiment the eldest is ten
inches stands five feet ten the second is eleven the third eight
for indeed he is yet young

Daun on the day of this Domstadtl business and by way of masking it
feeling how vital it was made various extensive movements across the
River by several Bridges then hither thither on the farther side
of Olmutz mazing up and down Friedrich observing him till he should
ripen to something definite followed his bombarding the while perhaps
having hopes of wager of battle ensuing Of the disaster at Domstadtl
Friedrich could know nothing Loudon having closed the roads Daun by
no means ripens into battle news of the disaster reached Friedrich next
day Saturday July 1stwho immediately assembled his Generals and
spoke a few inspiring words to them such as we may fancy Friedrich
perceives that Olmutz is over that his Third Campaign third lunge upon
the Enemys heart has prospered worse thus far than either of the
others that he must straightway end this of Olmutz without any success
whatever and try the remaining methods and resources No word of
complaint they say is heard from Friedrich in such cases face always
hopeful tone cheery A man in Friedrichs position needs a good deal of
Stoicism Greek or other

That Saturday night the Prussian bombardment is quite uncommonly
furious long continuing no night yet like itthe Prussians are
shooting off their superfluous ammunition this night do not quite
end till Sunday is in On Sunday itself packings preparations all
completed and Keith with above 4000 wagons safe on the road since
2 AMthe Prussians softly vanish in long smooth streams with music
playing unmolested by Daun and leaving nothing it is boasted but
five or three mortars which kept playing to the last and one cannon
to which something had happened

Of the retreat there could be much said instructive to military men
who were studious extremely fine retreat say all judgesof which
my readers crave only the outlines the results Daun it was thought
should have ruined Friedrich in this retreat but he did nothing of harm
to him In fact for a week he could not comprehend the phenomenon at
all and did not stir from his placewhich was on the other or wrong
side of the River Daun had never doubted but the retreat would be to
Silesia and he had made his detachments and laid himself out for doing
something upon it in that direction but lo what roads are these
what motions whitherward In about a week it becomes manifest that
the retreat which goes on various roads sometimes three at once has
converged on Leutomischl straight for Bohemia instead of Silesia and
that Daun is fallen seven days behind it incapable now to do anything
Not even the Magazine at Leutomischl could be got away nor could even
the whole of it be burnt

Keith and the baggage once safe in Leutomischl July 8th all goes in
deliberate long column Friedrich ahead to open the passages July 14th
after five more marches Friedrioh bursts up Konigsgratz scattering any
opposition there is and sits down there in a position considered he
knows well how inexpugnable to live on the Country and survey events
The 4000 baggagewagons came in about entire Fouquet had the first
division of them and a secondary charge of the whole an extremely
strict almost pedantic man and of very fiery temper HE DOU
VENEZVOUS asked he sharply of Retzow senior who had broken through
his order one day to avert great mischief How come you here MON
GENERAL By the Highway your Excellency answered Retzow in a grave
stiff tone Retzow i 302

Keith himself takes the rearguard the most ticklish post of all and
manages it well and with success as his wont is Under sickness at the
time but with his usual vigilance prudence energy qualities apt to
be successful in War Some brushes of Croat fighting he had from Loudon
but they did not amount to anything It was at Holitz within a march
of Konigsgratz that Loudon made his chief attempt a vehement
wellintended thing which looked well at one time But Keith heard the
cannonading ahead hurried up with new cavalry new sagacity and fire of
energy dashed out horsecharges seized hilltops of a vital nature
and quickly ended the affair A man fiery enough and prompt with his
stroke when wanted though commonly so quiet Tell Monsieursome
General who seemed too stupid or too languid on this occasionTell
Monsieur from me said Keith to his Aidedecamp he may be a very
pretty thing but he is not a man QUIL PEUT ETRE UNE BONNE CHOSE MAIS

in him one perceives He is now past sixty troubled with asthma and
I doubt not may be occasionally thinking it near time to end his
campaigns And in fact he is about ending them sooner than he or
anybody had expected

Daun picking his steps and positions latterly with threefold
precaution got into Konigsgratz neighborhood a week after Friedrich
and looked down with enigmatic wonder upon Friedrichs new settlement
there Forage abundant all round and the cornharvest growing
whitehere strange to say has Friedrich got planted in the inside of
those innumerable Daun redoubts and woods of abatis and might make
a very pretty Bohemian Campaign of it after all were Daun the
only adversary he had Judges are of opinion that Daun with all his
superiority of number could not have disrooted Friedrich this season

as too often elsewhere does not give us the Arithmetical Numbers of
each but counts by Battalions and Squadrons which except in
time of Peace are a totally uncertain quantityguess vaguely 75000
against 30000 Daun did try him by the Pandour methods 1000 Croats
stealing in upon Konigsgratz at one in the morning and the like but
these availed nothing By the one effectual method that of beating
him in battle Daun never would have tried What did disroot Friedrich
thenTake the following dates and small hints of phenomena in other

KONITZ 16th JUNE 1758 This day Feldmarschall Fermor arrives in his
principal Camp here For many weeks past he has been dribbling across
the Weichsel hitherward into various small camps with Cossack Parties
flying about under check of General Platen But now being all across
and reunited Fermor shoots out Cossack Parties of quite other weight
and atrocity and is ready to begin businessstill a little uncertain
how His Cossacks under their Demikows Romanzows capable of no good
fighting but of endless incendiary mischief in the neighborhoodshoot
far ahead into Prussian territory Platen Hordt with his FreeCorps

TSCHOPAU in Saxony 21st JUNE Prince Henri has quitted Bamberg
Country and is home again carefully posted at Tschopau and up and
down on the southern side of Saxony with his eye well on the Passes
of the Metal Mountainswhere now in the turn things at Olmutz have
taken his clear fate is to be invaded NOT to invade The Reichs Army
fairly afoot in the Circle of Saatz counts itself 35000 add 15000
Austrians of a solid quality there is a Reichs Army of 50000 in all

CREFELD Rhine Country 23d JUNE Duke Ferdinand after skilful
shoving and advancing some forty or fifty miles on his new or French
side of the Rhine finds the French drawn up at Crefeld June
23d 47000 of them VERSUS 33000 in altogether intricate ground
canalditches osierthickets farmvillages peatbogs Ground
defensible against the world had the 47000 had a Captain but
reasonably safe to attack with nothing but a Clermont acting that
character Ferdinand I can perceive knew his Clermont and took
liberties with him Divided himself into three attacks one in front
one on Clermonts right flank both of which cannonaded as if in
earnest but did not prevent Clermont going to dinner One attack on
front one on right flank then there was a third seemingly on left
flank but which winded itself round perilously imprudent had there
been a Captain instead of a Clermont deepish in wine by this time and
burst in upon Clermonts rear jingling his wineglasses and decanters
think at what a ratescattering his 47000 and him to the road again

Ferdinand it was hoped would now be able to maintain himself and push
forward on this French side of the Rhine and had Wesel been his as
some of us know it is not perhaps he might At any rate veteran

LOUISBURG North America JULY 8th Landing of General Amhersts
people at Louisburg in Cape Breton with a view of besieging that
important place Which has now become extremely difficult the garrison
and their defences military naval being in full readiness for such an
event Landing was done by Brigadier Wolfe under the eye of Amherst and
Admiral Boscawen from rearward and under abundant fire of batteries and
musketries playing on it ahead in one of the surfiest seas but we have
waited four days and it hardly mends tossing us about like corksso
that many of the boats were broken and Wolfe and people had to leap
out breastdeep and make fight for themselves the faster the better
under very intricate circumstances Which was victoriously done by
Wolfe and his people really in a rather handsome manner that morning
As were all the subsequent Siegeoperations on land and on water by
them and the otherstill August 8th the Siege ended in complete
surrenderpositively for the last time Pitt fully intends no
Austrian Netherlands now to put one on revoking it General Amhersts
DIARY OF THE SIEGE in _Gentlemans Magazine_ xxviii 384389

These are pretty victories cheering to Pitt and Friedrich but the
difficult point still is that of Fermor Whose Cossacks and their
devillike ravagings are hideous to think ofunrestrainable by Dohna
unless he could cut the root of them which he cannot JUNE 27th while
Colonel Mosel with his 3000 wagons still only one stage from Troppau
was so busy slow Fermor rose from Konitz began hitching southward
southward gradually to Posena considerably stronger Polish Town
on the edge both of Brandenburg and of Silesiaand has been sitting
there almost ever since our entrance into Bohemia his Cossacks burning
and wasting to great distances in both Countries no deciding which of
them he meant to invade with his main Army Sits there almost a month
enigmatic to Dohna enigmatic to Friedrich till Friedrich decides at
last that he cannot be suffered longer whichever of them he mean and
rises for Silesia August 2d Precisely about which day Fermor had
decided for Brandenburg and rolled over thither towards Custrin and
the FrankfurtonOder Country heralded by fire and murder as usual

Friedrichs march to Landshut is again much admired Daun had beset
the three great roads the two likeliest especially with abundant
Pandours and his best Loudons and St Ignons Friedrich making himself
enigmatic to Daun struck into the third road by Skalitz Nachod
circuitous steep but lying Glatzward handy for support of various
kinds He was attempted once or more by Pandours but used them badly
fell in with Dauns old abatis well winddried now in different
places and burnt them in passing And in five days was in
KlosterGrussau safe on his own side of the Mountains again One point
only we will note in these Pandour turmoilings From Skalitz the first
stage of his march he answers a Letter of Brother Henris

TO PRINCE HENRI at Tachopau in Saxony What you write to me of my
Sister of Baireuth that she has been in extremity cannot yet write
and must not be told of the Prince of Prussias death lest it kill

tenderly loved in this world She is a Sister who has my heart and all
my confidence and whose character is of price beyond all the crowns in
this universe From my tenderest years I was brought up with her
you can conceive how there reigns between us that indissoluble bond of
mutual affection and attachment for life which in all other cases were

Chapter XIIIBATTLE OF ZORNDORF

Sunday 20th August Friedrich with his small Army hardly above 15000
I should guess arrived at FrankfurtonOder his Majesty it seems
lodged in the Lebus Suburb in the house of a Clergymans Widow and
was observed to go often out of doors and listen to the cannonading
which was going on at Custrin Rodenbeck i 347 From Landshut
hither he has come in nine days the swiftest marching a fiery spur
of indignation being upon all his men and him for the last two days
fierier than everlonging all to have a blow at those incendiary
Russian gentlemen Five days ago the Russians attempting blindly
on the Garrison of Custrin had burntnothing of the Garrison at
allbut the poor little Town altogether Which has filled everybody
with lamentation and horror And listen yonder they are still busy on
the solitary Garrison of Custrinaudible enough to Friedrich from his
northern or Lebus Suburb which lies nearest the place at a distance of
some twenty miles

Of Fermors redhot savagery on Custrin it is lamentably necessary we
should say something to say much would he a waste of record as the
thing itself was a waste of powder A thing hideous to think of without
the least profit to Fermor but with total ruin to all the inhabitants
and to the many strangers who had sought refuge there One interior
circumstance is memorable and lucky to us ArtilleryCaptain Tielcke
happened to be with these people had come in the train of two Saxon
Princes serving as volunteers and with a singular lucidity and
faithful good sense not scientific alone he illuminates these black
Russian matters for such as have to do with them

Tielckes Book of _Contributions to the Art of War_ _Beytrage zur
KriegeKunst und ZUR Geschichte des Krieges von 1756 bis 1763_ six
thin vols 4to with many Plates cited above is still in repute with
Soldiers especially in the Artillery line and indeed shows a sound
geometrical head and contains bits of excellent Historical reading
interspersed among the scientific parts This Tielcke it appears was
a common footsoldier one of those Pirna 14000 made Prussian against
their will but Tielcke had a milkmaid for sweetheart in those regions
who good soul gave him her generous farewell a suit of her clothes
perhaps a pair of her pails and in that guise he walked out of bondage
Clear away to Warsaw to favor with the King and others being of
real merit an excellent studious modest little man and here he
now reappears in a higher capacity as articulate Eyewitness of the
Custrin Business and the Zorndorf among much other Russian darkness
which shall remain comfortably blank to us

Up to Custrin the Journal of the Operations of the Russian Army which
I could give from day to day TAGEBUCH BEYDER c Diary of both
Armies from the beginning of the Campaign till Zorndorf in Tielcke

c is of no interest except to the Nether Powers of this Universe the
Russian Operations hitherto having consisted in slow marches sluttish
cookeries cantonings bivouackings with destruction of a poor innocent
Country and arson theft and murder done on the great scale by inhuman
vagabonds Cossacks so called not tempered on this occasion by the
mercy of Calmucks The regular Russian Army it appears participates
in the common horror of mankind against such a method of making war but
neither Feldmarschall Fermor nor General Demikof properly THEMICOUD a
Swiss deserving little thanks from us who has taken in hand to command
these Missionaries of the Pit can help the results above described
Which are justly characterized as abominable to gods and men and
not fit to be recorded in human Annals execration and if it were
possible oblivion being the human resource with them The Russian
Officers it seems despise this Cossack rabble incredibly for their
fighting qualities withal are close on zero though their talent for
arson and murder is so considerable And contrariwise the Cossacks for
their part have no objection to plunder or even if obstreperous
to kill any regular Officer they may meet unescorted in a good place
Their talent for arson is great They do uncountable damage to the Army
itself provoking all the Country people to destroy by fire what could
be eaten or used the foraging food and equipments of horse and man
so that horse and man have to be fed by victual carted hundreds of miles
out of Poland and the Russian Army sticks as it were tethered with a
welter of broken porridgepots and rent mealbags hung to every foot it
has

East Preussen is quiet from the storms of War holds its tongue well
and hopes better days but the Russians themselves are little the better
for it a country so lately burned bare they are merely flung so many
scores of miles forward farther from home and their real resources
before they can begin work They have no port on the Baltic poor
blockheads they are aware how desirable for instance Dantzig would
be to help feeding them out of ships but the Dantzigers wont
Colberg a poor little place with only 700 militia people in it would
be of immense service to them as a seahaven but even this they have
not yet tried to get and after trying they will find it a job Why
not unite with the Swedes and take Stettin the finest harbor in the
Baltic which would bring Russia by ships to your very hand This
is what Montalembert is urgent upon year after year to the point
of wearying everybody but he can get no official soul to pay heed to
himthe difficulties are so considerable Swedes what are they say
the Russians Russians what say the Swedes Sweden would be so handy
for the Artilleries urges Montalembert Russians for the Soldiery
or covering and fighting partCant be done Officiality shakes its
head and Montalembert is obliged to be silent

The Russians have got into the Neumark of Brandenburg on those bad
terms and are clearly aware that without some Fortress as a Place of
Arms they are an overgrown Incompetency and Monstrosity in the field
of War doing much destruction most of which proves selfdestructive
before long But how help it If the carrying of meal so far be
difficult what will the carrying of siegefurniture be A flat
impossibility Fermor aware of these facts remembers what happened at
Oczakowlong ago in our presence and Keiths and Munnichs if the
reader have not quite forgot Munnich on that occasion took Oczakow
without any siegefurniture whatever by boldly marching up to it
nothing but audacity and good luck on his side Fermor determines to
try Custrin in the like wayif peradventure Prussian soldiery be like
Turk

Fermor rose from Posen August 2d almost three weeks ago making daily
for the Neumark and those unfortunate Oder Countries nobody but Dohna
to oppose himDohna in the ratio of perhaps one against four Dohna
naturally laid hold of Frankfurt and the Oder Bridge so that Fermor
could not cross there whereupon Fermor as the next best thing struck
northward for the Warta black Polish stream last big branch of Oder
crossed this at his ease by Landsberg Bridge August 10th Tempelhof
ii 216 and after a day or two of readjustment in Landsberg made for
Custrin Country his next headquarter is at Gross Kamin hoping in
some accidental or miraculous way to cross Oder thereabouts or even get
hold of Custrin as a Place of Arms If peradventure he can take Custrin
without proper siegeartillery in the Oczakow or AntiTurk way Fermor
has been busy upon Custrin since August 15thin what fashion we partly
heard and will now from authentic sources see a little for ourselves

The Castle of Custrin built by good Johann of Custrin and roofed
with copper in the Reformation timeswe know it from of old and
Friedrich has since had some knowledge of it Custrin itself is a rugged
little Town with some moorland traffic and is still a place of great
military strength the garrison of those parts Its rough pavements
its heavy stone battlements and barriers give it a guarled obstinate
aspectstern enough place of exile for a CrownPrince fallen into such
disfavor with Papa A rugged compact by no means handsome little Town
at the meeting of the Warta and the Oder stands naturally among sedges
willows and drained mire except that human industry is pleasantly busy
upon it and has long been So that the neighborhood is populous beyond
expectation studded with rough cottages in whitewash hamlets in a
paved condition and comfortable signs of labor victoriously wrestling
with the wilderness Custrin an arsenal and garrison begirt with two
rivers and with awful bulwarks and bastions cased in stoneperhaps
too high say the learnedis likely to be impregnable to Russian
engineering on those terms Here with brevity is the catastrophe of
Custrin

TUESDAY 15th AUGUST 1758 At two in the morning several thousand
Russians grenadiers under Quartermaster General Stoffeln whom the
readers of Mannstein know from old Oczakow times are astir pushing
along from Gross Kamin through the scraggy firwoods and flat peat
countries intending a stroke on Custrin if perhaps they can get it
Tempelhof ii 217 but Tielcke ii 69 et seq the real sourcenot
the slightest chance to get Custrin Prussian soldiership and Turkish
being two quite different things The pickeering and manoeuvring of
Stoffeln shall not detain us Stoffeln came along by the Landsberg
road course of the now KonigsbergCustrin Railway and drove in the
Prussian outparties who at first took him for Cossacks Stoffeln set
himself down on the north side of the place planted cannon in certain
claypits thereabouts and about nine oclock began firing shells and
incendiary grenadoes at a great rate Tielcke saw everythingand had
the honor to take luncheon that evening with certain chief Officers
sitting on the ground after all was over and only a few shots from the
Garrison still dropping Tielcke ii 75 n

At the third grenade which it seems fell into a straw magazine
Custrin took fire could not be quenched again so much dry wood in it
so much disorder too the very soldiers some of them disorderly a bad
deserter set so that it soon flamed aloftfrom side to side one sea
of flame and man woman and child every soul except the Garrison
which sat enclosed in strong stone had to fly across the River under
penalty of death by fire Of Custrin by five in the evening there was
nothing left but the black ashes the Garrison standing unharmed and
the Church Schoolhouse and some stone edifices in a charred skeleton
condition No life was lost except that of one child in arms All
Neumark had lodged its valuables in this place of strength all are fled
now in horror and terror across the Oder by the Bridge before it also
unquenchably takes fire at the western or nonRussian end of the place
Such a day as was seldom seen in human experienceFermor responsible
for it happily not we

Fermor in the evening said to his Artillery People Why have you
ceased to fire grenadoes Excellency the Town is out nothing now but
ashes and stone Never mind give them the rest one every quarter
of an hour We shall not need the grenadoes again The cannonballs we
shall them therefore do not waste On the morrow morning after
this performance on the Town Fermor sends a Trumpeter Surrender
or else rather in the tremendous style Or else answers the
Commandant pointing to the ashes to the black inconsumable stones and
is deaf to this EXPOSTFACTO Trumpeter The Russians say they sent
one yesterday morning not EXPOSTFACTO but he was killed in the
pickeerings and never heard of again A mile or so to rear of Custrin
on the westward or Berlin side of the River lies Dohna for the last
four days expecting that the Laws of Nature will hold good and Custrin
prove tenable against such sieging So stands it on Friedrichs arrival

We left Friedrich in the Lebus Suburb of Frankfurt Sunday August 20th
listening to the distant cannonade Next morning he is here himself
at Dohnas Camp of Gorgast taking survey of affairs came early under
rapid small escort leaving his Army to follow scorn and contemptuous
indignation the humor of him they say resolution to be swiftly home
upon that surprising Russian armament and teach it new manners The
black skeleton of Custrin stares hideously across the River Custrin
Siege so called still going onhad better make despatch now and take
itself away He greatly despises Russian soldiership Pooh pooh he
would answer if Keith from experience said Your Majesty does not do
it justiceand Keith has been known to hint If the trial ever come
your Majesty will alter that opinion A day or two hence amid these
hideous Russian firetraceries the Hussars bring him a dozen of
Cossacks they have made prisoners Friedrich looks at the dirty green
vagabonds says to one of his Staff And this is the kind of Doggery I
have to bother withThe sight of the poor countrypeople and their
tears of joy and of sorrow on his reappearance among them much affected
him Taking inspection of Dohna he finds Dohna wonderfully clean
pipeclayed complete You are very fine indeed youI bring you
a set of fellows rough as GRASTEUFELN grassdevils I never know
whether insects or birds but they can bitehope you can

Tuesday August 32d at five in the morning our Army has all arrived
the Frankfurt people just come in 30000 of us now in Camp at Gorgast
Friedrich orders straightway that a certain Russian Redoubt on the other
side of the River at Schaumburg a mile or two down stream be well
cannonaded into ruinas if he took it for some incipiency of a Russian
Bridge or were himself minded to cross here under cover of Custrin
Friedrichs intention very certainly is to crosshere or not just
hereand that same night after some hours of rest to the Frankfurt
peoplenight of TuesdayWednesday Friedrich having persuaded the
Russians that his crossingplace will be their Redoubt at Schaumburg
marches ten or twelve miles down the River silently his 30000 and
he till opposite the Village of Gustebiese rapidly makes his Bridges
there unmolested Fermor with his eye on the cannonaded Redoubt only
has expected no such matter and is much astonished when he hears of
it twenty hours after Friedrich across with the vanguard at an early
hour of Wednesday gets upon the knoll at Gustebiese for a view and
all Gustebiese hearing of him hurries out with lowvoiced tremulous
blessings irrepressible tears God reward your Majesty that have
come to usand there is a hustling and a struggling among the women
especially to kiss the skirts of his coat Poor souls one could have
stood tremendous cheers but this is a thing I forgive Friedrich for
being visibly affected with

Friedrich leaves his baggage on the other side of the Oder and the
Bridge guarded our friend Hordt with his FreeCorps doing it
Friedrich marches forward some ten miles that night eastward straight
for Gross Kamin as if to take the Russians in rear encamps at a place
called Klossow spreading himself obliquely towards the Mutzel black
sluggish tributary of the Oder in those parts meaning to reach Neu
Damm on the Mutzel tomorrow there almost within wind of the Russians
and be ready for crossing on them It was at Klossow 23d August
evening that the Hussars brought in their dozen or two of Cossacks
and he had his first sight of Russian soldiery by no means a favorable
one Ugh only lookAs we are now approaching Zorndorf and the
monstrous tug of Battle which fell out there readers will be glad of
the following

From Damm on the Mutzel where Friedrich intends crossing it tomorrow
night south to Gross Kamin not far from the Warta where Fermors
headquarter lately was may be about five miles From Custrin Kamin
lies northeast about eight or ten miles Zorndorf the most considerable
Village in this tract lieslittle dreaming of the sad glory coming to
itpretty much in the centre between big Warta and smaller Mutzel The
Country is by nature a peat wilderness far and wide but it has been
tamed extensively grows crops green pastures is elsewhere covered
with wood Scotch fir scraggy in size but evidently under forest
management perhaps half the country is in Fir tracts what they call
HEIDEN Heaths the cultivated spaces lying like lightgreen islands
with blackgreen channels and expanses of circumambient Fir The Drewitz
Heath the Massin or Zither Heath and others about Zorndorf will
become notable to us The Country is now much drier than in Friedrichs
time the human spade doing its duty everywhere so that much of the
Battleground has become irrecognizable when compared with the old
marshy descriptions given of it Zorndorf a rough substantial Hamlet
has nothing of boggy now visible near by lies east to west a firm
broad highway leading through a sea of forest before it to south to
north good dry barleygrounds or ryegrounds sensibly rising for
half a mile then waving about in various slow slight changes of level
towards Quartschen Zicher c forming an irregular cleared
island altogether of perhaps four miles by three with unlimited
circumambiencies of wood It was here on this island as we call it
that the Battle which has made Zorndorf famous was fought

Zorndorf or even the open ground half a mile to north of it which
will be more important to us is probably not 50 feet above the level of
the Mutzel nor 100 above Warta and Oder six miles off but it is the
crown of the Countrythe ground dropping therefrom every way in
lazy dull waves or swells towards Tamsel and Gross Kamin on southeast
towards BirkenBusch Quartschen Darmutzel DAR of the Mutzel whatever
DAR may be on northwest as well as towards Damm and its Bridge
northeast where Friedrich will soon be and towards Custrin southwest
where he lately was each a five or six miles from Zorndorf

Such is the poor moorland tract of Country Zorndorf the centre of
itwhere the battle is likely to beZorndorf and environs a bare
quasiisland among these woods extensive bald crown of the landscape
girt with a frizzle of firwoods all round Boggy pools there are
especially on the western side all drained in our time Mutzel or
north side is of course the lowest in level and accordingly what is
much to be marked by readers here from the south or Zorndorf side
at wide intervals there saunter along in a slow obscure manner Three
miserable continuous Leakages or oozy Threads of Water all making for
Quartschen to north or northwest there to disembogue into the Mutzel
Each of these has its little Hollow of which the westernmost called
Zabern Hollow ZABERNGRUND is the most considerable and the most
important to us here GALGENGRUND GallowsHollow is also worth naming
in this Battle the third Leakage though without importance invites us
to name it HOSEBRUCH quasi STOCKINGquagmirebecause you can use no
stockings there except with manifest disadvantageTake this other
concluding trait

 Inexpressible fringe of marsh two or three miles broad mostly
bottomless woven with sluggish creeks and stagnant pools borders the
Warta for many miles towards Landsberg CustrinLandsberg Causeway the
alone sure footing in it after which the country rises insensibly but
most beneficially and is mainly drier till you get to the Mutzel again
and find the same fringe of mud lacework again Zorndorf we called the
crown of it Tamsel Wilkersdorf Klein Kamin Gross Kamin and other
places known to us lie on the dry turffuel country but looking over
close upon the hem of that marshfringe and no doubt getting peats
wild ducks pikefishes eels and snatches of summer pasture and
cowhay out of it

Thursday August 24th Friedrich is again speeding on occupying
Darmutzel and other crossingplaces of the Mutzel Mitchell to
Holderness DErmItzel 24th August 1758 MEMOIRS AND PAPERS i
425 Ib ii 4047 Mitchells Private Journalby no means himself
crossing there on the contrary carefully breaking all the Bridges
before he go No retreat for those Russian vagabonds only death or
surrender for themhimself not intending to cross till he be up at
Damm Neu Damm well eastward of his Russians and have got them all
pinfolded between Mutzel and Oder in that way In the evening he
reaches Damm and the Mill of Damm some three or four miles higher up
the Mutzeland there pushes partly across at once That is to say
his vanguard at once and takes a defensive position his Artillery
and other Divisions by degrees in the silent night hours and before
daybreak tomorrow every soul will be across and the Bridge broken
againand Fermor had better have his accounts settled

Fermors roving Cossack clouds seldom bring him in intelligence but
only return stained with charcoal grime and red murder up to late last
night he had not known where Friedrich was at all had idly thought him
busy with the Schaumburg Redoubt on the other side of Oder fencing
and precautioning but now night of the 23d these Cossacks do come in
with news Indisputable to our poor minds the Prussians are at Klossow
yondercaptured a dozen green vagabonds of us and have sent
us gallopingwhich news with the night closing in on him was
astonishing thrice and four times important to Fermor

Instantly he raises the siege of Custrin any siege there was gets his
immense baggagetrain shoved off that night to Klein Kamin Landsberg
way summons the force from Landsberg to join him without loss of a
momentand in the meanwhile pitches himself in long bivouac in the
Drewitz Wood or FirHeath with the quaggy Zaberngrund in front Quaggy
Zaberngrunddo readers remember it one of those Three continuous
Leakages very important to Fermor and us at present This is the
safest place Fermor can find for himself scraggy firs around good
quagmires and Zabern Hollow in front looking to the east waiting what
a new day will bring That was Fermors posture while Friedrich quitted
Klossow in the dawn of the 24th Be busy ye Cossack doggeries return
with news not with mere grime and marks of blood on your mouths

Evening of the 24th Cossacks report that Friedrich has got to Damm
Mill has hold of the Bridge there and may be looked for sure as the
daylight tomorrow Fermor is 50000 odd his Landsberg forces all
coming in one Detachment out Stettin way which cannot come in Fermor
finds that his baggagetrain is fairly on the road to Klein Kaminand
that he will have to quit this bosky bivouac and fight for himself in
the open ground or do worse




THESEUS AND THE MINOTAUR OVER AGAINTHAT IS TO SAY FRIEDRICH AT
HANDGRIPS WITH FERMOR AND HIS RUSSIANS 25TH AUGUST 1758

Artless Fermor draws out to the open ground north of Zorndorf south
of Quartschen arranges himself in huge quadrilateral mass with his
staffbaggage lighter baggage in the centre and his front so
to speak everywhere Excellent Plan of him or rather Plans in his
successive shapes in Tielcke ii PLATES 4 5 6 7 8 Mass say
two miles long by one mile broad but it is by no means regular and has
many zigzags according to the ground and narrows and droops southward
on the eastern end one of the most artless arrangements but known to
Fermor and the readiest on this pinch of time Munnich devised this
quadrilateral mode and found it good against the Turks and their
deluges of raging horse and foot Fermor could perhaps do better but
there is such a press of hurry Fermors western flank or biggest
breadth of quadrilateral leans on that Zabern Hollow with its fine
quagmires his eastern narrowest part droops down on certain mudpools
and conveniences towards Zicher Gallows Hollow a slighter than the
Zabern runs through the centre of him and with his best people he
fronts towards the Mutzel Bridges especially towards DammMill Bridge
whence Friedrich will emerge sure as the sunrise one knows not with
what issue Artless Fermor is nothing daunted nor are his people
but stand patiently under arms regardless of future and present to a
degree not common in soldiering

Friday August 25th by halfpast three in the morning Friedrich is
across the Mutzel self and Infantry by DammMutzel Bridge cavalry by
another Bridge KERSTENBRUGGE means Christian Bridge in the dialect
of Charlemagnes time a very old arrangement of Successive Logs up
there some furlongs higher up The Bridge at Damm is perhaps some
three miles from the nearest Russians about Zicher but Friedrich has
no thought of attacking Fermor there he has a quite other program
laid and will attack Fermor precisely on the side opposite to there
Friedrichs intention is to sweep quite round this monstrous Russian
quadrilateral to break in upon it on the western flank and hurl it
back upon Mutzel and its quagmires He has broken his two bridges after
passing all bridges are gone there and the country is bottomless
surrender at discretion if once you are driven thither And Friedrichs
own retreat if he fail is short and open to Custrin Admirable say
the Critics and altogether in Friedrichs styleFriedrich adds
one Critic was not aware that the Russian HeavyBaggage Train which
is their powderflask and breadbasket and staff of life lies at Klein
Kamin within few miles on his left just now Russians themselves on his
right that the Russians could have been abolished from those countries
without fighting at all Retzow i 305329 This is very true
Friedrichs haste is great his humor hot and he has not heard of this
KleinKamin fact which in common times he would have done and of which
in a calmer mood he would with a fine scientific gusto have taken his
advantage

Friedrich pours incessant southward cavalry parallel to infantry and
a certain distance beyond it eastward of it and they have burnt the
Bridges which is a curious fact Continually southward as if for
Tamselpoor old Tamsel do readers recollect it at all does Friedrich
at all No pleasant dinner or lilyandrose complexions there for
one todaySome distance short of Tamsel Friedrich emerging turns
westwardintending what on earth thinks Fermor Friedrich has been
mostly hidden by the woods all this while and enigmatic to Fermor
Fermor does now at last see the color of the factsand that ones
chief front must change itself to southward ones best leg and arm
be foremost or towards Zorndorf not towards the Mutzel as hitherto
Fermor stirs up his Quadrilateral makes the required change You best
or northern line step across and front southward across to southward
I say secondbest go northward in their stead and so with some other
slight polishings suggested by the ground and phenomena we anew await
this Prussian Enigma with our best leg foremost The march or circular
sweep of these Prussian lines from Damm Bridge through the woods and
champaign to their appointed place of action is seven or eight miles
lines when halted in battleorder will be two miles long or more

Friedrich pours steadily along horse and foot by the rear cf
Wilkersdorf of ZorndorfRussian Minotaur scrutinizing him in that
manner with dull bloodshot eyes uncertain what he will do It is eight
in the morning hot August wind a mere lull but southernly if any
Small Hussar pickets ride to right of the main Army March to keep the
Cossacks in check who are roving about all on wing and pert enough
in spite of the Hussar pickets Desperado individuals of them gallop up
to the Infantry ranks and fire off their pistols therewithout reply
reply or firing till the word come is strictly forbidden Infantry
pours along like a ploughman drawing his furrow heedless of the
circling crows Crows or Cossacks finding they are not regarded set
fire to Zorndorf and gallop off Zorndorf goes up readily mainly
wood and straw rolls in big clouds of smoke far northward in upon the
Russian Minotaur making him still blinder in the important moments now
coming

Friedrich rides up to view the Zabern Hollow Beyond expectation deep
very boggy too with its foul leakage or brook no attacking of their
western flank through this Zaberngrundattack the corner of them
then here on the southwest That is Friedrichs rapid resource The
lines halt accordingly make ready Behind flaming Zorndorf stands his
extreme left which is to make the attack infantry in front horse to
rear and farther leftwardsand under the command of Seidlitz in this
quarter which is an important circumstance Right wing reaching to
behind Wilkersdorf is to refuse itself whole force of centre is
to push upon that Russian corner to support the left in doing
itaccording to the Leuthen or LEUCTRA principle once more May no
mistakes occur in executing it this day

The first division of the Prussian Infantry or extreme Left marches
forward by the west end of flaming Zorndorf next division which should
stand close to right of it or even behind it in action and follow it
close into the Russian fire has to march by the east end of Zorndorf
this is a farther road owing to the flames and not a lucky one Second
division could never get into fair contact with that first division
again that was the mistake and it might have been fatal but was not
as we shall see First division has got clear of Zorndorf in advancing
towards its Russian businessis striding forward its left flank safe
against the Zaberngrund steadily by fixed stages against the fated
Russian Corner which is its point of attack First division second
division are clear of Zorndorf though with a wide gap between them
are steadily striding forward towards the Russian Corner Two strong
batteries wide apart have planted themselves ahead and are playing
upon the Russian Quadrilateral their fires crossing at the due Corner
yonder with terrible effect Russian artillery which are multitudinous
and all gathered down to this southwestern corner are responding
though with their fire spread and far less effectual The Prussian line
steps on extreme left perhaps in too animated a manner their cannon
batteries enfilade the thick mass of Russians at a frightful rate
fortytwo men of a certain regiment blown away by a single ball in
one instance Tielcke drive the interior baggagehorses to despair
a very agitated Quadrilateral under its grim canopy of cannon
smoke and of straw smoke heaped on it from the Zorndorf side here
Manteuffel leader of that first or leftmost division sees the internal
simmering steps forward still more briskly to firing distance begins
his platoon thunder with the due steady furyhad the second division
but got up to support Manteuffel The second division is in fire too
but not close to Manteuffel where it should be

Fermor notices the gap the wavering of Manteuffel unsupported plunges
out in immense torrent horse and foot into the gap into Manteuffels
flank and front hurls Manteuffel back who has no support at hand
ARAH ARAH Hurrah Hurrah Victory Victory shout the Russians
plunging wildly forward sweeping all before them capturing twentysix
pieces of cannon for one item What a moment for Friedrich looking on
it from some knoll somewhere near Zorndorf I suppose hastily bidding
Seidlitz strike in Seidlitz now The hurrahing Russians cannot keep
rank at that rate of going like a buffalo stampede but fall into heaps
and gaps Seidlitz with a swiftness with a dexterity beyond praise
has picked his way across that quaggy Zabern Hollow falls with say
5000 horse on the flank of this big buffalo stampede tumbles it into
instant ruinwhich proves irretrievable as the Prussian Infantry come
on again and back Seidlitz

In fifteen minutes more I guess it now to be ten oclock the Russian
Minotaur this end of it on to the Gallows Ground is one wild mass
Seldom was there seen such a charge issuing in such deluges of wreck
of chaotic flight or chaotic refusal to fly The Seidlitz cavalry went
sabring till for very fatigue they gave it up and could no more The
Russian horse fled to KutzdorfFermor with them who saw no more of
this Fight and did not get back till darkhad not the Bridges been
burnt and no crossing of the Mutzel possible Fermor never would have
come back and here had been the end of Zorndorf Luckier if it had
But there is no crossing of the Mutzel there is only drowning in the
quagmires theredeath any way what can be done but die

The Russian infantry stand to be sabred in the above manner as if
they had been dead oxen More remote from Seidlitz they break open
the sutlers brandycasks and in few minutes get roaring drunk Their
officers desperate split the brandycasks soldiers flap down to drink
it from the puddles furiously remonstrate with their officers and
kill a good many of them VIELE says Tielcke especially the
foreign sort A frightful bloodbath by all the Accounts bloodbath
brandybath and chief Nucleus of Chaos then extant aboveground Fermor
is swept away this chaos the very Prussians drawing back from it
wearied with massacring lasts till about one oclock Up to the
Gallowsground the Minotaur is mere wreck and delirium but beyond the
Gallowsground the other half forms a new front to itself becomes a
new Minotaur though in reduced shape This is Part First of the Battle
of Zorndorf Friedrichon the edge of great disaster at one moment but
miraculously savedhas still the other half to do unlucky that he left
no Bridges on the Mutzel and must again change his program

Half of the Minotaur is gone to shreds in this manner but the attack
upon it too is spent what is to be done with the other half of the
monster which is again alive which still stands and polypuslike
has arranged a new life for itself a new front against the Galgengrund
yonder Friedrich brings his right wing into action Rapidly arranges
right wing centre all of the left that is disposable with batteries
with cavalry for an attack on the opposite or southeastern end of
his monster If your monster polypuslike come alive again in the
tailpart you must fell that other head of him Batteries well in
advance begin work upon the new head of the monster which was once
his tail fresh troops long lines of them pushing forward to begin
platoonvolleyingtime now I should guess about halfpast two Our
infantry has not yet got within musketrangewhen torrents of Russian
Horse Foot too following plunge out wideflowing stormfully swift
and dash against the coming attack Dash against it stagger it
actually tumble it back in the centre part take one of the batteries
and a whole battalion prisoners Here again is a moment Friedrich
they say rushed personally into this vortex rallied these broken
battalions again rallied and led them up but it was to no purpose
they could not be made to stand these centre battalionssome sudden
panic in them a thing unaccountable says Tempelhof they are Dohnas
people who fought perfectly at Jagersdorf and often elsewhere they
were all in such a finely burnished state the other day but have not
biting talent like the grassdevils enough they fairly scour away
certain disgraceful battalions and are not got ranked again till below
Wilkersdorf above a mile off though the grassdevils on both hands of
them stand grimly steady left in this ominous manner

What would have become of the affair one knows not if it had not been
that Seidlitz once more made his appearance On Friedrichs order or
on his own I do not know but sure it is Seidlitz with sixtyone
squadrons arriving from some distance breaks in like a DEUS EX
MACHINA swift as the stormwind upon this Russian Horsetorrent
drives it again before him like a mere torrent of chaff back ever
back to the shore of Acheron and the Stygian quagmires of the Mutzel
namely so that it did not return again and the Prussian infantry had
free field for their platoon exercise Their rage against the Russians
was extreme and that of the Russians corresponded Three of these
grassdevil battalions who stood nearest to Dohnas runaways were
natives of this same burntout Zorndorf Country we may fancy the
PlattTeutsch hearts of them and the sacred lightning with a
moisture to it that was in their eyes PlattTeutsch platooning
bayonetchargingon such terms no Russian or mortal Quadrilateral can
stand it The Russian Minotaur goes all to shreds a second time but
will not run No quarterWell then none

Shortly after four oclock say my Accounts the firing regular
firing altogether ceased ammunition nearly spent on both sides
Prussians snatching cartridgeboxes of Russian dead and then began a
tug of deadly massacring and wrestling man to man with bayonets
with butts of muskets with hands even with teeth in some Russian
instances such as was never seen before The Russians beaten to
fragments would not run whither run Behind is Mutzel and the bog of
Acheronon Mutzel is no bridge left the shore of Mutzel is thick
with men and horses who have tried to cross and lie there swallowed
in the oozelike a pavement says Tielcke The Russiansnever was
such VIS INERTIAE as theirs now They stood like sacks of clay like
oxen already dead not even if you shot a bullet through them would
they fall at once says Archenholtz but seem to be deliberate about it

Complete disorder reigned on both sides except that the Prussians
could always form again when bidden the Russians not This lasted till
nightfallRussians getting themselves shoved away on these horrid
terms and obstinate to take no other Towards dark there appeared on
a distant knoll something like a ranked body of them againsome 2000
foot and half as many horse whom Themicoud superlative Swiss Cossack
usually written Demikof or Demikow had picked up and persuaded from
the shore of Acheron back to this knoll of vantage and some cannon
with them Friedrich orders these to be dispersed again General
Forcade with two battalions taking the front of them shall attack
there you General Rauter bring up those Dohna fellows again and take
them in flank Forcade pushes on Rauter toobut at the first taste of
cannonshot these poor Dohnapeople such their now flurried disgraced
state of mind take to flight again worse than before rush quite
through Wilkersdorf this time into the woods and can hardly be got
together at all Scandalous to think of No wonder Friedrich looked
always askance on those regiments that had been beaten at Gross
Jagersdorf and to the end of his life gave them proofs of it
Retzowand still more emphatically _Briefe eines alten Preussischen
Officiers_ Hohenzollern 1790 i 34 ii 52 c very natural if
the rest were like these

Of poor General Rauter Tempelhof and the others that can help it are
politely silent only Saxon Tielcke tells us that Friedrich dismissed
him Go you to some other tradewhich on Prussian evidence too
expressed in veiled terms I find to be the fact _MilitairLexikon_
obliged to have an article on Rauter is very brief about it hints
nothing unkind records his personal intrepidity and says in 1758 he
on his request had leave to withdrawpoor soul leave and more

Forcade left to himself kept cannonading Themicoud Themicoud
responding would not go stood on his knoll of vantage but gathered
no strength Let him stand said Friedrich after some time and
Themicoud melted in the shades of night gradually towards the hither
shore of Acheronthat is of AcheronMutzel none now attempting
to PAVE it farther but simmering about at their sad leisure there
Feldmarschall Fermor is now got to his people again or his people to
him reunited in place and luck such a chaos as Fermor never saw before
or after No regiment or battalion now is mere simmering monads this
fine Army officers doing their utmost to cobble it into something of
rank without regard to regiments or qualities Darkness seldom sank on
such a scene

Wild Cossack parties are scouring over all parts of the field robbing
the dead murdering the wounded doing arson too wherever possible
and even snatching at the Prussian cannon left rearwards so that the
Hussars have to go upon them again One large mass of them plundering in
the Hamlet of Zicher the Hussars surrounded the Cossacks took to the
outhouses squatted ran called in the aid of fire their constant
friend above 400 of them were in some big barn or range of straw
houses and set fire to itbut could not get out for Hussars the
Hussars were at the outgate Not a devil of you said the Hussars and
the whole four hundred perished there choked burnt or slain by
the Hussarsand this poor Planet was at length rid of them
_HeldenGeschichte_ v 166

Friedrich sends for his tentequipages and the Army pitches its camp in
two big lines running north and south looking towards the Russian side
of things Friedrichs tent in front of the first line a warrior King
among his people who have had a days work of it The Russian loss

Excellency Mitchell about eight in the evening is sent for by the
King finds various chief Generals Seidlitz among them on their
various businesses there congratulates on the noble victory not so
conclusive hitherto which Heaven has granted your Majesty Had it not
been for him said FriedrichHad it not been for him things
would have had a bad look by this time and turned his suneyes upon
Seidlitz with a fine expression in them Preuss ii 153 Mitchell
ii 432 mentions the Interview nothing of Seidlitz To which
Seidlitzs reply I find was an embarrassed blush and of articulate
only Hm no ha it was your Majestys Cavalry that did their
dutybut Wakenitz my second does deserve promotionwhich
Wakenitz not in a too overflowing measure got

Fermor during the nightwatches having cobbled himself into some kind
of ranks or rows moves down well westward of Zabern Hollow to the
Drewitz Heath where he once before lay and there makes his bivouac in
the wood safe under the firtrees with the Zabern ground to front of
him By the above reckoning 28 or 29000 still hang to Fermor or
float vaporously round him with Friedrich in his two lines are some
18000in whole 46000 tired mortals sleeping thereabouts near
12000 others have fallen into a deeper sleep not liable to be
disturbedand of the wounded on the field one shudders to imagine

Next day Saturday 26th Fermor again brought into some kind of rank
and safe beyond the quaggy Zabern ground sent out a proposal That
there be Truce of Three Days for burying the deadDohna who happened
to be General in command there answers That it is customary for
the Victor to take charge of burying the slain that such proposal is
surprising and quite inadmissible in present circumstances Fermor
in the mean while had drawn himself out fronting his late battlefield
and the morning sun and began cannonading across the Zabern ground
too far off for hitting but as if still intending fight to which
the Prussians replied with cannon and drew out before their tents in
fighting order In both armies there was question or talk of
attacking anew but in both there was want of ammunition want of real
likelihood On Fermors side that of attacking could be talk only
and on Friedrichs besides the scarcity of ammunition all creatures
foot and especially horse were so worn out with yesterdays work it
was not judged practically expedient A while before noon the Prussians
retired to their Camp again leaving only the artillery to respond so
far as needful and bowwow across the Zabern ground till the Russians
lay down again

Friedrichs Hussars knew of the Russian WAGENBURG or general baggage
reservoirs at Klein Kamin by this time The Hussars had been in it
last night rummaging extensively at discretion for some time and had
brought away much money and portable plunder Why Friedrich who lay
direct between Fermor and his Wagenburg did not this day extinguish
said Wagenburg I do not know but guess it may have been a fault of
omission in the great welter this was now grown to be to the weary
mind Beyond question if one had blown up Fermors remaining gunpowder
and carried off or burnt his mealsacks he must have cowered away all
the faster towards Landsberg to seek more Or perhaps Friedrich now
judged it immaterial and a question only of hours

About midnight of SaturdaySunday there again rose bowwowing
bellowing of Russian cannon not from beyond the Zabern ground this
time nor stationary anywhere but from the south some transient part of
it and not far offone ball struck a carriage near the Kings tent
and shattered it Thick mist mantles everything and it is difficult to
know what the Russians have on hand in their sylvan seclusions After
a time it becomes manifest the Russians are on retreat winding round
through the southern woods behind Zorndorf and the charred Villages
to Klein Kamin Landsberg way Friedrich following now on the heel
of them finds all got to Klein Kamin to breakfast there in
their Wagenburg refectorysharply vigilant many FLECHES little
arrowshaped redoubts so named and much artillery round them Nothing
considerable to be done upon them now or afterwards except pick up
stragglers and distress their rear a little The King himself in the
first movement was thought to be in alarming peril such a blaze of
caseshot rose upon him as he went reconnoitring foremost of all

And this was at last the end of Zorndorf Battle on the third day
this Was there ever seen such a fight of Theseus and the Minotaur
Theseus rapid dexterous with Heavens lightning in his eyes seizing
the Minotaur lassoing him by the hinder foot then by the right horn
pouring steel and destruction into him the very dust darkening all the
air Minotaur refusing to die when killed tumbling to and fro upon its
Theseus the two lugging and tugging flinging one another about and
describing figures of 8 round each other for three days before it ended
Minotaur walking off on his own feet after all It was the bloodiest
battle of the SevenYears War one of the most furious ever fought such
rage possessing the individual elements rage unusual in modern wars
Must have altered Friedrichs notion of the Russians when he next comes
to speak with Keith It was not till the fourth day hence August
31st so unattackably strong was this position at Klein Kamin that the
Russian Minotaur would fairly get to its feet a second time and
slowly stagger off in real earnest Landsberg way and Konigsberg
wayFriedrich right glad to leave Dohna in attendance on it and
hasten off September 2d towards Saxony and Prince Henri where his
presence is now become very needful

Colberg is the paltriest crowsnest BICOQUE according to all
engineers and is defended only by 700 militia the Colonel of them one

here came to be Palmbach with his best diligence could make nothing

ways blurting and blazing at a mighty rate for four weeks and wasting
a great deal of gunpowder and 2000 Russian lives withdrew on those

which is interesting to read of as all the Three of them are And
did then as tail of Fermor what Fermor and the Russian Monster was
universally doing make off at a good pacehaving nothing to live upon
fartherand vanish from those Countries to the relief of Dohna and
mankind

September 2d Friedrich leaving all that had marched for Saxony
his presence urgently required there Daun ought to be far on with the
conquest of that Country Might have had it say judges if he had been
as swift as someAt Zorndorf among the Russian Prisoners were certain
Generals Soltikof Czernichef Sulkowski the Pole proud people in
their own eyes no lodging for them but the cellars of Custrin Russian
Generals complained Is this a lodging for FieldOfficers of rank
Friedrich was not used to profane swearing or vituperative outbursts
but he answered to the effect Silence ye incendiary individuals Is
there a choice left of lodgings and for you above others Upon
which they lay silent for some days till better suited in fact till
exchangedand perhaps will soon turn up on us again




Chapter XIVBATTLE OF HOCHKIRCH

So soon as Friedrich quitted Bohemia and Silesia for his Russian
Enterprise there rose high question at Vienna To what shall our Daun
now turn himself A Daun a Reichs Army free for new employment in
Saxony not much to oppose them in Silesia almost nothing in comparison
Recapture of Silesia Yes truly that is the steady polestar at
Vienna But they have no Magazines in Silesia no Siegefurnitures and
the season is far spent They decide that there shall be a stroke upon
Dresden and recovery of Saxony in Friedrichs absence Nothing there
at present but a Prince Henri weak in numbers say one to two of the
Reichs Army by itself Let the Reichs Army rise now and advance through
the Metal Mountains from southeast on Prince Henri let Daun circle
round on him through the Lausitz from northeast cannot they extinguish
Henri between them snatch Dresden a weak illfortified place by
sudden onslaught and recapture Saxony That will be magnanimous to our
august Alliesand that will be an excellent scaffolding for recapture
of Silesia next year And cannot Daun leave a Force in the Silesian
vicinitiesDeville with so many thousands Harsch with so
manyto besiege one of their Frontier Places Neisse for example
Siegefurnitures to come from Mahren Neisse is not farther from Olmutz
than Olmutz was from it

That was the scheme fallen upon now getting executed while Friedrich
is at Zorndorf well away And that if readers fix it intelligently in
their memory will suffice to introduce to them the few words more that
can be allowed us here upon it A very few words compressed to the
utmostmerely as preface to Hochkirch whither we must hasten
Hochkirch being the one incident which except to studious soldiers has
now and here any interest out of the very many incidents which then
and there were so intensely interesting to all mankind To readers who
are curious and will take with them any poorest authentic Outline
of the Localities concerned the following condensed Note will not be
unintelligible




DAUN AND THE REICHS ARMY INVADE SAXONY IN FRIEDRICHS ABSENCE

Daun pushing out with his best speed along the BohemianSilesian
border had got to Zittau AUGUST 17th which poor City is to be his
basis and storehouse the greatest activity and wagoning now visible
thereamong the burnt walls getting rebuilt And in the same days
Zweibruck and his Reichs Army are vigorously afoot Zweibruck pushing
across the Metal Mountains the fastest he can intending to plant
himself in Pirna Country Not to mention General Dombale Zweibrucks
Austrian Second who has the Austrian 15000 with him and by way
of preface has emerged to westward in ZwickauTschopau Country
calculating that Prince Henri will not be able to attend to him just
now And in effect Prince Henri intent upon Zweibruck and the Pirna
Country takes position in the old Prussian ground there headquarter
Gross Seidlitz as in 1756 and can only leave a Detachment in
Tschopau Country to wait upon Dombale who does at least shoot out Croat
parties quite across Saxony to Halle all the way and entertain the
Gazetteers if he can do little real mischief

AUGUST 19th from Zittau Daun after short pause again pushes
forwardnothing but Ziethen attending him in the distance till we see
whitherwardMargraf Karl waiting impatient at Grussau till Ziethen
see Tempelhof ii 258 260 et seq Daun soon after Zittau shoots
out Loudon Brandenburg way as if magnanimously intending cooperation
with the Russians which would give Daun pleasure could it be done
without cost Loudon does despatch a 500 hussars to Frankfurt Friedrich
now gone for Custrin who I think carry a Letter for Fermor there
but lose it by the wayfor the benefit of readers if they will wait
Loudon captures a poor little place in Brandenburg itself bullies it
into surrender after a day the very day of Zorndorf Battle August
25thplace called Peitz garrisoned by fortyfive invalids who go
on free withdrawal poor old souls and leave their exiguous stock of
saltvictual and military furnitures to Loudon In _HeldenGeschichte_
v 229232 the Capitulation IN EXTENSO Upon which Loudon
whirls back out of those Countries finding his skirts trodden on by
Ziethenwho now sees what Daun and he are at and warns Margraf Karl
properly Keith who has now joined again as real president or chief
That HITHER is the way Margraf Karl on the slip for some time past
starts from Grussau instantly I should guess not above 25000 of
all arms leaving Fouquet with perhaps 10000 to do his utmost when
Generals Harsch and Deville with their 20 or 30000 come upon Silesia
and himas indeed they are already doing already blockading Neisse
more or less with an eye to besieging it so soon as possible

Meanwhile Serene Highness of Zweibruck the Reichsfolk and some
Austrians with him prefaced by Dombale more to westward is wending
into Pirna Country and in spite of what Prince Henri can do Mayor
and the Free Corps shining diligent and Henri one of the watchfulest of
men Zweibruck does get in sets Maguire with Austrians upon besieging
Pirna that is to say the Sonnenstein of Pirna 3d5th SEPTEMBER
gets the Sonnenstein a thought sooner than was counted on In
_HeldenGeschichte_ v 223228 account of this poor Siege and of the
movements before and after and roots himself thereheadquarters in
Struppen again bridge at OberRaden again all as in 1756 which if
nothing else can well do it may give his Highness a momentary interest
with some readers here Prince Henri is at Gross Seidlitz alive every
fibre of him but with Daun circling round to northward on his left
intending evidently to take him in flank or rear with Dombale already
to rear in the above circumstances on his right and Zweibruck himself
lying here in front free to act and impregnable if acted upon what
is Prince Henri to do It is for Henris rear not his flank that Daun
aims AUGUST 26th Daun who had got to Gorlitz a march or two from
Zittau started again at his best step by the Bautzen Highway towards
Meissen Bridge a 70 or 80 miles down the Elbe there Daun intends to
cross and to double back upon Dresden and Prince Henri who will thus
find himself enclosed between THREE firesif two were not enough or
even if one the Daun one itself or the Zweibruck itself not to count
the Dombale in such strength as Prince Henri has

A lost Prince Henriif there be not shift in him if there be not
help coming to him Prince Henri seeing how it was drew back from
Gross Seidlitz with beautiful suddenness one night unmolested in
the morning Zweibruchs hussars find him posted inexpugnable on the
Heights of Gahmigwhich is nearer Dresden a good step nearer Dombale
and not so ready to be enclosed by Daun without enclosure of Dresden
too Prince Henris manoeuvring in this difficult situation is the
admiration of military men how he stuck by Gahmig but threw out
in the vital points little campscamp of Kesselsdorf a place
memorable on the west of Dresden and on the east in the north suburb
of Dresden itself across the River should we have to go across the
River for Dauns sake a strong abatis and neglected nothing self
and everybody under him lively as eagles to make themselves dangerous
Mayer in particular distinguishing himself much Prince Henri would
have been a hard morsel for Daun But beyond that there is help on the
road




FRIEDRICH INTERVENING DAUN DRAWS BACK INTRENCHES HIMSELF IN
NEIGHBORHOOD TO DRESDEN AND PIRNA FRIEDRICH FOLLOWING HIM FOUR ARMIES
STANDING THERE IN DEADLOCK FOR A MONTH WITH ISSUE A FLANKMARCH
ON THE PART OF FRIEDRICHS ARMY WHICH HALTS AT HOCHKIRCH September
12thOctober 10th 1758

Daun since August 26th is striding towards Meissen Bridge without
rest day after day at the very top of his speedwhich I find is
nine miles a day Tempelhof ii 261 Bos being heavy of foot
at his best September 1st Daun has got within ten miles of Meissen
Bridge whenHere is news my friends King of Prussia has beaten our
poor Russians will soon be in full march this way King of Prussia and
Margraf Karl both bending hitherward at the rate say of nineteen
miles a day instead of nineMeissen Bridge is not the thing we shall
want Daun instantly calls halt at this news waits intrenches and
in a day or two finding the news true hurries to rearward all he can
From the Russian side too Daun has heard of Zorndorf and the grand
Victory of Fermor there but knows well by this sudden reemergence
of the AntiFermor what kind of Victory it is

Was it here while waiting about Meissen or where was it that Daun got
his Letter to Fermor answered in that singular way The Letter of two
weeks agocarried by Loudons Hussars or by whomsoeverfor certain
it was retorted or returned upon Daun not as if from the DeadLetter
Office but with an Answer he little expected Here is what record I
have very vague for a wellknown little fact of sparkling nature

A curious Letter fell into Friedrichs hands Bearer I always guess
the Loudon HussarCaptain with his 500 pretending to form junction
with Fermor Prussian Hussars picking it up somewheredate place
circumstances blurred into oblivion in those poor Books Letter itself
indisputable enough and Answer following on it Letter and Answer
substantially to this effect

DAUN TO FERMOR Probably from Zittau by Loudons Hussars

Your Excellenz does not know that wily Enemy as I do By no means get
into battle with such a one Cautiously manoeuvre about detain him
there till I have got my stroke in Saxony done dont try fighting him

DAUN

ANSWER AS FROM FERMOR Zorndorf once done Daun by the first
opportunity got his Answer duly signed Fermor but evidently in a
certain Kings handwriting

Your Excellenz was in the right to warn me against a cunning Enemy
whom you knew better than I Here have I tried fighting him and got
beaten Your unfortunate FERMOR Muller _Kurzgefasste Beschreibung
der drei Schlesischen Kriege_ Berlin 1755 in whom alone of all the
reporters is the story given in an intelligible form This Mullers
Book is a meritoriously brief Summary incorrect in no essential
particular and with all the BattlePlans on one copperplate LIEUTENANT
Muller this one not PROFESSOR Muller ALIAS Schottmuller by any
means

September 9th Friedrich and Margraf Karl correct to their appointment
meet at Grossenhayn some miles north of Meissen and its Bridge by
which time Daun is clean gone again back well above Dresden again
strongly posted at Stolpen a place we once heard of in General
Haddicks time last Year well in contact with Dauns Pirna friends
across the River and out of dangerous neighborhoods Friedrich and the
Margraf have followed Daun at quick step but Daun would pause nowhere
till he got to Stolpen among the bushy gullets and chasms September
12th Friedrich had speech of Henri and the pleasure of dining with
him in Dresden Glad to meet again under fortunate management on both
parts and with much to speak and consult about

A day or two before there had lain or is said to have lain a grand
scheme in Daun Zweibruck to burst out from Pirna by daybreak and
attack the Camp of Gahmig in front 35000 against 20000 Daun to
cross the River on pontoons some hours before under cloud of night
and be ready on rear and left flank of Gahmig with as many supplemental
thousands as you like what can save Prince Henri Beautiful plan on
which there were personal meetings and dinings together by Zweibruck and
Daun but nothing done Tempelhof ii 262265 At the eleventh hour
say the Austrian accounts Zweibruck sent word Impossible tomorrow
cannot get in my OutParties in timeand next day here is Friedrich
come and a collapse of everything Or perhaps there never seriously was
such a plan Certain it is Daun takes camp at Stolpen a place known
to him one of the strongest posts in Germany intrenches himself to
the teethgood rearguard towards Zittau and the Magazines River
and Pirna on our left flank Loudon strong and busy on our right flank
barring the road to Bautzenand obstinately sits there a very bad
tooth in the jaw of a certain King not to be extracted by the best
kinds of forceps and the skilfulest art for nearly a month to come
Four Armies Friedrichs Henris Dauns Zweibrucks all within
swordstroke of each otherthe universal Gazetteer world is on tiptoe
But except Friedrichs eager shiftings and rubbings upon Stolpen west
side north and at length northeast side all is deadlock and
nothing comes of it

Friedrich has his food convenient from Dresden but a road to Bautzen
withal is what he cannot do withoutand there lies the sorrow and the
ACHING as this tooth knows well and this jaw well Harsch and Deville
are busy upon Neisse have Neisse under blockade perhaps upon Kosel
too for some time past Neisse blockaded more and more since August
4th Kosel still earlier but only by Pandour people not completely so
till September 30th or even till October 26th _HeldenGeschichte_ v
268270 and are carting the siegestock to begin bombardment a road
to Silesia before very long Friedrich must and will have Friedrichs
operations on Daun in this post are patiently artful and curious to
look upon but beyond description here enough to say that in the
second week he makes his people hut themselves weather wet and bad
and in the fourth week finding that nothing contrivable would provoke
Daun into fightinghe loads at Dresden provisions for I think nine
days makes from two or from three sides a sudden spurt upon Loudon
who is Dauns northern outpost brushes Loudon hastily away and himself
takes the road for Bautzen by Dauns right flank thrown bare in this
manner Tempelhof ii 278

Road for Bautzen which is the road for Zittau withal for Dauns
breadbasket as well as for Neisse and Harsch Nine days provision
that is our small outfit that and our own righthands and the waste
world lies all ahead OCTOBER 1st Retzow as vanguard sweeps out
the few Croats from Bautzen deposits his mealwagons there occupies
Hochkirch and the hilly environs to east is to take possession of
Weissenberg especially and of the Stromberg Hill and other strong
points which Retzow punctually does forgetting nothingexcept
perhaps the Stromberg not quite remembered in time a thing of small
consequence in Retzows view since all else had gone right

Hearing of which Daun with astonishment finds that he must quit those
beautifully chasmy fastnesses of Stolpen and look to his bread which
is getting to lie under the enemys feet if Zittau road be left yonder
as it is OCTOBER 5th after councils of war and deliberation enough
Daun gets under way Ib ii 279 cautiously favored by a night very
dark and wet glides through to right of Friedrichs people softly
along between Bautzen and the Pirna Country nobody molesting him so
dark and wet and after one other march in those bosky solitudes sits
down at Kittlitzahead or to east of Bautzen of Hochkirch of
Retzow and all Friedrichs peopleand again sets to palisading
and intrenching there Kittlitz near Lobau there is Dauns new
headquarter Lobau Water with its intricate hollows his line of
defence his posts going out a mile to north and to south of Kittlitz
And so sits once more blocking Zittau road and quietly waiting what
Friedrich will do

Friedrich is at Bautzen since the 7th impatient enough to be forward
but must not till a second larger provisionconvoy from Dresden come in
Convoy once in Friedrich hastens off Tuesday 10th October towards
Weissenberg Country where Retzow is some ten or twelve miles to
eastwardZittauward if that chance to suit us Silesiaward as
is sure to suit At the Pass of Jenkowitz short way from Bautzen
Pandours attempt our baggage need to be battered off and again
off which apprises Friedrich that Dauns whole Army is ahead in the
neighborhood somewhere Marching on Friedrich from the knoll of
Hochkirch shoulder of the southern Hills gets complete view of
Daunstretching north and south at right angles to the Zittau roads
and to Friedrich in the way we describedand is a little surprised
and I could guess piqued at seeing Daun in such a state of forwardness
Encamp here then he sayshere on this row of Heights parallel to
Daun within a mile of Daun just here I tell you under the very
nose of Daun who is above two to one of us and see what Daun will
do Marwitz his favorite Adjutant one of those freespoken Marwitzes
loyal skilful but liable to stiff fits takes the liberty to
remonstrate argue says at length He Marwitz dare not be concerned
in marking out such an encampment not he for his poor part And is put
under arrest and another Adjutant does it cannon playing on his people
and him while engaged in the operation

Friedrichs obstinate rashness this Tuesday Evening has not wanted its
abundant meed of blamerendered so emphatic by what befell on Saturday
morning next His somewhat too authoritative fixity a certain radiancy
of selfconfidence dangerous to a man his sovereign contempt of
Daun as an inert dark mass who durst undertake nothing all this
is undeniable and worth our recognition in estimating Friedrich One
considerably extenuating circumstance does at last turn upin the
shape of a new piece of blame to the erring Friedrich his sudden anger
namely against the meritorious General Retzow his putting Retzow under
arrest that Tuesday Evening How General Retzow You have not taken
hold of the Stromberg for me That is the secret of Retzow and on
studying the ground you will find that the Stromberg a blunt tabular
Hill of good height detached and towering well up over all that
region might have rendered Friedrichs position perfectly safe Seize
me the Stromberg tomorrow morning the first thing ordered Friedrich
And a Detachment went accordingly but found Dauns people already
thereindisposed to go nay determined not to go and getting
reinforced to unlimited amounts So that the Stromberg was left
standing and remained Dauns furnished with plenty of cannon by Daun
Retzows arrest Retzow being a steady favorite of Friedrichs was only
of a few hours pardonable that oversight thinks Friedrich though it
came to cost him dear For the rest I find Friedrichs keeping of this
Camp without the Stromberg was intended to end the third day hence
Saturday 14th then since Friday proves impossible Friedrich had
settled And it did end Saturday 14th though at an earlier HOUR and
with other results than had been expected Keith said The Austrians
deserve to be hanged if they dont attack us here We must hope they
are more afraid of us than even of the gallows answered Friedrich
A very dangerous Camp untenable without the Stromberg Let us try to
understand it and Dauns position to it in some slight degree

Hochkirch HIGHkirk is an old WendishSaxon Village standing
pleasantly on its Hilltop conspicuous for miles round on all sides
or on all but the south side where it abuts upon other Heights which
gradually rise into Hills a good deal higher than it The Village hangs
confusedly a jumble of cottages and colegarths on the crown and north
slope of the Height thatched in part tiled and built mostly of rough
stone blocks in our timenot of wood as probably in Friedrichs A
solid sluttishly comfortablelooking Village with pleasant hayfields
or long narrow haystripes each villager has his stripe reaching down
to the northern levels The Church is near the top Churchyard and some
little space farther are nearly horizontal ground till the next Height
begins sloping up again towards the woody Hills southward The view from
this little esplanade atop still better from the Church belfry is wide
and pretty Free on all sides except the south pleasant Heights and
Hollows of arable of wood or pasture well watered by rushing Brooks
all making northward direct for Spree the Berlin Spree or else into
the Lobau Water which is the first big branch of Spree

The place is still partly of Wendish speech the Parson has to preach
one half of the Sunday in Wend the other in German Among the Hills
to south well worth noting at present is one called CZARNABOG or
Devils Hill where the Wendish Devil and his Witches equal to any
German on his Blocksberg or preternatural Bracken of the Harz hold
their annual WITCHESSABBATHa thing not to be contemplated without
a shudder by the Wendish mind Thereabouts and close from Hochkirch
southward all is shadowy intricacy of thicket and wild wood Northward
too from Hochkirch and all about I perceive the scene was woodier then
than nowand must have looked picturesque enough had anybody been
in quest of that with the multifarious uniforms and tented people
sprinkled far and wide among the leafy redandyellow of October 1758
Tourists Note September 1858

In the Village of Wuischke precisely at the northern base of that
shaggy Czarnabog or Devils Hill stand Loudon and 3000 Croats and
grenadiers as the extreme left of Dauns position Wuischke is nearly
straight south of Hochkirch so far westward has Loudon pushed forward
with his Croats hidden among the Hills though Dauns general position
lies a good mile to east of Friedrichsirregularly north and south
both Friedrich and Daun the former ignorant what Croats and Loudonries
there may be among those Devils Hills to his right the latter not
ignorant Friedrichs right wing Keith in command of it stretches
to Hochkirch and a little farther beyond Hochkirch it has Four flank
Battalions in potence form with proper vedettes and pickets and above
all with a strong Battery of Twenty Guns which it maintains on the
next Height immediately adjoining Hochkirch and perceptibly higher than
Hochkirch This is the finis of Keith on his right andexcept those
vedettes and pickets of Freecorps people thrown out a little way
ahead into the bushes on that sideFriedrichs right wing knows
nothing of the shaggy elevations horrent with wood which lie to
southward and merely intends to play its Twenty Cannon upon them
should they give birth to anything This is Friedrichs posture on his
right or south wing

From Hochkirch northward or nearly so but sprinkled about in all the
villages and points of strength as far up as Drehsa and beyond Drehsa
to near Kotitz a less important village Friedrich extends about four
miles centre at Rodewitz where his own headquarter is above two
miles north of Hochkirch Not far from Rodewitz but a little to left
and ahead stands his second and best Battery of Thirty Guns ready to
play upon Lauska a poor village and its roadway should the Austrians
try anything there or from their Stromberg post which is a good mile
behind Lauska His strength in these lines some count to be only
28000 or less Four or five miles to northeast in and behind
Weissenberg which we used to know last summer lies Retzow with
perhaps 10 or 12000 which will bring him up to 40000 were they
properly joined with him as a left wing Dauns force counts 90000
with Friedrich lying under his nose in this insolent manner

Dauns headquarter as we said is Kittlitz a Village some two miles
short of Lobau in the direction southeast of Friedrich perhaps five
miles to southeast of Rodewitz Friedrichs lodging It is close upon
the BautzenZittau Highway Zittau some twenty miles to south of it
Herrnhuth and the pacific Brethren about halfway thither Kittlitz lies
more to south than Hochkirch itself and Dauns outposts as we saw
circle quite round among those Devils Hills and envelop Friedrichs
right flank But Dauns main force lies chiefly northward and well
to west of Kittlitz parallel to Friedrich and eastward of him with
elaborate intrenchments every village brook bridge height and bit of
good ground Stromberg to end with punctually secured Obliquely over
the Stromberg holding the Stromberg and certain Villages to southeast
and to northwest of it lies DAhremberg as right wing about 20000
he put into oblique potence looking into Kotitz which is Friedrichs
extreme left and in a good measure dividing Friedrich from the Retzow
10000 And lastly as reserve in front of Reichenbach eight or nine
miles to east of all that lies the Prince of BadenDurlach 25000 or
so barring Retzow on that side and all attempts on the Silesian
Road there Dauns lines not counting in the southern outposts or
DevilsHill parties are considerably longer than Friedrichs and also
considerably deeper The two headquarters are about five miles apart
but the two frontsdivided by a brook and good hollow running here one
of many such making all for Lobau Waterare not half a mile apart
Towards Hochkirch and the top of this brook the opposing posts are
quite crammed close on one another divided only by their hollow Many
brooks each with a definite hollow run tinkling about here swift but
straitened to get out especially Lobau Water which receives them all
has to take a quite meandering circling course through Dauns quarters
and beyond them before it can disembogue in Spree and decidedly set
out for Berlin under that new name The Landscapeseen from Hochkirch
Village still better from the Churchsteeple which lifts you high

WHAT ACTUALLY BEFELL AT HOCHKIRCH Saturday 14th October 1758

Friedrich for some timeprobably ever since Wednesday morning when
he found the Stromberg was not to be hishad decided to be out of this
bad post In which clearly enough nothing was to be done unless
Daun would attempt something else than more and more intrenching and
palisading himself Friedrich on the second day Thursday 12th rode
across to Weissenberg to give Retzow his directions and take view of
the ground Saturday night Herr Retzow sooner it cannot be Friedrich
had aimed at Friday night but finds the Provisionconvoy cannot
possibly be up Saturday night in all silence we sweep round out of
thiswe and youhurl BadenDurlach about his business and are at
Schops and Reichenbach and the Silesian Highway open next morning
to us Tempelhof ii 320 Quietly everything is speeding on towards
this consummation on Friedrichs part But on Dauns part there
isstarted I should guess on the very same Thursdayanother
consummation getting ready which is to fall out on Saturday MORNING
fifteen hours before that other and entirely supersede that other

Keiths opinion that the Austrians deserve to be hanged if they
dont attack us here is also Loudons opinion and Lacys and indeed
everybodysand at length Dauns own who determines to try something
here if never before or after This plan all judges admit was
elaborate and good and was well executed tooDaun himself presiding
over the most critical part of the execution A plan to have ruined
almost any Army except this Prussian one and the Captain it chanced
to have A universal camisado or surprisal of Friedrich in his Camp
before daylight everybody knows that it took effect Hochkirch
Saturday 14th October 1758 5 AM of a misty morning nobody expects
of an unassisted fellowcreature much light on so doubly dark a thing
But the truth is there are ample accounts exact though very chaotic
and the thing steadily examined till its essential features
extricate themselves from the unessential proves to be not quite
so unintelligible and nothing like so destructive overwhelming and
ruinous as was supposed

Dauns plan is very elaborate and includes a great many combinations
all his 90000 to come into it simultaneously or in succession But the
first and grandly vital part mainspring and father to all the rest is
this That Daun in person after nightfall of Friday shall with the
pick of his force say 30000 horse and foot with all their artilleries
and tools silently quit his now position in front of Hochkirch
Friedrichs right wing Shall sweep off silently to southward and
leftward by Wuischke thence westward and northward by the northern
base of those Devil Mountains through the shaggy hollows and thick
woods there hitherto inhabited by Croats only and unknown to the
Prussians forward ever forward through the nightwatches that way
till he has fairly got to the flank of Hochkirch and Friedrich Daun to
be standing there all round from the southern environs of Hochkirch
westward through the Woods by Meschwitz Steindorfel and even north
to Waditz if readers will consult their Map silently enclosing
Friedrich as in the bag of a net in this mannerready every man and
gun by about four on Saturday morning Are to wait for the stroke of
five in Hochkirch steeple and there and then to begin businessthere
first but on success THERE the whole 90000 everywhereand to draw
the strings on Friedrich and bag and strangle his astonished people and
him

The difficulty has been to keep it perfectly secret from so vigilant a
man as Friedrich but Daun has completely succeeded Perhaps Friedrichs
eyes have been a little dimmed by contempt of Daun Daun for the
last two days especially has been more diligent than ever to palisade
himself on every point nothing seemingly on hand but felling woods
building abatis against some dangerous Lionsspring They say also
he detected a traitor in his camp traitor carrying Letters to Friedrich
under pretence of fresh eggsone of the eggs blown and a Note of
Dauns Procedures substituted as yolk You are dead sirrah said
Daun hoisted to the highest gallows Are not you But put in a Note
of my dictating and your beggarly life is saved Retzow Junior though
there is no evidence except of the circumstantial kind thinks this
current story may be true Retzow i 347 Certain it is neither
Friedrich nor any of his people had the least suspicion of Dauns
project till the moment it exploded on them when the clock at
Hochkirch struck five Daun in the last two days had been felling even
more trees than they are aware ofthousands of trees in those Devils
wildernesses to Friedrichs right and has secretly hewn himself roads
passable by night for men and ammunitionwagons thereand in front of
Friedrich especially Hochkirch way Daun seems busier than ever felling
wood this Friday night numbers of people running about with axes with
lanterns over there as if in the push of hurry and making a great deal
of noise Intending retreat for Zittau tomorrow thinks Friedrich as
the false eggyolk had taught him or merely That poor precautionary
fellow supposing the false yolk a myth In short Daun has got through
his nocturnal wildernesses with perfect success And stands dreamt of
by no enemy in the places appointed for his 30000 and him and that
poor old clock of Hochkirch unweariedly grunting forward to the stroke
of five will strike up something it is little expecting

The Prussians have vedettes pickets and small outposts of Freecorps
people scattered about within their border of that Austrian Wood the
body of which about Hochkirch as everywhere else belongs wholly to
Croats Of course there are guardparties sentries duly vigilant in
the big Battery to southeast of Hochkirchand along southwestward in
that POTENCE or forearm of Four Battalions which are stationed there
Four good Battalions looking southward there with Cavalry to right
Ziethens Cavalrywhose horses stand saddled through the night ready
always for the nocturnal Pandourade which seldom fails them There
as elsewhere are the due vigilances watchmen watchfires The rest of
the Prussian Army is in its blankets wholly asleep while Daun stands
waiting for the stroke of five

That Daun bursting in with his chosen 30000 will trample down the
sleeping Prussian POTENCE at Hochkirch capture its big Battery to left
its Village of Hochkirch to rear and do extensive ruin on the whole
right wing of Friedrich rendering Friedrich everywhere an easy conquest
to the rest of Dauns people who stand far and wide duly posted and
prepared waiting only their signal from Hochkirch much of this all of
it that had regard to Hochkirch Battery and Village and the Prussians
stationed there Daun did execute And readers from the data they have
got must conceive the manner of ithuman description of the next Two
Hours about Hochkirch in the thick darkness there and stormful sudden
inroad and stormful resistance made being manifestly an impossible
thing Nobody was massacred in his bed as the sympathetic gazetteers
fancied nobody was killed that I hear of without arms in his hand
but plenty of people perished fierce of humor on both sides and from
halfpast five till towards eight there was a general blaze of fiery
chaos pushing out ever and anon swallowed in the belly of Night again
such as was seldom seen in this world Instead of confused details and
wearisome enumeration of particulars which nobody would listen to or
understand we will give one intelligent young gentlemans experience
our friend Tempelhofs who stood in this part of the Prussian Line
experience distinct and indubitable to us and which was pretty
accurately symbolical I otherwise see of what befell on all points
thereabouts Faithfully copied and in the essential parts not even
abridged here it is

Tempelhof at that time a subaltern of artillery was stationed with a
couple of 24pounders in attendance on the Battalion Plothow which
with three others and some cavalry lay to the south side of Hochkirch
forming a kind of forearm or POTENCE there to right of the big Battery
with their rear to Hochkirch and keeping vedettes and Freecorps
parties spread out into the woods and Devils Hills ahead Tempelhof
had risen about three as usual had his guns and gunners ready and was
standing by the watchfire expecting the customary Pandourade and
what form it would take this morning Close on five oclock and not a
mouse stirring We are not to have our Pandourade then On a sudden
noise bursts out noise enough sharp fire among the Freecorps people
fire growing ever sharper noisier for the next halfhour but nothing
whatever to be seen Battalion Plothow had soon got its clothes on all
to the spatterdashes and took rank to right and left of the FLECHE and
of my two guns in front of its post but on account of the thick
fog everything was totally dark I fired off my cannons shall we say
straight southward to learn whether there was anything in front of
us No answer Nothing therePshaw a mere crackery GEKNACKER of
Pandours and our Freecorps people after all But the noise grew
louder and came ever nearer I turned my guns towards it southward
southeastward or perhaps a gun each wayand here we had a salvo in
response from some battalions who seemed to be two hundred yards or so
ahead The Battalion Plothow hereupon gave fire I too plied my cannons
what I couldand had perhaps delivered fifteen double shots from them
when at once I tumbled to the ground and lost all consciousness for
some minutes or moments

Awakening with the blood running down his face poor Tempelhof concluded
it had been a musketshot in the head but on getting to his hands and
knees he found the place full of Austrian grenadiers who had crept in
through our tents to rear and that it had been a knock with the butt of
the musket from one of those fellows and not a bullet that had struck
him down Battalion Plothow assailed on all sides resisted on all
sides and Tempelhof saw from the groundI suppose by the embers
of watchfires and by rare flashes of musketry for they did not fire
much having no room but smashed and stabbed and cutan infantry
fight which in murderous intensity surpasses imagination I was taken
prisoner at this turn but soon after got delivered by our cavalry
again Tempelhof ii 324 n

This latter circumstance of being delivered by the Cavalry I find to
be of frequent occurrence in that first act of the business there the
Prussian Battalion surprised on front and rear always makes murderous
fight for itself is at last overwhelmed obliged to retire perhaps
opening its way by bayonet chargeupon which our Cavalry Ziethens
and others that gathered to him cutting in upon the disordered
surprisers cut them into flight rescue the prisoners and for a time
reinstate matters The Prussian battalions do not run nobody runs but
when repulsed by the endless odds rally again The big Battery is not
to be had of them without fierce and dogged struggle and is retaken
more than once or twice Still fiercer more dogged was the struggle
in Hochkirch Village especially in Hochkirch Church and
Churchyardwhither the Battalion MargrafKarl had flung themselves
the poor Village soon taking fire about them Soon taking fire and
continuing to be a scene of capture and recapture by the flamelight
while Battalion MargrafKarl stood with invincible stubbornness pouring
death from it not to be compulsed by the raging tide of Austrian
grenadiers not by six Austrian battalions by eight or by never
so many Stood at bay there levelling whole masses of themtill its
cartridges were spent all to one or two per man and Major Lange the
heroic Captain of it said We shall have to go then my men let us
cut ourselves throughand did so in an honorably invincible manner
some brave remnant actually getting through with Lange himself wounded
to death

I think it was not till towards six oclock that the right wing
generally became aware what the case was More than a Pandourade
yesthough what it might be in the thick fog which had fallen
blotting out all vestiges of daylight nobody could well say Rallied
Battalions reinforced by this or the other Battalion hurrying up from
leftward always charge in upon the enemy in Hochkirch or wherever he
is busy generally push him back into the Night but are then fallen
upon on both flanks by endless new strength and obliged to draw back in
turn And Ziethens Horse in the mean while do execution breaking in
on the tumultuous victors new Cuirassiers GensdArmes dashing up
to help so soon as saddled and charging with a will so that on the
whole the enemy variously attempting could make nothing of us on that
western or rearward sidethanks mainly to Ziethen and the Horse Had
we but waited till three or four of our Battalions had got up say the
Prussian narrators But it is thick mist few yards ahead you cannot see
at all unless it be flame and close at hand all things and figures
waver indistincthairy outlines of blacker shadows on a ground of
black

It must have been while Lange was still fighting perhaps before Lange
took to the Church of Hochkirch scarcely later than halfpast six but
nobody thought of pulling out his watch in such a businessabout six
or halfpast six when Keith who has charge of this wing and lodges
somewhere below or north of Hochkirch came to understand that his
big Battery was taken that here was such a Pandourade as had not been
before and that of a surety said Battery must be retaken Keith
springs on horseback hastily takes Battalion Kannacker and several
remnants of others rushes upwards leaving Hochkirch a little to
right direct upon the big Battery Recaptures the big Battery But
is set upon by overwhelming multitudes bent to have it backis
passionate for new assistance in this vital point but can get none
had been DISARTED by both his Aidedecamps says poor John Tebay
a wandering English horsesoldier who attends him as mounted groom
asked twenty times and twenty more Where are my Aidedecamps
Captens Cockcey and Goudy he calls themCOCCEJI whose Father
the Kanzler we have seen and GAUDI whose selfwho both had in
succession struck into Hochkirch as the less desperate place according
to Tebay see TEBAYS LETTER to Mitchell Crossen October 29th in
MEMOIRS AND PAPERS ii 501505which is probably true every word
allowing for Tebays temper but is highly indecipherable though not
entirely so after many readings and researehingsbut could get
no response or reinforcement and at length quite surrounded and
overwhelmed had to retire opening his way by the bayonet and before
long suddenly stopping shortfalling dead into Tebays arms shot
through the heart Two shots on the right side he had not regarded
but this on the left side was final Keiths fightings are suddenly
all done Tebay in distraction tried much to bring away the body but
could by no present means distractedly rid for a coach found on
return that the Austrians had the ground and the body of his master
Hochkirch Church and all now undisputedly theirs

To appearance it was this news of Keiths repulse I know not whether
of Keiths DEATH as yet that first roused Friedrich to a full sense of
what was now going on two miles to south of him Friedrich according
to his habits must have been awake and afoot when the Business first
broke out though for some considerable time treating it as nothing
but a common crackery of Pandours Already finding the Pandourade
louder than usual he had ordered out to it one battalion and the other
that lay handy but now he pushes forward several battalions under Franz
of Brunswick his youngest Brotherinlaw with Margraf Karl and
Prince Moritz Swift you to Hochkirch yonderand himself springs on
horseback to deal with the affair Prince Franz of Brunswick poor young
fellow cheerily coming on near Hochkirch had his head shorn off by a
cannonball Moritz of Dessau too riding within twenty yards of the
Austrians so dark was it he so nearsighted got badly hitand soon
after driving to Bautzen for surgery was made prisoner by Pandours
In ARCHENHOLTZ i 289 290 his dangerous adventures on the road to
Bautzen in this wounded condition never fought again died next
year of cancer in the lip Nothing but triumphant Austrian shot and
cannonshot going yonder these battalions too have to fall back with
sore loss

Friedrich himself by this time is forward in the thick of the tumult
with another body of battalions storming furiously along has his horse
shot under him storms through successfully by the other side of
Hochkirch Hochkirch to his leftbut finds as the mist gradually
sinks a ring of Austrians massed ahead on the

Heights as far as Steindorfel and farther a general continent of
Austrians enclosing all the south and southwest and in fact that here
is now nothing to be done That the question of his flank is settled
that the question now is of his front which the appointed Austrian
parties are now upon attacking Question especially of the Heights of
Drehsa and of the Pass and Brook of Drehsa rearward of his centre
part where his one retreat will lie Steindorfel being now lost Part
first of the Affair is ended Part second of it begins

Rapidly enough Friedrich takes his new measures Seizes Drehsa Height
which will now be key of the field despatches Mollendorf thither
Mollendorf our courageous Leuthen friend who vigorously bestirs
himself gets hold of Drehsa Height before the enemy can Ziethen
cooperating on the Heights of Kumschutz Canitz and other points of
vantage And thus in effect Friedrich pulls up his torn right skirt
as he is doing all his other skirts into new compact front against the
Austrians so that in that southwestern part especially the Austrians
do not try it farther but retire at full gallop on sight of this
swift seizure of the Keys by Mollendorf and Ziethen Friedrich also
despatches instant order to Retzow to join him at his speediest
Friedrich everywhere rearranges himself hither thither with skilful
rapidity in new Line of Battle still hopeful to dispute what is left
of the fieldlonging much that Retzow could come on wings

By this time towards eight if I might guess Day has got the upper
hand the Daun Austrians stand visible on their Ring of Heights all
round behind Hochkirch and our late Battery on to westward and
northward as far as Steindorfel and Waditzextremely busy rearranging
themselves into something of line there being much confusion much
simmering about in clumps and gaps after such a tussle In front of us
to eastward the appointed Austrian parties are proceeding to attack
but in daylight and with our eyes open it is a thing of difficulty
and does not prosper as Hochkirch did Duke DAhremberg on their
extreme right had in charge to burst in upon our left so soon as he
saw Hochkirch done DAhremberg does try as do others in their places
near Daun but with comparatively little success DAhremberg meeting
something of check or hindrance where he tried pauses for a good
while till he see how others prosper Their grand chance is their
superiority of number and the fact that Friedrich can try nothing upon
THEM but must stand painfully on the defensive till Retzow come
To Friedrich Retzow seems hugely slow about it But the truth is
BadenDurlach with his 20000 of Reserve has as per order made
attack on Retzow 20000 against 12 one of the feeblest attacks
conceivable but sufficient to detain Retzow till he get it repulsed
Retzow is diligent as Time and will be here

Meanwhile the Austrians on front do in a sporadic way attack and
again attack our batteries and posts especially that big Battery of
Thirty Guns which we have to north of Rodewitz The Austrians do take
that Battery at last and are beginning again to be dangerousthe
rather as DAhremberg seems again to be thinking of business It is high
time Retzow were here Few sights could be gladder to Friedrich than
the first glitter of Retzows vanguardhorse under Prince Eugen of
Wurtembergbeautifully wending down from Weissenberg yonder skilfully
posting themselves at Belgern and elsewhere as thorns in the sides of
DAhremberg sharp enough on trial by DAhremberg Followed before
long by Retzow himself serenely crossing Lobau Water and with great
celerity and the best of skill likewise posting himselfhopelessly
to DAhremberg who tries nothing farther The sun is now shining it is
now ten of the day Had Retzow come an hour soonerefore we lost that
big Battery and other things But he could come no sooner be thankful
he is here at last in such an overawing manner

Friedrich judging that nothing now can be made of the affair orders
retreat Retreat which had been getting schemed I suppose and planned
in the gloom of the royal mind ever since loss of that big Battery
at Rodewitz Little to occupy him in this interim except indignant
waiting rigorously steady and some languid interchange of cannonshot
between the parties Retreat is to KleinBautzen neighborhood new
headquarter Doberschutz outposts Kreckwitz and Purschwitz four miles
or so to northwest Rather a shifting of your ground which astonishes
the military reader ever since than a retreating such as the common
run of us expected Done in the usual masterly manner part after part
mending off Retzow standing minatory here Mollendorf minatory there
in the softest quasirhythmic sequence Cavalry all drawn out between
Belgern and Kreckwitz baggagewagons filing through the Pass of
Drehsanot an Austrian meddling with it less or more Daun and his
Austrians standing in their ring of five miles gazing into it like
stone statues their regiments being still in a confused stateand
their Daun an extremely slow gentleman Tempelhof ii 319336

And in this manner Friedrich like a careless swimmer caught in the
Mahlstrom has not got swallowed in it but has made such a buffeting
of it he is here out of it again without bone brokennot we hope
without instruction from the adventure He has lost 101 pieces of
cannon most of his tents and campfurniture and what is more
irreparable above 8000 of his brave people 5381 of them and 119
Officers Keith and Moritz for two either dead or captive In men the
Austrian loss it seems is not much lower some say is rather a shade
higher by their own account 325 Officers 5614 rank and file killed
and woundednot reckoning 1000 prisoners they lost to us and at
least 2000 who took that chance of deserting in the intricate dark
woods Tempelhof ii 336 but see Kausler p 576

Friedrich all say took his punishment in a wonderfully cheerful
manner De Catt the Reader entering to him that evening as usual the
King advanced in a tragic declamatory attitude and gave him with
proper voice and gesture an appropriate passage of Racine

 Enfin apres un an tu me revois Arbate
 Non plus comme autrefois cet heureux Mithridate
 Qui de Rome toujours balancant le destin
 Tenait entre elle et moi lunivers incertain
 Je suis vaincu Pompee a saisi lavantage
 Dune nuit qui laissait peu de place au courage
 Mes soldats presque nus dans

Not a little to De Catts comfort Rodenbeck i 354 During the
retreat itself Retzow Junior had come as Papas AidedeCamp with a
message to the King found him on the heights of Klein Bautzen watching
the movements Message done with the King said in a smiling tone
Daun has played me a slippery trick today I have seen it answered
Retzow but it is only a scratch which your Majesty will soon manage
to heal againGLAUBT ER DIES Do you think so Not only I but the
whole Army firmly believe it of your MajestyYou are quite right
added the King in a confidentially candid way We will manage Daun
What I lament is the number of brave men that have died this morning
Retzow i 359 n On the morrow he was heard to say publicly Daun
has let us out of checkmate the game is not lost yet We will rest
ourselves here a few days then go for Silesia and deliver Neisse
The AnecdoteBooks perhaps not mythically add this Where are all
your guns though said the King to an Artilleryman standing vacant
on parade next day IHRO MAJESTAT the Devil stole them all last
nightHm well we must have them back from him Archenholtz i

less black as sudden universal hurricane on the heart of the man a
sorrow sacred yet immeasurable irremediable to him as if the sky
too were falling on his head in aid of the mean earth and its
raveningsof all this there can nothing be said at present
Friedrichs one relief seems to have been the necessity laid on him of
perpetual battling with outward businesswe may fancy in the rapid
weeks following how much was lying at all times in the background of
his mind suppressed into its caves

Daun it appears was considerably elated spent a great deal of
his time so precious just at present in writing despatches in
congratulating and being congratulateddid an elaborate TEDEUM or
Ambrosian Song in Artillery and VOX HUMANAwhich with the adjuncts
say splenetic people as at Kolin sensibly assisted Friedrichs
affairs Daun was by no means of braggart turn but the recognition of
his matchless achievement by the gazetteer public whether in exultation
or in lamentation was loud and universal and the joy in Vienna and
the cognate quarters knew no bounds for the time being Thus among
other tokens the Holiness of our Lord the Pope blessing Heaven for
such success against the Heretic was pleased to send him a Consecrated

SEQUEL OF HOCHKIRCH THE CAMPAIGN ENDS IN A WAY SURPRISING TO AN
ATTENTIVE PUBLIC 22d October20th November 1758

There followed upon Hochkirch five weeks of rapid events such as
nobody had been calculating on To the reader so weary of marchings
manoeuvrings surprisals campings and details of war not many words
we hope may render these results conceivable

Friedrich stayed ten days refitting himself in that Camp of
KleinBautzen on one of the branches of the Spree Daun who had
retired to his old strong place on the 14th scarcely occupying
Hochkirch Field at all came out in about a week and took a strong post
near Friedrich not attempting anything upon him but watching him now
better within sight Friedrichs fixed intention is to march to Neisse
all the same what probably Daun under the shadow of his laurels and
his new Papal Hat may not have considered possible with the road to
Neisse blocked by 80000 men Friedrich has refitted himself with the
requisite new cannon and furnitures from Dresden especially with
Prince Henri and 6000 foot and horseled by Prince Henri in person
so Prince Henri would have it the capricious little man and that Finck
should be left in Saxony instead of him All which weakens Saxony not a
little But Friedrich hopes the Reichs Army is a feeble article ill off
for provision in those parts and not likely to attempt very much on the
sudden Accordingly




FRIEDRICH MARCHES ENIGMATICALLY NOT ON GLOGAU BUT ON REICHENBACH AND
GORLITZ TO DAUNS ASTONISHMENT

SUNDAY EVENING OCTOBER 22d Convoy of many wagons quit Bautzen Bautzen
Proper not the Village but the Town laden with all the wounded of
Hochkirch above 3000 by count to carry them to Dresden for deliberate
surgery Keiths Tebay I perceive is in this Convoy not ill hurt but
willing to lie in Hospital a little and consider These poor fellows
cannot get to Dresden on the second day a Daun Detachment hussaring
about in those parts is announced ahead and by new order from
headquarters the Convoy turns northwards for Hoyerswerdato Tebays
disgust with the Commandant shied off says Tebay for twelve
hussars Second LETTER from Tebay in Mitchell ubi supraand I
think in the end went on to Glogau instead of Dresden Which was very
fortunate for Tebay and the others The poor wounded being thus disposed
of Friedrich next night at 10 oclock Monday 23d in the softest
manner pushes off his Bakery and Army Stores a little way northward
down the Spree Valley on the western fork of the Spree fork farthest
from Daun follows himself with the rest of the Army next evening
down the eastern fork also northward Going for Glogau thinks Daun
when the hussars report about it late on Tuesday night Let him go
if he fancy that a road TO Neisse But indeed what other shift has
he considers Daun but to try rallying at Glogau yonder safe under
the gunsand is not in the slightest haste about this new matter
Tempelhof ii 341347

United with his baggagecolumn Friedrich proceeds northeastward
crosses Spree still northward or northeastward encamps there in the
dark hours of Tuesday no Daun heeding him Before daylight however
Friedrich is again on foot in several columns now for the bad
countryroads aheadand has struck straight SOUTHeastward if Daun
were noting him And in the afternoon of Wednesday Daun is astonished
to learn that this wily Enemy is arrived in Reichenbach vicinity
sweeping in our poor posts thereabouts immovably astride of the
Silesian Highway after all An astonished Daun hastens out what he
can to take survey of the sudden Phenomenon Tries it next day and
next with his best Loudons and appliances finds that this Phenomenon
can actually march to Neisse ahead of him indifferent to Pandours or
giving them as good as they bringand that nothing but a battle and
beating could we rashly dream of such a thing which we cannot
will prevent it Very well then Daun strives to say And lets the
Phenomenon march FROM Gorlitz OCTOBER 30th Loudon harassing the
rear of it for some days not without counter harassment much waste
of cannonading and ruin to several poor Lausitz Villages by
firePrussians scandalously burn them when we attack says Loudon
Till at last finding this march impregnably arranged split into
two routes and ready for all chances Loudon also withdraws to more
promising business Poor General Retzow Senior was of this march
absolutely could not be excused though fallen ill of dysentery like
to dieand did die the day after he got to Schweidnitz when the
difficulties and excitement were over Retzow i 372

Of Friedrichs march onward from Gorlitz we shall say nothing farther
except that the very wind of it was salvatory to his Silesian Fortresses
and interests That at Neisse on and after November 1stwhich is the
third or second day of Friedrichs marchGeneral Treskow Commandant
of Neisse found the bombardment slacken more and more King of Prussia
coming said the Austrian deserters to us and that on November 6th
Treskow looking out from Neisse found the Austrian trenches empty
Generals Harsch and Deville hurrying over the Hills homewardspickings
to be had of them by Treskowand Neisse Siege a thing finished

FELDMARSCHALL DAUN AND THE REICHS ARMY TRY SOME SIEGE OF DRESDEN
9th16th November

OCTOBER 30th Daun seeing Neisse Siege as good as gone to water
decided with himself that he could still do a far more important stroke
capture Dresden get hold of Saxony in Friedrichs absence Daun turned
round from Reichenbach accordingly and at his slowfooted pace
addressed himself to that new errand Had he made better despatch
or even been in better luck it is very possible he might have done
something there In Dresden and in Governor Schmettau with his small
garrison there is no strength for a siege in Saxony is nothing but
some poor remnant under Finck much of it Freecorps and light people
capable of being swallowed by the Reichs Army itselfwere the Reichs
Army enterprising or in good circumstances otherwise It is true the
Russians have quitted Colberg as impossible and are flowing homewards
dragged by hunger the little Dohna Army will therefore march for
Saxony the little AntiSwedish Army under Wedell has likewise been
mostly ordered thither both at their quickest For Daun all turns on
despatch loiter a little and Friedrich himself will be here again

Daun I have no doubt stirred his slow feet the fastest he could
NOVEMBER 7th Daun was in the neighborhood of Pirna Country again had
his Bridge at Pirna for communication urged the Reichs Army to bestir
itself Now or never Reichs Army did push out a little against
Finck made him leave that perpetual Camp of Gahmig take new camps
Kesselsdorf and elsewhere and at length made him shoot across Elbe to
the northwest on a pontoon bridge below Dresden with retreating room
to northward and shelter under the guns of that City Reichs Army
has likewise made powerful detachments for capture of Leipzig and the
northwestern towns capture of Torgau the Magazine town first of all
summon them with force evidently overpowering Free withdrawal if you
dont resist and if you do At Torgau there was actual attempt made
November 12th rather elaborate and dangerous looking under Haddick
with near 10000 of the Austrianauxiliary sort to whom the old
Commandantjudging Wedell the late AntiSwedish Wedell to be now
nearrushed out with 300 men and one big gun and made such a firing
and gesticulation as was quite extraordinary as if Wedell were here
already till Wedells self did come in sight and the overpowering
Reichs Detachment made its best speed elsewhither Tempelhof c
Letter from a Prussian Officer in _HeldenGeschichte_ v 286 The
other Sieges remained things of theory the other Reichs Detachments
hurried home I think without summoning anybody

Meanwhile Daun with the proper Artilleries at last ready comes
flowing forward NOVEMBER 8th9th and takes post in the Great Garden
or south side of Dresden minatory to Schmettau and that City The
walls or works are weak outside there is nothing but Mayer and the
Free Corps to resist who indeed has surpassed himself this season and
been extraordinarily diligent upon that lazy Reichs Army Commandant
Schmettau signifies to Daun the day Daun came in sight If your
Excellenz advance farther on me the grim Rules of War in besieged
places will order That I burn the Suburbs which are your defences
in attacking meand actually fills the fine houses on the Southern
Suburb with combustible matter making due announcements to Court and
population as well as to Dann Burn the Suburbs answers Daun In
the name of civilized humanity you will never think of such thing
That will I your Excellenz of a surety and do it answers
Schmettau So that Dresden is full of pity terror and speculation The
common rumor is says Excellency Mitchell who is sojourning there for
the present That Bruhl nefarious Bruhl born to be the death of
us has persuaded Polish Majesty to sanction this enterprise of
Daunsvery careless Bruhl what become of Dresden or us so the
King of Prussia be well hurt or spited

Certain enough NOVEMBER 9th Daun does come on regardless of
Schmettaus assurances so that about midnight Mayer who can hear
the enemy busily building four big batteries withal has to report
himself driven to the edge of those high Houses which are filled with
combustibles and that some Croats are got into the upper windows
Burn them then answers Schmettasu such the dire necessity of sieged
places and at 3 AM three hours notice to the poor inmates
Mayer does so hideous flames bursting out punctually at the stroke of
3 whole Suburb seemed on blaze about a sixth part of it actually
so nay you would have said the whole Town was environed in flames
Excellency Mitchell climbed a steeple will not describe to your
Lordship the horror the terror and confusion of this night wretched
inhabitants running with their furniture what of it they had got flung
out between 12 oclock and 3 towards the Great Garden all Dresden to
appearance girt in flames ruins and smoke Such a night in Dresden
especially in the Pirna Suburb as was never seen before Mitchell
_Memoirs and Papers_ i 459 In _HeldenGeschichte_ v 295302 minute
account corresponding well with Mitchells ib 303333 the certified
details of the damage done 280 houses lost 4 human lives This
was the sad beginning or attempt at beginning of Dresden Siege and
this also was the end of it on Dauns part at present For four days
more he hung about the place minatory hesitative but attempted
nothing feasible and on the fifth dayfor a certain weighty reason
as the Austrian Gazettes express ithe saw good to vanish into the
Pirna RockCountry and be out of harms way in the mean while

The Truth is Dauns was an intricate case just now needing above all
things swiftness of treatment what of all things it could not get
from Daun His denunciations on that burnt Suburb were again loud but
Schmettau continues deaf to all thatmeans to defend himself by the
known rules of war and of honor declares he will dispute from street
to street and only finish in the middle of Polish Majestys Royal
Palace Denunciation will do nothing Daun had above 100000 men in
those parts Rushing forward with sharp shot and bayonet storm instead
of logical denunciation it is probable Daun might have settled his
Schmettau But the hour of tide was rigorous withaland such an ebb
if you missed it in hesitating NOVEMBER 15th Daun withdrew the ebbing
come That same day Friedrich was at Lauban in the Lausitz within a
hundred miles again speeding hitherward behind him a Silesia brushed
clear before him a Saxony to be brushed Reason weighty enough think
Daun and the Austrian Gazettes But such since you have missed the
tidehour is the inexorable fact of ebbgoing at that frightful rate
Daun never was the man to dispute facts

November 20th Friedrich arrived in Dresden heard next day that Daun
had wheeled decisively homeward from Pirna Country that the Reichs Army
and he are diligently climbing the Metal Mountains and that there is
not in Saxony more than in Silesia an enemy left What a Sequel to
Hochkirch Neisse and Dresden both we had hoped as sequel if lucky
Neisse OR Dresden seemed infallible And we are climbing the Metal
Mountains under facts superior to us

And Campaign Third has closed in this mannerleaving things much as it
found them Essentially a drawn match Contending Parties little altered
in relative strengthboth of them it may be presumed considerably
weaker Friedrich is not triumphant or shining in the light of
bonfires as last Year but in the mind of judges stands higher than
ever if that could help him muchand is not annihilated in the
least which is the surprising circumstance

Friedrichs marches especially have been wonderful this Year In
the springtime old Marechal de Belleisle French Minister of War
consulting officially about future operations heard it objected once
But if the King of Prussia were to burst in upon us there The King
of Prussia is a great soldier answered M de Belleisle but his Army
is not a shuttle NAVETTEto be shot about in that way from side
to side of the world No surely not altogether But the King of Prussia
has among other arts an art of marching Armies which by degrees
astonishes the old Marechal To come upon us EN NAVETTE suddenly
like a shuttle from the other side of the web became an established
phrase among the French concerned in these unfortunate matters
Archenholtz i 316 Montalembert SAEPIUS for the phrase EN
NAVETTE

The PittandFerdinand Campaign of 1758 says a Note which I would
fain abridge is more palpably victorious than Friedrichs much more
an affair of bonfires than his though it too has had its rubs Loss of
honor at Crefeld loss of Louisburg and Codfishery these are serious
blows our enemy has had But then to temper the joy over Louisburg
there was at Ticonderoga by Abercrombie on the small scale all
the extent of scale he had a melancholy Platitude committed that of
walking into an enemy without the least reconnoitring of him who proves
to be chindeep in abatis and fieldworks and kills much at his ease
about 2000 brave fellows brought 5000 miles for that object And
obliges you to walk away on the instant and quit Ticonderoga like
asurely like a very tragic Dignitary in Cockedhat To be cashiered
we will hope at least to be laid on the shelf and replaced by some
Wolfe or some Amherst fitter for the business Nor were the Descents on
the French Coast much to speak of Great Guns got at Cherbourg these
truly as exhibited in HydePark were a comfortable sight especially
to the simpler sort but on the other hand at Morlaix on the part of
poor old General Bligh and Company there had been a Platitude equal or
superior to that of Abercrombie though not so tragical in loss of men
What of that said an enthusiastic Public striking their balance and
joyfully illuminatingHere is a Clipping from Ohio Country LETTER
of an Officer distilled essence of Two Letters dated FORTDUQUESNE
28th NOVEMBER 1758

Our small Corps under General Forbes after much sore scrambling
through the Wildernesses and contending with enemies wild and tame
is since the last four days in possession of Fort Duquesne PITTSBURG
henceforth Friday 24th the French garrison on our appearance made
off without fighting took to boats down the Ohio and vanished out
of those Countriesforever and a day we will hope Their
LouisianaCanada communication is lost and all that prodigious tract of
rich countrywhich Mr Washington fixed upon long ago is ours
again if we can turn it to use This day a detachment of us goes to
Braddocks field of battle poor Braddock to bury the bones of our
slaughtered countrymen many of whom the French butchered in cold blood
and to their own eternal shame and infamy have left lying above ground
ever since As indeed they have done with all those slain round the
Fort in late weekscalling themselves a civilized Nation too Old

LOWER RHINE JULYNOVEMBER 1758 Ferdinands manoeuvres after
Crefeld on the Franceward side of Rhine were very pretty but
without Wesel and versus a Belleisle as WarMinister and a Contades
who was something of a General it would not do Belleisle made uncommon
exertions diligent to get his broken people drilled again Contades
was wary and countermanoeuvred rather well Finally Soubise readers
recollect him and his 24 or 30000 who stood in Frankfurt Country on
the hither or north side of Rhine famed Rossbach Soubisepushing
out at Belleisles bidding towards Hanover in a region vacant
otherwise of troopsbecame dangerous to Ferdinand Making for
Hanover thought Ferdinand Or perhaps meaning to attack my 12000
English that are just landed Nay perhaps my RhineBridge itself and
the small Party left there Ferdinand found he would have to return
and look after Soubise Crossed accordingly August 8th by his old
Bridge at Reeswhich he found safe in spite of attempts there had
been Fight of Meer Chevert with 10000 beaten off and the Bridge
saved by Imhof with 3000both clever soldiers Imhof in better
luck and favored by the ground 5th August 1758 MAUVILLON i
315and never recrossed during this War Judges even say his first
crossing had never much solidity of outlook in it and though so
delightful to the public was his questionablest step

On the 12000 English Soubise had attempted nothing Ferdinand joined
his English at Soest August 20th to their great joy and his Duke
of Marlboroughs heavyladen LETTER to Pitt Koesfeld August 15th
Nothing but rains and uncertainties marching latterly up to our
middles in water have come from Embden straight south towards Wesel
Country almost 150 miles Soest still a good sixty miles to southeast
of us CHATHAM CORRESPONDENCE London 1838 i 334 337 The poor
Duke died in two months hence and the command devolved on Lord
George Sackville as is too well known 10 to 12000 as a first
instalmentGrandlooking fellows said the Germans And did you ever
see such horses such splendor of equipment regardless of expense Not
to mention those BERGSCHOTTEN Scotch Highlanders with their bagpipes
sporrans kilts and exotic costumes and ways astonishing to the German
mind Romantic view of the BERGSCHOTTEN 2000 of them led by the
Junior of the Robert Keiths above mentioned who is a soldier as yet
in ARCHENHOLTZ i 351353 IB and in PREUSS ii 136 of the uniforms
with gold and silver lace of the superb horses one regiment all
roan horses another all black another all c Out of all whom
BERGSCHOTTEN included Ferdinand by managementand management
was neededgot a great deal of firstrate fighting in the next Four
Years

Nor in regard to Hanover could Soubise make anything of it though
he did owing to a couple of stupid fellows General Prince von Ysenburg
and General Oberg detached by Ferdinand on that service escape the
lively treatment Ferdinand had prepared for him and even gave a kind
of Beating to each of those stupid fellows 1 Fight of Sandershausen
Broglio as Soubises vanguard 12000 VERSUS Ysenburg 7000 who
stupidly would not withdraw TILL beaten 23d July 1758 BEFORE
Ferdinand had come across again 2 Fight of Lutternberg Soubise
30000 VERSUS Oberg about 18000 who stupidly hung back till Soubise
was all gathered and THEN c still more stupidly 10th October
1758 See MAUVILLON i 312 or better ARCHENHOLTZ i 345 and
MAUVILLON i 327 Both Lutternberg and Sandershausen are in the
neighborhood of Casselas many of those Ferdinand fights wereone
of which Obergs one might have ruined Oberg and his Detachment
altogether had Soubise been alert which he by no means was Paris
made such jeering about Rossbach and the Prince de Soubise says
Voltaire _Histoire de Louis XV_  and nobody said a word about these
two Victories of his next Year For which there might be two reasons
one according to Tempelhof that the Victories were of the soso
kind SIC WAREN AUCH DARNACH and another that they were ascribed to
Broglio on both occasionshow justly nobody will now argue

Contades had not failed in the mean while to follow with the
main Army and was now elaborately manoeuvring about intent to have
Lippstadt or some Fortress in those RhineWeser Countries On the tail
of that second soso Victory by Soubise Contades thought Now would be
the chance And did try hard but without effect Ferdinand was himself
attending Contades and mistakes were not likely Ferdinand in the
thick of the game October 21st30th made a masterly movementthat
is to say cut Contades and his Soubise irretrievably asunder
no junction now possible to them the weaker of them liable to
ruinunless Contades the stronger would give battle which though
greatly outnumbering Ferdinand he was cautious not to do A melancholic
cautious man apt to be overcautiousnicknamed LAPOTHECAIRE by the
Parisians from his down looksbut had good soldier qualities withal
Soubise and he haggled about a short whilenot a long in these
dangerous circumstances and then had to go home again without result
each the way he came Contades himself repassing through Wesel and
wintering on his own side of the Rhine

How Pitt is succeeding and aiming to succeed on the French Foreign
Settlements on the Guinea Coast on the High Seas everywhere in the
West Indies still more in the Eastwhere General Lally that fiery
OMuLLALLY famous since Fontenoy missioned with fullpowers as
they call them is raging up and down about Madras and neighborhood in
a violent impetuous more and more bankrupt mannerOf all this we can
say nothing for the present little at any time Here are two facts
of the financial sort sufficiently illuminative The muchexpending
muchsubsidying Government of France cannot now borrow except at 7 per
cent Interest and the rate of Marine Insurance has risen to 70 per
cent Retzow ii 5 One way and other here is a Pitt clearly
progressive and a longpending JENKINSSEAR QUESTION in a fair way to
be settled

Friedrich stays in Saxony about a month inspecting and adjusting
thence to Breslau for Winterquarters His Winter is like to be a sad
and silent one this time with none of the gayeties of last Year the
royal heart heavy enough with many private sorrows were there none of
public at all This is a word from him two days after finishing Daun
for the season


FRIEDRICH TO MYLORD MARISCHAL at Colombier in Neufchatel

DRESDEN 23d November 1758

There is nothing left for us MON CHER MYLORD but to mingle and blend
our weeping for the losses we have had If my head were a fountain of
tears it would not suffice for the grief I feel

Our Campaign is over and there has nothing come of it on one side or
the other but the loss of a great many worthy people the misery of a
great many poor soldiers crippled forever the ruin of some Provinces
the ravage pillage and conflagration of some flourishing Towns
Exploits these which make humanity shudder sad fruits of the wickedness
and ambition of certain People in Power who sacrifice everything to
their unbridled passions I wish you MON CHER MYLORD nothing that has
the least resemblance to my destiny and everything that is wanting to
it Your old friend till deathF _OEuvres de Frederic_ xx 273

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
