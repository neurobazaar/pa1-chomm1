POLYEUCTE

By Pierre Corneille



Translated by Thomas Constable




INTRODUCTORY NOTE

Pierre Corneille was born in Rouen in 1606 the son of an official was
educated by the Jesuits and practised unsuccessfully as a lawyer His
dramatic career began with the comedy of Melite but it was by his
Medee that he first proved his tragic genius The Cid appeared
in 1636 and a series of masterpieces followedHorace Cinna
Polyeucte Le Menteur After a failure in Pertharite he retired
from the stage deeply hurt by the disapproval of his audience Six
years later he resumed play writing with OEdipe and continued till
1674 producing in all some thirty plays Though he earned a great
reputation he was poorly paid and a proud and sensitive nature laid
him open to considerable suffering He died in 1684

The works of Corneille represent most fully the ideal of French
socalled classical tragedy The laws to which this type of tragedy
sought to conform were not so much truth to nature as the principles
which the critics had derived from a somewhat inadequate interpretation
of Aristotle and of the practise of the Greek tragedians These
principles concentrated the interest of the play upon a single central
situation in order to emphasize which subordinate characters and
complicating underplots were avoided as much as possible There was
little or no action upon the stage and the events of the plot were
narrated by messengers or by the main characters in conversation with
confidantes Further the dramatic unities of time and place as well
as of action were held to be binding

One result of these rules was to give an extraordinary importance to
the speeches and it is in the eloquence of these in the grandeur and
dignity of the versification and in the lofty moral elevation of the
characters that Corneille excels All of these qualities are admirably
exemplified in Polyeucte and in the conduct of the leading personages
one may perceive the most persistent trait of this dramatists treatment
of heroic characterthe conquest of the passions by the reason and the
will Among the masterpieces of Corneille says Paul de SaintVictor
Polyeucte is assuredly the greatest and nothing in all his dramas
equals the extraordinary beauty of the character of Pauline

ACT IPOLYEUCTE NEARCHUS

 NEARCHUS
 Shall womans dream of terror hurl the dart
 Oh feeble weapon gainst so great a heart
 Must courage proved a thousand times in arms
 Bow to a peril forged by vain alarms

 POLY
 I know that dreams are born to fade away
 And melt in air before the light of day
 I know that misty vapours of the night
 Dissolve and fly before the morning bright
 The dream is naughtbut the dear dreamerall
 She has my soul Nearchus fast in thrall
 Who holds the marriage torchaugust divine
 Bids me to her sweet voice my will resign
 She fears my deaththo baseless this her fright
 Pauline is wrung with fearby dayby night
 My road to duty hampered by her fears
 How can I go when all undried her tears
 Her terror I disownand all alarms
 Yet pity holds me in her loving arms
 No bolts or bars imprisonyet her sighs
 My fetters aremy conquerors her eyes
 Say kind Nearchus is the cause you press
 Such as to make me deaf to her distress
 The bonds I slacken I would not unloose
 Nothing I yieldyet grant a timely truce

 NEAR
 How grant you know not what Are you assured
 Of constancyas one who has endured
 God claims your soul for HimNow Now Today
 The fruit tomorrow yieldsoh who shall say
 Our God is just but do His grace and power
 Descend on recreants with equal shower
 On darkened souls His flame of light He turns
 Yet flame neglected soon but faintly burns
 And dying embers fade to ashes cold
 If we the heart His spirit wooes withhold
 Great Heaven retains the fire no longer sought
 While ashes turn to dust and dust to naught
 His holy baptism He bids thee seek
 Neglect the call and the desire grows weak
 Ah whilst from womans breast thou heedst the sighs
 The flame first flickers then untendeddies

 POLY
 You know me illtis mine that holy fire
 Fed not extinguished by unslaked desire
 Her tearsI view them with a lovers eye
 And yet your Christ is minea Christian I
 The healing cleansing flood oer me shall flow
 I would efface the stain from birth I owe
 I would be puremy sealed eyes would see
 The birthright Adam lost restored to me
 This this the unfading crown For this I yearn
 For that exhaustless fount I thirst I burn
 Then since my heart is true Nearchus say
 Shall I not grant to pity this delay

 NEAR
 So doth the ghostly foe our souls abuse
 And all beyond his force he gains by ruse
 He hates the purpose fast he cannot foil
 Then he retreatsretreats but to recoil
 In endless barricade obstruction piles
 Today tis tears impede tomorrowsmiles
 And this poor dreamhis coinage of the night
 Gives place to other lures all falsely bright
 All tricks he knows and usesthreats and prayers
 Attacks in parleyas the Parthian dares
 In chain unheeded weakest link must fail
 So fortress yet unwon hell mount and scale
 O break his bonds Let feeble woman weep
 The heart that God has touched tis God must keep
 Who looks behind to dally with his choice
 When Heaven demandsobeys another voice

 POLY
 Who loves thy Christsay must he love no other

 NEAR
 He mayhe must Tis Christ says Love thy brother
 Yet on the altar of the Heavenly King
 No rival place no alien incense fling
 Through Himby Himfor Himall goodness know
 Tis from the source alone each stream must flow
 To please Him wife and wealth and rank and state
 Must be forsakenstrait the heavenly gate
 Poor silly sheep afar you err and stray
 From Him who is The Life The Truth The Way
 My grief chokes utterance I see your fate
 As round the fold the hungry wolves of hate
 Closer and fiercer rage from sword and flame
 One shelter for His flockone only Name
 The Cross alone our victor over fears
 Not this thy strengththy pleaa womans tears

 POLY
 I know thy heart It is mine ownthe tear
 My pity drops hath neer a taint of fear
 Who dreads not torture yetto give relief
 To her he loves perforce must ease her grief
 If Heaven should claim my life my death my all
 Then Heaven will give the strength to heed the call
 The shepherd guides me surely to the fold
 There safe with Him tis He will make me bold

 NEAR
 Be bold O come

 POLY
 Yes let thy faith be mine
 Thereat his feetdo I my life resign
 If but Paulinemy lovewould give consent
 Else heaven were hell and home but banishment

 NEAR
 Cometo return Thrice welcome to her sight
 To see thee safe will double her delight
 As the pierced cloud unveils a brighter sun
 So is her joy enhancedthy glory won
 O come they wait

 POLY
 Appease her fear Ah this
 Alone will give her resther lover bliss
 She comes

 NEAR
 Then fly

 POLY
 I cannot

 NEAR
 To deny would yield thine enemy the victory
 He loves to kill and knows his deadliest dart
 Finds friend within the fortthy traitor heart

 Enter Pauline and Stratonice

 POLY
 I needs must go Pauline My love goodbye
 I go but to returnfor thine am I

 PAUL
 Oh why this haste to leave a loving wife
 Doth honour callor fearst thou for thy life

 POLY
 For more a thousandfold

 PAUL
 Great Gods above

 POLY
 Thou hast my heart Let this content thy love

 PAUL
 You love and yet you leave me What am I
 Not mine to solve the dreary mystery

 POLY
 I love thee more than selfthan lifethan fame
 But

 PAUL
 There is something that thou darst not name
 Oh on my knees I supplicate I pray
 Remove my darknessturn my night to day

 POLY
 Oh dreams are naught

 PAUL
 Yet when they tell of thee
 I needs must listen for I love Ah me

 POLY
 Take courage dear one tis but for an hour
 Thy love must draw me back for love hath power
 Oer all in earth and heaven My souls delight
 I can no more My only safetyflight

 Exeunt Polyeucte and Nearchus

 PAUL
 Yes go despise my prayermy agony
 Go ruthlessmeet thy fateforewarned by me
 Chase thy pursuer herald thine own doom
 Go kiss the murderers hand and hail the tomb
 Ah Stratonice for our boasted power
 As sovereigns oer mans heart Poor regents of an hour
 Faint helpless moonbeamlight was all I gave
 The sun breaks forthhis queen becomes his slave
 Wooed Yes as other queens I held my court
 Wonbut to lose my crown and be the sport
 Of proud absorbing and imperious man

 STRAT
 Ah man does what he willswe what we can
 He loves thee lady

 PAUL
 Love should mate with trusts
 He leaves me

 STRAT
 Lady tis because he must
 He loves thee with a love will never die
 Then if he leave thee reason not the why
 Give him thy trust Oh thou shalt have reward
 For thee he hides the secret Let him guard
 Thy life belovedin fullest liberty
 The wife who wholly trusts alone is free
 One heart for thee and himone purpose sure
 Yet this heart beats to dareand to endure
 The wifes true heart must oer the peril sigh
 Which meets his heart moved but to purpose high
 Thy pain his pain but not his terror thine
 He is Armenian thou of Roman line
 We of Armenia mock thy dreams to scorn
 For they are born of night as truth of morn
 While Romans hold that dreams are heavensent
 And spring from Jove for mans admonishment

 PAUL
 Though this thy faithif thou my dream shouldst hear
 My grief must needs be thine thy fear my fear
 And that the horror thou mayst fully prove
 Know that Ihis dear wifedid once another love
 Nay start not shrink not tis no tale of shame
 For though in other years the heavenly flame
 Descended kindled scorchedit left me pure
 With courage to resignwith strength to endure
 He touched my heart but never stained the soul
 That gained this hardest conquestselfcontrol
 At Romewhere I was borna soldiers eye
 Marked this poor face from which must Polyeucte fly
 Severus was his nameAh memory
 May spare love linked with death a tear a sigh

 STRAT
 Say is it he who at the risk of life
 Saved Decius from his foes and endless strife
 Who dying dealt to Persia stroke of death
 And shouted Victory with his latest breath
 His whitening bones amid the nameless brave
 Lie still unfound unknown without a grave
 Unburied lies his dust amid the slain
 While Decius rears an empty urn in vain

 PAUL
 Alas tis he all Rome attests his worth
 Hide not his memory kindly Mother Earth
 Tis but his memory that I adore
 The past is pastand I can say no more
 All gifts save one had heyes Fortune held her hand
 And I as Fortunes slave obeyed my sires command

 STRAT
 Ah I must wish that love the day had won

 PAUL
 Which duty lostthen had I been undone
 Though duty gave yet duty healed my pain
 Yet say not that my love was weak or vain
 Our tears fell fast yet neer bore our distress
 The fatal fruit of strife and bitterness
 Then then I left my hero hope and Rome
 And far from him I found another home
 While he in his despair sought sure relief
 In death the only end to lifes long grief
 You know the restyou know that Polyeuctes eye
 Was caughthis fancy pleased his wife am I
 Once more by counsel of my father led
 To Armenias greatest noble am I wed
 Ambition prudence policy his guide
 Yet only duty made Pauline his bride
 Love might have bound me to Severus heart
 Had duty not enforced a sterner part
 Yes let these fears attest all trembling for his life
 That I am his for ayehis faithful loving wife

 STRAT
 Thy new love true and tender as the old
 But this thy dream No more thy tale withhold

 PAUL
 Last night I saw Severus but his eye
 With anger blazed his port was proud and high
 No suppliant heno feeble formless shade
 With dim averted eye no sword had made
 My hero lifeless ghost Nor wound nor scar
 Marked death his only conqueror in war
 Nor spoil of death nor memorys child was he
 His mien triumphant full of majesty
 So might victorious Caesar near his home
 To claim the key to every heart in Rome
 He spoke in nameless awe I heard his voice
 Give love that is my due to himthy choice
 But know oh faithless one ere day expires
 All vain these tears for him thy heart desires
 Anon a Christian band an impious horde
 With shameful cross in hand attest his word
 They vouch Severus truthand to complete
 My doom hurl Polyeucte beneath his feet
 I cried O father timely succour bear
 He heard he came my grief was now despair
 He drew his daggerplunged it in the breast
 Of him my husband late his honoured guest
 Relief came but from agony supreme
 I shriekedI writhedI wokeit was a dream
 And yet my dream is true

 STRAT
 Tis true your dream is sad
 But now you are awake tis but a dream you had
 For horrors prey in darkness of the night
 Is but our reasons sport in morning light
 How can you dread a shade How a fond father fear
 Who as a son regards the man you hold so dear
 To phantom of the night no credence yield
 For him and you he chose thy strength and shield

 PAUL
 You say _his_ words at all my fears he smiles
 But I must dread these Christians and their wiles
 I dread their vengeance wreaked upon my lord
 For Christian blood my father has outpoured

 STRAT
 Their sect is impious mad absurd and vain
 Their rites repulsive as their cult profane
 Deride their altar their weak frenzy ban
 Yet do they war with gods and not with man
 Relentless wills our law that they must die
 Their joyendurance deaththeir ecstasy
 Judgedby decree the foes of human race
 Meekly their heads they bowto court disgrace

 PAUL
 My father comesoh peace

 Enter Felix and Albin

 FELIX
 Nay peace is flown
 Thy dream begets dull fears till now unknown
 In part this dream is true and for the rest

 PAUL
 By what new fear say is thy heart opprest

 FELIX
 Severus lives

 PAUL
 Ah this no cause for fear

 FELIX
 At Decius court he held in honour dear
 Risked life to save his Emperor from his foes
 Tis to his saviour Decius honour shows

 PAUL
 Thus fickle Fortune bows her head to fate
 And pays the honour due though all too late

 FELIX
 He comes Is near

 PAUL
 The gods

 FELIX
 Do all things well

 PAUL
 My dream fulfilled But how O father tell

 FELIX
 Let Albin speak who saw him face to face
 With tribe of courtiers all to him give place
 Unscathed in battle all extol his fame
 Unstained undimmed his glory life and name

 ALBIN
 You know the issue of that glorious fight
 The crowning glory hiswho in despite
 Of danger sore to life and liberty
 Became a slave to set his Emperor free
 Rome gave her honours to Severus shade
 Whilst he her ransomer in a dungeon stayed
 His death they mourned above ten thousand slain
 While Persia held himyes their tears were vain
 But not in vain his noble sacrifice
 The king released him Rome grudged not the price
 No Persian bribe could tempt him from his home
 When Decius criedFight once again for Rome
 Again he fightshe leadsall others hope resign
 But from despairs deep breast he plucks a star benign
 Thishopes fair fruit contentment plenty ease
 Brings joy from grief to crown a lasting peace
 The Emperor holds him as his dearest friend
 And doth Severus to Armenia send
 To offer up to Mars and mighty Jove
 Mid feast and sacrifice his thanks and love

 FELIX
 Ah Fortune turn thy wheel else I misfortune meet

 ALBIN
 This news I learnd from one of great Severus suite
 Thence swiftly here the tale to tell I sped

 FELIX
 He who once vainly wooed hopes now to wed
 The sacrifice the offering all are feigned
 All but the suit which lightly I disdained

 PAUL
 Yes this may be for ah he loved me well

 FELIX
 What room for hope Such wrath is child of hell
 Before his righteous ire I shrink I cower
 Revenge I dreadand vengeance linked with power
 Unnerves me quite

 PAUL
 Fear not his soul is great

 FELIX
 Thy comfort oh my daughter comes too late
 The thought to crush me down to turn my heart to stone
 This that I prized not worth for worths dear sake alone
 Too well Pauline thou hast thy sire obeyed
 Thy heart was fond but duty love betrayed
 How surely thy revolt had safety won
 Tis thine obedience leaves us all undone
 In thee in thee alone one hope remains
 Love held him fast relax not thou loves chains
 O Love my sometime foe forgive be mine ally
 And let the dart that slew now bring the remedy

 PAUL
 Forbid it Heaven One good yet mine_my will_
 The dart that wounded has the power to kill
 One lesson woman learnsher feebleness
 Shame is the only grief without redress
 The traitor heart shall still a prisoner be
 For freedom were disgrace to thee and me
 _I will not_ see him

 FELIX
 But one word Be kind

 PAUL
 I will not for I loveand love is blind
 Before his kingly eye my soul to unveil
 Were shame and failure and I will not fail
 _I will not_ see him

 FELIX
 One word moreObey
 Wouldst thou thy father and his weal betray

 PAUL
 I yield Come woecome shamecome every ill
 My father thouand I thy daughter still

 FELIX
 I know thee pure

 PAUL
 And pure I will remain
 But crushed and bruised the flower no guilt shall stain
 I fear the combat that I may not fly
 Hardwon the fight and dear the victory
 Here love my curse Here dearest friend my foe
 Yet will I arm me Father I would go
 To steel my heartall weapons to embrace

 FELIX
 I too will go the conquerors march to grace
 Restore thy strength ere yet it be too late
 And know that in thy hands thou holdst our fate

 PAUL
 Go broken heart to probe thy wound cut deep and do not spare
 Herselfthe crowning sacrificethe victim shall prepare




ACT IISEVERUS FABIAN

 SEV
 Let Felix bow to Jove and incense pour
 I seek a dearer shrine for I adore
 Nor Jove nor Mars nor Fortunebut Pauline
 This fruit now ripening late my hand would glean
 You know my friend the god who wings my way
 You know the only goddess I obey
 What reck the gods on high our sacrifice and prayer
 An earthly worship mine sole refuge from despair

 FABIAN
 Ah You may see her

 SEV
 Blessed be thy tongue
 O magic word that turns my grief to song
 Yet if she now forget each fair fond vow
 She loved me oncebut does she love me now
 On that sweet face shall I but trouble see
 Who hope for love undimmed for ecstasy
 Great Decius gives her hand but if her heart
 Be mine no morethan let vain hope depart
 This mandate binds her father only she
 Shall give no captive handher heart is free
 No promise wrung no kings command be mine to claim
 Her love the boon I crave all else an empty name

 FABIAN
 Yesyou maysee her_see_ herthis you may

 SEV
 Thy speech is haltingodious thy delay
 She loves no more I grope O give me light

 FABIAN
 O see her not for painful were the sight
 In Rome each matrons kind In Rome all maids are fair
 Let lips meet other lipsseek for caresses there
 No stately Claudia will refuseno Julia proud disdain
 A hero captures every heart from Antioch to Spain

 SEV
 To wed a queenan empresswere only loss and shame
 One heart for mePaulines One boastthat dearest name
 Her love was virgin gold O neer shall baser metal ring
 From mine who live her name to bless her peerless praise to sing
 O words are naught till that I see her face
 Then doubly naught till I my love embrace
 In every war my hope was placed in death
 Her name upon my lips at every breath
 My rank my fame now hers and hers alone
 What is not hers hers onlyI disown

 FABIAN
 Once more oh see her not twere for thy peace

 SEV
 Thy meaning knave or let this babble cease
 Say was she cold My love My only life

 FABIAN
 Nobutmy lord

 SEV
 Say on

 FABIAN
 Anothers wife

 SEV
 Reels
 HelpNo I will not blenchah say you lie
 If this be trueye godscan I be I

 FABIAN
 No thou art changed Where is thy courage fled

 SEV
 I know not Fabian Lost Gone Vanished Dead
 I thought my strength was oaktis but a reed
 Pauline is wed then am I lost indeed
 Hope hid beyond the cloud yet still fond hope was there
 But now all hope is dead lives only black despair
 Pauline anothers wife

 FABIAN
 Yes Polyeucte is her lord
 He came he saw he conquered thine adored

 SEV
 Her choice is not unworthyhis a name
 Illustrious from a line of kings he came
 Cold comfort for a wound no cure can heal
 My cause is lostforedoomed without appeal
 Malignant Jove to drag me back today
 Relentless Fate to quench hopes dawning ray
 Take back your gifts One boon alone I crave
 That only boon to none deniedthe grave
 Yet would I see her breathe one last goodbye
 Would hear once more that voice before I die
 My latest breath would still my homage pay
 That memory mine when lost to realms of day

 FABIAN
 Yet think my lord

 SEV
 Oh I have thought of all
 What worser ill can dull despair befall
 She will not see me

 FABIAN
 Yes my lord but

 SEV
 Cease

 FABIAN
 Twill but enhance the grief I would appease

 SEV
 For hopeless ill good friend I seek no cure
 Who welcomes death can lifes short pain endure

 FABIAN
 O lost indeed if round her fatal light you hover
 The lover losing all speaks hardly like a lover
 While passion still is lordthe passionswept is slave
 From this last bitterness would I Severus save

 SEV
 That word my friend unsay tho grief this bosom tear
 The hand that wounds I kisslove vanquishes despair
 Fate only not Pauline the foe that I accuse
 No plighted faith she breaks who did this hand refuse
 Dutyher fatherFatethese willed she but obeyed
 Not hers the woe the strife that envious Ate made
 Untimely Fortunes shower must drown me not revive
 Too lavish and too late her fatal gifts arrive
 The golden apple falls the gold is turned to dross
 When Fate at Fortune mocks all gain is only loss

 FABIAN
 Yes I will go to tell her thou hast drained
 To the last drop the cup that Fate ordained
 She knows thee hero but she feared that pain
 Might prove thee also manby passion slain
 She feared Despair who gains the victory
 Oer other men might een thy master be

 SEV
 Peace Peace She comes

 FABIAN
 To thine own self be true

 SEV
 Nay True to her Shall I her life undo
 She loves the Armenian

 Enter Pauline

 PAUL
 Yes that debt I pay
 Hardwrung acquittedhis my love alway
 Who has my hand he holdsshall holdmy heart
 Truth is my guidelet sophistry depart
 Had Fate been kind then had Pauline been thine
 Heart faith and duty linked with bliss divine
 In vain had fickle Fortune barred the way
 Want had been wealth with thee my guide my stay
 And poverty had fallen from the wings
 Of soaring love who mocks the wealth of kings
 Not mine to choose for hemy fathers choice
 Must needs be mine yes when I heard his voice
 Duty must echo be if thou couldst cast
 Before my feet an emperors crowna past
 By worth and glory litbeloved adored
 Yet at my fathers word Not this thy lord
 Take one despisednay loathedto share thy bed
 Him and not thee beloved would I wed
 Duty obedience must have been the part
 Of me who own their sway een with a broken heart

 SEV
 O happy thou O easy remedy
 One poor faint sigh cures loves infirmity
 Thy heart thy tool oer every passion queen
 Beyond all change and chance thou sitst serene
 In easy flow can pass thy love newborn
 From cold indifference to colder scorn
 Such resolution is the equal mate
 Of god or monster love aversion hate
 This finespun adamant Ithuriels spear
 Could never pierce for other stuff is here
 Points to himself
 No faint Alas no swiftrepented sigh
 Can heal the cureless wound from which I die
 Sure reason finds that love his easy prey
 With Lethe aye at hand to point the way
 With ordered fires like thine I too could smother
 A heart in leash find solace in another
 Too fair too dearfrom whom the Fates me sever
 Thou hast no heart to givethou lovdst me never

 PAUL
 Too plain Severus I my torture show
 Tho flame leap up no more the embers glow
 Far other speech and voice and mien were mine
 Could I forget that once thou calldst me thine
 Tho reason rules yes gains the mastery
 No queen benignant but a tyrant she
 Oh if I conquerif the strife I gain
 Yet memory for aye is linked with pain
 I feel the charm that binds me still to thee
 If duty great yet great thy worth to me
 I see thee still the same who waked the fire
 Which waked in me ineffable desire
 Begirt by crown of everlasting fame
 Thou art more gloriousyet art still the same
 I know thy valours worthwell hast thou justified
 That bounding hope of mine though fruitage was denied
 Yet this same fate which did our union ban
 Hath made me fatedwed another man
 Let Duty still be queen Yea let her break
 The heart she pierces yet can never shake
 The virtue once thy pride in days gone by
 Doth that same worth now merit blasphemy
 Bewail her bitter fruitbut praised be
 The rights that triumph over thee and me

 SEV
 Forgive Pauline forgive ah grief hath made me blind
 To all but griefs excess and fortune most unkind
 Forgive that I mistooknay treated as a crime
 Thy constancy of soul unequalled and sublime
 In pity for my life forlorn my peace denied
 Ah show thyself less fairone least perfection hide
 Let some alloy be seen some saving weakness left
 Take pity on a heart of thee and Heaven bereft
 One faintest flaw reveal to give my soul relief
 Else how to bear the love that only mates with grief

 PAUL
 Alas the rents in armour donned and proved
 Too well my fight proclaim yes I have loved
 The traitor sigh the tear unbid attest
 The combat fiercethe warrior sore distrest
 Say who can stanch these wounds that armour mend
 Thou who hast pierced thou thou alone defend
 Ah if thou honourest my victory
 Depart that thou mayst still defender be
 So dry the tears that to my shame still flow
 So quench the fire would work my overthrow
 Yes go my only friend with me combine
 To end my torture for thy pain is mine

 SEV
 This last poor drop of comfort may not be

 PAUL
 The cup is poisoned both for me and thee

 SEV
 The flower is goneI cherish but the root

 PAUL
 Untimely blossom bears a fated fruit

 SEV
 My grief be mine Let memory remain

 PAUL
 That grief might hope beget so leave a stain

 SEV
 Not mine to stain what Heaven hath made so pure
 For me one offering left tis this Endure
 Thy glory shall be mine my load I bear
 So spotless thou thy peerless crown shalt wear
 Farewell my love farewell I go to prove my faith
 To bless to save thy life so will I mate with death
 If prostrate from the blow there yet remains of life
 Enough to summon death and end the piteous strife

 PAUL
 My grief too deep for voice shall silent be
 There in my chamber will I pray for thee
 When thou art gone great Heaven shall hear my cry
 Griefs fruit for thee be hopedeathimmortality

 SEV
 Now with my loss alone let Fate contented be
 May Heaven shower bliss and peace on Polyeucte and thee

 PAUL
 Stern Fate obeyed end Death his agony
 And Jove receive my heroto the sky

 SEV
 _Thou wast_ my heaven

 PAUL
 My father I obeyed

 SEV
 O victim pure obedient undismayed
 Paulinetoo fairtoo dearI can no more

 PAUL
 So must I saydepartwhere I adore

 Exit Severus

 STRAT
 Yes it is hardmost sadbehold my tears
 But now at least there is no cause for fears
 Thy dream is but a dreamis naught is vain
 Severus pardons Gone that cause for pain

 PAUL
 Oh if from pity start thy easy tear
 Add not that other woeforgotten fear
 Ah let me breathe some respite give from trouble
 Those fears halfdead thou dost revive redouble

 STRAT
 What dost thou dread

 PAUL
 Heavenhellearthempty air
 All all is food for dread to my despair
 As thou unveilst begirt in lurid light
 The pallid ghost that slew me in the night

 STRAT
 Severus he by name yet noble in his heart

 PAUL
 Ah Polyeucte bathed in blood Depart depart

 STRAT
 For Polyeuctes welfare did Severus pray

 PAUL
 Yes yes his heart is great be that my stay
 Yet tho his truth his faith wellproved be
 Most baleful is his presence here to me
 Yea tho he would all ill for me undo
 Yet he hath power he loveshe came to woo

 Enter Polyeucte and Nearchus

 POLY
 The source of tears is dry oh weep no more
 Thy grief lay down thy fearful heart restore
 Let nights dark dream with superstition die
 The dream is past for here in life am I

 PAUL
 The day is young and oh the day is long
 And half the dream is true and Fate is strong
 Severus have I seen who thought him dead

 POLY
 I know it Let no tear for this be shed
 Secure with thee am I Tho great the knight
 Thy father will command to do me right
 The general is a man of honourhe
 Would neer that honour dim by treachery
 He comes in amity our friend our guest
 To greet his worth and valour now my quest

 PAUL
 Radiant he came who left me hopeless sad
 But he will come no morethis grace I had

 POLY
 What Thinkest thou that I can jealous be

 PAUL
 An outrage this on him on thee on me
 He came in peace who all my peace hath marred
 Who would run safely every step must guard
 The wife who danger courts but courts her fall
 My husband aid meI would tell thee all
 His worth his charm do my weak hearth enflame
 A traitor here And he is aye the same
 If I should gaze and longgainst virtue honour sense
 The citadel I yield and mine my own defence
 I know my virtues sure and fair my fame
 But struggle is defeatand combat shame

 POLY
 Oh true thy shield thy victory is won
 He only who has lost thee is undone
 His noble grief the cost of all my bliss
 Ah Cleopatras pearl was naught to this
 The more my faults I see the more thy truth I learn
 The more do I admire

 Enter Cleon

 CLEON
 My lord the altars burn
 With holy fire The victim they prepare
 On thee alone they wait our rites to share

 POLY
 Go we do follow thee

 PAUL
 I cannot go
 Severus flies my sight to him I owe
 My absencenot alas to him alone
 Go thou and oh remember he is great
 In his sole hands Severus holds thy fate

 POLY
 A foe so great so noble is a friend
 Oh not from him the lance that Heaven will send

 Exeunt Pauline Stratonice and Cleon

 NEAR
 Where gost thou

 POLY
 To the temple is the call

 NEAR
 What Wouldst thou mingle in their heathen brawl
 Thou art a Christian and canst thou forget

 POLY
 Canst _thou_ who fore mine eyes the cross didst set

 NEAR
 Not mine their gods

 POLY
 He calls me I must go

 NEAR
 I fly their altars

 POLY
 I would overthrow
 Not mine to fly a worship I disown
 By me Jehovah King of kings be known
 Not mine to tremble as I kiss the rod
 I conquer by the Cross I fight for God
 Thou wouldst abstain For me another course
 From Heaven the call and Heaven will give the force
 What Yield to evil His Cross on my brow
 His freemen we O fight Nearchus now
 For us our Lord was scourged pierced tortured slain
 For us He bled Say has He died in vain

 NEAR
 Let timely moderation temper zeal

 In time of need the faith must be confessed

 Seek thou the death thine own selfwill prepares

 POLY
 A crown I seek which every martyr shares

 NEAR
 A life of duty well that crown can win

 POLY
 The purest life on earth is stained with sin
 Why yield to time and chance what death assures
 Death but the gate of life that aye endures
 If I be Hislet me be His alone
 The faith that soars shall full fruition own
 Who trusts yet fears and doubts his faith is dead

 Not death the Christians prayer but daily bread

 Thou saidst If Him thou wilt for pattern take
 Then leave wife wealth home all for His dear sake

 Ah must the dawn of this my perfect day
 Find thy full light beclouded dimmed astray

 How can I storm the citadelthe traitor lurks within
 Forsake me not my God Thy spirit pour
 Oh make me true to Him whom I adore

 The old faith waneswe light her funeral pyre
 Her ashes fall before our holy fire
 Come trample under foot the gods that men have wrought
 The rotten helpless staff is broke is goneis naught
 Their darkness felt they own but let them see the light
 Their gods of stone of clay but vampires of the night
 Their dust shall turn to dustshall moulder with the sod

 I lived to doubt His wordI die to do His Will




ACT IIIPAULINE

 PAUL
 Caresclouded and confusedoppress obscure
 In changeful forms my eye my heart my mind
 My soul finds room for every guest save one
 Fair hope has flownno star can pierce my night
 Each tyrant rages gainst opposing foe
 In deadly fightyet brings to light no friend
 In travail sore hope comes not to the birth
 Fear hydraheaded terror still begets
 All fancies grim I see and straight embrace
 At hope I clutch who still eludes my grasp
 Her rainbow hues adored are but a frame
 That serve by contrast to make fear more dark
 Severus haunts meoh I know his love
 Yet hopeless love must mate with jealousy
 While Polyeucte who has won what he has lost
 Can meet no rival with an equal eye
 The fruit of rivalry is ever hate
 And envy both must still engender strife
 One sees that rival hand has grasped his prize
 The other yearns for prize himself has missed
 Weak reason naught when headlong passion reigns
 For valour seeks a sword and loverevenge
 One fears to see the prize he gained impaired
 The other would that wrested prize regain
 While patience duty conscience vail their heads
 Fore obstinate defence and fierce attack
 Such steeds no charioteer controlsfor they
 Mistake both curb and reign for maddening whip
 Ah what a base unworthy fear is mine
 How ill I read these fair these noble souls
 Whose virtue must all common snares oerleap
 Their gold unstained by dross or mean alloy
 As generous foes so will theymust they meet
 Yet are they rivalsthis the thought that kills
 Not even hereat homeis Polyeucte safe
 The eagle wings of Rome reach over all
 Oh if my father bow to Roman might
 If he repent the choice that he hath made
 At this one thought hopes flame leaps up to die
 Orif newborndies ere she see the light
 Hope but deceivedmy fear alone I trust
 Heaven grant such confidence be falsebe vain

 Enter Stratonice

 Nay let me know the worst What girlno word
 The rites are oer What hast thou seenwhat heard
 They met in amityIn peace they part

 STRAT
 Alas Alas

 PAUL
 Nay soothe my aching heart
 I would have comfortbut this face of woe
 A quarrel

 STRAT
 PolyeucteNearchusgo
 The Christians

 PAUL
 What of them

 STRAT
 Ah how to speak

 PAUL
 They on my father would their vengeance wreak

 STRAT
 Oh fear whateer thou wiltthat fear too small

 PAUL
 The Christians rise

 STRAT
 Oh would that this were all
 Thy dream Pauline is true Polyeucte is

 PAUL
 Dead

 STRAT
 Ah no he livesyet every hope is fled
 That courage once so high that noble name
 Sunk in the mire of everlasting shame
 He liveswho once was lovely in thy sight
 As monster foulhis every breath a blight
 The foe of Heaven of Jove of all our race
 His kisses poison and his lovedisgrace
 Wretch coward miscreant steeped in infamy
 O worse than every namea Christian he

 PAUL
 Nay that one words enough There needed not abuse

 STRAT
 My words fit well their guiltwith evil make no truce

 PAUL
 If _he_ be _Nazarene_he must an outcast be
 But insult to my lord is insult unto me

 STRAT
 Think only that he hails the Cross the badge of shame

 PAUL
 My plighted faith my troth my duty still the same

 STRAT
 When twined about thy breast the hideous serpent slay
 Who mocks the Gods on high will his own wife betray

 PAUL
 If he be false yet I will still be true
 The ties that bind me I will neer undo
 Let fateSeveruspassionall combine
 Against himI am his and he is mine
 Yes mine to guide lead win forgive and save
 I seek his honour tho he court the grave
 Let Polyeucte be Christs slaveFor woe for weal
 He is my lord the bond I owe I seal
 I fear my fatherall his vengeance dread

 STRAT
 Fierce burns his rage oer that devoted head
 Yet embers of old love still faintly glow
 And through his wrath some weak compassion show
 Gainst Polyeucte biting words alone he speaks
 But on Nearchus fullest vengeance wreaks

 PAUL
 Nearchus lured him on

 STRAT
 The tempter he
 Such friendship leads to death or infamy
 Oh cursed friend who in dear loves despite
 Has torn him from thine armshis neophyte
 He dragged him to the frontbaptized annealed
 He fights for ChristThe secret is revealed

 PAUL
 Which I would knowand straightway had thy blame

 STRAT
 Ah I foresaw not thistheir deed of shame

 PAUL
 Ere dull despair oermaster all my fears
 Oh let me gauge the worth of womans tears
 For if the daughter lose the wife may gain
 Or Felix may relent if Polyeucte mock my pain
 If both are adamant unto my prayer
 Thenthen alonetake counsel from despair
 How passed the temple sacrifice Hide naught my friend tell all

 STRAT
 The horror and the sacrilege must I perforce recall
 To say the words to think the thoughts seems blasphemy and shame
 Yet will I tell their infamytheir deed without a name
 To silence hushed the people knelt and turned them to the East
 Then impious Polyeucte and his friend mock sacrifice and priest
 They every holy name invoked jeer with unbridled tongue
 To laughter vile the incense rosetis thus our hymn was sung
 Both loud and deep the murmurs rang and Felix face grew pale
 Then Polyeucte mad defiance hurls while all the people quail
 Vain are your gods of wood and stone his voice was stern
 and high
 Vain every rite prayer sacrifice so ran his blasphemy
 Your Jupiter is parricide adulterer demon knave
 He cannot listen to your cry not his to bless or save
 One GodJehovahrules alone supreme oer earth and heaven
 And ye are Hisyes only Histo Him your prayers be given
 He is our source our life our endno other god adore
 To Him alone all prayer is due then serve Him evermore
 Who kneels before a meaner shrine by devils power enticed
 Denies his Maker and his King denies the Saviour Christ
 He is our source our guide our end our prophet priest and
 king
 Twas He that nerved Severus armHis praise let Decius sing
 Jehovah rules the battlefield ye call the field of Mars
 He only grants a glorious peace tis He guides all our wars
 He casts the mighty from his seat He doth the proud abase
 They only peace and blessing know who love and seek His face
 His sword alone is strong to strike His shield our only guard
 He will His bleeding saints avenge He is their sure reward
 In vain to Jove and feeble Mars your full libations pour
 Oh kneel before the might ye spurn the God ye mockadore
 Then Polyeucte the shrine oerthrows the holy vessels breaks
 Nor wrath of Jove nor Felix ire his fatal purpose shakes
 Foredoomed by Fate the Furies preythey rush they rend
 they tear
 The vessels all to fragments flyall prone the offerings fair
 And on the front of awful Jove they set their impious feet
 And order fair to chaos turn and thus their work complete
 Our hallowed mysteries disturbed our temple dear profaned
 Mad flight and tumult dire let loose proclaim a God disdained
 Thus pallid fear broods over all presaging wrath to come
 While Felixbut I mark his steptis he shall speak the doom

 PAUL
 How threatening how dark his mien How lightningfraught his eye
 Where wrath and grief revenge and pain do strive for mastery

 Enter Felix

 FELIX
 O insolence undreamedBefore my very eyes
 Before the peoples gaze It is too muchhe dies

 PAUL
 O fatheron my knees
 Kneels
 Unsay that word

 FELIX
 Nearchus doom I speaknot his thy lord
 Though all unworthy he to be my son
 Yet still he bears the name that he hath won
 Nor crime of his nor wrath of mine shall ever move
 Thy fathers heart to hate the man thou crownst with love

 PAUL
 Neer vainly have I sued for pity from my sire

 FELIX
 And yet meet food were he for righteous ire
 To recount an act so fell my feeble words too weak
 But thou has heard the tale my lips refuse to speak
 From her thy maiden she hath told thee all

 PAUL
 Nearchus goadedplannedand he shall fall

 FELIX
 So taught by torture of his vilest friend
 Shall Polyeucte mark of guilt the certain end
 When of the frenzied race he sees the goal
 The dread of torture shall subdue his soul
 Who mocked the thought of death when death he views
 Will choose an easier mateand rightly choose
 That shadowy guest that doth his soul entice
 Once master glues all ardour into ice
 And that proud heart which never meekness knew
 When face to face with Deathwill learn to sue

 PAUL
 What Thinkest thou his soul can ever blench

 FELIX
 Deaths mighty flood must every furnace quench

 PAUL
 It might It mayI know such things can be
 A Polyeucte changeddebasedforsworn I see
 O changeful Fortune changeless Polyeucte move
 And grant a boon denied by fathers love

 FELIX
 My love too plainmyself too weakly kind
 Let him repent and he shall pardon find
 Nearchus sin is hisand yet the grace
 He shall not win thy Polyeucte may embrace
 My dutyto a fathers love betrayed
 Hath of thy sire a fond accomplice made
 A healing balm I bring for all thy fears
 I look for thanks and lothou givst me tears

 PAUL
 I give no thanksno cause for thanks I find
 I know the Christian temperknow their mind
 They can blaspheme but ah they cannot lie
 They know not how to yieldbut they can die

 FELIX
 As bird in hand he holds his pardon still

 PAUL
 The bird escapes when tis the owners will

 FELIX
 He death escapesif so he do elect

 PAUL
 He death embracesas doth all his sect
 Ist thus a father pleads for his own son

 FELIX
 Who wills his death is by himself undone

 PAUL
 He cannot see

 FELIX
 Because he chooses night
 Who loves the darkness hateth still the light

 PAUL
 O by the Gods

 FELIX
 Nay daughter save thy breath
 Spurnedoutragedtis the Gods demand his death

 PAUL
 They hear our prayers

 FELIX
 Nay then let Polyeucte pray

 PAUL
 Since Decius gives thee powerthat word unsay

 FELIX
 He gives me power Pauline to do his will
 Against his foesgainst all who work him ill

 PAUL
 Is Polyeucte his foe

 FELIX
 All Christians rebels are

 PAUL
 Thy son shall plead more loud than policy or war
 For mine is thine O father save thine own

 FELIX
 The son who is a traitor I disown
 For treason is a crime without redress
 Gainst which all else sinks into nothingness

 PAUL
 Too great thy rigour

 FELIX
 Yet more great his guilt

 PAUL
 Too true my dream Must his dear blood be spilt
 With Polyeucte I toothy childshall fall

 FELIX
 The Godsthe Emperorrule over all

 PAUL
 O hear our dying supplicationhear

 FELIX
 Not Jove alone but Decius I fear
 But why anticipate a doom so sad
 Shall thishis blindnessmake thy Polyeucte mad
 Fresh Christian zeal remains not always new
 The sight of death compels a saner view

 PAUL
 O if thou lovst him still all hope forsake
 In one day can he two conversions make
 Not this the Christians mould they never change
 His heart is fixedpast power of man to estrange
 This is no poison quaffed all unawares
 What martyrs do and darethat Polyeucte dares
 He saw the lure by which he was enticed
 He thinks the universe well lost for Christ
 I know the breed I know their courage high
 They love the crossso for the cross they die
 We see two stakes of wood the felons shame
 They see a halo round one matchless Name
 To powers of earth and hell and torture blind
 In death for Him they love they rapture find
 They joy in agonyour gain their loss
 To die for Christ they count the world but dross
 Our rack their crown our pain their highest pleasure
 And in the worlds contempt they find their treasure
 Their cherished heritage ismartyrdom

 FELIX
 Let then this heir into his kingdom come No more

 PAUL
 O father

 Enter Albin

 FELIX
 Albin is it done

 ALBIN
 It isNearchus frantic race is run

 FELIX
 And with what eye saw Polyeucte the sight

 ALBIN
 With envious eyeas one who sees a light
 That lures him mothlike to devouring flame
 His heart is fixed his mind is still the same

 PAUL
 Tis as I saidoh father yet once more
 If thou hast ever loved meI implore
 Let filial duty and obedience plead
 For his dear life To my last prayer give heed

 FELIX
 Too much thou lovest an unworthy lord

 PAUL
 Thou gavest him my hand twas at thy word
 I gave both love and duty what I give
 I take not back oh Polyeucte must live
 For his dear sake I quenched another flame
 Most pure Is he my lord alone in name
 O by my blind and swift obedience paid
 To thy commandbe thy hard words unsaid
 I gave thee all a daughter had to give
 Grant father this one prayerLet Polyeucte live
 By thy stern power which now I only fear
 Make thou that power benignant honoured dear
 Thou gavst that gift unsoughtthat gift restore
 I claim it at the givers hand once more

 FELIX
 Importunate Although my heart is soft
 It is not waxand these entreaties oft
 Repeated waste thy breath and vex mine ear
 For man is deaf to what he will not hear
 _I am the master_ This let all men know
 And if thou force that note thoult find tis so
 Prepare to see thy cursed Christian fool
 Do thou caress when I have scourged the mule
 Go vex no more a loving fathers ear
 From Polyeuctes self win what thou holdst so dear

 PAUL
 In pity

 FELIX
 Leave me leave me here alone
 Say moremy goaded heart will turn to stone
 Vex me no moreI will not be denied
 Go save thy madman from his suicide

 Exit Pauline

 How met Nearchus death

 ALBIN
 The fiend abhorred
 He hailedembraced For Christ his latest word
 No sigh no tearhe passed without amaze
 Adown the narrow vale with upward gaze

 FELIX
 And hehis friend

 ALBIN
 Is as I said unmoved
 He looks on death but as a friend beloved
 He clasped the scaffold as a guide most sure
 And in his prison he can still endure

 FELIX
 Oh wretched that I am

 ALBIN
 All pity thee

 FELIX
 With reason greater than they know Ah me
 Thought surges upon thought and has its will
 Care gnawing upon care my soul must kill
 Lovehatefearpain I am of each the prey
 I grope for light but never find the day
 Oh what I suffer thou canst not conceive
 Each passion rages but can neer relieve
 For I have noble thoughts that die stillborn
 And I have thoughts so base my soul I scorn
 I love the foolish wretch who is my son
 I hate the folly which hath all undone
 I mourn his deathyet if I Polyeucte save
 I see of all my hopes the cruel grave
 Gainst Gods and Emperor too sore the strife
 For my renown I fearfear for my life
 I must myself undo to save my son
 For should I spare him then am I undone

 ALBIN
 Decius a father is and must excuse
 A fathers loveoh he will not refuse

 FELIX
 His edict is most clearAll Christians are my foes
 The higher be their rank the more the evil grows
 If birth and state be high their crime shows more notorious
 If he who shield be great his fall the more inglorious
 And if I give Nearchus to the flame
 Yet stoop to shield my ownthrice damned my name

 ALBIN
 If by thy fiat he cannot escape the grave
 Implore of Decius grace the life thou canst not save

 FELIX
 So would Severus work my ruin quite
 I fear his power his wrathfor might is right
 If crime with punishment I do not mate
 How high soeer worth what it may I fear his hate
 For he is man and feels as man and I
 Once spurned his suit with base indignity
 Yes he at Decius ear would work may woe
 He loves Pauline thus Polyeucte is his foe
 All weapons possible to love and war
 And those who let them rust but laggards are
 I fearand fear doth give our vision scope
 Een now he cherisheth a tender hope
 He sees his rival prostrate in the dust
 So as a man he hopesbecause he must
 Can dark despair to love and hope give place
 To save the guilty from deserved disgrace
 And were his worth so matchless so divine
 As to forbear all ill to me and mine
 Still I must own the base the coward hope
 Gainst which my strength is all too weak to cope
 That hope whose phoenix ashes yet enthrall
 The wretch who rises but once more to fall
 Ambition is my master iron Fate
 I feel obey adore thee while I hate
 Polyeucte was once my guard my pride my shield
 Yet can I by Severus weapons wield
 Should he my daughter wed more tried more true
 What wills Severusthat will Decius do
 Upheld by him een Fortune I defy
 And yet I shrinkfor them thrice base were I

 ALBIN
 Perish the word It neer was made for thee
 But wilt thou deal just meed to treachery

 FELIX
 I go to Polyeuctes cellthough my poor breath
 Should there be spent in vain to avert his death
 Then then my fated child her strength shall try

 ALBIN
 What wilt thou do if both he still defy

 FELIX
 O press me not in agony so great
 To thee alone I turnresistless Fate




ACT IVPOLYEUCTE CLEON THREE OTHER GUARDS

 POLY
 What is thy will

 CLEON
 Pauline would see my lord

 POLY
 Ah how my heart quails at that single word
 Thee Felix I oercame within my cell
 Laughed at thy threats if death and torture fell
 Yet hast thou still one arm to rouse my fears
 The rest I scorn but dread thy daughters tears
 One only talisman remains great God tis mine
 Sufficient for my every need His strength divine
 O thou dear saint thy scars all healed whiterobed in
 glory crowned
 Plead that I too may victory win thou who hast victory found
 Nearchus who hast clasped in Heaven that dear that pierced hand
 Plead that thy friend who wrestles here may safely by thee stand
 Ye Guards one last kind service I would ask
 Well may ye grant it tis an easy task
 I do not seek deliverance from these thralls
 Looks at his chains
 I do not care to scale my prison walls
 But since three warriors armed can surely guard
 One fettered man in safest watch and ward
 Go one and beg of great Severus grace
 That he would deign to meet me face to face
 To him would I a secret now impart
 Which much concerns his joy and peace of heart

 CLEON
 On willing foot my lord do I obey

 POLY
 Severus must this kindly service pay
 Ah lose no time time now has fleetest wings

 CLEON
 Full soon to thee thy prayer Severus brings

 Exit Cleon Guardsmen retire to background

 POLY
 The fount is pure yet bitter waters flow
 Sin taintsmen poison what was made all fair
 They will not choose immortal streams they go
 To seek for pleasurebut find only care
 Their pleasure wed to strifeah death the gate of life
 Christs servants none but they His crown shall wear
 So pain
 Is gain
 Count not the cost
 The world well lost
 His Heaven to share
 O Pleasure think not that I sigh for thee
 Thy charms that once enslaved no more delight
 In Christs dear name I bid the tempter flee
 His foes are mineunlovely in my sight
 The mighty from their seat He hurls beneath His feet
 His fan is in His hand His vengeful sword is bright
 Their crown
 Cast down
 All hopes most dear
 They cherish here
 Shall end in night
 O Decius Tiger Pitiless Athirst
 With quenchless rage for blood of Christs redeemed
 Armenia shall arise by thee accursed
 On her at last has Light of Asia beamed
 And our Deliverer from the holy east
 Shall dash the cup from thy Belshazzar feast
 Secure
 And pure
 Christs saints shall reign
 And purged by pain
 For aye endure
 Let Felix sacrifice me to thine ire
 Yea let my rival captivate the soul
 Of her who now with Decius doth conspire
 To chain immortal hope to earthly goal
 Let earthbound men pursue the worlds desire
 Sense charms not him who doth to Heaven aspire
 Hail pain
 Disdain
 All Earthly love
 To seek above
 A holier fire
 Oh Love that passeth knowledge be my stay
 And fire my heart to beat alone for thee
 Sun of my souloh flash one purest ray
 In that last hour supremeto comfort me
 So lifes brief night shall merge in endless day
 Come Death
 Last breath
 Shall praise thy name
 The same the same
 For aye For aye
 O heavenly fire most pure embracing all
 Come shield me from Pauline else must I fall
 I see her but no more as once I saw
 I am encased in armour without flaw
 To eyes that gaze alone on heavenly light
 Naught else is pure or dear or fair or bright

 Enter Pauline

 With what intent Pauline hast thou come here
 Have I a friend to aid or foe to fear
 Is it Christs soldier that thou comst to greet
 Or wouldst thou sink my triumph in defeat
 If thou wouldst bid me spurn the debt I owe
 Not Decius but Pauline my deadliest foe

 PAUL
 All save thyself to thee my love are friends
 Love but thyself love methy torment ends
 Alone thou sealst thy doom alone wouldst shed
 That blood by all Armenia honoured
 Yes thou art saved if thou for mercy plead
 Demand thy death and thou are lost indeed
 Think of the worth of this selfhated life
 And think in pity of Paulinethy wife
 Think of the people that their prince adores
 Think of the honours Felix on thee pours
 Oh I am nothing nothing unto thee
 But husband think how dear thou art to me
 Think how the path of glory on thee opes
 Thou dearest lodestar of a nations hopes
 Shall blood of kings be but the headsmans sport
 Is life a toy wherewith thy death to court

 POLY
 I think of more than this I know what thou wouldst say
 Our life is ours to use and we that debt must pay
 What life is this men love An idle empty dream
 Where nothing can endurewhere all things only seem
 Death ends their every joy which fickle Fortune leaves
 They gain a royal throne to learn how pomp deceives
 They gather wealth that men may envy their estate
 They clear a path by blood so envy turns to hate
 Such vast ambition mine as Caesar never knew
 Death bounds it not for death is but its servant true
 Peace that the world neer gave and cannot take away
 That peace Pauline is mine mine wholly mine for aye
 Nor time nor fate nor chance nor cruel war
 Can touch this peace or this my kingdom mar
 Is this poor lifethe creature of a day
 For endless peace too great a price to pay

 PAUL
 Out on these Christian dreams my reason cries
 Wheneer they speak of truth they utter lies
 Thou sayst To win such prize my life is naught
 But is thy life thine own How was it bought
 Our life an heirloom to our country due
 What gave thee birth demands thy service too
 Pay then thy debt to her who has the right

 POLY
 Ah for my country I would gladly fight
 I know the glory of a heros name
 I feel the thrillI recognise the claim
 My life I owe to whom I owe my sword
 But most to Him who gave itto the Lord
 Oh if to die for fatherland be sweet
 To die for Himmy Godwhat word is meet

 PAUL
 Which God

 POLY
 Hush hush Pauline the God who hears
 And answers prayersgives hopes assuages fears
 Thy gods are deaf and senseless maimed and weak
 Tongues mouths they have and yet they cannot speak
 The Christians God alone is mineis thine
 Jehovah only rulessupremedivine

 PAUL
 Adore Him in thy heart but say no word

 POLY
 What Can I call Jove and JehovahLord

 PAUL
 One moment feign Ah let Severus go
 Let but my father all his kindness show

 POLY
 Another Father mine His love most dear
 Removes me from a world begirt with fear
 For lifes stern race too weak too frail am I
 So by kind death He gives me Victory
 Pure from the holy fontHis mercies never fail
 He brings His barque to port when it hath scarce set sail
 Couldst thou but understand how poor this earth
 Couldst thou but grasp how great this second birth
 And yet why speak of treasure rare concealed
 From one to whom light is yet unrevealed

 PAUL
 O cruel I can strangle pain no more
 Is this the fruit of all thy heavenly lore
 They say thy Christ His enemies did bless
 Thou addest insult to my deep distress
 How is my soul so darkwhich was so fair
 Thou calldst me lovelydearbeyond compare
 Of my bereavement have I said no word
 I stilled my grief that I might soothe my lord
 They say that love has wings and all they say is true
 For all thy love has flown yet can I neer undo
 The vows I made the troth I plighted binds me still
 Thou fain wouldst quit thy wife and thou shalt have thy will
 Oh but to leave my side with rapture ecstasy
 No jealous Christ can will why grudge me one poor sigh
 This joy this transport fierce endeavour to conceal
 I do not share thy creed but I at least can feel
 Why gloat oer heavenly gain crowns palms I know not what
 Where Polyeucte is blest but where Pauline is not
 Soul body spirit I am thy true wife to own
 That I am but a bar to happiness unknown

 POLY
 Alas

 PAUL
 O that Alasso faint so tame
 Yet if repentant from thy heart it came
 Twould waken hope still brief and banish fears
 I wait the birth of thy reluctant tears

 POLY
 These tears I shed O might the Spirit pour
 Through them the light the light that I adore
 Then were my only grief all swept away
 For thou wouldst join me in the realms of day
 Else Heaven itself would have its bitterness
 Should I look down to witness thy distress
 O God who lovst the dust on which Thy breath
 Hath stamped Thine image truesave her from death
 The only death that kills and let my love
 From Heaven woo her to the realms above
 Lord hear my call My inmost heart now see
 Who lives a Christian life must Christian be
 Her nature godlike stamped from print divine
 She must be sealed Thine own yes only Thine
 Say must she burn condemned to depths of hell
 Thy Will be doneWho doest all things well

 PAUL
 O wretch what words are these Thou dost desire

 POLY
 To snatch thee from a neverending fire

 PAUL
 Or else

 POLY
 O God I trust to Thy control
 Who when we think not canst illume the soul
 The whenthe howis Hishere am I dumb
 I waitI waitThat blessed hour will come

 PAUL
 Oh leave illusions Love me

 POLY
 Thee I love
 Far more than self but less than God above

 PAUL
 For loves dear sake ah listen to my prayer

 POLY
 For loves dear sakeawait the answer _there_

 PAUL
 To leave me here is naught Thou wouldst seduce my soul

 POLY
 Heaven is scarce Heaven for me if thou reach not the goal

 PAUL
 O fancyfooled

 POLY
 Nay led by heavenly light

 PAUL
 Thy faith is blindness

 POLY
 Faith is more than sight

 PAUL
 Ah death strange rival to a wifes pure love

 POLY
 This world our rival with the joys above

 PAUL
 Go monster woo thy death Thou lovdst me never

 POLY
 Go seek the world and yet I love thee ever

 PAUL
 Yes I will goif absence bring relief

 Enter Severus Fabian and Guards

 Who comes to invade ah not to cure my grief
 Severus Who could guess that thou wouldst show
 Revenge unworthy oer a prostrate foe

 POLY
 Unworthy thee the thought Pauline for I
 Severus called and he hath heard my cry
 My importunity he will excuse
 My prayer I know that he will not refuse
 Severusthisthe treasure that was mine
 To thy most tender care I now resign
 To thee as noblest man that I have known
 Since earthly ties and joys I must disown
 The gift is worthy theeI know thy worth
 Is great but she no equal hath on earth
 My life the barmy death the link shall be
 Oh grudge me not my dear brief ecstasy
 Oh ease the heart that once was hersand guide
 Her doubting footsteps to the Crucified
 This my last benison All else is poor
 Await the promised light Believe Endure
 But words are vain

 Polyeucte signs to Guards to conduct him back to prison Exeunt
 Polyeucte and Guards

 SEV
 Most vain No word have I
 Such blindness must amaze must stupefy
 Nay this is frenzy I cannot conceive
 A mind so strange Mine ears cannot believe
 That one who loved theeyet who would not love
 A face that must the great immortals move
 Blessed by thy heartThy sweetest lips to taste
 Then leave refuse spurnyield with clamorous haste
 To yield a girl so dearso pureso fair
 And of that gift to make thy rival heir
 This beggars madness Or the Christian bliss
 Beyond mans soul to grasp To spurn thy kiss
 We treasure barter for a just exchange
 But to buy pain for thee Pauline tis strange
 Not thus ye Gods Severus had been blind
 To perfect blisshad Fortune been more kind
 The only heaven for me is in thine eyes
 These are my kings these my divinities
 To mefor theewere death with torture dear
 But to renounce thee

 PAUL
 Nay I must not hear
 Thy words bring back the dear the bygone days
 When I a maid might listen to thy praise
 Severus thou must know my inmost heart
 I hear the knell bids Polyeucte depart
 He diesthe victim of thine Emperors laws
 And thou though innocent art yet the cause
 Oh if thy soul to thy desires a slave
 See hope emerging from my husbands grave
 Then will I wed with paindespair embrace
 But wed Severus Never Twere disgrace
 To light fresh torch from that pale flickering fire
 Oh bliss too monstrous Thrice abhorred desire
 Back hope Back happiness The mate for me
 When Polyeucte leaves my sideis Constancy
 Were this my will were this ye Gods my fate
 To shame would memory turn as love must yield to hate
 But generous art thoumost generous be
 His pardon will my father grant to thee
 He fears thee more if Polyeuctes life he take
 For thee he slays himyes tis for thy sake
 Christ died for manlet pagan virtue dim
 His fame plead for thy foe so rival him
 No easy boon I ask there needs a soul most rare
 But when the fight is fiercethen is the victory fair
 To help a man to be what thou wouldst be
 Is triumph that belongs alone to thee
 Let this suffice thee she whom thou hast loved
 She who by thy great love was not unmoved
 Of thee and of no other dares to crave
 That thou Severus shouldst my husband save
 Farewell of this thy labour gauge the scope
 If thou art less than I yet dare to hope
 Then tell me not all else Pauline can bear

 Exit Pauline

 SEV
 Where am I Fabian Has the crack of doom
 Turned heaven to hell made life a living tomb
 Nearer and dearer everbut to go
 The prize within my grasp must I oerthrow
 ThisFortunes brimming cup with poison filled
 She bids me drainso newborn hope is killed
 Before I proffer aught I am refused
 Thus sad amazed ashamed in doubt abused
 I see the ghost I laid to life revive
 The more seductive still the more I strive
 Ah must a woman sunk in deep despair
 Teach me that shame is base and honour fair
 And while I madly shriek O love be kind
 Pauline deathstricken keeps an equal mind
 O generous but stern Must these dear eyes
 Because I love them oer love tyrannise
 Tis not enough to lose thee I must give
 My aidto make my faithless rival live
 Tis not enough his death I would not plan
 But I must save him bless where I would ban

 FABIAN
 Ah let the whole crew light one funeral pyre
 Yes let the daughter perish with her sire
 This cursd Armenian is one hornets nest
 Crush all then sail for Rome ah this were best
 She loves thee not What canst thou hope to gain

 SEV
 A glory that shall triumph over pain
 Tis hers and by the Gods it shall be mine
 Nor God nor fiend can sully such a shrine

 FABIAN
 Speak low for Jove has bolts and Hell has ears
 The dangers of this course arouse my fears
 What Decius implore a Nazarene to save
 Tis death that hath thy heart thou woost a grave
 His rage against the sect thou knowest well
 His power unbridledhis revenge is fell
 To plead for Christians is a task too great
 For man or God thou rushest on thy fate

 SEV
 Yes such advice I know is much approved
 Yet not thus can Severus soul be moved
 To Fate unequalequal to myself
 In dutys path I go For power and pelf
 I never swerve where honour leads the way
 Come weal come woe her call I must obey
 Let fate depress an all unequal scale
 Let Clothe hold her distaffIll not fail
 Yet one more wordthis to thy private ear
 The fables that thou dost of Christians hear
 Are fables only coined I know not why
 Distorted are they seen in Decius eye
 They practice the black artso all men say
 I sought to learn the laws that they obey
 And to discover what the secret guilt
 The which to expiate their blood is spilt
 Yet priests of Cybele dark rites pursue
 At Romeuntrammelledthis is nothing new
 To thousand gods men build unchecked their fanes
 The Christians God alone our state disdains
 Each foul Egyptian beast his temple rears
 Caligula a god to Roman ears
 Tiberius is enshrineda Nero deified
 To Christto Christ alonea temple is denied
 Such metamorphoses confuse the mind
 As gods in cats and saints in fiends we find
 As Ruler absolute Jehovah stands
 Alone oer heaven and earth and hell commands
 While pagan gods each gainst the other strive
 And neer one queen is found oer all the hive
 Nowstrike me dead Joves tarrying thunderbolt
 So many masters must provoke revolt
 And ah where Christians livethere life is pure
 Vice dies untended virtues all endure
 We give these men to rack and cord and flame
 While they forgive usin their Pardoners name
 They no sedition raise they neer rebel
 Rome makes them soldiers and they serve her well
 They rage in battle faithful ward they keep
 They fight like lions but they die like sheep
 They serve the State Romes servant must defend
 Those who to might of Rome such succour lend
 Pauline I will obey whateer befall
 The man who loseth honour loseth all




ACT VFELIX ALBIN CLEON

 FELIX
 Caught in Severus net thy Felix see
 He hates and holds meoh the misery

 ALBIN
 I see a generous man who cries Forgive
 Let Pauline smile once morelet Polyeucte live

 FELIX
 His soul thou canst not readtho noble heart he feigns
 The father he abhorsthe daughter he disdains
 What Polyeucte won he sought his suit denied
 Severus sues no moreI know his pride
 His words his prayers his threats for Polyeucte plead
 His _tongue_ says Listen or be lost indeed
 Unskilled the fowler who his snare reveals
 If at the bait I snatchmy doom is sealed
 Too plain too coarse this web for any fly
 Shall I this spider hail in my fatuity
 His wrath is wrath arranged his generous fire is nursed
 That I at Decius hand may meet the doom accurst
 If I should pardon grantthat grace my crime would be
 For he the spoil would reap of my credulity
 No simpleton am I each promise to believe
 Wordsoathsare but the tools wherewith all men deceive
 Too oft escaped am I to be so lightly caught
 I know that words are wind I know that wind is naught
 The trapper shall be trappedthe biter shall be bit
 Unravelled is the web that he poor fool hath knit

 ALBIN
 Jove What a plague to thee is this mistrust

 FELIX
 Nay those at court must fence their weapons never rust
 If once thou yield the clue to thread the maze
 The sequence is most plainthe man betrayed betrays
 Severus and his gifts alike I fear
 If Polyeucte still to reason close his ear
 Severus love is hatehis peace is strife
 First law of nature this Preserve thy life

 ALBIN
 Ah let Pauline at least thy grace obtain

 FELIX
 If Decius grace withhold my pardon vain
 Andfar from saving this rebellious son
 Behold us all alike entrapped undone

 ALBIN
 Severus promise

 FELIX
 He can never keep
 For Decius rage and hatred never sleep
 If for that sect abhorred Severus plead
 He trebles lossso are we lost indeed
 One only way is oursthat way I try
 To Guards
 Bring Polyeucte and if he still defy
 Selfdoomed insensate this my proffered grace
 He shall the death he wooes forthwith embrace

 ALBIN
 Ah this is stern

 FELIX
 Tis stern tis justas fate
 When justice drags a halting foot too late
 She is not justicefor the vengeful mob
 Whose hearts for Polyeucte neer cease to throb
 Usurps her place and spurning curb and rein
 The felon crowns and all our work is vain
 My sceptre trembles and all insecure
 Totters my crowna prey for every boor
 Then swift Severus hears the welcome news
 The jaundiced mind of Decius to abuse
 Shall I the rabbles lord obey the rabbles will

 ALBIN
 Who ill in all around foreseesbut doubles ill
 Each prop thou hast is but a sword to pierce
 If Polyeucte hold their heart the people fierce
 Will gather fiercer courage from despair

 FELIX
 Death settles all theyll find no helper there
 And ifwithout a headthe body should rebel
 Convulsive throes I mock and nerveless fury quell
 Whateer ensues the Emperor must approve
 I shall have done my part and win his love
 Here comes the man

 Enter Polyeucte and Soldiers

 I still must try to save
 If he repenttis well If notthe grave
 To Polyeucte
 Is life still hateful Doth death still allure
 Is earth still naught Do heavenly joys endure
 Doth Christ still counsel thee to hate thy wife
 To sheathe thy swordto cast away thy life

 POLY
 I never hated life or wooed a grave
 To life I am a servantnot a slave
 Here service free I give upon this earth below
 For higher service changed when to His Home I go
 Eternal life is this to tread the path He trod
 To Him your body yield Then trust your soul to God

 FELIX
 Yes trust to an abyss of depth unknown

 POLY
 No trust to Holy Cross That Cross my own

 FELIX
 The steep ascent my son I too would climb
 Yes I would Christian bebutgive me time
 By Jove Ill tread thy path This my desire
 Else at thy hand the judge may me require

 POLY
 Nay laugh not Felix He thy Judge will be
 No refuge there for impious blasphemy
 Nor kings nor clowns can scape His righteous ire
 His slaughtered Saints of thee will He require

 FELIX
 Ill slay no moreby Hercules I swear
 So I a Christian crown perchance may wear
 I will protect the flock

 POLY
 Nay rather be
 A goad a scourge for their felicity
 Let suffering purify each Christian soul
 Cross rack and flame but lead them to their goal
 What here they losein Heaven an hundredfold they find
 Be cruelpersecuteand so alone be kind
 My words thou canst not read thine eyes are blinded here
 Wait the unveiling _There_ Then understand and fear

 FELIX
 Nay nay in truth I would a Christian be

 POLY
 In thy hard heart alone a bar I see

 FELIX whispering
 This Roman knight

 POLY aloud
 Severus thou wouldst say

 FELIX
 Once let him sail I will no more delay
 For this I anger feignlet him depart

 POLY
 Tis thus thou wouldst reveal a Christian heart
 To idols dumbto Pagans blind thy sugared poison bear
 Christs servants quaff another cup sure refuge from despair

 FELIX
 What is this deadly draught that thou wouldst drain
 Ill drink thy wineTill then from death refrain

 POLY
 To swine no more my holy pearls I cast
 Faith_faith_not reason shall see light at last
 Soonwhen I see my Godyes face to face
 I will implore that Felix may find grace

 FELIX
 O dearest son thy loss were death to me

 POLY
 This loss can be repairedthe remedy
 Find in Severus he will take my place
 By Decius honoured he will not disgrace
 Thy house my death will an advantage win
 For thee for her for meThe work begin

 FELIX
 Such my reward Yes insult is the child
 Of injury The grace I grant reviled
 Shall turn to swift revenge The gods defied
 May do their will and speed the suicide

 POLY
 I thought the gods were dead but they revive
 With human passion Felix do not strive
 Against thy nature lay aside thy ruth
 Who loves a lie can never follow truth

 FELIX
 I humoured madness but the mood is oer
 I am myself again I did implore
 Twas vain the dark abyss that yawns for thee
 May hold thee now tomb to thy constancy
 The hope I cherishedfondlednow is flown
 Severus will be king and I oerthrown
 Shall I the gods by incense pacify
 Or by thy death for thou at last must die

 POLY
 Incense might but incense I cannot tell

 Enter Pauline

 Pauline

 PAUL
 That word broke from thee like a knell
 Who seeks my doom today Thouor my sire
 Who fires the brand Who lights the funeral pyre
 My father should by nature be my friend
 And lovers heart to love an ear should lend
 Who here is mine ally and who my foe
 Who has a heart to feelthis would I know

 FELIX
 Nay to thy lord appeal

 Pauline turns to Polyeucte

 POLY
 Severus wed

 PAUL
 Ah this is outrage Rather strike me dead

 POLY
 Oh dearer than myself to me thy weal
 My love would never wound it seeks to heal
 I see thee wrestle with thy deep distress
 Aloneunless Severus bring redress
 His merit that once gained thy maiden heart
 Hath still that worth when I from thee must part
 Once lovedand loving stillhis honour grows

 PAUL
 Thy wifes true heart another treatment owes
 O base reproach For this I crushed for thee
 My former love that I disdained might be
 This my reward for dearest victory won
 I did that love undoto be myself undone
 Resolve faith abnegation all were vain
 For thy return is outrage heaped on pain
 Oh sunk in tomb of shame most vile most mean
 Come back to lifeto honourto Pauline
 Holds out her arms
 To learn from her that loyalty and faith
 Religion areand all beside but death
 Once more Alcestis wrestles with the tomb
 Arise arise from thy enthralling doom
 And if my invocation feeble be
 Regard the tearsthe sighsshedbreathed for thee
 Love is too weak a wordI thee adore

 POLY
 Once have I saidyet now I say once more
 Live with Severus orwith Polyeucte die
 Thy tears are mine and thy pure constancy
 I share ButI am soldier of the Cross
 Take up thine own and count all gain but loss
 Paulineno more
 To FELIX
 Thy slumbering wrath rewake
 Thy fates and furies wait Their vengeance slake

 PAUL
 His life is saved These fetters all undo
 For justice never yet a madman slew
 And he is madbut father thou art sane
 And thou his father must his friend remain
 A father cannot less than father be
 Oh be to him what thou hast been to me
 But cast upon thy child a kinder eye
 Slay himThen know that I am doomed to die
 But even if justly done to death were he
 The sentence wrong that with him slayeth me
 For double death would double wrong present
 And slay the guilty with the innocent
 Twas thou didst link us closely hand in hand
 To live in bliss together thy command
 Oh shall the will that both our lives did bless
 Doom both these lives to deathto nothingness
 When lips are sealed to lips and heart to heart
 Tis tyranny not law such love to part
 Oh not a tyrant but a father be
 Forgivegive backrestore my love to me

 FELIX
 Dear child thy father is thy father still
 Nothing hath parted us and nothing will
 My heart is tender and it beats for thee
 Against this madman let us joined be
 O wretched man hast thou no eyes to see no heart to feel
 Thy guilt thy crime I would efface thy pardon I would seal
 _For_ thee my daughter cannot diesay must she die _with_ thee
 A victim to the only sin which neer can pardoned be
 O sight most strange Here at thy knees as suppliant I sue
 Felix kneels
 The evil that thyself hast wroughtthat ill thyself undo

 POLY
 Arise old man from knees unused to bend
 Or to another ear petition send
 This artifice befits nor me nor thee
 To beg of one twice threatenedMockery
 First by thy hand Nearchus felt the flame
 Then love forsooth thy pleaprofaned name
 The path of Christian neophyte hast thou trod
 And in Gods name hast mocked Almighty God
 Earth heaven and hell in turn have been thy tool
 And him thou hast traduced thou wouldst befool
 GobullyflattererliarEvery part
 Thou playest while delay doth break my heart
 Enough of dallying While thou dost dissolve
 Thy feeble soul in doubt hear my resolve
 The God who made meHim will I adore
 He holds my plighted faithand evermore
 He works salvation for his ransomed race
 Who gave His Son to death that we might life embrace
 And thisChrists sacrificecontinued day by day
 The Christ reveals and pleadsThe LifeThe TruthThe Way
 No more His mysteries to selfstopped ears
 Will I disclosehe heedeth not nor hears
 Pointing to Felix
 Pray then to these thy gods of wood and stone
 To gods who every deed of crime enthrone
 Who boast their malice and their foul incest
 Vaunt theft and murderall that we detest
 This their examplePaganfollow thou
 To Pluto bend to Aphrodite bow
 For this I broke their altars rased their shrine
 Yea for those crimes that thou dost call divine
 And what I did that would I do once more
 Before SeverusDeciusnay before
 The eyes of all menso would I proclaim
 One God alone adoredone Holiest Name

 FELIX
 At last my bounties yield to wrath most stern most just
 Die or the gods adore

 POLY
 A Christian I

 FELIX
 Thou must
 Adore the gods I say Adore or die

 POLY
 I am a Christian

 FELIX
 This is thy reply
 Ye Guards do my behestprepare the knife

 PAUL
 Where goes he

 FELIX
 To his death

 POLY
 Ah no to life
 To Pauline
 Remember me Farewell Pauline farewell

 PAUL
 Nay I will follow theeto heaven or hell

 FELIX
 Begone For all our ills this one redress

 Exeunt Pauline Polyeucte and Guards
 Enter Albin

 O task ungrateful to my gentle mind
 Well did he say Be cruel to be kind
 The people I defy ah let them rage
 Severus may in war of words engage
 Yes I have saved myselfI mean _the State_
 To wilful man there comes relentless fate
 My conscience pure of all reproachfor I
 Have lied and stormed to shake his constancy
 To give his hot young blood due time to cool
 I played the cowardnay I played the fool
 Why did he thus assail the gods and me
 With insult and with horrid blasphemy
 But interest helped me and resentment too
 Else had I found my duty hard to do

 ALBIN
 Soon mayst thou this thy dearbought victory rue
 For thou hast done what thou canst neer undo
 Unworthy deed for Roman knight ah me
 Aside
 I would that I could add unworthy _thee_

 FELIX
 Manlius and Brutus both a son have slain
 And neither did thereby his glory stain
 The part that is diseasedthat part we bleed
 So is the State from knaves and caitiffs freed

 ALBIN
 Revenge and pressing peril thee unman
 Elsecouldst thou bless a deed all men must ban
 When she thy widowed daughter comesthe air
 Of heaven will echo to her deep despair

 FELIX
 Thou dost remind me she with Polyeucte went
 I know not with what mind with what intent
 But her despair awakes my fond alarm
 Go Albin go and guard my child from harm
 She might the execution of the law
 Impede I would not that his death she saw
 Try to console herGo what dost thou fear

 Enter Pauline

 ALBIN
 I need not go for ahPauline is here

 PAUL
 Tyrant why leave thy butchery half done
 Come slay thy daughter thou hast slain thy son
 For hearHis villainyor worthis mine
 Why stay thy hand while I my neck incline
 Thy sword in me shall find a kindred food
 I too am new baptized baptized in blood
 These drops that fell from off the murderous knife
 Have made the martyrs widow a true wife
 I seeI feelI know My darkest night
 Is oerto break in purest heavenly light
 I too at last am Christs that word says all
 Those hands were pierced for meI hear His call
 Deathlovely deaththy beckoning hand I hail
 Oh help my passage or thy schemes may fail
 Dread Decius Fear Severus Fear thy fall
 Oh speed me to my lordmy lovemy all
 My husband calls me to his happier land
 Seethere Nearchus at his side doth stand
 Lead me to thesethe gods by thee confest
 Some shrines spared Polyeucte I will break the rest
 There there the gods thou fearest I will brave
 Oh bare thy knifeno other gift I crave
 _Thou_ hast my master been another Lord
 Claims my obedience now yes raise thy sword
 Revolt is holy when for Christ we fight
 My day has dawned the day that knows no night
 Once more I cryChrist only has my heart
 Thy bliss and mine secure Let me depart
 Keep thou thy kingdom Safe its treasure hold
 My kingdom therewith Christwithin the fold

 Enter Severus

 SEV
 Unnatural sire whose craft leads to the grave
 The slaves of fear themselves alone enslave
 Yes Polyeucte is slain and slain by thee
 A sacrifice to greed and treachery
 I offered rescue from the opening tomb
 Base doubts enthralled thee didst seal his doom
 I prayed I threatened thou wouldst not believe
 Deceiver thou so must all men deceive
 Thou thoughtst me coward liarthou shalt see
 All oaths Severus swears fulfilled shall be
 Poor moth I might have saved theenay I planned to save
 Thy perfidy the torch that marks thee for the grave
 Drench earth in bloodfor Jove pour forth malignant zeal
 The strokes that thou hast dealt redoubled shalt thou feel
 I go the storm shall break oer this devoted land
 From Jove the boltmaybebut I direct his hand

 FELIX
 Why lags that hand A willing victim I
 I choose to suffer for my perfidy
 My doubts my fears unworthy all I own
 I have offendedlet my death atone
 Take thou my honours their poor lustre thine
 I kneel before another nobler shrine
 The Power that moved me groping through the night
 Of wrong and darkness wafts me to The Light
 I slew thee Polyeucte but thy pardoning hand
 Shall guide thy murderer to the better land
 He prays for me and by his sacrifice
 Newborn upon his ashes I arise
 To Pauline
 Raised by his death from out the grave of sin
 Thou treadst the path thy father shall begin
 By me his martyrcrown as all my bliss
 By him His Christ is mine and I am his
 O blessed Christian vengeance All my loss
 Is turned to gain by the redeeming Cross
 Now Pauline am I thine a Christian I
 That Death gives life by which alike we die
 To Severus
 Then slay us both Behold a willing prey

 PAUL
 To Felix
 Yes mine for ever now Hail glorious day
 That sees earths loss transformed to endless gain

 FELIX
 The gain the glory Christs By Him we reign

 SEV
 Now am I dumb some miracle is here
 Their courage and their faith must I revere
 We slay them yet like Cadmus seed newborn
 They sprout afresh and laugh our scythe to scorn
 We give them cord and flame they torture hail
 Friends fail them but themselves they never fail
 We mow them down fresh nurslings to unbare
 What moves the seed lies hid but _it is there_
 They bless the world though by the world accurst
 Their shield am Ilet Decius do his worst
 I yet may own their power though now my will
 That each to his own gods be faithful still
 Let each still search for truth and truth adore
 To Felix
 A Christian thou Then fear my wrath no more
 Thy sect I cherish this their awful cult
 Severus will protect but neer insult
 Keep thou thy power from Roman sword secure
 So long as loyalty with faith endure
 I swear it ay the Emperor shall learn
 The guiltless from the traitor to discern
 His persecution baseless as his fear

 FELIX
 Severusthou who hast the hearing ear
 Freeman of RomeGods Spirit grant thee grace
 To be Christs Freeman and behold His face
 To theseChrists martyrsearths last rites be given
 Earth guard their ashes as a trust for Heaven
 Earth hides their dust When envious time is oer
 That dust shall wake to life for evermore

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To

particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
