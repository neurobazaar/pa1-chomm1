LITTLE BRITAIN

By Washington Irving


 What I write is most true I have a whole booke of cases
 lying by me which if I should sette foorth some grave
 auntients within the hearing of Bow bell would be out of
 charity with meNASHE


In the centre of the great city of London lies a small neighborhood
consisting of a cluster of narrow streets and courts of very venerable
and debilitated houses which goes by the name of LITTLE BRITAIN Christ
Church School and St Bartholomews Hospital bound it on the west
Smithfield and Long Lane on the north Aldersgate Street like an arm
of the sea divides it from the eastern part of the city whilst the
yawning gulf of BullandMouth Street separates it from Butcher Lane
and the regions of Newgate Over this little territory thus bounded and
designated the great dome of St Pauls swelling above the intervening
houses of Paternoster Row Amen Corner and Ave Maria Lane looks down
with an air of motherly protection

This quarter derives its appellation from having been in ancient times
the residence of the Dukes of Brittany As London increased however
rank and fashion rolled off to the west and trade creeping on at their
heels took possession of their deserted abodes For some time Little
Britain became the great mart of learning and was peopled by the busy
and prolific race of booksellers these also gradually deserted it and
emigrating beyond the great strait of Newgate Street settled down
in Paternoster Row and St Pauls Churchyard where they continue to
increase and multiply even at the present day

But though thus falling into decline Little Britain still bears traces
of its former splendor There are several houses ready to tumble down
the fronts of which are magnificently enriched with old oaken carvings
of hideous faces unknown birds beasts and fishes and fruits and
flowers which it would perplex a naturalist to classify There are also
in Aldersgate Street certain remains of what were once spacious and
lordly family mansions but which have in latter days been subdivided
into several tenements Here may often be found the family of a petty
tradesman with its trumpery furniture burrowing among the relics of
antiquated finery in great rambling timestained apartments with
fretted ceilings gilded cornices and enormous marble fireplaces The
lanes and courts also contain many smaller houses not on so grand a
scale but like your small ancient gentry sturdily maintaining their
claims to equal antiquity These have their gable ends to the street
great bowwindows with diamond panes set in lead grotesque carvings
and low arched doorways

In this most venerable and sheltered little nest have I passed several
quiet years of existence comfortably lodged in the second floor of
one of the smallest but oldest edifices My sittingroom is an old
wainscoted chamber with small panels and set off with a miscellaneous
array of furniture I have a particular respect for three or four
highbacked clawfooted chairs covered with tarnished brocade which
bear the marks of having seen better days and have doubtless figured
in some of the old palaces of Little Britain They seem to me to
keep together and to look down with sovereign contempt upon their
leathernbottomed neighbors as I have seen decayed gentry carry a
high head among the plebeian society with which they were reduced
to associate The whole front of my sittingroom is taken up with a
bowwindow on the panes of which are recorded the names of previous
occupants for many generations mingled with scraps of very indifferent
gentlemanlike poetry written in characters which I can scarcely
decipher and which extol the charms of many a beauty of Little Britain
who has long long since bloomed faded and passed away As I am an
idle personage with no apparent occupation and pay my bill regularly
every week I am looked upon as the only independent gentleman of
the neighborhood and being curious to learn the internal state of a
community so apparently shut up within itself I have managed to work my
way into all the concerns and secrets of the place

Little Britain may truly be called the hearts core of the city the
stronghold of true John Bullism It is a fragment of London as it was in
its better days with its antiquated folks and fashions Here flourish
in great preservation many of the holiday games and customs of yore
The inhabitants most religiously eat pancakes on Shrove Tuesday
hotcrossbuns on Good Friday and roast goose at Michaelmas they send
loveletters on Valentines Day burn the pope on the fifth of November
and kiss all the girls under the mistletoe at Christmas Roast beef and
plum pudding are also held in superstitious veneration and port and
sherry maintain their grounds as the only true English wines all others
being considered vile outlandish beverages

Little Britain has its long catalogue of city wonders which its
inhabitants consider the wonders of the world such as the great bell
of St Pauls which sours all the beer when it tolls the figures that
strike the hours at St Dunstans clock the Monument the lions in the
Tower and the wooden giants in Guildhall They still believe in dreams
and fortunetelling and an old woman that lives in BullandMouth
Street makes a tolerable subsistence by detecting stolen goods
and promising the girls good husbands They are apt to be rendered
uncomfortable by comets and eclipses and if a dog howls dolefully at
night it is looked upon as a sure sign of a death in the place There
are even many ghost stories current particularly concerning the old
mansionhouses in several of which it is said strange sights are
sometimes seen Lords and ladies the former in full bottomed wigs
hanging sleeves and swords the latter in lappets stays hoops and
brocade have been seen walking up and down the great waste chambers
on moonlight nights and are supposed to be the shades of the ancient
proprietors in their courtdresses

Little Britain has likewise its sages and great men One of the most
important of the former is a tall dry old gentleman of the name
of Skryme who keeps a small apothecarys shop He has a cadaverous
countenance full of cavities and projections with a brown circle round
each eye like a pair of horned spectacles He is much thought of by the
old women who consider him a kind of conjurer because he has two of
three stuffed alligators hanging up in his shop and several snakes in
bottles He is a great reader of almanacs and newspapers and is much
given to pore over alarming accounts of plots conspiracies fires
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions which last phenomena he considers
as signs of the times He has always some dismal tale of the kind to
deal out to his customers with their doses and thus at the same time
puts both soul and body into an uproar He is a great believer in omens
and predictions and has the prophecies of Robert Nixon and Mother
Shipton by heart No man can make so much out of an eclipse or even
an unusually dark day and he shook the tail of the last comet over the
heads of his customers and disciples until they were nearly frightened
out of their wits He has lately got hold of a popular legend or
prophecy on which he has been unusually eloquent There has been a
saying current among the ancient sibyls who treasure up these things
that when the grasshopper on the top of the Exchange shook hands with
the dragon on the top of Bow Church Steeple fearful events would take
place This strange conjunction it seems has as strangely come to
pass The same architect has been engaged lately on the repairs of the
cupola of the Exchange and the steeple of Bow church and fearful to
relate the dragon and the grasshopper actually lie cheek by jole in
the yard of his workshop

Others as Mr Skryme is accustomed to say may go stargazing and
look for conjunctions in the heavens but here is a conjunction on the
earth near at home and under our own eyes which surpasses all
the signs and calculations of astrologers Since these portentous
weathercocks have thus laid their heads together wonderful events had
already occurred The good old king notwithstanding that he had lived
eightytwo years had all at once given up the ghost another king had
mounted the throne a royal duke had died suddenlyanother in France
had been murdered there had been radical meetings in all parts of the
kingdom the bloody scenes at Manchester the great plot of Cato Street
and above all the queen had returned to England All these sinister
events are recounted by Mr Skryme with a mysterious look and a dismal
shake of the head and being taken with his drugs and associated in the
minds of his auditors with stuffed seamonsters bottled serpents and
his own visage which is a titlepage of tribulation they have spread
great gloom through the minds of the people of Little Britain They
shake their heads whenever they go by Bow Church and observe that they
never expected any good to come of taking down that steeple which in
old times told nothing but glad tidings as the history of Whittington
and his Cat bears witness

The rival oracle of Little Britain is a substantial cheesemonger
who lives in a fragment of one of the old family mansions and is as
magnificently lodged as a roundbellied mite in the midst of one of his
own Cheshires Indeed he is a man of no little standing and importance
and his renown extends through Huggin Lane and Lad Lane and even unto
Aldermanbury His opinion is very much taken in affairs of state having
read the Sunday papers for the last half century together with the
Gentlemans Magazine Rapins History of England and the Naval
Chronicle His head is stored with invaluable maxims which have borne
the test of time and use for centuries It is his firm opinion that
it is a moral impossible so long as England is true to herself that
anything can shake her and he has much to say on the subject of the
national debt which somehow or other he proves to be a great national
bulwark and blessing He passed the greater part of his life in the
purlieus of Little Britain until of late years when having become
rich and grown into the dignity of a Sunday cane he begins to take his
pleasure and see the world He has therefore made several excursions to
Hampstead Highgate and other neighboring towns where he has
passed whole afternoons in looking back upon the metropolis through a
telescope and endeavoring to descry the steeple of St Bartholomews
Not a stagecoachman of BullandMouth Street but touches his hat as he
passes and he is considered quite a patron at the coachoffice of the
Goose and Gridiron St Pauls churchyard His family have been very
urgent for him to make an expedition to Margate but he has great doubts
of those new gimcracks the steamboats and indeed thinks himself too
advanced in life to undertake seavoyages

Little Britain has occasionally its factions and divisions and party
spirit ran very high at one time in consequence of two rival Burial
Societies being set up in the place One held its meeting at the Swan
and Horse Shoe and was patronized by the cheesemonger the other at the
Cock and Crown under the auspices of the apothecary it is needless to
say that the latter was the most flourishing I have passed an evening
or two at each and have acquired much valuable information as to
the best mode of being buried the comparative merits of churchyards
together with divers hints on the subject of patentiron coffins I have
heard the question discussed in all its bearings as to the legality
of prohibiting the latter on account of their durability The feuds
occasioned by these societies have happily died of late but they were
for a long time prevailing themes of controversy the people of Little
Britain being extremely solicitous of funereal honors and of lying
comfortably in their graves

Besides these two funeral societies there is a third of quite a
different cast which tends to throw the sunshine of goodhumor over
the whole neighborhood It meets once a week at a little oldfashioned
house kept by a jolly publican of the name of Wagstaff and bearing for
insignia a resplendent halfmoon with a most seductive bunch of grapes
The old edifice is covered with inscriptions to catch the eye of the
thirsty wayfarer such as Truman Hanbury and Cos Entire Wine
Rum and Brandy Vaults Old Tom Rum and Compounds etc This indeed
has been a temple of Bacchus and Momus from time immemorial It ha
always been in the family of the Wagstaffs so that its history is
tolerably preserved by the present landlord It was much frequented by
the gallants and cavalieros of the reign of Elizabeth and was looked
into now and then by the wits of Charles the Seconds day But what
Wagstaff principally prides himself upon is that Henry the Eighth in
one of his nocturnal rambles broke the head of one of his ancestors
with his famous walkingstaff This however is considered as a rather
dubious and vainglorious boast of the landlord

The club which now holds its weekly sessions here goes by the name of
The Roaring Lads of Little Britain They abound in old catches glees
and choice stories that are traditional in the place and not to be met
with in any other part of the metropolis There is a madcap undertaker
who is inimitable at a merry song but the life of the club and
indeed the prime wit of Little Britain is bully Wagstaff himself His
ancestors were all wags before him and he has inherited with the inn
a large stock of songs and jokes which go with it from generation to
generation as heirlooms He is a dapper little fellow with bandy legs
and pot belly a red face with a moist merry eye and a little shock
of gray hair behind At the opening of every club night he is called
in to sing his Confession of Faith which is the famous old drinking
trowl from Gammer Gurtons Needle He sings it to be sure with many
variations as he received it from his fathers lips for it has been a
standing favorite at the HalfMoon and Bunch of Grapes ever since it was
written nay he affirms that his predecessors have often had the honor
of singing it before the nobility and gentry at Christmas mummeries
when Little Britain was in all its glory

It would do ones heart good to hear on a club night the shouts of
merriment the snatches of song and now and then the choral bursts of
half a dozen discordant voices which issue from this jovial mansion At
such times the street is lined with listeners who enjoy a delight
equal to that of gazing into a confectioners window or snuffing up the
steams of a cookshop

There are two annual events which produce great stir and sensation in
Little Britain these are St Bartholomews Fair and the Lord Mayors
Day During the time of the fair which is held in the adjoining regions
of Smithfield there is nothing going on but gossiping and gadding
about The late quiet streets of Little Britain are overrun with an
irruption of strange figures and faces every tavern is a scene of rout
and revel The fiddle and the song are heard from the taproom morning
noon and night and at each window may be seen some group of boon
companions with halfshut eyes hats on one side pipe in mouth and
tankard in hand fondling and prosing and singing maudlin songs over
their liquor Even the sober decorum of private families which I must
say is rigidly kept up at other times among my neighbors is no proof
against this Saturnalia There is no such thing as keeping maidservants
within doors Their brains are absolutely set madding with Punch and
the Puppet Show the Flying Horses Signior Polito the FireEater the
celebrated Mr Paap and the Irish Giant The children too lavish all
their holiday money in toys and gilt gingerbread and fill the house
with the Lilliputian din of drums trumpets and penny whistles

But the Lord mayors Day is the great anniversary The Lord Mayor
is looked up to by the inhabitants of Little Britain as the greatest
potentate upon earth his gilt coach with six horses as the summit of
human splendor and his procession with all the Sheriffs and Aldermen
in his train as the grandest of earthly pageants How they exult in
the idea that the King himself dare not enter the city without first
knocking at the gate of Temple Bar and asking permission of the Lord
Mayor for if he did heaven and earth there is no knowing what might
be the consequence The man in armor who rides before the Lord mayor
and is the city champion has orders to cut down everybody that offends
against the dignity of the city and then there is the little man with a
velvet porringer on his head who sits at the window of the statecoach
and holds the city sword as long as a pikestaffOdds blood If he
once draws that sword Majesty itself is not safe

Under the protection of this mighty potentate therefore the good
people of Little Britain sleep in peace Temple Bar is an effectual
barrier against all interior foes and as to foreign invasion the Lord
Mayor has but to throw himself into the Tower call in the trainbands
and put the standing army of Beefeaters under arms and he may bid
defiance to the world

Thus wrapped up in its own concerns its own habits and its own
opinions Little Britain has long flourished as a sound heart to this
great fungous metropolis I have pleased myself with considering it as
a chosen spot where the principles of sturdy John Bullism were garnered
up like seed corn to renew the national character when it had run
to waste and degeneracy I have rejoiced also in the general spirit of
harmony that prevailed throughout it for though there might now
and then be a few clashes of opinion between the adherents of the
cheesemonger and the apothecary and an occasional feud between the
burial societies yet these were but transient clouds and soon passed
away The neighbors met with goodwill parted with a shake of the hand
and never abused each other except behind their backs

I could give rare descriptions of snug junketing parties at which I
have been present where we played at Allfours PopeJoan
Tomecometickleme and other choice old games and where we sometimes
had a good old English country dance to the tune of Sir Roger de
Coverley Once a year also the neighbors would gather together and
go on a gypsy party to Epping Forest It would have done any mans heart
good to see the merriment that took place here as we banqueted on
the grass under the trees How we made the woods ring with bursts of
laughter at the songs of little Wagstaff and the merry undertaker
After dinner too the young folks would play at blindmansbuff and
hideandseek and it was amusing to see them tangled among the briers
and to hear a fine romping girl now and then squeak from among the
bushes The elder folks would gather round the cheesemonger and the
apothecary to hear them talk politics for they generally brought out a
newspaper in their pockets to pass away time in the country They
would now and then to be sure get a little warm in argument but
their disputes were always adjusted by reference to a worthy old
umbrellamaker in a double chin who never exactly comprehending the
subject managed somehow or other to decide in favor of both parties

All empires however says some philosopher or historian are doomed to
changes and revolutions Luxury and innovation creep in factions arise
and families now and then spring up whose ambition and intrigues
throw the whole system into confusion Thus in latter days has the
tranquillity of Little Britain been grievously disturbed and its golden
simplicity of manners threatened with total subversion by the aspiring
family of a retired butcher

The family of the Lambs had long been among the most thriving and
popular in the neighborhood the Miss Lambs were the belles of Little
Britain and everybody was pleased when Old Lamb had made money enough
to shut up shop and put his name on a brass plate on his door In an
evil hour however one of the Miss Lambs had the honor of being a lady
in attendance on the Lady Mayoress at her grand annual ball on which
occasion she wore three towering ostrich feathers on her head The
family never got over it they were immediately smitten with a passion
for high life set up a onehorse carriage put a bit of gold lace round
the errand boys hat and have been the talk and detestation of the
whole neighborhood ever since They could no longer be induced to
play at PopeJoan or blindmansbuff they could endure no dances but
quadrilles which nobody had ever heard of in Little Britain and they
took to reading novels talking bad French and playing upon the piano
Their brother too who had been articled to an attorney set up for a
dandy and a critic characters hitherto unknown in these parts and
he confounded the worthy folks exceedingly by talking about Kean the
opera and the Edinburgh Review

What was still worse the Lambs gave a grand ball to which they
neglected to invite any of their old neighbors but they had a great
deal of genteel company from Theobalds Road RedLion Square and other
parts towards the west There were several beaux of their brothers
acquaintance from Grays Inn Lane and Hatton Garden and not less
than three Aldermens ladies with their daughters This was not to be
forgotten or forgiven All Little Britain was in an uproar with the
smacking of whips the lashing of miserable horses and the rattling and
the jingling of hackney coaches The gossips of the neighborhood might
be seen popping their nightcaps out at every window watching the crazy
vehicles rumble by and there was a knot of virulent old cronies that
kept a lookout from a house just opposite the retired butchers and
scanned and criticised every one that knocked at the door

This dance was a cause of almost open war and the whole neighborhood
declared they would have nothing more to say to the Lambs It is
true that Mrs Lamb when she had no engagements with her quality
acquaintance would give little humdrum teajunketings to some of her
old cronies quite as she would say in a friendly way and it is
equally true that her invitations were always accepted in spite of all
previous vows to the contrary Nay the good ladies would sit and be
delighted with the music of the Miss Lambs who would condescend to
strum an Irish melody for them on the piano and they would listen
with wonderful interest to Mrs Lambs anecdotes of Alderman Plunkets
family of Portsokenward and the Miss Timberlakes the rich heiresses
of CrutchedFriars but then they relieved their consciences and
averted the reproaches of their confederates by canvassing at the next
gossiping convocation everything that had passed and pulling the Lambs
and their rout all to pieces

The only one of the family that could not be made fashionable was the
retired butcher himself Honest Lamb in spite of the meekness of his
name was a rough hearty old fellow with the voice of a lion a head
of black hair like a shoebrush and a broad face mottled like his own
beef It was in vain that the daughters always spoke of him as the old
gentleman addressed him as papa in tones of infinite softness
and endeavored to coax him into a dressinggown and slippers and other
gentlemanly habits Do what they might there was no keeping down the
butcher His sturdy nature would break through all their glozings He
had a hearty vulgar goodhumor that was irrepressible His very jokes
made his sensitive daughters shudder and he persisted in wearing his
blue cotton coat of a morning dining at two oclock and having a bit
of sausage with his tea

He was doomed however to share the unpopularity of his family He
found his old comrades gradually growing cold and civil to him no
longer laughing at his jokes and now and then throwing out a fling at
some people and a hint about quality binding This both nettled
and perplexed the honest butcher and his wife and daughters with
the consummate policy of the shrewder sex taking advantage of the
circumstance at length prevailed upon him to give up his afternoons
pipe and tankard at Wagstaffs to sit after dinner by himself and
take his pint of porta liquor he detestedand to nod in his chair in
solitary and dismal gentility

The Miss Lambs might now be seen flaunting along the streets in French
bonnets with unknown beaux and talking and laughing so loud that it
distressed the nerves of every good lady within hearing They even
went so far as to attempt patronage and actually induced a French
dancingmaster to set up in the neighborhood but the worthy folks of
Little Britain took fire at it and did so persecute the poor Gaul that
he was fain to pack up fiddle and dancingpumps and decamp with such
precipitation that he absolutely forgot to pay for his lodgings

I had flattered myself at first with the idea that all this fiery
indignation on the part of the community was merely the overflowing of
their zeal for good old English manners and their horror of innovation
and I applauded the silent contempt they were so vociferous in
expressing for upstart pride French fashions and the Miss Lambs But
I grieve to say that I soon perceived the infection had taken hold
and that my neighbors after condemning were beginning to follow their
example I overheard my landlady importuning her husband to let their
daughters have one quarter at French and music and that they might take
a few lessons in quadrille I even saw in the course of a few Sundays
no less than five French bonnets precisely like those of the Miss
Lambs parading about Little Britain

I still had my hopes that all this folly would gradually die away that
the Lambs might move out of the neighborhood might die or might run
away with attorneys apprentices and that quiet and simplicity might be
again restored to the community But unluckily a rival power arose An
opulent oilman died and left a widow with a large jointure and a family
of buxom daughters The young ladies had long been repining in secret
at the parsimony of a prudent father which kept down all their elegant
aspirings Their ambition being now no longer restrained broke out
into a blaze and they openly took the field against the family of the
butcher It is true that the Lambs having had the first start had
naturally an advantage of them in the fashionable career They could
speak a little bad French play the piano dance quadrilles and had
formed high acquaintances but the Trotters were not to be distanced
When the Lambs appeared with two feathers in their hats the Miss
Trotters mounted four and of twice as fine colors If the Lambs gave
a dance the Trotters were sure not to be behindhand and though they
might not boast of as good company yet they had double the number and
were twice as merry

The whole community has at length divided itself into fashionable
factions under the banners of these two families The old games of
PopeJoan and Tomcometickleme are entirely discarded there is no
such thing as getting up an honest country dance and on my attempting
to kiss a young lady under the mistletoe last Christmas I was
indignantly repulsed the Miss Lambs having pronounced it shocking
vulgar Bitter rivalry has also broken out as to the most fashionable
part of Little Britain the Lambs standing up for the dignity of
the CrossKeys Square and the Trotters for the vicinity of St
Bartholomews

Thus is this little territory torn by factions and internal dissensions
like the great empire who name it bears and what will be the result
would puzzle the apothecary himself with all his talent at prognostics
to determine though I apprehend that it will terminate in the total
downfall of genuine John Bullism

The immediate effects are extremely unpleasant to me Being a single
man and as I observed before rather an idle goodfornothing
personage I have been considered the only gentleman by profession in
the place I stand therefore in high favor with both parties and have
to hear all their cabinet councils and mutual backbitings As I am too
civil not to agree with the ladies on all occasions I have committed
myself most horribly with both parties by abusing their opponents
I might manage to reconcile this to my conscience which is a truly
accommodating one but I cannot to my apprehensionif the Lambs and
Trotters ever come to a reconciliation and compare notes I am ruined

I have determined therefore to beat a retreat in time and am actually
looking out for some other nest in this great city where old English
manners are still kept up where French is neither eaten drunk danced
nor spoken and where there are no fashionable families of retired
tradesmen This found I will like a veteran rat hasten away before I
have an old house about my ears bid a long though a sorrowful adieu
to my present abode and leave the rival factions of the Lambs and the
Trotters to divide the distracted empire of LITTLE BRITAIN
