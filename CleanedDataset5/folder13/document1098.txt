CHAPTER I

There is a midland city in the heart of fair open country a dirty and
wonderful city nesting dingily in the fog of its own smoke The stranger
must feel the dirt before he feels the wonder for the dirt will be upon
him instantly It will be upon him and within him since he must breathe
it and he may care for no further proof that wealth is here better
loved than cleanliness but whether he cares or not the negligently
tended streets incessantly press home the point and so do the flecked
and grimy citizens At a breeze he must smother in the whirlpools of
dust and if he should decline at any time to inhale the smoke he has
the meager alternative of suicide

The smoke is like the bad breath of a giant panting for more and more
riches He gets them and pants the fiercer smelling and swelling
prodigiously He has a voice a hoarse voice hot and rapacious trained
to one tune Wealth I will get Wealth I will make Wealth I will sell
Wealth for more Wealth My house shall be dirty my garment shall be
dirty and I will foul my neighbor so that he cannot be cleanbut I
will get Wealth There shall be no clean thing about me my wife shall
be dirty and my child shall be dirty but I will get Wealth And yet it
is not wealth that he is so greedy for what the giant really wants is
hasty riches To get these he squanders wealth upon the four winds for
wealth is in the smoke

Not so long ago as a generation there was no panting giant here no
heaving grimy city there was but a pleasant big town of neighborly
people who had understanding of one another being on the whole much
of the same type It was a leisurely and kindly placehomelike it
was calledand when the visitor had been taken through the State Asylum
for the Insane and made to appreciate the view of the cemetery from a
little hill his hosts duty as Baedeker was done The good burghers
were given to jogging comfortably about in phaetons or in surreys for
a family drive on Sunday No one was very rich few were very poor the
air was clean and there was time to live

But there was a spirit abroad in the land and it was strong here as
elsewherea spirit that had moved in the depths of the American soil
and labored there sweating till it stirred the surface rove the
mountains and emerged tangible and monstrous the god of all good
American heartsBigness And that god wrought the panting giant

In the souls of the burghers there had always been the profound
longing for size Year by year the longing increased until it became
an accumulated force We must Grow We must be Big We must be Bigger
Bigness means Money And the thing began to happen their longing became
a mighty Will We must be Bigger Bigger Bigger Get people here Coax
them here Bribe them Swindle them into coming if you must but get
them Shout them into coming Deafen them into coming Any kind of
people all kinds of people We must be Bigger Blow Boost Brag
Kill the faultfinder Scream and bellow to the Most High Bigness is
patriotism and honor Bigness is love and life and happiness Bigness is
Money We want Bigness

They got it From all the states the people came thinly at first and
slowly but faster and faster in thicker and thicker swarms as the quick
years went by White people came and black people and brown people
and yellow people the negroes came from the South by the thousands and
thousands multiplying by other thousands and thousands faster than
they could die From the four quarters of the earth the people came
the broken and the unbroken the tame and the wildGermans Irish
Italians Hungarians Scotch Welsh English French Swiss Swedes
Norwegians Greeks Poles Russian Jews Dalmatians Armenians
Rumanians Servians Persians Syrians Japanese Chinese Turks and
every hybrid that these could propagate And if there were no Eskimos
nor Patagonians what other human strain that earth might furnish failed
to swim and bubble in this crucible

With Bigness came the new machinery and the rush the streets began to
roar and rattle the houses to tremble the pavements were worn under
the tread of hurrying multitudes The old leisurely quizzical look of
the faces was lost in something harder and warier and a cockney
type began to emerge discerniblya cynical young mongrel barbaric
of feature muscular and cunning dressed in good fabrics fashioned
apparently in imitation of the sketches drawn by newspaper comedians
The female of his kind came with hima pale girl shoddy and a little
rouged and they communicated in a nasal argot mainly insolences and
elisions Nay the common speech of the people showed change in
place of the old midland vernacular irregular but clean and not
unwholesomely drawling a jerky dialect of coined metaphors began to
be heard held together by GUNNAS and GOTTAS and much fostered by the
public journals

The city piled itself high in the center tower on tower for a nucleus
and spread itself out over the plain mile after mile and in its
vitals like benevolent bacilli contending with malevolent in the body
of a man missions and refuges offered what resistance they might to the
saloons and all the hells that cities house and shelter Temptation
and ruin were ready commodities on the market for purchase by the
venturesome highwaymen walked the streets at night and sometimes
killed snatching thieves were busy everywhere in the dusk while
housebreakers were a common apprehension and frequent reality Life
itself was somewhat safer from intentional destruction than it was in
medieval Rome during a faction warthough the Roman murderer was more
like to pay for his deedbut death or mutilation beneath the wheels lay
in ambush at every crossing

The politicians let the people make all the laws they liked it did
not matter much and the taxes went up which is good for politicians
Lawmaking was a pastime of the people nothing pleased them more
Singular fermentation of their humor they even had laws forbidding
dangerous speed More marvelous still they had a law forbidding smoke
They forbade chimneys to smoke and they forbade cigarettes to smoke
They made laws for all things and forgot them immediately though
sometimes they would remember after a while and hurry to make new laws
that the old laws should be enforcedand then forget both new and old
Wherever enforcement threatened Money or Votesor wherever it was too
much to botherit became a joke Influence was the law

So the place grew And it grew strong

Straightway when he came each man fell to the same worship

 Give me of thyself O Bigness
 Power to get more power
 Riches to get more riches
 Give me of thy sweat that I may sweat more
 Give me Bigness to get more Bigness to myself
 O Bigness for Thine is the Power and the Glory And
 there is no end but Bigness ever and for ever



CHAPTER II

The Sheridan Building was the biggest skyscraper the Sheridan Trust
Company was the biggest of its kind and Sheridan himself had been the
biggest builder and breaker and truster and buster under the smoke He
had come from a country crossroads at the beginning of the growth and
he had gone up and down in the booms and relapses of that period but
each time he went down he rebounded a little higher until finally
after a year of overwork and anxietythe latter not decreased by a
chance remote but possible of recuperation from the former in the
penitentiaryhe found himself on top with solid substance under
his feet and thereafter played it safe But his hunger to get was
unabated for it was in the very bones of him and grew fiercer

He was the city incarnate He loved it calling it Gods country as he
called the smoke Prosperity breathing the dingy cloud with relish And
when soot fell upon his cuff he chuckled he could have kissed it Its
good Its good he said and smacked his lips in gusto Good clean
soot its our lifeblood God bless it The smoke was one of his
great enthusiasms he laughed at a committee of plaintive housewives who
called to beg his aid against it Smokes what brings your husbands
money home on Saturday night he told them jovially Smoke may hurt
your little shrubberies in the front yard some but its the catarrhal
climate and the adenoids that starts your chuldern coughing Smoke makes
the climate better Smoke means good health it makes the people wash
more They have to wash so much they wash off the microbes You go
home and ask your husbands what smoke puts in their pockets out o the
payrolland youll come around next time to get me to turn out more
smoke instead o chokin it off

It was Narcissism in him to love the city so well he saw his reflection
in it and like it he was grimy big careless rich strong and
unquenchably optimistic From the deepest of his inside all the way out
he believed it was the finest city in the world Finest was his word
He thought of it as his city as he thought of his family as his family
and just as profoundly believed his city to be the finest city in
the world so did he believe his family to bein spite of his son
Bibbsthe finest family in the world As a matter of fact he knew
nothing worth knowing about either

Bibbs Sheridan was a musing sort of boy poor in health and considered
the failurethe odd oneof the family Born during that most
dangerous and anxious of the early years when the mother fretted and
the father took his chance he was an illnourished baby and
grew meagerly only lengthwise through a feeble childhood At his
christening he was committed for life to Bibbs mainly through lack of
imagination on his mothers part for though it was her maiden name she
had no strong affection for it but it was her turn to name the baby
and as she explained later she couldnt think of anything else she
liked AT ALL She offered this explanation one day when the sickly boy
was nine and after a long fit of brooding had demanded some reason for
his names being Bibbs He requested then with unwonted vehemence to
be allowed to exchange names with his older brother Roscoe Conkling
Sheridan or with the oldest James Sheridan Junior and upon being
refused went down into the cellar and remained there the rest of
that day And the cook descending toward dusk reported that he had
vanished but a search revealed that he was in the coalpile completely
covered and still burrowing Removed by force and carried upstairs
he maintained a cryptic demeanor refusing to utter a syllable of
explanation even under the lash This obvious thing was wholly a
mystery to both parents the mother was nonplussed failed to trace and
connect and the father regarded his son as a stubborn and mysterious
fool an impression not effaced as the years went by

At twentytwo Bibbs was physically no more than the outer scaffolding
of a man waiting for the building to begin insidea longshanked
longfaced rickety youth sallow and hollow and haggard darkhaired
and darkeyed with a peculiar expression of countenance indeed at
first sight of Bibbs Sheridan a stranger might well be solicitous for
he seemed upon the point of tears But to a slightly longer gaze not
grief but mirth was revealed as his emotion while a more searching
scrutiny was proportionately more puzzlinghe seemed about to burst out
crying or to burst out laughing one or the other inevitably but it
was impossible to decide which And Bibbs never on any occasion of his
life either laughed aloud or wept

He was a disappointment to his father At least that was the parents
worda confirmed and established word after his first attempt to make
a business man of the boy He sent Bibbs to begin at the bottom and
learn from the ground up in the machineshop of the Sheridan Automatic
Pump Works and at the end of six months the family physician sent Bibbs
to begin at the bottom and learn from the ground up in a sanitarium

You neednt worry mamma Sheridan told his wife Theres nothin the
matter with Bibbs except he hates work so much it makes him sick I put
him in the machineshop and I guess I know what Im doin about as well
as the next man Ole Doc Gurney always was one o them nutty alarmists
Does he think Id do anything d be bad for my own flesh and blood He
makes me tired

Anything except perfectly definite health or perfectly definite disease
was incomprehensible to Sheridan He had a genuine conviction that lack
of physical persistence in any task involving money must be due to some
subtle weakness of character itself to some profound shiftlessness or
slyness He understood typhoid fever pneumonia and appendicitisone
had them and either died or got over them and went back to workbut
when the word nervous appeared in a diagnosis he became honestly
suspicious he had the feeling that there was something contemptible
about it that there was a nigger in the woodpile somewhere

Look at me he said Look at what I did at his age Why when I was
twenty years old wasnt I up every morning at four oclock choppin
woodyes and out in the dark and the snowto build a fire in a
country grocery store And here Bibbs has to go and have a DOCTOR
because he cantPho it makes me tired If hed gone at it like a man
he wouldnt be sick

He paced the bedroomthe usual setting for such parental
discussionsin his nightgown shaking his big grizzled head and
gesticulating to his bedded spouse My Lord he said If a little
teeny bit o work like this is too much for him why he aint fit for
anything Its ninetenths imagination and the rest of itwell I
wont say its deliberate but I WOULD like to know just how much of
its put on

Bibbs didnt want the doctor said Mrs Sheridan It was when he was
here to dinner that night and noticed how he couldnt eat anything
Honey you better come to bed

Eat he snorted Eat Its work that makes men eat And its
imagination that keeps people from eatin Busy men dont get time for
that kind of imagination and theres another thing youll notice
about good health if youll take the trouble to look around you Mrs
Sheridan busy men havent got time to be sick and they dont GET sick
You just think it over and youll find that ninetynine per cent of the
sick people you know are either women or loafers Yes maam

Honey she said again drowsily you better come to bed

Look at the other boys her husband bade her Look at Jim and Roscoe
Look at how THEY work There isnt a shiftless bone in their bodies
Work never made Jim or Roscoe sick Jim takes half the load off my
shoulders already Right now there isnt a harderworkin brighter
business man in this city than Jim Ive pushed him but he give me
something to push AGAINST You cant push nervous dyspepsia And look
at Roscoe just LOOK at what that boys done for himself and barely
twentyseven years oldmarried got a fine wife and ready to build
for himself with his own money when I put up the New House for you and
Edie

Papa youll catch cold in your bare feet she murmured You better
come to bed

And Im just as proud of Edie for a girl he continued emphatically
as I am of Jim and Roscoe for boys Shell make some man a mighty good
wife when the time comes Shes the prettiest and talentedest girl in
the United States Look at that poem she wrote when she was in school
and took the prize with its the best poem I ever read in my life and
shed never even tried to write one before Its the finest thing I
ever read and R T Bloss said so too and I guess hes a good enough
literary judge for meturns out more advertisin litercher than any
man in the city I tell you shes smart Look at the way she worked me
to get me to promise the New Houseand I guess you had your finger
in that too mamma This old shacks good enough for me but you and
little Edie ll have to have your way Ill get behind her and push her
the same as I will Jim and Roscoe I tell you Im mighty proud o them
three chuldern But Bibbs He paused shaking his head Honest
mamma when I talk to men that got ALL their boys doin well and worth
their salt why I have to keep my mind on Jim and Roscoe and forget
about Bibbs

Mrs Sheridan tossed her head fretfully upon the pillow You did the
best you could papa she said impatiently so come to bed and quit
reproachin yourself for it

He glared at her indignantly Reproachin myself he snorted I aint
doin anything of the kind What in the name o goodness would I want
to reproach myself for And it wasnt the best I could either It was
the best ANYBODY could I was givin him a chance to show what was
in him and make a man of himselfand here he goes and gets nervous
dyspepsia on me

He went to the oldfashioned gasfixture turned out the light and
muttered his way morosely into bed

What said his wife crossly bothered by a subsequent mumbling

More like hookworm I said he explained speaking louder I dont
know what to do with him



CHAPTER III

Beginning at the beginning and learning from the ground up was a long
course for Bibbs at the sanitarium with milk and zwieback as the
basis of instruction and the months were many and tiresome before he
was considered near enough graduation to go for a walk leaning on a
nurse and a cane These and subsequent months saw the planning the
building and the completion of the New House and it was to that abode
of Bigness that Bibbs was brought when the cane without the nurse was
found sufficient to his support

Edith met him at the station Well well Bibbs she said as he came
slowly through the gates the last of all the travelers from that train
She gave his hand a brisk little shake averting her eyes after a quick
glance at him and turning at once toward the passage to the street Do
you think they ought tove let you come You certainly dont look well

But I certainly do look better he returned in a voice as slow as
his gait a drawl that was a necessity for when Bibbs tried to speak
quickly he stammered Up to about a month ago it took two people to see
me They had to get me in a line between em

Edith did not turn her eyes directly toward him again after her first
quick glance and her expression in spite of her showed a faint
troubled distaste the look of a healthy person pressed by some
obligation of business to visit a bad ward in a hospital She was
nineteen fair and slim with small unequal features but a prettiness
of color and a brilliancy of eyes that created a total impression close
upon beauty Her movements were eager and restless there was something
about her as kind old ladies say that was very sweet and there was
something that was hurried and breathless This was new to Bibbs it was
a perceptible change since he had last seen her and he bent upon her
a steady whimsical scrutiny as they stood at the curb waiting for an
automobile across the street to disengage itself from the traffic

Thats the new car she said Everythings new Weve got four now
besides Jims Roscoes got two

Edith you look he began and paused

Oh WEre all well she said briskly and then as if something in
his tone had caught her as significant Well HOW do I look Bibbs

You look He paused again taking in the full length of herher trim
brown shoes her scant tapering rough skirt and her coat of brown
and green her long green tippet and her mad little rough hat in the mad
modeall suited to the October day

How do I look she insisted

You look he answered as his examination ended upon an incrusted
watch of platinum and enamel at her wrist you lookexpensive That
was a substitute for what he intended to say for her constraint and
preoccupation manifested particularly in her keeping her direct
glance away from him did not seem to grant the privilege of impulsive
intimacies

I expect I am she laughed and sidelong caught the direction of his
glance Of course I oughtnt to wear it in the daytimeits an evening
thing for the theaterbut my day wristwatch is out of gear Bobby
Lamhorn broke it yesterday hes a regular rowdy sometimes Do you want
Claus to help you in

Oh no said Bibbs Im alive And after a fit of panting subsequent
to his climbing into the car unaided he added Of course I have to
TELL people

We only got your telegram this morning she said as they began to
move rapidly through the wholesale district neighboring the station
Mother said shed hardly expected you this month

They seemed to be through with me up there in the country he
explained gently At least they said they were and they wouldnt keep
me any longer because so many really sick people wanted to get in They
told me to go homeand I didnt have any place else to go Itll be all
right Edith Ill sit in the woodshed until after dark every day

Pshaw She laughed nervously Of course were all of us glad to have
you back

Yes he said Father

Of course Didnt he write and tell you to come home She did not turn
to him with the question All the while she rode with her face directly
forward

No he said father hasnt written

She flushed a little I expect I ought tove written sometime or one
of the boys

Oh no that was all right

You cant think how busy weve all been this year Bibbs I often
planned to writeand then just as I was going to something would turn
up And Im sure its been just the same way with Jim and Roscoe Of
course we knew mamma was writing often and

Of course he said readily Theres a chunk of coal fallen on your
glove Edith Better flick it off before it smears My word Id almost
forgotten how sooty it is here

Weve been having very bright weather this monthfor us She blew the
flake of soot into the air seeming relieved

He looked up at the dingy sky wherein hung the disconsolate sun like
a cold tin pan nailed up in a smokehouse by some lunatic for a
decoration Yes said Bibbs Its very gay A few moments later as
they passed a corner Arent we going home he asked

Why yes Did you want to go somewhere else first

No Your new drivers taking us out of the way isnt he

No This is right Were going straight home

But weve passed the corner We always turned

Good gracious she cried Didnt you know wed moved Didnt you know
we were in the New House

Why no said Bibbs Are you

Weve been there a month Good gracious Didnt you know She broke
off flushing again and then went on hastily Of course mammas never
been so busy in her life we ALL havent had time to do anything but
keep on the hop Mamma couldnt even come to the station today Papas
got some of his business friends and people from around the
OLDhouse neighborhood coming tonight for a big dinner and
housewarmingdreadful kind of peoplebut mammas got it all on her
hands Shes never sat down a MINUTE and if she did papa would have
her up again before

Of course said Bibbs Do you like the new place Edith

I dont like some of the things father WOULD have in it but its the
finest house in town and that ought to be good enough for me Papa
bought one thing I likea view of the Bay of Naples in oil thats
perfectly beautiful its the first thing you see as you come in the
front hall and its eleven feet long But he would have that old
fruit picture we had in the Murphy Street house hung up in the new
diningroom You remember ita table and a watermelon sliced open
and a lot of rougedlooking apples and some shiny lemons with two dead
prairiechickens on a chair He bought it at a furniturestore years and
years ago and he claims its a finer picture than any they saw in the
museums that time he took mamma to Europe But its horribly out of
date to have those things in diningrooms and I caught Bobby Lamhorn
giggling at it and Sibyl made fun of it too with Bobby and then told
papa she agreed with him about its being such a fine thing and said he
did just right to insist on having it where he wanted it She makes me
tired Sibyl

Ediths first constraint with her brother amounting almost to
awkwardness vanished with this theme though she still kept her full
gaze always to the front even in the extreme ardor of her denunciation
of her sisterinlaw

SIBYL she repeated with such heat and vigor that the name seemed
to strike fire on her lips Id like to know why Roscoe couldnt have
married somebody from HERE that would have done us some good He could
have got in with Bobby Lamhorn years ago just as well as now and
Bobbyd have introduced him to the nicest girls in town but instead of
that he had to go and pick up this Sibyl Rink I met some awfully
nice people from her town when mamma and I were at Atlantic City last
spring and not one had ever heard of the Rinks Not even HEARD of em

I thought you were great friends with Sibyl Bibbs said

Up to the time I found her out the sister returned with continuing
vehemence Ive found out some things about Mrs Roscoe Sheridan
lately

Its only lately

Well Edith hesitated her lips setting primly Of course I
always did see that she never cared the snap of her little finger about
ROSCOE

It seems said Bibbs in laconic protest that she married him

The sister emitted a shrill cry to be interpreted as contemptuous
laughter and in her emotion spoke too impulsively Why shed have
married YOU

No no he said she couldnt be that bad

I didnt mean she began distressed I only meantI didnt mean

Never mind Edith he consoled her You see she couldnt have
married me because I didnt know her and besides if shes as
mercenary as all that shed have been too clever The head doctor even
had to lend me the money for my ticket home

I didnt mean anything unpleasant about YOU Edith babbled I only
meant I thought she was the kind of girl who was so simply crazy to
marry somebody shed have married anybody that asked her

Yes yes said Bibbs its all straight And perceiving that
his sisters expression was that of a person whose adroitness has set
matters perfectly to rights he chuckled silently

Roscoes perfectly lovely to her she continued a moment later Too
lovely If hed wake up a little and lay down the law some day like a
MAN I guess shed respect him more and learn to behave herself

Behave

Oh well I mean shes so insincere said Edith characteristically
evasive when it came to stating the very point to which she had led and
in this not unique of her sex

Bibbs contented himself with a noncommittal gesture Business
is crawling up the old streets he said his long tremulous hand
indicating a vasty structure in course of erection The boardinghouses
come first and then the

That isnt for shops she informed him Thats a new investment of
papasthe Sheridan Apartments

Well well he murmured I supposed Sheridan was almost well enough
known here already

Oh were well enough known ABOUT she said impatiently I guess
there isnt a man woman child or nigger baby in town that doesnt
know who we are But we arent in with the right people

No he exclaimed Whos all that

Whos all what

The right people

You know what I mean the best people the old familiesthe people
that have the real social position in this town and that know theyve
got it

Bibbs indulged in his silent chuckle again he seemed greatly amused I
thought that the people who actually had the real whatyoumaycallit
didnt know it he said Ive always understood that it was very
unsatisfactory because if you thought about it you didnt have it and
if you had it you didnt know it

Thats just bosh she retorted They know it in this town all right
I found out a lot of things long before we began to think of building
out in this direction The right people in this town arent always the
societycolumn ones and they mix around with outsiders and they dont
all belong to any one clubtheyre taken in all sorts into all their
clubsbut theyre a clan just the same and they have the clan feeling
and theyre just as much We Us and Company as any crowd you read about
anywhere in the world Most of em were here long before papa came and
the grandfathers of the girls of my age knew each other and

I see Bibbs interrupted gravely Their ancestors fled together
from many a stricken field and Crusaders blood flows in their veins I
always understood the first house was built by an old party of the name
of Vertrees who couldnt get along with Danl Boone and hurried away to
these parts because Danl wanted him to give back a gun hed lent him

Edith gave a little ejaculation of alarm You mustnt repeat that
story Bibbs even if its true The Vertreeses are THE best family and
of course the very oldest here they were an old family even before
Mary Vertreess greatgreatgrandfather came west and founded this
settlement He came from Lynn Massachusetts and they have relatives
there YETsome of the best people in Lynn

No exclaimed Bibbs incredulously

And there are other old families like the Vertreeses she went on
not heeding him the Lamhorns and the Kittersbys and the J Palmerston
Smiths

Strange names to me he interrupted Poor things None of them have
my acquaintance

No thats just it she cried And papa had never even heard the name
of Vertrees Mrs Vertrees went with some antismoke committee to see
him and he told her that smoke was what made her husband bring home his
wages from the payroll on Saturday night HE told us about it and I
thought I just couldnt live through the night I was so ashamed Mr
Vertrees has always lived on his income and papa didnt know him of
course Theyre the stiffist most elegant people in the whole town And
to crown it all papa went and bought the next lot to the old Vertrees
country mansionits in the very heart of the best new residence
district now and thats where the New House is right next door to
themand I must say it makes their place look rather shabby I met Mary
Vertrees when I joined the Mission Service Helpers but she never did
any more than just barely bow to me and since papas break I doubt if
shell do that They havent called

And you think if I spread this gossip about Vertrees the First stealing
Danl Boones gun the chances that they WILL call

Papa knows what a break he made with Mrs Vertrees I made him
understand that said Edith demurely and hes promised to try and
meet Mr Vertrees and be nice to him Its just this way if we dont
know THEM its practically no use in our having build the New House
and if we DO know them and theyre decent to us were right with the
right people They can do the whole thing for us Bobby Lamhorn told
Sibyl he was going to bring his mother to call on her and on mamma but
it was weeks ago and I notice he hasnt done it and if Mrs Vertrees
decides not to know us Im darn sure Mrs Lamhornll never come Thats
ONE thing Sibyl didnt manage She SAID Bobby offered to bring his
mother

You say he is a friend of Roscoes Bibbs asked

Oh hes a friend of the whole family she returned with a petulance
which she made an effort to disguise Roscoe and he got acquainted
somewhere and they take him to the theater about every other night
Sibyl has him to lunch too and keeps She broke off with an angry
little jerk of the head We can see the New House from the second
corner ahead Roscoe has built straight across the street from us you
know Honestly Sibyl makes me think of a snake sometimesthe way
she pulls the wool over peoples eyes She honeys up to papa and gets
anything in the world she wants out of him and then makes fun of him
behind his backyes and to his face but HE cant see it She got
him to give her a twelvethousanddollar porch for their house after it
was

Good heavens said Bibbs staring ahead as they reached the corner and
the car swung to the right following a bend in the street Is that the
New House

Yes What do you think of it

Well he drawled Im pretty sure the sanitariums about half a size
bigger I cant be certain till I measure

And a moment later as they entered the driveway he added seriously
But its beautiful



CHAPTER IV

It was gray stone with long roofs of thick green slate An architect
who loved the milder Gothic motives had built what he liked it was to
be seen at once that he had been left unhampered and he had wrought a
picture out of his head into a noble and exultant reality At the same
time a landscapedesigner had played so good a second with readymade
accessories of screen approach and vista that already whatever look
of newness remained upon the place was to its advantage as showing at
least one thing yet clean under the grimy sky For though the smoke was
thinner in this direction and at this long distance from the heart
of the town it was not absent and under tutelage of wind and weather
could be malignant even here where cows had wandered in the meadows and
corn had been growing not ten years gone

Altogether the New House was a success It was one of those architects
successes which leave the owners veiled in privacy it revealed nothing
of the people who lived in it save that they were rich There are houses
that cannot be detached from their own people without protesting every
inch of mortar seems to mourn the separation and such a houseno
matter what be done to itis ever murmurous with regret whispering the
old name sadly to itself unceasingly But the New House was of a kind
to change hands without emotion In our swelling cities great places
of its type are useful as financial gauges of the business tides
rich families one after another take title and occupy such houses as
fortunes rise and fallthey mark the high tide It was impossible to
imagine a childs toy wagon left upon a walk or driveway of the New
House and yet it wasas Bibbs rightly called itbeautiful

What the architect thought of the Golfo di Napoli which hung in its
vast gold revel of rococo frame against the gray wood of the hall is to
be conjecturedperhaps he had not seen it

Edith did you say only eleven feet Bibbs panted staring at it as
the whitejacketed twin of a Pullman porter helped him to get out of his
overcoat

Eleven without the frame she explained Its splendid dont you
think It lightens things up so The hall was kind of gloomy before

No gloom now said Bibbs

This statue in the corner is pretty too she remarked Mamma and I
bought that And Bibbs turned at her direction to behold amid a
grove of tubbed palms a lifesize blackbearded Moor of a plastic
composition painted with unappeasable gloss and brilliancy Upon his
chocolate head he wore a gold turban in his hand he held a goldtipped
spear and for the rest he was red and yellow and black and silver

Hallelujah was the sole comment of the returned wanderer and Edith
saying she would find mamma left him blinking at the Moor Presently
after she had disappeared he turned to the colored man who stood
waiting Bibbss travelingbag in his hand What do YOU think of it
Bibbs asked solemnly

Gran replied the servitor She mighty hard to dus Dus git in all
em wrinkles Yessuh she mighty hard to dus

I expect she must be said Bibbs his glance returning reflectively
to the black bull beard for a moment Is there a place anywhere I could
lie down

Yessuh We got one nem spare rooms all fix up fo you suh Right up
staihs suh Nice room

He led the way and Bibbs followed slowly stopping at intervals to
rest and noting a heavy increase in the staff of service since the
exodus from the old house Maids and scrubwomen were at work under the
patently nominal direction of another Pullman porter who was profoundly
enjoying his own affectation of being harassed with care

Evything got look spick an span fo the big doins tonight Bibbss
guide explained chuckling Yessuh we got big doins tonight Big
doins

The room to which he conducted his lagging charge was furnished in
every particular like a room in a new hotel and Bibbs found it
pleasantthough indeed any room with a good bed would have
seemed pleasant to him after his journey He stretched himself flat
immediately and having replied Not now to the attendants offer to
unpack the bag closed his eyes wearily

Whitejacket racially sympathetic lowered the windowshades and made
an exit on tiptoe encountering the other whitejacketthe harassed
overseerin the hall without Said the emerging one He mighty shaky
Mist Jackson Drop right down an shet his eyes Eyelids all black
Rich folks gotta go same as anybody else Anybody ast me if I change
ith at ole boyNo suh Lem keep is money I keep my black skin an
keep out the ground

Mr Jackson expressed the same preference Yessuh he look tuh me like
somebody awready laid out he concluded And upon the stairway landing
near by two old women on allfours at their work were likewise
pessimistic

Hech said one lamenting in a whisper It give me a turn to see him
go bywhite as wax an bony as a dead fish Mrs Cronin tell me dit
make ye kind o sick to look at um

Sick No more than the face of a blessed angel already in heaven

Well said the other Id a by o me own come home t die once
She fell silent at a rustling of skirts in the corridor above them

It was Mrs Sheridan hurrying to greet her son

She was one of those fat pink people who fade and contract with age
like drying fruit and her outside was a true portrait of her Her
husband and her daughter had long ago absorbed her What intelligence
she had was given almost wholly to comprehending and serving those
two and except in the presence of one of them she was nearly always
absentminded Edith lived all day with her mother as daughters do and
Sheridan so held his wife to her unity with him that she had long ago
become unconscious of her existence as a thing separate from his She
invariably perceived his moods and nursed him through them when she
did not share them and she gave him a profound sympathy with the inmost
spirit and purpose of his being even though she did not comprehend it
and partook of it only as a spectator They had known but one actual
altercation in their lives and that was thirty years past in the early
days of Sheridans struggle when in order to enhance the favorable
impression he believed himself to be making upon some capitalists he
had thought it necessary to accompany them to a performance of The
Black Crook But she had not once referred to this during the last ten
years

Mrs Sheridans manner was hurried and inconsequent her clothes rustled
more than other womens clothes she seemed to wear too many at a time
and to be vaguely troubled by them and she was patting a skirt down
over some unruly internal dissension at the moment she opened Bibbss
door

At sight of the recumbent figure she began to close the door softly
withdrawing but the young man had heard the turning of the knob and the
rustling of skirts and he opened his eyes

Dont go mother he said Im not asleep He swung his long legs
over the side of the bed to rise but she set a hand on his shoulder
restraining him and he lay flat again

No she said bending over to kiss his cheek I just come for a
minute but I want to see how you seem Edith said

Poor Edith he murmured She couldnt look at me She

Nonsense Mrs Sheridan having let in the light at a window came
back to the bedside You look a great deal better than what you did
before you went to the sanitarium anyway Its done you good a body
can see that right away You need fatting up of course and you havent
got much color

No he said I havent much color

But you will have when you get your strength back

Oh yes he responded cheerfully THEN I will

You look a great deal better than what I expected

Edith must have a great vocabulary he chuckled

Shes too sensitive said Mrs Sheridan and it makes her exaggerate
a little What about your diet

Thats all right They told me to eat anything

Anything at all

Wellanything I could

Thats good she said nodding They mean for you just to build up
your strength Thats what they told me the last time I went to see you
at the sanitarium You look better than what you did then and thats
only a little time ago How long was it

Eight months I think

No it couldnt be I know it aint THAT long but maybe it was
longern I thought And this last month or so I havent had scarcely
even time to write more than just a line to ask how you were gettin
along but I told Edith to write the weeks I couldnt and I asked
Jim to too and they both said they would so I suppose youve kept up
pretty well on the home news

Oh yes

What I think you need said the mother gravely is to liven up a
little and take an interest in things Thats what papa was sayin this
morning after we got your telegram and thats whatll stimilate your
appetite too He was talkin over his plans for you

Plans Bibbs turning on his side shielded his eyes from the light
with his hand so that he might see her better What He paused
What plans is he making for me mother

She turned away going back to the window to draw down the shade
Well you better talk it over with HIM she said with perceptible
nervousness He better tell you himself I dont feel as if I had any
call exactly to go into it and you better get to sleep now anyway
She came and stood by the bedside once more But you must remember
Bibbs whatever papa does is for the best He loves his chuldern and
wants to do whats right by ALL of emand youll always find hes
right in the end

He made a little gesture of assent which seemed to content her and
she rustled to the door turning to speak again after she had opened it
You get a good nap now so as to be all rested up for tonight

Youyou meanhe Bibbs stammered having begun to speak too
quickly Checking himself he drew a long breath then asked quietly
Does father expect me to come downstairs this evening

Well I think he does she answered You see its the
housewarming as he calls it and he said he thinks all our chuldern
ought to be around us as well as the old friends and other folks Its
just what he thinks you needto take an interest and liven up You
dont feel too bad to come down do you

Mother

Well

Take a good look at me he said

Oh see here she cried with brusque cheerfulness Youre not so bad
off as you think you are Bibbs Youre on the mend and it wont do you
any harm to please your

It isnt that he interrupted Honestly Im only afraid it might
spoil somebodys appetite Edith

I told you the child was too sensitive she interrupted in turn
Youre a plenty goodlookin enough young man for anybody You look
like you been through a long spell and begun to get well and thats all
there is to it

All right Ill come to the party If the rest of you can stand it I
can

It ll do you good she returned rustling into the hall Now take
a nap and Ill send one o the help to wake you in time for you to get
dressed up before dinner You go to sleep right away now Bibbs

Bibbs was unable to obey though he kept his eyes closed Something
she had said kept running in his mind repeating itself over and over
interminably His plans for youhis plans for youhis plans for
youhis plans for you And then taking the place of his plans for
you after what seemed a long long while her flurried voice came
back to him insistently seeming to whisper in his ear He loves his
chuldernhe loves his chuldernhe loves his chuldernyoull find
hes always rightyoull find hes always right Until at last as he
drifted into the state of halfdreams and distorted realities the voice
seemed to murmur from beyond a great black wing that came out of the
wall and stretched over his bedit was a black wing within the room
and at the same time it was a black cloud crossing the sky bridging the
whole earth from pole to pole It was a cloud of black smoke and out
of the heart of it came a flurried voice whispering over and over His
plans for youhis plans for youhis plans for you And then there
was nothing

He woke refreshed stretched himself gingerlyas one might have a care
against too quick or too long a pull upon a frayed elasticand getting
to his feet went blinking to the window and touched the shade so that
it flew up letting in a pale sunset

He looked out into the lemoncolored light and smiled wanly at the
next house as Ediths grandiose phrase came to mind the old Vertrees
country mansion It stood in a broad lawn which was separated from the
Sheridans by a young hedge and it was a big square plain old box
of a house with a giant saltcellar atop for a cupola Paint had been
spared for a long time and no one could have put a name to the color of
it but in spite of that the place had no look of being out at heel and
the sward was as neatly trimmed as the Sheridans own

The separating hedge ran almost beneath Bibbss windowfor this wing of
the New House extended here almost to the edge of the lotand directly
opposite the window the Vertreeses lawn had been graded so as to make
a little knoll upon which stood a small rustic summerhouse It was
almost on a level with Bibbss window and not thirty feet away and
it was easy for him to imagine the present dynasty of Vertreeses
in grievous outcry when they had found this retreat ruined by the
juxtaposition of the parvenu intruder Probably the summerhouse was
pleasant and pretty in summer It had the look of a place wherein little
girls had played for a generation or so with dolls and housekeeping
or where a lovely old lady might come to read something dull on warm
afternoons but now in the thin light it was desolate the color of
dust and hung with haggard vines which had lost their leaves

Bibbs looked at it with grave sympathy probably feeling some kinship
with anything so dismantled then he turned to a chevalglass beside the
window and paid himself the dubious tribute of a thorough inspection He
looked the mirror up and down slowly repeatedly but came in the end
to a long and earnest scrutiny of the face Throughout this cryptic
seance his manner was profoundly impersonal he had the air of an
entomologist intent upon classifying a specimen but finally he appeared
to become pessimistic He shook his head solemnly then gazed again
and shook his head again and continued to shake it slowly in complete
disapproval

You certainly are one horrible sight he said aloud

And at that he was instantly aware of an observer Turning quickly
he was vouchsafed the picture of a charming lady framed in a
rustic aperture of the summerhouse and staring full into his
windowstraight into his eyes too for the infinitesimal fraction of
a second before the flashingly censorious withdrawal of her own
Composedly she pulled several dead twigs from a vine the manner of her
action conveying a message or proclamation to the effect that she was in
the summerhouse for the sole purpose of suchlike pruning and tending
and that no gentleman could suppose her presence there to be due to any
other purpose whatsoever or that being there on that account she
had allowed her attention to wander for one instant in the direction of
things of which she was in reality unconscious

Having pulled enough twigs to emphasize her unconsciousnessand at the
same time her disapprovalof everything in the nature of a Sheridan
or belonging to a Sheridan she descended the knoll with maintained
composure and sauntered toward a sidedoor of the country mansion of
the Vertreeses An elderly lady bonneted and cloaked opened the door
and came to meet her

Are you ready Mary Ive been looking for you What were you doing

Nothing Just looking into one of Sheridans windows said Mary
Vertrees I got caught at it

Mary cried her mother Just as we were going to call Good heavens

Well go just the same the daughter returned I suppose those women
would be glad to have us if wed burned their house to the ground

But WHO saw you insisted Mrs Vertrees

One of the sons I suppose he was I believe hes insane or something
At least I hear they keep him in a sanitarium somewhere and never talk
about him He was staring at himself in a mirror and talking to himself
Then he looked out and caught me

What did he

Nothing of course

How did he look

Like a ghost in a blue suit said Miss Vertrees moving toward the
street and waving a whitegloved hand in farewell to her father who
was observing them from the window of his library Rather tragic and
altogether impossible Do come on mother and lets get it over

And Mrs Vertrees with many misgivings set forth with her daughter for
their gracious assault upon the New House next door



CHAPTER V

Mr Vertrees having watched their departure with the air of a man who
had something at hazard upon the expedition turned from the window and
began to pace the library thoughtfully pending their return He was
about sixty a small man withered and dry and fine a trim little
sketch of an elderly dandy His lambrequin mustacherelic of a
forgotten Anglomaniahad been profoundly black but now like his
smooth hair it was approaching an equally sheer whiteness and though
his clothes were old they had shapeliness and a flavor of mode And for
greater spruceness there were some jaunty touches gray spats a narrow
black ribbon across the gray waistcoat to the eyeglasses in a pocket
a fleck of color from a button in the lapel of the black coat labeling
him the descendant of patriot warriors

The room was not like him being cheerful and hideous whereas Mr
Vertrees was anxious and decorative Under a mantel of imitation black
marble a merry little coalfire beamed forth upon high and narrow
Eastlake bookcases with long glass doors and upon comfortable
incongruous furniture and upon meaningless woodwork everywhere
and upon half a dozen Landseer engravings which Mr and Mrs Vertrees
sometimes mentioned to each other after thirty years of possession as
very fine things They had been the first people in town to possess
Landseer engravings and there in art they had rested but they still
had a feeling that in all such matters they were in the van and when
Mr Vertrees discovered Landseers upon the walls of other peoples
houses he thawed as a chieftain to a trusted follower and if he
found an edition of Bulwer Lytton accompanying the Landseers as a final
corroboration of culture he would say inevitably Those people know
good pictures and they know good books

The growth of the city which might easily have made him a millionaire
had ruined him because he had failed to understand it When towns begin
to grow they have whims and the whims of a town always ruin somebody
Mr Vertrees had been most strikingly the somebody in this case At
about the time he bought the Landseers he owned through inheritance
an officebuilding and a large house not far from it where he spent the
winter and he had a country placea farm of four hundred acreswhere
he went for the summers to the comfortable ugly old house that was his
home now perforce all the year round If he had known how to sit
still and let things happen he would have prospered miraculously but
strangely enough the dainty little man was one of the first to fall
down and worship Bigness the which proceeded straightway to enact the
role of Juggernaut for his better education He was a true prophet of
the prodigious growth but he had a fatal gift for selling good and
buying bad He should have stayed at home and looked at his Landseers
and read his Bulwer but he took his cow to market and the trained
milkers milked her dry and then ate her He sold the officebuilding and
the house in town to buy a great tract of lots in a new suburb then
he sold the farm except the house and the ground about it to pay the
taxes on the suburban lots and to keep them up The lots refused to
stay up but he had to do something to keep himself and his family up
so in despair he sold the lots which went up beautifully the next year
for traction stock that was paying dividends and thereafter he ceased
to buy and sell Thus he disappeared altogether from the commercial
surface at about the time James Sheridan came out securely on top and
Sheridan until Mrs Vertrees called upon him with her antismoke
committee had never heard the name

Mr Vertrees pinched retired to his Landseers and Mrs Vertrees
managed somehow on the dividends though managing became more and
more difficult as the years went by and money bought less and less But
there came a day when three servitors of Bigness in Philadelphia took
greedy counsel with four fellowworshipers from New York and not long
after that there were no more dividends for Mr Vertrees In fact there
was nothing for Mr Vertrees because the traction stock henceforth
was no stock at all and he had mortgaged his house long ago to help
manage somehow according to his conception of his position in
lifeone of his own oldfashioned phrases Six months before the
completion of the New House next door Mr Vertrees had sold his horses
and the worn Victoria and stationwagon to pay the arrears of his two
servants and reestablish credit at the grocers and butchersand a
pair of elderly carriagehorses with such accoutrements are not very
ample barter in these days for six months food and fuel and service
Mr Vertrees had discovered too that there was no salary for him in
all the buzzing cityhe could do nothing

It may be said that he was at the end of his string Such times do come
in all their bitterness finally to the man with no trade or craft if
his feeble clutch on that slippery ghost Property shall fail

The windows grew black while he paced the room and smoky twilight
closed round about the house yet not more darkly than what closed round
about the heart of the anxious little man patrolling the fanshaped zone
of firelight But as the mantel clock struck wheezily six there was the
rattle of an outer door and a rich and beautiful peal of laughter went
ringing through the house Thus cheerfully did Mary Vertrees herald her
return with her mother from their expedition among the barbarians

She came rushing into the library and threw herself into a deep chair by
the hearth laughing so uncontrollably that tears were in her eyes Mrs
Vertrees followed decorously no mirth about her on the contrary
she looked vaguely disturbed as if she had eaten something not quite
certain to agree with her and regretted it

Papa Oh oh And Miss Vertrees was fain to apply a handkerchief upon
her eyes Im SO glad you made us go I wouldnt have missed it

Mrs Vertrees shook her head I suppose Im very dull she said
gently I didnt see anything amusing Theyre most ordinary and the
house is altogether in bad taste but we anticipated that and

Papa Mary cried breaking in They asked us to DINNER

What

And Im GOING she shouted and was seized with fresh paroxysms
Think of it Never in their house before never met any of them but the
daughterand just BARELY met her

What about you interrupted Mr Vertrees turning sharply upon his
wife

She made a little face as if positive now that what she had eaten would
not agree with her I couldnt she said I

Yes thats justjust the way sheshe looked when they asked her
cried Mary choking And then sheshe realized it and tried to turn
it into a cough and she didnt know how and it sounded likelike a
squeal

I suppose said Mrs Vertrees much injured that Mary will have an
uproarious time at my funeral She makes fun of

Mary jumped up instantly and kissed her then she went to the mantel
and leaning an elbow upon it gazed thoughtfully at the buckle of her
shoe twinkling in the firelight

THEY didnt notice anything she said So far as they were concerned
mamma it was one of the finest coughs you ever coughed

Who were they asked her father Whom did you see

Only the mother and daughter Mary answered Mrs Sheridan is dumpy
and rustly and Miss Sheridan is pretty and pushingdresses by the
fashion magazines and talks about New York people that have
their pictures in em She tutors the mother but not very
successfullypartly because her own foundation is too flimsy and partly
because she began too late Theyve got an enormous Moor of painted
plaster or something in the hall and the girl evidently thought it was
to her credit that she selected it

They have oilpaintings too added Mrs Vertrees with a glance of
gentle price at the Landseers Ive always thought oilpaintings in a
private house the worst of taste

Oh if one owned a Raphael or a Titian said Mr Vertrees finishing
the implication not in words but with a wave of his hand Go on
Mary None of the rest of them came in You didnt meet Mr Sheridan
or He paused and adjusted a lump of coal in the fire delicately with
the poker Or one of the sons

Marys glance crossed his at that with a flash of utter comprehension
He turned instantly away but she had begun to laugh again

No she said no one except the women but mamma inquired about the
sons thoroughly

Mary Mrs Vertrees protested

Oh most adroitly too laughed the girl Only she couldnt help
unconsciously turning to look at mewhen she did it

Mary Vertrees

Never mind mamma Mrs Sheridan and Miss Sheridan neither of THEM
could help unconsciously turning to look at mespeculativelyat the
same time They all three kept looking at me and talking about the
oldest son Mr James Sheridan Junior Mrs Sheridan said his father is
very anxious to get Jim to marry and settle down and she assured me
that Jim is right cultivated Another of the sons the youngest one
caught me looking in the window this afternoon but they didnt seem
to consider him quite one of themselves somehow though Mrs Sheridan
mentioned that a couple of years or so ago he had been right sick
and had been to some cure or other They seemed relieved to bring the
subject back to Jim and his virtuesand to look at me The other
brother is the middle one Roscoe hes the one that owns the new house
across the street where that young blacksheep of the Lamhorns Robert
goes so often I saw a short dark young man standing on the porch with
Robert Lamhorn there the other day so I suppose that was Roscoe Jim
still lurks in the mists but I shall meet him tonight Papa She
stepped nearer to him so that he had to face her and his eyes were
troubled as he did There may have been a trouble deep within her own
but she kept their surface merry with laughter Papa Bibbs is the
youngest ones name and Bibbsto the best of our informationis a
lunatic Roscoe is married Papa does it have to be Jim

Mary Mrs Vertrees cried sharply Youre outrageous Thats a
perfectly horrible way of talking

Well Im close to twentyfour said Mary turning to her I havent
been able to like anybody yet thats asked me to marry him and maybe I
never shall Until a year or so ago Ive had everything I ever wanted in
my lifeyou and papa gave it all to meand its about time I began
to pay back Unfortunately I dont know how to do anythingbut
somethings got to be done

But you neednt talk of it like THAT insisted the mother
plaintively Its notits not

No its not said Mary I know that

How did they happen to ask you to dinner Mr Vertrees inquired
uneasily Stextrawdnry thing

Climbers hospitality Mary defined it We were so very cordial and
easy I think Mrs Sheridan herself might have done it just as any kind
old woman on a farm might ask a neighbor but it was Miss Sheridan who
did it She played around it awhile you could see she wanted toshes
in a dreadful hurry to get into thingsand I fancied she had an idea it
might impress that Lamhorn boy to find us there tonight Its a sort of
housewarming dinner and they talked about it and talked about itand
then the girl got her courage up and blurted out the invitation And
mamma Here Mary was once more a victim to incorrigible merriment
Mamma tried to say yes and COULDNT She swallowed and squealedI
mean you coughed dear And then papa she said that you and she had
promised to go to a lecture at the Emerson Club tonight but that her
daughter would be delighted to come to the Big Show So there I am
and theres Mr Jim Sheridanand theres the clock Dinners at
seventhirty

And she ran out of the room scooping up her fallen furs with a gesture
of flying grace as she sped

When she came down at twenty minutes after seven her father stood in
the hall at the foot of the stairs waiting to be her escort through
the dark He looked up and watched her as she descended and his gaze
was fond and proudand profoundly disturbed But she smiled and nodded
gaily and when she reached the floor put a hand on his shoulder

At least no one could suspect me tonight she said I LOOK rich
dont I papa

She did She had a look that worshipful girl friends bravely called
regal A head taller than her father she was as straight and jauntily
poised as a boy athlete and her brown hair and her brown eyes were
like her mothers but for the rest she went back to some stronger and
livelier ancestor than either of her parents

Dont I look too rich to be suspected she insisted

You look everything beautiful Mary he said huskily

And my dress She threw open her dark velvet cloak showing a splendor
of white and silver Anything better at Nice next winter do you
think She laughed shrouding her glittering figure in the cloak again
Two years old and no one would dream it I did it over

You can do anything Mary

There was a curious humility in his tone and something morea
significance not veiled and yet abysmally apologetic It was as if
he suggested something to her and begged her forgiveness in the same
breath

And upon that for the moment she became as serious as he She lifted
her hand from his shoulder and then set it back more firmly so that he
should feel the reassurance of its pressure

Dont worry she said in a low voice and gravely I know exactly
what you want me to do



CHAPTER VI

It was a brave and lustrous banquet and a noisy one too because there
was an orchestra among some plants at one end of the long diningroom
and after a preliminary stiffness the guests were impelled to
conversenecessarily at the tops of their voices The whole company
of fifty sat at a great oblong table improvised for the occasion by
carpenters but not betraying itself as an improvisation it seemed
a permanent continent of damask and lace with shores of crystal and
silver running up to spreading groves of orchids and lilies and
white rosesan inhabited continent evidently for there were three
marvelous gleaming buildings one in the center and one at each end
white miracles wrought by some inspired craftsman in sculptural icing
They were models in miniature and they represented the Sheridan
Building the Sheridan Apartments and the Pump Works Nearly all the
guests recognized them without having to be told what they were and
pronounced the likenesses superb

The arrangement of the table was visibly baronial At the head sat the
great Thane with the flower of his family and of the guests about him
then on each side came the neighbors of the old house grading down to
vassals and retainerssuperintendents cashiers heads of departments
and the likeat the foot where the Thanes lady took her place as a
consolation for the less important Here too among the thralls and
bondmen sat Bibbs Sheridan a meek Banquo wondering how anybody could
look at him and eat

Nevertheless there was a vast continuous eating for these were
wholesome folk who understood that dinner meant something intended
for introduction into the system by means of an aperture in the face
devised by nature for that express purpose And besides nobody looked
at Bibbs

He was better content to be left to himself his voice was not strong
enough to make itself heard over the hubbub without an exhausting
effort and the talk that went on about him was too fast and too
fragmentary for his drawl to keep pace with it So he felt relieved when
each of his neighbors in turn after a polite inquiry about his health
turned to seek livelier responses in other directions For the talk
went on with the eating incessantly It rose over the throbbing of the
orchestra and the clatter and clinking of silver and china and glass
and there was a mighty babble

Yes sir Started without a dollar Yellow flounces on the
overskirt I says Wilkie your departments got to go bigger
this year I says Fifteen per cent turnover in thirtyone
weeks One of the biggest men in the biggest The wife says
shell have to let out my pants if my appetite Say did you see
that statue of a Turk in the hall One of the finest things I ever
Not a dollar not a nickel not one red cent do you get out o me I
says and so he ups and Yes the baby makes four theyve lost
now Well they got their raise and they went in big Yes
sir Not a dollar to his name and look at what You wait The
population of this towns goin to hit the million mark before she
stops Well if you can show me a bigger deal than

And through the interstices of this clamoring Bibbs could hear the
continual booming of his fathers heavy voice and once he caught the
sentence Yes young lady thats just what did it for me and thats
just whatll do it for my boysthey got to make two blades o grass
grow where one grew before It was his familiar flourish an old
story to Bibbs and now jovially declaimed for the edification of Mary
Vertrees

It was a great night for Sheridanthe very crest of his wave He sat
there knowing himself Thane and master by his own endeavor and his big
smooth red face grew more and more radiant with good will and with the
simplest happiest most boylike vanity He was the picture of health
of good cheer and of power on a holiday He had thirty teeth none
bought and showed most of them when he laughed his grizzled hair was
thick and as unruly as a farm laborers his chest was deep and big
beneath its vast facade of starched white linen where little diamonds
twinkled circling three large pearls his hands were stubby and strong
and he used them freely in gestures of marked picturesqueness and
though he had grown fat at chin and waist and wrist he had not lost the
look of readiness and activity

He dominated the table shouting jocular questions and railleries at
every one His idea was that when people were having a good time they
were noisy and his own additions to the hubbub increased his pleasure
and of course met the warmest encouragement from his guests Edith had
discovered that he had very foggy notions of the difference between a
band and an orchestra and when it was made clear to him he had held out
for a band until Edith threatened tears but the size of the orchestra
they hired consoled him and he had now no regrets in the matter

He kept time to the music continuallywith his feet or pounding on the
table with his fist and sometimes with spoon or knife upon his plate
or a glass without permitting these sideproducts to interfere with the
real business of eating and shouting

Tell em to play Nancy Lee he would bellow down the length of
the table to his wife while the musicians were in the midst of the
Toreador song perhaps Ask that fellow if they dont know Nancy
Lee And when the leader would shake his head apologetically in answer
to an obedient shriek from Mrs Sheridan the Toreador continuing
vehemently Sheridan would roar halfremembered fragments of Nancy
Lee naturally mingling some Bizet with the air of that uxorious
tribute

Oh there she stands and waves her hands while Im away A sailers
wife a sailers star should be Yo ho oh oh Oh Nancy Nancy Nancy
Lee Oh Nahancy Lee

HAY there old lady he would bellow Tell em to play In the
Gloaming In the gloaming oh my darling lalalumteeWell if they
dont know that whats the matter with Larboard Watch Ahoy THATS
good music Thats the kind o music I like Come on now Mrs Callin
get em singin down in your part o the table Whats the matter you
folks down there anyway Larboard watch ahoy

What joy he feels astatumdumteedeedum steals Laarboard
watch ahoy

No external bubbling contributed to this effervescence the Sheridans
table had never borne wine and more because of timidity about it than
conviction it bore none now though mineral waters were copiously
poured from bottles wrapped for some reason in napkins and proved
wholly satisfactory to almost all of the guests And certainly no wine
could have inspired more turbulent good spirits in the host Not even
Bibbs was an alloy in this nights happiness for as Mrs Sheridan had
said he had plans for Bibbsplans which were going to straighten out
some things that had gone wrong

So he pounded the table and boomed his echoes of old songs and then
forgetting these would renew his friendly railleries or perhaps
turning to Mary Vertrees who sat near him round the corner of the
table at his right he would become autobiographical Gentlemen less
naive than he had paid her that tribute for she was a girl who inspired
the autobiographical impulse in every man who met herit needed but the
sight of her

The dinner seemed somehow to center about Mary Vertrees and the
jocund host as a play centers about its hero and heroine they were the
rubicund king and the starry princess of this spectaclethey paid court
to each other and everybody paid court to them Down near the
sugar Pump Works where Bibbs sat there was audible speculation and
admiration Wonder who that lady ismakin such a hit with the old
man Must be some heiress Heiress Golly I guess I could stand it
to marry rich then

Edith and Sibyl were radiant at first they had watched Miss Vertrees
with an almost haggard anxiety wondering what disasterous effect
Sheridans pastoral gaietiesand other thingswould have upon her
but she seemed delighted with everything and with him most of all
She treated him as if he were some delicious foolish old joke that
she understood perfectly laughing at him almost violently when he
braggedprobably his first experience of that kind in his life It
enchanted him

As he proclaimed to the table she had a way with her She had
indeed as Roscoe Sheridan upon her right discovered just after the
feast began Since his marriage three years before no lady had bestowed
upon him so protracted a full view of brilliant eyes and with the
look his lovely neighbor saidand it was her first speech to him

I hope youre very susceptible Mr Sheridan

Honest Roscoe was taken aback and Why was all he managed to say

She repeated the look deliberately which was noted with a
mystification equal to his own by his sister across the table No one
reflected Edith could image Mary Vertrees the sort of girl who would
really flirt with married menshe was obviously the opposite of all
that Edith defined her as a thoroughbred a nice girl and the
look given to Roscoe was astounding Roscoes wife saw it too and
she was another whom it puzzledthough not because its recipient was
married

Because said Mary Vertrees replying to Roscoes monosyllable And
also because were nextdoor neighbors at table and its dull times
ahead for both of us if we dont get along

Roscoe was a literal young man all stocks and bonds and he had been
brought up to believe that when a man married he married and settled
down It was all right he felt for a man as old as his father to
pay florid compliments to as pretty a girl as this Miss Vertrees but
for himselfa young married manit wouldnt do and it wouldnt
even be quite moral He knew that young married people might have
friendships like his wifes for Lamhorn but Sibyl and Lamhorn never
flirtedthey were always very matteroffact with each other Roscoe
would have been troubled if Sibyl had ever told Lamhorn she hoped he was
susceptible

Yeswere neighbors he said awkwardly

Nextdoor neighbors in houses too she added

No not exactly I live across the street

Why no she exclaimed and seemed startled Your mother told me this
afternoon that you lived at home

Yes of course I live at home I built that new house across the
street

But you she paused confused and then slowly a deep color came into
her cheek But I understood

No he said my wife and I lived with the old folks the first year
but thats all Edith and Jim live with them of course

II see she said the deep color still deepening as she turned from
him and saw written upon a card before the gentleman at her left the
name Mr James Sheridan Jr And from that moment Roscoe had little
enough cause for wondering what he ought to reply to her disturbing
coquetries

Mr James Sheridan had been anxiously waiting for the dazzling visitor
to get through with old Roscoe as he thought of it and give a
bachelor a chance Old Roscoe was the younger but he had always been
the steady wheelhorse of the family Jim was steady enough but was
considered livelier than Roscoe which in truth is not saying much for
Jims liveliness As their father habitually boasted both brothers were
capable hardworking young business men and the principal difference
between them was merely that which resulted from Jims being still a
bachelor Physically they were of the same type dark of eyes and of
hair freshcolored and thickset and though Roscoe was several inches
taller than Jim neither was of the height breadth or depth of the
father Both wore young business mens mustaches and either could have
sat for the tailorshop lithographs of young business men wearing rich
suitings in dark mixtures

Jim approving warmly of his neighbors profile perceived her access of
color which increased his approbation Whats that old Roscoe saying
to you Miss Vertrees he asked These young married men are mighty
forward nowadays but you mustnt let em make you blush

Am I blushing she said Are you sure And with that she gave him
ample opportunity to make sure repeating with interest the look wasted
upon Roscoe I think you must be mistaken she continued I think
its your brother who is blushing Ive thrown him into confusion

How

She laughed and then leaning to him a little said in a tone as
confidential as she could make it under cover of the uproar By trying
to begin with him a courtship I meant for YOU

This might well be a style new to Jim and it was He supposed it a
nonsensical form of badinage and yet it took his breath He realized
that he wished what she said to be the literal truth and he was
instantly snared by that realization

By George he said I guess youre the kind of girl that can say
anythingyes and get away with it too

She laughed againin her way so that he could not tell whether she was
laughing at him or at herself or at the nonsense she was talking and
she said But you see I dont care whether I get away with it or not
I wish youd tell me frankly if you think Ive got a change to get away
with YOU

More like if youve got a chance to get away FROM me Jim was inspired
to reply Not one in the world especially after beginning by making
fun of me like that

I mightnt be so much in fun as you think she said regarding him
with sudden gravity

Well said Jim in simple honesty youre a funny girl

Her gravity continued an instant longer I may not turn out to be funny
for YOU

So long as you turn out to be anything at all for me I expect I can
manage to be satisfied And with that to his own surprise it was his
turn to blush whereupon she laughed again

Yes he said plaintively not wholly lacking intuition I can see
youre the sort of girl that would laugh the minute you see a man really
means anything

Laugh she cried gaily Why it might be a matter of life and
death But if you want tragedy Id better put the question at once
considering the mistake I made with your brother

Jim was dazed She seemed to be playing a little game of mockery and
nonsense with him but he had glimpses of a flashing danger in it
he was but too sensible of being outclassed and had somewhere a
consciousness that he could never quite know this giddy and alluring
lady no matter how long it pleased her to play with him But he
mightily wanted her to keep on playing with him

Put what question he said breathlessly

As you are a new neighbor of mine and of my family she returned
speaking slowly and with a crossexaminers severity I think it would
be well for me to know at once whether you are already walking out with
any young lady or not Mr Sheridan think well Are you spoken for

Not yet he gasped Are you

NO she cried and with that they both laughed again and the pastime
proceeded increasing both in its gaiety and in its gravity

Observing its continuance Mr Robert Lamhorn opposite turned from a
lively conversation with Edith and remarked covertly to Sibyl that Miss
Vertrees was starting rather picturesquely with Jim And he added
languidly Do you suppose she WOULD

For the moment Sibyl gave no sign of having heard him but seemed
interested in the clasp of a long rope of pearls a loop of which she
was allowing to swing from her fingers resting her elbow upon the table
and following with her eyes the twinkle of diamonds and platinum in the
clasp at the end of the loop She wore many jewels She was pretty
but hers was not the kind of prettiness to be loaded with too sumptuous
accessories and jeweled headdresses are dangerousthey may emphasize
the wrongness of the wearer

I said Miss Vertrees seems to be starting pretty strong with Jim
repeated Mr Lamhorn

I heard you There was a latent discontent always somewhere in her
eyes no matter what she threw upon the surface of cover it and just
now she did not care to cover it she looked sullen Starting any
stronger than you did with Edith she inquired

Oh keep the peace he said crossly Thats off of course

You havent been making her see it this eveningprecisely said
Sibyl looking at him steadily Youve talked to her for

For Heavens sake he begged keep the peace

Well what have you just been doing

SH he said Listen to your fatherinlaw

Sheridan was booming and braying louder than ever the orchestra having
begun to play The Rosary to his vast content

I COUNT THEM OVER LALATUMTEEDUM he roared beating the measures
with his fork EACH HOUR A PEARL EACH PEARL TEEDUMTUMDUMWhats
the matter with all you folks Whynt you SING Miss Vertrees I bet a
thousand dollars YOU sing Whynt

Mr Sheridan she said turning cheerfully from the ardent Jim you
dont know what you interrupted Your son isnt used to my rough ways
and my soldiers wooing frightens him but I think he was about to say
something important

Ill say something important to him if he doesnt the father
threatened more delighted with her than ever By gosh if I was his
ageor a widower right NOW

Oh wait cried Mary If theyd only make less noise I want Mrs
Sheridan to hear

Shed say the same he shouted Shed tell me I was mighty slow if I
couldnt get ahead o Jim Why when I was his age

You must listen to your father Mary interrupted turning to Jim who
had grown red again Hes going to tell us how when he was your age
he made those two blades of grass grow out of a teacupand you could
see for yourself he didnt get them out of his sleeve

At that Sheridan pounded the table till it jumped Look here young
lady he roared Some o these days Im either goin to slap youor
Im goin to kiss you

Edith looked aghast she was afraid this was indeed too awful but
Mary Vertrees burst into ringing laughter

Both she cried Both The one to make me forget the other

But which he began and then suddenly gave forth such stentorian
trumpetings of mirth that for once the whole table stopped to listen
Jim he roared if you dont propose to that girl tonight Ill send
you back to the machineshop with Bibbs

And Bibbsdown among the retainers by the sugar Pump Works and
watching Mary Vertrees as a ragged boy in the street might watch a rich
little girl in a gardenBibbs heard He heardand he knew what his
fathers plans were now



CHAPTER VII

Mrs Vertrees sat up for her daughter Mr Vertrees having retired
after a restless evening not much soothed by the society of his
Landseers Mary had taken a key insisting that he should not come for
her and seeming confident that she would not lack for escort nor did
the sequel prove her confidence unwarranted But Mrs Vertrees had a
long vigil of it

She was not the woman to make herself easyno servant had ever seen her
in a wrapperand with her hair and dress and her shoes just what they
had been when she returned from the afternoons call she sat through
the slow night hours in a stiff little chair under the gaslight in her
own room which was directly over the front hall There book in hand
she employed the time in her own reminiscences though it was her belief
that she was reading Madame de Remusats

Her thoughts went backward into her life and into her husbands and the
deeper into the past they went the brighter the pictures they brought
herand there is tragedy Like her husband she thought backward
because she did not dare think forward definitely What thinking forward
this troubled couple ventured took the form of a slender hope which
neither of them could have borne to hear put in words and yet they
had talked it over day after day from the very hour when they heard
Sheridan was to build his New House next door Forso quickly does
any ideal of human behavior become an antiquetheir youth was of the
innocent old days so dead of breeding and gentility and no craft
had been more straitly trained upon them than that of talking about
things without mentioning them Herein was marked the most vital
difference between Mr and Mrs Vertrees and their big new neighbor
Sheridan though his youth was of the same epoch knew nothing of such
matters He had been chopping wood for the morning fire in the country
grocery while they were still dancing

It was after one oclock when Mrs Vertrees heard steps and the delicate
clinking of the key in the lock and then with the opening of the door
Marys laugh and Yesif you arent afraidtomorrow

The door closed and she rushed upstairs bringing with her a breath
of cold and bracing air into her mothers room Yes she said before
Mrs Vertrees could speak he brought me home

She let her cloak fall upon the bed and drawing an old redvelvet
rockingchair forward sat beside her mother after giving her a light
pat upon the shoulder and a hearty kiss upon the cheek

Mamma Mary exclaimed when Mrs Vertrees had expressed a hope that
she had enjoyed the evening and had not caught cold Why dont you ask
me

This inquiry obviously made her mother uncomfortable I dont she
faltered Ask you what Mary

How I got along and what hes like

Mary

Oh it isnt distressing said Mary And I got along so fast She
broke off to laugh continuing then But thats the way I went at it
of course We ARE in a hurry arent we

I dont know what you mean Mrs Vertrees insisted shaking her head
plaintively

Yes said Mary Im going out in his car with him tomorrow
afternoon and to the theater the next nightbut I stopped it there
You see after you give the first push you must leave it to them while
YOU pretend to run away

My dear I dont know what to

What to make of anything Mary finished for her So thats all
right Now Ill tell you all about it It was gorgeous and deafening and
teetotal We could have lived a year on it Im not good at figures
but I calculated that if we lived six months on poor old Charlie and Ned
and the stationwagon and the Victoria we could manage at least twice
as long on the cost of the housewarming I think the orchids alone
would have lasted us a couple of months There they were before me but
I couldnt steal em and sell em and sowell so I did what I could

She leaned back and laughed reassuringly to her troubled mother It
seemed to be a successwhat I could she said clasping her hands
behind her neck and stirring the rocker to motion as a rhythmic
accompaniment to her narrative The girl Edith and her sisterinlaw
Mrs Roscoe Sheridan were too anxious about the effect of things on me
The fathers worth a bushel of both of them if they knew it Hes
what he is I like him She paused reflectively continuing Ediths
interested in that Lamhorn boy hes goodlooking and not stupid but
I think hes She interrupted herself with a cheery outcry Oh I
mustnt be calling him names If hes trying to make Edith like him I
ought to respect him as a colleague

I dont understand a thing youre talking about Mrs Vertrees
complained

All the better Well hes a bad lot that Lamhorn boy everybodys
always known that but the Sheridans dont know the everybodies that
know He sat between Edith and Mrs Roscoe Sheridan SHES like those
people you wondered about at the theater the last time we wentdressed
in ballgowns bound to show their clothes and jewels SOMEwhere She
flatters the father and so did I for that matterbut not that way I
treated him outrageously

Mary

Thats what flattered him After dinner he made the whole regiment of
us follow him all over the house while he lectured like a guide on the
Palatine He gave dimensions and costs and the whole bilin of em
listened as if they thought he intended to make them a present of the
house What he was proudest of was the plumbing and that Bay of Naples
panorama in the hall He made us look at all the plumbingbathrooms
and everywhere elseand then he made us look at the Bay of Naples He
said it was a hundred and eleven feet long but I think its more And
he led us all into the readymade library to see a poem Edith had taken
a prize with at school Theyd had it printed in gold letters and framed
in motherofpearl But the poem itself was rather simple and wistful
and nicehe read it to us though Edith tried to stop him She was
modest about it and said shed never written anything else And then
after a while Mrs Roscoe Sheridan asked me to come across the street
to her house with themher husband and Edith and Mr Lamhorn and Jim
Sheridan

Mrs Vertrees was shocked Jim she exclaimed Mary PLEASE

Of course said Mary Ill make it as easy for you as I can
mamma Mr James Sheridan Junior We went over there and Mrs Roscoe
explained that the men were all dying for a drink though I noticed
that Mr Lamhorn was the only one near deaths door on that account
Edith and Mrs Roscoe said they knew Id been bored at the dinner They
were objectionably apologetic about it and they seemed to think NOW we
were going to have a good time to make up for it But I hadnt been
bored at the dinner Id been amused and the good time at Mrs
Roscoes was horribly horribly stupid

But Mary her mother began isis And she seemed unable to
complete the question

Never mind mamma Ill say it Is Mr James Sheridan Junior stupid
Im sure hes not at all stupid about business OtherwiseOh what
right have I to be calling people stupid because theyre not exactly
my kind On the big dinnertable they had enormous icing models of the
Sheridan Building

Oh no Mrs Vertrees cried Surely not

Yes and two other things of that kindI dont know what But after
all I wondered if they were so bad If Id been at a dinner at a palace
in Italy and a relief or inscription on one of the old silver pieces
had referred to some great deed or achievement of the family I
shouldnt have felt superior Id have thought it picturesque and
statelyId have been impressed And whats the real difference The
icing is temporary and thats much more modest isnt it And why is
it vulgar to feel important more on account of something youve done
yourself than because of something one of your ancestors did Besides
if we go back a few generations weve all got such hundreds of
ancestors it seems idiotic to go picking out one or two to be proud of
ourselves about Well then mamma I managed not to feel superior to
Mr James Sheridan Junior because he didnt see anything out of place
in the Sheridan Building in sugar

Mrs Vertreess expression had lost none of its anxiety pending the
conclusion of this lively bit of analysis and she shook her head
gravely My dear dear child she said it seems to meIt looksIm
afraid

Say as much of it as you can mamma said Mary encouragingly I can
get it if youll just give me one keyword

Everything you say Mrs Vertrees began timidly seems to have the
air ofit is as if you were seeking toto make yourself

Oh I see You mean I sound as if I were trying to force myself to like
him

Not exactly Mary That wasnt quite what I meant said Mrs Vertrees
speaking direct untruth with perfect unconsciousness But you said
thatthat you found the latter part of the evening at young Mrs
Sheridans unentertaining

And as Mr James Sheridan was there and I saw more of him than at
dinner and had a horribly stupid time in spite of that you think I
And then it was Mary who left the deduction unfinished

Mrs Vertrees nodded and though both the mother and the daughter
understood Mary felt it better to make the understanding definite

Well she asked gravely is there anything else I can do You and
papa dont want me to do anything that distresses me and so as this is
the only thing to be done it seems its up to me not to let it distress
me Thats all there is about it isnt it

But nothing MUST distress you the mother cried

Thats what I say said Mary cheerfully And so it doesnt Its all
right She rose and took her cloak over her arm as if to go to her own
room But on the way to the door she stopped and stood leaning against
the foot of the bed contemplating a threadbare rug at her feet
Mother youve told me a thousand times that it doesnt really matter
whom a girl marries

No no Mrs Vertrees protested I never said such a

No not in words I mean what you MEANT Its true isnt it that
marriage really is not a bed of roses but a field of battle To get
right down to it a girl could fight it out with anybody couldnt she
One man as well as another

Oh my dear Im sure your father and I

Yes yes said Mary indulgently I dont mean you and papa But
isnt it propinquity that makes marriages So many people say so there
must be something in it

Mary I cant bear for you to talk like that And Mrs Vertrees
lifted pleading eyes to her daughtereyes that begged to be spared It
soundsalmost reckless

Mary caught the appeal came to her and kissed her gaily Never fret
dear Im not likely to do anything I dont want to doIve always been
too thoroughgoing a little pig And if it IS propinquity that does our
choosing for us well at least no girl in the world could ask for more
than THAT How could there be any more propinquity than the very house
next door

She gave her mother a final kiss and went gaily all the way to the door
this time pausing for her postscript with her hand on the knob Oh
the one that caught me looking in the window mamma the youngest one

Did he speak of it Mrs Vertrees asked apprehensively

No He didnt speak at all that I saw to any one I didnt meet him
But he isnt insane Im sure or if he is he has long intervals when
hes not Mr James Sheridan mentioned that he lived at home when he was
well enough and it may be hes only an invalid He looks dreadfully
ill but he has pleasant eyes and it struck me that ifif one were
in the Sheridan familyshe laughed a little ruefullyhe might be
interesting to talk to sometimes when there was too much stocks and
bonds I didnt see him after dinner

There must be something wrong with him said Mrs Vertrees Theyd
have introduced him if there wasnt

I dont know Hes been ill so much and away so muchsometimes people
like that just dont seem to count in a family His father spoke of
sending him back to a machineshop or some sort I suppose he meant
when the poor thing gets better I glanced at him just then when Mr
Sheridan mentioned him and he happened to be looking straight at me
and he was patheticlooking enough before that but the most tragic
change came over him He seemed just to die right there at the table

You mean when his father spoke of sending him to the shop place

Yes

Mr Sheridan must be very unfeeling

No said Mary thoughtfully I dont think he is but he might be
uncomprehending and certainly hes the kind of man to do anything he
once sets out to do But I wish I hadnt been looking at that poor boy
just then Im afraid Ill keep remembering

I wouldnt Mrs Vertrees smiled faintly and in her smile there
was the remotest ghost of a genteel roguishness Id keep my mind on
pleasanter things Mary

Mary laughed and nodded Yes indeed Plenty pleasant enough and
probably if all were known too goodeven for me

And when she had gone Mrs Vertrees drew a long breath as if a burden
were off her mind and smiling began to undress in a gentle reverie



CHAPTER VIII

Edith glancing casually into the readymade library stopped
abruptly seeing Bibbs there alone He was standing before the
pearlframed and goldenlettered poem musingly inspecting it He read
it

 FUGITIVE

 I will forget the things that sting
 The lashing look the barbed word
 I know the very hands that fling
 The stones at me had never stirred
 To anger but for their own scars
 Theyve suffered so thats why they strike
 Ill keep my heart among the stars
 Where none shall hunt it out Oh like
 These wounded ones I must not be
 For wounded I might strike in turn
 So none shall hurt me Far and free
 Where my heart flies no one shall learn

Bibbs Ediths voice was angry and her color deepened suddenly as she
came into the room preceded by a scent of violets much more powerful
than that warranted by the actual bunch of them upon the lapel of her
coat

Bibbs did not turn his head but wagged it solemnly seeming depressed
by the poem Pretty young isnt it he said There must have been
something about your looks that got the prize Edith I cant believe
the poem did it

She glanced hurriedly over her shoulder and spoke sharply but in a
low voice I dont think its very nice of you to bring it up at all
Bibbs Id like a chance to forget the whole silly business I didnt
want them to frame it and I wish to goodness papad quit talking about
it but here that night after the dinner didnt he go and read it
aloud to the whole crowd of em And then they all wanted to know what
other poems Id written and why I didnt keep it up and write some more
and if I didnt why didnt I and why this and why that till I thought
Id die of shame

You could tell em you had writers cramp Bibbs suggested

I couldnt tell em anything I just choke with mortification every
time anybody speaks of the thing

Bibbs looked grieved The poem isnt THAT bad Edith You see you were
only seventeen when you wrote it

Oh hush up she snapped I wish it had burnt my fingers the first
time I touched it Then I might have had sense enough to leave it where
it was I had no business to take it and Ive been ashamed

No no he said comfortingly It was the very most flattering thing
ever happen to me It was almost my last flight before I went to the
machineshop and its pleasant to think somebody liked it enough to

But I DONT like it she exclaimed I dont even understand itand
papa made so much fuss over its getting the prize I just hate it The
truth is I never dreamed itd get the prize

Maybe they expected father to endow the school Bibbs murmured

Well I had to have something to turn in and I couldnt write a LINE
I hate poetry anyhow and Bobby Lamhorns always teasing me about how
I keep my heart among the stars He makes it seem such a mushy kind of
thing the way he says it I hate it

Youll have to live it down Edith Perhaps abroad and under another
name you might find

Oh hush up Ill hire some one to steal it and burn it the first
chance I get She turned away petulantly moving to the door Id like
to think I could hope to hear the last of it before I die

Edith he called as she went into the hall

Whats the matter

I want to ask you Do I really look better or have you just got used
to me

What on earth do you mean she said coming back as far as the
threshold

When I first came you couldnt look at me Bibbs explained in his
impersonal way But Ive noticed you look at me lately I wondered if
Id

Its because you look so much better she told him cheerfully This
month youve been heres done you no end of good Its the change

Yes thats what they said at the sanitariumthe change

You look worse than most anybody I ever saw said Edith with supreme
candor But I dont know much about it Ive never seen a corpse in my
life and Ive never even seen anybody that was terribly sick so you
mustnt judge by me I only know you do look better Im glad to say
But youre right about my not being able to look at you at first You
had a kind of whiteness thatWell youre almost as thin I suppose
but youve got more just ordinarily pale not that ghastly look Anybody
could look at you now Bibbs and nonot get

Sick

Wellalmost that she laughed And youre getting a better color
every day Bibbs you really are Youre getting along splendidly

IIm afraid so he said ruefully

Afraid so Well if you arent the queerest I suppose you mean
father might send you back to the machineshop if you get well enough
I heard him say something about it the night of the The jingle of
a distant bell interrupted her and she glanced at her watch Bobby
Lamhorn Im going to motor him out to look at a place in the country
Afternoon Bibbs

When she had gone Bibbs mooned pessimistically from shelf to shelf
his eye wandering among the titles of the books The library consisted
almost entirely of handsome uniform editions Irving Poe Cooper
Goldsmith Scott Byron Burns Longfellow Tennyson Hume Gibbon
Prescott Thackeray Dickens De Musset Balzac Gautier Flaubert
Goethe Schiller Dante and Tasso There were shelves and shelves
of encyclopedias of anthologies of famous classics of Oriental
masterpieces of masterpieces of oratory and more shelves of
selected libraries of literature of the drama and of modern
science They made an effective decoration for the room all these
big expensive books with a glossy binding here and there twinkling a
reflection of the flames that crackled in the splendid Gothic fireplace
but Bibbs had an impression that the bookseller who selected them
considered them a relief and that whitejacket considered them a
burden of dust and that nobody else considered them at all Himself he
disturbed not one

There came a chime of bells from a clock in another part of the house
and whitejacket appeared beamingly in the doorway bearing furs
Awready Mist Bibbs he announced You ma say wrap up wawm f you
ride an she cain go with you today an not fgit go see you pa at
fo clock Aw ready suh

He equipped Bibbs for the daily drive Dr Gurney had commanded and in
the manner of a master of ceremonies unctuously led the way In the
hall they passed the Moor and Bibbs paused before it while whitejacket
opened the door with a flourish and waved condescendingly to the
chauffeur in the car which stood waiting in the driveway

It seems to me I asked you what you thought about this statue when I
first came home George said Bibbs thoughtfully What did you tell
me

Yessuh George chuckled perfectly understanding that for some unknown
reason Bibbs enjoyed hearing him repeat his opinion of the Moor You
ast me when you firs come home an you ast me nex day an mighty
near evy day all time you been here an las Sunday you ast me
twicet He shook his head solemnly Look to me mus be somepm might
lamiDAL bout at statue

Mighty what

Mighty lamiDAL George burst out laughing What DO at word mean
Mist Bibbs

Its new to me George Where did you hear it

I nev DID hear it said George I uz dess sittin thinkum to mysef
an she pop in my headlamiDAL dess like at An she soun so good
seem like she GOTTA mean somepm

Come to think of it I believe she does mean something Why yes

Do she cried George WHAT she mean

Its exactly the word for the statue said Bibbs with conviction as
he climbed into the car Its a lamiDAL statue

Hiyi George exulted Man Man Listen Well suh she mighty lamiDAL
statue but lamiDAL statue heap o trouble to dus I expect she is
said Bibbs as the engine began to churn and a moment later he was
swept from sight

George turned to Mist Jackson who had been listening benevolently in
the hallway Same he awways say Mist JacksonI expec she is
Evy day he try t git me talk bout at lamiDAL statue an awways
las thing HE say I expec she is You know Mist Jackson if he git
well at young man go be pride o the family Mist Jackson Yessuh
right now I pick im fo firs money

Look out with all at money George Jackson warned the enthusiast
White folks n is house know im heap longern you You the ony man
bettin on im

I risk it cried George merrily I put her all on nowevy cent
At boys go be flower o the flock

This singular prophecy founded somewhat recklessly upon gratitude for
the meaning of lamiDAL differed radically from another prediction
concerning Bibbs set forth for the benefit of a fair auditor some
twenty minutes later

Jim Sheridan skirting the edges of the town with Mary Vertrees
beside him in his own swift machine encountered the invalid upon
the highroad The two cars were going in opposite directions and the
occupants of Jims had only a swaying glimpse of Bibbs sitting alone on
the back seathis white face startlingly white against cap and collar
of black furbut he flashed into recognition as Mary bowed to him

Jim waved his left hand carelessly Its Bibbs taking his
constitutional he explained

Yes I know said Mary I bowed to him too though Ive never met
him In fact Ive only seen him onceno twice I hope he wont think
Im very bold bowing to him

I doubt if he noticed it said honest Jim

Oh no she cried

Whats the trouble

Im almost sure people notice it when I bow to them

Oh I see said Jim Of course they would ordinarily but Bibbs is
funny

Is he How she asked He strikes me as anything but funny

Well Im his brother Jim said deprecatingly but I dont know what
hes like and to tell the truth Ive never felt exactly like I WAS
his brother the way I do Roscoe Bibbs never did seem more than half
alive to me Of course Roscoe and I are older and when we were boys we
were too big to play with him but he never played anyway with boys his
own age Hed rather just sit in the house and mope around by himself
Nobody could ever get him to DO anything you cant get him to do
anything now He never had any LIFE in him and honestly if he is my
brother I must say I believe Bibbs Sheridan is the laziest man God ever
made Father put him in the machineshop over at the Pump Worksbest
thing in the world for himand he was just plain no account It made
him sick If hed had the right kind of energythe kind fathers got
for instance or Roscoe eitherwhy it wouldnt have made him sick
And suppose it was either of themyes or me eitherdo you think any
of us would have stopped if we WERE sick Not much I hate to say it
but Bibbs Sheridanll never amount to anything as long as he lives

Mary looked thoughtful Is there any particular reason why he should
she asked

Good gracious he exclaimed You dont mean that do you Dont you
believe in a mans knowing how to earn his salt no matter how much
money his fathers got Hasnt the business of this world got to be
carried on by everybody in it Are we going to lay back on what weve
got and see other fellows get ahead of us If weve got big things
already isnt it every mans business to go ahead and make em bigger
Isnt it his duty Dont we always want to get bigger and bigger

YeesI dont know But I feel rather sorry for your brother He
looked so lonelyand sick

Hes gettin better every day Jim said Dr Gurney says so Theres
nothing much the matter with him reallyits ninetenths imaginary
Nerves People that are willing to be busy dont have nervous
diseases because they dont have time to imagine em

You mean his trouble is really mental

Oh hes not a lunatic said Jim Hes just queer Sometimes hell
say something right bright but half the time what he says is way off
the subject or else there isnt any sense to it at all For instance
the other day I heard him talkin to one of the darkies in the hall The
darky asked him what time he wanted the car for his drive and anybody
else in the world would have just said what time they DID want it and
that would have been all there was to it but heres what Bibbs says
and I heard him with my own ears What time do I want the car he
says Well now that dependsthat depends he says He talks slow
like that you know Ill tell you what time I want the car George
he says if youll tell ME what you think of this statue Thats
exactly his words Asked the darky what he thought of that Arab Edith
and mother bought for the hall

Mary pondered upon this He might have been in fun perhaps she
suggested

Askin a darky what he thought of a piece of statuaryof a work
of art Where on earth would be the fun of that No youre just
kindheartedand thats the way you OUGHT to be of course

Thank you Mr Sheridan she laughed

See here he cried Isnt there any way for us to get over this
Mister and Miss thing A months got thirtyone days in it Ive managed
to be with you a part of pretty near all the thirtyone and I think you
know how I feel by this time

She looked panicstricken immediately Oh no she protested quickly
No I dont and

Yes you do he said and his voice shook a little You couldnt help
knowing

But I do she denied hurriedly I do help knowing I meanOh
wait

What for You do know how I feel and youwell youve certainly
WANTED me to feel that wayor else pretended

Now now she lamented Youre spoiling such a cheerful afternoon

Spoilin it He slowed down the car and turned his face to her
squarely See here Miss Vertrees havent you

Stop Stop the car a minute And when he had complied she faced him as
squarely as he evidently desired her to face him Listen I dont want
you to go on today

Why not he asked sharply

I dont know

You mean its just a whim

I dont know she repeated Her voice was low and troubled and honest
and she kept her clear eyes upon his

Will you tell me something

Almost anything

Have you ever told any man you loved him

And at that though she laughed she looked a little contemptuous No
she said And I dont think I ever shall tell any man thator ever
know what it means Im in earnest Mr Sheridan

Then youyouve just been flirting with me Poor Jim looked both
furious and crestfallen

Not one bit she cried Not one word Not one syllable Ive meant
every single thing

I dont

Of course you dont she said Now Mr Sheridan I want you to start
the car Now Thank you Slowly till I finish what I have to say I
have not flirted with you I have deliberately courted you One thing
more and then I want you to take me straight home talking about the
weather all the way I said that I do not believe I shall ever care
for any man and that is true I doubt the existence of the kind of
caring we hear about in poems and plays and novels I think it must be
just a kind of emotional TALKmost of it At all events I dont feel
it Now we can go faster please

Just where does that let me out he demanded How does that excuse
you for

It isnt an excuse she said gently and gave him one final look
wholly desolate I havent said I should never marry

What Jim gasped

She inclined her head in a broken sort of acquiescence very humble
unfathomably sorrowful

I promise nothing she said faintly

You neednt shouted Jim radiant and exultant You neednt By
George I know youre square thats enough for me You wait and promise
whenever youre ready

Dont forget what I asked she begged him

Talk about the weather I will God bless the old weather cried the
happy Jim



CHAPTER IX

Through the open country Bibbs was borne flying between brown fields
and sunflecked groves of gray trees to breathe the rushing clean
air beneath a glorious skythat sky so despised in the city and so
maltreated there that from early October to midMay it was impossible
for men to remember that blue is the rightful color overhead

Upon each of Bibbss cheeks there was a hint of something almost
resembling a pinkishness not actual color but undeniably its phantom
How largely this apparition may have been the work of the wind upon his
face it is difficult to calculate for beyond a doubt it was partly the
result of a ladys bowing to him upon no more formal introduction than
the circumstance of his having caught her looking into his window a
month before She had bowed definitely she had bowed charmingly And it
seemed to Bibbs that she must have meant to convey her forgiveness

There had been something in her recognition of him unfamiliar to
his experience and he rode the warmer for it Nor did he lack the
impression that he would long remember her as he had just seen her her
veil tumultuously blowing back her face glowing in the windand that
look of gay friendliness tossed to him like a fresh rose in carnival

By and by upon a rising ground the driver halted the car then backed
and tacked and sent it forward again with its nose to the south and the
smoke Far before him Bibbs saw the great smudge upon the horizon
that nest of cloud in which the city strove and panted like an engine
shrouded in its own steam But to Bibbs who had now to go to the very
heart of it for a commanded interview with his father the distant
cloud was like an implacable genius issuing thunderously in smoke from
his enchanted bottle and irresistibly drawing Bibbs nearer and nearer

They passed from the farm lands and came in the amber light of
November late afternoon to the farthermost outskirts of the city and
here the sky shimmered upon the verge of change from blue to gray
the smoke did not visibly permeate the air but it was there
neverthelessimpalpable thin no more than the dust of smoke And
then as the car drove on the chimneys and stacks of factories came
swimming up into view like miles of steamers advancing abreast every
funnel with its vast plume savage and black sweeping to the horizon
dripping wealth and dirt and suffocation over league on league already
rich and vile with grime

The sky had become only a dingy thickening of the soiled air and a roar
and clangor of metals beat deafeningly on Bibbss ears And now the car
passed two great blocks of long brick buildings hideous in all ways
possible to make them hideous doorways showing dark one moment and
lurid the next with the leap of some virulent interior flame revealing
blackened giants half naked in passionate action struggling with
formless things in the hot illumination And big as these shops were
they were growing bigger spreading over a third block where two new
structures were mushrooming to completion in some hasty cement process
of a stability not overreassuring Bibbs pulled the rug closer about
him and not even the phantom of color was left upon his cheeks as he
passed this place for he knew it too well Across the face of one of
the buildings there was an enormous sign Sheridan Automatic Pump Co
Inc

Thence they went through streets of wooden houses all grimed and
adding their own grime from many a sooty chimney flimsey wooden houses
of a thousand flimsy whimsies in the fashioning built on narrow lots
and nudging one another crossly shutting out the stingy sunlight from
one another bad neighbors who would destroy one another root and branch
some night when the right wind blew They were only waiting for that
wind and a cigarette and then they would all be gone togethera pinch
of incense burned upon the tripod of the god

Along these streets there were skinny shadetrees and here and there
a forest elm or walnut had been left but these were dying Some people
said it was the scale some said it was the smoke and some were sure
that asphalt and improving the streets did it but Bigness was in
too Big a hurry to bother much about trees He had telegraphpoles
and telephonepoles and electriclightpoles and trolleypoles by the
thousand to take their places So he let the trees die and put up his
poles They were hideous but nobody minded that and sometimes the
wires fell and killed peoplebut not often enough to matter at all

Thence onward the car bore Bibbs through the older parts of the
town where the few solid old houses not already demolished were in
transition some with their fronts torn away were being made into
segments of apartmentbuildings others had gone uproariously into
trade brazenly putting forth showwindows on their first floors
seeming to mean it for a joke one or two with unaltered facades peeped
humorously over the tops of temporary office buildings of one story
erected in the old front yards Altogether the town here was like a
boardinghouse hash the Sunday after Thanksgiving the old ingredients
were discernible

This was the fringe of Bignesss own sanctuary and now Bibbs reached
the roaring holy of holies itself The car must stop at every crossing
while the darkgarbed crowds enveloped in maelstroms of dust hurried
before it Magnificent new buildings already dingy loomed hundreds of
feet above him newer ones more magnificent were rising beside them
rising higher old buildings were coming down middleaged buildings
were coming down the streets were laid open to their entrails and men
worked underground between palisades and overhead in metal cobwebs
like spiders in the sky Trolleycars and long interurban cars built to
split the wind like torpedoboats clanged and shrieked their way
round swarming corners motorcars of every kind and shape known to
man babbled frightful warnings and frantic demands hospital ambulances
clamored wildly for passage steamwhistles signaled the swinging of
titanic tentacle and claw riveters rattled like machineguns the
ground shook to the thunder of gigantic trucks and the conglomerate
sound of it all was the sound of earthquake playing accompaniments for
battle and sudden death On one of the new steel buildings no work
was being done that afternoon The building had killed a man in the
morningand the steelworkers always stop for the day when that
happens

And in the hurrying crowds swirling and sifting through the
brobdingnagian camp of iron and steel one saw the campfollowers and
the pagan womenthere would be work today and dancing tonight For
the Puritans dry voice is but the crackling of a leaf underfoot in the
rush and roar of the coming of the new Egypt

Bibbs was on time He knew it must be to the minute or his father
would consider it an outrage and the big chronometer in Sheridans
office marked four precisely when Bibbs walked in Coincidentally with
his entrance five people who had been at work in the office under
Sheridans direction walked out They departed upon no visible or
audible suggestion and with a promptness that seemed ominous to
the newcomer As the massive door clicked softly behind the elderly
stenographer the last of the procession Bibbs had a feeling that
they all understood that he was a failure as a great mans son a
disappointment the queer one of the family and that he had been
summoned to judgmenta wellfounded impression for that was exactly
what they understood

Sit down said Sheridan

It is frequently an advantage for deans schoolmasters and worried
fathers to place delinquents in the sittingposture Bibbs sat

Sheridan standing gazed enigmatically upon his son for a period of
silence then walked slowly to a window and stood looking out of it his
big hands loosely hooked together by the thumbs behind his back They
were soiled as were all other hands downtown except such as might be
still damp from a basin

Well Bibbs he said at last not altering his attitude do you know
what Im goin to do with you

Bibbs leaning back in his chair fixed his eyes contemplatively upon
the ceiling I heard you tell Jim he began in his slow way You
said youd send him to the machineshop with me if he didnt propose to
Miss Vertrees So I suppose that must be your plan for me But

But what said Sheridan irritably as the son paused

Isnt there somebody youd let ME propose to

That brought his father sharply round to face him You beat the devil
Bibbs what IS the matter with you Why cant you be like anybody else

Liver maybe said Bibbs gently

Boh Even ole Doc Gurney says theres nothin wrong with you
organically No Youre a dreamer Bibbs thats whats the matter
and thats ALL the matter Oh not one o these BIG dreamers that put
through the big deals No sir Youre the kind o dreamer that just
sets out on the back fence and thinks about how much trouble there must
be in the world That aint the kind that builds the bridges Bibbs
its the kind that borrows fifteen cents from his wifes uncles
brotherinlaw to get ten cents worth o plug tobacco and a nickels
worth o quinine

He put the finishing touch on this etching with a snort and turned
again to the window

Look out there he bade his son Look out o that window Look at the
life and energy down there I should think ANY young mans blood would
tingle to get into it and be part of it Look at the big things young
men are doin in this town He swung about coming to the mahogany desk
in the middle of the room Look at what I was doin at your age Look
at what your own brothers are doin Look at Roscoe Yes and look
at Jim I made Jim president o the Sheridan Realty Company last
NewYears with charge of every inch o ground and every brick and
every shingle and stick o wood we own and its an example to any young
manor ole man eitherthe way he took ahold of it Last July we found
out we wanted two more big warehouses at the Pump Workswanted em
quick Contractors said it couldnt be done said nine or ten months
at the soonest couldnt see it any other way Whatd Jim do Took the
contract himself found a fellow with a new cement and concrete process
kept men on the job night and day and stayed on it night and day
himselfand by George we begin to USE them warehouses next week Four
months and a half and every inch fireproof I tell you Jims one o
these fellers that make miracles happen Now I dont say every young
man can be like Jim because theres mighty few got his ability but
every young man can go in and do his share This town is Gods own
country and theres opportunity for anybody with a pound of energy and
an ounce o gumption I tell you these young business men I watch just
do my heart good THEY dont set around on the back fenceno sir They
take enough exercise to keep their health and they go to a baseball
game once or twice a week in summer maybe and theyre raisin nice
families with sons to take their places sometime and carry on the
workbecause the works got to go ON Theyre puttin their lifeblood
into it I tell you and thats why were gettin bigger every minute
and why THEYRE gettin bigger and why its all goin to keep ON
gettin bigger

He slapped the desk resoundingly with his open palm and then observing
that Bibbs remained in the same impassive attitude with his eyes still
fixed upon the ceiling in a contemplation somewhat plaintive Sheridan
was impelled to groan Oh Lord he said This is the way you always
were I dont believe you understood a darn word I been sayin You
dont LOOK as if you did By George its discouraging

I dont understand about gettingabout getting bigger said Bibbs
bringing his gaze down to look at his father placatively I dont see
just why

WHAT Sheridan leaned forward resting his hands upon the desk and
staring across it incredulously at his son

I dont understandexactlywhat you want it all bigger for

Great God shouted Sheridan and struck the desk a blow with his
clenched fist A son of mine asks me that You go out and ask the
poorest daylaborer you can find Ask him that question

I did once Bibbs interrupted when I was in the machineshop I

Whad he say

He said Oh hell answered Bibbs mildly

Yes I reckon he would Sheridan swung away from the desk I reckon
he certainly would And I got plenty sympathy with him right now
myself

Its the same answer then Bibbss voice was serious almost
tremulous

Damnation Sheridan roared Did you ever hear the word Prosperity
you ninny Did you ever hear the word Ambition Did you ever hear the
word PROGRESS

He flung himself into a chair after the outburst his big chest surging
his throat tumultuous with gutteral incoherences Now then he said
huskily when the anguish had somewhat abated what do you want to do

Sir

What do you WANT to do I said

Taken by surprise Bibbs stammered Whatwhat doIwhat

If Id let you do exactly what you had the whim for what would you
do

Bibbs looked startled then timidity overwhelmed hima profound
shyness He bent his head and fixed his lowered eyes upon the toe of his
shoe which he moved to and fro upon the rug like a culprit called to
the desk in school

What would you do Loaf

No sir Bibbss voice was almost inaudible and what little sound it
made was unquestionably a guilty sound I suppose IdId

Well

I suppose Id try toto write

Write what

Nothing importantjust poems and essays perhaps

That all

Yes sir

I see said his father breathing quickly with the restraint he was
putting upon himself That is you want to write but you dont want to
write anything of any account

You think

Sheridan got up again I take my hat off to the man that can write
a good ad he said emphatically The best writin talent in this
country is right spang in the ad business today You buy a magazine for
good writinlook on the back of it Let me tell you I pay money for
that kind o writin Maybe you think its easy Just try it Ive tried
it and I cant do it I tell you an ads got to be written so it makes
people do the hardest thing in this world to GET em to do its got to
make em give up their MONEY You talk about poems and essays I tell
you when it comes to the actual skill o puttin words together so as to
make things HAPPEN R T Bloss right here in this city knows more in
a minute than George Waldo Emerson ever knew in his whole life

Youyou may be Bibbs said indistinctly the last word smothered in
a cough

Of COURSE Im right And if it aint just like you to want to take up
with the most outodate kind o writin there is Poems and essays
My Lord Bibbs thats WOMENS work You cant pick up a newspaper
without havin to see where Mrs Rumskididle read a paper on Jane
Eyre or East Lynne at the GodKnowsWhat Club And poetry Why
look at Edith I expect that poem o hers would set a pretty highwater
mark for you young man and its the only one shes ever managed to
write in her whole LIFE When I wanted her to go on and write some more
she said it took too much time Said it took months and months And
Ediths a smart girl shes got more energy in her little finger than
you ever give me a chance to see in your whole body Bibbs Now look
at the facts say she could turn out four or five poems a year and you
could turn out maybe two That medal she got was worth about fifteen
dollars so theres your incomethirty dollars a year Thats a fine
success to make of your life Im not sayin a word against poetry I
wouldnt take ten thousand dollars right now for that poem of Ediths
and poetrys all right enough in its placebut you leave it to the
girls A mans got to do a mans work in this world

He seated himself in a chair at his sons side and leaning over tapped
Bibbs confidentially on the knee This citys got the greatest future
in America and if my sons behave right by me and by themselves theyre
goin to have a mighty fair share of ita mighty fair share I love
this town Its Gods own footstool and its made money for me every
day right along I dont know how many years I love it like I do my own
business and Id fight for it as quick as Id fight for my own family
Its a beautiful town Look at our wholesale district look at any
district you want to look at the park system were puttin through
and the boulevards and the public statuary And she grows God how she
grows He had become intensely grave he spoke with solemnity Now
Bibbs I cant take any of itnor any gold or silver nor buildings nor
bondsaway with me in my shroud when I have to go But I want to leave
my share in it to my boys Ive worked for it Ive been a builder and
a maker and two blades of grass have grown where one grew before
whenever I laid my hand on the ground and willed em to grow Ive built
big and I want the buildin to go on And when my last hour comes I
want to know that my boys are ready to take charge that theyre fit
to take charge and go ON with it Bibbs when that hour comes I want
to know that my boys are big men ready and fit to hold of big things
Bibbs when Im up above I want to know that the big share Ive made
mine here below is growin bigger and bigger in the charge of my
boys

He leaned back deeply moved There he said huskily Ive never
spoken more what was in my heart in my life I do it because I want you
to understandand not think me a mean father I never had to talk that
way to Jim and Roscoe They understood without any talk Bibbs

I see said Bibbs At least I think I do But

Wait a minute Sheridan raised his hand If you see the least bit
in the world then you understand how it feels to me to have my son set
here and talk about poems and essays and suchlike fooleries And you
must understand too what it meant to start one o my boys and have
him come back on me the way you did and have to be sent to a sanitarium
because he couldnt stand work Now lets get right down to it Bibbs
Ive had a whole lot o talk with ole Doc Gurney about you one time
another and I reckon I understand your case just about as well as he
does anyway Now here Ill be frank with you I started you in harder
than what I did the other boys and that was for your own good because
I saw you needed to be shook up moren they did You were always kind of
moody and mopishand you needed work thatd keep you on the jump Now
why did it make you sick instead of brace you up and make a man of you
the way it ought of done I pinned ole Gurney down to it I says Look
here aint it really because he just plain hated it Yes he says
thats it If hed enjoyed it it wouldnt a hurt him He loathes it
and that affects his nervous system The more he tries it the more he
hates it and the more he hates it the more injury it does him That
aint quite his words but its what he meant And thats about the way
it is

Yes said Bibbs thats about the way it is

Well then I reckon its up to me not only to make you do it but to
make you like it

Bibbs shivered And he turned upon his father a look that was almost
ghostly I cant he said in a low voice I cant

Cant go back to the shop

No Cant like it I cant

Sheridan jumped up his patience gone To his own view he had reasoned
exhaustively had explained fully and had pleaded more than a father
should only to be met in the end with the unreasoning and mysterious
stubbornness which had been Bibbss baffling characteristic from
childhood By George you will he cried Youll go back there and
youll like it Gurney says it wont hurt you if you like it and he
says itll kill you if you go back and hate it so it looks as if it
was about up to you not to hate it Well Gurneys a fool Hatin work
doesnt kill anybody and this isnt goin to kill you whether you hate
it or not Ive never made a mistake in a serious matter in my life
and it wasnt a mistake my sendin you there in the first place And
Im goin to prove itIm goin to send you back there and vindicate my
judgment Gurney says its all mental attitude Well youre goin
to learn the right one He says in a couple more months this fool thing
thats been the matter with youll be disappeared completely and youll
be back in as good or better condition than you were before you ever
went into the shop And right then is when you begin overright in that
same shop Nobody can call me a hard man or a mean father I do the best
I can for my chuldern and I take full responsibility for bringin my
sons up to be men Now so far Ive failed with you But Im not goin
to keep ON failin I never tackled a job YET I didnt put through and
Im not goin to begin with my own son Im goin to make a MAN of you
By God I am

Bibbs rose and went slowly to the door where he turned You say you
give me a couple of months he said

Sheridan pushed a bellbutton on his desk Gurney said two months more
would put you back where you were You go home and begin to get yourself
in the right mental attitude before those two months are up Goodby

Goodby sir said Bibbs meekly



CHAPTER X

Bibbss room that neat apartment for transients to which the lamidal
George had shown him upon his return still bore the appearance of
temporary quarters possibly because Bibbs had no clear conception
of himself as a permanent incumbent However he had set upon the
mantelpiece the two photographs that he owned one a group twenty
years oldhis father and mother with Jim and Roscoe as boysand the
other a cabinet of Edith at sixteen And upon a table were the books
he had taken from his trunk Sartor Resartus Virginibus Puerisque
Huckleberry Finn and Afterwhiles There were some other books in the
trunka large one which remained unremoved at the foot of the bed
adding to the general impression of transiency It contained nearly all
the possessions as well as the secret life of Bibbs Sheridan and Bibbs
sat beside it the day after his interview with his father raking over
a small collection of manuscripts in the top tray Some of these he
glanced through dubiously finding little comfort in them but one made
him smile Then he shook his head ruefully indeed and ruefully began to
read it It was written on paper stamped Hood Sanitarium and bore the
title Leisure

 A man may keep a quiet heart at seventy miles an hour but not if
 he is running the train Nor is the habit of contemplation a useful
 quality in the stoker of a foundry furnace it will not be found to
 recommend him to the approbation of his superiors For a profession
 adapted solely to the pursuit of happiness in thinking I would
 choose that of an invalid his money is time and he may spend it on
 Olympus It will not suffice to be an amateur invalid To my way
 of thinking the perfect practitioner must be to all outward
 purposes already dead if he is to begin the perfect enjoyment of
 life His serenity must not be disturbed by rumors of recovery he
 must lie serene in his long chair in the sunshine The world must
 be on the other side of the wall and the wall must be so thick and
 so high that he cannot hear the roaring of the furnace fires and the
 screaming of the whistles Peace

Having read so far as the word peace Bibbs suffered an interruption
interesting as a coincidence of contrast High voices sounded in the
hall just outside his door and it became evident that a womans quarrel
was in progress the parties to it having begun it in Ediths room and
continuing it vehemently as they came out into the hall

Yes you BETTER go home Bibbs heard his sister vociferating shrilly
You better go home and keep your mind a little more on your HUSBAND

Edie Edie he heard his mother remonstrating as peacemaker

You see here This was Sibyl and her voice was both acrid and
tremulous Dont you talk to me that way I came here to tell Mother
Sheridan what Id heard and to let her tell Father Sheridan if she
thought she ought to and I did it for your own good

Yes you did And Ediths gibing laughter tooted loudly Yes you
did YOU didnt have any other reason OH no YOU dont want to break it
up between Bobby Lamhorn and me because

Edie Edie Now now

Oh hush up mamma Id like to know then if she says her new friends
tell her hes got such a reputation that he oughtnt to come here what
about his not going to HER house How

Ive explained that to Mother Sheridan Sibyls voice indicated that
she was descending the stairs Married people are not the same Some
things that should be shielded from a young girl

This seemed to have no very soothing effect upon Edith Shielded from
a young girl she shrilled You seem pretty willing to be the shield
You look out Roscoe doesnt notice what kind of a shield you are

Sibyls answer was inaudible but Mrs Sheridans flurried attempts at
pacification were renewed Now Edie Edie she means it for your good
and youd oughtnt to

Oh hush up mamma and let me alone If you dare tell papa

Now now Im not going to tell him today and maybe

Youve got to promise NEVER to tell him the girl cried passionately

Well well see You just come back in your own room and well

No I WONT talk it over Stop pulling me Let me ALONE And Edith
flinging herself violently upon Bibbss door jerked it open swung
round it into the room slammed the door behind her and threw herself
face down upon the bed in such a riot of emotion that she had no
perception of Bibbss presence in the room Gasping and sobbing in a
passion of tears she beat the coverlet and pillows with her clenched
fists Sneak she babbled aloud Sneak Snakeinthegrass Cat

Bibbs saw that she did not know he was there and he went softly toward
the door hoping to get away before she became aware of him but some
sound of his movement reached her and she sat up startled facing him

Bibbs I thought I saw you go out awhile ago

Yes I came back though Im sorry

Did you hear me quarreling with Sibyl

Only what you said in the hall You lie down again Edith Im going
out

No dont go She applied a handkerchief to her eyes emitted a sob
and repeated her request Dont go I dont mind you youre quiet
anyhow Mammas so fussy and never gets anywhere I dont mind you at
all but I wish youd sit down

All right And he returned to his chair beside the trunk Go ahead
and cry all you want Edith he said No harm in that

Sibyl told mammaOH she began choking Mary Vertrees had mamma and
Sibyl and I to tea one afternoon two weeks or so ago and she had some
women there that Sibyls been crazy to get in with and she just laid
herself out to make a hit with em and shes been running after em
ever since and now she comes over here and says THEY say Bobby Lamhorn
is so bad that even though they like his family none of the nice
people in town would let him in their houses In the first place its
a falsehood and I dont believe a word of it and in the second place
I know the reason she did it and whats more she KNOWS I know it I
wont SAY what it isnot yetbecause papa and all of you would think
Im as crazy as she is snaky and Roscoes such a fool hed probably
quit speaking to me But its true Just you watch her thats all I
ask Just you watch that woman Youll see

As it happened Bibbs was literally watching that woman Glancing from
the window he saw Sibyl pause upon the pavement in front of the old
house next door She stood a moment in deep thought then walked
quickly up the path to the door undoubtedly with the intention
of calling But he did not mention this to his sister who after
delivering herself of a rather vague jeremiad upon the subject of her
sisterinlaws treacheries departed to her own chamber leaving him to
his speculations The chief of these concerned the social elasticities
of women Sibyl had just been a participant in a violent scene she had
suffered hot insult of a kind that could not fail to set her quivering
with resentment and yet she elected to betake herself to the presence
of people whom she knew no more than formally Bibbs marveled Surely
he reflected some traces of emotion must linger upon Sibyls face or in
her manner she could not have ironed it all quite out in the three or
four minutes it took her to reach the Vertreeses door

And in this he was not mistaken for Mary Vertrees was at that moment
wondering what internal excitement Mrs Roscoe Sheridan was striving to
master But Sibyl had no idea that she was allowing herself to exhibit
anything except the gaiety which she conceived proper to the manner of a
casual caller She was wholly intent upon fulfilling the sudden purpose
that brought her and she was no more selfconscious than she was finely
intelligent For Sibyl Sheridan belonged to a type Scriptural in its
antiquity She was merely the idle and halfeducated intriguer who may
and does delude men of course and the best and dullest of her own sex
as well finding invariably strong supporters among these latter It is
a type that has wrought some damage in the world and would have wrought
greater save for the check put upon its power by intelligent women
and by its own lack of perspective for it is a type that never sees
itself Sibyl followed her impulses with no reflection or questionit
was like a hound on the gallop after a master on horseback She had not
even the instinct to stop and consider her effect If she wished to make
a certain impression she believed that she made it She believed that
she was believed

My mother asked me to say that she was sorry she couldnt come down
Mary said when they were seated

Sibyl ran the scale of a cooing simulance of laughter which she had
been brought up to consider the polite thing to do after a remark
addressed to her by any person with whom she was not on familiar terms
It was intended partly as a courtesy and partly as the foundation for an
impression of sweetness

Just thought Id fly in a minute she said continuing the cooing to
relieve the last doubt of her gentiality I thought Id just behave
like REAL country neighbors We are almost out in the country so far
from downtown arent we And it seemed such a LOVELY day I wanted
to tell you how much I enjoyed meeting those nice people at tea that
afternoon You see coming here a bride and never having lived here
before Ive had to depend on my husbands friends almost entirely and
I reallyve known scarcely anybody Mr Sheridan has been so engrossed
in business ever since he was a mere boy why of course

She paused with the air of having completed an explanation

Of course said Mary sympathetically accepting it

Yes Ive been seeing quite a lot of the Kittersbys since that
afternoon Sibyl went on Theyre really delightful people Indeed
they are Yes

She stopped with unconscious abruptness her mind plainly wandering to
another matter and Mary perceived that she had come upon a definite
errand Moreover a tensing of Sibyls eyelids in that moment of
abstraction as she looked aside from her hostess indicated that the
errand was a serious one for the caller and easily to be connected
with the slight but perceptible agitation underlying her assumption of
cheerful ease There was a restlessness of breathing a restlessness of
hands

Mrs Kittersby and her daughter were chatting about some to the people
here in town the other day said Sibyl repeating the cooing and
protracting it They said something that took ME by surprise We were
talking about our mutual friend Mr Robert Lamhorn

Mary interrupted her promptly Do you mean mutual to include my
mother and me she asked

Why yes the Kittersbys and you and all of us Sheridans I mean

No said Mary We shouldnt consider Mr Robert Lamhorn a friend of
ours

To her surprise Sibyl nodded eagerly as if greatly pleased Thats
just the way Mrs Kittersby talked she cried with a vehemence that
made Mary stare Yes and I hear thats the way ALL you old families
here speak of him

Mary looked aside but otherwise she was able to maintain her composure
I had the impression he was a friend of yours she said adding
hastily and your husbands

Oh yes said the caller absently He is certainly A mans
reputation for a little gaiety oughtnt to make a great difference to
married people of course Its where young girls are in question THEN
it may be very very dangerous There are a great many things safe and
proper for married people that might be awfly imprudent for a young
girl Dont you agree Miss Vertrees

I dont know returned the frank Mary Do you mean that you intend
to remain a friend of Mr Lamhorns but disapprove of Miss Sheridans
doing so

Thats it exactly was the naive and ardent response of Sibyl What
I feel about it is that a man with his reputation isnt at all suitable
for Edith and the family ought to be made to understand it I tell
you she cried with a sudden access of vehemence her father ought to
put his foot down

Her eyes flashed with a green spark something seemed to leap out and
then retreat but not before Mary had caught a glimpse of it as one
might catch a glimpse of a thing darting forth and then scuttling back
into hiding under a bush

Of course said Sibyl much more composedly I hardly need say that
its entirely on Ediths account that Im worried about this Im as
fond of Edith as if she was really my sister and I cant help fretting
about it It would break my heart to have Ediths life spoiled

This tune was off the key to Marys ear Sibyl tried to sing with
pathos but she flatted

And when a lady receives a call from another who suffers under the
stress of some feeling which she wishes to conceal there is not
uncommonly developed a phenomenon of duality comparable to the effect
obtained by placing two mirrors opposite each other one clear and
the other flawed In this case particularly Sibyl had an imperfect
consciousness of Mary The Mary Vertrees that she saw was merely
something to be cozened to her own frantic purposea Mary Vertrees who
was incapable of penetrating that purpose Sibyl sat there believing
that she was projecting the image of herself that she desired to
project never dreaming that with every word every look and every
gesture she was more and more fully disclosing the pitiable truth to
the clear eyes of Mary And the Sibyl that Mary saw was an overdressed
woman in manner half rustic and in mind as shallow as a pan but
possessed by emotions that appeared to be strongperhaps even violent
What those emotions were Mary had not guessed but she began to suspect

And Ediths life WOULD be spoiled Sibyl continued It would be a
dreadful thing for the whole family Shes the very apple of Father
Sheridans eye and hes as proud of her as he is of Jim and Roscoe It
would be a horrible thing for him to have her marry a man like Robert
Lamhorn but he doesnt KNOW anything about him and if somebody doesnt
tell him what Im most afraid of is that Edith might get his consent
and hurry on the wedding before he finds out and then it would be too
late You see Miss Vertrees its very difficult for me to decide just
what its my duty to do

I see said Mary looking at her thoughtfully Does Miss Sheridan
seem toto care very much about him

Hes deliberately fascinated her returned the visitor beginning to
breathe quickly and heavily Oh she wasnt difficult She knew she
wasnt in right in this town and she was crazy to meet the people that
were and she thought he was one of em But that was only the start
that made it easy for himand he didnt need it He could have done
it anyway Sibyl was launched now her eyes were furious and her voice
shook He went after her deliberately the way he does everything hes
as coldblooded as a fish All he cares about is his own pleasure and
lately hes decided it would be pleasant to get hold of a piece of real
moneyand there was Edith And hell marry her Nothing on earth can
stop him unless he finds out she wont HAVE any money if she marries
him and the only person that could make him understand that is Father
Sheridan Somehow thats got to be managed because Lamhorn is going to
hurry it on as fast as he can He told me so last night He said he was
going to marry her the first minute he could persuade her to itand
little Ediths all ready to be persuaded Sibyls eyes flashed green
again And he swore hed do it she panted He swore hed marry Edith
Sheridan and nothing on earth could stop him

And then Mary understood Her lips parted and she stared at the babbling
creature incredulously a sudden vivid picture in her mind a canvas of
unconscious Sibyls painting Mary beheld it with pity and horror she
saw Sibyl clinging to Robert Lamhorn raging in a whisper perhapsfor
Roscoe might have been in the house or servants might have heard
She saw Sibyl entreating beseeching threatening despairingly and
Lamhorntired of herfirst evasive then brutally letting her have the
truth and at last infuriated swearing to marry her rival If Sibyl
had not babbled out the word swore it might have been less plain

The poor woman blundered on wholly unaware of what she had confessed
You see she said more quietly whatevers going to be done ought to
be done right away I went over and told Mother Sheridan what Id heard
about Lamhornoh I was open and aboveboard I told her right before
Edith I think it ought all to be done with perfect frankness because
nobody can say it isnt for the girls own good and what her best friend
would do But Mother Sheridans under Ediths thumb and shes afraid
to ever come right out with anything Father Sheridans different Edith
can get anything she wants out of him in the way of money or ordinary
indulgence but when it comes to a matter like this hed be a steel
rock If its a question of his will against anybody elses hed make
his will rule if it killed em both Now hed never in the world let
Lamhorn come near the house again if he knew his reputation So you
see somebodys got to tell him It isnt a very easy position for me
is it Miss Vertrees

No said Mary gravely

Well to be frank said Sibyl smiling thats why Ive come to you

To ME Mary frowned

Sibyl rippled and cooed again There isnt ANYBODY ever made such a hit
with Father Sheridan in his life as you have And of course we ALL
hope youre not going to be exactly an outsider in the affairs of the
family This sally with another and louder effect of laughter And
if its MY duty why in a way I think it might be thought yours too

No no exclaimed Mary sharply

Listen said Sibyl Now suppose I go to Father Sheridan with this
story and Edith says its not true suppose she says Lamhorn has a
good reputation and that Im repeating irresponsible gossip or suppose
whats most likely she loses her temper and says I invented it then
what am I going to do Father Sheridan doesnt know Mrs Kittersby and
her daughter and theyre out of the question anyway But suppose I
could say All right if you want proof ask Miss Vertrees She came
with me and shes waiting in the next room right now to

No no said Mary quickly You mustnt

Listen just a minute more Sibyl urged confidingly She was on easy
ground now to her own mind and had no doubt of her success You
naturally dont want to begin by taking part in a family quarrel but
if YOU take part in it it wont be one You dont know yourself what
weight you carry over there and no one would have the right to say you
did it except out of the purest kindness Dont you see that Jim and
his father would admire you all the more for it Miss Vertrees listen
Dont you see we OUGHT to do it you and I Do you suppose Robert
Lamhorn cares a snap of his finger for her Do you suppose a man like
him would LOOK at Edith Sheridan if it wasnt for the money And again
Sibyls emotion rose to the surface I tell you hes after nothing on
earth but to get his finger in that old mans moneypile over there
next door Hed marry ANYBODY to do it Marry Edith she cried I tell
you hed marry their nigger cook for THAT

She stopped afraidat the wrong timethat she had been too vehement
but a glance at Mary reassured her and Sibyl decided that she had
produced the effect she wished Mary was not looking at her she was
staring straight before her at the wall her eyes wide and shining She
became visibly a little paler as Sibyl looked at her

After nothing on earth but to get his finger in that old mans
moneypile over there next door The voice was vulgar the words were
vulgarand the plain truth was vulgar How it rang in Mary Vertreess
ears The clear mirror had caught its own image clearly in the flawed
one at last

Sibyl put forth her best bid to clench the matter She offered her
bargain Now dont you worry she said sunnily about this setting
Edith against you Shell get over it after a while anyway but if she
tried to be spiteful and make it uncomfortable for you when you drop in
over there or managed so as to sort of leave you out why Ive got a
house and Jim likes to come there I dont THINK Edith WOULD be that
way shes too crazy to have you take her around with the smart crowd
but if she DID you neednt worry And another thingI guess you wont
mind Jims own sisterinlaw speaking of it Of course I dont know
just how matters stand between you and Jim but Jim and Roscoe are about
as much alike as two brothers can be and Roscoe was very slow making up
his mind sometimes I used to think he actually never WOULD Now what
I mean is sistersinlaw can do lots of things to help matters on like
that Theres lots of little things can be said and lots

She stopped puzzled Mary Vertrees had gone from pale to scarlet and
now still scarlet indeed she rose without a word of explanation or
any other kind of word and walked slowly to the open door and out of
the room

Sibyl was a little taken aback She supposed Mary had remembered
something neglected and necessary for the instruction of a servant and
that she would return in a moment but it was rather a rude excess of
absentmindedness not to have excused herself especially as her guest
was talking And Marys return being delayed Sibyl found time to think
this unprefaced exit odder and ruder than she had first considered it
There might have been more excuse for it she thought had she been
speaking of matters less importantoffering to do the girl all the
kindness in her power too

Sibyl yawned and swung her muff impatiently she examined the sole of
her shoe she decided on a new shape of heel she made an inventory
of the furniture of the room of the rugs of the wallpaper and
engravings Then she looked at her watch and frowned went to a window
and stood looking out upon the brown lawn then came back to the chair
she had abandoned and sat again There was no sound in the house

A strange expression began imperceptibly to alter the planes of her
face and slowly she grew as scarlet as Maryscarlet to the ears She
looked at her watch againand twentyfive minutes had elapsed since she
had looked at it before

She went into the hall glanced over her shoulder oddly then she let
herself softly out of the front door and went across the street to her
own house

Roscoe met her upon the threshold gloomily Saw you from the window
he explained You must find a lot to say to that old lady

What old lady

Mrs Vertrees I been waiting for you a long time and I saw the
daughter come out fifteen minutes ago and post a letter and then walk
on up the street Dont stand out on the porch he said crossly
Come in here Theres something its come time Ill have to talk to you
about Come in

But as she was moving to obey he glanced across at his fathers house
and started He lifted his hand to shield his eyes from the setting sun
staring fixedly Somethings the matter over there he muttered and
then more loudly as alarm came into his voice he said Whats the
matter over there

Bibbs dashed out of the gate in an automobile set at its highest speed
and as he saw Roscoe he made a gesture singularly eloquent of calamity
and was lost at once in a cloud of dust down the street Edith had
followed part of the way down the drive and it could be seen that she
was crying bitterly She lifted both arms to Roscoe summoning him

By George gasped Roscoe I believe somebodys dead

And he started for the New House at a run



CHAPTER XI

Sheridan had decided to conclude his days work early that afternoon
and at about two oclock he left his office with a man of affairs from
foreign parts who had traveled far for a business conference with
Sheridan and his colleagues Herr Favre in spite of his French name
was a gentleman of Bavaria It was his first visit to our country and
Sheridan took pleasure in showing him the sights of the countrys finest
city They got into an open car at the main entrance of the Sheridan
Building and were driven first slowly and momentously through the
wholesale district and the retail district then more rapidly they
inspected the packinghouses and the stockyards then skirmished over
the park system and boulevards and after that whizzed through the
residence section on their way to the factories and foundries

All cray observed Herr Favre smilingly

Cray echoed Sheridan I dont know what you mean Cray

No white said Herr Favre with a wave of his hand toward the
long rows of houses on both sides of the street No white lace
windowcurtains all cray lace windowcurtains

Oh I see Sheridan laughed indulgently You mean GRAY No they
aint theyre white I never saw any gray ones

Herr Favre shook his head much amused There are NO white ones
he said There is no white ANYTHING in your city no white
windowcurtains no white house no white peeble He pointed upward
Smoke Then he sniffed the air and clasped his nose between forefinger
and thumb Smoke Smoke efrywhere Smoke in your insites He tapped
his chest Smoke in your lunks

Oh SMOKE Sheridan cried with gusto drawing in a deep breath and
patently finding it delicious You BET we got smoke

Exbensif said Herr Favre Ruins foliage ruins fabrics Maybe in
summer it iss not so bad but I wonder your wifes will bear it

Sheridan laughed uproariously They know it means new spring hats for
em

They must need many too said the visitor New hats new all things
but nothing white In Munchen we could not do it we are a safing
peeble

Wheres that

In Munchen You say Munich

Well I never been to Munich but I took in the Mediterranean trip
and I tell you outside o some right good scenery all I saw was mighty
dirty and mighty shiftless and mighty rundown at the heel Now comin
right down TO it Mr Farver wouldnt you rather live here in this town
than in Munich I know you got more enterprise up there than the part of
the old country I saw and I know YOURE a live business man and youre
associated with others like you but when it comes to LIVIN in a place
wouldnt you heap rather be here than over there

For me said Herr Favre no Here I should not think I was living It
would be like the miner who goes into the mine to work nothing else

We got a good many good citizens here from your part o the world THEY
like it

Oh yes And Herr Favre laughed deprecatingly The first generation
they bring their Germany with them then after that they are
Americans like you He tapped his hosts big knee genially You are
patriot so are they

Well I reckon you must be a pretty hot little patriot yourself Mr
Farver Sheridan exclaimed gaily You certainly stand up for your
own town if you stick to sayin youd rather live there than you would
here Yes SIR You sure are some patriot to say THATafter youve seen
our city It aint reasonable in you but I must say I kind of admire
you for it every man ought to stick up for his own even when he sees
the other fellows got the goods on him Yet I expect way down deep in
your heart Mr Farver youd rather live right here than any place else
in the world if you had your choice Man alive this is Gods country
Mr Farver and a blind man couldnt help seein it You couldnt stand
where you do in a business way and NOT see it Soho boy Here we are
This is the big works and Ill show you something now thatll make your
eyes stick out

They had arrived at the Pump Works and for an hour Mr Favre was
personally conducted and personally instructed by the founder and
president the buzzing queen bee of those buzzing hives

Now Ill take you for a spin in the country said Sheridan when at
last they came out to the car again Well take a breezer But with
his foot on the step he paused to hail a neat young man who came out
of the office smiling a greeting Hello young fellow Sheridan said
heartily On the job are you Jimmie Ha They dont catch you OFF of
it very often I guess though I do hear you go automobileridin in
the country sometimes with a mighty finelookin girl settin up beside
you He roared with laughter clapping his son upon the shoulder
Thats all right with meif it is with HER So Jimmie Well when we
goin to move into your new warehouses Monday

No cried his father delighted Dont tell me youre goin to keep
your word about dates Thats no way to do contractin Never heard of a
contractor yet didnt want more time

both of em now with Links and Sherman from foundation to roof I
guess theyll pass inspection too

Well then when you get through with that said his father you go
and take your girl out ridin By George youve earned it You tell
her you stand high with ME He stepped into the car waving a waggish
farewell and when the wheels were in motion again he turned upon his
companion a broad face literally shining with pride Thats my boy
Jimmie he said

Fine young man yes said Herr Favre

I got two o the finest boys said Sheridan I got two o the finest
boys God ever made and thats a fact Mr Farver Jims the oldest and
I tell you they got to get up the day before if they expect to catch HIM
in bed My other boy Roscoe hes always to the good too but Jims
a wizard You saw them two newprocess warehouses just about finished
Well JIM built em Ill tell you about that Mr Farver And he
recited this history describing the new process at length in fact he
had such pride in Jims achievement that he told Herr Favre all about it
more than once

Fine young man yes repeated the good Munchner threequarters of an
hour later They were many miles out in the open country by this time

He is that said Sheridan adding as if confidentially I got a fine
family Mr Farverfine chuldern I got a daughter now you take her
and put her anywhere you please and shell shine up with ANY of em
Theres culture and refinement and society in this town by the carload

the prettiest thing you ever saw Good size too good health and good
sense Jimll be just right if he gets her I must say it tickles ME
to think o the way that boy took ahold o that job back yonder Four
months and a half Yes sir

He expanded this theme once more and thus he continued to entertain
the stranger throughout the long drive Darkness had fallen before they
reached the city on their return and it was after five when Sheridan
allowed Herr Favre to descend at the door of his hotel where boys were
shrieking extra editions of the evening paper

Now good night Mr Farver said Sheridan leaning from the car to
shake hands with his guest Dont forget Im goin to come around and
take you up toGo on away boy

A newsboy had thrust himself almost between them yelling Extry
Secon Extry Extry all about the horrable acciDENT Extry

Get out laughed Sheridan Who wants to read about accidents Get
out

The boy moved away philosophically Extry Extry he shrilled Three
men killed Extry Millionaire killed Two other men killed Extry
Extry

Dont forget Mr Farver Sheridan completed his interrupted
farewells Ill come by to take you up to our house for dinner Ill be
here for you about halfpast five tomorrow afternoon Hope you njoyed
the drive much as I have Good nightgood night He leaned back
speaking to the chauffer Now you can take me around to the Central
City barbershop boy I want to get a shave fore I go up home

Extry Extry screamed the newsboys zigzagging among the crowds like
bats in the dusk Extry All about the horrable acciDENT Extry It
struck Sheridan that the papers sent out too many Extras they printed
Extras for all sorts of petty crimes and casualties It was a mistake
he decided critically Crying Wolf too often wouldnt sell the
goods it was bad business The papers would make more in the long
run he was sure if they published an Extra only when something of
real importance happened

Extry All about the horble AXnt Extry a boy squawked under his
nose as he descended from the car

Go on away said Sheridan gruffly though he smiled He liked to see
the youngsters working so noisily to get on in the world

But as he crossed the pavement to the brilliant glass doors of the
barbershop a second newsboy grasped the arm of the one who had thus
cried his wares

Say Yallern said this second hoarse with awe nt chew know who
that IS

Who

Its SHERIDAN

Jeest cried the first staring insanely

At about the same hour four times a weekMonday Wednesday Friday
and SaturdaySheridan stopped at this shop to be shaved by the head
barber The barbers were negroes he was their great man and it was
their habit to give him a reception his entrance being always the
signal for a flurry of jocular hospitality followed by general excesses
of briskness and gaiety But it was not so this evening

The shop was crowded Copies of the Extra were being read by men
waiting and by men in the latter stages of treatment Extras lay upon
vacant seats and showed from the pockets of hanging coats

There was a loud chatter between the practitioners and their recumbent
patients a vocal charivari which stopped abruptly as Sheridan opened
the door His name seemed to fizz in the air like the last sputtering
of a firework the barbers stopped shaving and clipping lathered men
turned their prostrate heads to stare and there was a moment of amazing
silence in the shop

The head barber nearest the door stood like a barber in a tableau His
left hand held stretched between thumb and forefinger an elastic section
of his helpless customers cheek while his right hand hung poised above
it the razor motionless And then roused from trance by the doors
closing he accepted the fact of Sheridans presence The barber
remembered that there are no circumstances in lifeor just after
itunder which a man does not need to be shaved

He stepped forward profoundly grave I be through with this man in the
chair one minute Mist Sheridan he said in a hushed tone Yessuh
And of a solemn negro youth who stood by gazing stupidly You goin
RESIGN he demanded in a fierce undertone You goin take Mist
Sheridans coat He sent an angry look round the shop and the barbers
taking his meaning averted their eyes and fell to work the murmur of
subdued conversation buzzing from chair to chair

You sit down ONE minute Mist Sheridan said the head barber gently
I fix nice chair fo you to wait in

Never mind said Sheridan Go on get through with your man

Yessuh And he went quickly back to his chair on tiptoe followed by
Sheridans puzzled gaze

Something had gone wrong in the shop evidently Sheridan did not know
what to make of it Ordinarily he would have shouted a hilarious demand
for the meaning of the mystery but an inexplicable silence had been
imposed upon him by the hush that fell upon his entrance and by the odd
look every man in the shop had bent upon him

Vaguely disquieted he walked to one of the seats in the rear of the
shop and looked up and down the two lines of barbers catching quickly
shifted furtive glances here and there He made this brief survey after
wondering if one of the barbers had died suddenly that day or the
night before but there was no vacancy in either line

The seat next to his was unoccupied but some one had left a copy of
the Extra there and frowning he picked it up and glanced at it The
first of the swollen display lines had little meaning to him

 Fatally Faulty New Process Roof Collapses Hurling Capitalist to
 Death with Inventor Seven Escape When Crash Comes Death Claims

Thus far had he read when a thin hand fell upon the paper covering the
print from his eyes and looking up he saw Bibbs standing before him
pale and gentle immeasurably compassionate

Ive come for you father said Bibbs Heres the boy with your coat
and hat Put them on and come home

And even then Sheridan did not understand So secure was he in the
strength and bigness of everything that was his he did not know what
calamity had befallen him But he was frightened

Without a word he followed Bibbs heavily out throught the still shop
but as they reached the pavement he stopped short and grasping his
sons sleeve with shaking fingers swung him round so that they stood
face to face

Whatwhat His mouth could not do him the service he asked of it he
was so frightened

Extry screamed a newsboy straight in his face Young North Side
millionaire insuntly killed Extry

NotJIM said Sheridan

Bibbs caught his fathers hand in his own

And YOU come to tell me that

Sheridan did not know what he said But in those first words and in the
first anguish of the big stricken face Bibbs understood the unuttered
cry of accusation

Why wasnt it you



CHAPTER XII

Standing in the black group under gaunt trees at the cemetery three
days later Bibbs unwillingly let an old old thought become definite
in his mind the sickly brother had buried the strong brother and Bibbs
wondered how many million times that had happened since men first made a
word to name the sons of one mother Almost literally he had buried his
strong brother for Sheridan had gone to pieces when he saw his dead
son He had nothing to help him meet the shock neither definite
religion nor philosophy definite or indefinite He could only beat his
forehead and beg over and over to be killed with an ax while his wife
was helpless except to entreat him not to take on herself adding a
continuous lamentation Edith weeping made truce with Sibyl and saw to
it that the mourning garments were beyond criticism Roscoe was dazed
and he shirked justifying himself curiously by saying he never had
any experience in such matters So it was Bibbs the shy outsider who
became during this dreadful little time the master of the house for
as strange a thing as that sometimes may be the result of a death He
met the relatives from out of town at the station he set the time
for the funeral and the time for meals he selected the flowers and
he selected Jims coffin he did all the grim things and all the other
things Jim had belonged to an order of Knights who lengthened the
rites with a picturesque ceremony of their own and at first Bibbs
wished to avoid this but upon reflection he offered no objectionhe
divined that the Knights and their service would be not precisely a
consolation but a satisfaction to his father So the Knights led the
procession with their band playing a dirge part of the long way to the
cemetery and then turned back after forming in two lines plumed
hats sympathetically in hand to let the hearse and the carriages pass
between

Mighty finelookin men said Sheridan brokenly They allall liked
him He was His breath caught in a sob and choked him He wasa
Grand Supreme Herald

Bibbs had divined aright

Dust to dust said the minister under the gaunt trees and at that
Sheridan shook convulsively from head to foot All of the black group
shivered except Bibbs when it came to Dust to dust Bibbs stood
passive for he was the only one of them who had known that thought as a
familiar neighbor he had been close upon dust himself for a long long
time and even now he could prophesy no protracted separation between
himself and dust The machineshop had brought him very close and if
he had to go back it would probably bring him closer still so closeas
Dr Gurney predictedthat no one would be able to tell the difference
between dust and himself And Sheridan if Bibbs read him truly would
be all the more determined to make a man of him now that there was
a man less in the family To Bibbss knowledge no one and nothing had
ever prevented his father from carrying through his plans once he had
determined upon them and Sheridan was incapable of believing that any
plan of his would not work out according to his calculations His nature
unfitted him to accept failure He had the gift of terrible persistence
and with unflecked confidence that his way was the only way he would
hold to that way of making a man of Bibbs who understood very well
in his passive and impersonal fashion that it was a way which might
make not a man but dust of him But he had no shudder for the thought

He had no shudder for that thought or for any other thought The
truth about Bibbs was in the poem which Edith had adopted he had so
thoroughly formed the oversensitive habit of hiding his feelings that
no doubt he had forgottenby this timewhere he had put some of them
especially those which concerned himself But he had not hidden his
feelings about his father where they could not be found He was strange
to his father but his father was not strange to him He knew that
Sheridans plans were conceived in the stubborn belief that they would
bring about a good thing for Bibbs himself and whatever the result was
to be the son had no bitterness Far otherwise for as he looked at the
big woeful figure shaking and tortured an almost unbearable pity laid
hands upon Bibbss throat Roscoe stood blinking his lip quivering
Edith wept audibly Mrs Sheridan leaned in half collapse against her
husband but Bibbs knew that his father was the one who cared

It was over Men in overalls stepped forward with their shovels and
Bibbs nodded quickly to Roscoe making a slight gesture toward the line
of waiting carriages Roscoe understoodBibbs would stay and see the
grave filled the rest were to go The groups began to move away over
the turf wheels creaked on the graveled drive and one by one the
carriages filled and departed the horses setting off at a walk Bibbs
gazed steadfastly at the workmen he knew that his father kept looking
back as he went toward the carriage and that was a thing he did not
want to see But after a little while there were no sounds of wheels
or hoofs on the gravel and Bibbs glancing up saw that every one had
gone A coupe had been left for him the driver dozing patiently

The workmen placed the flowers and wreaths upon the mound and about
it and Bibbs altered the position of one or two of these then stood
looking thoughtfully at the grotesque brilliancy of that festalseeming
hillock beneath the darkening November sky Its too bad he half
whispered his lips forming the wordsand his meaning was that it was
too bad that the strong brother had been the one to go For this was
his last thought before he walked to the coupe and saw Mary Vertrees
standing all alone on the other side of the drive

She had just emerged from a grove of leafless trees that grew on a
slope where the tombs were many and behind her rose a multitude of the
barbaric and classic shapes we so strangely strew about our graveyards
urncrowned columns and stonedraped obelisks shopcarved angels and
shopcarved children poising on pillars and shafts all liftingin
unthought pathostheir blind stoniness toward the sky Against such
a background Bibbs was not incongruous with his figure in black so
long and slender and his face so long and thin and white nor was the
undertakers coupe out of keeping with the shabby driver dozing on the
box and the shaggy horses standing patiently in attitudes without
hope and without regret But for Mary Vertrees here was a grotesque
settingshe was a vivid living creature of a beautiful world And a
graveyard is not the place for people to look charming

She also looked startled and confused but not more startled and
confused than Bibbs In Ediths poem he had declared his intention of
hiding his heart among the stars and in his boyhood one day he had
successfully hidden his body in the coalpile He had been no comrade
of other boys or of girls and his acquaintances of a recent period were
only a few fellowinvalids and the nurses at the Hood Sanitarium All
his life Bibbs had kept himself to himselfhe was but a shy onlooker in
the world Nevertheless the startled gaze he bent upon the
unexpected lady before him had causes other than his shyness and her
unexpectedness For Mary Vertrees had been a shining figure in the
little world of late given to the view of this humble and elusive
outsider and spectators sometimes find their hearts beating faster than
those of the actors in the spectacle Thus with Bibbs now He started
and stared he lifted his hat with incredible awkwardness his fingers
fumbling at his forehead before they found the brim

Mr Sheridan said Mary Im afraid youll have to take me home with
you I She stopped not lacking a momentary awkwardness of her own

Whywhyyes Bibbs stammered IllIll be deWont you get in

In that manner and in that place they exchanged their first words Then
Mary without more ado got into the coupe and Bibbs followed closing
the door

Youre very kind she said somewhat breathlessly I should have had
to walk and its beginning to get dark Its three miles I think

Yes said Bibbs Itit is beginning to get dark II noticed that

I ought to tell youI Mary began confusedly She bit her lip sat
silent a moment then spoke with composure It must seem odd my

No no Bibbs protested earnestly Not in thein the least

It does though said Mary I had not intended to come to the
cemetery Mr Sheridan but one of the men in charge at the house came
and whispered to me that the family wished me toI think your sister
sent him So I came But when we reached here Ioh I felt that perhaps
I

Bibbs nodded gravely Yes yes he murmured

I got out on the opposite side of the carriage she continued I mean
opposite fromfrom where all of you were And I wandered off over in
the other direction and I didnt realize how little time it takes
From where I was I couldnt see the carriages leavingat least I didnt
notice them So when I got back just now you were the only one here
I didnt know the other people in the carriage I came in and of course
they didnt think to wait for me Thats why

Yes said Bibbs I And that seemed all he had to say just then

Mary looked out through the dusty window I think wed better be going
home if you please she said

Yes Bibbs agreed not moving It will be dark before we get there

She gave him a quick little glance I think you must be very tired
Mr Sheridan and I know you have reason to be she said gently If
youll let me Ill And without explaining her purpose she opened the
door on her side of the coupe and leaned out

Bibbs started in blank perplexity not knowing what she meant to do

Driver she called in her clear voice loudly Driver Wed like to
start please Driver Stop at the house just north of Mr Sheridans
please The wheels began to move and she leaned back beside Bibbs
once more I noticed that he was asleep when we got in she said I
suppose they have a great deal of night work

Bibbs drew a long breath and waited till he could command his voice
Ive never been able to apologize quickly he said with his
accustomed slowness because if I try to I stammer My brother Roscoe
whipped me once when we were boys for stepping on his slatepencil
It took me so long to tell him it was an accident he finished before I
did

Mary Vertrees had never heard anything quite like the drawling gentle
voice or the odd implication that his not noticing the motionless state
of their vehicle was an accident She had formed a casual impression
of him not without sympathy but at once she discovered that he was
unlike any of her cursory and vague imaginings of him And suddenly she
saw a picture he had not intended to paint for sympathy a sturdy boy
hammering a smaller sickly boy and the sickly boy unresentful Not
that picture alone others flashed before her Instantaneously she had a
glimpse of Bibbss life and into his life She had a queer feeling new
to her experience of knowing him instantly It startled her a little
and then with some surprise she realized that she was glad he had sat
so long after getting into the coupe before he noticed that it had
not started What she did not realize however was that she had made
no response to his apology and they passed out of the cemetery gates
neither having spoken again

Bibbs was so content with the silence he did not know that it was
silence The dusk gathering in their small inclosure was filled with a
rich presence for him and presently it was so dark that neither of the
two could see the other nor did even their garments touch But neither
had any sense of being alone The wheels creaked steadily rumbling
presently on paved streets there were the sounds as from a distance
of the plodplod of the horses and sometimes the driver became audible
coughing asthmatically or saying You JOE with a spiritless flap of
the whip upon an unresponsive back Oblongs of light from the lamps
at streetcorners came swimming into the interior of the coupe and
thinning rapidly to lances passed utterly leaving greater darkness
And yet neither of these two last attendants at Jim Sheridans funeral
broke the silence

It was Mary who preceived the strangeness of ittoo late Abruptly she
realized that for an indefinite interval she had been thinking of her
companion and not talking to him Mr Sheridan she began not knowing
what she was going to say but impelled to say anything as she realized
the queerness of this driveMr Sheridan I

The coupe stopped You JOE said the driver reproachfully and
climbed down and opened the door

Whats the trouble Bibbs inquired

Lady said stop at the first house north of Mr Sheridans sir

Mary was incredulous she felt that it couldnt be true and that it
mustnt be true that they had driven all the way without speaking

What Bibbs demanded

Were there sir said the driver sympathetically Next house north
of Mr Sheridans

Bibbs descended to the curb Why yes he said Yes you seem to
be right And while he stood staring at the dimly illuminated front
windows of Mr Vertreess house Mary got out unassisted

Let me help you said Bibbs stepping toward her mechanically and she
was several feet from the coupe when he spoke

Oh no she murmured I think I can She meant that she could get
out of the coupe without help but perceiving that she had already
accomplished this feat she decided not to complete the sentence

You JOE cried the driver angrily climbing to his box And he
rumbled away at his teams best pacea snails

Thank you for bringing me home Mr Sheridan said Mary stiffly She
did not offer her hand Good night

Good night Bibbs said in response and turning with her walked
beside her to the door Mary made that a short walk she almost ran
Realization of the queerness of their drive was growing upon her
beginning to shock her she stepped aside from the light that fell
through the glass panels of the door and withheld her hand as it touched
the oldfashioned bellhandle

Im quite safe thank you she said with a little emphasis Good
night

Good night said Bibbs and went obediently When he reached the
street he looked back but she had vanished within the house

Moving slowly away he caromed against two people who were turning out
from the pavement to cross the street They were Roscoe and his wife

Where are your eyes Bibbs demanded Roscoe Sleepwalking as
usual

But Sibyl took the wanderer by the arm Come over to our house for a
little while Bibbs she urged I want to

No Id better

Yes I want you to Your fathers gone to bed and theyre all quiet
over thereall worn out Just come for a minute

He yielded and when they were in the house she repeated herself with
real feeling All worn out Well if anybody is YOU are Bibbs And
I dont wonder youve done every bit of the work of it You mustnt get
down sick again Im going to make you take a little brandy

He let her have her own way following her into the diningroom and
was grateful when she brought him a tiny glass filled from one of the
decanters on the sideboard Roscoe gloomily poured for himself a much
heavier libation in a larger glass and the two men sat while Sibyl
leaned against the sideboard reviewing the episodes of the day and
recalling the names of the donors of flowers and wreaths She pressed
Bibbs to remain longer when he rose to go and then as he persisted
she went with him to the front door He opened it and she said

Bibbs you were coming out of the Vertreeses house when we met you
How did you happen to be there

I had only been to the door he said Good night Sibyl

Wait she insisted We saw you coming out

I wasnt he explained moving to depart Id just brought Miss
Vertrees home

What she cried

Yes he said and stepped out upon the porch that was it Good
night Sibyl

Wait she said following him across the threshold How did that
happen I thought you were going to wait while those men filled
thethe She paused but moved nearer him insistently

I did wait Miss Vertrees was there he said reluctantly She
had walked away for a while and didnt notice that the carriages were
leaving When she came back the coupe waiting for me was the only one
left

Sibyl regarded him with dilating eyes She spoke with a slow
breathlessness And she drove home from Jims funeralwith you

Without warning she burst into laughter clapped her hand ineffectually
over her mouth and ran back uproariously into the house hurling the
door shut behind her



CHAPTER XIII

Bibbs went home pondering He did not understand why Sibyl had laughed
The laughter itself had been spontaneous and beyond suspicion but it
seemed to him that she had only affected the effort to suppress it and
that she wished it to be significant Significant of what And why had
she wished to impress upon him the fact of her overwhelming amusement
He found no answer but she had succeeded in disturbing him and he
wished that he had not encountered her

At home uncles aunts and cousins from out of town were wandering
about the house several mournfully admiring the Bay of Naples and
others occupied with the Moor and the plumbing while they waited for
trains Edith and her mother had retired to some upper fastness but
Bibbs interviewed Jackson and had the various groups of relatives
summoned to the diningroom for food One greatuncle old Gideon
Sheridan from Boonville could not be found and Bibbs went in search of
him He ransacked the house discovering the missing antique at last
by accident Passing his fathers closed door on tiptoe Bibbs heard
a murmurous sound and paused to listen The sound proved to be a
quavering and rickety voice monotonously bleating

The Loord givuth and the Loord takuth away We got to remember that
we got to remember that Im agittin along James Im agittin
along and Ive seen amany of em gotwo daughters and a son the Lord
give me and He has taken all away For the Loord givuth and the Loord
takuth away Remember the words of Bildad the Shuhite James Bildad the
Shuhite says He shall have neither son nor nephew among his people
nor any remaining in his dwellings Bildad the Shuhite

Bibbs opened the door softly His father was lying upon the bed in
his underclothes face downward and Uncle Gideon sat near by swinging
backward and forward in a rockingchair stroking his long white beard
and gazing at the ceiling as he talked Bibbs beckoned him urgently but
Uncle Gideon paid no attention

Bildad the Shuhite spake and his says If thy children have sinned
against Him and He have cast them away

There was a muffled explosion beneath the floor and the windows
rattled The figure lying face downward on the bed did not move but
Uncle Gideon leaped from his chair My God he cried Whats that

There came a second explosion and Uncle Gideon ran out into the hall
Bibbs went to the head of the great staircase and looking down
discovered the source of the disturbance Gideons grandson a boy
of fourteen had brought his camera to the funeral and was taking
flashlights of the Moor Uncle Gideon reassured by Bibbss
explanation would have returned to finish his quotation from Bildad the
Shuhite but Bibbs detained him and after a little argument persuaded
him to descend to the diningroom whither Bibbs followed after closing
the door of his fathers room

He kept his eye on Gideon after dinner diplomatically preventing
several attempts on the part of that comforter to reascend the stairs
and it was a relief to Bibbs when George announced that an automobile
was waiting to convey the ancient man and his grandson to their train
They were the last to leave and when they had gone Bibbs went sighing
to his own room

He stretched himself wearily upon the bed but presently rose went to
the window and looked for a long time at the darkened house where
Mary Vertrees lived Then he opened his trunk took therefrom a small
notebook half filled with fragmentary scribblings and began to write

 Laughter after a funeral In this reaction people will laugh at
 anything and at nothing The band plays a dirge on the way to the
 cemetery but when it turns back and the mourning carriages are
 out of hearing it strikes up Darktown is Out Tonight That
 is naturalbut there are women whose laughter is like the whirring
 of whips Why is it that certain kinds of laughter seem to spoil
 something hidden away from the laughers If they do not know of
 it and have never seen it how can their laughter hurt it Yet it
 does Beauty is not out of place among gravestones It is not
 out of place anywhere But a woman who has been betrothed to a
 man would not look beautiful at his funeral A woman might look
 beautiful though at the funeral of a man whom she had known and
 liked And in that case too she would probably not want to talk
 if she drove home from the cemetery with his brother nor would
 she want the brother to talk Silence is usually either stupid or
 timid But for a man who stammers if he tries to talk fast and
 drawls so slowly when he doesnt stammer that nobody has time to
 listen to him silence is advisable Nevertheless too much silence
 is open to suspicion It may be reticence or it may be a vacuum
 It may be dignity or it may be false teeth

 Sometimes an imperceptible odor will become perceptible in a small
 inclosure such as a closed carriage The ghost of gasoline rising
 from a ladys glove might be sweeter to the man riding beside her
 than all the scents of Arcady in spring It depends on the lady
 but there ARE Three miles may be three hundred miles or it may
 be three feet When it is three feet you have not time to say a
 great deal before you reach the end of it Still it may be that
 one should begin to speak

 No one could help wishing to stay in a world that holds some of
 the people that are in this world There are some so wonderful
 you do not understand how the dead COULD die How could they let
 themselves A falling building does not care who falls with it
 It does not choose who shall be upon its roof and who shall not
 Silence CAN be golden Yes But perhaps if a woman of the world
 should find herself by accident sitting beside a man for the length
 of time it must necessarily take two slow old horses to jog three
 miles she might expect that man to say something of some sort
 Even if she thought him a feeble hypochondriac even if she had
 heard from others that he was a disappointment to his own people
 even if she had seen for herself that he was a useless and
 irritating encumbrance everywhere she might expect him at least
 to speakshe might expect him to open his mouth and try to make
 sounds if he only barked If he did not even try but sat every
 step of the way as dumb as a frozen fish she might THINK him a
 frozen fish And she might be right She might be right if she
 thought him about as pleasant a companion asas Bildad the Shuhite

Bibbs closed his notebook replacing it in his trunk Then after a
period of melancholy contemplation he undressed put on a dressinggown
and slippers and went softly out into the hallto his fathers door
Upon the floor was a tray which Bibbs had sent George earlier in the
evening to place upon a table in Sheridans roombut the food was
untouched Bibbs stood listening outside the door for several minutes
There came no sound from within and he went back to his own room and to
bed

In the morning he woke to a state of being hitherto unknown in his
experience Sometimes in the process of waking there is a little
pausesleep has gone but coherent thought has not begun It is
a curious halfvoid a glimpse of aphasia and although the person
experiencing it may not know for that instant his own name or age or
sex he may be acutely conscious of depression or elation It is the
moment as we say before we remember and for the first time in
Bibbss life it came to him bringing a vague happiness He woke to a
sense of new riches he had the feeling of a boy waking to a birthday
But when the next moment brought him his memory he found nothing that
could explain his exhilaration On the contrary under the circumstances
it seemed grotesquely unwarranted However it was a brief visitation
and was gone before he had finished dressing It left a little trail
the pleased recollection of it and the puzzle of it which remained
unsolved And in fact waking happily in the morning is not usually
the result of a drive home from a funeral No wonder the sequence evaded
Bibbs Sheridan

His father had gone when he came downstairs Went on down to s
office jes same Jackson informed him Came sat breakfastable all
by mself eat nothin George bring nice breakfas but he din eat
a thing Yessuh went on downtown jes same he yoosta do Yessuh I
reckon putty much evything goin go on same as it yoosta do

It struck Bibbs that Jackson was right The day passed as other days had
passed Mrs Sheridan and Edith were in black and Mrs Sheridan cried
a little now and then but no other external difference was to be
seen Edith was quiet but not noticeably depressed and at lunch proved
herself able to argue with her mother upon the propriety of receiving
calls in the earliest stages of mourning Lunch was as usualfor Jim
and his father had always lunched downtownand the afternoon was as
usual Bibbs went for his drive and his mother went with him as she
sometimes did when the weather was pleasant Altogether the usualness
of things was rather startling to Bibbs

During the drive Mrs Sheridan talked fragmentarily of Jims childhood
But you wouldnt remember about that she said after narrating an
episode You were too little He was always a good boy just like that
And hed save whatever papa gave him and put it in the bank I reckon
itll just about kill your father to put somebody in his place as
president of the Realty Company Bibbs I know he cant move Roscoe
over he told me last week hed already put as much on Roscoe as any
one man could handle and not go crazy Oh its a pity She stopped
to wipe her eyes Its a pity you didnt run more with Jim Bibbs and
kind o pick up his ways Think what itd meant to papa now You never
did run with either Roscoe or Jim any even before you got sick Of
course you were younger but it always DID seem queerand you three
bein brothers like that I dont believe I ever saw you and Jim sit
down together for a good talk in my life

Mother Ive been away so long Bibbs returned gently And since I
came home I

Oh I aint reproachin you Bibbs she said Jim aint been home
much of an evening since you got backwhat with his work and callin
and goin to the theater and places and often not even at the house for
dinner Right the evening before he got hurt he had his dinner at some
miserble restrant down by the Pump Works he was so set on overseein
the night work and gettin everything finished up right to the minute he
told papa he would I reckon you might a put in more time with Jim if
thered been more opportunity Bibbs I expect you feel almost as if you
scarcely really knew him right well

I suppose I really didnt mother He was busy you see and I hadnt
much to say about the things that interested him because I dont know
much about them

Its a pity Oh its a pity she moaned And youll have to learn to
know about em NOW Bibbs I havent said much to you because I felt it
was all between your father and you but I honestly do believe it will
just kill him if he has to have any more trouble on top of all this
You mustnt LET him Bibbsyou mustnt You dont know how hes grieved
over you and now he cant stand any morehe just cant Whatever he
says for you to do you DO it Bibbs you DO it I want you to promise
me you will

I would if I could he said sorrowfully

No no Why cant you she cried clutching his arm He wants you to
go back to the machineshop and

Andlike it said Bibbs

Yes thats itto go in a cheerful spirit Dr Gurney said it wouldnt
hurt you if you went in a cheerful spiritthe doctor said that himself
Bibbs So why cant you do it Cant you do that much for your father
You ought to think what hes done for YOU You got a beautiful house
to live in you got automobiles to ride in you got fur coats and warm
clothes you been taken care of all your life And you dont KNOW how
he worked for the money to give all these things to you You dont DREAM
what he had to go through and what he risked when we were startin out
in life and you never WILL know And now this blow has fallen on him
out of a clear sky and you make it out to be a hardship to do like he
wants you to And all on earth he asks is for you to go back to the work
in a cheerful spirit so it wont hurt you Thats all he asks Look
Bibbs were gettin back near home but before we get there I want you
to promise me that youll do what he asks you to Promise me

In her earnestness she cleared away her black veil that she might see
him better and it blew out on the smoky wind He readjusted it for her
before he spoke

Ill go back in as cheerful a spirit as I can mother he said

There she exclaimed satisfied Thats a good boy Thats all I
wanted you to say

Dont give me any credit he said ruefully There isnt anything
else for me to do

Now dont begin talkin THAT way

No no he soothed her Well have to begin to make the spirit a
cheerful one We may They were turning into their own driveway as
he spoke and he glanced at the old house next door Mary Vertrees was
visible in the twilight standing upon the front steps bareheaded the
door open behind her She bowed gravely

We maywhat asked Mrs Sheridan with a slight impatience

What is it mother

You said We may and didnt finish what you were sayin

Did I said Bibbs blankly Well what WERE we saying

Of all the queer boys she cried You always were Always You
havent forgot what you just promised me have you

No he answered as the car stopped No the spirit will be as
cheerful as the flesh will let it mother It wont do to behave like

His voice was low and in her movement to descend from the car she
failed to here his final words

Behave like who Bibbs

Nothing

But she was fretful in her grief You said it wouldnt do to behave
like SOMEBODY Behave like WHO

It was just nonsense he explained turning to go in An obscure
person I dont think much of lately

Behave like WHO she repeated and upon his yielding to her petulant
insistence she made up her mind that the only thing to do was to tell
Dr Gurney about it

Like Bildad the Shuhite was what Bibbs said



CHAPTER XIV

The outward usualness of things continued after dinner It was
Sheridans custom to read the evening paper beside the fire in the
library while his wife sitting near by either sewed from old habit
or allowed herself to be repeatedly baffled by one of the simpler forms
of solitaire Tonight she did neither but sat in her customary chair
gazing at the fire while Sheridan let the unfolded paper rest upon his
lap though now and then he lifted it as if to read and let it fall
back upon his knees again Bibbs came in noiselessly and sat in a
corner doing nothing and from a receptionroom across the hall an
indistinct vocal murmur became just audible at intervals Once when
this murmur grew louder under stress of some irrepressible merriment
Ediths voice could be heardBobby arent you awful and Sheridan
glanced across at his wife appealingly

She rose at once and went into the receptionroom there was a flurry
of whispering and the sound of tiptoeing in the hallEdith and her
suitor changing quarters to a more distant room Mrs Sheridan returned
to her chair in the library

They wont bother you any more papa she said in a comforting voice
She told me at lunch hed phoned he wanted to come up this evening
and I said I thought hed better wait a few days but she said shed
already told him he could She paused then added rather guiltily I
got kind of a notion maybe Roscoe dont like him as much as he used
to Maybemaybe you better ask Roscoe papa And as Sheridan nodded
solemnly she concluded in haste Dont say I said to I might be
wrong about it anyway

He nodded again and they sat for some time in a silence which Mrs
Sheridan broke with a little sniff having fallen into a reverie that
brought tears That Miss Vertrees was a good girl she said SHE was
all right

Her husband evidently had no difficulty in following her train of
thought for he nodded once more affirmatively

Did youHow did you fix it about thethe Realty Company she
faltered Did you

He rose heavily helping himself to his feet by the arms of his chair
I fixed it he said in a husky voice I moved Cantwell up and put
Johnston in Cantwells place and split up Johnstons work among the
four men with salaries high enough to take it He went to her put
his hand upon her shoulder and drew a long audible tremulous breath
Its my bedtime mamma Im goin up He dropped the hand from her
shoulder and moved slowly away but when he reached the door he stopped
and spoke again without turning to look at her The Realty Companyll
go right on just the same he said Its likeits like sand mamma
It puts me in mind of chuldern playin in a sandpile One of em sticks
his finger in the sand and makes a hole and another of emll pat the
place with his hand and all the little grains of sand run in and fill
it up and settle against one another and then right away its flat on
top again and you cant tell there ever was a hole there The Realty
Companyll go on all right mamma There aint anything anywhere I
reckon that wouldnt go right onjust the same

And he passed out slowly into the hall then they heard his heavy tread
upon the stairs

Mrs Sheridan rising to follow him turned a piteous face to her son
Its so forlone she said chokingly Thats the first time he spoke
since he came in the house this evening I know it must a hurt him to
hear Edith laughin with that Lamhorn Shed oughtnt to let him come
right the very first evening this way shed oughtnt to done it She
just seems to lose her head over him and it scares me You heard what
Sibyl said the other day andand you heard whatwhat

What Edith said to Sibyl Bibbs finished the sentence for her

We CANT have any trouble o THAT kind she wailed Oh it looks as
if movin up to this New House had brought us awful bad luck It scares
me She put both her hands over her face Oh Bibbs Bibbs if you
only wasnt so QUEER If you could only been a kind of dependable son
I dont know what were all comin to And weeping she followed her
husband

Bibbs gazed for a while at the fire then he rose abruptly like a man
who has come to a decision and briskly sought the roomit was called
the smokingroomwhere Edith sat with Mr Lamhorn They looked up in
no welcoming manner at Bibbss entrance and moved their chairs to a
less conspicuous adjacency

Good evening said Bibbs pleasantly and he seated himself in a
leather easychair near them

What is it asked Edith plainly astonished

Nothing he returned smiling

She frowned Did you want something she asked

Nothing in the world Father and mother have gone upstairs I shant
be going up for several hours and there didnt seem to be anybody left
for me to chat with except you and Mr Lamhorn

CHAT with she echoed incredulously

I can talk about almost anything said Bibbs with an air of
genial politeness It doesnt matter to ME I dont know much about
businessif thats what you happened to be talking about But you
arent in business are you Mr Lamhorn

Not now returned Lamhorn shortly

Im not either said Bibbs It was getting cloudier than usual I
noticed just before dark and there was wind from the southwest Rain
tomorrow I shouldnt be surprised

He seemed to feel that he had begun a conversation the support of
which had now become the pleasurable duty of other parties and he
sat expectantly looking first at his sister then at Lamhorn as if
implying that it was their turn to speak Edith returned his gaze with
a mixture of astonishment and increasing anger while Mr Lamhorn was
obviously disturbed though Bibbs had been as considerate as possible in
presenting the weather as a topic Bibbs had perceived that Lamhorn had
nothing in his mind at any time except personalitieshe could talk
about people and he could make love Bibbs wishing to be courteous
offered the weather

Lamhorn refused it and concluded from Bibbss luxurious attitude in the
leather chair that this halfcrazy brother was a permanent fixture for
the rest of the evening There was not reason to hope that he would
move and Lamhorn found himself in danger of looking silly

I was just going he said rising

Oh NO Edith cried sharply

Yes Good night I think I

Too bad said Bibbs genially walking to the door with the visitor
while Edith stood staring as the two disappeared in the hall She heard
Bibbs offering to help Lamhorn with his overcoat and the latter rather
curtly declining assistance these episodes of departure being followed
by the closing of the outer door She ran into the hall

Whats the matter with you she cried furiously What do you MEAN
How did you dare come in there when you knew

Her voice broke she made a gesture of rage and despair and ran up the
stairs sobbing She fled to her mothers room and when Bibbs came up
a few minutes later Mrs Sheridan met him at his door

Oh Bibbs she said shaking her head woefully youd oughtnt to
distress your sister She says you drove that young man right out of the
house Youd ought to been more considerate

Bibbs smiled faintly noting that Ediths door was open with Ediths
naive shadow motionless across its threshold Yes he said He
doesnt appear to be much of a mans man He ran at just a glimpse of
one

Ediths shadow moved her voice came quavering You call yourself one

No no he answered I said just a glimpse of one I didnt
claim But her door slammed angrily and he turned to his mother

There he said sighing Thats almost the first time in my life I
ever tried to be a man of action mother and I succeeded perfectly in
what I tried to do As a consequence I feel like a horsethief

You hurt her feelins she groaned You must a gone at it too
rough Bibbs

He looked upon her wanly Thats my trouble mother he murmured Im
a plain blunt fellow I have rough ways and Im a rough man

For once she perceived some meaning in his queerness Hush your
nonsense she said goodnaturedly the astral of a troubled smile
appearing You go to bed

He kissed her and obeyed


Edith gave him a cold greeting the next morning at the breakfasttable

You mustnt do that under a misapprehension he warned her when they
were alone in the diningroom

Do what under a what she asked

Speak to me I came into the smokingroom last night on purpose he
told her gravely I have a prejudice against that young man

She laughed I guess you think it means a great deal who you have
prejudices against In mockery she adopted the manner of one who
implores Bibbs for pitys sake PROMISE me DONT use YOUR influence
with papa against him And she laughed louder

Listen he said with peculiar earnestness Ill tell you now
becausebecause Ive decided Im one of the family And then as
if the earnestness were too heavy for him to carry it further he
continued in his usual tone Im drunk with power Edith

What do you want to tell me she demanded brusquely

Lamhorn made love to Sibyl he said

Edith hooted SHE did to HIM And because you overheard that spat
between us the other day when I the same as accused her of it and said
something like that to you afterward

No he said gravely I KNOW

How

I was there one day a week ago with Roscoe and I heard Sibyl and
Lamhorn

Edith screamed with laughter You were with ROSCOEand you heard
Lamhorn making love to Sibyl

No I heard them quarreling

Youre funnier than ever Bibbs she cried You say he made love to
her because you heard them quarreling

Thats it If you want to know whats between people you canby the
way they quarrel

Youll kill me Bibbs What were they quarreling about

Nothing Thats how I knew People who quarrel over nothingits
always certain

Edith stopped laughing abruptly but continued her mockery You ought
to know Youve had so much experience yourself

I havent any Edith he said My life has been about as exciting as
an incubator chickens But I look out through the glass at things

Well then she said if you look out through the glass you must know
what effect such stuff would have upon ME She rose visibly agitated
What if it WAS true she demanded bitterly What if it was true a
hundred times over You sit there with your silly face half ready to
giggle and half ready to sniffle and tell me stories like that about
Sibyl picking on Bobby Lamhorn and worrying him to death and you think
it matters to ME What if I already KNEW all about their quarreling
What if I understood WHY she She broke off with a violent gesture a
sweep of her arm extended at full length as if she hurled something to
the ground Do you think a girl that really cared for a man would pay
any attention to THAT Or to YOU Bibbs Sheridan

He looked at her steadily and his gaze was as keen as it was steady
She met it with unwavering pride Finally he nodded slowly as if she
had spoken and he meant to agree with what she said

Ah yes he said I wont come into the smokingroom again Im
sorry Edith Nobody can make you see anything now Youll never see
until you see for yourself The rest of us will do better to keep out of
itespecially me

Thats sensible she responded curtly Youre most surprising of all
when youre sensible Bibbs

Yes he sighed Im a dull dog Shake hands and forgive me Edith

Thawing so far as to smile she underwent this brief ceremony and
George appeared summoning Bibbs to the library Dr Gurney was waiting
there he announced And Bibbs gave his sister a shy but friendly touch
upon the shoulder as a complement to the handshaking and left her

Dr Gurney was sitting by the log fire alone in the room and he merely
glanced over his shoulder when his patient came in He was not over
fifty in spite of Sheridans habitual ole Doc Gurney He was gray
however almost as thin as Bibbs and nearly always he looked drowsy

Your father telephoned me yesterday afternoon Bibbs he said not
rising Wants me to look you over again Come around here in front of
mebetween me and the fire I want to see if I can see through you

You mean youre too sleepy to move returned Bibbs complying I
think youll notice that Im getting worse

Taken on about twelve pounds said Gurney Thirteen maybe

Twelve

Well it wont do The doctor rubbed his eyelids Youre so much
better Ill have to use some machinery on you before we can know just
where you are You come down to my place this afternoon Walk downall
the way I suppose you know why your father wants to know

Bibbs nodded Machineshop

Still hate it

Bibbs nodded again

Dont blame you the doctor grunted Yes I expect itll make a lump
in your gizzard again Well what do you say Shall I tell him youve
got the old lump there yet You still want to write do you

Whats the use Bibbs said smiling ruefully My kind of writing

Yes the doctor agreed I suppose it you broke away and lived on
roots and berries until you began to attract the favorable attention of
editors you might be able to hope for an income of four or five hundred
dollars a year by the time youre fifty

Thats about it Bibbs murmured

Of course I know what you want to do said Gurney drowsily You
dont hate the machineshop only you hate the whole showthe noise and
jar and dirt the scramblethe whole bloomin craze to get on Youd
like to go somewhere in Algiers or to Taormina perhaps and bask on a
balcony smelling flowers and writing sonnets Youd grow fat on it and
have a delicate little life all to yourself Well what do you say I
can lie like sixty Bibbs Shall I tell your father hell lose another
of his boys if you dont go to Sicily

I dont want to go to Sicily said Bibbs I want to stay right here

The doctors drowsiness disappeared for a moment and he gave his
patient a sharp glance Its a risk he said I think well find
youre so much better hell send you back to the shop pretty quick
Somethings got hold of you lately youre not quite so lackadaisical as
you used to be But I warn you I think the shop will knock you just as
it did before and perhaps even harder Bibbs

He rose shook himself and rubbed his eyelids Well when we go over
you this afternoon what are we going to say about it

Tell him Im ready said Bibbs looking at the floor

Oh no Gurney laughed Not quite yet but you may be almost Well
see Dont forget I said to walk down

And when the examination was concluded that afternoon the doctor
informed Bibbs that the result was much too satisfactory to be pleasing
Heres a new situation for a oneact farce he said gloomily to
his next patient when Bibbs had gone Doctor tells a man hes well and
thats his death sentence likely Dam funny world

Bibbs decided to walk home though Gurney had not instructed him upon
this point In fact Gurney seemed to have no more instructions on any
point so discouraging was the young mans improvement It was a dingy
afternoon and the smoke was evident not only to Bibbss sight but to
his nostrils though most of the pedestrians were so saturated with
the smell they could no longer detect it Nearly all of them walked
hurriedly too intent upon their destinations to be more than half aware
of the wayside they wore the expressions of people under a vague yet
constant strain They were all lightly powdered inside and out with
fine dust and grit from the hardpaved streets and they were unaware of
that also They did not even notice that they saw the smoke though the
thickened air was like a shrouding mist And when Bibbs passed the new
Sheridan Apartments now almost completed he observed that the marble
of the vestibule was already streaky with soot like his gloves which
were new

That recalled to him the faint odor of gasolene in the coupe on the way
from his brothers funeral and this incited a train of thought which
continued till he reached the vicinity of his home His route was by
a street parallel to that on which the New House fronted and in his
preoccupation he walked a block farther than he intended so that
having crossed to his own street he approached the New House from the
north and as he came to the corner of Mr Vertreess lot Mr Vertreess
daughter emerged from the front door and walked thoughtfully down the
path to the old picket gate She was unconscious of the approach of the
pedestrian from the north and did not see him until she had opened the
gate and he was almost beside her Then she looked up and as she
saw him she started visibly And if this thing had happened to
Robert Lamhorn he would have had a thought far beyond the horizon of
fainthearted Bibbss thoughts Lamhorn indeed would have spoken his
thought He would have said You jumped because you were thinking of
me



CHAPTER XV

Mary was the picture of a lady flustered She stood with one hand
closing the gate behind her and she had turned to go in the direction
Bibbs was walking There appeared to be nothing for it but that they
should walk together at least as far as the New House But Bibbs had
paused in his slow stride and there elapsed an instant before either
spoke or movedit was no longer than that and yet it sufficed for each
to seem to say by look and attitude Why its YOU

Then they both spoke at once each hurriedly pronouncing the others
name as if about to deliver a message of importance Then both came to
a stop simultaneously but Bibbs made a heroic effort and as they began
to walk on together he contrived to find his voice

IIhate a frozen fish myself he said I think three miles was too
long for you to put up with one

Good gracious she cried turning to him a glowing face from which
restraint and embarrassment had suddenly fled Mr Sheridan youre
lovely to put it that way But its always the girls place to say its
turning cooler I ought to have been the one to show that we didnt know
each other well enough not to say SOMETHING It was an imposition for
me to have made you bring me home and after I went into the house I
decided I should have walked Besides it wasnt three miles to the
carline I never thought of it

No said Bibbs earnestly I didnt either I might have said
something if Id thought of anything Im talking now though I must
remember that and not worry about it later I think Im talking though
it doesnt sound intelligent even to me I made up my mind that if I
ever met you again Id turn on my voice and keep it going no mater what
it said I

She interrupted him with laughter and Mary Vertreess laugh was one
which Bibbss father had declared after the housewarming a cripple
would crawl five miles to hear And at the merry lilting of it Bibbss
fathers son took heart to forget some of his trepidation Ill be any
kind of idiot he said if youll laugh at me some more It wont be
difficult for me

She did and Bibbss cheeks showed a little actual color which Mary
perceived It recalled to her by contrast her careless and irritated
description of him to her mother just after she had seen him for the
first time Rather tragic and altogether impossible It seemed to her
now that she must have been blind

They had passed the New House without either of them showingor
possessingany consciousness that it had been the destination of one of
them

Ill keep on talking Bibbs continued cheerfully and you keep on
laughing Im amounting to something in the world this afternoon Im
making a noise and that makes you make music Dont be bothered by my
bleating out such things as that Im really frightened and that makes
me bleat anything Im frightened about two things Im afraid of what
Ill think of myself later if I dont keep talkingtalking now I
meanand Im afraid of what Ill think of myself if I do And besides
these two things Im frightened anyhow I dont remember talking as
much as this more than once or twice in my life I suppose it was always
in me to do it though the first time I met any one who didnt know me
well enough not to listen

But youre not really talking to me said Mary Youre just thinking
aloud

No he returned gravely Im not thinking at all Im only making
vocal sounds because I believe its more mannerly I seem to be the
subject of what little meaning they possess and Id like to change it
but I dont know how I havent any experience in talking and I dont
know how to manage it

You neednt change the subject on my account Mr Sheridan she said
Not even if you really talked about yourself She turned her
face toward him as she spoke and Bibbs caught his breath he was
pathetically amazed by the look she gave him It was a glowing look
warmly friendly and understanding and what almost shocked him it was
an eagerly interested look Bibbs was not accustomed to anything like
that

IyouIIm he stammered and the faint color in his cheeks grew
almost vivid

She was still looking at him and she saw the strange radiance that came
into his face There was something about him too that explained how
queer many people might think him but he did not seem queer to Mary
Vertrees he seemed the most quaintly natural person she had ever met

He waited and became coherent YOU say something now he said I
dont even belong in the chorus and here I am trying to sing the funny
mans solo You

No she interrupted Id rather play your accompaniment

Ill stop and listen to it then

Perhaps she began but after pausing thoughtfully she made a
gesture with her muff indicating a large brick church which they were
approaching Do you see that church Mr Sheridan

I suppose I could he answered in simple truthfulness looking at her
But I dont want to Once when I was ill the nurse told me Id better
say anything that was on my mind and I got the habit The other reason
I dont want to see the church is that I have a feeling its where
youre going and where Ill be sent back

She shook her head in cheery negation Not unless you want to be Would
you like to come with me

Whywhyyes he said Anywhere And again it was apparent that he
spoke in simple truthfulness

Then comeif you care for organ music The organist is an old friend
of mine and sometimes he plays for me Hes a dear old man He had
a degree from Bonn and was a professor afterward but he gave up
everything for music Thats he waiting in the doorway He looks like
Beethoven doesnt he I think he knows that perhaps and enjoys it a
little I hope so

Yes said Bibbs as they reached the church steps I think Beethoven
would like it too It must be pleasant to look like other people

I havent kept you Mary said to the organist

No no he answered heartily I would not mind so only you should
shooer come

This is Mr Sheridan Dr Kraft He has come to listen with me

The organist looked bluntly surprised Iss that SO he exclaimed
Well I am glad if you wish him and if he can stant my liddle playink
He iss musician himself then of course

No said Bibbs as the three entered the church together II played
theI tried to play Fortunately he checked himself he had been
about to offer the information that he had failed to master the
jewsharp in his boyhood No Im not a musician he contented
himself with saying

What Dr Krafts surprise increased Young man you are fortunate
I play for Miss Vertrees she comes always alone You are the first You
are the first one EVER

They had reached the head of the central aisle and as the organist
finished speaking Bibbs stopped short turning to look at Mary Vertrees
in a dazed way that was not of her perceiving for though she stopped
as he did her gaze followed the organist who was walking away from
them toward the front of the church shaking his white Beethovian mane
roguishly

Its false pretenses on my part Bibbs said You mean to be kind to
the sick but Im not an invalid any more Im so well Im going back
to work in a few days Id better leave before he begins to play hadnt
I

No said Mary beginning to walk forward Not unless you dont like
great music

He followed her to a seat about halfway up the aisle while Dr Kraft
ascended to the organ It was an enormous one the procession of pipes
ranging from long starveling whistles to thundering fat guns they
covered all the rear wall of the church and the organists figure
reaching its high perch looked like that of some Lilliputian magician
ludicrously daring the attempt to control a monster certain to overwhelm
him

This afternoon some Handel he turned to shout

Mary nodded Will you like that she asked Bibbs

I dont know I never heard any except Largo I dont know anything
about music I dont even know how to pretend I do If I knew enough to
pretend I would

No said Mary looking at him and smiling faintly you wouldnt

She turned away as a great sound began to swim and tremble in the air
the huge empty space of the church filled with it and the two people
listening filled with it the universe seemed to fill and thrill with
it The two sat intensely still the great sound all round about them
while the church grew dusky and only the organists lamp made a
tiny star of light His white head moved from side to side beneath it
rhythmically or lunged and recovered with the fierceness of a duelist
thrusting but he was magnificently the master of his giant and it sang
to his magic as he bade it

Bibbs was swept away upon that mighty singing Such a thing was wholly
unknown to him there had been no music in his meager life Unlike
the tale it was the Princess Bedrulbudour who had brought him to the
enchanted cave and thatfor Bibbswas what made its magic dazing It
seemed to him a long long time since he had been walking home drearily
from Dr Gurneys office it seemed to him that he had set out upon a
happy journey since then and that he had reached another planet where
Mary Vertrees and he sat alone together listening to a vast choiring of
invisible soldiers and holy angels There were armies of voices about
them singing praise and thanksgiving and yet they were alone It was
incredible that the walls of the church were not the boundaries of
the universe to remain so for ever incredible that there was a smoky
street just yonder where housemaids were bringing in evening papers
from front steps and where children were taking their last spins on
rollerskates before being haled indoors for dinner

He had a curious sense of communication with his new friend He knew
it could not be so and yet he felt as if all the time he spoke to her
saying You hear this strain You hear that strain You know the dream
that these sounds bring to me And it seemed to him as though she
answered continually I hear I hear that strain and I hear the new
one that you are hearing now I know the dream that these sounds bring
to you Yes yes I hear it all We heartogether

And though the church grew so dim that all was mysterious shadow except
the vague planes of the windows and the organists light with the white
head moving beneath it Bibbs had no consciousness that the girl sitting
beside him had grown shadowy he seemed to see her as plainly as ever in
the darkness though he did not look at her And all the mighty chanting
of the organs multitudinous voices that afternoon seemed to Bibbs to be
chorusing of her and interpreting her singing her thoughts and singing
for him the world of humble gratitude that was in his heart because she
was so kind to him It all meant Mary



CHAPTER XVI

But when she asked him what it meant on their homeward way he was
silent They had come a few paces from the church without speaking
walking slowly

Ill tell you what it meant to me she said as he did not immediately
reply Almost any music of Handels always means one thing above all
others to me courage Thats it It makes cowardice of whining seem so
infinitesimalit makes MOST things in our hustling little lives seem
infinitesimal

Yes he said It seems odd doesnt it that people downtown are
hurrying to trains and hanging to straps in trolleycars weltering
every way to get home and feed and sleep so they can get downtown
tomorrow And yet there isnt anything down there worth getting to
Theyre like servants drudging to keep the house going and believing
the drudgery itself is the great thing They make so much noise and fuss
and dirt they forget that the house was meant to live in The housework
has to be done but the people who do it have been so overpaid that
theyre confused and worship the housework Theyre overpaid and yet
poor things they havent anything that a chicken cant have Of
course when the world gets to paying its wages sensibly that will be
different

Do you mean communism she asked and she made their slow pace a
little slowerthey had only three blocks to go

Whatever the word is I only mean that things dont look very sensible
nowespecially to a man that wants to keep out of em and cant
Communism Well at least any decent sport would say its fair for
all the strong runners to start from the same mark and give the weak
ones a fair distance ahead so that all can run something like even
on the stretch And wouldnt it be pleasant really if they could all
cross the winningline together Who really enjoys beating anybodyif
he sees the beaten mans face The only way we can enjoy getting ahead
of other people nowadays is by forgetting what the other people feel
And that he added is nothing of what the music meant to me You see
if I keep talking about what it didnt mean I can keep from telling you
what it did mean

Didnt it mean courage to you tooa little she asked Triumph and
praise were in it and somehow those things mean courage to me

Yes they were all there Bibbs said I dont know the name of what
he played but I shouldnt think it would matter much The man that
makes the music must leave it to you what it can mean to you and the
name he puts to it cant make much differenceexcept to himself and
people very much like him I suppose

I suppose thats true though Id never thought of it like that

I imagine music must make feelings and paint pictures in the minds of
the people who hear it Bibbs went on musingly according to their
own natures as much as according to the music itself The musician might
compose something and play it wanting you to think of the Holy Grail
and some people who heard it would think of a prayermeeting and some
would think of how good they were themselves and a boy might think of
himself at the head of a solemn procession carrying a banner and riding
a white horse And then if there were some jubilant passages in the
music hed think of a circus

They had reached her gate and she set her hand upon it but did
not open it Bibbs felt that this was almost the kindest of her
kindnessesnot to be prompt in leaving him

After all she said you didnt tell me whether you liked it

No I didnt need to

No thats true and I didnt need to ask I knew But you said you
were trying to keep from telling me what it did mean

I cant keep from telling it any longer he said The music meant to
meit meant the kindness ofof you

Kindness How

You thought I was a sort of lonely trampand sick

No she said decidedly I thought perhaps youd like to hear Dr
Kraft play And you did

Its curious sometimes it seemed to me that it was you who were
playing

Mary laughed I I strum Piano A little ChopinGriegChaminade You
wouldnt listen

Bibbs drew a deep breath Im frightened again he said in an
unsteady voice Im afraid youll think Im pushing but He paused
and the words sank to a murmur

Oh if you want ME to play for you she said Yes gladly It will be
merely absurd after what you heard this afternoon I play like a hundred
thousand other girls and I like it Im glad when any ones willing to
listen and if you She stopped checked by a sudden recollection
and laughed ruefully But my piano wont be here after tonight IIm
sending it away tomorrow Im afraid that if youd like me to play to
you youd have to come this evening

Youll let me he cried

Certainly if you care to

If I could play he said wistfully if I could play like that old
man in the church I could thank you

Ah but you havent heard me play I KNOW you liked this afternoon
but

Yes said Bibbs It was the greatest happiness Ive ever known

It was too dark to see his face but his voice held such plain honesty
and he spoke with such complete unconsciousness of saying anything
especially significant that she knew it was the truth For a moment she
was nonplussed then she opened the gate and went in Youll come after
dinner then

Yes he said not moving Would you mind if I stood here until time
to come in

She had reached the steps and at that she turned offering him the
response of laughter and a gay gesture of her muff toward the lighted
windows of the New House as though bidding him to run home to his
dinner

That night Bibbs sat writing in his notebook

 Music can come into a blank life and fill it Everything that
 is beautiful is music if you can listen

 There is no gracefulness like that of a graceful woman at a grand
 piano There is a swimming loveliness of line that seems to merge
 with the running of the sound and you seem as you watch her to
 see what you are hearing and to hear what you are seeing

 There are women who make you think of pine woods coming down to
 a sparkling sea The air about such a woman is bracing and when
 she is near you you feel strong and ambitious you forget that
 the world doesnt like you You think that perhaps you are a great
 fellow after all Then you come away and feel like a boy who has
 fallen in love with his Sundayschool teacher Youll be whipped
 for itand ought to be

 There are women who make you think of Diana crowned with the moon
 But they do not have the Greek profile I do not believe Helen
 of Troy had a Greek profile they would not have fought about her
 if her nose had been quite that long The Greek nose is not the
 adorable nose The adorable nose is about an eighth of an inch
 shorter

 Much of the music of Wagner it appears is not suitable to the
 piano Wagner was a composer who could interpret into music such
 things as the primitive impulses of humanityhe could have made a
 machineshop into music But not if he had to work in it Wagner
 was always dealing in immensitiesa machineshop would have put a
 majestic lump in so grand a gizzard as that

 There is a mystery about pianos it seems Sometimes they have to
 be sent away That is how some people speak of the penitentiary
 Sent away is a euphuism for sent to prison But pianos are not
 sent to prison and they are not sent to the tunerthe tuner is
 sent to them Why are pianos sent awayand where

 Sometimes a glorious day shines into the most ordinary and useless
 life Happiness and beauty come caroling out of the air into the
 gloomy house of that life as if some stray angel just happened to
 perch on the rooftree resting and singing And the night after
 such a day is lustrous and splendid with the memory of it Music
 and beauty and kindnessthose are the three greatest things God
 can give us To bring them all in one day to one who expected
 nothingah the heart that received them should be as humble as
 it is thankful But it is hard to be humble when one is so rich
 with new memories It is impossible to be humble after a day of
 glory

 Yesthe adorable nose is more than an eighth of an inch shorter
 than the Greek nose It is a full quarter of an inch shorter

 There are women who will be kinder to a sick tramp than to a
 conquering hero But the sick tramp had better remember thats
 what he is Take care take care Humbles the word



CHAPTER XVII

That mystery about pianos which troubled Bibbs had been a mystery to
Mr Vertrees and it was being explained to him at about the time Bibbs
scribbled the reference to it in his notes Mary had gone upstairs upon
Bibbss departure at ten oclock and Mr and Mrs Vertrees sat until
after midnight in the library talking And in all that time they found
not one cheerful topic but became more depressed with everything and
with every phase of everything that they discussedno extraordinary
state of affairs in a family which has always held up its head
only to arrive in the end at a point where all it can do is to look on
helplessly at the processes of its own financial dissolution For that
was the point which this despairing couple had reachedthey could do
nothing except look on and talk about it They were only vaporing and
they knew it

She neednt to have done that about her piano vapored Mr Vertrees
We could have managed somehow without it At least she ought to have
consulted me and if she insisted I could have arranged the details with
thethe dealer

She thought that it might beannoying for you Mrs Vertrees
explained Really she planned for you not to know about it until
they had removeduntil after tomorrow that is but I decided toto
mention it You see she didnt even tell me about it until this
morning She has another idea too Im afraid Itsits

Well he urged as she found it difficult to go on

Her other idea isthat is it wasI think it can be avoided of
courseit was about her furs

No he exclaimed quickly I wont have it You must see to that Id
rather not talk to her about it but you mustnt let her

Ill try not his wife promised Of course theyre very handsome

All the more reason for her to keep them he returned irritably
Were not THAT far gone I think

Perhaps not yet Mrs Vertrees said She seems to be troubled about
thethe coal matter andabout Tilly Of course the piano will take
care of some things like those for a while and

I dont like it I gave her the piano to play on not to

You mustnt be distressed about it in ONE way she said comfortingly
She arranged with thewith the purchaser that the men will come for it
about half after five in the afternoon The days are so short now its
really quite winter

Oh yes he agreed moodily So far as that goes people have a
right to move a piece of furniture without stirring up the neighbors I
suppose even by daylight I dont suppose OUR neighbors are paying much
attention just now though I hear Sheridan was back in his office early
the morning after the funeral

Mrs Vertrees made a little sound of commiseration I dont believe
that was because he wasnt suffering though Im sure it was only
because he felt his business was so important Mary told me he seemed
wrapped up in his sons succeeding and that was what he bragged about
most He isnt vulgar in his boasting I understand he doesnt talk a
great deal about hishis actual moneythough there was something about
blades of grass that I didnt comprehend I think he meant something
about his energybut perhaps not No his bragging usually seemed to be
not so much a personal vainglory as about his family and the greatness
of this city

Greatness of this city Mr Vertrees echoed with dull bitterness
Its nothing but a coalhole I suppose it looks great to the man who
has the luck to make it work for him I suppose it looks great to any
YOUNG man too starting out to make his fortune out of it The fellows
that get what they want out of it say its great and everybody else
gets the habit But you have a different point of view if its the
city that got what it wanted out of you Of course Sheridan says its
great

Mrs Vertrees seemed unaware of this unusual outburst I believe she
began timidly he doesnt boast ofthat is I understand he has never
seemed so interested in thethe other one

Her husbands face was dark but at that a heavier shadow fell upon
it he looked more haggard than before The other one he repeated
averting his eyes You meanyou mean the third sonthe one that was
here this evening

Yes thethe youngest she returned her voice so feeble it was
almost a whisper

And then neither of them spoke for several long minutes Nor did either
look at the other during that silence

At last Mr Vertrees contrived to cough but not convincingly
Whatahwhat was it Mary said about him out in the hall when she
came in this afternoon I heard you asking her something about him but
she answered in such a low voice I didntahhappen to catch it

Sheshe didnt say much All she said was this I asked her if she had
enjoyed her walk with him and she said Hes the most wistful creature
Ive ever known

Well

That was all He IS wistfullooking and so fragilethough he doesnt
seem quite so much so lately I was watching Mary from the window when
she went out today and he joined her and if I hadnt known about him
Id have thought he had quite an interesting face

If you hadnt known about him Known what

Oh nothing of course she said hurriedly Nothing definite that
is Mary said decidely long ago that hes not at all insane as we
thought at first Its onlywell of course it IS odd their attitude
about him I suppose its some nervous trouble that makes himperhaps
a little queer at times so that he cant apply himself to anythingor
perhaps does odd things But after all of course we only have an
impression about it We dont knowthat is positively I She
paused then went on I didnt know just how to askthat isI didnt
mention it to Mary I didntI The poor lady floundered pitifully
concluding with a mumble So soon afterafter thethe shock

I dont think Ive caught more than a glimpse of him said Mr
Vertrees I wouldnt know him if I saw him but your impression of
him is He broke off suddenly springing to his feet in agitation I
cant imagine heroh NO he gasped And he began to pace the floor
A halfwitted epileptic

No no she cried He may be all right We

Oh its horrible I cant He threw himself back into his chair
again sweeping his hands across his face then letting them fall limply
at his sides

Mrs Vertrees was tremulous You mustnt give way so she said
inspired for once almost to direct discourse Whatever Mary might think
of doing it wouldnt be on her own account it would be on ours But if
WE shouldshould consider it that wouldnt be on OUR own account It
isnt because we think of ourselves

Oh God no he groaned Not for us We can go to the poorhouse but
Mary cant be a stenographer

Sighing Mrs Vertrees resumed her obliqueness Of course she
murmured it all seems very premature speculating about such things
but I had a queer sort of feeling that she seemed quite interested in
this She had almost said in this one but checked herself In this
young man Its natural of course she is always so strong and well
and he ishe seems to be that israther appealing to thethe
sympathies

Yes he agreed bitterly Precisely The sympathies

Perhaps she faltered perhaps you might feel easier if I could have
a little talk with some one

With whom

I had thought ofnot going about it too brusquely of course but
perhaps just waiting for his name to be mentioned if I happened to
be talking with somebody that knew the familyand then I might find
a chance to say that I was sorry to hear hed been ill so much
andSomething of that kind perhaps

You dont know anybody that knows the family

Yes That iswell in a way of course one OF the family That Mrs
Roscoe Sheridan is not athat is shes rather a pleasantfaced little
woman I think and of course rather ordinary I think she is interested
aboutthat is of course shed be anxious to be more intimate with
Mary naturally Shes always looking over here from her house she
was looking out the window this afternoon when Mary went out I
noticedthough I dont think Mary saw her Im sure she wouldnt think
it out of place toto be frank about matters She called the other day
and Mary must rather like hershe said that evening that the call had
done her good Dont you think it might be wise

Wise I dont know I feel the whole matter is impossible

Yes so do I she returned promptly It isnt really a thing we
should be considering seriously of course Still

I should say not But possibly

Thus they skirmished up and down the field but before they turned the
lights out and went upstairs it was thoroughly understood between
them that Mrs Vertrees should seek the earliest opportunity to obtain
definite information from Sibyl Sheridan concerning the mental and
physical status of Bibbs And if he were subject to attacks of lunacy
the unhappy pair decided to prevent the sacrifice they supposed their
daughter intended to make of herself Altogether if there were spiteful
ghosts in the old house that night eavesdropping upon the woeful
comedy they must have died anew of laughter

Mrs Vertreess opportunity occurred the very next afternoon Darkness
had fallen and the pianomovers had come They were carrying the piano
down the front steps and Mrs Vertrees was standing in the open doorway
behind them preparing to withdraw when she heard a sharp exclamation
and Mrs Roscoe Sheridan bareheaded emerged from the shadow into the
light of the doorway

Good gracious she cried It did give me a fright

Its Mrs Sheridan isnt it Mrs Vertrees was perplexed by this
informal appearance but she reflected that it might be providential
Wont you come in

No Oh no thank you Sibyl panted pressing her hand to her side
You dont know what a fright youve given me And it was nothing but
your piano She laughed shrilly You know since our tragedy coming
so suddenly the other day you have no idea how upset Ive beenalmost
hysterical And I just glanced out of the window a minute or so ago
and saw your door wide open and black figures of men against the light
carrying something heavy and I almost fainted You see it was just the
way it looked when I saw them bringing my poor brotherinlaw in
next door only such a few short days ago And I thought Id seen your
daughter start for a drive with Bibbs Sheridan in a car about three
oclockand They arent back yet are they

No Good heavens

And the only thing I could think of was that something must have
happened to them and I just dashed overand it was only your PIANO
She broke into laughter again I suppose youre just sending it
somewhere to be repaired arent you

Itsits being taken downtown said Mrs Vertrees Wont you come
in and make me a little visit I was SO sorry the other day that I
wasah She stopped inconsequently then repeated her invitation
Wont you come in Id really

Thank you but I must be running back My husband usually gets home
about this time and I make a little point of it always to be there

Thats very sweet Mrs Vertrees descended the steps and walked toward
the street with Sibyl Its quite balmy for so late in November isnt
it Almost like a May evening

Im afraid Miss Vertrees will miss her piano said Sibyl watching
the instrument disappear into the big van at the curb She plays
wonderfully Mrs Kittersby tells me

Yes she plays very well One of your relatives came to hear her
yesterday after dinner and I think she played all evening for him

You mean Bibbs asked Sibyl

Thethe youngest Mr Sheridan Yes Hes very musical isnt he

I never heard of it But I shouldnt think it would matter much whether
he was or not if he could get Miss Vertrees to play to him Does your
daughter expect the piano back soon

II believe not immediately Mr Sheridan came last evening to hear
her play because she had arranged with thethat is it was to be
removed this afternoon He seems almost well again

Yes Sibyl nodded His fathers going to try to start him to work

He seems very delicate said Mrs Vertrees I shouldnt think he
would be able to stand a great deal either physically or She paused
and then added glowing with the sense of her own adroitnessor
mentally

Oh mentally Bibbs is all right said Sibyl in an odd voice

Entirely Mrs Vertrees asked breathlessly

Yes entirely

But has he ALWAYS been This question came with the same anxious
eagerness

Certainly He had a long siege of nervous dyspepsia but hes over it

And you think

Bibbs is all right You neednt wor Sibyl choked and pressed
her handkerchief to her mouth Good night Mrs Vertrees she said
hurriedly as the headlights of an automobile swung round the corner
above sending a brightening glare toward the edge of the pavement where
the two ladies were standing

Wont you come in urged Mrs Vertrees cordially hearing the sound
of a cheerful voice out of the darkness beyond the approaching glare
Do Theres Mary now and she

But Sibyl was halfway across the street No thanks she called
I hope she wont miss her piano And she ran into her own house
and plunged headlong upon a leather divan in the hall holding her
handkerchief over her mouth

The noise of her tumultuous entrance was evidently startling in the
quiet house for upon the bang of the door there followed the crash of
a decanter dropped upon the floor of the diningroom at the end of the
hall and after a rumble of indistinct profanity Roscoe came forth
holding a dripping napkin in his hand

Whats your excitement he demanded What do you find to go into
hysterics over Another death in the family

Oh its funny she gasped Those old frostbitten people I guess
THEYRE getting their comeuppance Lying prone she elevated her feet
in the air clapped her heels together repeatedly in an ecstasy

Come through come through said her husband crossly What you been
up to

Me she cried dropping her feet and swinging around to face him
Nothing Its them Those Vertreeses She wiped her eyes Theyve had
to sell their piano

Well what of it

That Mrs Kittersby told me all about em a week ago said Sibyl
Theyve been hard up for a long time and she says as long ago as
last winter she knew that girl got a pair of walkingshoes resoled and
patched because she got it done the same place Mrs Kittersbys cook
had HERS And the night of the housewarming I kind of got suspicious
myself She didnt have one single piece of any kind of real jewelry
and you could see her dress was an old one done over Men cant tell
those things and you all made a big fuss over her but I thought she
looked a sight myself Of course EDITH was crazy to have her and

Well well he urged impatiently

Well Im TELLING you Mrs Kittersby says they havent got a THING
Just absolutely NOTHINGand they dont know anywhere to turn The
familys all died out but them and all the relatives they got are very
distant and live East and scarcely know em She says the whole towns
been wondering what WOULD become of em The girl had plenty chances to
marry up to a year or so ago but she was so indifferent she scared the
men off and the ones that had wanted to went and married other girls
Gracious they were lucky Marry HER The man that found himself tied up
to THAT girl

Terrible funny terrible funny said Roscoe with sarcasm Its so
funny I broke a cutglass decanter and spilled a quart of

Wait she begged Youll see I was sitting by the window a little
while ago and I saw a big wagon drive up across the street and some men
go into the house It was too dark to make out much and for a minute
I got the idea they were moving outthe house has been foreclosed on
Mrs Kittersby says It seemed funny too because I knew that girl was
out riding with Bibbs Well I thought Id see so I slipped overand
it was their PIANO Theyd sold it and were trying to sneak it out after
dark so nobodyd catch on Again she gave way to her enjoyment but
resumed as her husband seemed about to interrupt the narrative Wait a
minute cant you The old lady was superintending and she gave it all
away I sized her up for one of those old churchy people that tell
all kinds of lies except when it comes to so many words and then they
cant She might just as well told me outright Yes theyd sold it
and I hope theyll pay some of their debts They owe everybody and last
week a coaldealer made an awful fuss at the door with Mr Vertrees
Their cook told our upstairs girl and she said she didnt know WHEN
shed seen any money herself Did you ever hear of such a case as that
girl in your LIFE

What girl Their cook

That Vertrees girl Dont you see they looked on our coming up into
this neighborhood as their last chance They were just going down and
out and here bobs up the green rich Sheridan family So they doll
the girl up in her old things made over and send her out to get a
Sheridanshes GOT to get one And she just goes in blind and she
tries it on first with YOU You remember she just plain TOLD you she
was going to mash you and then she found out you were the married one
and turned right square around to Jim and carried him off his feet
Oh Jim was landedtheres no doubt about THAT But Jim was lucky
he didnt live to STAY landed and its a good thing for him Sibyls
mirth had vanished and she spoke with virulent rapidity Well she
couldnt get you because you were married and she couldnt get Jim
because Jim died And there they were dead broke Do you know what she
did Do you know what shes DOING

No I dont said Roscoe gruffly

Sibyls voice rose and culminated in a scream of renewed hilarity
BIBBS She waited in the graveyard and drove home with him from JIMS
FUNERAL Never spoke to him before Jim wasnt COLD

She rocked herself back and forth upon the divan Bibbs she shrieked
Bibbs Roscoe THINK of it BIBBS

He stared unsympathetically but her mirth was unabated for all that
And yesterday she continued between paroxysmsyesterday she came
out of the housejust as he was passing She must have been looking
outwaiting for the chance I saw the old lady watching at the window
And she got him there last nightto PLAY to him the old lady gave
that away And today she made him take her out in a machine And the
cream of it is that they didnt even know whether he was INSANE or
notthey thought maybe he was but she went after him just the same
The old lady set herself to pump me about it today BIBBS Oh my Lord
BIBBS

But Roscoe looked grim So its funny to you is it It sounds kind of
pitiful to me I should think it would to a woman too

Oh it might she returned sobering It might if those people
werent such frozenfaced smart Alecks If theyd had the decency to
come down off the perch a little I probably wouldnt think it was funny
but to see em sit up on their pedestal all the time theyre eating
dirtwell I think its funny That girl sits up as if she was Queen
Elizabeth and expects people to wallow on the ground before her until
they get near enough for her to give em a good kick with her old
patched shoesoh shed do THAT all rightand then she powders up
and goes out to mashBIBBS SHERIDAN

Look here said Roscoe heavily I dont care about that one way or
another If youre through I got something I want to talk to you about
I was going to that day just before we heard about Jim

At this Sibyl stiffened quickly her eyes became intensely bright What
is it

Well he began frowning what I was going to say then He broke
off and becoming conscious that he was still holding the wet napkin in
his hand threw it pettishly into a corner I never expected Id have
to say anything like this to anybody I MARRIED but I was going to ask
you what was the matter between you and Lamhorn

Sibyl uttered a sharp monosyllable Well

I felt the time had come for me to know about it he went on You
never told me anything

You never asked she interposed curtly

Well wed got in a way of not talking much said Roscoe It looks to
me now as if wed pretty much lost the run of each other the way a good
many people do I dont say it wasnt my fault I was up early and down
to work all day and Id come home tired at night and want to go to bed
soon as Id got the paper readunless there was some good musical show
in town Well you seemed all right until here lately the last month or
so I began to see something was wrong I couldnt help seeing it

Wrong she said What like

You changed you didnt look the same You were all strung up and
excited and fidgety you got to looking peakid and run down Now then
Lamhorn had been going with us a good while but I noticed that not long
ago you got to picking on him about every little thing he did you got
to quarreling with him when I was there and when I wasnt I could see
youd been quarreling whenever I came in and he was here

Do you object to that asked Sibyl breathing quickly

Yeswhen it injures my wifes health he returned with a quick lift
of his eyes to hers You began to run down just about the time you
began falling out with him He stepped close to her See here Sibyl
Im going to know what it means

Oh you ARE she snapped

Youre trembling he said gravely

Yes Im angry enough to do more than tremble youll find Go on

That was all I was going to say the other day he said I was going
to ask you

Yes that was all you were going to say THE OTHER DAY Yes What else
have you to say tonight

Tonight he replied with grim swiftness I want to know why you
keep telephoning him you want to see him since he stopped coming here

She made a long low sound of comprehension before she said And what
else did Edith want you to ask me

I want to know what you say over the telephone to Lamhorn he said
fiercely

Is that all Edith told you to ask me You saw her when you stopped in
there on your way home this evening didnt you Didnt she tell you
then what I said over the telephone to Mr Lamhorn

No she didnt he vociferated his voice growing louder She said
You tell your wife to stop telephoning Robert Lamhorn to come and see
her because he isnt going to do it Thats what she said And I want
to know what it means I intend

A maid appeared at the lower end of the hall Dinner is ready she
said and giving the troubled pair one glance went demurely into the
diningroom Roscoe disregarded the interruption

I intend to know exactly what has been going on he declared I mean
to know just what

Sibyl jumped up almost touching him standing face to face with him

Oh you DO she cried shrilly You mean to know just whats what do
you You listen to your sister insinuating ugly things about your
wife and then you come home making a scene before the servants and
humiliating me in their presence Do you suppose that Irish girl didnt
hear every word you said You go in there and eat your dinner alone Go
on Go and eat your dinner alonebecause I wont eat with you

And she broke away from the detaining grasp he sought to fasten upon
her and dashed up the stairway panting He heard the door of her room
slam overhead and the sharp click of the key in the lock



CHAPTER XVIII

At seven oclock on the last morning of that month Sheridan passing
through the upper hall on his way to descend the stairs for breakfast
found a couple of scribbled sheets of notepaper lying on the floor A
window had been open in Bibbss room the evening before he had left his
notebook on the silland the sheets were loose The door was open and
when Bibbs came in and closed it he did not notice that the two sheets
had blown out into the hall Sheridan recognized the handwriting and
put the sheets in his coat pocket intending to give them to George
or Jackson for return to the owner but he forgot and carried them
downtown with him At noon he found himself alone in his office and
having a little leisure remembered the bits of manuscript took them
out and glanced at them A glance was enough to reveal that they were
not epistolary Sheridan would not have read a private letter that
came into his possession in that way though in a matter of business
he might have felt it his duty to take advantage of an opportunity
afforded in any manner whatsoever Having satisfied himself that Bibbss
scribblings were only a sample of the kind of writing his son preferred
to the machineshop he decided innocently enough that he would be
justified in reading them

 It appears that a lady will nod pleasantly upon some windy
 generalization of a companion and will wear the most agreeable
 expression of accepting it as the law and thendays afterward
 when the thing is a mummy to its promulgatorshe will inquire out
 of a clear sky WHY did you say that the people downtown have
 nothing in life that a chicken hasnt What did you mean And she
 may say it in a manner that makes a sensible reply very difficult
 you will be so full of wonder that she remembered so seriously

 Yet what does the rooster lack He has food and shelter he is
 warm in winter his wives raise not one fine family for him but
 dozens He has a clear sky over him he breathes sweet air he
 walks in his April orchard under a roof of flowers He must die
 violently perhaps but quickly Is Midass cancer a better way
 The roosters wives and children must die Are those of Midas
 immortal His life is shorter than the life of Midas but Midass
 life is only a sixth as long as that of the Galapagos tortoise

 The worthy moneyworker takes his vacation so that he may refresh
 himself anew for the hard work of getting nothing that the rooster
 doesnt get The officebuilding has an elevator the rooster
 flies up to the bough Midas has a machine to take him to his work
 the rooster finds his worm underfoot The business man feels
 a pressure sometimes without knowing why and sits late at wine
 after the days labor next morning he curses his head because it
 interferes with the workhe swears never to relieve that pressure
 again The rooster has no pressure and no wine this difference is
 in his favor

 The rooster is a dependent he depends upon the farmer and the
 weather Midas is a dependent he depends upon the farmer and the
 weather The rooster thinks only of the moment Midas provides for
 tomorrow What does he provide for tomorrow Nothing that the
 rooster will not have without providing

 The rooster and the prosperous worker they are born they grub
 they love they grub and love grubbing they grub and they die
 Neither knows beauty neither knows knowledge And after all when
 Midas dies and the rooster dies there is one thing Midas has had
 and rooster has not Midas has had the excitement of accumulating
 what he has grubbed and that has been his life and his love and
 his god He cannot take that god with him when he dies I wonder
 if the worthy gods are those we can take with us

 Midas must teach all to be as Midas the young must be raised in
 his religion

The manuscript ended there and Sheridan was not anxious for more
He crumpled the sheets into a ball depositing it with vigor in a
wastebasket beside him then rising he consulted a Cyclopedia of
Names which a bookagent had somehow sold to him years before a
volume now first put to use for the location of Midas Having read the
legend Sheridan walked up and down the spacious office exhaling
the breath of contempt Dam fool he mumbled But this was no new
thought nor was the contrariness of Bibbss notes a surpise to him and
presently he dismissed the matter from his mind

He felt very lonely and this was daily his hardest hour For a long
time he and Jim had lunched together habitually Roscoe preferred a
club luncheon but Jim and his father almost always went to a small
restaurant near the Sheridan Building where they spent twenty minutes
in the consumption of food and twenty in talk with cigars Jim came
for his father every day at five minutes after twelve and Sheridan
was again in his office at five minutes before one But now that Jim no
longer came Sheridan remained alone in his office he had not gone out
to lunch since Jims death nor did he have anything sent to himhe
fasted until evening

It was the time he missed Jim personally the mostthe voice and eyes
and handshake all brisk and alert all businesslike But these things
were not the keenest in Sheridans grief his sense of loss went far
deeper Roscoe was dependable a steady old wheelhorse and that was
a great comfort but it was in Jim that Sheridan had most happily
perceived his own likeness Jim was the one who would have been surest
to keep the great property growing greater year by year Sheridan had
fallen asleep night after night picturing what the growth would be
under Jim He had believed that Jim was absolutely certain to be one of
the biggest men in the country Well it was all up to Roscoe now

That reminded him of a question he had in mind to ask Roscoe It was a
question Sheridan considered of no present importance but his wife had
suggested itthough vaguelyand he had meant to speak to Roscoe about
it However Roscoe had not come into his fathers office for several
days and when Sheridan had seen his son at home there had been no
opportunity

He waited until the greater part of his days work was over toward four
oclock and then went down to Roscoes office which was on a lower
floor He found several men waiting for business interviews in an outer
room of the series Roscoe occupied and he supposed that he would
find his son busy with others and that his question would have to
be postponed but when he entered the door marked R C Sheridan
Private Roscoe was there alone

He was sitting with his back to the door his feet on a windowsill and
he did not turn as his father opened the door

Some pretty good men out there waitin to see you my boy said
Sheridan Whats the matter

Nothing Roscoe answered indistinctly not moving

Well I guess thats all right too I let em wait sometimes myself
I just wanted to ask you a question but I expect itll keep if youre
workin something out in your mind

Roscoe made no reply and his father who had turned to the door paused
with his hand on the knob staring curiously at the motionless figure in
the chair Usually the son seemed pleased and eager when he came to the
office Youre all right aint you said Sheridan Not sick are
you

No

Sheridan was puzzled then abruptly he decided to ask his question I
wanted to talk to you about that young Lamhorn he said I guess your
mother thinks hes comin to see Edith pretty often and you known him
longern any of us so

I wont said Roscoe thicklyI wont say a dam thing about him

Sheridan uttered an exclamation and walked quickly to a position
near the window where he could see his sons face Roscoes eyes were
bloodshot and vacuous his hair was disordered his mouth was distorted
and he was deathly pale The father stood aghast

By George he muttered ROSCOE

My name said Roscoe Can help that

ROSCOE Blank astonishment was Sheridans first sensation Probably
nothing in the world could have more amazed his than to find Roscoethe
steady old wheelhorsein this condition Howd you GET this way he
demanded You caught cold and took too much for it

For reply Roscoe laughed hoarsely Yeuh Cold I been drinkun all time
lately Firs you notice it

By George cried Sheridan I THOUGHT Id smelt it on you a good deal
lately but I wouldnt a believed youd take moren was good for you
Boh To see you like a common hog

Roscoe chuckled and threw out his right arm in a meaningless gesture
Hog he repeated chuckling

Yes a hog said Sheridan angrily In business hours I dont object
to anybodys takin a drink if you wants to out o business hours nor
if a man keeps his work right up to the scratch I wouldnt be the one
to baste him if he got good an drunk once in two three years maybe
It aint MY way I let it alone but I never believed in forcin my way
on a grownup son in moral matters I guess I was wrong You think them
men out there are waitin to talk business with a drunkard You think
you can come to your office and do business drunk By George I wonder
how often this has been happening and me not on to it Ill have a look
over your books tomorrow and Ill

Roscoe stumbled to his feet laughing wildly and stood swaying
contriving to hold himself in position by clutching the back of the
heavy chair in which he had been sitting

Hoohoorah he cried S my principles too Be drunkard all you
want tooutside business hours Don for Gossake lenthing innerfere
business hours Business Thassit Youre right father Drink Die
Leverything go to hell but DON let innerfere business

Sheridan had seized the telephone upon Roscoes desk and was calling
his own office overhead Abercrombie Come down to my son Roscoes
suite and get rid of some gentlemen that are waitin there to see him in
room twofourteen Theres Maples and Schirmer and a couple o fellows
on the Kinsey business Tell em somethings come up I have to go over
with Roscoe and tell em to come back day after tomorrow at two
You neednt come in to let me know theyre gone we dont want to be
disturbed Tell Pauly to call my house and send Claus down here with a
closed car We may have to go out Tell him to hustle and call me at
Roscoes room as soon as the car gets here Ts all

Roscoe had laughed bitterly throughout this monologue Drunk in
business hours Thass awfl Musn do such thing Musn get drunk
musn gamble musn kill nybodynot in business hours All right any
other time Kill nybody you want tos long taint in business
hours Fine Musn have any trouble tll innerfere business Keep your

Have funerals on Sundaymight innerfere business Don let your wife
innerfere business Keep all all ALL your trouble an your meanness
an your tradyour tradegykeep em ALL for home use If you got die
go on die t homedon die round th office Might innerfere business

Sheridan picked up a newspaper from Roscoes desk and sat down with his
back to his son affecting to read Roscoe seemed to be unaware of his
fathers significant posture

You know wh I think he went on I think Bibbs only one the famly
any telligence at all Won work an din get married Jim worked
an he got killed I worked an I got married Look at me Jus look at
me I ask you Fine dustriss young business man Look whass happen to
me Fine He lifted his hand from the sustaining chair in a deplorable
gesture and immediately losing his balance fell across the chair
and caromed to the floor with a crash remaining prostrate for several
minutes during which Sheridan did not relax his apparent attention to
the newspaper He did not even look round at the sound of Roscoes fall

Roscoe slowly climbed to an upright position pulling himself up
by holding to the chair He was slightly sobered outwardly having
progressed in the prostrate interval to a state of befuddlement less
volatile He rubbed his dazed eyes with the back of his left hand

Whatwhat you ask me while ago he said

Nothin

Yes you did Whatwhat was it

Nothin You better sit down

You ask me what I thought about Lamhorn You did ask me that Well I
wont tell you I wont say dam word bout him

The telephonebell tinkled Sheridan placed the receiver to his ear and
said Right down Then he got Roscoes coat and hat from a closet and
brought them to his son Get into this coat he said Youre goin
home

All ri Roscoe murmured obediently

They went out into the main hall by a side door not passing through the
outer office and Sheridan waited for an empty elevator stopped it and
told the operator to take on no more passengers until they reached
the ground floor Roscoe walked out of the building and got into the
automobile without lurching and twenty minutes later walked into his
own house in the same manner neither he nor his father having spoken a
word in the interval

Sheridan did not go in with him he went home and to his own room
without meeting any of his family But as he passed Bibbss door he
heard from within the sound of a cheerful young voice humming jubilant
fragments of song

 WHO looks a mustang in the eye
 With a leap from the ground
 To the saddle in a bound
 And awayand away
 Hiyay

It was the first time in Sheridans life that he had ever detected
any musical symptom whatever in Bibbshe had never even heard him
whistleand it seemed the last touch of irony that the useless fool
should be merry today

To Sheridan it was Tom o Bedlam singing while the house burned and he
did not tarry to enjoy the melody but went into his own room and locked
the door



CHAPTER XIX

He emerged only upon a second summons to dinner two hours later and
came to the table so white and silent that his wife made her anxiety
manifest and was but partially reassured by his explanation that his
lunch had disagreed with him a little

Presently however he spoke effectively Bibbs whose appetite had
become hearty was helping himself to a second breast of capon from
whitejackets salver Heres another difference between Midas and
chicken Sheridan remarked grimly Midas can eat rooster but rooster
cant eat Midas I reckon you overlooked that Midas looks to me like he
had the advantage there

Bibbs retained enough presence of mind to transfer the capon breast to
his plate without dropping it and to respond Yeshe crows over it

Having returned his antagonistss fire in this fashion he blushedfor
he could blush distinctly nowand his mother looked upon him with
pleasure thought the reference to Midas and roosters was of course
jargon to her Did you ever see anybody improve the way that child
has she exclaimed I declare Bibbs sometimes lately you look right
handsome

Hes got to be such a gadabout Edith giggled

I found something of his on the floor upstairs this morning before
anybody was up said Sheridan I reckon if people lose things in this
house and expect to get em back they better get up as soon as I do

What was it he lost asked Edith

He knows her father returned Seems to me like I forgot to bring it
home with me I looked it overthought probably it was something pretty
important belongin to a busy man like him He affected to search
his pockets What DID I do with it now Oh yes Seems to me like I
remember leavin it down at the officein the wastebasket

Good place for it Bibbs murmured still red

Sheridan gave him a grin Perhaps pretty soon youll be gettin up
early enough to find things before I do

It was a threat and Bibbs repeated the substance of it later in the
evening to Mary Vertreesthey had come to know each other that well

My times here at last he said as they sat together in the
melancholy gaslight of the room which had been denuded of its piano
That removal had left an emptiness so distressing to Mr and Mrs
Vertrees that neither of them had crossed the threshold since the dark
day but the gaslight though from a single jet shed no melancholy
upon Bibbs nor could any room seem bare that knew the glowing presence
of Mary He spoke lightly not sadly

Yes its come Ive shirked and put off but I cant shirk and put off
any longer Its really my part to go to himat least it would save my
face He means what he says and the times come to serve my sentence
Hard labor for life I think

Mary shook her head I dont think so Hes too kind

You think my fathers KIND And Bibbs stared at her

Yes Im sure of it Ive felt that he has a great brave heart Its
only that he has to be kind in his own waybecause he cant understand
any other way

Ah yes said Bibbs If thats what you mean by kind

She looked at him gravely earnest concern in her friendly eyes Its
going to be pretty hard for you isnt it

Ohselfpity he returned smiling This has been just the last
flicker of revolt Nobody minds work if he likes the kind of work
Thered be no loafers in the world if each man found the thing that he
could do best but the only work I happen to want to do is uselessso I
have to give it up Tomorrow Ill be a daylaborer

What is it likeexactly

I get up at six he said I have a lunchbasket to carry with me
which is aristocratic and no advantage The other workmen have tin
buckets and tin buckets are better I leave the house at sixthirty
and Im at work in my overalls at seven I have an hour off at noon and
work again from one till five

But the work itself

It wasnt muscularly exhaustingnot at all They couldnt give me a
heavier job because I wasnt good enough

But what will you do I want to know

When I left said Bibbs I was on what they call over there a
clippingmachine in one of the byproducts departments and thats
what Ill be sent back to

But what is it she insisted

Bibbs explained Its very simple and very easy I feed long strips of
zinc into a pair of steel jaws and the jaws bite the zinc into little
circles All I have to do is to see that the strip goes into the jaws at
a certain angleand yet I was a very bad hand at it

He had kept his voice cheerful as he spoke but he had grown a shade
paler and there was a latent anguish deep in his eyes He may have
known it and wished her not to see it for he turned away

You do that all day long she asked and as he nodded It seems
incredible she exclaimed YOU feeding a strip of zinc into a machine
nine hours a day No wonder She broke off and then after a keen
glance at his face she said I should think you WOULD have been a bad
hand at it

He laughed ruefully I think its the noise though Im ashamed to
say it You see its a very powerful machine and theres a sort of
rhythmical crashinga crash every time the jaws bite off a circle

How often is that

The thing should make about sixtyeight disks a minutea little more
than one a second

And youre close to it

Oh the workman has to sit in its lap he said turning to her more
gaily The others dont mind You see its something wrong with me I
have an idiotic way of flinching from the confounded thingI flinch and
duck a little every time the crash comes and I couldnt get over it I
was a treat to the other workmen in that room theyll be glad to see me
back They used to laugh at me all day long

Marys gaze was averted from Bibbs now she sat with her elbow resting
on the arm of the chair her lifted hand pressed against her cheek She
was staring at the wall and her eyes had a burning brightness in them

It doesnt seem possible any one could do that to you she said in a
low voice No Hes not kind He ought to be proud to help you to the
leisure to write books it should be his greatest privilege to have them
published for you

Cant you SEE him Bibbs interrupted a faint ripple of hilarity in
his voice If he could understand what youre sayingand if you can
imagine his taking such a notion hed have had R T Bloss put up
posters all over the country Read B Sheridan Read the Poet with a
Punch No Its just as well he never got theBut whats the use Ive
never written anything worth printing and I never shall

You could she said

Thats because youve never seen the poor little things Ive tried to
do

You wouldnt let me but I KNOW you could Ah its a pity

It isnt said BIBBS honestly I never couldbut youre the kindest
lady in this world Miss Vertrees

She gave him a flashing glance and it was as kind as he said she was
That sounds wrong she said impulsively I mean Miss Vertrees
Ive thought of you by your first name ever since I met you Wouldnt
you rather call me Mary

Bibbs was dazzled he drew a long deep breath and did not speak

Wouldnt you she asked without a trace of coquetry

If I CAN he said in a low voice

Ah thats very pretty she laughed Youre such an honest person
its pleasant to have you gallant sometimes by way of variety She
became grave again immediately I hear myself laughing as if it were
some one else It sounds like laughter on the eve of a great calamity
She got up restlessly crossed the room and leaned against the wall
facing him Youve GOT to go back to that place

He nodded

And the other time you did it

Just over it said Bibbs Two years But I dont mind the prospect of
a repetition so much as

So much as what she prompted as he stopped

Bibbs looked up at her shyly I want to say it butbut I come to a
dead balk when I try I

Go on Say it whatever it is she bade him You wouldnt know how to
say anything I shouldnt like

I doubt if youd either like or dislike what I want to say he
returned moving uncomfortably in his chair and looking at his feethe
seemed to feel awkward thoroughly You see all my lifeuntil I met
youif I ever felt like saying anything I wrote it instead Saying
things is a new trick for me and thiswell its just this I used to
feel as if I hadnt ever had any sort of a life at all Id never been
of use to anything or anybody and Id never had anything myself
except a kind of haphazard thinking But now its differentIm still
of no use to anybody and I dont see any prospect of being useful
but I have had something for myself Ive had a beautiful and happy
experience and it makes my life seem to beI mean Im glad Ive lived
it Thats all its your letting me be near you sometimes as you have
this strange beautiful happy little while

He did not once look up and reached silence at the end of what he had
to say with his eyes still awkwardly regarding his feet She did not
speak but a soft rustling of her garments let him know that she had
gone back to her chair again The house was still the shabby old room
was so quiet that the sound of a creaking in the wall seemed sharp and
loud

And yet when Mary spoke at last her voice was barely audible If you
think it has beenhappyto be friends with meyoud want toto make
it last

Yes said Bibbs as faintly

Youd want to go on being my friend as long as we live wouldnt you

Yes he gulped

But you make that kind of speech to me because you think its over

He tried to evade her Oh a daylaborer cant come in his overalls

No she interrupted with a sudden sharpness You said what you did
because you think the shops going to kill you

No no

Yes you do think that She rose to her feet again and came and stood
before him Or you think its going to send you back to the sanitarium
Dont deny it Bibbs There See how easily I call you that You see Im
a friend or I couldnt do it Well if you meant what you saidand you
did mean it I know ityoure not going to go back to the sanitarium
The shop shant hurt you It shant

And now Bibbs looked up She stood before him straight and tall
splendid in generous strength her eyes shining and wet

If I mean THAT much to you she cried they cant harm you Go
back to the shopbut come to me when your days work is done Let the
machines crash their sixtyeight times a minute but remember each crash
that deafens you is that much nearer the evening and me

He stumbled to his feet You say he gasped

Every evening dear Bibbs

He could only stare bewildered

EVERY evening I want you They shant hurt you again And she held
out her hand to him it was strong and warm in his tremulous clasp If
I could Id go and feed the strips of zinc to the machine with you
she said But all day long Ill send my thoughts to you You must keep
remembering that your friend stands beside you And when the work is
donewont the night make up for the day

Light seemed to glow from her he was blinded by that radiance
of kindness But all he could say was huskily To think youre
therewith mestanding beside the old zinceater

And they laughed and looked at each other and at last Bibbs found what
it meant not to be alone in the world He had a friend



CHAPTER XX

When he came into the New House a few minutes later he found his
father sitting alone by the library fire Bibbs went in and stood before
him Im cured father he said When do I go back to the shop Im
ready

The desolate and grim old man did not relax I was sittin up to give
you a last chance to say something like that I reckon its about time
I just wanted to see if youd have manhood enough not to make me take
you over there by the collar Last night I made up my mind Id give you
just one more day Well you got to it before I didpretty close to
the eleventh hour All right Start in tomorrow Its the first o the
month Think you can get up in time

Six oclock Bibbs responded briskly And I want to tell youIm
going in a cheerful spirit As you said Ill go and Ill like it

Thats YOUR lookout his father grunted Theyll put you back on the
clippinmachine You get nine dollars a week

More than Im worth too said Bibbs cheerily That reminds me I
didnt mean YOU by Midas in that nonsense Id been writing I meant

Makes a hell of a lot o difference what you meant

I just wanted you to know Good night father

Gnight

The sound of the young mans footsteps ascending the stairs became
inaudible and the house was quiet But presently as Sheridan sat
staring angrily at the fire the shuffling of a pair of slippers could
be heard descending and Mrs Sheridan made her appearance her oblique
expression and the state of her toilette being those of a person who
after trying unsuccessfully to sleep on one side has got up to look for
burglars

Papa she exclaimed drowsily Whynt you go to bed It must be
goin on leven oclock

She yawned and seated herself near him stretching out her hands to
the fire Whats the matter she asked sleep and anxiety striving
sluggishly with each other in her voice I knew you were worried all
dinnertime You got something new on your mind besides Jims bein
taken away like he was Whats worryin you now papa

Nothin

She jeered feebly N tell ME that You sat up to see Bibbs didnt
you

He starts in at the shop again tomorrow morning said Sheridan

Just the same as he did before

Just preCISELY

Howhow long you goin to keep him at it papa she asked timidly

Until he KNOWS something The unhappy man struck his palms together
then got to his feet and began to pace the room as was his wont when he
talked Hell go back to the machine he couldnt learn to tend properly
in the six months he was there and hell stick to it till he DOES learn
it Do you suppose that lummix ever asked himself WHY I want him to
learn it No And I aint agoin to tell him either When he went
there I had em set him on the simplest machine we gotand he stuck
there How much prospect would there be of his learnin to run the whole
business if he cant run the easiest machine in it I sent him there
to make him THOROUGH And what happened He didnt LIKE it That boys
whole life theres been a settin up o something mulish thats against
everything I want him to do I dont know what it is but its got to be
worked out of him Now labor aint any more a simple question than what
it was when we were young My idea is that outside o union troubles
the man that can manage workinmen is the man thats been one himself
Well I set Bibbs to learn the men and to learn the business and HE
set himself to balk on the first job Thats what he did and the balks
lasted close on to three years If he balks again Im just done with
him Sometimes I feel like I was pretty near done with everything
anyhow

I knew there was something else said Mrs Sheridan blinking over
a yawn You better let it go till tomorrow and get to bed nowless
youll tell me

Suppose something happened to Roscoe he said THEN whatd I have to
look forward to THEN what could I depend on to hold things together A
lummix A lummix that hasnt learned how to push a strip o zinc along a
groove

Roscoe she yawned You neednt worry about Roscoe papa Hes the
strongest child we had I never did know anybody keep better health than
he does I dont believe hes even had a cold in five years You better
go up to bed papa

Suppose something DID happen to him though You dont know what it
means keepin property together these daysjust keepin it ALIVE let
alone makin it grow the way I do Ive seen too many estates hacked
away in chunks big and little I tell you when a man dies the wolves
come out o the woods pack after pack to see what they can tear off
for themselves and if that dead mans chuldern aint on the job night
and day everything he builtll get carried off Carried off Ive seen
a big fortune behave like an ashbarrel in a cyclonethere wasnt even
a dustheap left to tell where it stood Ive seen it time and again
My Lord when I think o such things comin to ME It dont seem like
I deserved itno man ever tried harder to raise his boys right than I
have I planned and planned and planned how to bring em up to be guards
to drive the wolves off and how to be builders to build and build
bigger I tell you this business life is no fools job nowadaysa mans
got to have eyes in the back of his head You hear talk sometimes d
make you think the millennium had comebut right the next breath youll
hear somebody hollerin about the great unrest You BET theres a
great unrest There aint any man alive smart enough to see what its
goin to do to us in the end nor what day its got set to bust loose
but its frothin and bubblin in the boiler This countrys been
fillin up with it from all over the world for a good many years and
the old campmeetin days are dead and done with Church aint what it
used to be Nothins what it used to beeverythings turned up from the
bottom and the growth is so big the roots stick out in the air Theres
an awful ruction goin on and you got to keep hoppin if youre goin
to keep your balance on the top of it And the schemers They run like
bugs on the bottom of a boardafter any piece o money they hear is
loose Fool schemes and crooked schemes the fool ones are the most and
the worst You got to FIGHT to keep your money after youve made it And
the woods are full o mighty industrious men thats got only one motto
Get the other fellows money before he gets yours And when a mans
built as I have when hes built good and strong and made good things
grow and prosperTHOSE are the fellows that lay for the chance to slide
in and sneak the benefit of it and put their names to it And whats
the use of my havin ever been born if such a thing as that is goin
to happen Whats the use of my havin worked my life and soul into my
business if its all goin to be dispersed and scattered soon as Im in
the ground

He strode up and down the long room gesticulatinglittle regarding
the troubled and drowsy figure by the fireside His throat rumbled
thunderously the words came with stormy bitterness You think this is
a time for young men to be lyin on beds of ease I tell you there never
was such a time before there never was such opportunity The sluggard
is despoiled while he sleepsyes by George if a man lays down theyll
eat him before he wakesbut the live man can build straight up till
he touches the sky This is the business mans day it used to be the
soldiers day and the statesmans day but this is OURS And it aint a
Sunday to go fishinits turmoil turmoiland you got to go out and
live it and breathe it and MAKE it yourself or youll only be a dead
man walkin around dreamin youre alive And thats what my son Bibbs
has been doin all his life and what hed rather do now than go out and
do his part by me And if anything happens to Roscoe

Oh do stop worryin over such nonsense Mrs Sheridan interrupted
irritated into sharp wakefulness for the moment There isnt anything
goin to happen to Roscoe and youre just tormentin yourself about
nothin Arent you EVER goin to bed

Sheridan halted All right mamma he said with a vast sigh Lets
go up And he snapped off the electric light leaving only the rosy
glow of the fire

Did you speak to Roscoe she yawned rising lopsidedly in her
drowsiness Did you mention about what I told you the other evening

No I will tomorrow


But Roscoe did not come downtown the next day nor the next nor did
Sheridan see fit to enter his sons house He waited Then on the
fourth day of the month Roscoe walked into his fathers office at nine
in the morning when Sheridan happened to be alone

They told me downstairs youd left word you wanted to see me

Sit down said Sheridan rising

Roscoe sat His father walked close to him sniffed suspiciously and
then walked away smiling bitterly Boh he exclaimed Still at it

Yes said Roscoe Ive had a couple of drinks this morning What
about it

I reckon I better adopt some decent young man his father returned
Id bring Bibbs up here and put him in your place if he was fit I
would

Better do it Roscoe assented sullenly

Whend you begin this thing

I always did drink a little Ever since I grew up that is

Leave that talk out You know what I mean

Well I dont know as I ever had too much in office hoursuntil the
other day

Sheridan began cutting Its a lie Ive had Ray Wills up from your
office He didnt want to give you away but I put the hooks into him
and he came through You were drunk twice before and couldnt work You
been leavin your office for drinks every few hours for the last three
weeks I been over your books Your office is way behind You havent
done any work to count in a month

All right said Roscoe drooping under the torture Its all true

What you goin to do about it

Roscoes head was sunk between his shoulders I cant stand very much
talk about it father he said pleadingly

No Sheridan cried Neither can I What do you think it means to ME
He dropped into the chair at his big desk groaning I cant stand to
talk about it any moren you can to listen but Im goin to find out
whats the matter with you and Im goin to straighten you out

Roscoe shook his head helplessly

You cant straighten me out

See here said Sheridan Can you go back to your office and stay
sober today while I get my work done or will I have to hire a couple
o huskies to follow you around and knock the whiskey out o your hand
if they see you tryin to take it

You neednt worry about that said Roscoe looking up with a faint
resentment Im not drinking because Ive got a thirst

Well what have you got

Nothing Nothing you can do anything about Nothing I tell you

Well see about that said Sheridan harshly Now I cant fool with
you today and you get up out o that chair and get out o my
office You bring your wife to dinner tomorrow You didnt come last
Sundaybut you come tomorrow Ill talk this out with you when the
womenfolks are workin the phonograph after dinner Can you keep sober
till then You better be sure because Im going to send Abercrombie
down to your office every little while and hell let me know

Roscoe paused at the door You told Abercrombie about it he asked

TOLD him And Sheridan laughed hideously Do you suppose theres an
elevatorboy in the whole dam building that aint on to you

Roscoe settled his hat down over his eyes and went out



CHAPTER XXI

 WHO looks a mustang in the eye
 Changety chang chang Bash Crash BANG

So sang Bibbs his musical gaieties inaudible to his fellowworkmen
because of the noise of the machinery He had discovered long ago that
the uproar was rhythmical and it had been intolerable but now on the
afternoon of the fourth day of his return he was accompanying the
swing and clash of the metals with jubilant vaquero fragments mingling
improvisations of his own among them and mocking the zinceaters crash
with vocal imitations

 Fearless and bold
 Chang Bash Behold
 With a leap from the ground
 To the saddle in a bound
 And awayand away
 HiYAY
 WHO looks a chang chang bash crash bang
 WHO cares a dash how you bash and you crash
 NIGHTS on the way
 EACH time I say
 HiYAY
 Crash chang Bash chang Chang bang BANG

The long room was ceaselessly thundering with metallic sound the
air was thick with the smell of oil the floor trembled perpetually
everything was implacably in motionnowhere was there a rest for the
dizzied eye The first time he had entered the place Bibbs had become
dizzy instantly and six months of it had only added increasing nausea
to faintness But he felt neither now ALL DAY LONG ILL SEND MY
THOUGHTS TO YOU YOU MUST KEEP REMEMBERING THAT YOUR FRIEND STANDS
BESIDE YOU He saw her there beside him and the greasy roaring place
became suffused with radiance The poet was happy in his machineshop
he was still a poet there And he fed his old zinceater and sang

 Awayand away
 HiYAY
 Crash bash crash bash CHANG
 Wild are his eyes
 Fiercely he dies
 HiYAH
 Crash bash bang Bash CHANG
 Ready to fling
 Our gloves in the ring

He was unaware of a sensation that passed along the lines of workmen
Their great master had come among them and they grinned to see him
standing with Dr Gurney behind the unconscious Bibbs Sheridan nodded
to those nearest himhe had personal acquaintance with nearly all of
thembut he kept his attention upon his son Bibbs worked steadily
never turning from his machine Now and then he varied his musical
programme with remarks addressed to the zinceater

Go on you old crashbasher Chew it up Its good for you if
you dont try to bolt your vittles Fletcherize you pig Thats
rightYOULL never get a lump in your gizzard Want some more Heres a
nice shiny one

The words were indistinguishable but Sheridan inclined his head to
Gurneys ear and shouted fiercely Talkin to himself By George

Gurney laughed reassuringly and shook his head

Bibbs returned to song

 Chang Chang bash chang Its I
 WHO looks a mustang in the eye
 Fearless and bo

His father grasped him by the arm Here he shouted Let ME show you
how to run a strip through there The foreman says youre some bettern
you used to be but thats no way to handleGet out the way and let me
show you once

Better be careful Bibbs warned him stepping to one side

Careful Boh Sheridan seized a strip of zinc from the box What
you talkin to yourself about Tryin to make yourself think youre so
abused youre goin wrong in the head

Abused No shouted Bibbs I was SINGINGbecause I like it I
told you Id come back and like it

Sheridan may not have understood At all events he made no reply
but began to run the strip of zinc through the machine He did it
awkwardlyand with bad results

Here he shouted This is the way Watch how I do it Theres nothin
to it if you put your mind on it By his own showing then his mind was
not upon it He continued to talk All you got to look out for is to
keep it pressed over to

Dont run your hand up with it Bibbs vociferated leaning toward him

Run nothin You GOT to

Look out shouted Bibbs and Gurney together and they both sprang
forward But Sheridans right hand had followed the strip too far and
the zinceater had bitten off the tips of the first and second fingers
He swore vehemently and wrung his hand sending a shower of red drops
over himself and Bibbs but Gurney grasped his wrist and said sharply

Come out of here Come over to the lavatory in the office Bibbs fetch
my bag Its in my machine outside

And when Bibbs brought the bag to the washroom he found the doctor
still grasping Sheridans wrist holding the injured hand over a basin
Sheridan had lost color and temper too He glared over his shoulder at
his son as the latter handed the bag to Gurney

You go on back to your work he said Ive had worse snips than that
from a pencilsharpener

Oh no you havent said Gurney

I have too Sheridan retorted angrily Bibbs you go on back to
your work Theres no reason to stand around here watchin ole Doc
Gurney tryin to keep himself awake workin on a scratch that only needs
a little courtplaster I slipped or it wouldnt happened You get back
on your job

All right said Bibbs

HERE Sheridan bellowed as his son was passing out of the door
You watch out when youre runnin that machine You hear what I say I
slipped or I wouldnt got scratched but youYOURE liable to get your
whole hand cut off You keep your eyes open

Yes sir And Bibbs returned to the zinceater thoughtfully

Half an hour later Gurney touched him on the shoulder and beckoned him
outside where conversation was possible I sent him home Bibbs Hell
have to be careful of that hand Go get your overalls off Ill take you
for a drive and leave you at home

Cant said Bibbs Got to stick to my job till the whistle blows

No you dont the doctor returned smothering a yawn He wants me to
take you down to my office and give you an overhauling to see how much
harm these four days on the machine have done you I guess you folks
have got that old man pretty thoroughly upset between you up at your
house But I dont need to go over you I can see with my eyes half
shut

Yes Bibbs interrupted thats what they are

I say I can see youre starting out at least in good shape Whats
made the difference

I like the machine said Bibbs Ive made a friend of it I serenade
it and talk to it and then it talks back to me

Indeed indeed What does it say

What I want to hear

Well well The doctor stretched himself and stamped his foot
repeatedly Better come along and take a drive with me You can take
the time off that he allowed for the examination and

Not at all said Bibbs Im going to stand by my old zinceater till
five oclock I tell you I LIKE it

Then I suppose thats the end of your wanting to write

I dont know about that Bibbs said thoughtfully but the zinceater
doesnt interfere with my thinking at least Its better than being
in business Im sure of that I dont want anything to change Id be
content to lead just the life Im leading now to the end of my days

You do beat the devil exclaimed Gurney Your fathers right when he
tells me youre a mystery Perhaps the Almighty knew what He was doing
when He made you but it takes a lot of faith to believe it Well Im
off Go on back to your murdering old machine He climbed into his car
which he operated himself but he refrained from setting it immediately
in motion Well I rubbed it in on the old man that you had warned him
not to slide his hand along too far and that he got hurt because he
didnt pay attention to your warning and because he was trying to show
you how to do something you were already doing a great deal better
than he could You tell him Ill be around to look at it and change the
dressing tomorrow morning Goodby

But when he paid the promised visit the next morning he did more than
change the dressing upon the damaged hand The injury was severe of
its kind and Gurney spent a long time over it though Sheridan was
rebellious and scornful being brought to a degree of tractability
only by means of horrible threats and talk of amputation However he
appeared at the dinnertable with his hand supported in a sling which
he seemed to regard as an indignity while the natural inquiries upon
the subject evidently struck him as deliberate insults Mrs Sheridan
having been unable to contain her solicitude several times during the
day and having been checked each time in a manner that blanched her
cheek hastened to warn Roscoe and Sibyl upon their arrival at five to
omit any reference to the injury and to avoid even looking at the sling
if they possibly could

The Sheridans dined on Sundays at five Sibyl had taken pains not to
arrive either before or after the hand was precisely on the hour
and the members of the family were all seated at the table within two
minutes after she and Roscoe had entered the house

It was a glum gathering overhung with portents The air seemed charged
awaiting any tiny ignition to explode and Mrs Sheridans expression
as she sat with her eyes fixed almost continually upon her husband was
that of a person engaged in prayer Edith was pale and intent
Roscoe looked ill Sibyl looked ill and Sheridan looked both ill and
explosive Bibbs had more color than any of these and there was a
strange brightness like a light upon his face It was curious to see
anything so happy in the tense gloom of that household

Edith ate little but gazed nearly all the time at her plate She never
once looked at Sibyl though Sibyl now and then gave her a quick glance
heavily charged and then looked away Roscoe ate nothing and like
Edith kept his eyes upon his plate and made believe to occupy himself
with the viands thereon loading his fork frequently but not lifting
it to his mouth He did not once look at his father though his father
gazed heavily at him most of the time And between Edith and Sibyl and
between Roscoe and his father some bitter wireless communication seemed
continually to be taking place throughout the long silences prevailing
during this enlivening ceremony of Sabbath refection

Didnt you go to church this morning Bibbs his mother asked in the
effort to break up one of those ghastly intervals

What did you say mother

Didnt you go to church this morning

I think so he answered as from a roseate trance

You THINK so Dont you know

Oh yes Yes I went to church

Which one

Just down the street Its brick

What was the sermon about

What mother

Cant you hear me she cried I asked you what the sermon was about

He roused himself I think it was about He frowned seeming to
concentrate his will to recollect I think it was about something in
the Bible

Whitejacket George was glad of an opportunity to leave the room and
lean upon Mist Jacksons shoulder in the pantry He dont know they
WAS any suhmon he concluded having narrated the diningroom dialogue
All he know is he was with at lady lives nex do George was right

Did you go to church all by yourself Bibbs Sibyl asked

No he answered No I didnt go alone

Oh Sibyl gave the ejaculation an upward twist as of mocking inquiry
and followed it by another expressive of hilarious comprehension OH

Bibbs looked at her studiously but she spoke no further And that
completed the conversation at the lugubrious feast

Coffee came finally was disposed of quickly and the party dispersed to
other parts of the house Bibbs followed his father and Roscoe into the
library but was not well received

YOU go and listen to the phonograph with the womenfolks Sheridan
commanded

Bibbs retreated Sometimes you do seem to be a hard sort of man he
said

However he went obediently to the giltandbrocade room in which his
mother and his sister and his sisterinlaw had helplessly withdrawn
according to their Sabbatical custom Edith sat in a corner tapping her
feet together and looking at them Sibyl sat in the center of the room
examining a brooch which she had detached from her throat and Mrs
Sheridan was looking over a collection of records consisting exclusively
of Caruso and ragtime She selected one of the latter remarking that
she thought it right pretty and followed it with one of the former
and the same remark

As the second reached its conclusion George appeared in the broad
doorway seeming to have an errand there but he did not speak Instead
he favored Edith with a benevolent smile and she immediately left
the room George stepping aside for her to precede him and then
disappearing after her in the hall with an air of successful diplomacy
He made it perfectly clear that Edith had given him secret instructions
and that it had been his pride and pleasure to fulfil them to the
letter

Sibyl stiffened in her chair her lips parted and she watched with
curious eyes the vanishing back of the white jacket

Whats that she asked in a low voice but sharply

Heres another right pretty record said Mrs Sheridan
affectingwith patent nervousnessnot to hear And she unloosed the
music

Sibyl bit her lip and began to tap her chin with the brooch After a
little while she turned to Bibbs who reposed at halflength in a gold
chair with his eyes closed

Where did Edith go she asked curiously

Edith he repeated opening his eyes blankly Is she gone

Sibyl got up and stood in the doorway She leaned against the casing
still tapping her chin with the brooch Her eyes were dilating she was
suddenly at high tension and her expression had become one of sharp
excitement She listened intently

When the record was spun out she could hear Sheridan rumbling in the
library during the ensuing silence and Roscoes voice querulous and
husky I wont say anything at all I tell you you might just as well
let me alone

But there were other sounds a rustling and murmur whispering low
protesting cadences in a male voice And as Mrs Sheridan started
another record a sudden vital resolve leaped like fire in the eyes of
Sibyl She walked down the hall and straight into the smokingroom

Lamhorn and Edith both sprang to their feet separating Edith became
instantly deathly white with a rage that set her shaking from head to
foot and Lamhorn stuttered as he tried to speak

But Ediths shaking was not so violent as Sibyls nor was her face so
white At sight of them and of their embrace all possible consequences
became nothing to Sibyl She courtesied holding up her skirts and
contorting her lips to the semblance of a smile

Sit just as you wereboth of you she said And then to Edith Did
you tell my husband I had been telephoning to Lamhorn

You march out of here said Edith fiercely March straight out of
here

Sibyl leveled a forefinger at Lamhorn

Did you tell her Id been telephoning you I wanted you to come

Oh good God Lamhorn said Hush

You knew shed tell my husband DIDNT you she cried You knew
that

HUSH he begged panicstricken

That was a MANLY thing to do Oh it was like a gentleman You wouldnt
comeyou wouldnt even come for five minutes to hear what I had to say
You were TIRED of what I had to say Youd heard it all a thousand times
before and you wouldnt come No No NO she stormed You wouldnt
even come for five minutes but you could tell that little cat And SHE
told my husband Youre a MAN

Edith saw in a flash that the consequences of battle would be ruinous to
Sibyl and the furious girl needed no further temptation to give way
to her feelings Get out of this house she shrieked This is my
fathers house Dont you dare speak to Robert like that

No No I mustnt SPEAK

Dont you DARE

Edith and Sibyl began to scream insults at each other simultaneously
fronting each other their furious faces close Their voices shrilled
and rose and crackedthey screeched They could be heard over the noise
of the phonograph which was playing a brassband selection They could
be heard all over the house They were heard in the kitchen they could
have been heard in the cellar Neither of them cared for that

You told my husband screamed Sibyl bringing her face still closer to
Ediths You told my husband This man put THAT in your hands to strike
me with HE did

Ill tell your husband again Ill tell him everything I know Its
TIME your husband

They were swept asunder by a bandaged hand Do you want the neighbors
in Sheridan thundered

There fell a shocking silence Frenzied Sibyl saw her husband and his
mother in the doorway and she understood what she had done She moved
slowly toward the door then suddenly she began to run She ran into the
hall and through it and out of the house Roscoe followed her heavily
his eyes on the ground

NOW THEN said Sheridan to Lamhorn

The words were indefinite but the voice was not Neither was the
vicious gesture of the bandaged hand which concluded its orbit in the
direction of the door in a manner sufficient for the swift dispersal of
George and Jackson and several female servants who hovered behind Mrs
Sheridan They fled lightly

Papa papa wailed Mrs Sheridan Look at your hand Youd oughtnt
to been so rough with Edie you hurt your hand on her shoulder Look

There was in fact a spreading red stain upon the bandages at the tips
of the fingers and Sheridan put his hand back in the sling Now then
he repeated You goin to leave my house

He will NOT sobbed Edith Dont you DARE order him out

Dont you bother dear said Lamhorn quietly He doesnt understand
YOU mustnt be troubled Pallor was becoming to him he looked very
handsome and as he left the room he seemed in the girls distraught
eyes a persecuted noble indifferent to the rabble yawping insult at his
heelsthe rabble being enacted by her father

Dont come back either said Sheridan realistic in this
impersonation Keep off the premises he called savagely into the
hall This familys through with you

It is NOT Edith cried breaking from her mother Youll SEE about
that Youll find out Youll find out whatll happen Whats HE done
I guess if I can stand it its none of YOUR business is it Whats
HE done Id like to know You dont know anything about it Dont you
spose he told ME She was crazy about him soon as he began going there
and he flirted with her a little Thats everything he did and it
was before he met ME After that he wouldnt and it wasnt anything
anywayhe never was serious a minute about it SHE wanted it to be
serious and she was bound she wouldnt give him up He told her long
ago he cared about me but she kept persecuting him and

Yes said Sheridan sternly thats HIS side of it Thatll do He
doesnt come in this house again

You look out Edith cried

Yes Ill look out Id a told you today he wasnt to be allowed on
the premises but I had other things on my mind I had Abercrombie
look up this young man privately and hes no count Hes no count
on earth Hes no good Hes NOTHIN But it wouldnt matter if he was
George Washington after whats happened and what Ive heard tonight

But papa Mrs Sheridan began if Edie says it was all Sibyls
fault makin up to him and he never encouraged her much nor

S enough he roared He keeps off these premises And if any of you
so much as ever speak his name to me again

But Edith screamed clapping her hands over her ears to shut out the
sound of his voice and ran upstairs sobbing loudly followed by her
mother However Mrs Sheridan descended a few minutes later and joined
her husband in the library Bibbs still sitting in his gold chair saw
her pass roused himself from reverie and strolled in after her

She locked her door said Mrs Sheridan shaking her head woefully
She wouldnt even answer me They wasnt a sound from her room

Well said her husband she can settle her mind to it She
never speaks to that fellow again and if he tries to telephone her
tomorrowHere You tell the help if he calls up to ring off and say
its my orders No you neednt Ill tell em myself

Better not said Bibbs gently

His father glared at him

Its no good said Bibbs Mother when you were in love with
father

My goodness she cried You aint agoin to compare your father to
that

Edith feels about him just what you did about father said Bibbs And
if YOUR father had told you

I wont LISTEN to such silly talk she declared angrily

So youre handin out your advice are you Bibbs said Sheridan
What is it

Let her see him all she wants

Youre a Sheridan gave it up I dont know what to call you

Let her see him all she wants Bibbs repeated thoughtfully Youre
up against something too strong for you If Edith were a weakling
youd have a chance this way but she isnt Shes got a lot of your
determination father and with whats going on inside of her shell
beat you You cant keep her from seeing him as long as she feels about
him the way she does now You cant make her think less of him either
Nobody can Your only chance is that shell do it for herself and if
you give her time and go easy she probably will Marriage would do it
for her quickest but thats just what you dont want and as you DONT
want it youd better

I cant stand any more Sheridan burst out If its come to BIBBS
advisin me how to run this house I better resign Mamma wheres that
nigger George Maybe HES got some plan how I better manage my family
Bibbs for Gods sake go and lay down Let her see him all she wants
Oh Lord heres wisdom heres

Bibbs said Mrs Sheridan if you havent got anything to do you
might step over and take Sibyls wraps homeshe left em in the hall I
dont think you seem to quiet your poor father very much just now

All right And Bibbs bore Sibyls wraps across the street and
delivered them to Roscoe who met him at the door Bibbs said only
Forgot these and Good night Roscoe cordially and cheerfully and
returned to the New House His mother and father were still talking in
the library but with discretion he passed rapidly on and upward to his
own room and there he proceeded to write in his notebook



CHAPTER XXII

 There seems to be another curious thing about Love Bibbs wrote
 Love is blind while it lives and only opens its eyes and becomes
 very wide awake when it dies Let it alone until then

 You cannot reason with love or with any other passion The wise
 will not wish for lovenor for ambition These are passions
 and bring others in their trainhatreds and jealousiesall
 blind Friendship and a quiet heart for the wise

 What a turbulence is love It is dangerous for a blind thing to
 be turbulent there are precipices in life One would not cross
 a mountainpass with a thick cloth over his eyes Lovers do
 Friendship walks gently and with open eyes

 To walk to church with a friend To sit beside her there To rise
 when she rises and to touch with ones thumb and fingers the other
 half of the hymnbook that she holds What lover with his fierce
 ways could know this transcendent happiness

 Friendship brings everything that heaven could bring There is no
 labor that cannot become a living rapture if you know that a friend
 is thinking of you as you labor So you sing at your work For
 the work is part of the thoughts of your friend so you love it

 Love is demanding and claiming and insistent Friendship is all
 kindnessit makes the world glorious with kindness What color
 you see when you walk with a friend You see that the gray sky
 is brilliant and shimmering you see that the smoke has warm
 browns and is marvelously sculpturedthe air becomes iridescent
 You see the gold in brown hair Light floods everything

 When you walk to church with a friend you know that life can give
 you nothing richer You pray that there will be no change in
 anything for ever

 What an adorable thing it is to discover a little foible in your
 friend a bit of vanity that gives you one thing more about her to
 adore On a cold morning she will perhaps walk to church with you
 without her furs and she will blush and return an evasive answer
 when you ask her why she does not wear them You will say no
 more because you understand She looks beautiful in her furs
 you love their darkness against her cheek but you comprehend that
 they conceal the loveliness of her throat and the fine line of her
 chin and that she also has comprehended this and wishing to
 look still more bewitching discards her furs at the risk of
 taking cold So you hold your peace and try to look as if you
 had not thought it out

 This theory is satisfactory except that it does not account for
 the absence of the muff Ah well there must always be a mystery
 somewhere Mystery is a part of enchantment

 Manual labor is best Your heart can sing and your mind can dream
 while your hands are working You could not have a singing heart
 and a dreaming mind all day if you had to scheme out dollars
 or if you had to add columns of figures Those things take your
 attention You cannot be thinking of your friend while you write
 letters beginning Yours of the 17th inst recd and contents
 duly noted But to work with your hands all day thinking and
 singing and then after nightfall to hear the ineffable kindness
 of your friends greetingalways therefor you Who would wake
 from such a dream as this

 Dawn and the seamusic in moonlit gardensnightingales
 serenading through almondgroves in bloomwhat could bring such
 things into the citys turmoil Yet they are here and roses
 blossom in the soot That is what it means not to be alone
 That is what a friend gives you

Having thus demonstrated that he was about twentyfive and had formed a
somewhat indefinite definition of friendship but one entirely his own
and perhaps Marys Bibbs went to bed and was the only Sheridan to
sleep soundly through the night and to wake at dawn with a light heart

His cheerfulness was vaguely diminished by the troublous state of
affairs of his family He had recognized his condition when he wrote
Who would wake from such a dream as this Bibbs was a sympathetic
person easily touched but he was indeed living in a dream and all
things outside of it were veiled and remotefor that is the way of
youth in a dream And Bibbs who had never before been of any age
either old or young had come to his youth at last

He went whistling from the house before even his father had come
downstairs There was a fog outdoors saturated with a fine powder of
soot and though Bibbs noticed absently the dim shape of an automobile
at the curb before Roscoes house he did not recognize it as Dr
Gurneys but went cheerily on his way through the dingy mist And when
he was once more installed beside his faithful zinceater he whistled
and sang to it as other workmen did to their own machines sometimes
when things went well His comrades in the shop glanced at him amusedly
now and then They liked him and he ate his lunch at noon with a group
of Socialists who approved of his ideas and talked of electing him to
their association

The short days of the year had come and it was dark before the whistles
blew When the signal came Bibbs went to the office where he divested
himself of his overallshis single divergence from the routine of his
fellowworkmenand after that he used soap and water copiously This
was his transformation scene he passed into the office a rather frail
young workingman noticeably begrimed and passed out of it to the
pavement a cheerfully preoccupied sample of gentry fastidious to the
point of elegance

The sidewalk was crowded with the bearers of dinnerpails men and
boys and women and girls from the workrooms that closed at five Many
hurried and some loitered they went both east and west jostling one
another and Bibbs turning his face homeward was forced to go slowly

Coming toward him as slowly through the crowd a tall girl caught
sight of his long thin figure and stood still until he had almost
passed her for in the thick crowd and the thicker gloom he did not
recognize her though his shoulder actually touched hers He would have
gone by but she laughed delightedly and he stopped short startled
Two boys one chasing the other swept between them and Bibbs stood
still peering about him in deep perplexity She leaned toward him

I knew YOU she said

Good heavens cried Bibbs I thought it was your voice coming out of
a star

Theres only smoke overhead said Mary and laughed again There
arent any stars

Oh yes there werewhen you laughed

She took his arm and they went on Ive come to walk home with you
Bibbs I wanted to

But were you here in the

In the dark Yes Waiting Yes

Bibbs was radiant he felt suffocated with happiness He began to scold
her

But its not safe and Im not worth it You shouldnt haveyou ought
to know better What did

I only waited about twelve seconds she laughed Id just got here

But to come all this way and to this part of town in the dark you

I was in this part of town already she said At least I was only
seven or eight blocks away and it was dark when I came out and Id
have had to go home aloneand I preferred going home with you

Its pretty beautiful for me said Bibbs with a deep breath Youll
never know what it was to hear your laugh in the darknessand then
toto see you standing there Oh it was likeit was likehow can I
TELL you what it was like They had passed beyond the crowd now and
a crossinglamp shone upon them which revealed the fact that again she
was without her furs Here was a puzzle Why did that adorable little
vanity of hers bring her out without them in the DARK But of course she
had gone out long before dark For undefinable reasons this explanation
was not quite satisfactory however allowing it to stand his
solicitude for her took another turn I think you ought to have a car
he said especially when you want to be out after dark You need one in
winter anyhow Have you ever asked your father for one

No said Mary I dont think Id care for one particularly

I wish you would Bibbss tone was earnest and troubled I think in
winter you

No no she interrupted lightly I dont need

But my mother tried to insist on sending one over here every afternoon
for me I wouldnt let her because I like the walk but a girl

A girl likes to walk too said Mary Let me tell you where Ive been
this afternoon and how I happened to be near enough to make you take me
home Ive been to see a little old man who makes pictures of the smoke
He has a sort of warehouse for a studio and he lives there with his
mother and his wife and their seven children and hes gloriously happy
Id seen one of his pictures at an exhibition and I wanted to see
more of them so he showed them to me He has almost everthing he ever
painted I dont suppose hes sold more than four or five pictures in
his life He gives drawinglessons to keep alive

How do you mean he paints the smoke Bibbs asked

Literally He paints from his studio window and from the
streetanywhere He just paints whats around himand its beautiful

The smoke

Wonderful He sees the sky through it somehow He does the ugly roofs
of cheap houses through a haze of smoke and he does smoky sunsets and
smoky sunrises and he has other things with the heavy solid slow
columns of smoke going far out and growing more ethereal and mixing
with the hazy light in the distance and he has others with the broken
skyline of downtown all misted with the smoke and puffs and jets of
vapor that have colors like an orchard in midApril Im going to take
you there some Sunday afternoon Bibbs

Youre showing me the town he said I didnt know what was in it at
all

There are workers in beauty here she told him gently There are
other painters more prosperous than my friend There are all sorts of
things

I didnt know

No Since the town began growing so great that it called itself
greater one could live here all ones life and know only the side of
it that shows

The beautyworkers seem buried very deep said Bibbs And I imagine
that your friend who makes the smoke beautiful must be buried deepest
of all My father loves the smoke but I cant imagine his buying one
of your friends pictures Hed buy the Bay of Naples but he wouldnt
get one of those Hed think smoke in a picture was horribleunless he
could use it for an advertisement

Yes she said thoughtfully And really hes the town They ARE
buried pretty deep it seems sometimes Bibbs

And yet its all wonderful he said Its wonderful to me

You mean the town is wonderful to you

Yes because everything is since you called me your friend The city
is only a rumble on the horizon for me It cant come any closer than
the horizon so long as you let me see you standing by my old zinceater
all day long helping me Mary He stopped with a gasp Thats the
first time Ive called you Mary

Yes She laughed a little tremuously Though I wanted you to

I said it without thinking It must be because you came there to walk
home with me That must be it

Women like to have things said Mary informed him her tremulous
laughter continuing Were you glad I came for you

Nonot glad I felt as if I were being carried straight up and up
and upover the clouds I feel like that still I think Im that way
most of the time I wonder what I was like before I knew you The person
I was then seems to have been somebody else not Bibbs Sheridan at
all It seems long long ago I was gloomy and sicklysomebody
elsesomebody I dont understand now a coward afraid of
shadowsafraid of things that didnt existafraid of my old
zinceater And now Im only afraid of what might change anything

She was silent a moment and then Youre happy Bibbs she asked

Ah dont you see he cried I want it to last for a thousand
thousand years just as it is Youve made me so rich Im a miser I
wouldnt have one thing differentnothing nothing

Dear Bibbs she said and laughed happily



CHAPTER XXIII

Bibbs continued to live in the shelter of his dream He had told Edith
after his ineffective effort to be useful in her affairs that he had
decided that he was a member of the family but he appeared to have
relapsed to the retired list after that one attempt at participancyhe
was far enough detached from membership now These were turbulent days
in the New House but Bibbs had no part whatever in the turbulencehe
seemed an absentminded stranger present by accident and not wholly
aware that he was present He would sit faintly smiling over pleasant
imaginings and dear reminiscences of his own while battle raged between
Edith and her father or while Sheridan unloosed jeremiads upon the
sullen Roscoe who drank heavily to endure them The happy dreamer
wandered into stormareas like a somnambulist and wandered out again
unawakened He was sorry for his father and for Roscoe and for Edith
and for Sibyl but their sufferings and outcries seemed far away

Sibyl was under Gurneys care Roscoe had sent for him on Sunday night
not long after Bibbs returned the abandoned wraps and during the first
days of Sibyls illness the doctor found it necessary to be with her
frequently and to install a muscular nurse And whether he would or
no Gurney received from his hysterical patient a variety of pungent
information which would have staggered anybody but a family physician
Among other things he was given to comprehend the change in Bibbs and
why the zinceater was not putting a lump in the operators gizzard as
of yore

Sibyl was not deliriousshe was a thin little ego writhing and
shrieking in pain Life had hurt her and had driven her into hurting
herself her condition was only the adults terrible exaggeration of
that of a child after a bad bruisethere must be screaming and telling
mother all about the hurt and how it happened Sibyl babbled herself
hoarse when Gurney withheld morphine She went from the beginning to the
end in a breath No protest stopped her nothing stopped her

You ought to let me die she wailed Its cruel not to let me die
What harm have I ever done to anybody that you want to keep me alive
Just look at my life I only married Roscoe to get away from home and
look what that got me intolook where I am now He brought me to this
town and what did I have in my life but his FAMILY And they didnt
even know the right crowd If they had it might have been SOMETHING
I had nothingnothingnothing in the world I wanted to have a good
timeand how could I Wheres any good time among these Sheridans They
never even had wine on the table I thought I was marrying into a rich
family where Id meet attractive people Id read about and travel and
go to dancesand oh my Lord all I got was these Sheridans I did
the best I could I did indeed Oh I DID I just tried to live Every
womans got a right to live some time in her life I guess Things were
just beginning to look brighterwed moved up here and that frozen
crowd across the street were after Jim for their daughter and theyd
have started us with the right peopleand then I saw how Edith was
getting him away from me She did it too She got him A girl with
money can do that to a married womanyes she can every time And what
could I do What can any woman do in my fix I couldnt do ANYTHING but
try to stand itand I couldnt stand it I went to that iciclethat
Vertrees girland she could have helped me a little and it wouldnt
have hurt her It wouldnt have done her any harm to help me THAT
little She treated me as if Id been dirt that she wouldnt even take
the trouble to sweep out of her house Let her WAIT

Sibyls voice hoarse from babbling became no more than a husky
whisper though she strove to make it louder She struggled half
upright and the nurse restrained her Id get up out of this bed to
show her she cant do such things to me I was absolutely ladylike and
she walked out and left me there alone Shell SEE She started after
Bibbs before Jims casket was fairly underground and she thinks shes
landed that poor loonbut shell see Shell see If Im ever able
to walk across the street again Ill show her how to treat a woman in
trouble that comes to her for help It wouldnt have hurt her anyit
wouldntit wouldnt And Edith neednt have told what she told
Roscoeit wouldnt have hurt her to let me alone And HE told her I
bored himtelephoning him I wanted to see him He neednt have done
it He needntneednt Her voice grew fainter for that while
with exhaustion though she would go over it all again as soon as her
strength returned She lay panting Then seeing her husband standing
disheveled in the doorway Dont come in Roscoe she murmured I
dont want to see you And as he turned away she added Im kind of
sorry for you Roscoe

Her antagonist Edith was not more coherent in her own wailings
and she had the advantage of a mother for listener She had also the
disadvantage of a mother for duenna and Mrs Sheridan under her
husbands sharp tutelage proved an effective one Edith was reduced to
telephoning Lamhorn from shops whenever she could juggle her mother into
a momentary distraction over a counter

Edith was incomparably more in love than before Lamhorns expulsion Her
whole being was nothing but the determination to hurdle everything that
separated her from him She was in a state that could be altered by only
the lightest and most delicate diplomacy of suggestion but Sheridan
like legions of other parents intensified her passion and fed it hourly
fuel by opposing to it an intolerable force He swore she should cool
and thus set her on fire

Edith planned neatly She fought hard every other evening with her
father and kept her bed betweentimes to let him see what his violence
had done to her Then when the mere sight of her set him to breathing
fast she said pitiably that she might bear her trouble better if she
went away it was impossible to be in the same town with Lamhorn and not
think always of him Perhaps in New York she might forget a little
She had written to a school friend established quietly with an aunt in
apartmentsand a month or so of theaters and restaurants might bring
peace Sheridan shouted with relief he gave her a copious cheque and
she left upon a Monday morning wearing violets with her mourning and
having kissed everybody goodby except Sibyl and Bibbs She might have
kissed Bibbs but he failed to realize that the day of her departure
had arrived and was surprised on returning from his zinceater that
evening to find her gone I suppose theyll be maried there he said
casually

Sheridan seated warming his stockinged feet at the fire jumped up
fuming Either you go out o here or I will Bibbs he snorted I
dont want to be in the same room with the particular kind of idiot you
are Shes through with that riffraff all she needed was to be kept
away from him a few weeks and I KEPT her away and it did the business
For Heavens sake go on out o here

Bibbs obeyed the gesture of a hand still bandaged And the black silk
sling was still round Sheridans neck but no word of Gurneys and no
excruciating twinge of pain could keep Sheridans hand in the sling The
wounds slight enough originally had become infected the first time he
had dislodged the bandages and healing was long delayed Sheridan had
the habit of gesture he could not take time to remember he said
that he must be careful and he had also a curious indignation with his
hurt he refused to pay it the compliment of admitting its existence

The Saturday following Ediths departure Gurney came to the Sheridan
Building to dress the wounds and to have a talk with Sheridan which
the doctor felt had become necessary But he was a little before
the appointed time and was obliged to wait a few minutes in an
anteroomthere was a directors meeting of some sort in Sheridans
office The door was slightly ajar leaking cigarsmoke and oratory the
latter all Sheridans and Gurney listened

No sir no sir no sir he heard the big voice rumbling and then
breaking into thunder I tell you NO Some o you men make me sick
Youd lose your confidence in Almighty God if a doodlebug flipped his
hind leg at you You say moneys tight all over the country Well what
if it is Theres no reason for it to be tight and its not goin to
keep OUR money tight Youre always runnin to the woodshed to hide
your nickels in a crack because some fool newspaper says the markets a
little skeery You listen to every streetcorner croaker and then
come and set here and try to scare ME out of a big thing Were IN on
thisunderstand I tell you there never WAS better times These are
good times and big times and I wont stand for any other kind o talk
This countrys on its feet as it never was before and this citys on
its feet and goin to stay there And Gurney heard a series of whacks
and thumps upon the desk Bad times Sheridan vociferated with
accompanying thumps Rabbit talk These times are glorious I tell you
Were in the promised land and were goin to STAY there Thats all
gentlemen The loan goes

The directors came forth flushed and murmurous and Gurney hastened
in His guess was correct Sheridan had been thumping the desk with his
right hand The physician scolded wearily making good the fresh damage
as best he might and then he said what he had to say on the subject of
Roscoe and Sibyl his opinion meeting as he expected a warmly hostile
reception But the result of this conversation was that by telephonic
command Roscoe awaited his father an hour later in the library at the
New House

Gurney says your wifes able to travel Sheridan said brusquely as he
came in

Yes Roscoe occupied a deep chair and sat in the dejected attitude
which had become his habit Yes she is

Edith had to leave town and so Sibyl thinks shell have to too

Oh I wouldnt put it that way Roscoe protested drearily

No I hear YOU wouldnt There was a bitter gibe in the fathers
voice and he added Its a good thing shes goin abroadif shell
stay there I shouldnt think any of us want her here any moreyou
least of all

Its no use your talking that way said Roscoe You wont do any
good

Well when are you comin back to your office Sheridan used a
brisker kinder tone Three weeks since you showed up there at all
When you goin to be ready to cut out whiskey and all the rest o the
foolishness and start in again You ought to be able to make up for a
lot o lost time and a lot o spilt milk when that woman takes herself
out o the way and lets you and all the rest of us alone

Its no use father I tell you I know what Gurney was going to say to
you Im not going back to the office Im DONE

Wait a minute before you talk that way Sheridan began his sentrygo
up and down the room I suppose you know its taken two pretty good
men about sixteen hours a day to set things straight and get em runnin
right again down in your office

They must be good men Roscoe nodded indifferently I thought I was
doing about eight mens work Im glad you found two that could handle
it

Look here If I worked you it was for your own good There are plenty
men drive hardern I do and

Yes There are some that break down all the other men that work with
em They either die or go crazy or have to quit and are no use
the rest of their lives The lasts my case I guesscomplicated by
domestic difficulties

You set there and tell me you give up Sheridans voice shook and
so did the gesticulating hand which he extended appealingly toward the
despondent figure Dont do it Roscoe Dont say it Say youll come
down there again and be a man This woman aint goin to trouble you any
more The work aint goin to hurt you if you havent got her to worry
you and you can get shut o this nasty whiskeyguzzlin it aint
fastened on you yet Dont say

Its no use on earth Roscoe mumbled No use on earth

Look here If you want another months vacation

I know Gurney told you so whats the use talking about vacations

Gurney Sheridan vociferated the name savagely Its Gurney Gurney
Gurney Always Gurney I dont know what the worlds comin to with
everybody runnin around squealin The doctor says this and The
doctor says that It makes me sick Hows this country expect to get
its Work done if Gurney and all the other old nannygoats keep up this
blattinOh oh Dont lift that stick o wood youll ruin your
NERVES So he says you got nervous exhaustion induced by overwork and
emotional strain They always got to stick the Work in if they see a
chance I reckon you did have the emotional strain and thats alls
the matter with you Youll be over it soons this womans gone and
Works the very thing to make you quit frettin about her

Did Gurney tell you I was fit to work

Shut up Sheridan bellowed Im so sick o that mans name I feel
like shootin anybody that says it to me He fumed and chafed swearing
indistinctly then came and stood before his son Look here do you
think youre doin the square thing by me Do you How much you worth

Ive got between seven and eight thousand a year clear of my own
outside the salary That much is mine whether I work or not

It is You coulda pulled it out without me I suppose you think at
your age

No But its mine and its enough

My Lord Its about what a Congressman gets and you want to quit
there I suppose you think youll get the rest when I kick the bucket
and all you have to do is lay back and wait You let me tell you right
here youll never see one cent of it You go out o business now and
what would you know about handlin it five or ten or twenty years from
now Because I intend to STAY here a little while yet my boy Theyd
either get it away from you or youd sell for a nickel and let it be
split up and He whirled about marched to the other end of the room
and stood silent a moment Then he said solemnly Listen If you go
out now you leave me in the lurch with nothin on Gods green earth
to depend on but your brotherand you know what he is Ive depended on
you for it ALL since Jim died Now youve listened to that dam doctor
and he says maybe you wont ever be as good a man as you were and that
certainly you wont be for a year or soprobably more Now thats all
a lie Men dont break down that way at your age Look at ME And I tell
you you can shake this thing off All you need is a little GETup and
a little gumption Men dont go away for YEARS and then come back into
MOVING businesses like oursthey lose the strings And if you could I
wont let youif you lay down on me now I wontand thats because if
you lay down you prove you aint the man I thought you were He cleared
his throat and finished quietly Roscoe will you take a months
vacation and come back and go to it

No said Roscoe listlessly Im through

All right said Sheridan He picked up the evening paper from a
table went to a chair by the fire and sat down his back to his son
Goodby

Roscoe rose his head hanging but there was a dull relief in his eyes
Best I can do he muttered seeming about to depart yet lingering I
figure it out a good deal like this he said I didnt KNOW my job
was any strain and I managed all right but from what Gurfrom what
I hear I was just up to the limit of my nerves from overwork and
thethe trouble at home was the extra strain thats fixed me the way I
am I tried to brace so I could stand the work and the trouble too on
whiskeyand that put the finish to me IIm not hitting it as hard as
I was for a while and I reckon pretty soon if I can get to feeling a
little more energy I better try to quit entirelyI dont know Im all
inand the doctor says so I thought I was running along fine up to a
few months ago but all the time I was ready to bust and didnt know
it Now then I dont want you to blame Sibyl and if I were you
I wouldnt speak of her as that woman because shes your
daughterinlaw and going to stay that way She didnt do anything
wicked It was a shock to me and I dont deny it to find what she had
doneencouraging that fellow to hang around her after he began trying
to flirt with her and losing her head over him the way she did I dont
deny it was a shock and that itll always be a hurt inside of me Ill
never get over But it was my fault I didnt understand a womans
nature Poor Roscoe spoke in the most profound and desolate earnest
A woman craves society and gaiety and meeting attractive people and
traveling Well I cant give her the other things but I can give her
the travelingreal traveling not just going to Atlantic City or
New Orleans the way she has two three times A woman has to have
something in her life besides a business man And thats ALL I was I
never understood till I heard her talking when she was so sick and I
believe if youd heard her then you wouldnt speak so hardheartedly
about her I believe you might have forgiven her like I have Thats
all I never cared anything for any girl but her in my life but I was
so busy with business I put it ahead of her I never THOUGHT about her
I was so busy thinking business Well this is where its brought us
toand now when you talk about business to me I feel the way you do
when anybody talks about Gurney to you The word business makes me
dizzyit makes me honestly sick at the stomach I believe if I had
to go downtown and step inside that office door Id fall down on the
floor deathly sick You talk about a months vacationand I get just
as sick Im rattledI cant planI havent got any planscant make
any except to take my girl and get just as far away from that office as
I canand stay Were going to Japan first and if we

His father rustled the paper I said goodby Roscoe

Goodby said Roscoe listlessly



CHAPTER XXIV

Sheridan waited until he heard the sound of the outer door closing then
he rose and pushed a tiny disk set in the wall Jackson appeared

Has Bibbs got home from work

Mist Bibbs No suh

Tell him I want to see him soon as he comes

Yessuh

Sheridan returned to his chair and fixed his attention fiercely upon
the newspaper He found it difficult to pursue the items beyond
their explanatory rubricsthere was nothing unusual or startling to
concentrate his attention

 European City Holds Candle Sheridan nodded approvingly here

Bibbs came through the hall whistling and entered the room briskly
Well father did you want me

Yes Sit down Sheridan got up and Bibbs took a seat by the fire
holding out his hands to the crackling blaze for it was cold outdoors

I came within seven of the shop record today he said I handled
more strips than any other workman has any day this month The nearest
to me is sixteen behind

There exclaimed his father greatly pleased Whatd I tell you
Id like to hear Gurney hint again that I wasnt right in sending you
thereI would just like to hear him And youaint you ashamed of
makin such a fuss about it Aint you

I didnt go at it in the right spirit the other time Bibbs said
smiling brightly his face ruddy in the cheerful firelight I didnt
know the difference it meant to like a thing

Well I guess Ive pretty thoroughly vindicated my judgement I guess I
HAVE I said the shopd be good for you and it was I said it wouldnt
hurt you and it hasnt Its been just exactly what I said it would be
Aint that so

Looks like it Bibbs agreed gaily

Well Id like to know any place I been wrong first and last Instead
o hurting you its been the makin of youphysically Youre a good
inch tallern what I am and youd be a bigger man than what I am
if youd get some flesh on your bones and you ARE gettin a little
Physically its started you out to be the huskiest one o the whole
family Now then mentallythats different I dont say it unkindly
Bibbs but you got to do something for yourself mentally just like
whats begun physically And Im goin to help you

Sheridan decided to sit down again He brought his chair close to his
sons and leaning over tapped Bibbss knee confidentially I got
plans for you Bibbs he said

Bibbs instantly looked thoroughly alarmed He drew back IIm all
right now father

Listen Sheridan settled himself in his chair and spoke in the tone
of a reasonable man reasoning Listen here Bibbs I had another blow
today and it was a hard one and right in the face though I HAVE been
expectin it some little time back Well its got to be met Now Ill
be frank with you As I said a minute ago mentally I couldnt ever
called you exactly strong You been a little weak both ways most of
your life Not but what I think you GOT a mentality if youd learn to
use it You got willpower Ill say that for you I never knew boy or
man that could be stubbornernever one in my life Now then youve
showed you could learn to run that machine best of any man in the shop
in no time at all That looks to me like you could learn to do other
things I dont deny but what its an encouragin sign I dont deny
that at all Well that helps me to think the case aint so hopeless as
it looks Youre all I got to meet this blow with but maybe you aint
as poor material as I thought Your tellin me about comin within
seven strips of the shops record today looks to me like encouragin
information brought in at just about the right time Now then Im
goin to give you a raise I wanted to send you straight on up through
the shopsa year or two maybebut I cant do it I lost Jim and now
Ive lost Roscoe Hes quit Hes laid down on me If he ever comes back
at all hell be a long time pickin up the strings and anyway he
aint the man I thought he was I cant count on him I got to have
SOMEBODY I KNOW I can count on And Im down to this youre my last
chance Bibbs I got to learn you to use what brains you got and see if
we cant develop em a little Who knows And Im goin to put my time
in on it Im goin to take you right downtown with ME and I wont be
hard on you if youre a little slow at first And Im goin to do the
big thing for you Im goin to make you feel you got to do the big
thing for me in return Ive vindicated my policy with you about the
shop and now Im goin to turn right around and swing you way over
ahead of where the other boys started and Im goin to make an appeal
to your ambition thatll make you dizzy He tapped his son on the knee
again Bibbs Im goin to start you off this way Im goin to
make you a director in the Pump Works Company Im goin to make you
vicepresident of the Realty Company and a vicepresident of the Trust
Company

Bibbs jumped to his feet blanched Oh no he cried

Sheridan took his dismay to be the excitement of sudden joy Yes
sir And theres some pretty fat little salaries goes with those
vicepresidencies and a pinch o stock in the Pump Company with the
directorship You thought I was pretty mean about the shopoh I know
you didbut you see the old man can play it both ways And so right
now the minute youve begun to make good the way I wanted you to
I deal from the new deck And Ill keep on handin it out bigger and
bigger every time you show me youre big enough to play the hand I deal
you Im startin you with a pretty big one my boy

But I dontI dontI dont want it Bibbs stammered

Whatd you say Sheridan thought he had not heard aright

I dont want it father I thank youI do thank you

Sheridan looked perplexed Whats the matter with you Didnt you
understand what I was tellin you

Yes

You sure I reckon you didnt I offered

I know I know But I cant take it

Whats the matter with you Sheridan was half amazed half suspicious
Your head feel funny

Ive never been quite so sane in my life said Bibbs as I have
lately And Ive got just what I want Im living exactly the right
life Im earning my daily bread and Im happy in doing it My wages
are enough I dont want any more money and I dont deserve any

Damnation Sheridan sprang up Youve turned Socialist You been
listening to those fellows down there and you

No sir I think theres a great deal in what they say but that isnt
it

Sheridan tried to restrain his growing fury and succeeded partially
Then what is it Whats the matter

Nothing his son returned nervously Nothingexcept that Im
content I dont want to change anything

Why not

Bibbs had the incredible folly to try to explain Ill tell you
father if I can I know it may be hard to understand

Yes I think it may be said Sheridan grimly What you say usually
is a LITTLE that way Go on

Perturbed and distressed Bibbs rose instinctively he felt himself at
every possible disadvantage He was a sleeper clinging to a dreama
rough hand stretched to shake him and waken him He went to a table and
made vague drawings upon it with a finger and as he spoke he kept his
eyes lowered You werent altogether right about the shopthat is
in one way you werent father He glanced up apprehensively Sheridan
stood facing him expressionless and made no attempt to interrupt
Thats difficult to explain Bibbs continued lowering his eyes again
to follow the tracings of his finger II believe the shop might have
done for me this time if I hadntif something hadnt helped me tooh
not only to bear it but to be happy in it Well I AM happy in it
I want to go on just as I am And of all things on earth that I dont
want I dont want to live a business lifeI dont want to be drawn
into it I dont think it IS livingand now I AM living I have the
healthful toiland I can think In business as important as yours I
couldnt think anything but business I dontI dont think making
money is worth while

Go on said Sheridan curtly as Bibbs paused timidly

It hasnt seemed to get anywhere that I can see said Bibbs You
think this city is rich and powerfulbut whats the use of its being
rich and powerful They dont teach the children any more in the schools
because the city is rich and powerful They teach them more than they
used to because some peoplenot rich and powerful peoplehave thought
the thoughts to teach the children And yet when youve been reading
the paper Ive heard you objecting to the children being taught anything
except what would help them to make money You said it was wasting the
taxes You want them taught to make a living but not to live When I
was a little boy this wasnt an ugly town now its hideous Whats the
use of being big just to be hideous I mean I dont think all this has
meant really going aheadits just been getting bigger and dirtier and
noisier Wasnt the whole country happier and in many ways wiser when it
was smaller and cleaner and quieter and kinder I know you think Im an
utter fool father but after all though arent business and politics
just the housekeeping part of life And wouldnt you despise a woman
that not only made her housekeeping her ambition but did it so noisily
and dirtily that the whole neighborhood was in a continual turmoil over
it And suppose she talked and thought about her housekeeping all
the time and was always having additions built to her house when she
couldnt keep clean what she already had and suppose with it all she
made the house altogether unpeaceful and unlivable

Just one minute Sheridan interrupted adding with terrible courtesy
If you will permit me Have you ever been right about anything

I dont quite

I ask the simple question Have you ever been right about anything
whatever in the course of your life Have you ever been right upon
any subject or question youve thought about and talked about Can you
mention one single time when you were proved to be right

He was flourishing the bandaged hand as he spoke but Bibbs said only
If Ive always been wrong before surely theres more chance that Im
right about this It seems reasonable to suppose something would be due
to bring up my average

Yes I thought you wouldnt see the point And theres another you
probably couldnt see but Ill take the liberty to mention it You been
balkin all your life Pretty much everything I ever wanted you to do
youd let out SOME kind of a holler like you are nowand yet I cant
seem to remember once when you didnt have to lay down and do what I
said But go on with your remarks about our city and the business of
this country Go on

I dont want to be a part of it said Bibbs with unwonted decision
I want to keep to myself and Im doing it now I couldnt if I went
down there with you Id be swallowed into it I dont care for money
enough to

No his father interrupted still dangerously quiet Youve never had
to earn a living Anybody could tell that by what you say Now let me
remind you youre sleepin in a pretty good bed youre eatin pretty
fair food youre wearin pretty fine clothes Just suppose one o these
noisy housekeepersme for instancedecided to let you do your own
housekeepin May I ask what your proposition would be

Im earning nine dollars a week said Bibbs sturdily Its enough I
shouldnt mind at all

Whos payin you that nine dollars a week

My work Bibbs answered And Ive done so well on that
clippingmachine I believe I could work up to fifteen or even twenty
a week at another job I could be a fair plumber in a few months
Im sure Id rather have a trade than be in businessI should
infinitely

You better set about learnin one pretty dam quick But Sheridan
struggled with his temper and again was partially successful in
controlling it You better learn a trade over Sunday because youre
either goin down with me to my office Monday morningoryou can go to
plumbing

All right said Bibbs gently I can get along

Sheridan raised his hands sardonically as in prayer O God he said
this boy was crazy enough before he began to earn his nine dollars a
week and now his moneys gone to his head Cant You do nothin for
him Then he flung his hands apart palms outward in a furious gesture
of dismissal Get out o this room You got a skull thats thickern a
whales thighbone but its cracked spang all the way across You hated
the machineshop so bad when I sent you there you went and stayed sick
for over two yearsand now when I offer to take you out of it and give
you the mint you holler for the shop like a calf for its mammy Youre
cracked Oh but I got a fine layout here One son died one quit and
ones a loon The loons all I got left H P Ellerslys wife had
a crazy brother and they undertook to keep him at the house First
morning he was there he walked straight though a tendollar plateglass
window out into the yard He says Oh look at the pretty dandelion
Thats what youre doin You want to spend your life sayin Oh look
at the pretty dandelion and you dont care a tinkers dam what you
bust Well mister loon or no loon cracked and crazy or whatever you
are Ill take you with me Monday morning and Ill work you and learn
youyes and Ill lam you if I got tountil Ive made something out
of you thats fit to be called a business man Ill keep at you while
Im able to stand and if I have to lay down to die Ill be whisperin
at you till they get the embalminfluid into me Now go on and dont
let me hear from you again till you can come and tell me youve waked
up you poor pitiful dandelionpickin SLEEPWALKER

Bibbs gave him a queer look There was something like reproach in it
for once but there was more than thathe seemed to be startled by his
fathers last word



CHAPTER XXV

There was sleet that evening with a whopping wind but neither this
storm nor that other which so imminently threatened him held place
in the consciousness of Bibbs Sheridan when he came once more to the
presence of Mary All was right in his world as he sat with her reading
Maurice Maeterlincks Alladine and Palomides The sorrowful light of
the gasjet might have been May morning sunshine flashing amber and rose
through the glowing windows of the SainteChapelle it was so bright for
Bibbs And while the zinceater held out to bring him such golden nights
as these all the kings horses and all the kings men might not serve
to break the spell

Bibbs read slowly but in a reasonable manner as if he were talking
and Mary looking at him steadily from beneath her curved fingers
appeared to discover no fault It had grown to be her habit to look at
him whenever there was an opportunity It may be said in truth that
while they were together and it was light she looked at him all the
time

When he came to the end of Alladine and Palomides they were silent a
little while considering together then he turned back the pages and
said Theres something I want to read over This

 You would think I threw a window open on the dawn She has a
 soul that can be seen around herthat takes you in its arms like
 an ailing child and without saying anything to you consoles you
 for everything I shall never understand it all I do not know
 how it can all be but my knees bend in spite of me when I speak
 of it

He stopped and looked at her

You boy said Mary not very clearly

Oh yes he returned But its trueespecially my knees

You boy she murmured again blushing charmingly You might read
another line over The first time I ever saw you Bibbs you were
looking into a mirror Do it again But you neednt read itI can give
it to you A little Greek slave that came from the heart of Arcady

I Im one of the hands at the Pump Worksand going to stay one
unless I have to decide to study plumbing

No She shook her head You love and want whats beautiful and
delicate and serene its really art that you want in your life and
have always wanted You seemed to me from the first the most wistful
person I had ever known and thats what you were wistful for

Bibbs looked doubtful and more wistful than ever but after a moment or
two the matter seemed to clarify itself to him Why no he said I
wanted something else more than that I wanted you

And here I am she laughed completely understanding I think were
like those two in The Cloister and the Hearth Im just the rough
Burgundian crossbow man Denys who followed that gentle Gerard and
told everybody that the devil was dead

He isnt though said Bibbs as a hoarse little bell in the next room
began a series of snappings which proved to be ten upon count He gets
into the clock whenever Im with you And sighing deeply he rose to
go

Youre always very prompt about leaving me

II try to be he said It isnt easy to be careful not to risk
everything by giving myself a little more at a time If I ever saw you
look tired

Have you ever

Not yet You always lookyou always look

How

Carefree Thats it Except when you feel sorry for me about
something you always have that splendid look It puts courage into
people to see it If I had a struggle to face Id keep remembering that
lookand Id never give up Its a brave look too as though gaiety
might be a kind of gallantry on your part and yet I dont quite
understand why it should be either He smiled quizzically looking
down upon her Mary you havent a secret sorrow have you

For answer she only laughed

No he said I cant imagine you with a care in the world I think
thats why you were so kind to meyou have nothing but happiness in
your own life and so you could spare time to make my troubles turn to
happiness too But theres one little time in the twentyfour hours
when Im not happy Its now when I have to say good night I feel
dismal every time it comesand then when Ive left the house theres
a bad little blankness a black void as though I were temporarily
dead and it lasts until I get it established in my mind that Im really
beginning another day thats to end with YOU again Then I cheer up But
nows the bad timeand I must go through it and sogood night And
he added with a pungent vehemence of which he was little aware I hate
it

Do you she said rising to go to the door with him But he stood
motionless gazing at her wonderingly

Mary Your eyes are so He stopped

Yes But she looked quickly away

I dont know he said I thought just then

What did you think

I dont knowit seemed to me that there was something I ought to
understandand didnt

She laughed and met his wondering gaze again frankly My eyes are
pleased she said Im glad that you miss me a little after you go

But tomorrows coming faster than other days if youll let it he
said

She inclined her head Yes Illlet it

Going to church said Bibbs It IS going to church when I go with
you

She went to the front door with him she always went that far They had
formed a little code of leavetaking by habit neither of them ever
speaking of it but it was always the same She always stood in the
doorway until he reached the sidewalk and there he always turned and
looked back and she waved her hand to him Then he went on halfway to
the New House and looked back again and Mary was not in the doorway
but the door was open and the light shone It was as if she meant to
tell him that she would never shut him out he could always see that
friendly light of the open doorwayas if it were open for him to come
back if he would He could see it until a wing of the New House came
between when he went up the path The open doorway seemed to him the
beautiful symbol of her friendshipof her thought of him a symbol of
herself and of her ineffable kindness

And she kept the door openeven tonight though the sleet and fine
snow swept in upon her bare throat and arms and her brown hair was
strewn with tiny white stars His heart leaped as he turned and saw that
she was there waving her hand to him as if she did not know that the
storm touched her When he had gone on Mary did as she always didshe
went into an unlit room across the hall from that in which they had
spent the evening and looking from the window watched him until he
was out of sight The storm made that difficult tonight but she
caught a glimpse of him under the streetlamp that stood between the two
houses and saw that he turned to look back again Then and not before
she looked at the upper windows of Roscoes house across the street
They were dark Mary waited but after a little while she closed the
front door and returned to her window A moment later two of the upper
windows of Roscoes house flashed into light and a hand lowered the
shade of one of them Mary felt the cold thenit was the third night
she had seen those windows lighted and the shade lowered just after
Bibbs had gone

But Bibbs had no glance to spare for Roscoes windows He stopped for
his last look back at the open door and with a thin mantle of white
already upon his shoulders made his way gasping in the wind to the
lee of the sheltering wing of the New House

A stricken George muttering hoarsely admitted him and Bibbs became
aware of a paroxysm within the house Terrible sounds came from the
library Sheridan cursing as never before his wife sobbing her voice
rising to an agonized squeal of protest upon each of a series of muffled
detonationsthe outrageous thumping of a bandaged hand upon wood then
Gurney sharply imperious Keep your hand in that sling Keep your hand
in that sling I say

LOOK George gasped delighted to play herald for so important a
tragedy and he renewed upon his face the ghastly expression with which
he had first beheld the ruins his calamitous gesture laid before the
eyes of Bibbs Look at at lamidal statue

Gazing down the hall Bibbs saw heroic wreckage seemingly
Byzantinepainted colossal fragments of the shattered torso
appallingly human and gilded and silvered heaps of magnificence strewn
among ruinous palms like the spoil of a barbarians battle There had
been a massacre in the oasisthe Moor had been hurled headlong from his
pedestal

He hit at ole lamidal statue said George POW

My father

YESsuh POW he hit er An you ma run tell me git doctuh quick s
I kin telefoamshe sho you pa goin bus a bloodvessel He aint
takin on tall NOW He aint nothin tall to what he was while ago

crumpled telegraph form Here what come he said I pick er up when

Bibbs read the telegram quickly It was from New York and addressed to
Mrs Sheridan

 health would probably suffered severely Robert and I were married
 this afternoon thought best have quiet wedding absolutely sure
 you will understand wisdom of step when you know Robert better am
 happiest woman in world are leaving for Florida will wire address

 Edith Lamhorn



CHAPTER XXVI

George departed and Bibbs was left gazing upon chaos and listening to
thunder He could not reach the stairway without passing the open doors
of the library and he was convinced that the mere glimpse of him just
then would prove nothing less than insufferable for his father For
that reason he was about to make his escape into the goldandbrocade
room intending to keep out of sight when he heard Sheridan
vociferously demanding his presence

Tell him to come in here Hes out there I heard George just let him
in Now youll SEE And tearstained Mrs Sheridan looking out into
the hall beckoned to her son

Bibbs went as far as the doorway Gurney sat winding a strip of white
cotton his black bag open upon a chair near by and Sheridan was
striding up and down his hand so heavily wrapped in fresh bandages that
he seemed to be wearing a small boxingglove His eyes were bloodshot
his forehead was heavily bedewed one side of his collar had broken
loose and there were bloodstains upon his right cuff

THERES our little sunshine he cried as Bibbs appeared THERES the
hope o the familymy lifelong pride and joy I want

Keep you hand in that sling said Gurney sharply

Sheridan turned upon him uttering a sound like a howl For Gods sake
sing another tune he cried You said you came as a doctor but stay
as a friend and in that capacity you undertake to sit up and criticize
ME

Oh talk sense said the doctor and yawned intentionally What do
you want Bibbs to say

You were sittin up there tellin me I got hystericalhysterical
oh Lord You sat up there and told me I got hysterical over nothin
You sat up there tellin me I didnt have as heavy burdens as many
another man you knew I just want you to hear THIS Now listen He
swung toward the quiet figure waiting in the doorway Bibbs will you
come downtown with me Monday morning and let me start you with two
vicepresidencies a directorship stock and salaries I ask you

No father said Bibbs gently

Sheridan looked at Gurney and then faced his son once more

Bibbs you want to stay in the shop do you at nine dollars a week
instead of takin up my offer

Yes sir

And Id like the doctor to hear Whatll you do if I decide youre
too highpriced a workinman either to live in my house or work in my
shop

Find other work said Bibbs

There You hear him for yourself Sheridan cried You hear what

Keep you hand in that sling Yes I hear him

Sheridan leaned over Gurney and shouted in a voice that cracked and
broke piping into falsetto He thinks of bein a PLUMBER He wants to
be a PLUMBER He told me he couldnt THINK if he went into businesshe
wants to be a plumber so he can THINK

He fell back a step wiping his forhead with the back of his left hand
There Thats my son Thats the only son I got now Thats my chance
to live he cried with a bitterness that seemed to leave ashes in his
throat Thats my one chance to livethat thing you see in the doorway
yonder

Dr Gurney thoughtfully regarded the bandage strip he had been winding
and tossed it into the open bag Whats the matter with giving Bibbs a
chance to live he said coolly I would if I were you Youve had TWO
that went into business

Sheridans mouth moved grotesquely before he could speak Joe Gurney
he said when he could command himself so far are you accusin me of
the responsibility for the death of my son James

I accuse you of nothing said the doctor But just once Id like
to have it out with you on the question of Bibbsand while hes here
too He got up walked to the fire and stood warming his hands behind
his back and smiling Look here old fellow lets be reasonable he
said You were bound Bibbs should go to the shop again and I gave you
and him both to understand pretty plainly that if he went it was at
the risk of his life Well what did he do He said he wanted to go And
he did go and hes made good there Now see Isnt that enough Cant
you let him off now He wants to write and how do you know that he
couldnt do it if you gave him a chance How do you know he hasnt some
messagesomething to say that might make the world just a little
bit happier or wiser He MIGHTin timeits a possibility not to be
denied Now he cant deliver any message if he goes down there with you
and he wont HAVE any to deliver I dont say going down with you is
likely to injure his health as I thought the shop would and as the
shop did the first time Im not speaking as doctor now anyhow But
I tell you one thing I know if you take him down there youll kill
something that I feel is in him and its finer I think than his
physical body and youll kill it deader than a doornail And so
why not let it live Youve about come to the end of your string old
fellow Why not stop this perpetual devilish fighting and give Bibbs his
chance

Sheridan stood looking at him fixedly What fighting

Yourswith nature Gurney sustained the daunting gaze of his fierce
antagonist equably You dont seem to understand that youve been
struggling against actual law

What law

Natural law said Gurney What do you think beat you with Edith Did
Edith herself beat you Didnt she obey without question something
powerful that was against you EDITH wasnt against you and you werent
against HER but you set yourself against the power that had her in its
grip and it shot out a spurt of flameand won in a walk Whats taken
Roscoe from you Timbers bear just so much strain old man but YOU
wanted to send the load across the broken bridge and you thought you
could bully or coax the cracked thing into standing Well you couldnt
Now heres Bibbs There are thousands of men fit for the life you want
him to leadand so is he It wouldnt take half of Bibbss brains to be
twice as good a business man as Jim and Roscoe put together

WHAT Sheridan goggled at him like a zany

Your son Bibbs said the doctor composedly Bibbs Sheridan has
the kind and quantity of gray matter that will make him a success in
anythingif he ever wakes up Personally I should prefer him to remain
asleep I like him that way But the thousands of men fit for the life
you want him to lead arent fit to do much with the life he OUGHT
to lead Blindly hes been fighting for the chance to lead ithes
obeying something that begs to stay alive within him and blindly he
knows youll crush it out Youve set your will to do it Let me tell
you something more You dont know what youve become since Jims going
thwarted youand thats what was uppermost a bafflement stronger than
your normal grief Youre half mad with a consuming fury against the
very self of the lawfor it was the very self of the law that took Jim
from you That was a law concerning the cohesion of molecules The very
self of the law took Roscoe from you and gave Edith the certainty of
beating you and the very self of the law makes Bibbs deny you tonight
The LAW beats you Havent you been whipped enough But you want to whip
the lawyouve set yourself against it to bend it to your own ends to
wield it and twist it

The voice broke from Sheridans heaving chest in a shout Yes And by
God I will

So Ajax defied the lightning said Gurney

Ive heard that damfool story too Sheridan retorted fiercely
Thats for chuldern and niggers It aint twentieth century let me
tell you Defied the lightning did he the jackass If hed been half
a man hed a got away with it WE dont go showin off defyin the
lightningwe hitch it up and make it work for us like a blacksteer A
man nowadays would just as soon think o defyin a woodshed

Well what about Bibbs said Gurney Will you be a really big man now
and

Gurney you know a lot about bigness Sheridan began to walk to and
fro again and the doctor returned gloomily to his chair He had shot
his bolt the moment he judged its chance to strike center was best but
the target seemed unaware of the marksman

Im tryin to make a big man out o that poor truck yonder Sheridan
went on and you step in beggin me to let him be Lord knows whatI
dont I suppose you figure it out that now I got a SONINLAW I
mightnt need a son Yes I got a soninlaw nowa spender

Oh put your hand back said Gurney wearily

There was a bronze inkstand upon the table Sheridan put his right hand
in the sling but with his left he swept the inkstand from the table
and halfway across the rooma comet with a destroying black tail Mrs
Sheridan shrieked and sprang toward it

Let it lay he shouted fiercely Let it lay And weeping she
obeyed Yes sir he went on in a voice the more ominous for the
sudden hush he put upon it I got a spender for a soninlaw Its
wonderful where property goes sometimes There was ole man Tracyyou
remember him DocJ R Tracy solid banker He went into the bank as
messenger seventeen years old he was president at fortythree and he
built that bank with his life for forty years more He was down there
from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon the day before he
diedover eighty Gilt edge that bank It was diamond edge He used
to eat a bag o peanuts and an apple for lunch but he wasnt
stingyhe was just livin in his business He didnt care for pie or
automobileshe had his bank It was an institution and it come pretty
near bein the beatin heart o this town in its time Well that ole
man used to pass one o these here turnedupnose and turneduppants
cigarette boys on the streets Never spoke to him Tracy didnt Speak
to him God he wouldnt a coughed on him He wouldnt a let him
clean the cuspidors at the bank Why if hed a just seen him standin
in FRONT the bank hed a had him run off the street And yet all Tracy
was doin every day of his life was workin for that cigarette boy
Tracy thought it was for the bank he thought he was givin his life and
his lifeblood and the blood of his brain for the bank but he wasnt
It was every bitfrom the time he went in at seventeen till he died in
harness at eightythreeit was every last lick of it just slavin for
that turnedupnose turneduppants cigarette boy AND TRACY DIDNT
EVEN KNOW HIS NAME He died not ever havin heard it though he chased
him off the front steps of his house once The day after Tracy died his
oldmaid daughter married the cigaretteand there AINT any Tracy bank
any more And nowhis voice rose againand now I got a cigarette
soninlaw

Gurney pointed to the flourishing right hand without speaking and
Sheridan once more returned it to the sling

My soninlaw likes Florida this winter Sheridan went on Thats
good and my soninlaw better enjoy it because I dont think hell be
there next winter They got twelvethousand dollars to spend and I hear
it can be done in Florida by rich sonsinlaw When Roscoes woman got
me to spend that much on a porch for their new house Edith wouldnt
give me a minutes rest till I turned over the same to her And shes
got it besides what I gave her to go East on Itll be gone long before
this time next year and when she comes home and leaves the cigarette
behindfor goodshell get some more MY name aint Tracy and there
aint goin to be any Tracy business in the Sheridan family And there
aint goin to be any college foundin and endowin and trusteein
nor Godknowswhat to keep my property alive when Im gone Edithll
be back and shell get a girls share when shes through with that
cigarette but

By the way interposed Gurney didnt Mrs Sheridan tell me that
Bibbs warned you Edith would marry Lamhorn in New York

Sheridan went completely to pieces he swore while his wife screamed
and stopped her ears And as he swore he pounded the table with his
wounded hand and when the doctor after storming at him ineffectively
sprang to catch and protect that hand Sheridan wrenched it away
tearing the bandage He hammered the table till it leaped

Fool he panted choking If hes shown gumption enough to guess
right the first time in his life its enough for me to begin learnin
him on And struggling with the doctor he leaned toward Bibbs
thrusting forward his convulsed face which was deathly pale My name
aint Tracy I tell you he screamed hoarsely You give in you
stubborn fool Ive had my way with you before and Ill have my way
with you now

Bibbss face was as white as his fathers but he kept remembering that
splendid look of Marys which he had told her would give him courage
in a struggle so that he would never give up

No You cant have your way he said And then obeying a significant
motion of Gurneys head he went out quickly leaving them struggling



CHAPTER XXVII

Mrs Sheridan in a wrapper noiselessly opened the door of her
husbands room at daybreak the next morning and peered within the
darkened chamber At the old house they had shared a room but the
architect had chosen to separate them at the New and they had not known
how to formulate an objection although to both of them something seemed
vaguely reprehensible in the new arrangement

Sheridan did not stir and she was withdrawing her head from the
aperture when he spoke

Oh Im AWAKE Come in if you want to and shut the door

She came and sat by the bed I woke up thinkin about it she
explained And the more I thought about it the surer I got I must
be right and I knew youd be tormentin yourself if you was awake
sowell you got plenty other troubles but Im just sure you aint
goin to have the worry with Bibbs it looks like

You BET I aint he grunted

Look how biddable he was about goin back to the Works she continued
Hes a right goodhearted boy really and sometimes I honestly have to
say he seems right smart too Now and then hell say something sounds
right bright Course most always it doesnt and a good deal of the
time when he says things why I have to feel glad we havent got
company because theyd think he didnt have any gumption at all Yet
look at the way he did when Jimwhen Jim got hurt He took right hold
o things Course hed been sick himself so much and alland the rest
of us never had much and we were kind o green about what to do in
that kind o troublestill he did take hold and everything went off
all right youll have to say that much papa And Dr Gurney says hes
got brains and you cant deny but what the doctors right considerable
of a man He acts sleepy but thats only because hes got such a large
practicehes a pretty wideawake kind of a man some ways Well what
he says last night about Bibbs himself bein asleep and how much hed
amount to if he ever woke upthats what I got to thinkin about You
heard him papa he says Bibbsll be a bigger business man than what
Jim and Roscoe was put togetherif he ever wakes up he says Wasnt
that exactly what he says

I suppose so said Sheridan without exhibiting any interest
Gurneys craziern Bibbs but if he wasntif what he says was
truewhat of it

Listen papa Just suppose Bibbs took it into his mind to get married
You know where he goes all the time

Oh Lord yes Sheridan turned over in the bed his face to the wall
leaving visible of himself only the thick grizzle of his hair You
better go back to sleep He runs over thereevery minute shell let
him I suppose Go back to bed Theres nothin in it

WHY aint there she urged I know betterthere is too You wait
and see Theres just one thing in the world thatll wake the sleepiest
young man alive upyes and make him JUMP upand I dont care who he
is or how sound asleep it looks like he is Thats when he takes it
into his head to pick out some girl and settle down and have a home and
chuldern of his own THEN I guess hell go out after the money Youll
see Ive known dozens o cases and sove youmoony nocount young
men all notions and talk goin to be ministers maybe or something
and theres just this one thing takes it out of em and brings em right
down to business Well I never could make out just what it is
Bibbs wants to be really doesnt seem he wants to be a minister
exactlyhes so faraway you cant tell and he never SAYSbut I know
this is goin to get him right down to common sense Now I dont say
that Bibbs has got the idea in his head yetr else he wouldnt be
talkin that fooltalk about nine dollars a week bein good enough for
him to live on But its COMIN papa and hell JUMP for whatever you
want to hand him out He will And I can tell you this much too hell
want all the salary and stock he can get hold of and hell hustle to
keep gettin more That girls the kind that a young husband just goes
crazy to give things to Shes pretty and finelookin and things look
nice on her and I guess shed like to have em about as well as the
next And I guess she isnt gettin many these days either and shell
be pretty ready for the change I saw her with her sleeves rolled up at
the kitchen window the other day and Jackson told me yesterday their
cook left two weeks ago and they havent tried to hire another one He
says her and her mother been doin the housework a good while and now
theyre doin the cookin too Course Bibbs wouldnt know that
unless shes told him and I reckon she wouldnt shes kind o
stiffishlookin and Bibbs is too up in the clouds to notice anything
like that for himself Theyve never asked him to a meal in the house
but he wouldnt notice that eitherhes kind of innocent Now I was
thinkinyou know I dont suppose weve hardly mentioned the girls
name at table since Jim went but it seems to me maybe if

Sheridan flung out his arms uttering a sound halfgroan halfyawn
Youre barkin up the wrong tree Go on back to bed mamma

Why am I she demanded crossly Why am I barkin up the wrong tree

Because you are Theres nothin in it

Ill bet you she said risingIll bet you he goes to church with
her this morning What you want to bet

Go back to bed he commanded I KNOW what Im talkin about theres
nothin in it I tell you

She shook her head perplexedly You think becausebecause Jim was
runnin so much with her it wouldnt look right

No Nothin to do with it

Thendo you know something about it that you aint told me

Yes I do he grunted Now go on Maybe I can get a little sleep I
aint had any yet

Well She went to the door her expression downcast I thought
maybebut She coughed prefatorily Oh papa something else I
wanted to tell you I was talkin to Roscoe over the phone last night
when the telegram came so I forgot to tell you butwell Sibyl wants
to come over this afternoon Roscoe says she has something she wants to
say to us Itll be the first time shes been out since she was able to
sit upand I reckon she wants to tell us shes sorry for what happened
They expect to get off by the end o the week and I reckon she wants to
feel shes done what she could to kind o make up Anyway thats
what he said I phoned him again about Edith and he said it wouldnt
disturb Sibyl because shed been expectin it she was sure all
along it was goin to happen and besides I guess shes got all that
foolishness pretty much out of her bein so sick But what I thought
was no use bein rough with her papaI expect shes suffered a
good dealand I dont think wed ought to be on Roscoes account
Youllyoull be kind o polite to her wont you papa

He mumbled something which was smothered under the coverlet he had
pulled over his head

What she said timidly I was just sayin I hoped youd treat Sibyl
all right when she comes this afternoon You will wont you papa

He threw the coverlet off furiously I presume so he roared

She departed guiltily

But if he had accepted her proffered wager that Bibbs would go to
church with Mary Vertrees that morning Mrs Sheridan would have lost
Nevertheless Bibbs and Mary did certainly set out from Mr Vertreess
house with the purpose of going to church That was their intention and
they had no other They meant to go to church

But it happened that they were attentively preoccupied in a conversation
as they came to the church and though Mary was looking to the right and
Bibbs was looking to the left Bibbss leftward glance converged with
Marys rightward glance and neither was looking far beyond the other
at this time It also happened that though they were a little jostled
among groups of people in the vicinity of the church they passed this
somewhat prominent edifice without being aware of their proximity to it
and they had gone an incredible number of blocks beyond it before
they discovered their error However feeling that they might be
embarrassingly late if they returned they decided that a walk would
make them as good It was a windless winter morning with an inch of
crisp snow over the ground So they walked and for the most part they
were silent but on their way home after they had turned back at noon
they began to be talkative again

Mary said Bibbs after a time am I a sleepwalker

She laughed a little then looked grave Does your father say you are

Yeswhen hes in a mood to flatter me Other times other names He
has quite a list

You mustnt mind she said gently Hes been getting some pretty
severe shocks What youve told me makes me pretty sorry for him Bibbs
Ive always been sure hes very big

Yes Big andblind Hes like a Hercules without eyes and without any
consciousness except that of his strength and of his purpose to grow
stronger Stronger for what For nothing

Are you sure Bibbs It CANT be for nothing it must be stronger for
something even though he doesnt know what it is Perhaps what he and
his kind are struggling for is something so great they COULDNT see
itso great none of us could see it

No hes just like some blind unconscious thing heaving underground

Till he breaks through and leaps out into the daylight she finished
for him cheerily

Into the smoke said Bibbs Look at the powder of coaldust already
dirtying the decent snow even though its Sunday Thats from the
little pigs the big ones arent so bad on Sunday Theres a fleck of
soot on your cheek Some pig sent it out into the air he might as well
have thrown it on you It would have been braver for then hed have
taken his chance of my whipping him for it if I could

IS there soot on my cheek Bibbs or were you only saying so
rhetorically IS there

Is there There ARE soot on your cheeks Marya fleck on each One
landed since I mentioned the first

She halted immediately giving him her handkerchief and he succeeded in
transferring most of the black from her face to the cambric They were
entirely matterofcourse about it

An elderly couple it chanced had been walking behind Bibbs and Mary
for the last block or so and passed ahead during the removal of the
soot There said the elderly wife Youre always wrong when
you begin guessing about strangers Those two young people arent
honeymooners at alltheyve been married for years A blind man could
see that


I wish I did know who threw that soot on you said Bibbs looking up
at the neighboring chimneys as they went on They arrest children for
throwing snowballs at the streetcars but

But they dont arrest the streetcars for shaking all the pictures in
the houses crooked every time they go by Nor for the uproar they make
I wonder whats the cost in nerves for the noise of the city each year
Yes we pay the price for living in a growing town whether we have
money to pay or none

Who is it gets the pay said Bibbs

Not I she laughed

Nobody gets it There isnt any pay theres only money And only some
of the men downtown get much of that Thats what my father wants me to
get

Yes she said smiling to him and nodding And you dont want it
and you dont need it

But you dont think Im a sleepwalker Mary He had told her of his
fathers new plans for him though he had not described the vigor and
picturesqueness of their setting forth You think Im right

A thousand times she cried There arent so many happy people in
this world I thinkand you say youve found what makes you happy If
its a dreamkeep it

The thought of going down thereinto the money shuffleI hate it as
I never hated the shop he said I hate it And the city itself the
city that the money shuffle has madejust look at it Look at it in
winter The snows tried hard to make the ugliness bearable but the
ugliness is winning its making the snow hideous the snows getting
dirty on top and its foul underneath with the dirt and disease of the
unclean street And the dirt and the ugliness and the rush and the noise
arent the worst of it its what the dirt and ugliness and rush and
noise MEANthats the worst The outward things are insufferable but
theyre only the expression of a spirita blind embryo of a spirit not
yet a souloh just greed And this go ahead nonsense Oughtnt it
all to be a fellowship I shouldnt want to get ahead if I couldId
want to help the other fellow to keep up with me

I read something the other day and remembered it for you said Mary
It was something BurneJones said of a picture he was going to paint
In the first picture I shall make a man walking in the street of
a great city full of all kinds of happy life children and lovers
walking and ladies leaning from the windows all down great lengths of
a street leading to the city walls and there the gates are wide open
letting in a space of green field and cornfield in harvest and all
round his head a great rain of swirling autumn leaves blowing from a
little walled graveyard

And if I painted Bibbs returned Id paint a lady walking in the
street of a great city full of all kinds of uproarious and futile
lifechildren being taught only how to make money and lovers hurrying
to get richer and ladies whod given up trying to wash their windows
clean and the gates of the city wide open letting in slums and
slaughterhouses and freightyards and all round this ladys head a
great rain of swirling soot He paused adding thoughtfully And yet
I believe Im glad that soot got on your cheek It was just as if I were
your brotherthe way you gave me your handkerchief to rub it off for
you Still Edith never

Didnt she said Mary as he paused again

No And I He contented himself with shaking his head instead of
offering more definite information Then he realized that they were
passing the New House and he sighed profoundly Mary our walks
almost over

She looked as blank So it is Bibbs

They said no more until they came to her gate As they drifted slowly
to a stop the door of Roscoes house opened and Roscoe came out with
Sibyl who was startlingly pale She seemed little enfeebled by her
illness however walking rather quickly at her husbands side and not
taking his arm The two crossed the street without appearing to see Mary
and her companion and entering the New House were lost to sight Mary
gazed after them gravely but Bibbs looking at Mary did not see them

Mary he said you seem very serious Is anything bothering you

No Bibbs And she gave him a bright quick look that made him
instantly unreasonably happy

I know you want to go in he began

No I dont want to

I mustnt keep you standing here and I mustnt go in with youbutI
just wanted to sayIve seemed very stupid to myself this morning
grumbling about soot and all thatwhile all the time IMary I think
its been the very happiest of all the hours youve given me I do
AndI dont know just whybut its seemed to me that it was one Id
always remember And you he added falteringly you look soso
beautiful today

It must have been the soot on my cheek Bibbs

Mary will you tell me something he asked

I think I will

Its something Ive had a lot of theories about but none of them
ever just fits You used to wear furs in the fall but now its so much
colder you dontyou never wear them at all any more Why dont you

Her eyes fell for a moment and she grew red Then she looked up gaily
Bibbs if I tell you the answer will you promise not to ask any more
questions

Yes Why did you stop wearing them

Because I found Id be warmer without them She caught his hand
quickly in her own for an instant laughed into his eyes and ran into
the house



CHAPTER XXVIII

It is the consoling attribute of unused books that their decorative
warmth will so often make even a readymade library the actual
livingroom of a family to whom the shelved volumes are indeed sealed
Thus it was with Sheridan who read nothing except newspapers
business letters and figures who looked upon books as he looked upon
bricabrac or crochetingwhen he was at home and not abed or eating
he was in the library

He stood in the manycolored light of the stainedglass window at the
far end of the long room when Roscoe and his wife came in and he
exhaled a solemnity His deference to the Sabbath was manifest
as always in the length of his coat and the closeness of his
Saturdaynight shave and his expression to match this religious pomp
was more than Sabbatical but the most dismaying of his demonstrations
was his keeping his hand in his sling

Sibyl advanced to the middle of the room and halted there not looking
at him but down at her muff in which it could be seen her hands were
nervously moving Roscoe went to a chair in another part of the room
There was a deadly silence

But Sibyl found a shaky voice after an interval of gulping though she
was unable to lift her eyes and the darkling lids continued to veil
them She spoke hurriedly like an ungifted child reciting something
committed to memory but her sincerity was none the less evident for
that

Father Sheridan you and mother Sheridan have always been so kind to
me and I would hate to have you think I dont appreciate it from the
way I acted Ive come to tell you I am sorry for the way I did that
night and to say I know as well as anybody the way I behaved and it
will never happen again because its been a pretty hard lesson
and when we come back some day I hope youll see that youve got a
daughterinlaw you never need to be ashamed of again I want to ask
you to excuse me for the way I did and I can say I havent any feelings
toward Edith now but only wish her happiness and good in her new life
I thank you for all your kindness to me and I know I made a poor return
for it but if you can overlook the way I behaved I know I would feel a
good deal happierand I know Roscoe would too I wish to promise not
to be as foolish in the future and the same error would never occur
again to make us all so unhappy if you can be charitable enought to
excuse it this time

He looked steadily at her without replying and she stood before him
never lifting her eyes motionless save where the moving fur proved the
agitation of her hands within the muff

All right he said at last

She looked up then with vast relief though there was a revelation of
heavy tears when the eyelids lifted

Thank you she said Theres something elseabout something
differentI want to say to you but I want mother Sheridan to hear it
too

Shes upstairs in her room said Sheridan Roscoe

Sibyl interrupted She had just seen Bibbs pass through the hall and
begin to ascend the stairs and in a flash she instinctively perceived
the chance for precisely the effect she wanted

No let me go she said I want to speak to her a minute first
anyway

And she went away quickly gaining the top of the stairs in time to see
Bibbs enter his room and close the door Sibyl knew that Bibbs in his
room had overheard her quarrel with Edith in the hall outside for
bitter Edith thinking the more to shame her had subsequently informed
her of the circumstance Sibyl had just remembered this and with
the recollection there had flashed the thoughtout of her own
experiencethat people are often much more deeply impressed by words
they overhear than by words directly addressed to them Sibyl
intended to make it impossible for Bibbs not to overhear She did not
hesitateher heart was hot with the old sore and she believed wholly
in the justice of her cause and in the truth of what she was going to
say Fate was virtuous at times it had delivered into her hands the
girl who had affronted her

Mrs Sheridan was in her own room The approach of Sibyl and Roscoe had
driven her from the library for she had miscalculated her husbands
mood and she felt that if he used his injured hand as a mark of
emphasis again in her presence she would as she thought of it have
a fit right there She heard Sibyls step and pretended to be putting
a touch to her hair before a mirror

I was just coming down she said as the door opened

Yes he wants you to said Sibyl Its all right mother Sheridan
Hes forgiven me

Mrs Sheridan sniffed instantly tears appeared She kissed her
daughterinlaws cheek then in silence regarded the mirror afresh
wiped her eyes and applied powder

And I hope Edith will be happy Sibyl added inciting more
applications of Mrs Sheridans handkerchief and powder

Yes yes murmured the good woman We mustnt make the worst of
things

Well there was something else I had to say and he wants you to hear
it too said Sibyl We better go down mother Sheridan

She led the way Mrs Sheridan following obediently but when they came
to a spot close by Bibbss door Sibyl stopped I want to tell you
about it first she said abruptly It isnt a secret of course in
any way its something the whole family has to know and the sooner the
whole family knows it the better Its something it wouldnt be RIGHT
for us ALL not to understand and of course father Sheridan most of all
But I want to just kind of go over it first with you itll kind of help
me to see I got it all straight I havent got any reason for saying it
except the good of the family and its nothing to me one way or the
other of course except for that I oughtnt tove behaved the way I
did that night and it seems to me if theres anything I can do to help
the family I ought to because it would help show I felt the right way
Well what I want to do is to tell this sos to keep the family from
being made a fool of I dont want to see the family just made use of
and twisted around her finger by somebody thats got no more heart than
so much ice and just as sure to bring troubles in the long run asas
Ediths mistake is Well then this is the way it is Ill just tell
you how it looks to me and see if it dont strike you the same way

Within the room Bibbs much annoyed tapped his ear with his pencil He
wished they wouldnt stand talking near his door when he was trying to
write He had just taken from his trunk the manuscript of a poem begun
the preceding Sunday afternoon and he had some ideas he wanted to
fix upon paper before they maliciously seized the first opportunity
to vanish for they were but gossamer Bibbs was pleased with the
beginnings of his poem and if he could carry it through he meant to
dare greatly with ithe would venture it upon an editor For he had
his plan of life now his day would be of manual labor and thinkinghe
could think of his friend and he could think in cadences for poems to
the crashing of the strong machineand if his father turned him out of
home and out of the Works he would work elsewhere and live elsewhere
His father had the right and it mattered very little to Bibbshe faced
the prospect of a workingmans lodginghouse without trepidation He
could find a washstand to write upon he thought and every evening when
he left Mary he would write a little and he would write on holidays and
on Sundayson Sundays in the afternoon In a lodginghouse at least
he wouldnt be interrupted by his sisterinlaws choosing the immediate
vicinity of his door for conversations evidently important to herself
but merely disturbing to him He frowned plaintively wishing he could
think of some polite way of asking her to go away But as she went on
he started violently dropping manuscript and pencil upon the floor

I dont know whether you heard it mother Sheridan she said but
this old Vertrees house next door had been sold on foreclosure and
all THEY got out of it was an agreement that lets em live there a
little longer Roscoe told me and he says he heard Mr Vertrees has
been up and down the streets moren two years tryin to get a job he
could call a position and couldnt land it You heard anything about
it mother Sheridan

Well I DID know they been doin their own housework a good while
back said Mrs Sheridan And now theyre doin the cookin too

Sibyl sent forth a little titter with a sharp edge I hope they find
something to cook She sold her piano mighty quick after Jim died

Bibbs jumped up He was trembling from head to foot and he was dizzyof
all the real things he could never have dreamed in his dream the last
would have been what he heard now He felt that something incredible was
happening and that he was powerless to stop it It seemed to him that
heavy blows were falling on his head and upon Marys it seemed to
him that he and Mary were being struck and beaten physicallyand that
something hideous impended He wanted to shout to Sibyl to be silent
but he could not he could only stand swallowing and trembling

What I think the whole family ought to understand is just this said
Sibyl sharply Those people were so hard up that this Miss Vertrees
started after Bibbs before they knew whether he was INSANE or not
Theyd got a notion he might be from his being in a sanitarium and
Mrs Vertrees ASKED me if he was insane the very first day Bibbs took
the daughter out autoriding She paused a moment looking at Mrs
Sheridan but listening intently There was no sound from within the
room

No exclaimed Mrs Sheridan

Its the truth Sibyl declared loudly Oh of course we were all
crazy about that girl at first We were pretty green when we moved up
here and we thought shed get us INbut it didnt take ME long to read
her Her family were down and out when it came to moneyand they had to
go after it one way or another SOMEHOW So she started for Roscoe but
she found out pretty quick he was married and she turned right around
to Jimand she landed him Theres no doubt about it she had Jim and
if hed lived youd had another daughterinlaw before this as sure as
I stand here telling you the Gods truth about it Wellwhen Jim was
left in the cemetery she was waiting out there to drive home with Bibbs
Jim wasnt COLDand she didnt know whether Bibbs was insane or not
but he was the only one of the rich Sheridan boys left She had to get
him

The texture of what was the truth made an even fabric with what was not
in Sibyls mind she believed every word that she uttered and she spoke
with the rapidity and vehemence of fierce conviction

What I feel about it is she said it oughtnt to be allowed to go
on Its too mean I like poor Bibbs and I dont want to see him made
such a fool of and I dont want to see the family made such a fool of
I like poor Bibbs but if hed only stop to think a minute himself hed
have to realize he isnt the kind of man ANY girl would be apt to fall
in love with Hes betterlooking lately maybe but you know how he
WASjust kind of a long white rag in good clothes And girls like
men with some SO to emSOME sort of dashingness anyhow Nobody ever
looked at poor Bibbs before and neitherd sheno SIR not till shed
tried both Roscoe and Jim first It was only when her and her family got
desperate that she

Bibbswhiter than when he came from the sanitariumopened the door
He stepped across its threshold and stook looking at her Both women
screamed

Oh good heavens cried Sibyl Were you in THERE Oh I wouldnt
She seized Mrs Sheridans arm pulling her toward the stairway Come
on mother Sheridan she urged and as the befuddled and confused lady
obeyed Sibyl left a trail of noisy exclamations Good gracious Oh
I wouldnttoo bad I didnt DREAM he was there I wouldnt hurt his
feelings Not for the world Of course he had to know SOME time But
good heavens

She heard his door close as she and Mrs Sheridan reached the top of
the stairs and she glanced over her shoulder quickly but Bibbs was not
following he had gone back into his room

Hehe lookedoh terrible bad stammered Mrs Sheridan II
wish

Still its a good deal better he knows about it said Sibyl I
shouldnt wonder it might turn out the very best thing could happened
Come on

And completing their descent to the library the two made their
appearance to Roscoe and his father Sibyl at once gave a full and
truthful account of what had taken place repeating her own remarks
and omitting only the fact that it was through her design that Bibbs had
overheard them

But as I told mother Sheridan she said in conclusion it might turn
out for the very best that he did hearjust that way Dont you think
so father Sheridan

He merely grunted in reply and sat rubbing the thick hair on the top
of his head with his left hand and looking at the fire He had given no
sign of being impressed in any manner by her exposure of Mary Vertreess
character but his impassivity did not dismay Sibylit was Bibbs whom
she desired to impress and she was content in that matter

Im sure it was all for the best she said Its over now and
he knows what she is In one way I think it was lucky because just
hearing a thing that way a person can tell its SOand he knows I
havent got any ax to grind except his own good and the good of the
family

Mrs Sheridan went nervously to the door and stood there looking toward
the stairway I wishI wish I knew what he was doin she said He
did look terrible bad It was like something had been done to him
that wasI dont know what I never saw anybody look like he did
He lookedso queer It was like youd She called down the hall
George

Yesm

Were you up in Mr Bibbss room just now

Yesm He ring bell tole me make him fiah in his grate I done buil
him nice fiah I reckon he ain feelin so well Yesm He departed

What do you expect he wants a fire for she asked turning toward her
husband The house is warm as can be I do wish I

Oh quit frettin said Sheridan

Well II kind o wish you hadnt said anything Sibyl I know you
meant it for the best and all but I dont believe it would been so much
harm if

Mother Sheridan you dont mean you WANT that kind of a girl in the
family Why she

I dont know I dont know the troubled woman quavered If he liked
her it seems kind of a pity to spoil it Hes so queer and he hasnt
ever taken much enjoyment And besides I believe the way it was there
was more chance of him bein willin to do what papa wants him to If
she wants to marry him

Sheridan interrupted her with a hooting laugh She dont he said
Youre barkin up the wrong tree Sibyl She aint that kind of a
girl

But father Sheridan didnt she

He cut her short Thats enough You may mean all right but you guess
wrong So do you mamma

Sibyl cried out Oh But just LOOK how she ran after Jim

She did not he said curtly She wouldnt take Jim She turned him
down cold

But thats impossi

Its not I KNOW she did

Sibyl looked flatly incredulous

And YOU neednt worry he said turning to his wife This wont have
any effect on your idea because there wasnt any sense to it anyhow
Dyou think shed be very likely to take Bibbsafter she wouldnt take
JIM Shes a goodhearted girl and she lets Bibbs come to see her
but if shed ever given him one sign of encouragement the way you women
think he wouldnt of acted the stubborn fool he hashed a been at
me long ago beggin me for some kind of a job he could support a wife
on Theres nothin in itand Ive got the same old fight with him on
my hands Ive had all his lifeand the Lord knows what he wont do
to balk me Whats happened nowll probably only make him twice as
stubborn but

SH Mrs Sheridan still in the doorway lifted her hand Thats his
stephes comin downstairs She shrank away from the door as if
she feared to have Bibbs see her II wonder she said almost in a
whisperI wonder what hed gointo do

Her timorousness had its effect upon the others Sheridan rose
frowning but remained standing beside his chair and Roscoe moved
toward Sibyl who stared uneasily at the open doorway They listened as
the slow steps descended the stairs and came toward the library

Bibbs stopped upon the threshold and with sick and haggard eyes looked
slowly from one to the other until at last his gaze rested upon his
father Then he came and stood before him

Im sorry youve had so much trouble with me he said gently You
wont any more Ill take the job you offered me

Sheridan did not speakhe stared astounded and incredulous and Bibbs
had left the room before any of its occupants uttered a sound though he
went as slowly as he came Mrs Sheridan was the first to move She went
nervously back to the doorway and then out into the hall Bibbs had
gone from the house

Bibbss mother had a feeling about him then that she had never known
before it was indefinite and vague but very poignantsomething in her
mourned for him uncomprehendingly She felt that an awful thing had been
done to him though she did not know what it was She went up to his
room

The fire George had built for him was almost smothered under thick
charred ashes of paper The lid of his trunk stood open and the
large upper tray which she remembered to have seen full of papers and
notebooks was empty And somehow she understood that Bibbs had given
up the mysterious vocation he had hoped to followand that he had
given it up for ever She thought it was the wisest thing he could have
doneand yet for an unknown reason she sat upon the bed and wept a
little before she went downstairs

So Sheridan had his way with Bibbs all through



CHAPTER XXIX

As Bibbs came out of the New House a Sunday trio was in course of
passage upon the sidewalk an ample young woman placid of face
a blackclad thin young man whose expression was one of habitual
anxiety habitual wariness and habitual eagerness He propelled a
perambulator containing the thirdand all three were newly cleaned
Sundayfied and made fit to dine with the wifes relatives

Howd you like for me to be THAT young fella mamma the husband
whispered Hes one of the sons and there aint but two left now

The wife stared curiously at Bibbs Well I dont know she returned
He looks to me like he had his own troubles

I expect he has like anybody else said the young husband but I
guess we could stand a good deal if we had his money

Well maybe if you keep on the way you been babyll be as well fixed
as the Sheridans You cant tell She glanced back at Bibbs who had
turned north He walks kind of slow and stooped over like

So much money in his pockets it makes him sag I guess said the young
husband with bitter admiration

Mary happening to glance from a window saw Bibbs coming and she
started clasping her hands together in a sudden alarm She met him at
the door

Bibbs she cried What is the matter I saw something was terribly
wrong when IYou look She paused and he came in not lifting his
eyes to hers Always when he crossed that threshold he had come with
his head up and his wistful gaze seeking hers Ah poor boy she said
with a gesture of understanding and pity I know what it is

He followed her into the room where they always sat and sank into a
chair

You neednt tell me she said Theyve made you give up Your
fathers wonyoure going to do what he wants Youve given up

Still without looking at her he inclined his head in affirmation

She gave a little cry of compassion and came and sat near him Bibbs
she said I can be glad of one thing though its selfish I can be
glad you came straight to me Its more to me than even if youd come
because you were happy She did not speak again for a little while
then she said Bibbsdearcould you tell me about it Do you want
to

Still he did not look up but in a voice shaken and husky he asked her
a question so grotesque that at first she thought she had misunderstood
his words

Mary he said could you marry me

What did you say Bibbs she asked quietly

His tone and attitude did not change Will you marry me

Both of her hands leaped to her cheeksshe grew red and then white
She rose slowly and moved backward from him staring at him at first
incredulously then with an intense perplexity more and more luminous
in her wide eyes it was like a spoken question The room filled with
strangeness in the long silencethe two were so strange to each other
At last she said

What made you say that

He did not answer

Bibbs look at me Her voice was loud and clear What made you say
that Look at me

He could not look at her and he could not speak

What was it that made you she said I want you to tell me

She went closer to him her eyes ever brighter and wider with that
intensity of wonder Youve given upto your father she said
slowly and then you came to ask me She broke off Bibbs do you
want me to marry you

Yes he said just audibly

No she cried You do not Then what made you ask me What is it
thats happened

Nothing

Wait she said Let me think Its something that happened since our
walk this morningyes since you left me at noon Something happened
that She stopped abruptly with a tremulous murmur of amazement and
dawning comprehension She remembered that Sibyl had gone to the New
House

Bibbs swallowed painfully and contrived to say I doI do want you
tomarry me ififyou could

She looked at him and slowly shook her head Bibbs do you Her
voice was as unsteady as hislittle more than a whisper Do you think
Imin love with you

No he said

Somewhere in the still air of the room there was a whispered word it
did not seem to come from Marys parted lips but he was aware of it
Why

Ive had nothing but dreams Bibbs said desolately but they werent
like that Sibyl said no girl could care about me He smiled faintly
though still he did not look at Mary And when I first came home Edith
told me Sibyl was so anxious to marry that shed have married ME She
meant it to express Sibyls extremity you see But I hardly needed
either of them to tell me I hadnt thought of myself aswell not as
particularly captivating

Oddly enough Marys pallor changed to an angry flush Those two she
exclaimed sharply and then with thoroughgoing contempt Lamhorn
Thats like them She turned away went to the bare little black
mantel and stood leaning upon it Presently she asked WHEN did Mrs
Roscoe Sheridan say that no girl could care about you

Today

Mary drew a deep breath I think Im beginning to understanda
little She bit her lip there was anger in good truth in her eyes and
in her voice Answer me once more she said Bibbs do you know now
why I stopped wearing my furs

Yes

I thought so Your sisterinlaw told you didnt she

II heard her say

I think I know what happened now Marys breath came fast and her
voice shook but she spoke rapidly You heard her say more than that
You heard her say that we were bitterly poor and on that account I
tried first to marry your brotherand then But now she faltered and
it was only after a convulsive effort that she was able to go on And
thenthat I tried to marryyou You heard her say thatand you
believe that I dont care for you and that no girl could care for
youbut you think I am in such an extremity as Sibyl wasthat you
And so not wanting me and believing that I could not want youexcept
for my extremityyou took your fathers offer and then came to ask
meto marry you What had I shown you of myself that could make you

Suddenly she sank down kneeling with her face buried in her arms upon
the lap of a chair tears overwhelming her

Mary Mary he cried helplessly Oh NOyouyou dont understand

I do though she sobbed I do

He came and stood beside her You kill me he said I cant make it
plain From the first of your loveliness to me I was all self It was
always you that gave and I that took I was the dependentI did nothing
but lean on you We always talked of me not of you It was all about my
idiotic distresses and troubles I thought of you as a kind of wonderful
being that had no mortal or human suffering except by sympathy You
seemed to lean downout of a rosy cloudto be kind to me I never
dreamed I could do anything for YOU I never dreamed you could need
anything to be done for you by anybody And today I heard thatthat
you

You heard that I needed to marrysome oneanybodywith money she
sobbed And you thought we were soso desperateyou believed that I
had

No he said quickly I didnt believe youd done one kind thing
for mefor that No no no I knew youd NEVER thought of me except
generouslyto give I said I couldnt make it plain he cried
despairingly

Wait She lifted her head and extended her hands to him unconsciously
like a child Help me up Bibbs Then when she was once more upon her
feet she wiped her eyes and smiled upon him ruefully and faintly but
reassuringly as if to tell him in that way that she knew he had
not meant to hurt her And that smile of hers so lamentable but so
faithfully friendly misted his own eyes for his shamefacedness lowered
them no more

Let me tell you what you want to tell me she said You cant
because you cant put it into wordsthey are too humiliating for me
and youre too gentle to say them Tell me though isnt it true You
didnt believe that Id tried to make you fall in love with me

Never Never for an instant

You didnt believe Id tried to make you want to marry me

No no no

I believe it Bibbs You thought that I was fond of you you knew I
cared for youbut you didnt think I might bein love with you
But you thought that I might marry you without being in love with you
because you did believe I had tried to marry your brother and

Mary I only knewfor the first timethat youthat you were

Were desperately poor she said You cant even say that Bibbs it
was true I did try to make Jim want to marry me I did And she sank
down into the chair weeping bitterly again Bibbs was agonized

Mary he groaned I didnt know you COULD cry

Listen she said Listen till I get throughI want you to
understand We were poor and we werent fitted to be We never had
been and we didnt know what to do Wed been almost rich there was
plenty but my father wanted to take advantage of the growth of the
town he wanted to be richer but insteadwell just about the time
your father finished building next door we found we hadnt anything
People say that sometimes meaning that they havent anything in
comparison with other people of their own kind but we really hadnt
anythingwe hadnt anything at all Bibbs And we couldnt DO anything
You might wonder why I didnt try to be a stenographerand I wonder
myself why when a family loses its money people always say the
daughters ought to go and be stenographers Its curiousas if a
wave of the hand made you into a stenographer No Id been raised to be
either married comfortably or a welltodo old maid if I chose not
to marry The poverty came on slowly Bibbs but at last it was all
thereand I didnt know how to be a stenographer I didnt know how
to be anything except a welltodo old maid or somebodys wifeand
I couldnt be a welltodo old maid Then Bibbs I did what Id been
raised to know how to do I went out to be fascinating and be married I
did it openly at least and with a kind of decent honesty I told your
brother I had meant to fascinate him and that I was not in love with
him but I let him think that perhaps I meant to marry him I think I
did mean to marry him I had never cared for anybody and I thought
it might be there really WASNT anything more than a kind of excited
fondness I cant be sure but I think that though I did mean to
marry him I never should have done it because that sort of a marriage
isits sacrilegesomething would have stopped me Something did stop
me it was your sisterinlaw Sibyl She meant no harmbut she was
horrible and she put what I was doing into such horrible wordsand
they were the truthoh I SAW myself She was proposing a miserable
compact with meand I couldnt breathe the air of the same room with
her though Id so cheapened myself she had a right to assume that I
WOULD But I couldnt I left her and I wrote to your brotherjust a
quick scrawl I told him just what Id done I asked his pardon and I
said I would not marry him I posted the letter but he never got it
That was the afternoon he was killed Thats all Bibbs Now you know
what I didand you knowME She pressed her clenched hands tightly
against her eyes leaning far forward her head bowed before him

Bibbs had forgotten himself long ago his heart broke for her Couldnt
youIsnt thereWont you he stammered Mary Im going with
father Isnt there some way you could use the money withoutwithout

She gave a choked little laugh

You gave me something to live for he said You kept me alive I
thinkand Ive hurt you like this

Not youoh no

You could forgive me Mary

Oh a thousand times Her right hand went out in a faltering gesture
and just touched his own for an instant But theres nothing to
forgive

And you cantyou cant

Cant what Bibbs

You couldnt

Marry you she said for him

Yes

No no no She sprang up facing him and without knowing what she
did she set her hands upon his breast pushing him back from her a
little I cant I cant Dont you SEE

Mary

No no And you must go now Bibbs I cant bear any moreplease

MARY

Never never never she cried in a passion of tears You mustnt
come any more I cant see you dear Never never never

Somehow in helpless stumbling obedience to her beseeching gesture he
got himself to the door and out of the house



CHAPTER XXX

Sibyl and Roscoe were upon the point of leaving when Bibbs returned to
the New House He went straight to Sibyl and spoke to her quietly but
so that the others might hear

When you said that if Id stop to think Id realize that no one would
be apt to care enough about me to marry me you were right he said I
thought perhaps you werent and so I asked Miss Vertrees to marry me
It proved what you said of me and disproved what you said of her She
refused

And having thus spoken he quitted the room as straightforwardly as he
had entered it

Hes SO queer Mrs Sheridan gasped Who on earth would thought of
his doin THAT

I told you said her husband grimly

You didnt tell us hed go over there and

I told you she wouldnt have him I told you she wouldnt have JIM
didnt I

Sibyl was altogether taken aback Do you supose its true Do you
suppose she WOULDNT

He didnt look exactly like a young man that had just got things fixed
up fine with his girl said Sheridan Not to me he didnt

But why would

I told you he interrupted angrily she aint that kind of a girl
If you got to have proof well Ill tell you and get it over with
though Id pretty near just as soon not have to talk a whole lot about
my dead boys private affairs She wrote to Jim she couldnt take him
and it was a good straight letter too It came to Jims office he
never saw it She wrote it the afternoon he was hurt

I remember I saw her put a letter in the mailbox that afternoon said
Roscoe Dont you remember Sibyl I told you about itI was waiting
for you while you were in there so long talking to her mother It was
just before we saw that something was wrong over here and Edith came
and called me

Sibyl shook her head but she remembered And she was not cast down
for although some remnants of perplexity were left in her eyes they
were dimmed by an increasing glow of triumph and she departedafter
some further fragmentary discoursevisibly elated After all the
guilty had not been exalted and she perceived vaguely but none the
less surely that her injury had been copiously avenged She bestowed a
contented glance upon the old house with the cupola as she and Roscoe
crossed the street

When they had gone Mrs Sheridan indulged in reverie but after a while
she said uneasily Papa you think it would be any use to tell Bibbs
about that letter

I dont know he answered walking moodily to the window I been
thinkin about it He came to a decision I reckon I will And he
went up to Bibbss room

Well you goin back on what you said he inquired brusquely as he
opened the door You goin to take it back and lay down on me again

No said Bibbs

Well perhaps I didnt have any call to accuse you of that I dont
know as you ever did go back on anything you said exactly though the
Lord knows youve laid down on me enough You certainly have Sheridan
was baffled This was not what he wished to say but his words were
unmanageable he found himself unable to control them and his querulous
abuse went on in spite of him I cant say I expect much of younot
from the way you always been up to nowunless you turn over a new
leaf and I dont see any encouragement to think youre goin to do
THAT If you go down there and show a spark o real GITup I reckon the
whole officell fall in a faint But if youre ever goin to show any
you better begin right at the beginning and begin to show it tomorrow

YesIll try

You better if its in you Sheridan was sheerly nonplussed He had
always been able to say whatever he wished to say but his tongue seemed
bewitched He had come to tell Bibbs about Marys letter and to his own
angry astonishment he found it impossible to do anything except to scold
like a drudgedriver You better come down there with your mind made
up to hustle harder than the hardest workinman thats under you
or youll not get on very good with me I tell you The way to get
aheadand you better set it down in your booksthe way to get ahead is
to do ten times the work of the hardest worker that works FOR you But
you dont know what work is yet All youve ever done was just stand
around and feed a machine a child could handle and then come home
and take a bath and go callin I tell you youre up against a mighty
different proposition now and if youre worth your saltand you never
showed any signs of it yetnot any signs that stuck out enough to bang
somebody on the head and make em sit up and take noticewell I want
to say right here and nowand you better listen because I want to say
just what I DO say I say

He meandered to a full stop His mouth hung open and his mind was a
hopeless blank

Bibbs looked up patientlyan old old look Yes father Im
listening

Thats all said Sheridan frowning heavily Thats all I came to
say and you better seet you remember it

He shook his head warningly and went out closing the door behind him
with a crash However no sound of footsteps indicated his departure
He stopped just outside the door and stood there a minute or more
Then abruptly he turned the knob and exhibited to his son a forehead
liberally covered with perspiration

Look here he said crossly That girl over yonder wrote Jim a
letter

I know said Bibbs She told me

Well I thought you neednt feel so much upset about it The door
closed on his voice as he withdrew but the conclusion of the sentence
was nevertheless audibleif you knew she wouldnt have Jim either

And he stamped his way downstairs to tell his wife to quit her frettin
and not bother him with any more fools errands She was about to
inquire what Bibbs said but after a second thought she decided not
to speak at all She merely murmured a wordless assent and verbal
communication was given over between them for the rest of that
afternoon

Bibbs and his father were gone when Mrs Sheridan woke the next
morning and she had a dreary day She missed Edith woefully and she
worried about what might be taking place in the Sheridan Building She
felt that everything depended on how Bibbs took hold and upon her
husbands return in the evening she seized upon the first opportunity
to ask him how things had gone He was noncommittal What could anybody
tell by the first day Hed seen plenty go at things well enough right
at the start and then blow up Pretty near anybody could show up fair
the first day or so There was a big job ahead This material such as
it wasBibbs in facthad to be broken in to handling the work Roscoe
had done and then at least as an overseer he must take Jims position
in the Realty Company as well He told her to ask him again in a month

But during the course of dinner she gathered from some disjointed
remarks of his that he and Bibbs had lunched together at the small
restaurant where it had been Sheridans custom to lunch with Jim and
she took this to be an encouraging sign Bibbs went to his room as soon
as they left the table and her husband was not communicative after
reading his paper

She became an anxious spectator of Bibbss progress as a man of
business although it was a progress she could glimpse but dimly and
only in the evening through his remarks and his fathers at dinner
Usually Bibbs was silent except when directly addressed but on the
first evening of the third week of his new career he offered an opinion
which had apparently been the subject of previous argument

Id like you to understand just what I meant about those storagerooms
father he said as Jackson placed his coffee before him Abercrombie
agreed with me but you wouldnt listen to him

You can talk if you want to and Ill listen Sheridan returned but
you cant show me that Jim ever took up with a bad thing The roof
fell because it hadnt had time to settle and on account of weather
conditions I want that building put just the way Jim planned it

You cant have it said Bibbs You cant because Jim planned for the
building to stand up and it wont do it The other onethe one that
didnt fallis so shot with cracks we havent dared use it for storage
It wont stand weight Theres only one thing to do get both buildings
down as quickly as we can and build over Bricks the best and cheapest
in the long run for that type

Sheridan looked sarcastic Fine What we goin to do for storagerooms
while were waitin for those few bricks to be laid

Rent Bibbs returned promptly Well lose money if we dont rent
anyhowthey were waiting so long for you to give the warehouse matter
your attention after the roof fell You dont know what an amount of
stuff theyve got piled up on us over there Wed have to rent until
we could patch up those process perilsand the Krivitch Manufacturing
Companys plant is empty right across the street I took an option on
it for us this morning

Sheridans expression was queer Look here he said sharply Did you
go and do that without consulting me

It didnt cost anything said Bibbs Its only until tomorrow
afternoon at two oclock I undertook to convince you before then

Oh you did Sheridans tone was sardonic Well just suppose you
couldnt convince me

I can thoughand I intend to said Bibbs quietly I dont think
you understand the condition of those buildings you want patched up

Now see here said Sheridan with slow emphasis suppose I had my
mind set about this JIM thought theyd stand and suppose it waswell
kind of a matter of sentiment with me to prove he was right

Bibbs looked at him compassionately Im sorry if you have a sentiment
about it father he said But whether you have or not cant make a
difference Youll get other people hurt if you trust that process and
that wont do And if you want a monument to Jim at least you want
one that will stand Besides I dont think you can reasonably defend
sentiment in this particular kind of affair

Oh you dont

No but Im sorry you didnt tell me you felt it

Sheridan was puzzled by his sons tone Why are you sorry he asked
curiously

Because I had the building inspector up there this noon said Bibbs
and I had him condemn both those buildings

What

Hed been afraid to do it before until he heard from usafraid youd
see he lost his job But he cant uncondemn themtheyve got to come
down now

Sheridan gave him a long and piercing stare from beneath lowered brows
Finally he said How long did they give you on that option to convince
me

Until two oclock tomorrow afternoon

All right said Sheridan not relaxing Im convinced

Bibbs jumped up I thought you would be Ill telephone the Krivitch
agent He gave me the option until tomorrow but I told him Id settle
it this evening

Sheridan gazed after him as he left the room and then though his
expression did not alter in the slightest a sound came from him that
startled his wife It had been a long time since she had heard anything
resembling a chuckle from him and this soundalthough it was grim and
drybore that resemblance

She brightened eagerly Looks like he was startin right well dont it
papa

Startin Lord He got me on the hip Why HE knew what I
wantedthats why he had the inspector up there sot hed have me beat
before we even started to talk about it And did you hear him Cant
reasonably defend SENTIMENT And the way he says Us Took an option
for Us Stuff piled up on Us

There was always an alloy for Mrs sheridan I dont just like the way
he looks though papa

Oh theres got to be something Only one chick left at home so you
start to frettin about IT

No Hes changed Theres kind of a settish look to his face and

I guess thats the common sense comin out on him then said
Sheridan Youll see symptoms like that in a good many business men I
expect

Well and he dont have as good color as he was gettin before And
hed begun to fill out some but

Sheridan gave forth another dry chuckle and going round the table to
her patted her upon the shoulder with his left hand his right being
still heavily bandaged though he no longer wore a sling Thats the
way it is with you mammagot to take your frettin out one way if you
dont another

No He dont look well It aint exactly the way he looked when he
begun to get sick that time but he kind o seems to be losin some
way

Yes he may a lost something said Sheridan I expect hes lost a
whole lot o foolishness besides his Godforsaken notions about writin
poetry and

No his wife persisted I mean he looks right peakid And yesterday
when he was settin with us he kept lookin out the window He wasnt
readin

Well why shouldnt he look out the window

He was lookin over there He never read a word all afternoon I dont
believe

Look here said Sheridan Bibbs might a kept goin on over there
the rest of his life moonin on and on but what he heard Sibyl say did
one big thing anyway It woke him up out of his trance Well he had
to go and bust clean out with a bang and that stopped his goin over
there and it stopped his poetry but I reckon hes begun to get pretty
fair pay for what he lost I guess a good many young men have had to get
over worries like his they got to lose SOMETHING if theyre goin
to keep ahead o the procession nowadaysand it kind o looks to me
mamma like Bibbs might keep quite a considerable long way ahead Why a
year from now Ill bet you he wont know there ever WAS such a thing as
poetry And aint he funny He wanted to stick to the shop sos he could
think What he meant was think about something useless Well I guess
hes keepin his mind pretty occupied the other way these days Yes
sir it took a pretty fairsized shock to get him out of his trance but
it certainly did the business He patted his wifes shoulder again and
then without any prefatory symptoms broke into a boisterous laugh

Honest mamma he works like a gorilla



CHAPTER XXI

And so Bibbs sat in the porch of the temple with the moneychangers But
no one came to scourge him forth for this was the temple of Bigness
and the changing of money was holy worship and true religion The
priests wore that settish look Bibbss mother had seen beginning
to develop about his mouth and eyesa wary look which she could not
define but it comes with service at the temple and it was the more
marked upon Bibbs for his sharp awakening to the necessities of that
service

He did as little useless thinking as possible giving himself no time
for it He worked continuously keeping his thoughts still on his work
when he came home at night and he talked of nothing whatever except his
work But he did not sing at it He was often in the streets and people
were not allowed to sing in the streets They might make any manner of
hideous uproarthey could shake buildings they could outthunder the
thunder deafen the deaf and kill the sick with noise or they
could walk the streets or drive through them bawling squawking or
screeching as they chose if the noise was traceably connected with
business though street musicians were not tolerated being considered
a nuisance and an interference A man or woman who went singing for
pleasure through the streetslike a crazy Neopolitanwould have been
stopped and belike locked up for Freedom does not mean that a citizen
is allowed to do every outrageous thing that comes into his head The
streets were dangerous enough in all conscience without any singing
and the Motor Federation issued public warnings declaring that the
pedestrians life was in his own hands and giving directions how to
proceed with the least peril However Bibbs Sheridan had no desire to
sing in the streets or anywhere He had gone to his work with an energy
that for the start at least was bitter and there was no song left in
him

He began to know his active fellowcitizens Here and there among
them he found a leisurely kind soul a relic of the old period
of neighborliness pioneer stock usually and there were
menparticularly among the merchants and manufacturersso honest they
leaned backward reputations sometimes attested by stories of heroic
sacrifices to honor nor were there lacking some instances of generosity
even nobler Here and there too were bookmen in their little
leisure and among the Germans musicmen And these with the others
worshiped Bigness and the growth each man serving for his own sake and
for what he could get out of it but all united in their faith in the
beneficence and glory of their god

To almost all alike that service stood as the most important thing in
life except on occasion of some such vital brief interregnum as the
dangerous illness of a wife or child In the way of relaxation some of
the servers took golf some took fishing some took showsa mixture
of infantile and negroid humor stockings and tin music some took
an occasional debauch some took trips some took cards and some took
nothing The high priests were vigilant to watch that no relaxation
should affect the service When a man attended to anything outside his
business eyes were upon him his credit was in dangerthat is his
life was in danger And the old priests were as ardent as the young
ones the million was as eager to be bigger as the thousand seventy was
as busy as seventeen They strove mightily against one another and
the old priests were the most wary the most plausible and the most
dangerous Bibbs learned he must walk charily among thesehe must wear
a thousand eyes and beware of spiders indeed

And outside the temple itself were the pretenders the swarming thieves
and sharpers and fleecers the sly rascals and the open rascals but
these were feeble folk not dangerous once he knew them and he had
a good guide to point them out to him They were useful sometimes
he learned and many of them served as gobetweens in matters where
business must touch politics He learned also how breweries and
traction companies and banks and other institutions fought one another
for the political control of the city The newspapers he discovered
had lost their ancient political influence especially with the knowing
who looked upon them with a skeptical humor believing the journals
either to be retained partisans like lawyers or else striving to
forward the personal ambitions of their owners The control of the city
lay not with them but was usually obtained by giving the hordes of
negroes ginmoney and by other largesses The revenues of the people
were then distributed as fairly as possible among a great number of men
who had assisted the winning side Names and titles of offices went with
many of the prizes and most of these titleholders were expected to
present a busy appearance at times and indeed some among them did
work honestly and faithfully

Bibbs had been very ignorant All these simple things so well known
and customary astonished him at first and oncein a brief moment
of forgetting that he was done with writinghe thought that if he had
known them and written of them how like a satire the plainest relation
of them must have seemed Strangest of all to him was the vehement and
sincere patriotism On every side he heard itit was a permeation the
newest schoolchild caught it though just from Hungary and learning to
stammer a few words of the local language Everywhere the people shouted
of the power the size the riches and the growth of their city Not
only that they said that the people of their city were the greatest
the finest the strongest the Biggest people on earth They cited no
authorities and felt the need of none being themselves the people thus
celebrated And if the thing was questioned or if it was hinted that
there might be one small virtue in which they were not perfect and
supreme they wasted no time examining themselves to see if what the
critic said was true but fell upon him and hooted him and cursed him
for they were sensitive So Bibbs learning their ways and walking with
them harkened to the voice of the people and served Bigness with them
For the voice of the people is the voice of their god


Sheridan had made the room next to his own into an office for Bibbs
and the door between the two rooms usually stood openthe father had
established that intimacy One morning in February when Bibbs was
alone Sheridan came in some sheets of typewritten memoranda in his
hand

Bibbs he said I dont like to butt in very often this way and when
I do I usually wish I hadntbut for Heavens sake what have you been
buying that ole busted intertraction stock for

Bibbs leaned back from his desk For eleven hundred and fiftyfive
dollars Thats all it cost

Well it aint worth eleven hundred and fiftyfive cents You ought to
know that I dont get your idea That stuffs deadern Adams cat

It might be worth somethingsome day

How

It mightnt be so deadnot if we went into it said Bibbs coolly

Oh Sheridan considered this musingly then he said Whod you buy it
from

A brokerFansmith

Well he must a got it from one o the crowd o poor ninnies that was
soaked with it Dont you know who owned it

Yes I do

Aint sayin though That it Whats the matter

It belonged to Mr Vertrees said Bibbs shortly applying himself to
his desk

So Sheridan gazed down at his sons thin face Excuse me he said
Your business And he went back to his own room But presently he
looked in again

I reckon you wont mind lunchin alone todayhe was shuffling
himself into his overcoatbecause I just thought Id go up to the
house and get THIS over with mamma He glanced apologetically toward
his right hand as it emerged from the sleeve of the overcoat The
bandages had been removed finally that morning revealing but three
fingersthe forefinger and the finger next to it had been amputated
Shes bound to make an awful fuss and better to spoil her lunch than
her dinner Ill be back about two

But he calculated the time of his arrival at the New House so accurately
that Mrs Sheridans lunch was not disturbed and she was rising from
the lonely table when he came into the diningroom He had left his
overcoat in the hall but he kept his hands in his trousers pockets

Whats the matter papa she asked quickly Has anything gone wrong
You aint sick

Me He laughed loudly Me SICK

You had lunch

Didnt want any today You can give me a cup o coffee though

She rang and told George to have coffee made and when he had withdrawn
she said querulously I just know theres something wrong

Nothin in the world he responded heartily taking a seat at the
head of the table I thought Id talk over a notion o mine with you
thats all Its more womenfolks business than what it is mans
anyhow

What about

Why ole Doc Gurney was up at the office this morning awhile

To look at your hand Hows he say its doin

Fine Well he went in and sat around with Bibbs awhile

Mrs Sheridan nodded pessimistically I guess its time you had him
too I KNEW Bibbs

Now mamma hold your horses I wanted him to look Bibbs over BEFORE
anythings the matter You dont suppose Im goin to take any chances
with BIBBS do you Well afterwards I shut the door and I an ole
Gurney had a talk Hes a mighty disagreeable man he rubbed it in on
me what he said about Bibbs havin brains if he ever woke up Then
I thought he must want to get something out o me he go so
flatteringfor a minute Bibbs couldnt help havin business brains
he says bein YOUR son Dont be surprised he saysdont be
surprised at his makin a success he says He couldnt get over his
heredity he couldnt HELP bein a business successonce you got him
into it Its in his blood Yes sir he says it doesnt need MUCH
brains he says an only thirdrate brains at that he says but
it does need a special KIND o brains he says to be a millionaire
I mean he says when a mans given a start If nobody gives him a
start why course hes got to have luck AND the right kind o brains
The only miracle about Bibbs he says is where he got the OTHER kind
o brainsthe brains you made him quit usin and throw away

But whatd he say about his health Mrs Sheridan demanded
impatiently as George placed a cup of coffee before her husband
Sheridan helped himself to cream and sugar and began to sip the coffee

Im comin to that he returned placidly See how easy I manage this
cup with my left hand mamma

You been doin that all winter What did

Its wonderful he interrupted admiringly what a fellow can do with
his left hand I can sign my name with mine now wells I ever could
with my right It came a little hard at first but now honest I
believe I RATHER sign with my left Thats all I ever have to write
anywayjust the signature Rests all dictatin He blew across the
top of the cup unctuously Good coffee mamma Well about Bibbs Ole
Gurney says he believes if Bibbs could somehow get back to the state o
mind he was in about the machineshopthat is if he could some way get
to feelin about business the way he felt about the shopnot the poetry
and writin part but He paused supplementing his remarks with a
motion of his head toward the old house next door He says Bibbs
is older and hardern what he was when he broke down that time and
besides he aint the kind o dreamy way he was thenand I should
say he AINT Id like em to show ME anybody his age thats any wider
awake But he says Bibbss health never need bother us again if

Mrs Sheridan shook her head I dont see any help THAT way You know
yourself she wouldnt have Jim

Whos talkin about her havin anybody But my Lord she might let him
LOOK at her She neednt a got so mad just because he asked her that
she wont let him come in the house any more Hes a mighty funny boy
and some ways I reckon hes pretty near as hard to understand as the
Bible but Gurney kind o got me in the way o thinkin that if
shed let him come back and set around with her an evening or two
sometimesnot reglar I dont meanwhyWell I just thought Id see
what YOUD think of it There aint any way to talk about it to Bibbs
himselfI dont suppose hed let you anyhowbut I thought maybe you
could kind o slip over there some day and sort o fix up to have a
little talk with her and kind o hint around till you see how the land
lays and ask her

ME Mrs Sheridan looked both helpless and frightened No She shook
her head decidedly It wouldnt do any good

You wont try it

I wont risk her turnin me out o the house Some way thats what I
believe she did to Sibyl from what Roscoe said once No I CANTand
whats more itd only make things worse If people find out youre
runnin after em they think youre cheap and then they wont do as
much for you as if you let em alone I dont believe its any use and
I couldnt do it if it was

He sighed with resignation All right mamma Thats all Then in a
livelier tone he said Ole Gurney took the bandages off my hand this
morning All healed up Says I dont need em any more

Why thats splendid papa she cried beaming I was afraidLets
see

She came toward him but he rose still keeping his hand in his pocket
Wait a minute he said smiling Now it may give you just a teeny bit
of a shock but the fact iswell you remember that Sunday when Sibyl
came over here and made all that fuss about nothinit was the day
after I got tired o that statue when Ediths telegram came

Let me see your hand she cried

Now wait he said laughing and pushing her away with his left hand
The truth is mamma that I kind o slipped out on you that morning
when you wasnt lookin and went down to ole Gurneys officehed told
me to you seeand well it doesnt AMOUNT to anything And he held
out for her inspection the mutilated hand You see these days when
its all dictatin anyhow nobodyd mind just a couple o

He had to jump for hershe went over backward For the second time in
her life Mrs Sheridan fainted



CHAPTER XXXII

It was a full hour later when he left her lying upon a couch in her own
room still lamenting intermittently though he assured her with heat
that the fuss she was making irked him far more than his physical
loss He permitted her to think that he meant to return directly to his
office but when he came out to the open air he told the chauffeur in
attendance to await him in front of Mr Vertreess house whither he
himself proceeded on foot

Mr Vertrees had taken the sale of half of his worthless stock as
manna in the wilderness it came from heavenby what agency he did
not particularly question The broker informed him that parties were
interested in getting hold of the stock and that later there might
be a possible increase in the value of the large amount retained by his
client It might go quite a ways up within a year or so he said and
he advised sitting tight with it Mr Vertrees went home and prayed

He rose from his knees feeling that he was surely coming into his own
again It was more than a mere gasp of temporary relief with him and
his wife shared his optimism but Mary would not let him buy back her
piano and as for fursspring was on the way she said But they paid
the butcher the baker and the candlestickmaker and hired a cook
once more It was this servitress who opened the door for Sheridan and
presently assured him that Miss Vertrees would be down

He was not the man to conceal admiration when he felt it and he flushed
and beamed as Mary made her appearance almost upon the heels of the
cook She had a look of apprehension for the first fraction of a second
but it vanished at the sight of him and its place was taken in her eyes
by a soft brilliance while color rushed in her cheeks

Dont be surprised he said Truth is in a way its sort of on
business I looked in here Itll only take a minute I expect

Im sorry said Mary I hoped youd come because were neighbors

He chuckled Neighbors Sometimes people dont see so much o their
neighbors as they used to That is I hear solately

Youll stay long enough to sit down wont you

I guess I could manage that much And they sat down facing each other
and not far apart

Of course it couldnt be called business exactly he said more
gravely Not at all I expect But theres something o yours it seemed
to me I ought to give you and I just thought it was better to bring it
myself and explain how I happened to have it Its thisthis letter you
wrote my boy He extended the letter to her solemnly in his left hand
and she took it gently from him It was in his mail after he was hurt
You knew he never got it I expect

Yes she said in a low voice

He sighed Im glad he didnt Not he added quicklynot but what
you did just right to send it You did You couldnt acted any other way
when it came right down TO it There aint any blame comin to youyou
were aboveboard all through

Mary said Thank you almost in a whisper and with her head bowed
low

Youll have to excuse me for readin it I had to take charge of all
his mail and everything I didnt know the handwritin and I read it
allonce I got started

Im glad you did

Wellhe leaned forward as if to riseI guess thats about all I
just thought you ought to have it

Thank you for bringing it

He looked at her hopefully as if he thought and wished that she might
have something more to say But she seemed not to be aware of this
glance and sat with her eyes fixed sorrowfully upon the floor

Well I expect I better be gettin back to the office he said rising
desperately I toldI told my partner Id be back at two oclock
and I guess hell think Im a poor business man if he catches me behind
time I got to walk the chalk a mighty straight line these dayswith
THAT fellow keepin tabs on me

Mary rose with him Ive always heard YOU were the hard driver

He guffawed derisively Me Im nothin to that partner o mine You
couldnt guess to save your life how he keeps after me to hold up my end
o the job I shouldnt be surprised hed give me the grand bounce some
day and run the whole circus by himself You know how he isonce he
goes AT a thing

No she smiled I didnt know you had a partner Id always heard

He laughed looking away from her Its just my way o speakin o that
boy o mine Bibbs

He stood then expectant staring out into the hall with an air of
careless geniality He felt that she certainly must at least say How
IS Bibbs but she said nothing at all though he waited until the
silence became embarrassing

Well I guess I better be gettin down there he said at last He
might worry

Goodbyand thank you said Mary

For what

For the letter

Oh he said blankly Youre welcome Goodby

Mary put out her hand Goodby

Youll have to excuse my left hand he said I had a little accident
to the other one

She gave a pitying cry as she saw Oh poor Mr Sheridan

Nothin at all Dictate everything nowadays anyhow He laughed
jovially Did anybody tell you how it happened

I heard you hurt your hand but nonot just how

It was this way he began and both as if unconsciously sat down
again You may not know it but I used to worry a good deal about the
youngest o my boysthe one that used to come to see you sometimes
after Jimthat is I mean Bibbs Hes the one I spoke of as my partner
and the truth is thats what its just about goin to amount to one o
these daysif his health holds out Well you remember I expect I
had him on a machine over at a plant o mine and sometimes Id kind o
sneak in there and see how he was gettin along Take a doctor with me
sometimes because Bibbs never WAS so robust you might say Ole Doc
GurneyI guess maybe you know him Tall thin man acts sleepy

Yes

Well one day I an ole Doc Gurney we were in there and I undertook
to show Bibbs how to run his machine He told me to look out but I
wouldnt listen and I didnt look outand thats how I got my hand
hurt tryin to show Bibbs how to do something he knew how to do and
I didnt Made me so mad I just wouldnt even admit to myself it WAS
hurtand so by and by ole Doc Gurney had to take kind o radical
measures with me Hes a right good doctor too Dont you think so
Miss Vertrees

Yes

Yes he is so Sheridan now had the air of a rambling talker and
gossip with all day on his hands Take him on Bibbss case I was
talkin about Bibbss case with him this morning Well youd laugh to
hear the way ole Gurney talks about THAT Course he IS just as much a
friend as he is doctorand he takes as much interest in Bibbs as if
he was in the family He says Bibbs isnt anyways bad off YET and
he thinks he could stand the pace and get fat on it ifwell this is
whatd made YOU laugh if youd been there Miss Vertreeshonest it
would He paused to chuckle and stole a glance at her She was gazing
straight before her at the wall her lips were parted andvisiblyshe
was breathing heavily and quickly He feared that she was growing
furiously angry but he had led to what he wanted to say and he went
on determined now to say it all He leaned forward and altered his
voice to one of confidential friendliness though in it he still
maintained a tone which indicated that ole Doc Gurneys opinion was only
a joke he shared with her Yes sir you certainly would a laughed
Why that ole man thinks YOU got something to do with it Youll have to
blame it on him young lady if it makes you feel like startin out
to whip somebody Hes actually got THIS theory he says Bibbs got to
gettin better while he worked over there at the shop because you kept
him cheered up and feelin good And he says if you could manage to
just stand him hangin around a littlemaybe not much but just
SOMEtimesagain he believed itd do Bibbs a mighty lot o good
Course thats only what the doctor said Me I dont know anything
about that but I can say this muchI never saw any such a MENTAL
improvement in anybody in my life as I have lately in Bibbs I expect
youd find him a good deal more entertaining than what he used to
beand I know its a kind of embarrassing thing to suggest after the
way he piled in over here that day to ask you to stand up before the
preacher with him but accordin to ole Doc GURNEY hes got you on his
brain so bad

Mary jumped Mr Sheridan she exclaimed

He sighed profoundly There I noticed you were gettin mad I
didnt

No no no she cried But I dont understandand I think you dont
What is it you want me to do

He sighed again but this time with relief Well well he said
Youre right Itll be easier to talk plain I ought to known I could
with you all the time I just hoped youd let that boy come and see you
sometimes once more Could you

You dont understand She clasped her hands together in a sorrowful
gesture Yes we must talk plain Bibbs heard that Id tried to make
your oldest son care for me because I was poor and so Bibbs came and
asked me to marry himbecause he was sorry for me And I CANT see him
any more she cried in distress I CANT

Sheridan cleared his throat uncomfortably You mean because he thought
that about you

No no What he thought was TRUE

Wellyou mean he was so much inyou mean he thought so much of you
The words were inconceivably awkward upon Sheridans tongue he seemed
to be in doubt even about pronouncing them but after a ghastly pause he
bravely repeated them You mean he thought so much of you that you just
couldnt stand him around

NO He was sorry for me He cared for me he was fond of me and hed
respected metoo much In the finest way he loved me if you like and
hed have done anything on earth for me as I would for him and as he
knew I would It was beautiful Mr Sheridan she said But the cheap
bad things one has done seem always to come backthey wait and pull
you down when youre happiest Bibbs found me out you see and he
wasnt in love with me at all

He wasnt Well it seems to me he gave up everything he wanted to
doit was fool stuff but he certainly wanted it mighty badhe just
threw it away and walked right up and took the job he swore he never
wouldjust for you And it looks to me as if a man thatd do that
must think quite a heap o the girl he does it for You say it was only
because he was sorry but let me tell you theres only ONE girl he could
feel THAT sorry for Yes sir

No no she said Bibbs isnt like other menhe would do anything
for anybody

Sheridan grinned Perhaps not so much as you think nowadays he
said For instance I got kind of a suspicion he doesnt believe in
sentiment in business But thats neither here nor there What he
wanted was just plain and simple for you to marry him Well I was
afraid his thinkin so much OF you had kind o sickened you of himthe
way it does sometimes But from the way you talk I understand that
aint the trouble He coughed and his voice trembled a little Now
here Miss Vertrees I dont have to tell youbecause you see things
easyI know I got no business comin to you like this but I had to
make Bibbs go my way instead of his ownI had to do it for the sake o
my business and on his own account tooand I expect you got some idea
how it hurt him to give up Well hes made good He didnt come in
halfhearted or mean he came inall the way But there isnt anything
in it to him you can see hes just shut his teeth on it and goin ahead
with dust in his mouth You see one way of lookin at it hes
got nothin to work FOR And it seems to me like it cost him your
friendship and I believehonestthats what hurt him the worst Now
you said wed talk plain Why cant you let him come back

She covered her face desperately with her hands I cant

He rose defeated and looking it

Well I mustnt press you he said gently

At that she cried out and dropped her hands and let him see her face
Ah He was only sorry for me

He gazed at her intently Mary was proud but she had a fatal honesty
and it confessed the truth of her now she was helpless It was so clear
that even Sheridan marveling and amazed was able to see it Then a
change came over him gloom fell from him and he grew radiant

Dont Dont she cried You mustnt

I wont tell him said Sheridan from the doorway I wont tell
anybody anything



CHAPTER XXXIII

There was a heavy townfog that afternoon a smokemist densest in the
sanctuary of the temple The people went about in it busy and dirty
thickening their outside and inside linings of coaltar asphalt
sulphurous acid oil of vitriol and the other familiar things the men
liked to breathe and to have upon their skins and garments and upon
their wives and babies and sweethearts The growth of the city was
visible in the smoke and the noise and the rush There was more smoke
than there had been this day of February a year earlier there was more
noise and the crowds were thickeryet quicker in spite of that The
traffic policeman had a hard time for the people were independentthey
retained some habits of the old markettown period and would cross
the street anywhere and anyhow which not only got them killed more
frequently than if they clung to the legal crossings but kept the
motormen the chauffeurs and the truckdrivers in a stew of profane
nervousness So the traffic policemen led harried lives they themselves
were killed of course with a certain periodicity but their main
trouble was that they could not make the citizens realize that it was
actually and mortally perilous to go about their city It was strange
for there were probably no citizens of any length of residence who had
not personally known either some one who had been killed or injured in
an accident or some one who had accidentally killed or injured others
And yet perhaps it was not strange seeing the sharp preoccupation of
the facesthe people had something on their minds they could not stop
to bother about dirt and danger

Mary Vertrees was not often downtown she had never seen an accident
until this afternoon She had come upon errands for her mother connected
with a timorous refurbishment and as she did these in and out of the
department stores she had an insistent consciousness of the Sheridan
Building From the street anywhere it was almost always in sight like
some monstrous geometrical shadow murkcolored and rising limitlessly
into the swimming heights of the smokemist It was gaunt and grimy
and repellent it had nothing but strength and sizebut in that
consciousness of Marys the great structure may have partaken of beauty
Sheridan had made some of the things he said emphatic enough to remain
with her She went over and over themand they began to seem true
Only ONE girl he could feel THAT sorry for Gurney says hes got you
on his brain so bad The mans clumsy talk began to sing in her heart
The song was begun there when she saw the accident

She was directly opposite the Sheridan Building then waiting for the
traffic to thin before she crossed though other people were risking the
passage darting and halting and dodging parlously Two men came from
the crowd behind her talking earnestly and started across Both wore
black one was tall and broad and thick and the other was taller but
noticeably slender And Mary caught her breath for they were Bibbs and
his father They did not see her and she caught a phrase in Bibbss
mellow voice which had taken a crisper ring Sixtyeight thousand
dollars Not sixtyeight thousand buttons It startled her queerly
and as there was a glimpse of his profile she saw for the first time a
resemblance to his father

She watched them In the middle of the street Bibbs had to step ahead
of his father and the two were separated But the reckless passing of
a truck beyond the second line of rails frightened a group of country
women who were in course of passage they were just in front of Bibbs
and shoved backward upon him violently To extricate himself from them
he stepped back directly in front of a moving trolleycarno place for
absentmindedness but Bibbs was still absorbed in thoughts concerned
with what he had been saying to his father There were shrieks and
yells Bibbs looked the wrong wayand then Mary saw the heavy figure
of Sheridan plunge straight forward in front of the car With
absolute disregard of his own life he hurled himself at Bibbs like a
footballplayer shunting off an opponent and to Mary it seemed
that they both went down together But that was all she could
seeautomobiles trucks and wagons closed in between She made out
that the trolleycar stopped jerkily and she saw a policeman breaking
his way through the instantly condensing crowd while the traffic came
to a standstill and people stood up in automobiles or climbed upon
the hubs and tires of wheels not to miss a chance of seeing anything
horrible

Mary tried to get through it was impossible Other policemen came to
help the first and in a minute or two the traffic was in motion again
The crowd became pliant dispersingthere was no figure upon the
ground and no ambulance came But one of the policemen was detained by
the clinging and beseeching of a gloved hand

What IS the matter lady

Where are they Mary cried

Who Ole man Sheridan I reckon HE wasnt much hurt

His SON

Was that who the other one was I seen him knock himoh hes not bad
off I guess lady The ole man got him out of the way all right The
fender shoved the ole man around some but I reckon he only got shook
up They both went on in the Sheridan Building without any help Excuse
me lady

Sheridan and Bibbs in fact were at that moment in the elevator
ascending Whiskbroom up in the office Sheridan was saying You got
to look out on those corners nowadays I tell you I dont know I got
any call to blow thoughbecause I tried to cross after you did Thats
how I happened to run into you Well you want to remember to look out
after this We were talkin about Murtries askin sixtyeight thousand
flat for that ninetynineyear lease Its his lookout if hed rather
take it that way and I dont know but

No said Bibbs emphatically as the elevator stopped he wont get
it Not from us he wont and Ill show you why I can convince you
in five minutes He followed his father into the office anteroomand
convinced him Then having been diligently brushed by a youth of color
Bibbs went into his own room and closed the door

He was more shaken than he had allowed his father to perceive and his
side was sore where Sheridan had struck him He desired to be alone he
wanted to rub himself and for once to do some useless thinking again
He knew that his father had not happened to run into him he knew that
Sheridan had instantlyand instinctivelyproved that he held his own
life of no account whatever compared to that of his son and heir Bibbs
had been unable to speak of that or to seem to know it for Sheridan
just as instinctively had swept the matter asideas of no importance
since all was wellreverting immediately to business

Bibbs began to think intently of his father He perceived as he
had never perceived before the shadowing of something enormous and
indomitableand lawless not to be daunted by the will of natures
very self laughing at the lightning and at wounds and mutilation
conquering irresistibleand blindly noble For the first time in his
life Bibbs began to understand the meaning of being truly this mans
son

He would be the more truly his son henceforth though as Sheridan said
Bibbs had not come downtown with him meanly or halfheartedly He
had given his word because he had wanted the money simply for Mary
Vertrees in her need And he shivered with horror of himself thinking
how he had gone to her to offer it asking her to marry himwith his
head on his breast in shameful fear that she would accept him He had
not known her the knowing had lost her to him and this had been his
real awakening for he knew now how deep had been that slumber wherein
he dreamily celebrated the superiority of friendship The sleepwalker
had wakened to bitter knowledge of love and life finding himself a
failure in both He had made a burnt offering of his dreams and the
sacrifice had been an unforgivable hurt to Mary All that was left for
him was the work he had not chosen but at least he would not fail in
that though it was indeed no more than dust in his mouth If there
had been anything to work for

He went to the window raised it and let in the uproar of the streets
below He looked down at the blurred hurrying swarms and he looked
across over the roofs with their panting jets of vapor into the vast
foggy heart of the smoke Dizzy traceries of steel were rising dimly
against it chattering with steel on steel and screeching in steam
while tiny figures of men walked on threads in the dull sky Buildings
would overtop the Sheridan Bigness was being served

But what for The old question came to Bibbs with a new despair Here
where his eyes fell had once been green fields and running brooks and
how had the kind earth been despoiled and disfigured The pioneers had
begun the work but in their old age their orators had said for them
that they had toiled and risked and sacrificed that their posterity
might live in peace and wisdom enjoying the fruits of the earth Well
their posterity was hereand there was only turmoil Where was the
promised land It had been promised by the soldiers of all the wars it
had been promised to this generation by the pioneers but here was the
very posterity to whom it had been promised toiling and risking and
sacrificing in turnfor what

The harsh roar of the city came in through the open window continuously
beating upon Bibbss ear until he began to distinguish a pulsation in
ita broken and irregular cadence It seemed to him that it was like
a titanic voice discordant hoarse rustily metallicthe voice of
the god Bigness And the voice summoned Bibbs as it summoned all its
servants

Come and work it seemed to yell Come and work for Me all men By
your youth and your hope I summon you By your age and your despair I
summon you to work for Me yet a little with what strength you have By
your love of home I summon you By your love of woman I summon you By
your hope of children I summon you

You shall be blind slaves of Mine blind to everything but Me your
Master and Driver For your reward you shall gaze only upon my ugliness
You shall give your toil and your lives you shall go mad for love and
worship of my ugliness You shall perish still worshipping Me and your
children shall perish knowing no other god

And then as Bibbs closed the window down tight he heard his fathers
voice booming in the next room he could not distinguish the words but
the tone was exultantand there came the THUMP THUMP of the maimed
hand Bibbs guessed that Sheridan was bragging of the city and of
Bigness to some visitor from outoftown

And he thought how truly Sheridan was the high priest of Bigness But
with the old old thought again What for Bibbs caught a glimmer of
far faint light He saw that Sheridan had all his life struggled
and conquered and must all his life go on struggling and inevitably
conquering as part of a vast impulse not his own Sheridan served
blindlybut was the impulse blind Bibbs asked himself if it was not
he who had been in the greater hurry after all The kiln must be fired
before the vase is glazed and the Acropolis was not crowned with marble
in a day

Then the voice came to him again but there was a strain in it as of
some high music struggling to be born of the turmoil Ugly I am it
seemed to say to him but never forget that I AM a god And the voice
grew in sonorousness and in dignity The highest should serve but so
long as you worship me for my own sake I will not serve you It is man
who makes me ugly by his worship of me If man would let me serve him
I should be beautiful

Looking once more from the window Bibbs sculptured for himselfin
the vague contortions of the smoke and fog above the roofsa gigantic
figure with feet pedestaled upon the great buildings and shoulders
disappearing in the clouds a colossus of steel and wholly blackened
with soot But Bibbs carried his fancy furtherfor there was still a
little poet lingering in the back of his headand he thought that up
over the clouds unseen from below the giant labored with his hands
in the clean sunshine and Bibbs had a glimpse of what he made
thereperhaps for a fellowship of the children of the children that
were children nowa noble and joyous city unbelievably white

It was the telephone that called him from his vision It rang fiercely

He lifted the thing from his desk and answeredand as the small voice
inside it spoke he dropped the receiver with a crash He trembled
violently as he picked it up but he told himself he was wronghe had
been mistakenyet it was a startlingly beautiful voice startlingly
kind too and ineffably like the one he hungered most to hear

Who he said his own voice shakinglike his hand

Mary

He responded with two hushed and incredulous words IS IT

There was a little thrill of pathetic halflaughter in the instrument
BibbsI wanted tojust to see if you

YesMary

I was looking when you were so nearly run over I saw it Bibbs
They said you hadnt been hurt they thought but I wanted to know for
myself

No no I wasnt hurt at allMary It was father who came nearer it
He saved me

Yes I saw but you had fallen I couldnt get through the crowd until
you had gone And I wanted to KNOW

Marywould youhave minded he said

There was a long interval before she answered

Yes

Then why

Yes Bibbs

I dont know what to say he cried Its so wonderful to hear your
voice againIm shaking MaryII dont knowI dont know anything
except that I AM talking to you It IS youMary

Yes Bibbs

MaryIve seen you from my window at homeonly five times since
Isince then You lookedoh how can I tell you It was like a man
chained in a cave catching a glimpse of the blue sky Mary Mary wont
youlet me see you againnear I think I could make you really forgive
meyoud have to

I DIDthen

Nonot reallyor you wouldnt have said you couldnt see me any
more

That wasnt the reason The voice was very low

Mary he said even more tremulously than before I cantyou
COULDNT mean it was becauseyou cant mean it was because youcare

There was no answer

Mary he called huskily If you mean THATyoud let me see
youwouldnt you

And now the voice was so low he could not be sure it spoke at all but
if it did the words were Yes Bibbsdear

But the voice was not in the instrumentit was so gentle and so light
so almost nothing it seemed to be made of airand it came from the
air

Slowly and incredulously he turnedand glory fell upon his shining
eyes The door of his fathers room had opened

Mary stood upon the threshold

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations

have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
