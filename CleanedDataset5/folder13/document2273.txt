CHAPTER I

A MOTORBOAT AUCTION


Where are you going Tom asked Mr Barton Swift of his son as the
young man was slowly pushing his motorcycle out of the yard toward the
country road You look as though you had some object in view

So I have dad Im going over to Lanton

To Lanton What for

I want to have a look at that motorboat

Which boat is that Tom I dont recall your speaking about a boat
over at Lanton What do you want to look at it for

Its the motorboat those fellows had who tried to get away with your
turbine model invention dad The one they used at the old General
Harkness mansion in the woods near the lake and the same boat that
fellow used when he got away from me the day I was chasing him here

Oh yes I remember now But what is the boat doing over at Lanton

Thats where it belongs Its the property of Mr Bently Hastings
The thieves stole it from him and when they ran away from the old
mansion the time Mr Damon and I raided the place they left the boat
on the lake I turned it over to the county authorities and they
found out it belonged to Mr Hastings He has it back now but I
understand its somewhat damaged and he wants to get rid of it Hes
going to sell it at auction today and I thought Id go over and take
a look at it You see

Yes I see Tom exclaimed Mr Swift with a laugh I see what
youre aiming at You want a motorboat and youre going all around
Robin Hoods barn to get at it

No dad I only

Oh I know you Tom my lad interrupted the inventor shaking his
finger at his son who seemed somewhat confused You have a nice
rowing skiff and a sailboat yet you are hankering for a motorboat
Come now own up Arent you

Well dad a motorboat certainly would go fine on Lake Carlopa
Theres plenty of room to speed her and I wonder there arent more of
them I was going to see what Mr Hastings boat would sell for but I
didnt exactly think of buying it Still

But you wouldnt buy a damaged boat would you

It isnt much damaged and in his eagerness the young inventor for
Tom Swift had taken out several patents stood his motorcycle up
against the fence and came closer to his father Its only slightly
damaged he went on I can easily fix it I looked it all over
before I gave it in charge of the authorities and its certainly a
fine boat Its worth nine hundred dollarsor it was when it was new

Thats a good deal of money for a boat and Mr Swift looked serious
for though he was well off he was inclined to be conservative

Oh I shouldnt think of paying that much In fact dad I really had
no idea of bidding at the auction I only thought Id go over and get
an idea of what the boat might sell for Perhaps some day

Tom paused Since his father had begun to question him some new plans
had come into the lads head He looked at his parent and saw a smile
beginning to work around the corners of Mr Swifts lips There was
also a humorous look in the eyes of the older inventor He understood
boys fairly well even if he only had one and he knew Tom perfectly

Would you really like to make a bid on that boat Tom he asked

Would I dad Well The youth did not finish but his father knew
what he meant

I suppose a motorboat would be a nice thing to have on Lake Carlopa
went on Mr Swift musingly You and I could take frequent trips in
it It isnt like a motorcycle only useful for one What do you
suppose the boat will go for Tom

I hardly know Not a high price I believe for motorboats are so
new on our lake that few persons will take a chance on them But if
Mr Hastings is getting another he will not be so particular about
insisting on a high price for the old one Then too the fact that it
is damaged will help to keep the price down though I know I can easily
put it in good shape I would like to make a bid if you think its
all right

Well I guess you may Tom if you really want it You have money of
your own and a motorboat is not a bad investment What do you think
ought to be the limit

Would you consider a hundred and fifty dollars too high

Mr Swift looked at Tom critically He was plainly going over several
matters in his mind and not the least of them was the pluck his son
had shown in getting back some valuable papers and a model from a gang
of thieves The lad certainly was entitled to some reward and to
allow him to get a boat might properly be part of it

I think you could safely go as high as two hundred dollars Tom said
Mr Swift at length That would be my limit on a damaged boat for it
might be better to pay a little more and get a new one However use
your own judgment but dont go over two hundred So the thieves who
made so much trouble for me stole that boat from Mr Hastings eh

Yes and they didnt take much care of it either They damaged the
engine but the hull is in good shape Im ever so glad youll let me
bid on it Ill start right off The auction is at ten oclock and I
havent more than time to get there

Now be careful how you bid Dont raise your own figures as Ive
sometimes seen women and men too do in their excitement Somebody
may go over your head and if he does let them If you get the boat
Ill be very glad on your account But dont bring any of Anson
Morses gang back in it with you Ive seen enough of them

Ill not dad cried Tom as he trundled his motorcycle out of the
gate and into the country road that led to the village of Shopton
where he lived and to Lanton where the auction was to be held The
young inventor had not gone far before he turned back leaving his
machine standing on the side path

Whats the matter asked his father who had started toward one of
several machine shops on the premisesshops where Mr Swift and his
son did inventive work

Guess Id better get a blank check and some money replied Tom as he
entered the house Ill need to pay a deposit if I secure the boat

Thats so Well good luck and with his mind busy on a plan for a
new kind of storage battery the inventor went on to his workroom Tom
got some cash and his checkbook from a small safe he owned and was soon
speeding over the road to Lanton his motorcycle making quite a cloud
of dust While he is thus hurrying along to the auction I will tell
you something about him

Tom Swift son of Barton Swift lived with his father and a motherly
housekeeper Mrs Baggert in a large house on the outskirts of the
town of Shopton in New York State Mr Swift had acquired
considerable wealth from his many inventions and patents but he did
not give up working out his ideas simply because he had plenty of
money Tom followed in the footsteps of his parent and had already
taken out several patents

Shortly before this story opens the youth had become possessed of a
motorcycle in a peculiar fashion As told in the first volume of this
series entitled Tom Swift and His Motorcycle Tom was riding to the
town of Mansburg on an errand for his father one day when he was nearly
run down by a motorcyclist A little later the same motorcyclist who
was a Mr Wakefield Damon of Waterfield collided with a tree near
Toms home and was severely cut and bruised the machine being broken
Tom and his father cared for the injured rider and Mr Damon who was
an eccentric individual was so disheartened by his attempts to ride
the motorcycle that he sold it to Tom for fifty dollars though it had
cost much more

About the same time that Tom bought the motorcycle a firm of rascally
lawyers Smeak  Katch by name had in conjunction with several men
made an attempt to get control of an invention of a turbine motor
perfected by Mr Swift The men who were Ferguson Appleson Anson
Morse Wilson Featherton alias Simpson and Jake Burke alias Happy
Harry who sometimes disguised himself as a tramp tried several times
to steal the model

Their anxiety to get it was due to the fact that they had invested a
large sum in a turbine motor invented by another man but their motor
would not work and they sought to steal Mr Swifts Tom was sent to
Albany on his motorcycle to deliver the model and some valuable papers
to Mr Crawford of the law firm of Reid  Crawford of Washington
attorneys for Mr Swift Mr Crawford had an errand in Albany and had
agreed to meet Tom there with the model

But on the way Tom was attacked by the gang of unscrupulous men and
the model was stolen He was assaulted and carried far away in an
automobile In an attempt to capture the gang in a deserted mansion
in the woods on the shore of Lake Carlopa Tom was aided by Mr Damon
of whom he had purchased the motorcycle The men escaped however
and nothing could be done to punish them

Tom was thinking of the exciting scenes he had passed through about a
month previous as he spun along the road leading to Lanton

I hope I dont meet Happy Harry or any of his gang today mused the
lad as he turned on a little more power to enable his machine to mount
a hill I dont believe theyll attend the auction though It would
be too risky for them

As Tom swung along at a rapid pace he heard behind him the puffing of
an automobile with the muffler cut out He turned and cast a hasty
glance behind

I hope that aint Andy Foger or any of his cronies he said to
himself He might try to run me down just for spite He generally
rushes along with the muffler open so as to attract attention and make
folks think he has a racing car

It was not Andy however as Tom saw a little later as a man passed
him in a big touring car Andy Foger as my readers will recollect
was a redhaired squintyeyed lad with plenty of money and not much
else He and his cronies including Sam Snedecker nearly ran Tom down
one day when the latter was on his bicycle as told in the first
volume of this series Andy had been off on a tour with his chums
during the time when Tom was having such strenuous adventures and had
recently returned

If I can only get that boat mused Tom as he swung back into the
middle of the road after the auto had passed him I certainly will
have lots of fun Ill make a weeks tour of Lake Carlopa and take dad
and Ned Newton with me Ned was Toms most particular chum but as
young Newton was employed in the Shopton bank the lad did not have
much time for pleasure Lake Carlopa was a large body of water and it
would take a moderately powered boat several days to make a complete
circuit of the shore so cut up into bays and inlets was it

In about an hour Tom was at Lanton and as he neared the home of Mr
Hastings which was on the shore of the lake he saw quite a throng
going down toward the boathouse

Therell be some lively bidding thought Tom as he got off his
machine and pushed it ahead of him through the drive and down toward
the river I hope they dont go above two hundred dollars though

Get out the way there called a sudden voice and looking back Tom
saw that an automobile had crept up silently behind him In it were
Andy Foger and Sam Snedecker Why dont you get out the way
petulantly demanded the redhaired lad

Because I dont choose to replied Tom calmly knowing that Andy
would never dare to speed up his machine on the slope leading down to
the lake

Go ahead bump him the young inventor heard Sam whisper

Youd better try it if you want to get the best trouncing you ever
had cried Tom hotly

Hu I spose you think youre going to bid on the boat sneered Andy

Is there any law against it asked Tom

Hu Well youll not get it Im going to take that boat retorted
the squinteyed bully Dad gave me the money to get it

All right answered Tom noncommittally Go ahead Its a free
country

He stood his motorcycle up against a tree and went toward a group of
persons who were surrounding the auctioneer The time had arrived to
start the sale As Tom edged in closer he brushed against a man who
looked at him sharply The lad was just wondering if he had ever seen
the individual before as there seemed to be something strangely
familiar about him when the man turned quickly away as if afraid of
being recognized

Thats odd thought Tom but he had no further time for speculation
as the auctioneer was mounting on a soapbox and had begun to address
the gathering




CHAPTER II

SOME LIVELY BIDDING


Attention people cried the auctioneer Give me your attention for
a few minutes and we will proceed with the business in hand As you
all know I am about to dispose of a fine motorboat the property of
Mr Bently Hastings The reason for disposing of it at auction is
known to most of you but for the benefit of those who do not I will
briefly state them The boat was stolen by a gang of thieves and
recovered recently through the efforts of a young man Thomas Swift
son of Barton Swift our fellowtownsman of Shopton At that moment
the auctioneer Jacob Wood caught sight of Tom in the press and
looking directly at the lad continued

I understand that young Mr Swift is here today and I hope he
intends to bid on this boat If he does the bidding will be lively
for Tom Swift is a lively young man I wish I could say that some of
the men who stole the boat were here today

The auctioneer paused and there were some murmurs from those in the
throng as to why such a wish should be uttered Tom felt some one
moving near him and looking around he saw the same man with whom he
had come in contact before The person seemed desirous of getting out
on the edge of the crowd and Tom felt a return of his vague
suspicions He looked closely at the fellow but could trace no
resemblance to any of the men who had so daringly stolen his fathers
model

The reason I wish they were here today went on Mr Wood is that
the men did some slight damage to the boat and if they were here
today we would make them pay for it However the damage is slight
and can easily be repaired I mention that as Mr Hastings desired me
to Now we will proceed with the bidding and I will say that an
opportunity will first be given all to examine the boat Perhaps Tom
Swift will give us his opinion on the state it is in as we know he is
well qualified to talk about machinery

All eyes were turned on Tom for many knew him

Humph I guess I know as much about boats and motors as he does
sneered Andy Foger He isnt the only one in this crowd Why didnt
the auctioneer ask me

Keep quiet begged Sam Snedecker People are laughing at you Andy

I dont care if they are muttered the sandy haired youth Tom
Swift neednt think hes everything

If you will come down to the dock went on the auctioneer you can
all see the boat and I would be glad to have young Mr Swift give us
the benefit of his advice

The throng trooped down to the lake and blushing somewhat Tom told
what was the matter with the motor and how it could be fixed It was
noticed that there was less enthusiasm over the matter than there had
been for certainly the engine rusty and out of order as it was did
not present an attractive sight Tom noted that the man who had acted
so strangely did not come down to the dock

Guess he cant be much interested in the motor decided Tom

Now then if its all the same to you folks Ill proceed with the
auction here went on Mr Wood You can all see the boat from here
It is as you see a regular family launch and will carry twelve
persons comfortably With a canopy fitted to it a person could cruise
all about the lake and stay out over night for you could sleep on the
seat cushions It is twentyone feet in length and has a
fiveandahalffoot beam the design being what is known as a
compromise stern The motor is a doublecylinder twocycle one of ten
horsepower It has a floatfeed carburetor mechanical oiler and the
ignition system is the jumpsparkthe best for this style of motor
The boat will make ten miles an hour with twelve in and of course
more than that with a lighter load A good deal will depend on the way
the motor is managed

Now as you know Mr Hastings wishes to dispose of the boat partly
because he does not wish to repair it and partly because he has a newer
and larger one The craft which is named CARLOPA by the way cost
originally nine hundred dollars It could not be purchased new today
in many places for a thousand Now what am I offered in its present
condition Will any one make an offer Will you give me five hundred
dollars

The auctioneer paused and looked critically at the throng Several
persons smiled Tom looked worried He had no idea that the price
would start so high

Well perhaps that is a bit stiff went on Mr Wood Shall we say
four hundred dollars Come now Im sure its worth four hundred
Wholl start it at four hundred

No one would and the auctioneer descended to three hundred then to
two and finally as if impatient he called out

Well will any one start at fifty dollars

Instantly there were several cries of I will

I thought you would went on the auctioneer Now we will get down
to work Im offered fifty dollars for this twentyone foot ten
horsepower family launch Will any one make it sixty

Sixty called out Andy Foger in a shrill voice Several turned to
look at him

I didnt know he was going to bid thought Tom He may go above me
Hes got plenty of money and while I have too Im not going to pay
too much for a damaged boat

Sixty Im bid sixtysixty cried Mr Wood in a singsong tone
wholl make it seventy

Sixtyfive spoke a quiet voice at Toms elbow and he turned to see
the mysterious man who had joined the crowd at the edge of the lake

Sixtyfive from the gentleman in the white straw hat called Mr Wood
with a smile at his wit for there were many men wearing white straw
hats the day being a warm one in June

Here whos bidding above me exclaimed Andy as if it was against
the law

I guess youll find a number going ahead of you my young friend
remarked the auctioneer Will you have the goodness not to interrupt
me except when you want to bid

Well I offered sixty said the squinteyed bully while his crony
Sam Snedecker was vainly pulling at his sleeve

I know you did and this gentleman went above you If you want to bid
more you can do so Im offered sixtyfive sixtyfive Im offered for
this boat Will any one make it seventyfive

Mr Wood looked at Tom and our hero thinking it was time for him to
make a bid offered seventy Seventy from Tom Swift cried the
auctioneer There is a lad who knows a motorboat from stem to stern
if those are the right words I dont know much about boats except what
Im told but Tom Swift does Now if he bids you people ought to know
that its all right Im bid seventyseventy Im bid Will any one
make it eighty

Eighty exclaimed Andy Foger after a whispered conference with Sam
I know as much about boats as Tom Swift Ill make it eighty

No side remarks Ill do most of the talking You just bid young
man remarked Mr Wood I have eighty bid for this boateighty
dollars Why my friends I cant understand this I ought to have it
up to three hundred dollars at least But I thank you all the same We
are coming on Im bid eighty

Ninety exclaimed the quiet man at Toms elbow He was continually
fingering his upper lip as though he had a mustache there but his
face was cleanshaven He looked around nervously as he spoke

Ninety called out the auctioneer

Ninetyfive returned Tom Andy Foger scowled at him but the young
inventor only smiled It was evident that the bully did not relish
being bid against He and his crony whispered together again

One hundred called Andy as if no one would dare go above that

Im offered an even hundred resumed Mr Wood We are certainly
coming on A hundred I am bid a hundreda hundreda hundred

And five said the strange man hastily and he seemed to choke as he
uttered the words

Oh come now we ought to have at least tendollar bids from now on
suggested Mr Wood Wont you make it a hundred and ten The
auctioneer looked directly at the man who seemed to shrink back into
the crowd He shook his head cast a sort of despairing look at the
boat and hurried away

Thats queer murmured Tom I guess that was his limit yet if he
wanted the boat badly that wasnt a high price

Whos going ahead of me demanded Andy in loud tones

Keep quiet urged Sam We may get it yet

Yes dont make so many remarks counseled the auctioneer Im bid
a hundred and five Will any one make it a hundred and twentyfive

Tom wondered why the man had not remained to see if his bid was
accepted for no one raised it at once but he hurried off and did not
look back Tom took a sudden resolve

A hundred and twentyfive he called out

Thats what I like to hear exclaimed Mr Wood Now we are doing
business A hundred and twentyfive from Tom Swift Will any one
offer me fifty

Andy and Sam seemed to be having some dispute

Lets make him quit right now suggested Andy in a hoarse whisper

You cant declared Sam

Yes I can Ill go up to my limit right now

And some one will go above youmaybe Tom will was Sams retort

I dont believe he can afford to Andy came back with Im going to
call his bluffs I believe hes only bidding to make others think he
wants it I dont believe hell buy it

Tom heard what was said but did not reply The auctioneer was calling
monotonously Im bid a hundred and twentyfivetwentyfive Will
any one make it fifty

A hundred and fifty sang out Andy and all eyes were directed toward
him

Sixty said Tom quietly

Here you began the redhaired lad You

That will do exclaimed the auctioneer sternly I am offered a
hundred and sixty Now who will give me an advance I want to get the
boat up to two hundred and then the real bidding will begin

Toms heart sank He hoped it would be some time before a two hundred
dollar offer would be heard As for Andy Foger he was almost
speechless with rage He shook off the restraining arm of Sam and
worming his way to the front of the throng exclaimed

Ill give a hundred and seventyfive dollars for that boat

Good cried the auctioneer Thats the way to talk Im offered a
hundred and seventyfive

Eighty said Tom quietly though his heart was beating fast

Well of all began Andy but Sam Snedecker dragged him back

You havent got any more money said the bullys crony Better stop
now

I will not Im going home for more declared Andy I must have
that boat

It will be sold when you get back said Sam

Havent you got any money you can lend me inquired the squinteyed
one scowling in Toms direction No not a bit There some one
raised Toms bid

At that moment a man in the crowd offered a hundred and eightyone
dollars

Small amounts thankfully received said Mr Wood with a laugh Then
the bidding became lively a number making onedollar advances

The price got up to one hundred and ninetyfive dollars and there it
hung for several minutes despite the eloquence of Mr Wood who tried
by all his persuasive powers to get a substantial advance But every
one seemed afraid to bid As for the young inventor he was in a
quandary He could only offer five dollars more and if he bid it in
a lump some one might go to two hundred and five and he would not get
the boat He wished he had secured permission from his father to go
higher yet he knew that as a fair proposition two hundred dollars was
about all the motorboat in its present condition was worth at least
to him Then he made a sudden resolve He thought he might as well
have the suspense over

Two hundred dollars he called boldly

Im offered two hundred repeated Mr Wood That is something like
it Now who will raise that

There was a moment of silence Then the auctioneer swung into an
enthusiastic description of the boat He begged for an advance but
none was made though Toms heart seemed in his throat so afraid was
he that he would not get the CARLOPA

Two hundredtwo hundred droned on Mr Wood I am offered two
hundred Will any of you go any higher He paused a moment and Toms
heart beat harder than ever If not resumed the speaker I will
declare the bidding closed Are you all done Oncetwicethree
times Two hundred dollars Goinggoinggone He clapped his hands
The boat is sold to Thomas Swift for two hundred dollars If hell
step up Ill take his money

There was a laugh as Tom blushingly advanced He passed Andy Foger
who had worked his way over near him

You got the boat sneered the bully and I spose you think you got
ahead of me

Keep quiet begged Sam

I wont exclaimed Andy He outbid me just out of spite and Ill
get even with him You see if I dont

Tom looked Andy Foger straight in the eyes but did not answer and the
redhaired youth turned aside followed by his crony and started
toward his automobile

I congratulate you on your bargain said Mr Wood as Tom proceeded to
make out a check He gave little thought to the threat Andy Foger had
made but the time was coming when he was to remember it well




CHAPTER III

A TIMELY WARNING


Well are you satisfied with your bargain Tom asked Mr Wood when
the formalities about transferring the ownership of the motorboat had
been completed

Oh yes I calculated to pay just what I did

Im glad youre satisfied for Mr Hastings told me to be sure the
purchaser was satisfied Here he comes now I guess he wasnt at the
auction

An elderly gentleman was approaching Mr Wood and Tom Most of the
throng was dispersing but the young inventor noticed that Andy Foger
and Sam Snedecker stood to one side regarding him closely

So you got my boat remarked the former owner of the craft I hope
you will be able to fix it up

Oh I think I shall answered the new owner of the CARLOPA If I
cant father will help me

Yes you have an advantage there Are you going to keep the same
name and Mr Hastings seemed quite interested in what answer the lad
would make

I think not replied Tom Its a good name but I want something
that tells more what a fast boat it is for Im going to make some
changes that will increase the speed

Thats a good idea Call it the Swift

Folks would say I was stuck up if I did that retorted the youth
quickly I think I shall call it the ARROW Thats a good short
name and

Its certainly speedy interrupted Mr Hastings Well now since
youre not going to use the name CARLOPA would you mind if I took it
for my new boat I have a fancy for it

Not in the least said Tom Dont you want the letters from each
side of the bow to put on your new craft

Its very kind of you to offer them and since you will have no need
for them Ill be glad to take them off

Come down to my boat invited Tom using the word my with a proper
pride and Ill take off the brass letters I have a screw driver in
my motorcycle tool bag

As the former and present owners of the ARROW which is the name by
which I shall hereafter designate Toms motorboat walked down toward
the dock where it was moored the young inventor gave a startled cry

Whats the matter asked Mr Hastings

That man See him at my motorboat cried Tom He pointed to the
craft in the lake A man was in the cockpit and seemed to be doing
something to the forward bulkhead which closed off the compartment
holding the gasoline tank

Who is he asked Mr Hastings while Tom started on a run toward the
boat

I dont know Some man who bid on the boat at the auction but who
didnt go high enough answered the lad As he neared the craft the
man sprang out ran along the lakeshore for a short distance and then
disappeared amid the bushes which bordered the estate of Mr Hastings
Tom hurriedly entered the ARROW

Did he do any damage asked Mr Hastings

I guess he didnt have time responded Tom But he was tampering
with the lock on the door of the forward compartment Whats in there

Nothing but the gasoline tank I keep the bulkhead sliding door
locked on general principles I cant imagine what the fellow would
want to open it for Theres nothing of value in there Perhaps he
isnt right in his head Was he a tramp

No he was well dressed but he seemed very nervous during the auction
as if he was disappointed not to have secured the boat Yet what could
he want in that compartment Have you the key to the lock Mr
Hastings

Yes it belongs to you now Mr Swift and the former owner handed it
to Tom who quickly unlocked the compartment He slid back the door
and peered within but all he saw was the big galvanized tank

Nothing in there he could want commented the former owner of the
craft

No agreed Tom in a low voice I dont see what he wanted to open
the door for But the time was to come and not far off when Tom was
to discover quite a mystery connected with the forward compartment of
his boat and the solution of it was fated to bring him into no little
danger

It certainly is odd went on Mr Hastings when after Tom had secured
the screw driver from his motorcycle tool bag he aided the lad in
removing the letters from the bow of the boat Are you sure you dont
know the man

No I never saw him before At first I thought his voice sounded like
one of the members of the Happy Harry gang but when I looked squarely
at him I could not see a bit of resemblance Besides that gang would
not venture again into this neighborhood

No I imagine not Perhaps he was only a curious meddlesome person
I have frequently been bothered by such individuals They want to see
all the working parts of an automobile or motorboat and they dont
care what damage they do by investigating

Tom did not reply but he was pretty certain that the man in question
had more of an object than mere curiosity in tampering with the boat
However he could discover no solution just then and he proceeded with
the work of taking off the letters

What are you going to do with your boat now that you have it asked
Mr Hastings Can you run it down to your dock in the condition in
which it is now

No I shall have to go back home get some tools and fix up the motor
It will take half a day at least I will come back this afternoon
and have the boat at my house by night That is if I may leave it at
your dock here

Certainly as long as you like

The young inventor had many things to think about as he rode toward
home and though he was somewhat puzzled over the actions of the
stranger he forgot about that in anticipating the pleasure he would
have when the motorboat was in running order

Ill take dad off on a cruise about the lake he decided He needs
a rest for hes been working hard and worrying over the theft of the
turbine motor model Ill take Ned Newton for some rides too and he
can bring his camera along and get a lot of pictures Oh Ill have
some jolly sport this summer

Tom was riding swiftly along a quiet country road and was approaching a
steep hill which he could not see until he was close to it owing to a
sharp turn

As he was about to swing around it and coast swiftly down the steep
declivity he was startled by hearing a voice calling to him from the
bushes at the side of the road

Hold on dar hold on Mistah Swift cried a colored man suddenly
popping into view Doant go down dat hill

Why its Eradicate Sampson exclaimed Tom quickly shutting off the
power and applying the brakes Whats the matter Rad Why shouldnt
I go down that hill

Becase Mistah Swift deres a powful monstrous tree trunk right
across de road at a place whar yo caint see it till yo gits right on
top ob it Ef yo done hit dat ar tree on yo lickitysplit machine
yo suah would land in kingdom come Doant go down dat hill

Tom leaped off his machine and approached the colored man Eradicate
Sampson did odd jobs in the neighborhood of Shopton and more than once
Tom had done him favors in repairing his lawn mower or his woodsawing
machine In turn Eradicate had given Tom a valuable clue as to the
hiding place of the model thieves

Howd the log get across the road Rad asked Tom

I dunno Mistah Swift I see it when I come along wid mah mule
Boomerang an I tried t git it outer de way but I couldnt Den I
left Boomerang an mah wagon at de foot ob de hill an I come up heah
t git a long pole t pry de log outer de way I didnt tink nobody
would come along case dis road aint much trabeled

I took it for a short cut said the lad Come on lets take a look
at the log

Leaving his machine at the top of the slope the young inventor
accompanied the colored man down the hill At the foot of it well
hidden from sight of any one who might come riding down was a big log
It was all the way across the road

That never fell there exclaimed Tom in some excitement That never
rolled off a load of logs even if there had been one along which
there wasnt That log was put there

Does yo tink dat Mistah Swift asked Eradicate his eyes getting
big

I certainly do and if you hadnt warned me I might have been
killed

Oh I heard yo lickitysplit machine chugchuggin along when I were
in de bushes lookin for a pryin pole an I hurried out to warn yo
I knowed I could leave Boomerang safe case hes asleep

Im glad you did warn me went on the youth solemnly Then as he
went closer to the log he uttered an exclamation

That has been dragged here by an automobile he cried Its been
done on purpose to injure some one Come on Rad lets see if we
cant find out who did it

Something on the ground caught Toms eye He stooped and picked up a
nickleplated wrench

This may come in handy as evidence he murmured




CHAPTER IV

TOM AND ANDY CLASH


Even a casual observer could have told that an auto had had some part
in dragging the log to the place where it blockaded the road In the
dust were many marks of the big rubber tires and even the imprint of a
rope which had been used to tow the tree trunk

What fo yo tink any one put dat log dere asked the colored man as
he followed Tom Boomerang the mule so called because Eradicate said
you never could tell what he was going to do opened his eyes lazily
and closed them again I dont know why Rad unless they wanted to
wreck an automobile or a wagon Maybe tramps did it for spite

Maybe some one done it to make yo hab trouble Mistah Swift

No I hardly think so I dont know of any one who would want to make
trouble for me and how would they know I was coming this way

Tom suddenly checked himself The memory of the scene at the auction
came back to him and he recalled what Andy Foger had said about
getting even

Which way did dat auto go resumed Eradicate

It came from down the road answered Tom not completing the sentence
he had left unfinished They dragged the log up to the foot of the
hill and left it Then the auto went down this way It was
comparatively easy for a lad of such sharp observation as was Tom to
trace the movements of the vehicle

Den if its down heah maybe we cotch em suggested the colored man

The young inventor did not answer at once He was hurrying along his
eyes on the telltale marks He had proceeded some distance from the
place where the log was when he uttered a cry At the same moment he
hurried from the road toward a thick clump of bushes that were in the
ditch alongside of the highway Reaching them he parted the leaves
and called

Heres the auto Rad

The colored man ran up his eyes wider open than ever There hidden
amid the bushes was a large touring car

Whose am dat asked Eradicate

Tom did not answer He penetrated the underbrush noting where the
broken branches had been bent upright after the forced entrance of the
car the better to hide it The young inventor was seeking some clew
to discover the owner of the machine To this end he climbed up in the
tonneau and was looking about when some one burst in through the screen
of bushes and a voice cried Here you get out of my car

Oh is it your car Andy Foger asked Tom calmly as he recognized his
squinteyed rival I was just beginning to think it was Allow me to
return your wrench and he held out the one he had picked up near the
log The next time you drag trees across the road went on the lad
in the tonneau facing the angry and dismayed Andy Id advise you to
post a notice at the top of the hill so persons riding down will not
be injured

Noticeroadhilllogs stammered Andy turning red under his
freckles

Thats what I said replied Tom coolly

II didnt have anything to do with putting a log across any road
mumbled the bully IIve been off toward the creek

Have you asked Tom with a peculiar smile

I thought you might have been looking for the wrench you dropped near
the log You should be more careful and so should Sam Snedecker whos
hiding outside the bushes went on our hero for he had caught sight
of the form of Andys crony II told him not to do it exclaimed
Sam as he came from his hiding place

Shut up exclaimed Andy desperately

Oh I think I know your secret continued the young inventor You
wanted to get even with me for outbidding you on the motorboat You
watched which road I took and then in your auto you came a shorter
way ahead of me You hauled the log across the foot of the hill
hoping I suppose that my machine would be broken But let me tell
you it was a risky trick Not only might I have been killed but so
would whoever else who happened to drive down the slope over the log
whether in a wagon or automobile Fortunately Eradicate discovered it
in time and warned me I ought to have you arrested but youre not
worth it A good thrashing is what such sneaks as you deserve

You havent got any evidence against us sneered Andy confidently
his old bravado coming back

I have all I want replied Tom You neednt worry Im not going
to tell the police But youve got to do one thing or Ill make you
sorry you ever tried this trick Eradicate will help me so dont
think youre going to escape

You get out of my automobile demanded Andy Ill have you arrested
if you dont

Ill get out because Im ready to but not on account of your
threats retorted Mr Swifts son Heres your wrench Now I want
you and Sam to start up this machine and haul that log out of the way

Spose I wont do it snapped Andy

Then Ill cause your arrest besides thrashing you into the bargain
You can take your choice of removing the log so travelers can pass or
having a good hiding you and Sam Eradicate you take Sam and Ill
tackle Andy

Dont you dare touch me cried the bully but there was a whine in
his tones

You let me alone or Ill tell my father added Sam II didnt
have nothin to do with it anyhow I told Andy it would make trouble
but he made me help him

Say whats the matter with you demanded Andy indignantly of his
crony Do you want to

I wish Id never come with you went on Sam who was beginning to be
frightened

Come now Start up that machine and haul the log out of the way
demanded Tom again

I wont do it retorted the redhaired lad impudently

Yes you will insisted our hero and he took a step toward the
bully They were out of the clump of bushes now and in the roadside
ditch You let me alone almost screamed Andy and in his baffled
rage he rushed at Tom aiming a blow

The young inventor quickly stepped to one side and as the bully
passed him Tom sent out a neat lefthander Andy Foger went down in a
heap on the grass




CHAPTER V

A TEST OF SPEED


Whether Tom or Andy was the most surprised at the happening would be
hard to say The former had not meant to hit so hard and he certainly
did not intend to knock the squinteyed youth down The latters fall
was due as much as anything to his senseless rushing tactics and to
the fact that he slipped on the green grass The bully was up in a
moment however but he knew better than to try conclusions with Tom
again Instead he stood out of reach and spluttered

You just wait Tom Swift You just wait

Well Im waiting responded the other calmly

Ill get even with you went on Andy You think youre smart
because you got ahead of me but Ill get square

Look here burst out the young inventor determinedly taking a step
toward his antagonist at which Andy quickly retreated I dont want
any more of that talk from you Andy Foger Thats twice youve made
threats against me today You put that log across the road and if
you try anything like it for your second attempt Ill make you wish you
hadnt That applies to you too Sam he added glancing at the
other lad

II aint gone to do nothin declared Sam

I told Andy not to put that tree

Keep still cant you shouted the bully Come on Well get even
with him thats all he muttered as he went back into the bushes
where the auto was Andy cranked up and he and his crony getting into
the car were about to start off

Hold on cried Tom Youll take that log from across the road or
Ill have you arrested for obstructing traffic and thats a serious
offense

Im goin to take it away growled Andy Give a fellow a show cant
you

He cast an ugly look at Tom but the latter only smiled It was no
easy task for Sam and Andy to pull the log out of the way as they
could hardly lift it to slip the rope under But they finally managed
it and by the power of the car hauled it to one side Then they
speed off

I clar t gracious dem young fellers am most as mean an contrary as
mah mule Boomerang am sometimes observed Eradicate Only Boomerang
aint quite so mean as dat

I should hope not Rad observed Tom Im ever so much obliged for
your warning I guess Ill be getting home now Come around next
week we have some work for you

Deed an I will replied the colored man Ill come around an
eradicate all de dirt on yo place Mistah Swift Yais sah Is
Eradicate by name and dats my perfessioneradicatin dirt Much
obleeged Ill call around Giddap Boomerang

The mule lazily flicked his ears but did not stir and Tom knowing
the process of arousing the animal would take some time hurried up the
hill to where he had left his motorcycle Eradicate was still engaged
on the task of trying to arouse his steed to a sense of its duty when
the young inventor flashed by on his way home

So now you own a broken motorboat observed Mr Swift when Tom had
related the circumstances of the auction Well now you have it what
are you going to do with it

Fix it first of all replied his son It needs considerable
tinkering up but nothing but what I can do if youll help me

Of course I will Do you think you can get any speed out of it

Well Im not so anxious for speed I want a good comfortable boat
and the ARROW will be that Ive named it you see Im going back to
Lanton this afternoon take some tools along and repair it so I can
run the boat over to here Then Ill get at it and fix it up Ive
got a plan for you dad

What is it asked the inventor his rather tired face lighting up
with interest

Im going to take you on a vacation trip

A vacation trip

Yes you need a rest Youve been working too hard over that
gyroscope invention

Yes Tom I think I have admitted Mr Swift But I am very much
interested in it and I think I can get it to work If I do it will
make a great difference in the control of aeroplanes It will make
them more stable and able to fly in almost any wind But I certainly have
puzzled my brains over some features of it However I dont quite see
what you mean

You need a rest dad said Mr Swifts son kindly I want you to
forget all about patents invention machinery and even the gyroscope
for a week or two When I get my motorboat in shape Im going to take
you and Ned Newton up the lake for a cruise We can camp out or if
we had to we could sleep in the boat Im going to put a canopy on it
and arrange some bunks It will do you good and perhaps new ideas for
your gyroscope may come to you after a rest

Perhaps they will Tom I am certainly tired enough to need a
vacation Its very kind of you to think of me in connection with your
boat But if youre going to get it this afternoon youd better start
if you expect to get back by night I think Mrs Baggert has dinner
ready

After the meal Tom selected a number of tools from his own particular
machine shop and carried them down to the dock on the lake where his
two small boats were tied

Arent you going back on your motorcycle asked his father

No Dad Im going to row over to Lanton and if I can get the ARROW
fixed Ill tow my rowboat back

Very well then you wont be in any danger from Andy Foger I must
speak to his father about him

No dad dont exclaimed the young inventor quickly I can fight
my own battles with Andy I dont fancy he will bother me again right
away

Tom found it more of a task than he had anticipated to get the motor in
shape to run the ARROW back under her own power The magneto was out
of order and the batteries needed renewing while the spark coil had
shortcircuited and took considerable time to adjust But by using
some new dry cells which Mr Hastings gave him and cutting out the
magneto or small dynamo which produces the spark that exploded the
gasoline in the cylinders Tom soon had a fine fat hot spark from
the auxiliary ignition system Then adjusting the timer and throttle
on the engine and seeing that the gasoline tank was filled the lad
started up his motor Mr Hastings helped him but after a few turns
of the flywheel there were no explosions Finally after the
carburetor which is the device where gasoline is mixed with air to
produce an explosive mixture had been adjusted the motor started off
as if it had intended to do so all the while and was only taking its
time about it

The machine doesnt run as smooth as it ought to commented Mr
Hastings No it needs a thorough overhauling agreed the owner of
the ARROW Ill get at it tomorrow and with that he swung out into
the lake towing his rowboat after him

A motorboat of my own exulted Tom as he twirled the steering wheel
and noted how readily the craft answered her helm This is great

He steered down the lake and then turning around went up it a mile or
more before heading for his own dock as he wanted to see how the
engine behaved

With some changes and adjustments I can make this a speedy boat
thought Tom Ill get right at it I shouldnt wonder if I could
make a good showing against Mr Hastings new CARLOPA though his
boats got four cylinders and mine has but two

The lad was proceeding leisurely along the lakeshore near his home
with the motor throttled down to test it at low speed when he heard
some one shout Looking toward the bank Tom saw a man waving his
hands

I wonder what he wants thought our hero as he put the wheel over to
send his craft to shore He heard a moment later for the man on the
bank cried

I say my young friend do you know anything about automobiles Of
course you do or you wouldnt be running a motorboat Bless my very
existence but Im in trouble My machine has stopped on a lonely road
and I cant seem to get it started I happened to hear your boat and I
came here to hail you Bless my coatpockets but I am in trouble Can
you help me Bless my soul and gizzard

Mr Damon exclaimed Tom shutting off the power for he was now near
shore Of course Ill help you Mr Damon for the young inventor
had recognized the eccentric man of whom he had purchased the
motorcycle and who had helped him in rounding up the thieves

Why bless my shoelaces if it isnt Tom Swift exclaimed Mr Damon
who seemed very fond of calling down blessings upon himself or upon
articles of his dress or person

Yes Im here admitted Tom with a laugh

And in a motorboat too Bless my pocketbook but did that run away
with some one who sold it to you cheap

No not exactly and the lad explained how he had come into
possession of it By this time he was ashore and had tied the ARROW to
an overhanging tree Then Tom proceeded to where Mr Damon had left
his stalled automobile The eccentric man was wealthy and his
physician had instructed him to ride about in the car for his health
Tom soon located the trouble The carburetor had become clogged and
it was soon in working order again

Well now that you have a boat I dont suppose you will be riding
about the country so much commented Mr Damon as he got into his car
Bless my sparkplug But if you ever get over to Waterfield where I
live come and see me Its handy to get to by water

Ill come some day promised the lad

Bless my hat band but I hope so went on the eccentric individual as
he prepared to start his car

Tom completed the remainder of the trip to his house without incident
and his father came down to the dock to see the motorboat He agreed
with his son that it was a bargain and that it could easily be put in
fine shape

The youth spent all the next day and part of the following working on
the craft He overhauled the ignition system which was the jumpspark
style cleaned the magneto and adjusted the gasoline and compression
taps so that they fitted better Then he readjusted the rudder lines
tightening them on the steering wheel and looked over the piping from
the gasoline tank

The tank was in the forward compartment and upon inspecting this the
lad concluded to change the plan by which the big galvanized iron box
was held in place He took out the old wooden braces and set them
closer together putting in a few new ones

The tank will not vibrate so when Im going at full speed he
explained to his father

Is that where the strange man was tampering with the lock the day of
the auction asked Mr Swift

Yes but I dont see what he could want in this compartment do you
dad

The inventor got into the boat and looked carefully into the rather
dark space where the tank fitted He went over every inch of it and
pointing to one of the thick wooden blocks that supported the tank
asked

Did you bore that hole in there Tom

No it was there before I touched the braces But it isnt a hole or
rather someone bored it and stopped it up again It doesnt weaken
the brace any

No I suppose not I was just wondering whether that was one of the
new blocks or an old one

Oh an old one Im going to paint them too so in case the water
leaks in or the gasoline leaks out the wood wont be affected A
gasoline tank should vibrate as little as possible if you dont want
it to leak I guess Ill paint the whole interior of this compartment
white then I can see away into the far corners of it

I think thats a good idea commented Mr Swift

It was four days after his purchase of the boat before Tom was ready to
make a long trip in it Up to that time he had gone on short spins not
far from the dock in order to test the engine adjustment The lad
found it was working very well but he decided with a new kind of spark
plugs for the two cylinders that he could get more speed out of it
Finally the forward compartment was painted and a general overhauling
given the hull and Tom was ready to put his boat to a good test

Come on Ned he said to his chum early one evening after Mr Swift
had said he was too tired to go out on a trial run Well see what
the ARROW will do now

From the time Tom started up the motor it was evident that the boat was
going through the water at a rapid rate For a mile or more the two
lads speeded along enjoying it hugely Then Ned exclaimed

Somethings coming behind us

Tom turned his head and looked Then he called out

Its Mr Hastings in his new CARLOPA I wonder if he wants a race

Guess hed have it all his own way suggested Ned

Oh I dont know I can get a little more speed out of my boat

Tom waited until the former owner of the ARROW was up to him

Want a race asked Mr Hastings goodnaturedly

Sure agreed Tom and he shoved the timer ahead to produce quicker
explosions

The ARROW seemed to leap forward and for a moment was ahead of the
CARLOPA but with a motion of his hand to the spark lever Mr Hastings
also increased his speed For a moment the two boats were on even
terms and then the larger and newer one forged ahead Tom had expected
it but he was a little disappointed

Thats doing first rate complimented Mr Hastings as he passed them
Better than I was ever able to make her do even when she was new Tom

This made the present owner of the ARROW feel somewhat consoled He
and Ned ran on for a few miles the CARLOPA in the meanwhile
disappearing from view around a bend Then Tom and his chum turned
around and made for the Swift dock

She certainly is a dandy declared Ned I wish I had one like it

Oh I intend that you shall have plenty of rides in this went on his
friend When you get your vacation you and dad and I are going on a
tour and he explained his plan which it is needless to say met
with Neds hearty approval

Just before going to bed some hours later Tom decided to go down to
the dock to make sure he had shut off the gasoline cock leading from
the tank of his boat to the motor It was a calm early summer night
with a new moon giving a little light and the lad went down to the
lake in his slippers As he neared the boathouse he heard a noise

Water rat he murmured or maybe muskrats I must set some traps

As Tom entered the boathouse he started back in alarm for a bright
light flashed up almost in his eyes

Whos here he cried and at that moment someone sprang out of his
motorboat scrambled into a rowing craft which the youth could dimly
make out in front of the dock and began to pull away quickly

Hold on there cried the young inventor Who are you What do you
want Come back here

The person in the coat returned no answer With his heart doing beats
overtime Tom lighted a lantern and made a hasty examination of the
ARROW It did not appear to have been harmed but a glance showed that
the door of the gasoline compartment had been unlocked and was open
Tom jumped down into his craft

Some one has been at that compartment again he murmured I wonder
if it was the same man who acted so suspiciously at the auction What
can his object be anyhow

The next moment he uttered an exclamation of startled surprise and
picked up something from the bottom of the boat It was a bunch of
keys with a tag attached bearing the owners name

Andy Foger murmured Tom So this is how he was trying to get
even Maybe he started to put a hole in the tank or in my boat




CHAPTER VI

TOWING SOME GIRLS


With a sense of anger mingled with an apprehension lest some harm
should have been done to his craft the owner of the ARROW went
carefully over it He could find nothing wrong The engine was all
right and all that appeared to have been accomplished by the unbidden
visitor was the opening of the locked forward compartment That this
had been done by one of the many keys on Andy Fogers ring was evident

Now what could have been his object mused Tom I should think if
he wanted to put a hole in the boat he would have done it amidships
where the water would have a better chance to come in or perhaps he
wanted to flood it with gasoline and

The idea of fire was in Toms mind and he did not finish his
halfcompleted thought

That may have been it he resumed after a hasty examination of the
gasoline tank to make sure there were no leaks in it To get even
with me for outbidding him on the boat Andy may have wanted to destroy
the ARROW Well of all the mean tricks thats about the limit But
wait until I see him Ive got evidence against him and Tom looked
at the key ring I could almost have him arrested for this

Going outside the boathouse Tom stood on the edge of the dock and
peered into the darkness He could hear the faint sound of someone
rowing across the lake but there was no light

He had one of those electric flash lanterns decided Tom If I
hadnt found his keys I might have thought it was Happy Harry instead
of Andy

The young inventor went back into the house after carefully locking the
boat compartment and detaching from the engine an electrical device
without which the motor in the ARROW could not be started

That will prevent them from running away with my boat anyhow
decided Tom And Ill tell Garret Jackson to keep a sharp watch
tonight Jackson was the engineer at Mr Swifts workshop

Tom told his father of the happening and Mr Swift was properly
indignant He wanted to go at once to see Mr Foger and complain of
Andys act but Tom counseled waiting

Ill attend to Andy myself said the young inventor Hes getting
desperate I guess or he wouldnt try to set the place on fire But
wait until I show him these keys

Bright and early the next morning the owner of the motorboat was down
to the dock inspecting it The engineer who had been on watch part of
the night reported that there had been no disturbance and Tom found
everything all right I wonder if Id better go over and accuse Andy
now or wait until I see him and spring this evidence on him thought
our hero Then he decided it would be better to wait He took the
ARROW out after breakfast his father going on a short spin with him

But I must go back now and work on my gyroscope invention said Mr
Swift when about two hours had been spent on the lake I am making
good progress with it

You need a vacation decided Tom Ill be ready to take you and Ned
in about two weeks He will have two weeks off then and well have
some glorious times together

That afternoon Tom put some new style spark plugs in the cylinders of
his motor and found that he had considerably increased the revolutions
of the engine due to a better explosion being obtained He also made
some minor adjustments and the next day he went out alone for a long
run

Heading up the lake Tom was soon in sight of a popular excursion
resort that was frequently visited by church and Sundayschool
organizations in the vicinity of Shopton The lad saw a number of
rowing craft and a small motorboat circling around opposite the resort
and remarked There must be a picnic at the grove today Guess Ill
run up and take a look

The lad was soon in the midst of quite a flotilla of rowboats most of
them manned by pretty girls or in charge of boys who were giving
sisters their own or some other chaps a trip on the water Tom
throttled his boat down to slow speed and looked with pleasure on the
pretty scene His boat attracted considerable attention for motor
craft were not numerous on Lake Carlopa

As our hero passed a boat containing three very pretty young ladies
Tom heard one of them exclaim

There he is now Thats Tom Swift

Something in the tones of the voice attracted his attention He turned
and saw a browneyed girl smiling at him She bowed and asked
blushing the while

Well have you caught any more runaway horses lately

Runaway horseswhywhat Oh its Miss Nestor exclaimed the lad
recognizing the young lady whose steed he had frightened one day when
he was on his bicycle As told in the first volume of this series the
horse had run away being alarmed at the flashing of Toms wheel and
Miss Mary Nestor of Mansburg was in grave danger

So youve given up the bicycle for the motorboat went on the young
lady

Yes replied Tom with a smile shutting off the power and I havent
had a chance to save any girls since Ive had it

The two boats had drifted close together and Miss Nestor introduced
her two companions to Tom

Dont you want to come in and take a ride he asked

Is it safe asked Jennie Haddon one of the trio

Of course it is Jennie or he wouldnt be out in it said Miss
Nestor hastily Come on lets get in Im just dying for a
motorboat ride

What will we do with our boat asked Katie Carson

Oh I can tow that replied the youth Get right in and Ill take
you all around the lake

Not too far stipulated the girl who had figured in the runaway We
must be back for lunch which will be served in about an hour Our
church and Sundayschool are having a picnic

Maybe Mr Swift will come and have some lunch with us suggested Miss
Carson blushing prettily

Nothing would give me greater pleasure answered Tom and then he
laughed at his formal reply the girls joining in

Wed be glad to have you added Miss Haddon Oh she suddenly
screamed the boats tipping over

Oh no Tom hastened to assure her coming to the side to help her
in It just tilts a bit with the weight of so many on one side It
couldnt capsize if it tried

In another moment the three were in the roomy cockpit and Tom had made
the empty rowboat fast to the stern He was about to start up when
from another boat containing two little girls and two slightly larger
boys came a plaintive cry

Oh mister give us a ride

Sure agreed Tom pleasantly Just fasten your boat to the other
rowboat and Ill tow you

One of the boys did this and then with three pretty girls as his
companions in the ARROW and towing the two boats Tom started off

The girls were very much interested in the craft and asked all sorts of
questions about how the engine operated Tom explained as clearly as
he could how the gasoline exploded in the cylinders about the electric
spark and about the propeller Then when he had finished Miss Haddon
remarked naively

Oh Mr Swift youve explained it beautifully and Im sure if our
teacher in school made things as clear as you have that I could get
along fine I understand all about it except I dont see what makes
the engine go

Oh said Tom faintly and he wondering what would be the best remark
to make under the circumstances when Miss Nestor created a diversion
by looking at her watch and exclaiming

Oh girls its lunch time We must go ashore Will you kindly put
about Mr SwiftI hope that is the proper termandland usis that
right and she looked archly at Tom

Thats perfectly right he admitted with a laugh and a glance into
the girls brown eyes Ill put you ashore at once and he headed
for a small dock

And come yourself to take lunch with us added Miss Haddon

Im afraid I might be in the way stammered Tom II have a pretty
good appetite and

I suppose you think that girls on a picnic dont take much lunch
finished Miss Nestor But I assure you that we have plenty and that
you will be very welcome she added warmly

Yes and Id like to have him explain over again how the engine
works went on Miss Haddon I am so interested

Tom helped the girls out receiving their thanks as well as those of
the children in the second boat But as he walked with the young
ladies through the grove the young inventor registered a mental vow
that he would steer clear of explaining again how a gasoline engine
worked

Now come right over this way to our table invited Miss Nestor I
want you to meet papa and mamma

Tom followed her As he stepped from behind a clump of trees he saw
standing not far away a figure that seemed strangely familiar A
moment later the figure turned and Tom saw Andy Foger confronting him
At the sight of our hero the bully turned red and walked quickly away
while Toms fingers touched the ring of keys in his pocket




CHAPTER VII

A BRUSH WITH ANDY


So unexpected was his encounter with Andy that the young inventor
hardly knew how to act especially since he was a guest of the young
ladies Tom did not want to do or say anything to embarrass them or
make a scene yet he did want to have a talk and a very serious talk
with Andy Foger

Miss Nestor must have noticed Toms sudden start at his glimpse of
Andy for she asked Did you see some one you knew Mr Swift

Yes replied Tom I diderthat is He paused in some confusion

Perhaps youd likethat is preferto go with them instead of taking
lunch with girls who dont know anything about engines she persisted

Oh no indeed Tom hastened to assure her Hethat isthe person
I saw wouldnt care to have me lunch with him and the youth smiled
grimly

Would you like to bring him over to our table inquired Miss Carson
We have plenty for him

No I think that would hardly do continued the lad who tried not to
smile at the picture of the redhaired and squinteyed Andy Foger
making one of a party with the girls The young ladies fortunately had
not noticed the bully who was out of view by this time

Tom was presented to Mr and Mrs Nestor who told him how glad they
were to meet the young man who had been instrumental in saving their
daughter from injury if not death Tom was a bit embarrassed but
bore the praise as well as he could and he was very glad when a
diversion in the shape of lunch occurred

After a meal on tables under the trees in the grove Tom took the girls
and some of their friends out in his motorboat again They covered
several miles around the lake before returning to the picnic ground

As Tom was starting toward home in his boat wondering what had become
of Andy and trying to think of a reason why the bully should attend
anything as tame as a church picnic the object of his thoughts came
strolling through the trees down to the shore of the lake The moment
he saw Tom the redhaired lad started back but the young inventor
leaping out of his boat called out

Hold on there Andy Foger I want to see you and there was menace in
Toms tone

But I dont want to see you retorted the other sulkily Ive got
no use for you

No more have I for you was Toms quick reply But I want to return
you these keys You dropped them in my boat the other night when you
tried to set it afire If I ever catch you

My keys Your boat On fire gasped Andy so plainly astonished
that Tom knew his surprise was genuine

Yes your keys You were a little too quick for me or Id have
caught you at it The next time you pick a lock dont leave your keys
behind you and he held out the jingling ring

Andy Foger advanced slowly He took the bunch of keys and looked at
the tag

They are mine he said slowly as if there was some doubt about it

Of course they are declared Tom I found them where you dropped
themin my boat

Do you mean over at the auction

No I mean down in my boathouse where you sneaked in the other night
and tried to do some damage

The other night cried Andy I never was near your boathouse any
night and I never lost my keys there I lost these the day of the
auction on Mr Hastings ground and Ive been looking for them ever
since

Didnt you sneak in my boathouse the other night and try to do some
mischief Didnt you drop them then

No I didnt retorted Andy earnestly I lost those keys at the
auction and I can prove it to you Look I advertised for them in the
weekly Gazette

The redhaired lad pulled a crumpled paper from his pocket and showed
Tom an advertisement offering a reward of two dollars for a bunch of
keys on a ring supposed to have been lost at the auction on Mr
Hastings grounds in Lanton The finder was to return them to Andy
Foger

Does that look as if I lost the keys in your boathouse demanded the
bully sneeringly I wouldnt have advertised them that way if Id been
trying to keep my visit quiet Besides I can prove that I was out of
town several nights I was over to an entertainment in Mansburg one
night and I didnt get home until two oclock in the morning because
my machine broke down Ask Ned Newton He saw me at the
entertainment

Andys manner was so earnest that Tom could not help believing him
Then there was the evidence of the advertisement Clearly the
squinteyed youth had not been the mysterious visitor to the boathouse
and had not unlocked the forward compartment But if it was not he
who could it have been and how did the keys get there These were
questions which racked Toms brain

You can ask Ned Newton repeated Andy Hell prove that I couldnt
have been near your place if you dont believe me

Oh I believe you all right answered Tom for there could be no
doubting Andys manner even though he and the young inventor were not
on good terms But how did your keys get in my boat

I dont know unless you found them kept them and dropped them
there was the insolent answer

You know better than that exclaimed Tom

Well I owe you a reward of two dollars for giving them back to me
continued the bully patronizingly Here it is and he hauled out
some bills

I dont want your money fired back Tom

But Id like to know who it was that was in my boat

And Id like to know who it was took my keys and Andy stuffed the
money back in his pocket Tom did not answer He was puzzling over a
queer matter and he wanted to be alone and think He turned aside from
the redhaired lad and walked toward his motorboat

Ill give you a surprise in a few days Andy called after him but
Tom did not turn his head nor did he inquire what the surprise might be

Mr Swift was somewhat puzzled when his son related the outcome of the
key incident He agreed with Tom that some one might have found the
ring and kept it and that the same person might have been the one whom
Tom had surprised in the boathouse

But its idle to speculate on it commented the inventor Andy
might have induced some of his chums to act for him in harming your
boat and the key advertisement might have been only a ruse

I hardly think so answered his son shaking his head It strikes
me as being very curious and Im going to see if I cant get at the
bottom of it

But a week or more passed and Tom had no clew In the meanwhile he was
working away at his motorboat installing several improvements

One of these was a better pump which circulated the water around the
cylinders and another was a new system of lubrication under forced
feed

This ought to give me a little more speed reasoned Tom who was not
yet satisfied with his craft Guess Ill take it out for a spin

He was alone in the ARROW taking a long course up the lake when as he
passed a wooded point that concealed from view a sort of bay he heard
the puffing of another motorboat

Maybe thats Mr Hastings thought Tom If I raced with him now I
think the ARROW could give a better account of herself

The young inventor looked at the boat as it came into view It needed
but a glance to show that it was not the CARLOPA Then as it came
nearer Tom saw a familiar figure in ita redhaired squinteyed chap

Andy Foger exclaimed Tom Hes got a motorboat This is the
surprise he spoke of

The boat was rapidly approaching him and he saw that it was painted a
vivid red Then he could make out the name on the bow RED STREAK
Andy was sending the craft toward him at a fast rate

You neednt think youre the only one on this lake who has a gasoline
boat called Andy boastfully This is my new one and the fastest
thing afloat around here I can go all around you Do you want to
race

It was a dare and Tom never took such things when he could
reasonably enter a contest He swung his boat around so as to shoot
alongside of Andy and answered

Yes Ill race you Where to

Down opposite Kolbs dock and back to this point was the answer
Ill give you a start as my engine has three cylinders This is a
racing boat

I dont need any start declared Tom Ill race you on even terms
Go ahead

Both lads adjusted their timers to get more speed The water began to
curl away from the sharp prows the motors exploded faster and faster
The race was on between the ARROW and the RED STREAK




CHAPTER VIII

OFF ON A TRIP


Glancing with critical eyes at the craft of his rival Tom saw that
Andy Foger had a very fine boat The young inventor also realized that
if he was to come anywhere near winning the race he would have to get
the utmost speed out of his engine for the new boat the bully had was
designed primarily for racing while Toms was an allaround pleasure
craft though capable of something in the speed line

Ill be giving you a tow in a few minutes as soon as my engine gets
warmed up sneered Andy

Maybe said Tom and then he crouched down to make as little
resistance as possible to the wind Andy on the contrary sat boldly
upright at the auto steering wheel of his boat

On rushed the two motor craft their prows exactly even and the
propellers tossing up a bulge in the water at their sterns Rapidly
acquiring speed after the two lads had adjusted the timers on their
motors the boats were racing side by side seemingly on even terms

The RED STREAK had a very sharp prow designed to cut through the
water It was of the type known as an automobile launch That is the
engine was located forward under a sort of hood which had two hinged
covers like a bats wings The steeringwheel shaft went through the
forward bulkhead slantingly like the wheel of an auto and was
arranged with gasoline and sparking levers on the center post in a
similar manner At the right of the wheel was a reversing lever by
which the propeller blades could be set at neutral or arranged so as
to drive the boat backward Altogether the RED STREAK was a very fine
boat and had cost considerably more than had Toms even when the
latter was new All these things the young owner of the ARROW thought
of as he steered his craft over the course

I hardly think I can win Tom remarked to himself in a whisper His
boat is too speedy for this one I have a chance though for his
engine is new and I dont believe he understands it as well as I do
mine Then too I am sure I have a better ignition system

But if Tom had any immediate hopes of defeating Andy they were doomed
to disappointment for about two minutes after the race started the RED
STREAK forged slowly ahead

Come on cried the redhaired lad I thought you wanted a race

I do answered the young inventor Were a long way from the dock
yet and weve got to come back

Youll be out of it by the time I get to the dock declared Andy

Indeed it began to look so for the auto boat was now a full length
ahead of Toms craft and there was open water between them But our
hero knew a thing or two about racing though he had not long been a
motorboat owner He adjusted the automatic oiler on the cylinders to
give more lubrication as he intended to get more speed out of his
engine Then he opened the gasoline cock a trifle more and set his
timer forward a few notches to get an earlier spark He was not going
to use the maximum speed just yet but he first wanted to see how the
motor of the ARROW would behave under these conditions To his delight
he saw his boat slowly creeping up on Andys The latter with a
glance over his shoulder saw it too and he advanced his spark His
craft forged ahead but the rate of increase was not equal to Toms
If I can keep up to him I suppose I ought to be glad thought the
young inventor for his boat is away ahead of mine in rating

Through the water the sharp bows cut There were only a few witnesses
to the race but those who were out in boats saw a pretty sight as the
two speedy craft came on toward the dock which was the turning point

Andys boat reached it first and swung about in a wide circle for the
return Tom decided it was time to make his boat do its best so he
set the timer at the limit and the spark coming more quickly
increased the explosions

Up shot the ARROW and straightening out after the turn Toms craft
crept along until it lapped the stern of the RED STREAK Andy looked
back in dismay Then he tried to get more speed out of his engine He
did cause the screw to revolve a little faster and Tom noted that he
was again being left behind Then one of those things which may
happen at any time to a gasoline motor happened to Andys It began
to miss explosions At first it was only occasionally then the misses
became more frequent

The owner of the RED STREAK with one hand on the steering wheel tried
with the other to adjust the motor to get rid of the trouble but he
only made it worse Andys boat began to fall back and Toms to creep
up Frantically Andy worked the gasoline and sparking levers but
without avail At last one cylinder went completely out of service

The two boats were now on even terms and were racing along side by side
toward the wooded point which marked the finish

Ill beat you yet exclaimed Andy fiercely

Better hurry up retorted Tom

But the young inventor was not to have it all his own way With a
freakishness equal to that with which it had ceased to explode the dead
cylinder came to life again and the RED STREAK shot ahead Once more
Andys boat had the lead of a length and the finish of the race was
close at hand The squinteyed lad turned and shouted I told you Id
beat you Want a tow now

It began to look as though Tom would need it but he still had
something in reserve One of the improvements he had put in the ARROW
was a new auxiliary ignition system This he now decided to use

With a quick motion Tom threw over the switch that put it into
operation A hotter fatter spark was at once produced and
adjusting his gasoline cock so that a little more of the fluid would be
drawn in making a richer mixture the owner of the ARROW saw the
craft shoot forward as if like some weary runner new life had been
infused

In vain did Andy frantically try to get more speed out of his motor
He cut out the muffler and the explosions sounded loudly over the
lake But it was no use A minute later the ARROW which had slowly
forged ahead crossed the bows of the RED STREAK opposite the finishing
point and Tom had won the race

Well was that fair our hero called to Andy who had quickly shut
off some of his power as he saw his rivals daring trick Did I beat
you fair

You wouldnt have beaten me if my engine hadnt gone back on me
grumbled Andy chagrin showing on his face Wait until my motor runs
smoother and Ill give you a big handicap and beat you My boats
faster than yours It ought to be It cost fifteen hundred dollars
and its a racer

I guess it doesnt like racing commented Tom as he swung the prow of
his craft down the lake toward his home But he knew there was some
truth in what Andy had said The RED STREAK was a more speedy boat
and with proper handling could have beaten the ARROW That was where
Toms superior knowledge came in useful Just you wait Ill beat you
yet called Andy after the young inventor but the latter made no
answer He was satisfied

Mr Swift was much interested that night in his sons account of the
race

I had no idea yours was such a speedy boat he said

Well it wasnt originally admitted Tom but the improvements I put
on it made it so But dad when are we going on our tour You look
more worn out than Ive seen you in some time not excepting when the
turbine model was stolen Are you worrying over your gyroscope
invention

Somewhat Tom I cant seem to hit on just what I want Its a
difficult problem

Then I tell you what lets do dad Lets drop everything in the
inventive line and go off on a vacation Ill take you up the lake in
my boat and you can spend a week at the Lakeview Hotel at Sandport It
will do you good

What will you do Tom

Oh Ned Newton and I will cruise about and well take you along any
time you want to go Were going to camp out nights or sleep in the
boat if it rains Ive ordered a canopy with side curtains Ned and I
dont care for the hotel life in the summer Will you go

Mr Swift considered a moment He did need a rest for he had been
working hard and his brain was weary with thinking of many problems
His sons program sounded very attractive

I think I will accept said the inventor with a smile When can you
start Tom

In about four days Ned Newton will get his vacation then and Ill
have the canopy on Ill start to work at it tomorrow Then well go
on a trip

Sandport was a summer resort at the extreme southern end of Lake
Carlopa and Mr Swift at once wrote to the Lakeview Hotel there to
engage a room for himself In the meanwhile Tom began to put the
canopy on his boat and arrange for the trip which would take nearly a
whole day Ned Newton was delighted with the prospect of a camping
tour and helped Tom to get ready They took a small tent and plenty of
supplies with some food They did not need to carry many rations as
the shores of the lake were lined with towns and villages where food
could be procured

Finally all was ready for the trip and the night before the start Ned
Newton stayed at Toms house so as to be in readiness for going off
early in the morning The day was all that could be desired Tom
noted as he and his chum hurried down to the dock before breakfast to
put their blankets in the boat As the young inventor entered the
craft he uttered an exclamation

Whats the matter asked Ned

I was sure I locked the sliding door of that forward compartment was
the reply Now its open He looked inside the space occupied by
the gasoline tank and cried out One of the braces is gone Theres
been some one at my boat in the night and they tried to damage her

Much harm done asked Ned anxiously

No none at all to speak of replied Tom I can easily put a new
block under the tank In fact I dont really need all I have But
why should any one take one out and who did it Thats what I want to
know

The two lads looked carefully about the dock and boat for a sign of the
missing block or any clews that might show who had been tampering with
the ARROW but they could find nothing

Maybe the block fell out suggested Ned

It couldnt replied Tom It was one of the new ones I put in
myself and it was nailed fast You can see where its been pried
loose I cant understand it and Tom thought rapidly of several
mysterious occurrences of late in which the strange man at the auction
and the person he had surprised one night in the boathouse had a part

Well it neednt delay our trip resumed the young inventor Maybe
theres a hoodoo around here and it will do us good to get away a few
days Come on well have breakfast get dad and start

A little later the ARROW was puffing away up the lake in the direction
of Sandport




CHAPTER IX

MR SWIFT IS ALARMED


Dont you feel better already dad asked Tom that noon as they
stopped under a leaning overhanging tree for lunch on the shore of the
lake Ill leave it to Ned if you dont look more contented and less
worried

I believe he does agreed the other lad Well I must say I
certainly have enjoyed the outing so far admitted the inventor with a
smile And I havent been bothering about my gyroscope I think Ill
take another sandwich Tom and a few more olives

Thats the way to talk cried the son Your appetite is improving
too If Mrs Baggert could see you shed say so

Oh yes Mrs Baggert I do hope she and Garret will look after the
house and shops well said Mr Swift and the old worried look came
like a shadow over his face

Now dont be thinking of that dad advised Tom Of course
everything will be all right Do you think some of those model thieves
will return and try to get some of your other inventions

I dont know Tom Those men were unscrupulous scoundrels and you
can never tell what they might do to revenge themselves on us for
defeating their plans

Well I guess Garret and Mrs Baggert will look out for them
remarked his son Dont worry

Yes its bad for the digestion added Ned If you dont mind Tom
Ill have some more coffee and another sandwich myself

Nothing the matter with your appetite either commented the young
inventor as he passed the coffee pot and the plate

They were soon on their way again the ARROW making good time up the
lake Tom was at the engine making several minor adjustments to it
while Ned steered Mr Swift reclined on one of the cushioned seats
under the shade of the canopy The young owner of the ARROW looked
over the stretch of water from time to time for a possible sight of
Andy Foger but the RED STREAK was not to be seen The Lakeview Hotel
was reached late that afternoon and the boat was tied up to the dock
while Tom and Ned accompanied Mr Swift to see him comfortably
established in his room

Wont you stay to supper with me invited the inventor to his son and
the latters chum Or do you want to start right in on camp life

I guess well stay to supper and remain at the hotel tonight
decided Tom We got here a little later than I expected and Ned and
I hardly have time to go very far and establish a temporary camp
Well live a life of luxurious ease tonight and begin to be
wanderlusters and get back to nature tomorrow

In the morning Tom and his chum full of enthusiasm for the pleasures
before them started off promising to come back to the hotel in a few
days to see how Mr Swift felt The trip had already done the man good
and his face wore a brighter look

Tom and Ned in the speedy ARROW cruised along the lakeshores all that
morning At noon they went ashore made a temporary camp and arranged
to spend the night there in the tent After this was erected they got
out their fishing tackle and passed the afternoon at that sport having
such good luck that they provided their own supper without having to
depend on canned stuff

They lived this life for three days making a new camp each night
being favored with good weather so that they did not have to sleep in
the boat to keep dry On the afternoon of the third day Tom with a
critical glance at the sky remarked

I shouldnt be surprised if it rained tomorrow Ned

Me either It does look sort of hazy and the wind is in a bad
quarter

Then what do you say to heading for the hotel I fancy dad will be glad
to see us

That suits me We can start camp life again after the storm passes

They started for Sandport that afternoon When within about two miles
of the hotel dock Tom saw just ahead of them a small motorboat Ned
observed it too and called out

Spose thats Andy looking for another race

No the boats too small for his Well put over that way and see who
it is

The other craft did not appear to be moving very rapidly and the ARROW
was soon overhauling it As the two chums came nearer they could hear
the puffing of the motor Tom listened with critical ears

That machine isnt working right he remarked to his chum

At that moment there sounded a loud explosion from the other boat and
at the same time there came over the water a shrill cry of alarm
Thats a girl in that boat exclaimed Ned Maybe shes hurt

No the motor only backfired observed Tom But well go over and
see if we can help her Perhaps she doesnt understand it Girls
dont know much about machinery

A little later the ARROW shot up alongside the other craft which had
come to a stop The two lads could see a girl bending over the motor
twirling the flywheel and trying to get it started Can I help you
asked Tom shutting off the power from his craft

The young lady glanced up Her face was red and she seemed ill at
ease At the sight of the young inventor she uttered an exclamation of
relief

Why Mr Swift she cried Oh Im in such trouble I cant make
the machine work and Im afraid its broken it exploded

Miss Nestor blurted out Tom more surprised evidently to see his
acquaintance of the runaway again than she was at beholding him I
didnt know you ran a motorboat he added I dont said she
simply and helplessly Thats the trouble it wont run

How comes it that you are up here went on Tom

I am stopping with friends who have a cottage near the Lakeview
Hotel They have a motorboat and I got Dick Blythehes the owner of
thisto show me how to run it I thought I knew and I started out a
little while ago At first it went beautifully but a few minutes ago
it blew up oror something dreadful happened

Nothing very dreadful I guess Tom assured her I think I can fix
it He got into the other boat and soon saw what the trouble was
The carburetor had gotten out of adjustment and the gasoline was not
feeding properly The young inventor soon had it in order and
testing the motor found that it worked perfectly

Oh I cant thank you enough cried Miss Nestor with a flash from her
brown eyes that made Toms heart beat double time I was afraid I had
damaged the boat and I knew Dick who is a sort of second cousin of
mine would never forgive me

Theres no harm done Tom assured her But you had better keep near
us on your way back that is if you are going back

Oh indeed I am I was frightened when I found Id come so far away
from shore and then when that explosion took placewell you can
imagine how I felt Indeed I will keep near you Are you stopping
near here If you are I wish youd come and see me you and Mr
Newton she added for Tom had introduced his chum

Ill be very glad to answered our hero and he told how he happened
to be in the neighborhood Ill give you a few lessons in managing a
boat if you like he added

Oh will you That will be lovely I wont tell Dick about it and
Ill surprise him some day by showing him how well I can run his boat

Good idea commented Tom

He started the motor for Miss Nestor having stopped it after his first
test and then with the DOT which was the name of the small boat Miss
Nestor was in following the larger ARROW the run back to the hotel
was made The young lady turned off near the Lakeview dock to go to
the cottage where she was stopping and the lads tied up at the hotel
boathouse

Yes we are in for a storm remarked Tom as he and his chum walked up
toward the hotel I wonder how dad is I hope the outing is doing
him good

There he comes now observed Ned and looking up Tom saw his father
approaching The young inventor was at once struck by the expression
on his parents face Mr Swift looked worried and Tom anxiously
hastened forward to meet him

Whats the matter dad he asked as cheerfully as he could Have you
been figuring over that gyroscope problem again against my express
orders and he laughed a little

No Tom its not the gyroscope thats worrying me

What is it then

Those scoundrels are around again Tom and Mr Swift looked
apprehensively about him

You mean the men who stole the turbine model

Yes I was walking in the woods near the hotel yesterday and I saw
Anson Morse He did not see me for I turned aside as quickly as I had
a glimpse of him He was talking to another man

What sort of a man

Well an ordinary enough individual but I noticed that he had
tattooed on the little finger of his left hand a blue ring

Happy Harry the tramp exclaimed Tom What can he and Morse be
doing here

I dont know Tom but Im worried I wish I was back home Im
afraid something may happen to some of my inventions I want to go
back to Shopton Tom

Nonsense dad Dont worry just because you saw some of your former
enemies Everything is all right at home Mrs Baggert and Garret
Jackson will look after things But if you like I can find out for
you how matters are

How Tom

By taking a run down there in my motorboat I can do it tomorrow
and get back by night if I start early Then you will not worry

All right Tom I wish you would Come up to my room and we will talk
it over Id rather leave you go than telephone as I dont like to
talk of my business over the wire if I can avoid it




CHAPTER X

A CRY FOR HELP


Now dad tell me all about it requested Tom when he and Ned were in
Mr Swifts apartment at the hotel safe from the rain that was
falling How did you happen to see Anson Morse and Happy Harry My
old readers will doubtless remember that the latter was the disguised
tramp who was so vindictive toward Tom while Morse was the man who
endeavored to sneak in Mr Swifts shop and steal a valuable invention

Well Tom proceeded the inventor there isnt much to tell I was
out walking in the woods yesterday and when I was behind a clump of
bushes I heard voices I looked out and there I saw the two men

At first I thought they were trailing me but I saw that they had not
seen me and I didnt see how they could know I was in the
neighborhood So I quietly made my way back to the hotel

Could you hear what they were saying

Not all but they seemed angry over something The man with the blue
ring on his finger asked the other man whether Murdock had been heard
from

Who is Murdock

I dont know unless he is another member of the gang or unless that
is an assumed name

It may be that What else did you hear

The man we know as Morse replied that he hadnt heard from him but
that he suspected Murdock was playing a double game Then the
trampHappy Harryasked this question Have you any clew to the
sparkler And Morse answered No but I think Murdock has hid it
somewhere and is trying to get away with it without giving us our
share Then the two men walked away and I came back to the hotel
finished Mr Swift

Sparkler murmured Tom I wonder what that can be

Thats a slang word for diamonds suggested Ned

So it is In that case dad I think we have nothing to worry about
Those fellows must be going to commit a diamond robbery or perhaps it
has already taken place

The inventor seemed relieved at this theory of his son His face
brightened and he said If they are going to commit a robbery Tom we
ought to notify the police

But if they said that Murdock whoever he is had the sparkler and
was trying to get away with it without giving them their share
wouldnt that indicate that the robbery had already taken place asked
Ned

Thats so agreed Tom But it wont do any harm to tell the hotel
detective that suspicious characters are around no matter if the robbery
has been committed Then he can be on the lookout But I dont think we
have anything to worry about dad Still if you like Ill take a run
down to the house to see that everything is all right though Im sure
it will be found that we have nothing to be alarmed over

Well I will be more relieved if you do said the inventor However
suppose we have a good supper now and you boys can stay at the hotel
tonight Then you and Ned can start off early in the morning

All right agreed Tom but there was a thoughtful look on his face
and he appeared to be planning something that needed careful attention
to details

After supper that night Tom took his chum to one side and asked Would
you mind very much if you didnt make the trip to Shopton with me

No Tom of course not if it will help you any Do you want me to
stay here

I think it will be a good plan I dont like to leave dad alone if
those scoundrels are around Of course hes able to look after
himself but sometimes he gets absent minded from thinking too much
about his inventions

Of course Ill stay here at the hotel This is just as good a
vacation as I could wish

Oh I dont mean all the while Just a day or sountil I come back
I may be here again by tomorrow night and find that my father is
needlessly alarmed Then something may have happened at home and I
would be delayed If I should be Id feel better to know that you
were here

Then Ill stay and if I see any of those men

Youd better steer clear of them advised Tom quickly They are
dangerous customers

All right Then Ill go over and give Miss Nestor lessons on how to
run a motorboat was the smiling response I fancy with what she
and I know we can make out pretty well

Hold on there cried Tom gaily No trespassing you know

Oh Ill just say Im your agent promised Ned with a grin You
cant object to that

No I spose not Well do the best you can She is certainly a nice
girl

Yes but you do seem to turn up at most opportune times Luck is
certainly with you where she is concerned First you save her in a
runaway

After I start the runaway interrupted Tom

Then you take her for a ride in your motorboat and lastly you come
to her relief when she is stalled in the middle of the lake Oh you
certainly are a lucky dog

Never mind Im giving you a show Now lets get to bed early as I
want to get a good start

Tom awoke to find a nasty drizzling rainstorm in progress and the
lake was almost hidden from view by a swirling fog Still he was not
to be daunted from his trip to Shopton by the weather and after a
substantial breakfast he bade his father and Ned goodby and started
off in the ARROW

The canopy he had provided was an efficient protection against the
rain a celluloid window in the forward hanging curtains affording him
a view so that he could steer

Through the mist puffed the boat the motor being throttled down to
medium speed for Tom was not as familiar with the lake as he would
like to have been and he did not want to run aground or into another
craft

He was thinking over what his father had told him about the presence of
the men and vainly wondering what might be their reference to the
sparkler His thoughts also dwelt on the curious removal of the
bracing block from under the gasoline tank of his boat

I shouldnt be surprised but what Andy Foger did that he mused
Some day he and I will have a grand fight and then maybe hell let me
alone Well Ive got other things to think about now The hotel
detective can keep a lookout for the men around the hotel after the
warning I gave him and Ill see that all is right at home

The fog lifted somewhat and Tom put on more speed As he was steering
the boat along near shore he heard off to the woods at his right the
report of a gun It came so suddenly that he jumped involuntarily A
moment later there sounded plainly through the damp air a cry for
help

Some ones hurtshot cried the youth aloud

He turned the boat in toward the bank As he shut off the power from
the motor he heard the cry again

Help Help Help

I must go ashore he exclaimed Probably some one is badly wounded
by a gun

He paused for a moment as the fear came to him that it might be some of
the patent thieves Then dismissing that idea as the ARROWs prow
touched the gravel Tom sprang out drew the boat up a little way
fastened the rope to a tree and hurried off into the dripping woods in
the direction of the voice that was calling for aid




CHAPTER XI

A QUICK RUN


Where are you cried Tom Are you hurt Where are you

Uttering these words after he had hurried into the woods a short
distance the young inventor paused for an answer At first he could
hear nothing but the drip of water from the branches of the trees
then as he listened intently he became aware of a groan not far away

Where are you cried the lad again Ive come to help you Where
are you

He had lost what little fear he had had at first that it might be one
of the unscrupulous gang and came to the conclusion that he might
safely offer to help

Once more the groan sounded and it was followed by a faint voice
speaking

Here I am under the big oak tree Oh whoever you are help me
quickly Im bleeding to death

With the sound of the voice to guide him Tom swung around The appeal
had come from the left and looking in that direction he saw through
the mist a large oak tree Leaping over the underbrush toward it he
caught sight of the wounded man at its foot Beside him lay a gun and
there was a wound in the mans right arm

Who shot you cried Tom hurrying to the side of the man Was it
some of those patent thieves Then realizing that a stranger would
know nothing of the men who had stolen the model Tom prepared to
change the form of his question But before he had an opportunity to
do this the man whose eyes were closed opened them and as he got a
better sight of his face Tom uttered a cry

Why its Mr Duncan exclaimed the lad He had recognized the rich
hunter whom he had first met in the woods that spring shortly after
Happy Harry the tramp had disabled Toms motorcycle Mr Duncan
the young inventor repeated how did you get shot

Is that you Tom Swift asked the gunner Help me please I must
stop this bleeding in my arm Ill tell you about it afterward Wind
something around it tightyour handkerchief will do

The man sighed weakly and his eyes closed again The lad saw the blood
spurting from an ugly wound

I must make a tourniquet the youth exclaimed That will check the
bleeding until I can get him to a doctor

With Tom to think was to act He took out his knife and cut off Mr
Duncans sleeves below the injury slashing through coat and shirts
Then he saw that part of a charge of shot had torn away some of the
large muscular development of the upper arm The hunter seemed to have
fainted and the youth worked quickly Tying his handkerchief above the
wound and inserting a small stone under the cloth so that the pebble
would press on the main artery Tom put a stick in the handkerchief and
began to twist it This had the effect of tightening the linen around
the arm and in a few seconds the lad was glad to see that the blood
had stopped spurting out with every beat of the heart Giving the
tourniquet a few more twists to completely stop the flow of blood Tom
fastened the sticklever in place by a bit of string

Thatsthats better murmured Mr Duncan Now if you can go for a
doctor He had to pause for breath

Ill not leave you here alone while I go for a doctor declared Tom
I have my motorboat on the lake Do you think I could get you down
to it and take you home

Perhapsmaybe Ill be stronger in a moment now that the bleeding
has stopped But notnot homefrighten my wife Take me to the
sanitarium if you cansanitarium up the lake a few miles from here

The unfortunate man who had tried to sit upright had to lean back
against the tree again Tom understood what he meant in spite of the
broken sentences Mr Duncan did not want to be taken home in the
condition he was then in for fear of alarming his wife He wanted to
be taken to the sanitarium and Tom knew where this was a wellknown
resort for the treatment of various diseases and surgical cases It
was about five miles away and on the opposite shore of the lake

Watera drink murmured Mr Duncan

Seeing that his patient would be all right for a few minutes at least
Tom hurried to his motorboat got a cup and filling it with water
from a jug he carried he hastened with it to the hunter The fluid
revived the man wonderfully and now that the bleeding had almost
completely stopped Mr Duncan was much stronger

Do you think you can get to the boat if I help you asked Tom

Yes I believe so To think of meeting you again and under such
circumstances It is providential

Did someone shoot you inquired Tom who could not get out of his
head the notion of the men who had once assaulted him

No I shot myself answered Mr Duncan as he got to his feet with
Toms help I was out with my gun practicing just as I was that day
when I met you in the woods I stooped down to crawl under a bush and
the weapon went off the muzzle being close against my arm I cant
understand how it happened I fell down and called for help Then I
guess I must have fainted but I came to when I heard you talking to
me I shouldnt have come out today as it is so wet but I had some
new shot shells I wished to try in order to test them before the
hunting season But if I can get to the sanitarium I will be well
taken care of I know one of the doctors there

With Tom leading him and acting as a sort of support the journey to
the motorboat was slowly made Making as comfortable a bed as
possible out of the seat cushions Tom assisted Mr Duncan to it and
then starting the engine he sent his boat out from shore at half speed
as the fog was still thick and he did not want to run upon a rock

Do you know where the sanitarium is asked the wounded hunter

About answered Tom a little doubtfully but Im afraid its going
to be hard to locate it in this fog

Theres a compass in my coat pocket said Mr Duncan Take it out
and Ill tell you how to steer You ought to carry a compass if youre
going to be a sailor

Tom was beginning to think so himself and wondered that he had not
thought of it before He found the one the hunter had and placing it
on the seat near him he carefully listened to the wounded mans
directions Tom easily comprehended and soon had the boat headed in
the proper direction After that it was comparatively easy to keep on
the right course even in the fog

But there was another danger however and this was that he might run
into another boat True there were not many on Lake Carlopa but
there were some and one of the few motorboats might be out in spite
of the bad weather

Guess Ill not run at full speed decided Tom I wouldnt like to
crash into the RED STREAK Wed both sink

So he did not run his motor at the limit and sat at the steeringwheel
peering ahead into the fog for the first sight of another craft

He turned to look at Mr Duncan and was alarmed at the pallor of his
face The mans eyes were closed and he was breathing in a peculiar
manner

Mr Duncan cried Tom are you worse

There was no answer Leaving the helm for a moment Tom bent over the
injured hunter A glance showed him what had happened The tourniquet
had slipped and the wound was bleeding again Tom quickly shut off the
motor so that he might give his whole attention to the work of
tightening the handkerchief But something seemed to be wrong No
matter how tightly he twisted the stick the blood did not stop flowing
The lad was frightened In a short time the man would bleed to death

Ive got to get him to the sanitarium in record time exclaimed Tom
Fog or no fog Ive got to run at full speed Ive got to chance it

Making the bandage as tight as he could and fastening it in place the
young inventor sprang to the motor and set it in motion Then he went
to the wheel In a few minutes the ARROW was speeding through the
water as it had never done before except when it had raced the RED
STREAK If I hit anythinggoodby thought Tom grimly His hands
were tense on the rim of the steeringwheel and he was ready in an
instant to reverse the motor as he sat there straining his eyes to see
through the curtain of mist that hung over the lake Now and then he
glanced at the compass to keep on the right course and from time to
time he looked at Mr Duncan The hunter was still unconscious

How Tom accomplished that trip he hardly remembered afterward Through
the fog he shot expecting any moment to crash into some other boat
He did pass a rowing craft in which sat a lone fisherman The lad was
upon him in an instant but a turn of the wheel sent the ARROW safely
past and the startled fisherman whose frail craft was set to rocking
violently by the swell from the motorboat sent an objecting cry
through the fog after Tom But the youth did not reply On and on he
raced getting the last atom of power from his motor

He feared Mr Duncan would be dead when he arrived but when he saw the
dock of the sanitarium looming up out of the mist and shut off the
power to slowly run up to it he placed his hand on the wounded mans
heart and found it still beating

Hes alive anyhow thought the youth and then his craft bumped up
against the bulkhead and a man in the boathouse on the dock was sent on
the run for a physician

Mr Duncan was quickly taken up to the sanitarium on a stretcher and
Tom followed

You must have made a record run observed one of the physicians a
little while afterward when Tom was telling of his trip while waiting
in the office to hear the report on the hunters condition

I guess I did muttered the young inventor only I didnt think so at
the time It seemed as if we were only crawling along




CHAPTER XII

SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS


Under the skill of the physicians at the lake sanitarium Mr Duncans
wound was quickly attended to and the bleeding which Tom had partly
checked was completely stopped Some medicines having been
administered the hunter regained a little of his strength and about
an hour after he had been brought to the resort he was able to see
Tom who at his request was admitted to his room The young inventor
found Mr Duncan propped up in bed with his injured arm bandaged

Is the injury a bad one asked Tom entering softly

Not as bad as I feared replied the hunter while a trained nurse
placed a chair for the lad at the bedside If it had not been for
you though Im afraid to think of what might have happened

I am glad I chanced to be going past when you called replied the lad

Well you can imagine how thankful I am resumed Mr Duncan Ill
thank you more properly at another time I hope I didnt delay you on
your trip

Its not of much consequence responded the youth I was only going
to see that everything was all right at our house and he explained
about his father being at the hotel and mentioned his worriment I
will go on now unless I can do something more for you resumed Tom
I will probably stay at our house all night tonight instead of trying
to get back to Sandport

Id like to send word to my wife about what has happened said the
hunter If it would not be too much out of your way Id appreciate
it if you could stop at my home in Waterford and tell her so she will
not be alarmed at my absence

Ill do it replied our hero There is no special need of my
hurrying I have brought your gun and compass up from the boat They
are down in the office

Will you do me a favor asked Mr Duncan quickly

Of course

Then please accept that gun and compass with my compliments They are
both of excellent make and I dont think I shall use that gun this
season My wife would be superstitious about it As for the compass
youll need one in this fog and I can recommend mine as being
accurate

Oh I couldnt think of taking them expostulated Tom but his eyes
sparkled in anticipation for he had been wishing for a gun such as Mr
Duncan owned He also needed a compass

If you dont take them I shall feel very much offended the hunter
said and the nurse here will tell you that sick persons ought to be
humored Hadnt they and he appealed to the pretty young woman who
was smiling at Tom

Thats perfectly true she said showing her white even teeth I
think Mr Swift I shall have to order you to take them

All right agreed Tom only its too much for what I did

It isnt half enough remarked Mr Duncan solemnly Just explain
matters to my wife if you will and tell her the doctor says I can be
out in about a week But Im not going hunting or practicing shots
again

A little later Tom with the compass before him to guide him on his
course through the fog was speeding his boat toward Waterford Now
and then he glanced at the fine shotgun which he had so unexpectedly
acquired

This will come in handy this fall he exclaimed Ill go hunting
quail and partridge as well as wild ducks This compass is just what I
need too

Mrs Duncan was at first very much alarmed when Tom started to tell her
of the accident but she soon calmed down as the lad went more into
details and stated how comparatively out of danger her husband now was
The hunters wife insisted that Tom remain to dinner and as he had
made up his mind he would have to devote two days instead of one to the
trip to his house he consented

The fog lifted that afternoon and Tom rejoicing in the sunlight
which drove away the storm clouds speeded up the ARROW until she was
skimming over the lake like a shaft from a bow

This is something like he exclaimed Ill soon be at home find
everything all right and telephone to dad Then Ill sleep in my own
room and start back in the morning

When Tom was within a few miles of his own boathouse he heard behind
him the putput of a motor craft Turning he saw the RED STREAK
fairly flying along at some distance from him

Andy certainly is getting the speed out of her now he remarked
Hed beat me if we were racing but the trouble with his boat and
engine is that he cant always depend on it I guess he doesnt
understand how to run it I wonder if hell offer to race now

But the redhaired owner of the auto boat evidently did not intend to
offer Tom a race The RED STREAK went on down the lake passing the
ARROW about half a mile away Then the young inventor saw that Andy
had two other lads in the boat with him

Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey I guess he murmured Well theyre
a trio pretty much alike The farther off they are the better I like
it

Tom once more gave his attention to his own boat He was going at a
fair speed but not the limit and he counted on reaching home in about
a half hour Suddenly when he was just congratulating himself on the
smoothrunning qualities of his motor which had not missed an
explosion the machinery stopped

Hello exclaimed the young inventor in some alarm Whats up now

He quickly shut off the gasoline and went back to the motor Now there
are so many things that may happen to a gasoline engine that it would
be difficult to name them all offhand and Tom who had not had very
much experience was at a loss to find what had stopped his machinery
He tried the spark and found that by touching the wire to the top of
the cylinder when the proper connection was made that he had a hot
fat one The compression seemed all right and the supply pipe from
the gasoline tank was in perfect order Still the motor would not go
No explosion resulted when he turned the flywheel over not even when
he primed the cylinder by putting a little gasoline in through the
cocks on the cylinder heads

Thats funny he remarked to himself as he rested from his labors and
contemplated the dead motor First time it has gone back on me
The boat was drifting down the lake and at the sound of another motor
craft approaching Tom looked up He saw the RED STREAK containing
Andy Foger and his cronies They had observed the young inventors
plight

Want a tow sneered Andy

Whatll you take for your secondhand boat that wont run asked Pete
Bailey

Better get out of the way or you might be run down added Sam
Snedecker

Tom was too angry and chagrined to reply and the RED STREAK swept on

Ill make her go if it takes all night declared Tom energetically
Once more he tried to start the motor It coughed and sighed as if in
protest but would not explode Then Tom cried The spark plug
Thats where the trouble is Ill wager Why didnt I think of it
before

It was the work of but a minute to unscrew the spark plugs from the
tops of the cylinders He found that both had such accumulations of
carbon on them that no spark could ever have reached the mixture of
gasoline and air

Ill put new ones in he decided for he carried a few spare plugs
for emergencies Inside of five minutes with the new plugs in place
the motor was running better than before

Now for home cried Tom and if I meet Andy Foger Ill race him
this time

But the RED STREAK was not in sight and a little later Tom had run
the ARROW into the boathouse locked the door and was on his way up to
the mansion

I suppose Mrs Baggert and Garret will be surprised to see me he
remarked Maybe theyll think we dont trust them by coming back in
this fashion to see that everything is safe But then I suppose dad
is naturally nervous about some of his valuable machinery and
inventions I think Ill find everything all right though

As Tom went up the main path and swung off to a side one which was a
short cut to the house he saw in the dusk for it was now early
evening a movement in the bushes that lined the walk

Hello Garret exclaimed the lad taking it for granted it was the
engineer employed by Mr Swift

There was no reply and Tom with a sudden suspicion sprang toward the
bushes The shrubbery was more violently agitated and as the lad
reached the screen of foliage he saw a man spring up from the ground
and take to his heels

Here Who are you What do you want yelled Tom

Hardly had he spoken when from behind a big apple tree another man
sprung It was light enough so that the lad could see his face and a
glimpse of it caused him to cry out

Happy Harry the tramp

Before he could call again the two men had disappeared




CHAPTER XIII

TOM IN DANGER


Garret Garret Jackson cried Tom as he struggled through the hedge
of bushes and ran after the men Where are you Garret Come on and
help me chase these men

But there came no answer to Toms hail He could not hear the sound of
the retreating footsteps of the men now and concluded that they had
made their escape Still he would not give up but dashed on slipping
and stumbling now and then colliding with a tree

What can they be doing here thought Tom in great anxiety Are they
after some more of dads inventions because they didnt get his turbine
motor

Hello Whos there Who are you called a voice suddenly

Oh Garret Where have you been asked the young inventor
recognizing the tones of his fathers keeper Ive been calling you
Some of those scoundrels are around again

Why if it isnt Tom ejaculated the engineer However in the world
did you get here I thought you were at Sandport

Ill explain later Garret Just now I want to catch those men if I
can

Which men

Happy Harry and another one I saw them hiding down by the orchard
path Come on theyre right ahead of us

But though they hunted as well as they were able to in the
fastgathering darkness there was no trace of the intruders They had
to give up and Tom after going to the boathouse to see that the ARROW
was all right returned to the house where he told the engineer and
housekeeper what had brought him back and how he had surprised the two
men

Is everything all right Garret he concluded Dad is nervous and
frightened I must telephone him at the hotel tonight and let him
know for I promised to come back I cant though until tomorrow

Everything is all right as far as I know answered Jackson Ive
kept a careful watch and the burglar alarm has been in working order
Mrs Baggert and I havent been disturbed a single night since you went
away Its curious that the men should be here the very night you come
back Maybe they followed you

I hardly think so for they didnt know I was coming

You cant tell what those fellows know commented the engineer
But anyhow I dont suppose they could have gotten here from Sandport
as soon as you did

Oh yes they could in their automobile declared Tom But I dont
believe they knew I was coming They knew we were away however and
thought it would be a good time to steal something I guess Are you
sure nothing has been taken

Perfectly sure but you and I will take a look around the shop

They made a hasty examination but found nothing disturbed and no signs
that anyone had tried to break in

I think Ill telephone dad that everything is all right decided Tom
It is as far as his inventions are concerned and if I tell about
seeing the men it will only worry him I can explain that part better
when I see him But when I go back Garret you will have to be on
your guard since those men are in the neighborhood

I will Tom Dont worry

Mr Swift was soon informed by his son over the telephone that nothing
in the shops had been disturbed and the inventor received the news
with evident satisfaction He requested Tom to come back to the hotel
in the morning in order that the three of them might go for a ride
about the lake in the afternoon and Tom decided to make an early start

The night passed without incident though Tom who kept the gun Mr
Duncan had given him in readiness for use got up several times
thinking he heard suspicious noises After an early breakfast and
having once more cautioned the engineer and housekeeper to be on their
guard Tom started back in the ARROW

As it would not be much out of his way the young inventor decided to
cut across the lake and stop at the sanitarium that he might inquire
about Mr Duncan He thought he could speed the ARROW up sufficiently
to make up for any time he might lose and with this in mind he
headed out toward the middle of Lake Carlopa The engine was working
splendidly with the new spark plugs and Tom was wondering if there was
any possible method of getting more revolutions out of the motor He
had about come to the conclusion that a new propeller might answer his
purpose when he heard the noise of an approaching boat He looked up
quickly and exclaimed

Andy Foger again and Pete and Sam are with him Its a wonder he
wouldnt go off on a trip instead of cruising around so near home
Guess hes afraid hell get stuck

Idly Tom watched the RED STREAK It was cutting through the water at a
fast rate throwing up curling foam on either side of the sharp bow
He seems to be heading this way mused Tom Well Im not going to
race with him today

Nearer and nearer came the speedy craft straight for the ARROW The
young inventor shifted his helm in order to get out of Andys course
but to his surprise he saw that the red haired lad changed the
direction of his own boat

Guess he wants to see how close he can come to me thought our hero
Maybe he wants to show how fast hes going

The RED STREAK was now so close that the features of the occupants
could easily be distinguished There were grins on the faces of Andy
and his cronies

Get out of the way or well run you down cried the bully Weve
got the right of way

Dont you try anything like that shouted Tom in some alarm not that
he was afraid of Andy but the RED STREAK was getting dangerously near
and he knew Andy was not a skillful helmsman The autoboat was now
headed directly at the ARROW and coming on speedily Andy was bending
over the wheel and Tom had begun to turn his in order to get well out
of the way of the insolent squinteyed lad and his friends

Suddenly Andy uttered a cry and leaped up

Look out Look out he yelled My steering gear has broken I
cant change my course Look out

The RED STREAK was bearing right down on Toms boat

Shut off your power Reverse shouted Tom

Andy seemed confused and did not know what to do Sam Snedecker sprang
to the side of his crony but he knew even less about a motorboat It
looked as if Tom would be run down and he was in great danger

But the young inventor did not lose his head He put his wheel hard
over and then leaping to his motor sent it full speed forward Not a
moment too soon had he acted for an instant later the other boat shot
past the stern of the ARROW hitting it a severe but glancing blow
Toms boat quivered from end to end and he quickly shut off the power
By this time Andy had succeeded in slowing down his craft The young
inventor hastily looked over the side of the ARROW One of the rudder
fastenings had been torn loose

What do you mean by running me down shouted Tom angrily

II didnt do it on purpose returned Andy contritely I was
seeing how near I could come to you when my steering gear broke I
hope I havent damaged you

My rudders broken went on Tom and Ive got to put back to repair
it I ought to have you arrested for this

Ill pay for the damage replied Andy and he was so frightened that
he was white in spite of his tan and freckles

That wont do me any good now retorted Tom It will delay me a
couple of hours If you try any tricks like that again Ill complain
to the authorities and you wont be allowed to run a boat on this lake

Andy knew that his rival was in the right and did not reply The bully
and his cronies busied themselves over the broken steering gear and
the young inventor finding that he could make a shift to get back to
his boathouse turned his craft around and headed for there in order
to repair the damage




CHAPTER XIV

THE ARROW DISAPPEARS


Paying no heed to the occupants of the bullys boat who by reason of
their daring had been responsible for his accident that might have
resulted seriously Tom was soon at his dock He had it conveniently
arranged for hoisting craft out of the water to repair them and in a
few minutes the stern of the ARROW was elevated so that he could get at
the rudder

Well its not as bad as I thought he remarked when with critical
eye he had noted the damage done I can fix it in about an hour if
Garret helps me

Going up to the house to get some tools and to tell the engineer that
he had returned Tom looked out over the lake and saw Andys boat
moving slowly off

Theyve got her fixed up in some kind of shape he murmured Its a
shame for a chump like Andy to have a good boat like that Hell spoil
it in one season Hes getting altogether too reckless First thing
he knows he and I will have a clash and Ill pay back some of the old
scores

Mr Jackson was much surprised to see the young inventor home again so
soon as was also Mrs Baggert Tom explained what had happened and
he and the engineer went to work repairing the damage done by the RED
STREAK As the owner of the ARROW had anticipated the work did not
take long and shortly before dinner time the boat was ready to
resume the interrupted trip to Sandport

Better stay and have lunch urged Mrs Baggert You can hardly get
to the hotel by night anyhow and maybe it would be better not to
start until tomorrow

No I must get back tonight or dad would be worried declared Tom
Ive been gone longer now than I calculated on But I will have
dinner here and if necessary I can do the last half of the trip
after dark I know the way now and I have a compass and a good
searchlight

The ARROW was let down into the water again and tied outside the
boathouse ready for a quick start The dinner Mrs Baggert provided
was so good that Tom lingered over it longer than he meant to and he
asked for a second apple dumpling with hard sauce on So it was with a
very comfortable feeling indeed and with an almost forgiving spirit
toward Andy Foger that our hero started down the path to the lake

Now for a quick run to Sandport he said aloud I hope I shant see
any more of those men and that dad hasnt been bothered by them His
suspicions about the house werent altogether unfounded for I did see
the tramp and some one else sneaking around but I dont believe
theyll come back now

Tom swung around the path that led to the dock As he came in sight of
the water he stared as if he could not believe what he saw or
rather what he did not see For there was no craft tied to the
stringpiece where he had fastened his motorboat He looked again
rubbed his eyes to make sure and then cried out

The ARROW is gone

There was no doubt of it The craft was not at the dock Breaking
into a run Tom hastened to the boathouse The ARROW was not in there
and a look across the lake showed only a few rowboats in sight

Thats mighty funny mused the youth I wonder

He paused suddenly in his thoughts

Maybe Garret took it out to try and see that it worked all right he
said hopefully He knows how to run a boat Maybe he wanted to see
how the rudder behaved and is out in it now He got through dinner
before I did But I should have thought hed have said something to me
if he was going out in it

This was the one weak point in Toms theory and he felt it at once

Ill see if Garret is in his shop he went on as he turned back
toward the house

The first person he met as he headed for the group of small structures
where Mr Swifts inventive work was carried on was Garret Jackson the
engineer

II thought you were out in my boat stammered Tom

Your boat Why would I be out in your boat and Mr Jackson removed
his pipe from his mouth and stared at the young inventor

Because its gone

Gone repeated the engineer and then Tom told him The two hurried
down to the dock but the addition of another pair of eyes was of no
assistance in locating the ARROW The trim little motor craft was
nowhere to be seen

I cant understand it said Tom helplessly I wasnt gone more than
an hour at dinner and yet

It doesnt take long to steal a motorboat commented the engineer

But I think I would have heard them start it went on the lad
Maybe it drifted off though Im sure I tied it securely

No theres not much likelihood of that Theres no wind today and
no currents in the lake But it could easily have been towed off by
some one in a rowboat and then you would not have heard the motor
start

Thats so agreed the youth Thats probably how they did it They
sneaked up here in a rowboat and towed the ARROW off Im sure of it

And Ill wager I know who did it exclaimed Mr Jackson energetically

Who demanded Tom quickly

Those men who were sneaking aroundHappy Harry and his gang They
stole the boat once and theyd do it again Those men took your boat
Tom

The young inventor shook his head

No he answered I dont believe they did

Why not

Well because they wouldnt dare come back here when they knew were
on the lookout for them It would be too risky

Oh those fellows dont care for risk was the opinion of Mr
Jackson Take my word for it they have your boat They have been
keeping watch and as soon as they saw the dock unprotected they
sneaked up and stole the ARROW

I dont think so repeated Mr Swifts son

Who do you think took it then

Andy Foger was the quick response I believe he and his cronies
did it to annoy me They have been trying to get even with meor at
least Andy hasfor outbidding him on this boat Hes tried several
times but he hasnt succeededuntil now Im sure Andy Foger has my
boat and Tom with a grim tightening of his lips swung around as
though to start in instant pursuit

Where are you going asked Mr Jackson

To find Andy and his cronies When I locate them Ill make them tell
me where my boat is

Hadnt you better send some word to your father You can hardly get
to Sandport now and hell be worried about you

Thats so I will Ill telephone dad that the boatno Ill not do
that either for hed only worry and maybe get sick Ill just tell
him Ive had a little accident that Andy ran into me and that I cant
come back to the hotel for a day or two Maybe Ill be lucky to find
my boat in that time But dad wont worry then and when I see him I
can explain Thats what Ill do and Tom was soon talking to Mr
Swift by telephone

The inventor was very sorry his son could not come back to rejoin him
and Ned but there was no help for it and with as cheerful voice as
he could assume the lad promised to start for Sandport at the earliest
opportunity

Now to find Andy and my boat Tom exclaimed as he hung up the
telephone receiver




CHAPTER XV

A DISMAYING STATEMENT


Trouble is sometimes good in a way it makes a person resourceful Tom
Swift had had his share of annoyances of late but they had served a
purpose He had learned to think clearly and quickly Now when he
found his boat stolen he at once began to map out a plan of action

What will you do first asked Mr Jackson as he saw his employers
son hesitating

First Im going to Andy Fogers house declared the young inventor
If hes home Im going to tell him what I think of him If hes not
Im going to find him

Why dont you take your sailboat and run down to his dock suggested
the engineer It isnt as quick as your motorboat but its better
than walking

So it is exclaimed the lad I will use my catboat I had
forgotten all about it of late Im glad you spoke

He was soon sailing down the lake in the direction of the boathouse on
the waterfront of Mr Fogers property It needed but a glance around
the dock to show him that the RED STREAK was not there but Tom
recollected the accident to the steering gear and thought perhaps Andy
had taken his boat to some wharf where there was a repair shop and
there left it to return home himself But inquiry of Mrs Foger who
was as nice a woman as her son was a mean lad gave Tom the information
that his enemy was not at home

He telephoned to me that his boat was damaged said Mrs Foger
gently and that he had taken it to get fixed Then he said he and
some friends were going on a little cruise and might not be back
tonight

Did he say where he was going asked our hero who did not tell
Andys mother why he wanted to see her son

No and Im worried about him Sometimes I think Andy is toowell
too impetuous and Im afraid he will get into trouble

Tom in spite of his trouble could hardly forbear smiling Andys
mother was totally unaware of the mean traits of her son and thought
him a very fine chap Tom was not going to undeceive her

Im afraid something will happen to him she went on Do you think
there is any danger being out on the lake in a motorboat Mr Swift
I understand you have one

Yes I have one answered Tom He was going to say he had once had
one but thought better of it No there is very little danger this
time of year he added

I am very glad to hear you say so went on Mrs Foger with a sigh
I shall feel more at ease when Andy is away now When he returns
home I shall tell him you called upon him and he will return your
visit I am glad to see that the custom of paying calls has not died
out among the present generation It is a pleasant habit and I am
glad to have my son conform to it He shall return your kind visit

Oh no its of no consequence replied Tom quickly thinking grimly
that his visit was far from a friendly one There is no need to tell
your son I was here I will probably see him in a day or two

Oh but I shall tell him insisted Mrs Foger with a kind smile
Im sure he will appreciate your call

There was much doubt concerning this in the mind of the young inventor
but he did not express it and soon took his leave Up and down the
lake for the rest of the day he cruised looking in vain for a sight of
Andy Foger in the RED STREAK but the racing boat appeared to be well
hidden

If I only could find where theyve taken mine mused Tom Hang it
all this is rotten luck and for the first time he began to feel
discouraged

Maybe youd better notify the police suggested Mr Jackson when Tom
returned to the Swift house that night They might help locate it

I think I can do as well as the police answered the youth If the
boat is anywhere its on the lake and the police have no craft in
which to make a search

Thats so agreed the engineer I wish I could help you but I
dont believe it would be wise for me to leave the house especially
since those men have been about lately

No you must stay here was Toms opinion Ill take another day or
two to search By this time Andy and his gang will return Im sure
and I can tackle them

Suppose they dont

Well then Ill make a tour of the lake in my sailboat and Ill run up
to Sandport and tell dad for he will wonder whats keeping me Ill
know better next time than to leave my boat at the dock without taking
out the connection at the spark coil so no one can start the motor I
should have done that at first but you always think of those things
afterward

The lad began his search again the next morning and cruised about in
little bays and gulfs looking for a sight of the RED STREAK or the
ARROW but he saw neither and a call at Andys house showed that the
redhaired youth had not returned Mrs Foger was quite nervous over
her sons continued absence but Mr Foger thought it was all right

Another day passed without any results and the young inventor was
getting so nervous partly with worrying over the loss of his boat and
partly on his fathers account that he did not know what to do

I cant stand it any longer he announced to Mrs Baggert the night
of the third day after a telephone message had been received from Mr
Swift The inventor wanted to know why his son did not return to the
hotel to join him and Ned Well what will you do asked the
housekeeper

If I dont find my boat tomorrow Ill sail to Sandport bring home
dad and Ned and we three will go all over the lake My boat must be on
it somewhere but Lake Carlopa is so cut up that it could easily be
hidden

Its queer that the Foger boy doesnt come home That makes it look
as if he was guilty

Oh Im sure he took it all right returned Tom All I want is to
see him It certainly is queer that he stays away as long as he does
Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey are with him too But theyll have to
return some time

Tom dreamed that night of finding his boat and that it was a wreck He
awoke glad to find that the latter part was not true but wishing that
some of his night vision might come to pass during the day

He started out right after breakfast and as usual headed for the
Foger home He almost disliked to ask Mrs Foger if her son had yet
returned for Andys mother was so polite and so anxious to know
whether any danger threatened that Tom hardly knew how to answer her
But he was saved that embarrassment on this occasion for as he was
going up the walk from the lake to the residence he met the gardener
and from him learned that Andy had not yet come back

But his mother had a message from him I did hear went on the man
Hes on his way It seems he had some trouble

Trouble What kind of trouble asked Tom

I dont rightly know sir but and here the gardener winked his eye
Master Andy isnt particular what kind of trouble he gets into

Thats right agreed our hero and as he went down again to where he
had left his boat he thought Nor what kind of trouble he gets other
people into I wish I had hold of him for about five minutes

The sailboat swung slowly from the dock and heeled over to the gentle
breeze Hardly knowing what to do Tom headed for the middle of the
lake He was discouraged and tired of making plans only to have them
fail

As he looked across the stretch of water he saw a boat coming toward
him He shaded his eyes with his hand to see better and then with a
pair of marine glasses took an observation He uttered an exclamation

Thats the RED STREAK as sure as Im alive he cried But whats
the matter with her Theyre rowing

The lad headed his boat toward the approaching one There was no doubt
about it It was Andy Fogers craft but it was not speeding forward
under the power of the motor Slowly and laborious the occupants were
pulling it along and as it was not meant to be rowed progress was
very slow

Theyve had a breakdown thought Tom Serves em right Now wait
till I tackle em and find out where my boat is Ive a good notion to
have Andy Foger arrested

The sailing craft swiftly approached the motorboat Tom could see the
three occupants looking at him apprehensively as well as curiously he
thought

Guess they didnt think Id keep after em mused the young inventor
and a little later he was beside the RED STREAK

Well cried Tom angrily its about time you came back

Weve had a breakdown remarked Andy and he seemed quite humiliated
He was beginning to find out that he didnt know as much about a
motorboat as he thought he did

Ive been waiting for you went on Tom

Waiting for us What for asked Sam Snedecker

What for As if you didnt know blurted out the owner of the ARROW
I want my boat Andy Foger the one you stole from me and hid Tell
me where it is at once or Ill have you arrested

Your boat repeated the bully and there was no mistaking the
surprise in his tones

Yes my boat Dont try to bluff me like that

Im not trying to bluff you Weve been away three days and just got
back

Yes I know you have You took my boat with you too

Are you crazy demanded Pete Bailey

No but you fellows must have been to think you could take my boat and
me not know it and Tom filled with wrath grasped the gunwale of the
RED STREAK as if he feared it would suddenly shoot away

Look here burst out Andy and he spoke sincerely we didnt touch
your boat Did we fellows

No exclaimed Sam and Pete at once and they were very much in
earnest

We didnt even know it was stolen did we went on Andy

No agreed his chums Tom looked unconvinced

We havent taken your boat and we can prove it continued the bully
I know you and I have had quarrels but Im telling you the truth Tom
Swift I never touched your boat

There was no mistaking the sincerity of Andy He was not a skilful
deceiver and Tom looking into his squinteyes which were opened
unusually wide could not but help believing the fellow

We havent seen it since the day we had the collision added Andy
and his chums confirmed this statement

We went off on a little cruise continued the redhaired bully and
broke down several times We had bad luck Just as we were nearing
home something went wrong with the engine again I never saw such a
poor motor But we never took your boat Tom Swift and we can prove
it

Tom was in despair He had been so sure that Andy was the thief that
to believe otherwise was difficult Yet he felt that he must He
looked at the disabled motor of the RED STREAK and viewed it with the
interested and expert eye of a machinist no matter if the owner of it
was his enemy Then suddenly a brilliant idea came into Toms head




CHAPTER XVI

STILL ON THE SEARCH


You seem to have lots of trouble with your boat Andy said Tom after
a few moments of rather embarrassed silence

I do admitted the owner of the RED STREAK Ive had bad luck ever
since I got it but usually Ive been able to fix it by looking in the
book This time I cant find out what the trouble is nor can any of
the fellows It stopped when we were out in the middle of the lake and
we had to row Im sick of motor boating

Suppose I fix it for you went on Tom

If you do Ill pay you well

I wouldnt do it for paynot the kind you mean continued the young
inventor

What do you mean then and Andys face that had lighted up became
glum again

Well if I fix your boat for you will you let me run it a little
while

You mean show me how to run it

No I mean take it myself Look here Andy my boats been stolen
and I thought you took it to get even with me You say you didnt

And I didnt touch it interposed the squinteyed lad quickly

All right I believe you But somebody stole it and I think I know
who

Who asked Sam Snedecker

Well you wouldnt know if I told you but I suspect some men with
whom I had trouble before and Tom referred to Happy Harry and his
gang I think they have my boat on this lake and Id like to get
another speedy craft to cruise about it and make a further search How
about it Andy If I fix your boat will you let me take it to look
for my boat

Sure thing agreed the bully quickly and his voice for once was
friendly toward Tom Fix the engine so it will run and you can use
the RED STREAK as long as you like

Oh I probably wouldnt want it very long I could cover the lake in
about three days and I hope by that time I could locate the thieves
Is it a bargain

Sure agreed Andy again and Tom got into the motorboat to look at
the engine He found that it would require some time to adjust it
properly and that it would be necessary to take the motor apart

I think Id better tow you to my dock the young inventor said to
Andy I can use some tools from the shop then and by tonight Ill
have the RED STREAK in running order

The breeze was in the right quarter fortunately and with the
motorboat dragging behind the ARROWs owner put the nose of the
sailing craft toward his home dock

When Tom reached his house he found that Mrs Baggert had received
another telephone message from Mr Swift inquiring why his son had not
returned to Sandport

He says if you dont come back by tomorrow repeated the
housekeeper that hell come home by train Hes getting anxious I
believe

Shouldnt wonder admitted Tom But I want him to stay there The
change will do him good Ill soon have my boat back now that I can
go about the lake swiftly and then Ill join him Ill tell him to be
patient

Tom talked with his father at some length assuring him that everything
was well at the Shopton house and promising to soon be with him Then
the young inventor began work on the motor of the RED STREAK He found
it quite a job and had to call on Mr Jackson to help him for one of
the pistons had to be repaired and a number of adjustments made to the
cylinders

But that night the motor was fully mended and placed back in the boat
It was in better shape than it had been since Andy had purchased the
craft

There remarked Tom now Im ready to hunt for those scoundrels
Will you leave your boat at my dock tonight Andy

Yes so you can start out early in the morning Im not going

Why not demanded Tom quickly

Welleryou see Ive had enough of motoring for a while explained
Andy Besides I dont believe my mother would like me to go out on a
chase after thieves If we had to shoot I might hit one of them and

Oh I see answered Tom But I dont like to take your boat alone
Besides I dont fancy there will be much shooting I know Im not
going to take a gun In fact the one Mr Duncan gave me is in the
boat All I want is to get the ARROW back

Thats all right went on Andy You take my boat and use it as long
as you like Ill rest up a few days When you find your boat you can
bring mine back

Tom understood He was just as glad not to have Andy accompany him in
the chase as he and the redhaired lad had never been good friends and
probably never would be So it would cause some embarrassment to be
together in a boat all day Then again Tom knew he could manage the
RED STREAK better alone but of course he did not want to mention
this when he asked for the loan of the craft Andys own suggestion
however had solved the difficulty Tom had an idea that Andy felt a
little timid about going in pursuit of the thieves but naturally it
would not do to mention this for the squinteyed lad considered
himself quite a fighter

Early the next morning alone in the RED STREAK Tom continued the
search for his stolen boat He started out from his home dock and
mapped out a course that would take him well around the lake

I spose I could take a run to Sandport now mused the youth as he
shot in and out of the little bays keeping watch for the ARROW But
if I do dad will have to be told all about it and hell worry Then
too he might want to accompany me and I think I can manage this
better alone for the RED STREAK will run faster with only one in I
ought to wind up this search in two days if my boat is still on the
lake And if those scoundrels have sunk her Ill make them pay for it

On shot the speedy motorboat in and out along the winding shoreline
with the lad in the bow at the steeringwheel peering with eager eyes
into every nook and corner where his craft might be hidden




CHAPTER XVII

THERE SHE IS


Anticipating that he would be some time on his search the young
inventor had gone prepared for it He had a supply of provisions and
he had told Mrs Baggert he might not be back that night But he did
not intend to sleep aboard the RED STREAK which being a racing boat
was not large enough to afford much room for passengers Tom had
planned therefore to put up at some hotel near the lake in case his
hunt should last beyond one night

That it would do this was almost certain for all that morning he
searched unavailingly for the ARROW A distant mill whistle sounding
over Lake Carlopa told him it was noon

Dinner time he announced to himself Guess Ill run up along shore
in the shade and eat

Selecting a place where the trees overhung the water forming a quiet
cool nook Tom sent the boat in there and tying it to a leaning tree
he began his simple meal Various thoughts filled his mind but chief
among them was the desire to overtake the thieves who had his boat
That it was Happy Harrys gang he was positive

The lad nearly finished eating and was considering what direction he
might best search in next when he heard running along a road that
bordered the lake an automobile

Wonder who that is mused Tom It wont do any harm to take a look
for it might be some of those thieves again They probably still have
their auto or Happy Harry couldnt have gotten from Sandport to Shopton
so quickly

The young inventor slipped ashore from the motorboat taking care to
make no noise Stealing silently along toward the road he peered
through the underbrush for a sight of the machine which seemed to be
going slowly But before the youth had a glimpse of it he was made
aware who the occupant was by hearing someone exclaim

Bless my shoe laces if this cantankerous contraption isnt going wrong
again I wonder if its going to have a fit here in this lonely place
It acts just as if it was Bless my very existence Hold on now Be
nice Be nice

Mr Damon exclaimed Tom and without knowing it he had spoken
aloud

Hold on there Hold on Whos calling me in this forsaken locality
Bless my shirt studs But who is it and the eccentric man who had
sold Tom the motorcycle looked intently at the bushes

Here I am Mr Damon answered the lad stepping out into the road
I knew it was you as soon as I saw you

Bless my liver but thats very true I suppose you heard my
unfortunate automobile puffing along I declare I dont know what ails
it I got it on the advice of my physician who said I must get out in
the air but bless my gears its the auto who needs a doctor more
than I do Its continually out of order Something is going to
happen right away I can tell by the way its behaving

Mr Damon had thrown out the clutch but the engine was still running
though in a jerky uncertain fashion which indicated to the trained
ear of the young inventor that something was wrong

Perhaps I can fix it for you as I did before ventured Tom

Bless my eyebrows Perhaps you can cried the eccentric man
hopefully You always seem to turn up at the right moment How do
you manage it

I dont know I remember the time you turned up just when I wanted
you to help me capture Happy Harry and his gang and now by a strange
coincidence Im after them again

You dont say so My good gracious Bless my hatband But thats
odd There he ejaculated suddenly as the automobile engine stopped
with a choking sigh I knew something was going to happen

Let me take a look proposed the lad and he was soon busy peering
into the interior of the machine At first he could not find the
trouble but being a persistent youth Tom went at it systematically
and located it in two places The clutch was not rightly adjusted and
the carburetor float feed needed fixing The young inventor was not
long in making the slight repairs and then he assured Mr Damon that
his automobile would run properly

Bless my very existence but what a thing it is to have a head for
mechanics exclaimed the odd man gratefully Now it would bother me
to adjust a nutmeg grater if it got out of order but I dare say you
could fix it in no time

Yes answered Tom I could and so could you for theres nothing
about it to fix But you can go ahead now if you wish

Thank you It just shows how ignorant I am of machinery I presume
something will go wrong in another mile or two But may I ask what you
are doing here I presume you are in your motorboat sailing about
for pleasure And didnt I understand you to say you were after those
chaps again Bless my watch charm but I was so interested in my
machine that I didnt think to ask you

Yes I am after those thieves again

In your motorboat I presume Well I hope you catch them What
have they stolen now

My motorboat Thats why Im after them but I had to borrow a craft
to chase them with

Bless my soul You dont tell me How did it happen

Thereupon the lad related as much of the story as was necessary to put
Mr Damon in possession of the facts and he ended up with

I dont suppose you have seen anything of the men in my boat have
you

Mr Damon seemed strangely excited He had entered his auto but as
the lads story progressed the odd gentleman had descended When Tom
finished he exclaimed

Dont say a word nownot a word I want to think and that is a
process which for me requires a little time Dont speak a word
now Bless my left hand but I think I can help you

He frowned stamped first one foot then the other looked up at the
sky as if seeking inspiration there and then down at the ground as
if that would help him to think Then he clapped his hands smartly
together and cried out

Bless my shoe buttons

Have you seen them asked Tom eagerly

Was your boat one with a red arrow painted on the bow asked Mr
Damon in turn

It was and the lad was now almost as excited as was his friend

Then Ive seen it and whats more this morning Bless my spark
plug Ive seen it

Tell me about it pleaded the young inventor and Mr Damon calming
himself after an effort resumed

I was out for an early spin in my auto he said and was traveling
along a road that bordered the lake about fifteen miles above here I
heard a motorboat puffing along near shore and looking through the
trees I saw one containing three men It had a red arrow on the bow
and thats why I noticed it because I recalled that your boat was
named the DART

ARROW corrected Tom

The ARROW Oh yes I knew it was something like that Well of
course at the time I didnt think that it was your boat but I
associated it in my mind with yours Do you catch my meaning

Tom did and said so wishing Mr Damon would hurry and get to the
point But the eccentric character had to do things in his own way

Exactly he resumed Well I didnt think that was your boat but
at the same time I watched the men out of curiosity and I was struck
with their behavior They seemed to be quarreling and from what I
could hear two of them seemed to be remonstrating with the third one
for having taken some sort of a piece of wood from the forward
compartment I believe that is the proper term

Yes Tom almost shouted But where did they go What became of
them What was the man doing to the forward compartmentwhere the
gasoline tank is

Exactly I was trying to think what was kept there Thats it the
gasoline tank Well the boat kept on up the lake and I dont know
what became of the men But about that piece of wood It seems that
one of the men removed a block from under the tank and the others
objected Thats why they were quarreling

Thats very strange exclaimed the lad There must be some mystery
about my boat that I dont understand But that will keep until I get
the boat itself Goodby Mr Damon I must be off

Where to

Up the lake after those thieves I must lose no time and Tom
started to go back to where he had left the RED STREAK

Hold on cried Mr Damon I have something to propose Tom Two
heads are better than one even if one doesnt know how to adjust a
nutmeg grate Suppose I come along with you I can point out the
direction the men took at any rate

Ill be very glad to have you answered the lad who felt that he
might need help if there were three of the thieves in his craft But
what will you do with your automobile

Ill just run it down the road a way to where a friend of mine has a
stable Ill leave it in there and join you Will you let me come
Bless my eye glasses but Id like to help catch those scoundrels

Ill be very glad to have you Go ahead put the auto in the barn and
Ill wait for you

I have a better plan than that replied Mr Damon Run your boat
down to that point and he indicated one about a mile up the lake
Ill be there waiting for you and well lose no time I can cover
the ground faster in my auto than you can in your boat

Tom saw the advantage of this and was soon under way while he heard on
shore the puffing of his friends car On the trip to the point Tom
puzzled over the strange actions of the man in taking one of the braces
from under the gasoline tank

Ill wager he did it before thought the lad It must be the same
person who was tampering with the lock of the forward compartment the
day I bought the boat But whythats the questionwhy

He could find no answer to this puzzle over it as he did and he gave
it up His whole desire now was to get on the trail of the thieves
and he had strong hopes after the clew Mr Damon had given him The
latter was waiting for him on the point and so nimble was the owner of
the auto in spite of his size that Tom was not delayed more than the
fraction of a minute ere he was under way again speeding up the lake

Now keep well in toward shore advised Mr Damon Those fellows
dont want to be observed any more than they can help and theyll
sneak along the bank They were headed in that direction and he
pointed it out Now I hope you wont think Im in the way Besides
you know if you get your boat back youll want some one to help steer
it while you run this one I can do that at all events bless my
very existence

I am very glad of your help replied the lad but he did not take his
eyes from the water before him and he was looking for a sight of his
boat with the men in it

For three hours or more Tom and Mr Damon cruised in and out along the
shore of the lake going farther and farther up the body of water Tom
was beginning to think that he would reach Sandport without catching
sight of the thieves and he was wondering if after all he might not
better stop off and see his father when above the puffing of the motor
in the RED STREAK he heard the putput of another boat

Listen cried Mr Damon who had heard it at the same time

Tom nodded

Theyre just ahead of us whispered his companion

If its them was the lads reply

Speed up and well soon see suggested Mr Damon and Tom shoved the
timer over The RED STREAK forged ahead The sound of the other boat
came more plainly now It was beyond a little point of land The
young inventor steered out to get around it and leaned eagerly forward
to catch the first glimpse of the unseen craft Would it prove to be
the ARROW

The putput became louder now Mr Damon was standing up as if that
would in some mysterious way help Then suddenly the other boat came
into view Tom saw it in an instant and knew it for the ARROW

There she is he cried




CHAPTER XVIII

THE PURSUIT


For an instant after Toms exultant cry the men in the boat ahead were
not aware that they were being pursued Then as the explosions from
the motor of the RED STREAK sounded over the water they turned to see
who was coming up behind them There was no mistaking the attitude of
the young inventor and his companion They were leaning eagerly
forward as if they could reach out and grasp the criminals who were
fleeing before them

Put on all the speed you can Tom begged Mr Damon Well catch
the scoundrels now Speed up the motor Oh if I only had my
automobile now Bless my crank shaft but one can go so much faster on
land than on water

The lad did not reply but thought with grim humor that running an
automobile over Lake Carlopa would be no small feat Mr Damon
however knew what he was saying

Well catch them Well nab em he cried Speed her up Tom

The youth was doing his best with the motor of the RED STREAK He was
not as well acquainted with it as he was with the one in his boat but
he knew even better than Andy Foger how to make it do efficient work
It was a foregone conclusion that the RED STREAK if rightly handled
could beat the ARROW but there were several points in favor of the
thieves The motor of Toms boat was in perfect order and even an
amateur with some knowledge of a boat could make it do nearly its
best On the other hand the RED STREAKs machinery needed nursing
Again the thieves had a good start and that counted for much But
Tom counted on two other points One was that Happy Harry and his gang
would probably know little about the fine points of a motor They had
shown this in letting the motor of the boat they had first stolen get
out of order and Tom knew the ins and outs of a gasoline engine to
perfection So the chase was not so hopeless as it seemed

Do you think you can catch them asked Mr Damon anxiously

Im going to make a big try answered his companion

Theyre heading out into the middle of the lake cried the eccentric
man

If they do I can cut them off murmured Tom as he put the wheel over

But whoever was steering the ARROW knew better than to send it on a
course that would enable the pursuing boat to cut across and shorten
the distance to it After sending the stolen craft far enough out from
shore to clear points of land that jutted out into the lake the
leading boat was sent straight ahead

A stern chase and a long chase murmured Mr Damon Bless my
rudder but those fellows are not going to give up easily

I guess not murmured Tom Will you steer for a while Mr Damon

Of course I will If I could get out and pull the boat after me to
make it go faster I would But as I always lose my breath when I run
perhaps its just as well that I stay in here Tom thought so too
but his attention was soon given to the engine He adjusted the timer
to get if possible a little more speed out of the boat he had borrowed
from Andy and he paid particular attention to the oiling system

Were going a bit faster called Mr Damon encouragingly or else
theyre slacking up

Tom peered ahead to see if this was so It was hard to judge whether
he was overhauling the ARROW as it was a stern chase and that is
always difficult to judge But a glimpse along shore showed him that
they were slipping through the water at a faster speed

Theyre up to something suddenly exclaimed Mr Damon a moment later
I believe theyre going to fire on us Tom They are pointing
something this way

The lad stood up and gazed earnestly at his boat which seemed to be
slipping away from him so fast One of the occupants was in the stern
aiming some glittering object at those in the RED STREAK For a moment
Tom thought it might be a gun Then as the man turned he saw what it
was

A pair of marine glasses cried the lad Theyre trying to make out
who we are

I guess they know well enough rejoined Mr Damon Cant you go any
faster Tom

Im afraid not But well land them sooner or later They cant go
very far in this direction without running ashore and well have them
Theyre cutting across the lake now

They may escape us if it gets dark Probably thats what theyre
working for They want to keep ahead of us until nightfall

The young inventor thought of this too but there was little he could
do The motor was running at top speed It could be made to go
faster Tom knew with another ignition system but that was out of the
question now

The man with the glasses had resumed his seat and the efforts of the
trio seemed concentrated on the motor of the ARROW They too wished
to go faster But they had not skill enough to accomplish it and in
about ten minutes when Tom took another long and careful look to
ascertain if possible whether or not he was overhauling the thieves he
was delighted to see that the distance between the boats had lessened

Were catching them Were creeping up on them cried Mr Damon
Keep it up Tom There was nothing to do however save wait The
boat ahead had shifted her course somewhat and was now turning in
toward the shore for the lake was narrow at this point and abandoning
their evident intention of keeping straight up the lake the thieves
seemed now bent on something else

I believe theyre going to run ashore and get out cried Mr Damon

If they do its just what I want declared the lad I dont care
for the men I want my boat back

The occupants of the ARROW were looking to the rear again and
oneHappy Harry Tom thoughtshook his fist

Ah wait until I get hold of you cried Mr Damon following his
example Ill make you wish youd behaved yourselves you scoundrels
Bless my overcoat Catch them if you can Tom

There was now no doubt of the intention of the fleeing ones The shore
was looming up ahead and straight for it was headed the ARROW Tom
sent Andys boat in the same direction He was rapidly overhauling the
escaping ones now for they had slowed down the motor Three minutes
later the foremost boat grated on the beach of the lake The men
leaped out one of them pausing an instant in the bow

Here dont you damage my boat cried Tom involuntarily for the man
seemed to be hammering something

The fellow leaped over the side holding something in his hand

There they go Catch them yelled Mr Damon

Let them go answered the lad as the men ran toward the wood I
want my boat Im afraid theyve damaged her One of them tore
something from the bow

At the same instant the two companions of the fellow who had paused in
the forward part of the ARROW saw that he had something in his hand
With yells of rage they dashed at him but he shaking his fist at
them plunged into the bushes and could be heard breaking his way
through while his companions were in pursuit

Theyve quarreled among themselves commented Mr Damon as high and
angry voices could be heard from the woods Theres some mystery
here Tom

I dont doubt it but my first concern is for my boat I want to see
if they have damaged her

Tom had run so closely in shore with the RED STREAK that he had to
reverse to avoid damaging the craft against the bank In a mass of
foam he stopped her in time and then springing ashore he hurried to
his motorboat




CHAPTER XIX

A QUIET CRUISE


Have they done any damage asked Mr Damon as he stood in the bow of
the RED STREAK

Tom did not answer for a moment His trained eye was looking over the
engine

They yanked out the high tension wire instead of stopping the motor
with the switch he answered at length and then when he had taken a
look into the compartment where the gasoline tank was he added And
theyve ripped out two more of the braces I put in Why in the world
they did that I cant imagine

Thats evidently what one man had that the others wanted was Mr
Damons opinion

Probably agreed Tom But what could he or they want with wooden
braces

That was a puzzler for Mr Damon but he answered

Perhaps they wanted to damage your boat and those two men were mad
because the other got ahead of them

Taking out the braces wouldnt do much damage I can easily put
others in All it would do would be to cause the tank to sag down and
maybe cause a leak in the pipe But that would be a queer thing to do
No I think theres some mystery that I havent gotten to the bottom of
yet But Im going to

Good exclaimed Mr Damon Ill help you But can you run your
boat back home

Not without fixing it a bit I must brace up that tank and put in a
new hightension wire from the spark coil I can do it here but Id
rather take it to the shop Besides with two boats to run back for I
must return Andys to him I dont see how I can do it very well unless
you operate one Mr Damon

Excuse me but I cant do it Bless my slippers but I would be sure
to run on a rock The best plan will be for you to tow your boat and
Ill ride in it and steer I can do that much anyhow You can ride
in the RED STREAK

Tom agreed that this would be a good plan So after temporarily
bracing up the tank in the ARROW it was shoved out into the lake and
attached to Andys craft

But arent you going to make a search for those men asked Mr Damon
when Tom was ready to start back

No I think it would be useless They are well away by this time and
I dont fancy chasing them through the woods especially as night is
coming on Besides I wont leave these boats

No doubt you are right but I would like to see them punished and I
am curious enough to wish to know what object that scoundrel could have
in ripping out the blocks that served as a brace for the tank

I feel the same way myself commented the lad especially since this
is the second time thats happened But well have to wait I guess

A little later the start back was made Mr Damon steering the ARROW
skillfully enough so that it did not drag on the leading boat in which
Tom rode His course took him not far from the lake sanitarium where
Mr Duncan the hunter had been brought and desiring to know how the
wounded man was getting on the youth proposed that they make a halt
explaining to Mr Damon his reason

Yes and while youre about it youd better telephone your father that
you will join him tomorrow suggested the other I know what it is
to fret and worry You can fix your boat up in time to go to Sandport
tomorrow cant you

Yes Im glad you reminded me of it Ill telephone from the
sanitarium if theyll let me

Mr Duncan was not at the institution Tom was told his injury having
healed sufficiently to allow of his being removed to his home The
youth readily secured permission to use the telephone and was soon in
communication with Mr Swift While not telling him all the
occurrences that had delayed him Tom gave his father and Ned Newton
enough information to explain his absence Then the trip to Shopton
was resumed in the two boats

What are you going to do about your automobile asked Tom as they
neared the point where the machine had been left

Never mind about that replied Mr Damon It will do it good to
have a nights vacation I will go on to your house with you and
perhaps I can get a train back to my friends home so that I can claim
my car

Wont you stay all night with me invited the young inventor Id
be glad to have you

Mr Damon agreed and Tom putting more speed on the RED STREAK was
soon opposite his own dock The ARROW was run in the boathouse and the
owner hastily told Mrs Baggert and the engineer what had occurred
Then he took Andys boat to Mr Fogers dock and warmly thanked the
redhaired lad for the use of his craft

Did you find your boat asked Andy eagerly How did the RED STREAK
run

I got my boat and yours runs fine explained Tom

Good Ill race you again some day declared Andy

Mr Damon enjoyed his visit at our heros house for Mrs Baggert
cooked one of her best suppers for him Tom and the engineer spent the
evening repairing the motorboat Mr Damon looking on and exclaiming
Bless my shoe leather or some other part of his dress or anatomy at
every stage of the work The engineer wanted to know all about the men
and their doings but he could supply no reason for their queer actions
regarding the braces under the gasoline tank

In the morning Tom once more prepared for an early start for Sandport
and Mr Damon reconsidering his plans rode as far with him as the
place where the automobile had been left There he took leave of the
young inventor promising to call on Mr Swift in the near future

I hope you arrive at the hotel where your father is without any more
accidents remarked the automobilist Bless my very existence but
you seem to have the most remarkable series of adventures I ever heard
of

They are rather odd admitted Tom I dont know that I particularly
care for them either But now that I have my boat back I guess
everything will be all right

But Tom could not look ahead He was destined to have still more
exciting times as presently will be related

Without further incident he arrived at the Lakeview Hotel in Sandport
that evening and found his father and Ned very glad to see him Of
course he had to explain everything then and with his son safely in
his sight Mr Swift was not so nervous over the recital as he would
have been had Tom not been present

Now for some nice quiet trips remarked the lad when he had finished
his account I feel as if I had cheated you out of part of your
vacation Ned staying away as long as I did

Well of course we missed you answered his chum But your father
and I had a good time

Yes and I invented a new attachment for a kitchen boiler added Mr
Swift I had a chance for it when I passed through the hotel kitchen
one day for I wanted to see what kind of a range they used

I guess theres no stopping you from inventing replied his son with
a laugh and a hopeless shake of the head But dont let it happen
again when you go away to rest

Oh I only just thought of it said Mr Swift I havent worked the
details out yet

Then he wanted to know about everything at home and he seemed
particularly anxious lest the Happy Harry gang do some damage

I dont believe they will Tom assured him Garret and Mrs Baggert
will be on guard

The next few days were pleasant ones for Tom his father and Ned
Newton They cruised about the lake went fishing and camped in the
woods Even Mr Swift spent one night in the tent and said he liked it
very much For a week the three led an ideal existence going about as
they pleased Ned taking a number of photographs with his new camera
The ARROW proved herself a fine boat and Tom and Ned when Mr Swift
did not accompany them explored the seldom visited parts of Lake
Carlopa

The three had been out one day and were discussing the necessity of
returning home soon when Ned spoke

I shall hate to give up this life and go to slaving in the bank
again he complained I wish I was an inventor

Oh we inventors dont have such an easy time said Mr Swift You
never know when trouble is coming and he little imagined how near the
truth he was

A little later they were at the hotel dock When Tom had tied up his
boat the three walked up the path to the broad veranda that faced the
lake A boy in uniform met them

Some one has just called you on the telephone Mr Swift he reported

Some one wants me Who is it

I think he said his name is Jackson sir Garret Jackson and he says
the message is very important

Tom something has happened at home exclaimed the inventor as he
hurried up the steps Im afraid theres bad news

Unable to still the fear in his heart Tom followed his father




CHAPTER XX

NEWS OF A ROBBERY


With a hand that trembled so he could scarcely hold the receiver of the
telephone Mr Swift placed it to his ear

Hello Hello he cried into the transmitter Yes this is Mr
Swiftyes Garret What is it

Then came a series of clicks which Tom and Ned listened to The
inventor spoke again

Whats that The same men Broke in early this evening Oh thats
too bad Of course Ill come at once

There followed more meaningless clicks which Tom wished he could
translate His father hung up the receiver turned to him and
exclaimed

Ive been robbed again

Robbed again How dad

By that same rascally gang Garret thinks This evening when he and
Mrs Baggert were in the house the burglar alarm went off The
indicator showed that the electrical shop had been entered and the
engineer hurried there He saw a light inside and the shadows of
persons on the windows Before he could reach the shop however the
thieves heard him coming and escaped Oh Tom I should never have
come away

But did they take anything dad Perhaps Garret frightened them away
before they had a chance to steal any of your things Did you ask him
that

I didnt need to He said he made a hasty exanimation before he
called me up and he is sure a number of my electrical inventions are
missing Some of them are devices I never have had patented and if I
lose them I will have no recovery

But just what ones are they Perhaps we can send out a police alarm
tonight

Garret couldnt tell that answered Mr Swift as he paced to and fro
in the hotel office He doesnt know all the tools and machinery I
had in there But it is certain that some of my most valuable things
have been taken

Never mind Dont worry dad and Tom tried to speak soothingly for
he saw that his father was much excited We may be able to get them
back How does Garret know the same men who stole the turbine model
broke in the shop this evening

He saw them One was Happy Harry he is positive The others he did
not know but he recognized the tramp from our description of him

Then we must tell the police at once

Yes Tom I wish you would telephone Ill give you a description of
the things No I cant do that either for I dont know what was
stolen I must go home at once to find out Its a good thing the
motorboat is here Come lets start at once What is my bill here
and the inventor turned to the hotel proprietor who had come into the
office I have suffered a severe loss and must leave at once

I am very sorry sir Ill have it ready for you in a few minutes

All right Tom is your boat ready for a quick trip

Yes dad but I dont like to make it at night with three in Of
course it might be perfectly safe but theres a risk and I dont like
to take it

Dont worry about the risk on my account Tom Im not afraid I
must get home and see of what I have been robbed

The young inventor was in a quandary He wanted to do as his father
requested and to aid him all he could yet he knew that an allnight
trip in the boat down the lake would be dangerous not only from the
chance of running on an unknown shore or into a hidden rock but
because Mr Swift was not physically fitted to stand the journey

Come Tom exclaimed the aged inventor impatiently we must start at
once

Wont morning do as well dad

No I must start now I could not sleep worrying over what has
happened We will start

At that instant there came a low rumbling peal of thunder Mr Swift
started and peered from a window There came a flash of lightning and
another vibrant report from the stormcharged clouds

There is your bill Mr Swift remarked the proprietor coming up
but I would not advise you to start tonight There is a bad storm in
the west and it will reach here in a few minutes Storms on Lake
Carlopa especially at this open and exposed end are not to be
despised I assure you

But I must get home insisted Toms father

The lace curtain over the window blew almost straight out with a sudden
breeze and a flash of lightning so bright that it reflected even in
the room where the incandescent electrics were glowing made several
others jump Then came a mighty crash and with that the floodgates
of the storm were opened and the rain came down in torrents Tom
actually breathed a sigh of relief The problem was solved for him
It would be impossible to start tonight and he was glad of it much
as he wanted to get on the trail of the thieves

There was a scurrying on the part of the hotel attendants to close the
windows and the guests who had been enjoying the air out on the
porches came running in With a rush a roar and a muttering as peal
after peal of thunder sounded the deluge continued

Its a good thing we didnt start observed Ned

I should say so agreed Tom But well get off the first thing in
the morning dad

Mr Swift did not reply but his nervous pacing to and fro in the hotel
office showed how anxious he was to be at home again There was no
help for it however and after a time finding that to think of
reaching his house that night was out of the question the inventor
calmed down somewhat

The storm continued nearly all night as Tom could bear witness for he
did not sleep well nor did his father And when he came down to
breakfast in the morning Mr Swift plainly showed the effects of the
bad news His face was haggard and drawn and his eyes smarted and
burned from lack of sleep

Well Tom we must start early he said nervously I am glad it has
cleared off Is the boat all ready

Yes and its a good thing it was under shelter last night or wed
have to bail it out now and that would delay us

An hour later they were under way having telephoned to the engineer at
the Swift home that they were coming Garret Jackson reported over the
wire that he had notified the Shopton police of the robbery but that
little could be done until the inventor arrived to give a description
of the stolen articles

And that will do little good I fear remarked Tom Those fellows
have evidently been planning this for some time and will cover their
tracks well Id like to catch them not only to recover your things
dad but to find out the mystery of my boat and why the man took the
tank braces




CHAPTER XXI

THE BALLOON ON FIRE


Down Lake Carlopa speeded the ARROW those on board watching the banks
slip past as the motorboat rapidly cut through the water

What time do you think we ought to reach home Tom asked Mr Swift

Oh about four oclock if we dont stop for lunch

Then well not stop decided the inventor Well eat what we have
on board I suppose you have some rations and he smiled the first
time since hearing the bad news

Oh yes Ned and I didnt eat everything on our camping trips and
Tom was glad to note that the fine weather which followed the storm was
having a good effect on his father

We certainly had a good time remarked Ned I dont know when Ive
enjoyed a vacation so

Its too bad it had to be cut short by this robbery commented Mr
Swift

Oh well my time would be up in a few days more went on the young
bank employee Its just as well to start back now

Tom took the shortest route he knew keeping in as close to shore as he
dared for now he was as anxious to get home as was his father On and
on speeded the ARROW yet fast as it was it seemed slow to Mr Swift
who like all nervous persons always wanted to go wherever he desired
to go instantly

Tom headed his boat around a little point of land and was urging the
engine to the top notch of speed for now he was on a clear course
with no danger from shoals or hidden rocks when he saw darting out
from shore a tiny craft which somehow seemed familiar to him He
recognized a peculiar putputter of the motor

Thats the DOT he remarked in a low voice to Ned Miss Nestors
cousins boat

Is she in it now asked Ned

Yes answered Tom quickly

Youve got good eyesight remarked Ned dryly to tell a girl at that
distance It looks to me like a boy

No its MaryI mean Miss Nestor the youth quickly corrected
himself and a close observer would have noticed that he blushed a bit
under his coat of tan

Ned laughed Tom blushed still more and Mr Swift who was in a stern
seat glanced up quickly

It looks as if that boat wanted to hail us the inventor remarked

Tom was thinking the same thing for though he had changed his course
slightly since sighting the DOT the little craft was put over so as to
meet him Wondering what Miss Nestor could want but being only too
willing to have a chat with her the young inventor shifted his helm
In a short time the two craft were within hailing distance

How do you do called Miss Nestor as she slowed down her motor
Dont you think Im improving Mr Swift

Whats that IerI beg your pardon but I didnt catch that
exclaimed the aged inventor quickly coming out of a sort of daydream
I beg your pardon He thought she had addressed him

Miss Nestor blushed and looked questioningly at Tom

My father he explained as he introduced his parent Ned needed
none having met Miss Nestor before Indeed you have improved very
much went on our hero You seem able to manage the boat all alone

Yes Im doing pretty well Dick lets me take the DOT whenever I want
to and I thought Id come out for a little trial run this morning
Im getting ready for the races I suppose you are going to enter
them and she steered her boat alongside Toms who throttled down his
powerful motor so as not to pass his friend

Races I hadnt heard of them he replied

Oh indeed there are to be fine ones under the auspices of the Lanton
Motor Club Mr Hastings of whom you bought that boat is going to
enter his new CARLOPA and Dick has entered the DOT in the baby class
of course But Im going to run it and thats why Im practicing

I hope you win remarked Tom I hadnt heard of the races but I
think Ill enter Im glad you told me Do you want to race now and
he laughed as he looked into the brown eyes of Mary Nestor

No indeed unless you give me a start of several miles

They kept together for some little time longer and then as Tom knew
his father would be restless at the slow speed he told Miss Nestor the
need of haste and advancing his timer he soon left the DOT behind
The girl called a laughing goodby and urged him not to forget the
races which were to take place in about two weeks

I suppose Andy Foger will enter his boat commented Ned

Naturally agreed Tom Its a racer and hell probably think it
can beat anything on the lake But if he doesnt manage his motor
differently it wont

The distance from Sandport to Shopton had been more than half covered
at noon when the travelers ate a lunch in the boat Mr Swift was
looking anxiously ahead to catch the first glimpse of his dock and Tom
was adjusting the machinery as finely as he dared to get out of it the
maximum speed

Ned Newton who happened to be gazing aloft wondering at the perfect
beauty of the blue sky after the storm uttered a sudden exclamation
Then he arose and pointed at some object in the air

Look he cried A balloon It must have gone up from some fair

Tom and his father looked upward High in the air almost over their
heads was an immense balloon It was of the hotair variety such as
performers use in which to make ascensions from fair grounds and
circuses and below it dangled a trapeze upon which could be observed
a man only he looked more like a doll than a human being

I shouldnt like to be as high as that remarked Ned

I would answered Tom as he slowed down the engine the better to
watch the balloon Id like to go up in an airship and I intend to
some day

I believe hes going to jump suddenly exclaimed Ned after a few
minutes Hes going to do something anyhow

Probably come down in a parachute said Tom They generally do
that

No No cried Ned He isnt going to jump Something has
happened The balloon is on fire Hell be burned to death

Horror stricken they all gazed aloft From the mouth of the balloon
there shot a tongue of fire and it was followed by a cloud of black
smoke The big bag was getting smaller and seemed to be descending
while the man on the trapeze was hanging downward by his hands to get
as far as possible away from the terrible heat




CHAPTER XXII

THE RESCUE


Jump Jump cried Mr Swift leaping to his feet and motioning to
the man on the trapeze of the balloon But it is doubtful whether or
not the performer heard him Certainly he could not see the frantic
motions of the inventor Why doesnt he jump Mr Swift went on
piteously to the two lads Hell surely be burned to death if he
hangs on there

Its too far to leap exclaimed Tom Hes a good way up in the air
though it looks like only a short distance He would be killed if he
dropped now

He ought to have a parachute added Ned Most of those men do when
they go up in a balloon Why doesnt he come down in that I wonder
how the balloon took fire

Maybe he hasnt a parachute suggested Tom while he slowed down the
motorboat still more so as to remain very nearly under the blazing
balloon

Yes he has cried Ned See its hanging to one side of the big
bag He ought to cut loose He could save himself then Why doesnt
he

The balloon was slowly twisting about gradually settling to the
surface of the lake but all the while the flames were becoming fiercer
and the black clouds of smoke increased in size

There see the parachute went on Ned

The twisting of the bag had brought into view the parachute or big
umbrellashaped bag which would have enabled the man to safely drop to
the surface of the lake Without it he would have hit the water with
such force that he would have been killed as surely as if he had struck
the solid earth But the boys and Mr Swift also saw something else
and this was that the balloon was on fire on the same side where the
parachute was suspended

Look Look shouted Tom bringing his boat to a stop Thats why he
cant jump He cant reach the parachute

By this time the balloon had settled so low that the actions of the man
could be plainly seen That he was in great agony of fear as well as
in great pain from the terrific heat over his head was evident He
shifted about on the trapeze bar now hanging by one hand so as to
bring his body a little farther below the blazing end of the bag then
when one arm tired he would hang by the other If the balloon would
only come down more quickly it would get to within such a short
distance of the water that the man could safely make the drop But the
immense canvas bag was settling so slowly for it was still very
buoyant that considerable time must elapse before it would be near
enough to the water to make it safe for the unfortunate man to let go
the trapeze

Oh if we could only do something cried Tom We have to remain
here helpless and watch him burn to death Its awful

The three in the boat continued to gaze upward They could see the man
making frantic efforts to reach his parachute from time to time Once
as a little current of air blew the flames and smoke to one side he
thought he had a chance Up on the trapeze bar he pulled himself and
then edged along it in an endeavor to grasp the ring of the parachute
Once he almost had hold of that and also the cord which ran to a knife
blade This cord being pulled would sever the rope that bound it to
the balloon and he would be comparatively safe so he might drop to
the lake But just as he was about to grasp the ring and cord the
smoke came swirling down on him and the hungry flames seemed to put out
their fiery tongues to devour him He had to slide back and once more
hung by his hands

I thought he was saved then whispered Tom and even the whisper
sounded loud in the silence

Several men came running along the shore of the lake now They saw the
occupants in the ARROW and cried out

Why dont you save him Go to his rescue

What can we do asked Ned quietly of his two friends but he did not
trouble to answer the men on shore who probably did not know what they
were saying

The motorboat had drifted from a spot under the unfortunate
balloonist and at a word from his father the young inventor started
the engine and steered the craft back directly under the blazing bag
again

If he does drop perhaps we may be able to pick him up said Mr
Swift I wish we could save him

A cry from Ned startled Tom and his father and their eyes that had
momentarily been directed away from the burning bag high in the air
were again turned toward it

The balloon is falling apart exclaimed Ned Its all up with him
now

Indeed it did seem so for pieces of the burning canvas blazing and
smoking were falling in a shower from the part of the bag already
consumed and the fiery particles were fairly raining down on the man
But he still had his wits about him though his perilous position was
enough to make any one lose his mind and he swung from side to side on
the bar shifting skillfully with his hands and dodging the larger
particles of blazing canvas When some small sparks fell on his
clothing he beat them out with one hand while with the other he clung
to the trapeze

There was scarcely any wind or the mans plight might have been more
bearable for the current of air would have carried the smoke and fire
to one side As it was most of the smoke and flames went straight up
save now and then when a draught created by the heat would swirl the
black clouds down on the performer hiding him from sight for a second
or two A breeze would have carried the sparks away instead of letting
them fall on him

Nearer and nearer to the surface of the lake sank the balloon By this
time the crowd on the bank had increased and there were excited
opinions as to what was best to do But the trouble was that little
could be done If the man could hold out until he got near enough to
the water to let go he might yet be saved but this would not be for
some time at the present rate the balloon was falling The performer
realized this and as the fire was getting hotter he made another
desperate attempt to reach the parachute It was unavailing and he had
to drop back hanging below the slender bar

Suddenly there came a puff of wind fanning the faces of those in the
motorboat and they looked intently to observe if there was any
current as high as was the balloonist They saw the big bag sway to
one side and the flames broke out more fiercely as they caught the
draught The balloon moved slowly down the lake

Keep after it Tom urged his father We may be able to save him

The lad increased the speed of his engine and Ned who was at the
wheel gave it a little twist Then with a suddenness that was
startling the blazing canvas airship began to settle swiftly toward
the water It had lost much of its buoyancy

Now he can jump Hes near enough to the water now cried Tom

But a new danger arose True the balloon was rapidly approaching the
surface of the lake and in a few seconds more would be within such a
short distance that a leap would not be fatal But the burning bag was
coming straight down and scarcely would the man be in the water ere the
fiery canvas mass would be on top of him

In such an event he would either be burned to death or so held down
that drowning must quickly follow

If there was only wind enough to carry the balloon beyond him after he
jumped he could do it safely cried Ned

Tom said nothing He was measuring with his eye the distance the
balloon had yet to go and also the distance away the motorboat was
from where it would probably land

He can do it exclaimed the young inventor

How asked his father

For answer Tom caught up a newspaper he had purchased at the hotel that
morning Rolling it quickly into a cone so that it formed a rough
megaphone he put the smaller end to his mouth and pointing the
larger opening at the balloonist he called out

Drop into the lake Well pick you up before the bag falls on you
Jump Let go now

The balloonist heard and understood So did Ned and Mr Swift Toms
quick wit had found a way to save the man

Faster and faster the blazing bag settled toward the surface of the
water It was now merely a mushroomshaped piece of burning and
smoking canvas yet it was supporting the man almost as a parachute
would have done

With one look upward to the burning mass above him and a glance
downward to the lake the aeronaut let go his hold Like a shot he
came down holding his body rigid and straight as a stick for he knew
how to fall into water did that balloonist

Tom Swift was ready for him No sooner had the lad called his
directions through the megaphone than the young inventor had speeded up
his engine to the top notch

Steer so as to pick him up Tom cried to Ned who was at the wheel
Pass by him on a curve and as soon as I grab him put the wheel over
so as to get out from under the balloon

It was a risky thing to do but our hero had it all planned out He
made a loop of the boats painter and hurrying to the bow leaned
over as far as he could holding the rope in readiness His idea was
to have the balloonist grab the strands and be pulled out of danger by
the speedy motorboat for the blazing canvas would cover such an
extent of water that the man could not have swum out of the danger zone
in time

Down shot the balloonist and down more slowly settled the collapsed
bag yet not so slowly that there was any time to spare It needed
only a few seconds to drop over the performer to burn and smother him

Into the water splashed the man disappearing from sight as when a
stick is dropped in point first Ned was alert and steered the boat
to the side in which the mans face was for he concluded that the
aeronaut would strike out in that direction when he came up The ARROW
was now directly under the blazing balloon and cries of fear from the
watchers on shore urged upon Tom and his companions the danger of their
position But they had to take some risk to rescue the man

There he is cried Mr Swift who was on the watch leaning over the
side of the boat Tom and Ned saw him at the same instant Ned
shifted his wheel and the young inventor bent over holding out the
rope for the man to grasp He saw it and struck out toward the ARROW
But there was no need for him to go far An instant more and the
speeding motorboat shot past him He grabbed the rope and Tom aided
by Mr Swift began to lift him out of the water

Quick To one side Ned yelled Tom for the heat of the descending
mass of burning canvas struck him like a furnace blast

Ned needed no urging With a swirl of the screw the ARROW shot herself
out of the way carrying the aeronaut with her A moment later the
burning balloon or what there was left of it settled down into the
lake hissing angrily as the fire was quenched by the water and
completely covering the spot where but a few seconds before the man
had been swimming He had been saved in the nick of time




CHAPTER XXIII

PLANS FOR AN AIRSHIP


Slow her down Ned cried Tom for the ARROW was shooting so swiftly
through the water that the young inventor found it impossible to pull
up the balloonist Ned hurried back to the motor and when the boats
way had been checked it was an easy matter to pull the dripping and
almost exhausted man into the craft

Are you much hurt asked Mr Swift anxiously for Tom was too much
out of breath with his exertion to ask any questions For that matter
the man was in almost as bad a plight He was breathing heavily as
one who had run a long race

II guess Im all right he panted Only burned a little on my
hands Thatthat was a close call

The boat swung around and headed for shore on which was quite a throng
of persons Some of them had cheered when they saw the plucky rescue

Im afraid we cant save your balloon gasped Tom as he looked at the
place where the canvas was still floating and burning

No matter It wasnt worth much Thats the last time Ill ever go
up in a hotair balloon said the man with more energy than he had
before exhibited Im done with em Ive had my lesson Hereafter
an aeroplane or a gas balloon for me I only did this to oblige the
fair committee Ill not do it again

The man spoke in short crisp sentences as though he was in too much
of a hurry to waste his words

Let it sink he went on Its no good Glad to see the last of it

Almost as he spoke with a final hiss and a cloud of steam that mingled
with the black smoke the remains of the big bag sunk beneath the
surface of the lake

We must get you ashore at once and to a doctor said Mr Swift You
must be badly burned

Not much Only my hands where some burning pieces of canvas fell on
em If I had a little oil to put on Id be all right

I can fix you up better than that put in Tom I have some
Vaseline

Good Just the thing Pass it over and the man though he spoke
shortly seemed grateful for the offer My names Sharp he went on
John Sharp of no place in particular for I travel all over Im a
professional balloonist Ha Thats the stuff

This last was in reference to a bottle of Vaseline which Tom produced
Mr Sharp spread some over the backs of his hands and went on

Thats better Much obliged I cant begin to thank you for what you
did for mesaved my life I thought it was all up with mewould have
been but for you Mustnt mind my mannerits a way I havehave to
talk quick when youre ballooninno timebut Im grateful all the
same Who might you people be

Tom told him their names and Mr Swift asked the aeronaut if he was
sure he didnt need the services of a physician

No doctor for me answered the balloonist Ive been in lots of
tight places but this was the worst squeeze If youll put me ashore
I guess I can manage now

But youre all wet objected Tom Where will you go You need some
other clothes for the man wore a suit of tights and spangles

Oh Im used to this went on the performer I frequently have to
fall in the water I always carry a little money with me so as to get
back to the place where I started from By the way where am I

Opposite Daleton answered Tom Where did you go up from

Pratonia Big fair there I was one of the features

Then youre about fifteen miles away commented Mr Swift You can
hardly get back before night Must you go there

Left my clothes there Also a valuable gas balloon No more hotair
ones for me Guess Id better go back and the aeronaut continued to
speak in his quick jerky sentences

Wed be very glad to have you come with us Mr Sharp went on the
inventor We are not far from Shopton and if you would like to
remain over night Im sure we would make you comfortable You can
proceed to Pratonia in the morning

Thanks Might not be a bad idea said Mr Sharp Im obliged to
you Ive got to go there to collect my money though I suppose they
wont give it all to me

Why not demanded Ned

Didnt drop from my parachute Couldnt Fire was one
reasoncouldnt reach the parachute and if I could have guess it
wouldnt have been safe Parachute probably was burned too But Im
done with hotair balloons though I guess I said that before

The boys were much interested in the somewhat odd performer and on
his part he seemed to take quite a notion to Tom who told him of
several things that he had invented Well remarked Mr Swift after a
while during which the boat had been moving slowly down the lake if
we are not to go ashore for a doctor for you Mr Sharp suppose we put
on more speed and get to my home Im anxious about a robbery that
occurred there and he related some facts in the case

Speed her up exclaimed Mr Sharp Wish I could help you catch the
scoundrels but afraid I canthands too sore and he looked at his
burns Then he told how he had made the ascension from the Pratonia
fair grounds and how when he was high in the air he had discovered
that the balloon was on fire He described his sensations and told how
he thought his time had surely come Sparks from the hot air used to
inflate it probably caused the blaze he said

Ive made a number of trips he concluded hot air and gas bags but
this was the worst ever It got on my nerves for a few minutes he
added coolly

I should think it would agreed Tom as he speeded up the motor and
sent the ARROW on her homeward way

The boys and Mr Swift were much interested in the experiences of the
balloonist and asked him many questions which he answered modestly
Several hours passed and late that afternoon the party approached
Shopton

Here we are exclaimed Mr Swift relief in his tones Now to see
of what I have been robbed and to get the police after the scoundrels

When the boat was nearing the dock Mr Sharp who had been silent for
some time suddenly turned to Tom and asked

Ever invent an airship

No replied the lad somewhat surprised I never did

I have went on the balloonist That is Ive invented part of it
Im stuck over some details Maybe you and Ill finish it some day
How about it

Maybe assented Tom who was occupied just then in making a good
landing I am interested in airships but I never thought I could
build one

Easiest thing in the world went on Mr Sharp as if it was an
everyday matter You and I will get busy as soon as we clear up this
robbery He talked as though he had been a friend of the family for
some time for he had a genial taking manner

A little later Mr Swift was excitedly questioning Garret Jackson
concerning the robbery and making an examination of the electrical shop
to discover what was missing

Theyve taken some parts of my gyroscope he exclaimed and some
valuable tools and papers as well as some unfinished work that will be
difficult to replace

Much of a loss asked Mr Sharp with a businesslike air

Well not so large as regards money answered the inventor but they
took things I can never replace and I will miss them very much if I
cannot get them back

Then well get them back snapped the balloonist as if that was all
there was to it

The police were called up on the telephone and the facts given to them
as well as a description of the stolen things They promised to do
what they could but in the light of past experiences Tom and his
father did not think this would be much There was little more that
could be done that evening Ned Newton went to his home and after
Mr Swift had insisted in calling in his physician to look after Mr
Sharps burns the balloonist was given a room next to Toms Then the
Swift household settled down

Well remarked Tom to his father as he got ready for bed this sure
has been an exciting day

And my loss is a serious one added the inventor somewhat sadly

Dont worry dad begged his son Ill do my best to recover those
things for you

Several days passed but there was no clew to the thieves That they
were the same ones who had stolen the turbine model there was little
doubt but they seemed to have covered their tracks well The police
were at a loss and though Tom and Mr Sharp cruised about the lake
they could get no trace of the men The balloonist had sent to
Pratonia for his clothing and other baggage and was now installed in
the Swift home where he was invited to stay a week or two

One night when he was looking over some papers he had taken from his
trunk the balloonist came over to where Tom was making a drawing of a
new machine he was planning and said

Like to see my idea for an airship Different from some Its a
dirigible balloon with an aeroplane front and rear to steer and balance
it in big winds It would be a winner only for one thing Maybe you
can help me

Maybe I can agreed Tom who was at once interested

We ought to be able to do something Look at our namesSwift and
Sharpquick and penetratinga good firm to build airships and he
laughed genially Shall we do it

Im willing agreed Tom and the balloonist spread his plans out on
the table he and the young inventor soon being deep in a discussion of
them




CHAPTER XXIV

THE MYSTERY SOLVED


From then on for several days the young inventor and his new friend
lived in an atmosphere of airships They talked them from morning
until night and even Mr Swift much as he was exercised over his
loss took part in the discussions

In the meanwhile efforts had not ceased to locate the robbers and
recover the stolen goods but so far without success

One afternoon about two weeks after the thrilling rescue of John
Sharp Tom said to the balloonist

Wouldnt you like to come for a ride in the motorboat Maybe it will
help us to solve the puzzle of the airship Well take a trip across
and up the opposite shore

Good idea commented Mr Sharp Fine day for a sail Come on
Blow the cobwebs from our brains

Mr Swift declined an invitation to accompany them as he said he would
stay home and try to straighten out his affairs which were somewhat
muddled by the robbery

Out over the blue waters of Lake Carlopa shot the ARROW It was making
only moderate speed as Tom was in no hurry and he knew his engine
would last longer if not forced too frequently They glided along
crossed the lake and were proceeding up the opposite shore when as
they turned out from a little bay and rounded a point of land Mr
Sharp exclaimed

Look out Tom theres rowboat just ahead

Oh Ill pass well to one side of that answered the young inventor
looking at the craft As he did so noting that there were four men in
it one of the occupants caught a glimpse of the ARROW No sooner had
he done so than he spoke to his companions and they all turned to
stare at Tom At first the lad could scarcely believe his eyes but as
he looked more intently he uttered a cry

There they are

Who inquired Mr Sharp

Those menthe thieves We must catch them

Tom had spoken loudly but even though the men in the rowboat did hear
what he said they would have realized without that that they were
about to be pursued for there was no mistaking the attitude of our
hero

Two of the thieves were at the oars and with one accord they at once
increased their speed The boat swung about sharply and was headed for
the shore which they seemed to have come from only a short time
previous as the craft was not far out in the lake

No you dont cried Tom I see your game You want to get to the
woods where youll have a better chance to escape If this isnt
great luck coming upon them this way

It was the work of but a moment to speed up the engine and head the
ARROW for the rowboat The men were pulling frantically but they had
no chance

Get between them and the shore cried Mr Sharp You can head them
off then This was good advice and Tom followed it The men among
whom the lad could recognize Happy Harry and Anson Morse were all
excited Two of them stood up as though to jump overboard but their
companions called to them to stop

If we only had a gun now not to shoot at them but to intimidate
them murmured the balloonist maybe theyd stop

Heres one answered Tom pointing to the seat locker where he kept
the shotgun Mr Duncan had given him In a moment Mr Sharp had it out

Surrender he cried pointing the weapon at the men in the small boat

Dont shoot Dont fire on us Well give up cried Happy Harry
and the two with the oars ceased pulling

Dont take any chances urged Mr Sharp in a low voice Keep
between them and the shore Ill cover them Tom was steering from
an auxiliary side wheel near the motor and soon the ARROW had cut off
the retreat of the men They could not land and to row across the lake
meant speedy capture

Well what do you want of us growled Morse What right have you
got to interfere with us in this fashion

The best of right answered Tom Youll find out when youre landed
in jail

You cant arrest us sneered Happy Harry Youre not an officer and
you havent any warrant

Tom hadnt thought of that and his chagrin showed in his face Happy
Harry was quick to see it

Youd better let us go he threatened We can have you arrested for
bothering us You havent any right to stop us Tom Swift

Maybe he hasnt but I have exclaimed John Sharp suddenly

You Who are you demanded Featherton alias Simpson the man who
had run the automobile that carried Tom away

Me Im a special deputy sheriff for this county answered the
balloonist simply Heres my badge and throwing back his coat he
displayed it You see I got the appointment in order to have some
authority in the crowds that gather to watch me go up he explained to
Tom who plainly showed his astonishment I found it very useful to
be able to threaten arrest but in this case Ill do more than
threaten You are my prisoners he went on to the men in the boat
and he handled the shotgun as if he knew how to use it Ill take you
into custody on complaint of Mr Swift for robbery Now will you go
quietly or are you going to make a fuss and Mr Sharp shut his jaw
grimly

Well seeing as how you have the drop on us I guess well have to do
as you say admitted Happy Harry alias Jim Burke But you cant
prove anything against us We havent any of Mr Swifts property

Well you know where it is then retorted Tom quickly

Under the restraining influence of the gun the men made no resistance
While Mr Sharp covered them Tom towed their boat toward shore Then
while the young inventor held the gun the balloonist tied the hands
and feet of the thieves in a most scientific manner for what he did
not know about ropes and knots was not worth putting into a book

Now I guess theyll stay quiet for a while remarked Mr Sharp as he
surveyed the crestfallen criminals Ill remain on guard here Tom
while you go notify the nearest constable and well take them to jail
We bagged the whole lot as neatly as could be desired

No you didnt get all of us exclaimed Happy Harry and there was a
savage anger in his tones

Keep quiet urged Morse

No Ill not keep quiet Its a shame that we have to take our
medicine while that trimmer Tod Boreck goes free He ought to have
been with us and he would be only hes trying to get away with that
sparkler

Keep quiet again urged Morse

Tom was all attention He had caught the word sparkler and he at
once associated it with the occasion he had heard the men use it
before He felt that he was on the track of solving the mystery
connected with his boat

He looked at the men They were the same four who had been involved in
the former theftAppleson Featherton Morse and Burke Were there
five of them He recalled the man who had been caught tampering with
his boatthe man who had tried to bid on the ARROW at the auction
Where was he

Boreck didnt get what he was after resumed Happy Harry and Im
going to spoil his game for him Say kid he went on to Tom look
in the front part of your boatwhere the gasoline tank is

Tom felt his heart beating fast At last he felt that he would solve
the puzzle He opened the forward compartment To his disappointment
it seemed as usual Morse and the others were making a vain effort to
silence Happy Harry

I dont see anything here said Tom

No because its hidden in one of those blocks of wood you use for a
brace continued the man Which one it is Boreck didnt know so he
pulled out two or three only to be fooled each time You must have
shifted them kid from the way they were when we had the boat

I did answered the young inventor recollecting how he had taken out
some of the braces and inserted new ones then painted the interior of
the compartment What is in the braces anyhow

The sparklera big diamondin a hollow place in the wood kid
exclaimed Happy Harry blurting out the words Im not going to let
Tod Boreck get away with it while we stay in jail

Take out all the braces that havent been moved and have a look
suggested Mr Sharp Tom only had to remove two those farthest back
for all the others had at one time or another been changed or taken
away by the thief

One of the blocks did not seem to have anything unusual about it but
at the sight of the other Tom could not repress a cry It was the one
that seemed to have had a hole bored in it and then plugged up again
He remembered his father noticing it on the occasion of overhauling the
boat

The sparklers in there said the tramp as he saw the brace Boreck
was after it several times but he never pulled out the right one

With his knife Tom dug out the putty that covered the round hole in the
block No sooner had he done so than there rolled out into his hand a
white object It was something done up in tissue paper and as he
removed the wrapper there was a flash in the sunlight and a large
beautiful diamond was revealed The mystery had been solved




CHAPTER XXV

WINNING A RACE


Where did this diamond come from demanded Mr Sharp of the quartette
of criminals

Thats for us to know and you to find out sneered Happy Harry I
dont care as long as that trimmer Boreck didnt get it He tried to
do us out of our share

Well I guess the police will make you tell went on the balloonist
Go for the constable Tom

Leaving his friend to guard the ugly men who for a time at least were
beyond the possibility of doing harm Tom hurried off through the woods
to the nearest village There he found an officer and the gang was
soon lodged in jail The diamond was turned over to the authorities
who said they would soon locate the owner

Nor were they long in doing it for it appeared the gem was part of a
large jewel robbery that had taken place some time before in a distant
city The Happy Harry gang as the men came to be called were
implicated in it though they got only a small share of the plunder
Search was made for Tod Boreck and he was captured about a week after
his companions Seeing that their game was up the men made a partial
confession telling where Mr Swifts goods had been secreted and the
inventors valuable tools papers and machinery were recovered no
damage having been done to them

It developed that after the diamond theft and when the gang still had
possession of Mr Hastings boat Boreck sometimes called Murdock by
his cronies unknown to them had secreted the jewel in one of the
braces under the gasoline tank He expected to get it out secretly
but the capture of the gang and the sale of the boat prevented this
Then he tried to buy the craft to take out the diamond but Tom overbid
him It was Boreck who found Andys bunch of keys and used one to open
the compartment lock when Tom surprised him The man did manage to
remove some of the blocks thinking he had the one with the diamond in
it but the fact of Tom changing them and painting the compartment
deceived him The gang hoped to get some valuables from Mr Swifts
shops and to a certain extent succeeded after hanging around for
several nights and following him to Sandport but Tom eventually proved
too much for them Even stealing the Arrow which was taken to aid the
gang in robbing Mr Swift did not succeed and Borecks plan then to
get possession of the diamond fell through

It was thought that the gang would get long terms in prison but one
night during a violent storm they escaped from the local jail and
that was the last seen of them for some time

A few days after the capture as Tom was in the boathouse making some
minor repairs to the motor he heard a voice calling

Mistah Swift am yo about

Hello Rad is that you he inquired recognizing the voice of the
colored owner of the mule Boomerang

Yais sa dats me I got a lettah fo yo I were passin de
postoffice an de clerk asted me to brung it to yo case as how its
marked hurry an he said he hadnt seen yo today

Thats right Ive been so busy I havent had time to go for the
mail and Tom took the letter giving Eradicate ten cents for his
trouble

Ha thats good exclaimed Tom as he read it

Hab some one done gone an left yo a fortune Mistah Swift asked
the negro

No but its almost as good Its an invitation to take part in the
motorboat races next week Id forgotten all about them I must get
ready

Good land Dats all de risin generation tinks about now observed
Eradicate racin an goin fast Mah ole mule Boomerang am good
enough fo me and shaking his head in a woeful manner Eradicate
went on his way

Tom told Mr Sharp and his father of the proposed races of the Lanton
Motorboat Club and as it was required that two persons be in a craft
the size of the ARROW the young inventor arranged for the balloonist
to accompany him Our hero spent the next few days in tuning up his
motor and in getting the ARROW ready for the contest

The races took place on that side of Lake Carlopa near where Mr
Hastings lived and he was one of the officials of the club There
were several classes graded according to the horsepower of the motors
and Tom found himself in a class with Andy Foger

Heres where I beat you boasted the redhaired youth exultantly
though his manner toward Tom was more temperate than usual Andy had
learned a lesson

Well if you can beat me Ill give you credit for it answered Tom

The first race was for highpowered craft and in this Mr Hastings
new CARLOPA won Then came the trial of the small boats and Tom was
pleased to note that Miss Nestor was on hand in the tiny DOT

Good luck he called to her as he was adjusting his timer for his
turn would come soon Remember what I told you about the spark for
he had given her a few lessons

If I win it will be due to you she called brightly

She did win coming in ahead of several confident lads who had better
boats But Miss Nestor handled the DOT to perfection and crossed the
line a boats length ahead of her nearest competitor

Fine cried Tom and then came the warning gun that told him to get
ready for his trial

This was a fivemile race and had several entrants The affair was a
handicap one and Tom had no reason to complain of the rating allowed
him

Crack went the starting pistol and away went Tom and one or two
others who had the same allowance as did he A little later the others
started and finally the last class including Andy Foger The RED
STREAK shot ahead and was soon in the lead for Andy and Sam had
learned better how to handle their craft Tom and Mr Sharp were
worried but they stuck grimly to the race and when the turning stake
was reached Toms motor had so warmed up and was running so well that
he crept up on Andy A mile from the final mark Andy and Tom were on
even terms and though the redhaired lad tried to shake off his rival
he could not Andys ignition system failed him several times and he
changed from batteries to magneto and back again in the hope of getting
a little more speed out of the motor

But it was not to be A halfmile away from the finish Tom who had
fallen behind a little crept up on even terms Then he slowly forged
ahead and a hundred rods from the stake the young inventor knew that
the race was his He clinched it a few minutes later crossing the
line amid a burst of cheers The ARROW had beaten several boats out of
her own class and Tom was very proud and happy

My but we certainly did scoot along some cried Mr Sharp But
thats nothing to how well go when we build our airship eh Tom and
he looked at the flushed face of the lad

No indeed agreed the young inventor But I dont know that well
take part in any races in it Well build it however as soon as we
can solve that one difficulty

They did solve it as will be told in the next book of this series to
be called Tom Swift and His Airship or The Stirring Cruise of the
RED CLOUD They had some remarkable adventures in the wonderful
craft and solved the mystery of a great bank robbery

This ended the contests of the motorboats and the little fleet crowded
up to the floats and docks where the prizes were to be awarded Tom
received a handsome silver cup and Miss Nestor a gold bracelet

Now I want all the contestants winners and losers to come up to my
house and have lunch invited Mr Hastings

As Tom and the balloonist strolled up the walk to the handsome house
Andy Foger passed them

You wouldnt have beaten me if my spark coil hadnt gone back on me
he said somewhat sneeringly

Maybe admitted Tom and just then he caught sight of Mary Nestor
May I take you in to lunch he asked

Yes she said because you helped me to win and she blushed
prettily And then they all sat down to the tables set out on the
lawn while Tom looked so often at Mary Nestor that Mr Sharp said
afterward it was a wonder he found time to eat But Tom didnt care
He was happy
