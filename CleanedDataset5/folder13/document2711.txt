A PHYLLIS OF THE SIERRAS


By Bret Harte




CHAPTER I


Where the great highway of the Sierras nears the summit and the pines
begin to show sterile reaches of rock and waste in their drawnup files
there are signs of occasional departures from the main road as if the
weary traveller had at times succumbed to the long ascent and turned
aside for rest and breath again The tired eyes of many a dusty
passenger on the old overland coach have gazed wistfully on those sylvan
openings and imagined recesses of primeval shade and virgin wilderness
in their dim perspectives Had he descended however and followed one
of these diverging paths he would have come upon some rude wagon track
or logslide leading from a clearing on the slope or the ominous
sawmill half hidden in the forest it was slowly decimating The
woodland hush might have been broken by the sound of water passing over
some unseen dam in the hollow or the hiss of escaping steam and throb
of an invisible engine in the covert

Such at least was the experience of a young fellow of fiveandtwenty
who knapsack on back and stick in hand had turned aside from the
highway and entered the woods one pleasant afternoon in July But he
was evidently a deliberate pedestrian and not a recent deposit of
the proceeding stagecoach and although his stout walkingshoes were
covered with dust he had neither the habitual slouch and slovenliness
of the tramp nor the hurried fatigue and growing negligence of an
involuntary wayfarer His clothes which were strong and serviceable
were better fitted for their present usage than the ordinary garments
of the Californian travellers which were too apt to be either above or
below their requirements But perhaps the strangers greatest claim to
originality was the absence of any weapon in his equipment He carried
neither rifle nor gun in his hand and his narrow leathern belt was
empty of either knife or revolver

A halfmile from the main road which seemed to him to have dropped out
of sight the moment he had left it he came upon a halfcleared area
where the hastilycut stumps of pines of irregular height bore an odd
resemblance to the broken columns of some vast and ruined temple A few
fallen shafts denuded of their bark and tessellated branches sawn into
symmetrical cylinders lay beside the stumps and lent themselves to the
illusion But the freshlycut chips so damp that they still clung in
layers to each other as they had fallen from the axe and the stumps
themselves still wet and viscous from their drained lifeblood were
redolent of an odor of youth and freshness

The young man seated himself on one of the logs and deeply inhaled the
sharp balsamic fragrancealbeit with a slight cough and a later hurried
respiration This and a certain drawn look about his upper lip
seemed to indicate in spite of his strength and color some pulmonary
weakness He however rose after a moments rest with undiminished
energy and cheerfulness readjusted his knapsack and began to lightly
pick his way across the fallen timber A few paces on the muffled whir
of machinery became more audible with the lazy monotonous command
of Gee thar from some unseen oxdriver Presently the slow
deliberatelyswaying heads of a team of oxen emerged from the bushes
followed by the clanking chain of the skids of sawn planks which they
were ponderously dragging with that ostentatious submissiveness peculiar
to their species They had nearly passed him when there was a sudden
hitch in the procession From where he stood he could see that a
projecting plank had struck a pile of chips and become partly imbedded
in it To run to the obstruction and with a few dexterous strokes and
the leverage of his stout stick dislodge the plank was the work not
only of the moment but of an evidently energetic hand The teamster
looked back and merely nodded his appreciation and with a Gee up Out
of that now the skids moved on

Much obliged there said a hearty voice as if supplementing the
teamsters imperfect acknowledgment

The stranger looked up The voice came from the open sashless
shutterless window of a rude buildinga mere shell of boards and beams
half hidden in the still leafy covert before him He had completely
overlooked it in his approach even as he had ignored the nearer
throbbing of the machinery which was so violent as to impart a decided
tremor to the slight edifice and to shake the speaker so strongly that
he was obliged while speaking to steady himself by the sashless frame
of the window at which he stood He had a face of goodnatured and alert
intelligence a masters independence and authority of manner in spite
of his blue jean overalls and flannel shirt

Dont mention it said the stranger smiling with equal but more
deliberate goodhumor Then seeing that his interlocutor still
lingered a hospitable moment in spite of his quick eyes and the jarring
impatience of the machinery he added hesitatingly I fancy Ive
wandered off the track a bit Do you know a Mr Bradleysomewhere
here

The strangers hesitation seemed to be more from some habitual
conscientiousness of statement than awkwardness The man in the window
replied Im Bradley

Ah Thank you Ive a letter for yousomewhere Here it is He
produced a note from his breastpocket Bradley stooped to a sitting
posture in the window Pitch it up It was thrown and caught cleverly
Bradley opened it read it hastily smiled and nodded glanced behind
him as if to implore further delay from the impatient machinery leaned
perilously from the window and said

Look here Do you see that silverfir straight ahead

Yes

A little to the left theres a trail Follow it and skirt along the
edge of the canyon until you see my house Ask for my wifethats Mrs
Bradleyand give her your letter Stop He drew a carpenters pencil
from his pocket scrawled two or three words across the open sheet
and tossed it back to the stranger See you at tea Excuse meMr
Mainwaringwere shorthandedandthe engine But here he
disappeared suddenly

Without glancing at the note again the stranger quietly replaced it
in his pocket and struck out across the fallen trunks towards the
silverfir He quickly found the trail indicated by Bradley although it
was faint and apparently worn by a single pair of feet as a shorter and
private cut from some more travelled path It was well for the stranger
that he had a keen eye or he would have lost it it was equally
fortunate that he had a mountaineering instinct for a sudden profound
deepening of the blue mist seen dimly through the leaves before him
caused him to slacken his steps The trail bent abruptly to the right
a gulf fully two thousand feet deep was at his feet It was the Great
Canyon

At the first glance it seemed so narrow that a rifleshot could have
crossed its tranquil depths but a second look at the comparative size
of the trees on the opposite mountain convinced him of his error A
nearer survey of the abyss also showed him that instead of its walls
being perpendicular they were made of successive ledges or terraces to
the valley below Yet the air was so still and the outlines so clearly
cut that they might have been only the reflections of the mountains
around him cast upon the placid mirror of a lake The spectacle arrested
him as it arrested all men by some occult power beyond the mere
attraction of beauty or magnitude even the teamster never passed
it without the tribute of a stone or broken twig tossed into its
immeasurable profundity

Reluctantly leaving the spot the stranger turned with the trail that
now began to skirt its edge This was no easy matter as the undergrowth
was very thick and the foliage dense to the perilous brink of the
precipice He walked on however wondering why Bradley had chosen so
circuitous and dangerous a route to his house which naturally would
be some distance back from the canyon At the end of ten minutes
struggling through the brush the trail became vague and to all
appearances ended Had he arrived The thicket was as dense as before
through the interstices of leaf and spray he could see the blue void of
the canyon at his side and he even fancied that the foliage ahead of
him was more symmetrical and less irregular and was touched here and
there with faint bits of color To complete his utter mystification
a womans voice very fresh very youthful and by no means unmusical
rose apparently from the circumambient air He looked hurriedly to the
right and left and even hopelessly into the trees above him

Yes said the voice as if renewing a suspended conversation it
was too funny for anything There were the two Missouri girls from
Skinners with their auburn hair ringleted my dear like the old
Books of Beautyin white frocks and sashes of an unripe greenish
yellow that puckered up your mouth like persimmons One of them was
speechless from good behavior and the otherwell the other was
so energetic she called out the figures before the fiddler did and
shrieked to my visavis to dance up to the entire strangermeaning ME
if you please

The voice appeared to come from the foliage that overhung the canyon
and the stranger even fancied he could detect through the shimmering
leafy veil something that moved monotonously to and fro Mystified and
impatient he made a hurried stride forward his foot struck a wooden
step and the next moment the mystery was made clear He had almost
stumbled upon the end of a long veranda that projected over the abyss
before a low modern dwelling till then invisible nestling on its
very brink The symmetricallytrimmed foliage he had noticed were the
luxuriant Madeira vines that hid the rude pillars of the veranda the
moving object was a rockingchair with its back towards the intruder
that disclosed only the brown hair above and the white skirts and small
slippered feet below of a seated female figure In the mean time a
second voice from the interior of the house had replied to the figure in
the chair who was evidently the first speaker

It must have been very funny but as long as Jim is always bringing
somebody over from the mill I dont see how I can go to those places
You were lucky my dear to escape from the new Division Superintendent
last night he was insufferable to Jim with his talk of his friend the
San Francisco millionaire and to me with his cheap society airs I do
hate a provincial fine gentleman

The situation was becoming embarrassing to the intruder At the
apparition of the woman the unaffected and simple directness he had
previously shown in his equally abrupt contact with Bradley had fled
utterly confused by the awkwardness of his arrival and shocked at the
idea of overhearing a private conversation he stepped hurriedly on the
veranda

Well go on said the second voice impatiently Well who else was
there WHAT did you say I dont hear you Whats the matter

The seated figure had risen from her chair and turned a young and
pretty face somewhat superciliously towards the stranger as she said in
a low tone to her unseen auditor Hush there is somebody here

The young man came forward with an awkwardness that was more boyish than
rustic His embarrassment was not lessened by the simultaneous entrance
from the open door of a second woman apparently as young as and
prettier than the first

I trust youll excuse me forforbeing so wretchedly stupid he
stammered but I really thought you know thatthatI was following
the trail totothe front of the house when I stumbled inin here

Long before he had finished both women by some simple feminine
intuition were relieved and even prepossessed by his voice and manner
They smiled graciously The latercomer pointed to the empty chair But
with his habit of pertinacious conscientiousness the stranger continued
It was regularly stupid wasnt itand I ought to have known better
I should have turned back and gone away when I found out what an ass I
was likely to be but I wasafraidyou know of alarming you by the
noise

Wont you sit down said the second lady pleasantly

Oh thanks Ive a letter hereIhe transferred his stick and hat
to his left hand as he felt in his breastpocket with his right But the
action was so awkward that the stick dropped on the veranda Both women
made a movement to restore it to its embarrassed owner who however
quickly anticipated them Pray dont mind it he continued with
accelerated breath and heightened color Ah heres the letter He
produced the note Bradley had returned to him Its mine in
factthat is I brought it to Mr Bradley He said I was to give it
tototoMrs Bradley He paused glancing embarrassedly from the
one to the other

Im Mrs Bradley said the prettiest one with a laugh He handed her
the letter It ran as follows

DEAR BRADLEYPut Mr Mainwaring through as far as he wants to go or
hang him up at The Lookout just as he likes The Banks behind him and
his hats chalked all over the Road but he dont care much about being
on velvet That aint his styleand youll like him Hes somebodys
son in England B

Mrs Bradley glanced simply at the first sentence Pray sit down Mr
Mainwaring she said gently or rather let me first introduce my
cousinMiss Macy

Thanks said Mainwaring with a bow to Miss Macy but
IIIthink he added conscientiously you did not notice that your
husband had written something across the paper

Mrs Bradley smiled and glanced at her husbands indorsementAll
right Wade in Its nothing but Jims slang she said with a laugh
and a slightly heightened color He ought not to have sent you by that
short cut its a bother and even dangerous for a stranger If you had
come directly to US by the road without making your first call at
the mill she added with a touch of coquetry you would have had a
pleasanter walk and seen US sooner I suppose however you got off the
stage at the mill

I was not on the coach said Mainwaring unfastening the strap of his
knapsack I walked over from Lone Pine Flat

Walked echoed both women in simultaneous astonishment

Yes returned Mainwaring simply laying aside his burden and taking
the proffered seat Its a very fine bit of country

Why its fifteen miles said Mrs Bradley glancing horrorstricken
at her cousin How dreadful And to think Jim could have sent you a
horse to Lone Pine Why you must be dead

Thanks Im all right I rather enjoyed it you know

But said Miss Macy glancing wonderingly at his knapsack you must
want something a changeor some refreshmentafter fifteen miles

Pray dont disturb yourself said Mainwaring rising hastily but not
quickly enough to prevent the young girl from slipping past him into the
house whence she rapidly returned with a decanter and glasses

Perhaps Mr Mainwaring would prefer to go into Jims room and wash his
hands and put on a pair of slippers said Mrs Bradley with gentle
concern

Thanks no I really am not tired I sent some luggage yesterday by the
coach to the Summit Hotel he said observing the womens eyes still
fixed upon his knapsack I dare say I can get them if I want them
Ive got a change here he continued lifting the knapsack as if with a
sudden sense of its incongruity with its surroundings and depositing it
on the end of the veranda

Do let it remain where it is said Mrs Bradley greatly amused and
pray sit still and take some refreshment Youll make yourself ill
after your exertions she added with a charming assumption of matronly
solicitude

But Im not at all deserving of your sympathy said Mainwaring with
a laugh Im awfully fond of walking and my usual constitutional isnt
much under this

Perhaps you were stronger than you are now said Mrs Bradley gazing
at him with a frank curiosity that however brought a faint deepening
of color to his cheek

I dare say youre right he said suddenly with an apologetic smile
I quite forgot that Im a sort of an invalid you know travelling
for my health Im not very strong here he added lightly tapping
his chest that now relieved of the bands of his knapsack appeared
somewhat thin and hollow in spite of his broad shoulders His voice
too had become less clear and distinct

Mrs Bradley who was still watching him here rose potentially You
ought to take more care of yourself she said You should begin by
eating this biscuit drinking that glass of whiskey and making yourself
more comfortable in Jims room until we can get the spare room fixed a
little

But I am not to be sent to bedam I asked Mainwaring in halfreal
halfamused consternation

Im not so sure of that said Mrs Bradley with playful precision
But for the present well let you off with a good wash and a nap
afterwards in that rockingchair while my cousin and I make some
little domestic preparations You see she added with a certain proud
humility weve got only one servanta Chinaman and there are many
things we cant leave to him

The color again rose in Mainwarings cheek but he had tact enough to
reflect that any protest or hesitation on his part at that moment would
only increase the difficulties of his gentle entertainers He allowed
himself to be ushered into the house by Mrs Bradley and shown to her
husbands room without perceiving that Miss Macy had availed herself of
his absence to run to the end of the veranda mischievously try to
lift the discarded knapsack to her own pretty shoulder but failing
heroically stagger with it into the passage and softly deposit it at his
door This done she pantingly rejoined her cousin in the kitchen

Well said Mrs Bradley emphatically DID you ever Walking fifteen
miles for pleasureand with such lungs

And that knapsack added Louise Macy pointing to the mark in her
little palm where the strap had imbedded itself in the soft flesh

Hes nice though isnt he said Mrs Bradley tentatively

Yes said Miss Macy he isnt certainly one of those provincial
fine gentlemen you object to But DID you see his shoes I suppose they
make the miles go quickly or seem to measure less by comparison

Theyre probably more serviceable than those highheeled things that
Captain Greyson hops about in

But the Captain always ridesand rides very wellyou know said
Louise reflectively There was a moments pause

I suppose Jim will tell us all about him said Mrs Bradley
dismissing the subject as she turned her sleeves back over her white
arms preparatory to grappling certain culinary difficulties

Jim observed Miss Macy shortly in my opinion knows nothing more
than his note says Thats like Jim

Theres nothing more to know really said Mrs Bradley with a
superior air Hes undoubtedly the son of some Englishman of fortune
sent out here for his health

Hush

Miss Macy had heard a step in the passage It halted at last half
irresolutely before the open door of the kitchen and the stranger
appeared with an embarrassed air

But in his brief absence he seemed to have completely groomed himself
and stood there the impersonation of closecropped clean and
wholesome English young manhood The two women appreciated it with
catlike fastidiousness

I beg your pardon but really youre going to let a fellow do something
for you he said just to keep him from looking like a fool I really
can do no end of things you know if youll try me Ive done some
campingout and can cook as well as the next man

The two women made a movement of smiling remonstrance half coquettish
and half superior until Mrs Bradley becoming conscious of her bare
arms and the strangers wandering eyes colored faintly and said with
more decision

Certainly not Youd only be in the way Besides you need rest more
than we do Put yourself in the rockingchair in the veranda and go to
sleep until Mr Bradley comes

Mainwaring saw that she was serious and withdrew a little ashamed at
his familiarity into which his boyishness had betrayed him But he had
scarcely seated himself in the rockingchair before Miss Macy appeared
carrying with both hands a large tin basin of unshelled peas

There she said pantingly placing her burden in his lap if you
really want to help theres something to do that isnt very fatiguing
You may shell these peas

SHELL themI beg pardon but how he asked with smiling earnestness

How Why Ill show youlook

She frankly stepped beside him so close that her fullskirted dress
half encompassed him and the basin in a delicious confusion and
leaning over his lap with her left hand picked up a peacod which
with a single movement of her charming little right thumb she broke at
the end and stripped the green shallow of its tiny treasures

He watched her with smiling eyes her own looking down on him were
very bright and luminous There thats easy enough she said and
turned away

Butone moment MissMiss

Macy said louise

Where am I to put the shells

Oh throw them down theretheres room enough

She was pointing to the canyon below The veranda actually projected
over its brink and seemed to hang in mid air above it Mainwaring
almost mechanically threw his arm out to catch the incautious girl who
had stepped heedlessly to its extreme edge

How odd Dont you find it rather dangerous here he could not help
saying I meanyou might have had a railing that wouldnt intercept
the view and yet be safe

Its a fancy of Mr Bradleys returned the young girl carelessly
Its all like this The house was built on a ledge against the side of
the precipice and the road suddenly drops down to it

Its tremendously pretty all the same you know said the young man
thoughtfully gazing however at the girls rounded chin above him

Yes she replied curtly But this isnt working I must go back to
Jenny You can shell the peas until Mr Bradley comes home He wont be
long

She turned away and reentered the house Without knowing why he
thought her withdrawal abrupt and he was again feeling his ready color
rise with the suspicion of either having been betrayed by the young
girls innocent fearlessness into some unpardonable familiarity which
she had quietly resented or of feeling an ease and freedom in the
company of these two women that were inconsistent with respect and
should be restrained

He however began to apply himself to the task given to him with his
usual conscientiousness of duty and presently acquired a certain manual
dexterity in the operation It was good fun to throw the castoff
husks into the mighty unfathomable void before him and watch them
linger with suspended gravity in mid air for a momentapparently
motionlessuntil they either lost themselves a mere vanishing black
spot in the thin ether or slid suddenly at a sharp angle into unknown
shadow How deuced odd for him to be sitting here in this fashion It
would be something to talk of hereafter and yethe stoppedit was
not at all in the line of that characteristic adventure uncivilized
novelty and barbarous freedom which for the last month he had sought
and experienced It was not at all like his meeting with the grizzly
last week while wandering in a lonely canyon not a bit in the line of
his chance acquaintance with that notorious ruffian Spanish Jack or
his witnessing with his own eyes that actual lynching affair at Angels
No Nor was it at all characteristic according to his previous ideas of
frontier rural seclusionas for instance the Pike County cabin of the
family where he stayed one night and where the handsome daughter asked
him what his Christian name was No These two young women were very
unlike her they seemed really quite the equals of his family and
friends in Englandperhaps more attractiveand yet yes it was
this very attractiveness that alarmed his inbred social conservatism
regarding women With a man it was very different that alert active
intelligent husband instinct with the throbbing life of his sawmill
creator and worker in one challenged his unqualified trust and
admiration

He had become conscious for the last minute or two of thinking rapidly
and becoming feverishly excited of breathing with greater difficulty
and a renewed tendency to cough The tendency increased until he
instinctively put aside the pan from his lap and half rose But even
that slight exertion brought on an accession of coughing He put his
handkerchief to his lips partly to keep the sound from disturbing the
women in the kitchen partly because of a certain significant taste
in his mouth which he unpleasantly remembered When he removed the
handkerchief it was as he expected spotted with blood He turned
quickly and reentered the house softly regaining the bedroom without
attracting attention An increasing faintness here obliged him to lie
down on the bed until it should pass

Everything was quiet He hoped they would not discover his absence from
the veranda until he was better it was deucedly awkward that he should
have had this attack just nowand after he had made so light of his
previous exertions They would think him an effeminate fraud these two
bright active women and that alert energetic man A faint color came
into his cheek at the idea and an uneasy sense that he had been in some
way foolishly imprudent about his health Again they might be alarmed
at missing him from the veranda perhaps he had better have remained
there perhaps he ought to tell them that he had concluded to take their
advice and lie down He tried to rise but the deep blue chasm before
the window seemed to be swelling up to meet him the bed slowly sinking
into its oblivious profundity He knew no more

He came to with the smell and taste of some powerful volatile spirit
and the vague vision of Mr Bradley still standing at the window of
the mill and vibrating with the machinery this changed presently to a
pleasant lassitude and lazy curiosity as he perceived Mr Bradley smile
and apparently slip from the window of the mill to his bedside Youre
all right now said Bradley cheerfully

He was feeling Mainwarings pulse Had he really been ill and was
Bradley a doctor

Bradley evidently saw what was passing in his mind Dont be alarmed
he said gayly Im not a doctor but I practise a little medicine and
surgery on account of the men at the mill and accidents you know
Youre all right now youve lost a little blood but in a couple of
weeks in this air well have that tubercle healed and youll be as
right as a trivet

In a couple of weeks echoed Mainwaring in faint astonishment Why
I leave here tomorrow

Youll do nothing of the kind said Mrs Bradley with smiling
peremptoriness suddenly slipping out from behind her husband
Everything is all perfectly arranged Jim has sent off messengers to
your friends so that if you cant come to them they can come to you
You see you cant help yourself If you WILL walk fifteen miles with
such lungs and then frighten people to death you must abide by the
consequences

You see the old lady has fixed you said Bradley smiling and shes
the master here Come Mainwaring you can send any other message you
like and have who and what you want here but HERE you must stop for a
while

But did I frighten you really stammered Mainwaring faintly to Mrs
Bradley

Frighten us said Mrs Bradley Well look there

She pointed to the window which commanded a view of the veranda Miss
Macy had dropped into the vacant chair with her little feet stretched
out before her her cheeks burning with heat and fire her eyes partly
closed her straw hat hanging by a ribbon round her neck her brown
hair clinging to her ears and forehead in damp tendrils and an enormous
palmleaf fan in each hand violently playing upon this charming picture
of exhaustion and abandonment

She came tearing down to the mill barebacked on our halfbroken
mustang about half an hour ago to call me to help you explained
Bradley Heaven knows how she managed to do it




CHAPER II


The medication of the woods was not overestimated by Bradley There was
surely some occult healing property in that vast reservoir of balmy and
resinous odors over which The Lookout beetled and clung and from which
at times the pure exhalations of the terraced valley seemed to rise
Under its remedial influence and a conscientious adherence to the rules
of absolute rest and repose laid down for him Mainwaring had no return
of the hemorrhage The nearest professional medical authority hastily
summoned saw no reason for changing or for supplementing Bradleys
intelligent and simple treatment although astounded that the patient
had been under no more radical or systematic cure than travel and
exercise The women especially were amazed that Mainwaring had taken
nothing for it in their habitual experience of an unfettered
pillandelixirconsuming democracy In their knowledge of the thousand
panaceas that filled the shelves of the general store this singular
abstention of their guest seemed to indicate a national peculiarity

His bed was moved beside the low window from which he could not only
view the veranda but converse at times with its occupants and even
listen to the book which Miss Macy seated without read aloud to him
In the evening Bradley would linger by his couch until late beguiling
the tedium of his convalescence with characteristic stories and
information which he thought might please the invalid For Mainwaring
who had been early struck with Bradleys ready and cultivated
intelligence ended by shyly avoiding the discussion of more serious
topics partly because Bradley impressed him with a suspicion of his
own inferiority and partly because Mainwaring questioned the taste of
Bradleys apparent exhibition of his manifest superiority He learned
accidentally that this millowner and backwoodsman was a collegebred
man but the practical application of that education to the ordinary
affairs of life was new to the young Englishmans traditions and grated
a little harshly on his feelings He would have been quite content if
Bradley had like himself and fellows he knew undervalued his training
and kept his gifts conservatively impractical The knowledge also that
his hosts education naturally came from some provincial institution
unlike Oxford and Cambridge may have unconsciously affected his general
estimate I say unconsciously for his strict conscientiousness would
have rejected any such formal proposition

Another trifle annoyed him He could not help noticing also that
although Bradleys manner and sympathy were confidential and almost
brotherly he never made any allusion to Mainwarings own family or
connections and in fact gave no indication of what he believed was
the national curiosity in regard to strangers Somewhat embarrassed by
this indifference Mainwaring made the occasion of writing some letters
home an opportunity for laughingly alluding to the fact that he had made
his mother and his sisters fully aware of the great debt they owed the
household of The Lookout

Theyll probably all send you a round robin of thanks except perhaps
my next brother Bob

Bradley contented himself with a gesture of general deprecation and did
not ask WHY Mainwarings young brother should contemplate his death with
satisfaction Nevertheless some time afterwards Miss Macy remarked
that it seemed hard that the happiness of one member of a family should
depend upon a calamity to another As for instance asked Mainwaring
who had already forgotten the circumstance Why if you had died and
your younger brother succeeded to the baronetcy and become Sir Robert
Mainwaring responded Miss Macy with precision This was the first and
only allusion to his family and prospective rank On the other hand
he hadthrough naive and boyish inquiries which seemed to amuse his
entertainersacquired as he believed a full knowledge of the history
and antecedents of the Bradley household He knew how Bradley had
brought his young wife and her cousin to California and abandoned a
lucrative law practice in San Francisco to take possession of this
mountain mill and woodland which he had acquired through some
professional service

Then you are a barrister really said Mainwaring gravely

Bradley laughed Im afraid Ive had more practicethough not as
lucrative a oneas surgeon or doctor

But youre regularly on the rolls you know youre entered as
Counsel and all that sort of thing continued Mainwaring with great
seriousness

Well yes replied Bradley much amused Im afraid I must plead
guilty to that

Its not a bad sort of thing said Mainwaring naively ignoring
Bradleys amusement Ive got a cousin whos gone in for the law Got
out of the army to do ittoo Hes a sharp fellow

Then you DO allow a man to try many tradesover there said Miss
Macy demurely

Yes sometimes said Mainwaring graciously but by no means certain
that the case was at all analogous

Nevertheless as if relieved of certain doubts of the conventional
quality of his hosts attainments he now gave himself up to a very
hearty and honest admiration of Bradley You know its awfully kind of
him to talk to a fellow like me who just pulled through and never got
any prizes at Oxford and dont understand the half of these things he
remarked confidentially to Mrs Bradley He knows more about the things
we used to go in for at Oxford than lots of our men and hes never been
there Hes uncommonly clever

Jim was always very brilliant returned Mrs Bradley indifferently
and with more than even conventionally polite wifely deprecation I
wish he were more practical

Practical Oh I say Mrs Bradley Why a fellow that can go in among
a lot of workmen and tell them just what to doan allround chap
that can be independent of his valet his doctor and hisbanker By
JoveTHATS practical

I mean said Mrs Bradley coldly that there are some things that
a gentleman ought not to be practical about nor independent of Mr
Bradley would have done better to have used his talents in some more
legitimate and established way

Mainwaring looked at her in genuine surprise To his inexperienced
observation Bradleys intelligent energy and above all his
originality ought to have been priceless in the eyes of his wifethe
American female of his species He felt that slight shock which most
loyal or logical men feel when first brought face to face with the easy
disloyalty and incomprehensible logic of the feminine affections Here
was a fellow by Jove that any woman ought to be proud of andandhe
stopped blankly He wondered if Miss Macy sympathized with her cousin

Howbeit this did not affect the charm of their idyllic life at The
Lookout The precipice over which they hung was as charming as ever
in its poetic illusions of space and depth and color the isolation of
their comfortable existence in the tasteful yet audacious habitation
the pleasant routine of daily tasks and amusements all tended to make
the enforced quiet and inaction of his convalescence a lazy recreation
He was really improving more than that he was conscious of a certain
satisfaction in this passive observation of novelty that was healthier
and perhaps TRUER than his previous passion for adventure and that
febrile desire for change and excitement which he now felt was a part
of his disease Nor were incident and variety entirely absent from this
tranquil experience He was one day astonished at being presented by
Bradley with copies of the latest English newspapers procured from
Sacramento and he equally astonished his host after profusely thanking
him by only listlessly glancing at their columns He estopped a
proposed visit from one of his influential countrymen in the absence
of his fair entertainers at their domestic duties he extracted infinite
satisfaction from FooYup the Chinese servant who was particularly
detached for his service From his invalid coign of vantage at the
window he was observant of all that passed upon the veranda that
alfresco audienceroom of The Lookout and he was goodhumoredly
conscious that a great many eccentric and peculiar visitors were
invariably dragged thither by Miss Macy and goaded into characteristic
exhibition within sight and hearing of her guest with a too evident
view under the ostentatious excuse of extending his knowledge of
national character or mischievously shocking him

When you are strong enough to stand Captain Gashweilers opinions of
the Established Church and Chinamen said Miss Macy after one of these
revelations Ill get Jim to bring him here for really he swears
so outrageously that even in the broadest interests of international
understanding and goodwill neither Mrs Bradley nor myself could be
present

On another occasion she provokingly lingered before his window for a
moment with a rifle slung jauntily over her shoulder If you hear a
shot or two dont excite yourself and believe were having a lynching
case in the woods It will be only me Theres some creatureconfess
you expected me to say critterhanging round the barn It may be a
bear Goodby She missed the creaturewhich happened to be really a
bearmuch to Mainwarings illogical satisfaction I wonder why he
reflected with vague uneasiness she doesnt leave all that sort of
thing to girls like that towheaded girl at the blacksmiths

It chanced however that this blacksmiths towheaded daughter who it
may be incidentally remarked had the additional eccentricities of large
black eyes and large white teeth came to the fore in quite another
fashion Shortly after this Mainwaring being able to leave his room and
join the family board Mrs Bradley found it necessary to enlarge
her domestic service and arranged with her nearest neighbor the
blacksmith to allow his daughter to come to The Lookout for a few
days to do the chores and assist in the housekeeping as she had on
previous occasions The day of her advent Bradley entered Mainwarings
room and closing the door mysteriously fixed his blue eyes kindling
with mischief on the young Englishman

You are aware my dear boy he began with affected gravity that you
are now living in a land of liberty where mere artificial distinctions
are not known and where Freedom from her mountain heights generally
levels all social positions I think you have graciously admitted that
fact

I know Ive been taking a tremendous lot of freedom with you and yours
old man and its a deuced shame interrupted Mainwaring with a faint
smile

And that nowhere continued Bradley with immovable features does
equality exist as perfectly as above yonder unfathomable abyss where
you have also doubtless observed the American eagle proudly soars and
screams defiance

Then that was the fellow that kept me awake this morning and made me
wonder if I was strong enough to hold a gun again

That wouldnt have settled the matter continued Bradley
imperturbably The case is simply this Miss Minty Sharpe that
blacksmiths daughter has once or twice consented for a slight
emolument to assist in our domestic service for a day or two and she
comes back again today Now under the aegis of that noble bird whom
your national instincts tempt you to destroy she has on all previous
occasions taken her meals with us at the same table on terms of
perfect equality She will naturally expect to do the same now Mrs
Bradley thought it proper therefore to warn you that in case your
health was not quite equal to this democratic simplicity you could
still dine in your room

It would be great funif Miss Sharpe wont object to my presence

But it must not be great fun returned Bradley more seriously for
Miss Mintys perception of humor is probably as keen as yours and she
would be quick to notice it And so far from having any objection
to you I am inclined to think that we owe her consent to come to her
desire of making your acquaintance

She will find my conduct most exemplary said Mainwaring earnestly

Let us hope so concluded Bradley with unabated gravity And now
that you have consented let me add from my own experience that Miss
Mintys lemonpies alone are worthy of any concession

The dinnerhour came Mainwaring a little pale and interesting leaning
on the arm of Bradley crossed the hall and for the first time entered
the diningroom of the house where he had lodged for three weeks It
was a bright cheerful apartment giving upon the laurels of the rocky
hillside and permeated like the rest of the house with the wholesome
spice of the valleyan odor that in its pure desiccating property
seemed to obliterate all flavor of alien human habitation and even to
dominate and etherealize the appetizing smell of the viands before
them The bare shining planed boarded walls appeared to resent any
decoration that might have savored of dust decay or moisture The four
large windows and long open door set in scanty strips of the plainest
spotless muslin framed in themselves pictures of woods and rock and sky
of limitless depth color and distance that made all other adornment
impertinent Nature invading the room at every opening had banished
Art from those neutral walls

Its like a picnic with comfort said Mainwaring glancing round him
with boyish appreciation Miss Minty was not yet there the Chinaman
was alone in attendance Mainwaring could not help whispering half
mischievously to Louise You draw the line at Chinamen I suppose

WE dont but HE does answered the young girl He considers us his
social inferiors Buthush

Minty Sharpe had just entered the room and was advancing with smiling
confidence towards the table Mainwaring was a little startled he had
seen Minty in a holland sunbonnet and turned up skirt crossing
the veranda only a moment before in the brief instant between the
dishingup of dinner and its actual announcement she had managed to
change her dress put on a clean collar cuffs and a large jet brooch
and apply some odorous unguent to her rebellious hair Her face
guiltless of powder or cold cream was still shining with the healthy
perspiration of her last labors as she promptly took the vacant chair
beside Mainwaring

Dont mind me folks she said cheerfully resting her plump elbow on
the table and addressing the company generally but gazing with frank
curiosity into the face of the young man at her side It was a keen
jump I tell yer to get out of my old duds inter these and look
decent inside o five minutes But I reckon I aint kept yer waitin
longleast of all this yer sick stranger But youre looking pearter
than you did Youre wonderin like ez not where I ever saw ye before
she continued laughing Well Ill tell you Last week Id kem over
yer on a chance of seein Jenny Bradley and while I was meanderin down
the veranda I saw you lyin back in your chair by the window drowned
in sleep like a baby Lordy I mout hev won a pair o gloves but I
reckoned you were Loos game and not mine

The slightly constrained laugh which went round the table after Miss
Mintys speech was due quite as much to the faint flush that had
accented Mainwarings own smile as to the embarrassing remark itself
Mrs Bradley and Miss Macy exchanged rapid glances Bradley who alone
retained his composure with a slight flicker of amusement in the corner
of his eye and nostril said quickly You see Mainwaring how nature
stands ready to help your convalescence at every turn If Miss Minty
had only followed up her healing opportunity your cure would have been
complete

Ye mout hev left some o that pretty talk for HIM to say said Minty
taking up her knife and fork with a slight shrug and you neednt call
me MISS Minty either jest because theres kempeny present

I hope you wont look upon me as company Minty or I shall be obliged
to call you Miss too said Mainwaring unexpectedly regaining his
usual frankness

Bradleys face brightened Miss Minty raised her black eyes from her
plate with still broader appreciation

Theres nothin mean about that she said showing her white teeth
Well whats YOUR first name

Not as pretty as yours Im afraid Its Frank

No it aint its Francis You reckon to be Sir Francis some day she
said gravely You cant play any Frank off on me You wouldnt do it on
HER she added indicating Louise with her elbow

A momentous silence followed The particular form that Mintys vulgarity
had taken had not been anticipated by the two other women They had
not unreasonably expected some original audacity or gaucherie from the
blacksmiths daughter which might astonish yet amuse their guest and
condone for the situation forced upon them But they were not prepared
for a playfulness that involved themselves in a ridiculous indiscretion
Mrs Bradleys eyes sought her husbands meaningly Louises pretty
mouth hardened Luckily the cheerful cause of it suddenly jumped up
from the table and saying that the stranger was starving insisted upon
bringing a dish from the other side and helping him herself plentifully
Mainwaring rose gallantly to take the dish from her hand a slight
scuffle ensued which ended in the young man being forced down in his
chair by the pressure of Mintys strong plump hand on his shoulder
There she said ye kin mind your dinner now and I reckon well give
the others a chance to chip into the conversation and at once applied
herself to the plate before her

The conversation presently became general with the exception that
Minty more or less engrossed by professional anxiety in the quality
of the dinner and occasional hurried visits to the kitchen briefly
answered the few polite remarks which Mainwaring felt called upon to
address to her Nevertheless he was conscious malgre her rallying
allusions to Miss Macy that he felt none of the vague yet half pleasant
anxiety with which Louise was beginning to inspire him He felt at
ease in Mintys presence and believed rightly or wrongly that she
understood him as well as he understood her And there were certainly
points in common between his two hostesses and their humbler though
proud dependent The social evolution of Mrs Bradley and Louise
Macy from some previous Minty was neither remote nor complete the
selfsufficient independence ease and quiet selfassertion were alike
in each The superior position was still too recent and accidental for
either to resent or criticise qualities that were common to both At
least this was what he thought when not abandoning himself to the
gratification of a convalescent appetite to the presence of two pretty
women the sympathy of a genial friend the healthy intoxication of the
white sunlight that glanced upon the pine walls the views that mirrored
themselves in the open windows and the pure atmosphere in which The
Lookout seemed to swim Wandering breezes of balm and spice lightly
stirred the flowers on the table and seemed to fan his hair and
forehead with softly healing breath Looking up in an interval of
silence he caught Bradleys gray eyes fixed upon him with a subdued
light of amusement and affection as of an elder brother regarding a
schoolboys boisterous appetite at some feast Mainwaring laid down
his knife and fork with a laughing color touched equally by Bradleys
fraternal kindliness and the consciousness of his gastronomical powers

Hang it Bradley look here I know my appetites disgraceful but what
can a fellow do In such air with such viands and such company Its
like the bees getting drunk on Hybla and Hymettus you know Im not
responsible

Its the first square meal I believe youve really eaten in six
months said Bradley gravely I cant understand why your doctor
allowed you to run down so dreadfully

I reckon you aint as keerful of yourself you Britishers ez us said
Minty Lordy Why theres Pop invests in more patent medicines in one
day than you have in two weeks and hed make two of you Mebbe your
folks dont look after you enough

Im a splendid advertisement of what YOUR care and your medicines have
done said Mainwaring gratefully to Mrs Bradley and if you ever
want to set up a Cure here Im ready with a tenpage testimonial

Have a care Mainwaring said Bradley laughing that the ladies
dont take you at your word Louise and Jenny have been doing their
best for the last year to get me to accept a flattering offer from
a Sacramento firm to put up a hotel for tourists on the site of The
Lookout Why I believe that they have already secretly in their
hearts concocted a flaming prospectus of Unrivalled Scenery and
Healthgiving Air and are looking forward to Saturday night hops on
the piazza

Have you really though said Mainwaring gazing from the one to the
other

We should certainly see more company than we do now and feel a little
less out of the world said Louise candidly There are no neighbors
hereI mean the people at the Summit are not she added with a slight
glance towards Minty

And Mr Bradley would find it more profitablenot to say more suitable
to a man of his positionthan this wretched sawmill and timber
business said Mrs Bradley decidedly

Mainwaring was astounded was it possible they considered it more
dignified for a lawyer to keep a hotel than a sawmill Bradley as if
answering what was passing in his mind said mischievously Im
not sure exactly what my position is my dear and Im afraid Ive
declined the hotel on business principles But by the way Mainwaring
I found a letter at the mill this morning from Mr Richardson He is
about to pay us the distinguished honor of visiting The Lookout solely
on your account my dear fellow

But I wrote him that I was much better and it wasnt necessary for him
to come said Mainwaring

He makes an excuse of some law business with me I suppose he considers
the mere fact of his taking the trouble to come here all the way from
San Francisco a sufficient honor to justify any absence of formal
invitation said Bradley smiling

But hes onlyI mean hes my fathers banker said Mainwaring
correcting himself andyou dont keep a hotel

Not yet returned Bradley with a mischievous glance at the two women
but The Lookout is elastic and I dare say we can manage to put him
up

A silence ensued It seemed as if some shadow or momentary darkening
of the brilliant atmosphere some film across the mirrorlike expanse of
the open windows or misty dimming of their wholesome light had arisen
to their elevation Mainwaring felt that he was looking forward with
unreasoning indignation and uneasiness to this impending interruption
of their idyllic life Mrs Bradley and Louise who had become a
little more constrained and formal under Mintys freedom were less
sympathetic even the irrepressible Minty appeared absorbed in the
responsibilities of the dinner

Bradley alone preserved his usual patient goodhumor Well take
our coffee on the veranda and the ladies will join us by and by
Mainwaring besides I dont know that I can allow you as an invalid
to go entirely through Mintys bountiful menu at present You shall have
the sweets another time

When they were alone on the veranda he said between the puffs of his
black brierwood pipea pet aversion of Mrs BradleyI wonder how
Richardson will accept Minty

If I can I think he MUST returned Mainwaring dryly By Jove it
will be great fun to see him buthe stopped and hesitatedI dont
know about the ladies I dont think you know that theyll stand Minty
again before another stranger

Bradley glanced quickly at the young man their eyes met and they both
joined in a superior and I fear disloyal smile After a pause Bradley
as if in a spirit of further confidence took his pipe from his mouth
and pointed to the blue abyss before them

Look at that profundity Mainwaring and think of it ever being bullied
and overawed by a long verandaload of gaping patronizing tourists
and the idiotic flirting females of their species Think of a lot of
overdressed creatures flouting those severe outlines and deeptoned
distances with frippery and garishness You know how you have been
lulled to sleep by that delicious indefinite faroff murmur of
the canyon at nightthink of it being broken by a crazy waltz or a
monotonous germanby the clatter of waiters and the pop of champagne
corks And yet by thunder those women are capable of liking both and
finding no discord in them

Dancing aint half bad you know said Mainwaring conscientiously
if a chaps got the wind to do it and all Americans especially the
women dance better than we do But I say Bradley to hear you talk
a fellow wouldnt suspect you were as big a Vandal as anybody with a
beastly howling sawmill in the heart of the primeval forest By Jove
you quite bowled me over that first day we met when you popped your
head out of that delirium tremens shaking mill like the very genius of
destructive improvement

But that was FIGHTING Nature not patronizing her and its a business
that pays That reminds me that I must go back to it said Bradley
rising and knocking the ashes from his pipe

Not AFTER dinner surely said Mainwaring in surprise Come now
thats too much like the bolting Yankee of the travellers books

Theres a heavy run to get through tonight Were working against
time returned Bradley Even while speaking he had vanished within the
house returned quicklyhaving replaced his dark suit by jean trousers
tucked in heavy boots and a red flannel shirt over his starched white
oneand nodding gayly to Mainwaring stepped from the lower end of the
veranda The beggar actually looks pleased to go said Mainwaring to
himself in wonderment

Oh Jim said Mrs Bradley appearing at the door

Yes said Bradley faintly from the bushes

Mintys ready You might take her home

All right Ill wait

I hope I havent frightened Miss Sharpe away said Mainwaring She
isnt going surely

Only to get some better clothes on account of company Im afraid
you are giving her a good deal of trouble Mr Mainwaring said Mrs
Bradley laughing

She wished me to say goodby to you for her as she couldnt come on
the veranda in her old shawl and sunbonnet added Louise who had
joined them What do you really think of her Mr Mainwaring I call
her quite pretty at times Dont you

Mainwaring knew not what to say He could not understand why they
could have any special interest in the girl or care to know what he a
perfect stranger thought of her He avoided a direct reply however by
playfully wondering how Mrs Bradley could subject her husband to Miss
Mintys undivided fascinations

Oh Jim always takes her homeif its in the evening He gets along
with these people better than we do returned Mrs Bradley
dryly But she added with a return of her piquant Quakerlike
coquettishness Jim says we are to devote ourselves to you tonightin
retaliation I suppose We are to amuse you and not let you get
excited and you are to be sent to bed early

It is to be feared that these latter wise precautionsinvaluable for
all defenceless and enfeebled humanitywere not carried out and it
was late when Mainwaring eventually retired with brightened eyes and a
somewhat accelerated pulse For the ladies who had quite regained that
kindly equanimity which Minty had rudely interrupted had also added
a delicate and confidential sympathy in their relations with
Mainwaringas of people who had suffered in commonand he
experienced these tender attentions at their hands which any two women
are emboldened by each others saving presence to show any single member
of our sex Indeed he hardly knew if his satisfaction was the more
complete when Mrs Bradley withdrawing for a few moments left him
alone on the veranda with Louise and the vast omnipotent night

For a while they sat silent in the midst of the profound and
measureless calm Looking down upon the dim moonlit abyss at their feet
they themselves seemed a part of this night that arched above it the
halfrisen moon appeared to linger long enough at their side to enwrap
and suffuse them with its glory a few bright stars quietly ringed
themselves around them and looked wonderingly into the level of their
own shining eyes For some vague yearning to humanity seemed to draw
this dark and passionless void towards them The vast protecting
maternity of Nature leant hushed and breathless over the solitude Warm
currents of air rose occasionally from the valley which one might have
believed were sighs from its full and overflowing breast or a grateful
coolness swept their cheeks and hair when the tranquil heights around
them were moved to slowly respond Odors from invisible bay and
laurel sometimes filled the air the incense of some rare and remoter
cultivated meadow beyond their ken or the strong germinating breath
of leagues of wild oats that had yellowed the upland by day In the
silence and shadow their voices took upon themselves almost without
their volition a faroff confidential murmur with intervals of meaning
silencerather as if their thoughts had spoken for themselves and they
had stopped wonderingly to listen They talked at first vaguely to this
discreet audience of space and darkness and then growing bolder spoke
to each other and of themselves Invested by the infinite gravity of
nature they had no fear of human ridicule to restrain their youthful
conceit or the extravagance of their unimportant confessions
They talked of their tastes of their habits of their friends
and acquaintances They settled some points of doctrine duty and
etiquette with the sweet seriousness of youth and its allpowerful
convictions The listening vines would have recognized no flirtation or
lovemaking in their animated but important confidences yet when Mrs
Bradley reappeared to warn the invalid that it was time to seek his
couch they both coughed slightly in the nervous consciousness of some
unaccustomed quality in their voices and a sense of interruption far
beyond their own or the innocent intruders ken

Well said Mrs Bradley in the sittingroom as Mainwarings steps
retreated down the passage to his room

Well said Louise with a slight yawn leaning her pretty shoulders
languidly against the doorpost as she shaded her moonlightaccustomed
eyes from the vulgar brilliancy of Mrs Bradleys bedroom candle
Welloh he talked a great deal about his people as he called them
and I talked about us Hes very nice You know in some things hes
really like a boy

He looks much better

Yes but he is far from strong yet

Meantime Mainwaring had no other confidant of his impressions than his
own thoughts Mingled with his exaltation which was the more seductive
that it had no welldefined foundation for existing and implied
no future responsibility was a recurrence of his uneasiness at the
impending visit of Richardson the next day Strangely enough it had
increased under the stimulus of the evening Just as he was really
getting on with the family he felt sure that this visitor would import
some foreign element into their familiarity as Minty had done It was
possible they would not like him now he remembered there was
really something ostentatiously British and insular about this
Richardsonsomething they would likely resent Why couldnt this fellow
have come lateror even before Before what But here he fell asleep
and almost instantly slipped from this veranda in the Sierras six
thousand miles away to an ancient terrace overgrown with moss and
tradition that overlooked the sedate glory of an English park Here he
found himself restricted painfully by his inconsistent nightclothes
endeavoring to impress his mother and sisters with the singular
virtues and excellences of his American host and hostessesvirtues and
excellences that he himself was beginning to feel conscious had become
more or less apocryphal in that atmosphere He heard his mothers voice
saying severely When you learn Francis to respect the opinions and
prejudices of your family enough to prevent your appearing before them
in this uncivilized aboriginal costume we will listen to what you have
to say of the friends whose habits you seem to have adopted and he
was frantically indignant that his efforts to convince them that his
negligence was a personal oversight and not a Californian custom
were utterly futile But even then this vision was brushed away by the
bewildering sweep of Louises pretty skirt across the dreamy picture
and her delicate features and softlyfringed eyes remained the last to
slip from his fading consciousness

The moon rose higher and higher above the sleeping house and softly
breathing canyon There was nothing to mar the idyllic repose of the
landscape only the growing light of the last two hours had brought out
in the far eastern horizon a dim white peak that gleamed faintly among
the stars like a bridal couch spread between the hills fringed with
fading nuptial torches No one would have believed that behind that
impenetrable shadow to the west in the heart of the forest the
throbbing sawmill of James Bradley was even at that moment eating its
destructive way through the conserved growth of Nature and centuries
and that the refined proprietor of house and greenwood with the glow of
his furnace fires on his red shirt and his alert intelligent eyes was
the genie of that devastation and the toiling leader of the shadowy
toiling figures around him




CHAPER III


Amid the beauty of the most uncultivated and untrodden wilderness there
are certain localities where the meaner and mere common processes
of Nature take upon themselves a degrading likeness to the slovenly
wasteful and improvident processes of man The unrecorded landslip
disintegrating a whole hillside will not only lay bare the delicate
framework of strata and deposit to the vulgar eye but hurl into the
valley a debris so monstrous and unlovely as to shame even the hideous
ruins left by dynamite hydraulic or pick and shovel an overflown and
forgotten woodland torrent will leave in some remote hollow a disturbed
and ungraceful chaos of inextricable logs branches rock and soil that
will rival the unsavory details of some wrecked or abandoned settlement
Of lesser magnitude and importance there are certain natural
dustheaps sinks and cesspools where the elements have collected the
castoff broken and frayed disjecta of wood and fieldthe sweepings
of the sylvan household It was remarkable that Nature so kindly
considerate of mere human ruins made no attempt to cover up or disguise
these monuments of her own mortality no grass grew over the unsightly
landslides no moss or ivy clothed the stripped and bleached skeletons
of overthrown branch and tree the dead leaves and withered husks rotted
in their open grave uncrossed by vine and creeper Even the animals
except the lower organizations shunned those haunts of decay and ruin

It was scarcely a hundred yards from one of those dreary receptacles
that Mr Bradley had taken leave of Miss Minty Sharpe The cabin
occupied by her father herself and a younger brother stood in fact
on the very edge of the little hollow which was partly filled with
decayed wood leaves and displacements of the crumbling bank with
the coal dust and ashes which Mr Sharpe had added from his forge that
stood a few paces distant at the corner of a crossroad The occupants
of the cabin had also contributed to the hollow the refuse of their
household in broken boxes earthenware tin cans and castoff clothing
and it is not improbable that the site of the cabin was chosen with
reference to this convenient disposal of useless and encumbering
impedimenta It was true that the locality offered little choice in
the way of beauty An outcrop of brown granitea portent of higher
altitudesextended a quarter of a mile from the nearest fringe of dwarf
laurel and brush in one direction in the other an advanced file of
Bradleys woods had suffered from some longforgotten fire and still
raised its blackened masts and broken stumps over the scorched and arid
soil swept of older underbrush and verdure On the other side of the
road a dark ravine tangled with briers and haunted at night by owls and
wild cats struggled wearily on until blundering at last upon the edge
of the Great Canyon it slipped and lost itself forever in a single
furrow of those mighty flanks When Bradley had once asked Sharpe why he
had not built his house in the ravine the blacksmith had replied That
until the Lord had appointed his time he reckoned to keep his head
above ground and the foundations thereof Howbeit the ravine or the
run as it was locally known was Mintys only Saturday afternoon
resort for recreation or berries It was she had explained powful
soothin and solitary

She entered the housea rude square building of unpainted
boardscontaining a sittingroom a kitchen and two bedrooms A glance
at these rooms which were plainly furnished and whose canvascolored
walls were adorned with gorgeous agricultural implement
circulars patent medicine calendars with polytinted chromos and
cheaplyilluminated Scriptural texts showed her that a certain neatness
and order had been preserved during her absence and finding the house
empty she crossed the barren and blackened intervening space between
the back door and her fathers forge and entered the open shed The
light was fading from the sky but the glow of the forge lit up the
dusty road before it and accented the blackness of the rocky ledge
beyond A small curlyheaded boy bearing a singular likeness to a
smudged and blackened crayon drawing of Minty was mechanically
blowing the bellows and obviously intent upon something else while her
fathera powerfully built man with a quaintly dissatisfied expression
of countenancewas with equal want of interest mechanically hammering
at a horseshoe Without noticing Mintys advent he lazily broke into a
querulous drawling chant of some vague religious character

 O turren sinner turren
 For the Lord bids you turnah
 O turren sinner turren
 Why will you die

The musical accent adapted itself to the monotonous fall of the
sledgehammer and at every repetition of the word turn he suited the
action to the word by turning the horseshoe with the iron in his left
hand A slight grunt at the end of every stroke and the simultaneous
repetition of turn seemed to offer him amusement and relief Minty
without speaking crossed the shop and administered a sound box on her
brothers ear Take that and let me ketch you agen layin low when my
backs turned to put on your store pants

The others had fetched away in the laig said the boy opposing a knee
and elbow at acute angle to further attack

You jest get and change em said Minty

The sudden collapse of the bellows broke in upon the soothing refrain of
Mr Sharpe and caused him to turn also

Its Minty he said replacing the horseshoe on the coals and setting
his powerful arms and the sledge on the anvil with an exaggerated
expression of weariness

Yes its me said Minty and Creation knows its time I DID come to
keep that boy from ruinin us with his airs and conceits

Did ye bring over any o that fever mixter

No Bradley sez youre loading yerself up with so much o that bitter
barkkuinine they call it over therethat youll lift the ruff off
your head next He allows ye aint got no ague its jest wind and
dyspepsy He sez yers strong ez a hoss

Bradley said Sharpe laying aside his sledge with an aggrieved manner
which was however as complacent as his fatigue and discontent ez one
of them natral born finikin skunks ez I despise I reckon he began
to give pints to his parents when he was about kneehigh to Richelieu
there Hes on them confidential terms with hisself and the Almighty
that he reckons he ken run a sawmill and a mans insides at the same
time with one hand tied behind him And this finikin is up to his
conceit he wanted to tell me that that yer handy brush dump outside our
shanty was unhealthy Give a man with frills like that his own way and
hed be a sprinkling odor cologne and peppermint all over the country

He set your shoulder as well as any doctor said Minty

Thats bonesettin and a natral gift returned Sharpe as
triumphantly as his habitual depression would admit it aint conceit
and finikin got out o books Well he added after a pause wots
happened

Mintys face slightly changed Nothin I kem back to get some things
she said shortly moving away

And ye saw HIM

Yees drawled Minty carelessly still retreating

Bixby was along here about noon He says the stranger was suthin high
and mighty in his own country and them Frisco millionaires are quite
sweet on him Where are ye goin

In the house

Well look yer Minty Now that youre here ye might get up a batch
o hot biscuit for supper Dinner was that promiscous and experimental
today along o Richelieus natral foolin that I think I could git
outside of a little suthin now if only to prop up a kind of innard
sinkin that takes me Ye ken tell me the news at supper

Later however when Mr Sharpe had quitted his forge for the night and
seated at his domestic board was with a dismal presentiment of future
indigestion voraciously absorbing his favorite meal of hot saleratus
biscuits swimming in butter he had apparently forgotten his curiosity
concerning Mainwaring and settled himself to a complaining chronicle of
the days mishaps Natrally havin an extra lot o work on hand and
no time for foolin what does that ornery Richelieu get up and do this
mornin Ye know them ridiklus specimens that hes been chippin outer
that ledge that the yearth slipped from down the run and litterin up
the whole shanty with em Well darn my skin if he didnt run a heap
of em mixed up with coal unbeknowned to me in the forge to make
what he called a fire essay of em Natrally I couldnt get a
blessed iron hot and didnt know what had gone of the fire or the coal
either for two hours till I stopped work and raked out the coal That
comes from his hangin round that sawmill in the woods and listenin
to Bradleys highfalutin talk about rocks and strata and sich

But Bradley dont go a cent on minin Pop said Minty He sez the
woods is good enough for him and theres millions to be made when the
railroad comes along and timbers wanted

But until then hes got to keep hisself to pay wages and keep the
mill runnin Onless its ez Bixby says that he hopes to get that
Englishman to rope in some o them Frisco friends of his to take a
hand Ye didnt have any o that kind o talk did ye

No not THAT kind o talk said Minty

Not THAT kind o talk repeated her father with aggrieved curiosity
Wot kind then

Well said Minty lifting her black eyes to her fathers I aint
no account and you aint no account either You aint got no college
education aint got no friends in Frisco and aint got no hightoned
style I cant play the pianner jabber French nor get French dresses
We aint got no fancy Shallet as they call it with a firstclass
view of nothing but only a shanty on dry rock But afore ID take
advantage of a lazy gawky boyfor it aint anything else though hes
good meanin enoughthat happened to fall sick in MY house and coax
and cosset him and wrap him in white cotton and mother him and sister
him and Aunt Sukey him and almost drynuss him ginrally jist to get
him sweet on me and on mine and take the inside track of othersID be
an Injin And if youd allow it Pop youd be wuss nor a nigger

Sho said her father kindling with that intense gratification with
which the male receives any intimation of alien feminine weakness It
aint that Minty I wanter know

Its jist that Pop and I ez good ez let em know I seed it I aint a
fool if some folks do drop their eyes and pertend to wipe the laugh out
of their noses with a handkerchief when I let out to speak I maynt be
good enough kempany

Look yer Minty interrupted the blacksmith sternly half rising
from his seat with every trace of his former weakness vanished from his
hardset face do you mean to say that they put on airs to yeto MY
darter

No said Minty quickly the men didnt and dont you a man mix
yourself up with womens meannesses I ken manage em Pop with one
hand

Mr Sharpe looked at his daughters flashing black eyes Perhaps an
uneasy recollection of the late Mrs Sharpes remarkable capacity in
that respect checked his further rage

No Wot I was sayin resumed Minty ez that I maynt be thought by
others good enough to keep kempany with baronetts ez is to bethough
baronetts mightnt objectbut I aint mean enough to try to steal away
some ole womans darling boy in England or snatch some likely young
English girls big brother outer the family without sayin by your
leave Howd you like it if Richelieu was growed up and went to
seaand it would be like his peartnessand he fell sick in some
foreign land and some princess or other skyulged HIM underhand away
from us

Probably owing to the affair of the specimens the elder Sharpe did not
seem to regard the possible mesalliance of Richelieu with extraordinary
disfavor That boy is conceited enough with hair ile and fine clothes
for anything he said plaintively But didnt that Louise Macy hev a
feller alreadythat Captain Greyson Wots gone o him

Thats it said Minty he kin go out in the woods and whistle now
But all the same she could hitch him in again at any time if the other
stranger kicked over the traces Thats the style over there at The
Lookout There aint ez much heart in them two women put together ez
would make a green gal flush up playin forfeits Its all in their
breed Pop Love aint going to spile their appetites and complexions
give em nosebleed nor put a drop o water into their eyes in all
their natural born days Thats wot makes me mad Ef I thought that Loo
cared a bit for that child I wouldnt mind Id just advise her to make
him get up and getpack his duds out o camp and go home and not come
back until he had a written permit from his mother or the other baronet
in office

Looks sorter ef some one orter interfere said the blacksmith
reflectively Taint exackly a case for a vigilance committee tho
its agin public morals this sorter kidnappin o strangers Looks ez
if it might bring the country into discredit in England

Well dont YOU go and interfere and havin folks say ez my nose
was put out o jint over there said Minty curtly Theres another
Englishman comin up from Frisco to see him tomorrow Ef he aint
scooped up by Jenny Bradley hell guess theres a nigger in the fence
somewhere But there Pop let it drop Its a bad aig anyway she
concluded rising from the table and passing her hands down her frock
and her shapely hips as if to wipe off further contamination of the
subject Wheres Richelieu agin

Said he didnt want supper and like ez not hes gone over to see that
fammerly at the Summit Theres a little girl thar hes sparkin about
his own age

His own age said Minty indignantly Why shes double that if
shes a day Wellif he aint the triflinest conceitednest little limb
that ever grew Id like to know where he got it fromit wasnt mars
style

Mr Sharpe smiled darkly Richelieus precocious gallantry evidently was
not considered as gratuitous as his experimental metallurgy But as his
eyes followed his daughters wholesome Phyllislike figure a new idea
took possession of him needless to say however it was in the line
of another personal aggrievement albeit it took the form of religious
reflection

Its curous Minty wots foreordained and wot aint Now yers one
of them high and mighty fellows after the Lord ez comes meanderin
around here and drops offez fur ez I kin hearin a kind o faint at
the first house he kems to and is taken in and lodged and sumptuously
fed and natrally they gets their reward for it Now wots to hev
kept that young feller from coming HERE and droppin down in my forge
or in this very room and YOU a tendin him and jist layin over them
folks at The Lookout

Wots got hold o ye Pop Dont I tell ye he had a letter to Jim
Bradley said Minty quickly with an angry flash of color in her
cheek

That aint it said Sharpe confidently its cos he WALKED
Natrally youd think hed RIDE being high and mighty and thats
where ez the parson will tell ye wots merely finite and human wisdom
errs Ef that feller had ridden hed have had to come by this yer
road and by this yer forge and stop a spell like any other But it
was foreordained that he should walk jest cos it wasnt generally
kalkilated and reckoned on So YOU had no show

For a moment Minty seemed struck with her fathers original theory
But with a vigorous shake of her shoulders she threw it off Her eyes
darkened

I reckon you aint thinking Pop she began

I was only sayin it was curous he rejoined quietly Nevertheless
after a pause he rose coughed and going up to the young girl as she
leaned over the dresser bent his powerful arm around her and drawing
her and the plate she was holding against his breast laid his bearded
cheek for an instant softly upon her rebellious head Its all right
Minty he said aint it pet Mintys eyelids closed gently under
the familiar pressure Wots that in your hair Minty he said
tactfully breaking an embarrassing pause

Bars grease father murmured Minty in a childs voicethe grownup
woman under that magic touch having lapsed again into her fathers
motherless charge of ten years before

Its powful soothin and pretty said her father

I made it myselfdo you want some asked Minty

Not now girl For a moment they slightly rocked each other in that
attitudethe man dexterously the woman with infinite tendernessand
then they separated

Late that night after Richelieu had returned and her father wrestled
in his fitful sleep with the remorse of his guilty indulgence at supper
Minty remained alone in her room hard at work surrounded by the
contents of one of her mothers trunks and the fragments of certain
rippedup and newlyturned dresses For Minty had conceived the bold
idea of altering one of her mothers gowns to the fashion of a certain
fascinating frock worn by Louise Macy It was late when her selfimposed
task was completed With a nervous trepidation that was novel to
her Minty began to disrobe herself preparatory to trying on her new
creation The light of a tallow candle and a large swinging lantern
borrowed from her fathers forge fell shyly on her milky neck and
shoulders and shone in her sparkling eyes as she stood before her
largest mirrorthe long glazed door of a kitchen clock which she had
placed upon her chest of drawers Had poor Minty been content with the
full free and goddesslike outlines that it reflected she would have
been spared her impending disappointment For alas the dress of her
model had been framed upon a symmetrically attenuated French corset and
the unfortunate Mintys fuller and ampler curves had under her simple
country stays known no more restraining cincture than knew the Venus
of Milo The alteration was a hideous failure it was neither Mintys
statuesque outline nor Louise Macys graceful contour Minty was no
fool and the revelation of this slow education of the figure and
training of outlinewhether fair or false in artstruck her quick
intelligence with all its full and hopeless significance A bitter light
sprang to her eyes she tore the wretched sham from her shoulders and
then wrapping a shawl around her threw herself heavily and sullenly on
the bed But inaction was not a characteristic of Mintys emotion she
presently rose again and taking an old workbox from her trunk began
to rummage in its recesses It was an old shellincrusted affair and
the apparent receptacle of such cheap odds and ends of jewelry as she
possessed a hideous cameo ring the property of the late Mrs Sharpe
was missing She again rapidly explored the contents of the box and
then an inspiration seized her and she darted into her brothers
bedroom

That precocious and gallant Lovelace of ten despite all sentiment had
basely succumbed to the gross materialism of youthful slumber On a
cot in the corner half hidden under the wreck of his own careless and
hurried disrobing with one arm hanging out of the coverlid Richelieu
lay supremely unconscious On the forefinger of his small but dirty hand
the missing cameo was still glittering guiltily With a swift movement
of indignation Minty rushed with uplifted palm towards the tempting
expanse of youthful cheek that lay invitingly exposed upon the pillow
Then she stopped suddenly

She had seen him lying thus a hundred times before On the pillow near
him an indistinguishable mass of golden furthe helpless bulk of a
squirrel chained to the leg of his cot at his feet a walleyed cat who
had followed his tyrannous caprices with the longsuffering devotion
of her sex on the shelf above him a loathsome collection of flies
and tarantulas in dull green bottles a slab of gingerbread for light
nocturnal refection and her own pot of bears grease Perhaps it was
the piteous defencelessness of youthful sleep perhaps it was some
lingering memory of her fathers caress but as she gazed at him with
troubled eyes the juvenile reprobate slipped back into the babyboy
that she had carried in her own childish arms such a short time ago
when the maternal responsibility had descended with the dead mothers
illfitting dresses upon her lank girlish figure and scant virgin
breastand her hand fell listlessly at her side

The sleeper stirred slightly and awoke At the same moment by some
mysterious sympathy a pair of beady bright eyes appeared in the bulk
of fur near his curls the cat stretched herself and even a vague
agitation was heard in the bottles on the shelf Richelieus blinking
eyes wandered from the candle to his sister and then the guilty hand
was suddenly withdrawn under the bedclothes

No matter dear said Minty its mars and you kin wear it when you
like if youll only ask for it

Richelieu wondered if he was dreaming This unexpected mildnessthis
inexplicable tremor in his sisters voice it must be some occult
influence of the night season on the sisterly mind possibly akin to a
fear of ghosts He made a mental note of it in view of future favors
yet for the moment he felt embarrassedly gratified Ye aint wantin
anything Minty he said affectionately a pail o cold water from the
far springno nothin He made an ostentatious movement as if to
rise yet sufficiently protracted to prevent any hasty acceptance of his
prodigal offer

No dear she said still gazing at him with an absorbed look in her
dark eyes

Richelieu felt a slight creepy sensation under that lonely faroff gaze
Your eyes look awful big at night Minty he said He would have added
and pretty but she was his sister and he had the lofty fraternal
conviction of his duty in repressing the inordinate vanity of the sex
Yere sure ye aint wantin nothin

Not now dear She paused a moment and then said deliberately But
you wouldnt mind turnin out after sunup and runnin an errand for me
over to The Lookout

Richelieus eyes sparkled so suddenly that even in her absorption
Minty noticed the change But yere not goin to tarry over there ner
gossipyou hear Yer to take this yer message Yer to say that it will
be onpossible for me to come back there on accounton account of

Important business suggested Richelieu thats the perlite style

Ef you like She leaned over the bed and put her lips to his forehead
still damp with the dews of sleep and then to his longlashed lids
Mind Nipthe squirrelhe practically suggested For an instant
their blond curls mingled on the pillow Now go to sleep she said
curtly

But Richelieu had taken her white neck in the short strangulatory hug of
the small boy and held her fast Yell let me put on my best pants

Yes

And wear that ring

Yesa little sadly

Then yer kin count me in Minty and see herehis voice sank to a
confidential whispermebbee some day yell be beholden to ME for a lot
o real jewelry

She returned slowly to her room and opening the window looked out
upon the night The same moon that had lent such supererogatory grace to
the natural beauty of The Lookout here seemed to have failed as Minty
had in disguising the relentless limitations of Nature or the cruel
bonds of custom The black plain of granite under its rays appeared
only to extend its poverty to some remoter barrier the blackened stumps
of the burnt forest stood bleaker against the sky like broken and
twisted pillars of iron The cavity of the broken ledge where Richelieu
had prospected was a hideous chasm of bluish blackness over which a
purple vapor seemed to hover the brush dump beside the house showed
a cavern of writhing and distorted objects stiffened into dark rigidity
She had often looked upon the prospect it had never seemed so hard and
changeless yet she accepted it as she had accepted it before

She turned away undressed herself mechanically and went to bed She
had an idea that she had been very foolish that her escape from
being still more foolish was something miraculous and in some measure
connected with Providence her father her little brother and her dead
mother whose dress she had recklessly spoiled But that she had even so
slightly touched the bitterness and glory of renunciationas written
of heroines and fine ladies by novelists and poetsnever entered the
foolish head of Minty Sharpe the blacksmiths daughter




CHAPER IV


It was a little after daybreak next morning that Mainwaring awoke from
the first unrefreshing night he had passed at The Lookout He was so
feverish and restless that he dressed himself at sunrise and cautiously
stepped out upon the still silent veranda The chairs which he and
Louise Macy had occupied were still it seemed to him conspicuously
confidential with each other and he separated them but as he looked
down into the Great Canyon at his feet he was conscious of some
undefinable change in the prospect A slight mist was rising from the
valley as if it were the last of last nights illusions the first
level sunbeams were obtrusively searching and the keen morning air had
a dryly practical insistence which irritated him until a light footstep
on the farther end of the veranda caused him to turn sharply

It was the singular apparition of a small boy bearing a surprising
resemblance to Minty Sharpe and dressed in an unique fashion On a
tumbled sea of blond curls a chip sailor hat with a broad red ribbon
rode jauntily But here the nautical suggestion changed as had the
desire of becoming a pirate which induced it A red shirt with a white
collar and a yellow plaid ribbon tie that also recalled Minty Sharpe
lightly turned the suggestion of his costume to mining Short black
velvet trousers coming to his knee and ostentatiously new shortlegged
boots with visible straps like curling ears completed the entirely
original character of his lower limbs

Mainwaring always easily gentle and familiar with children and his
inferiors looked at him with an encouraging smile Richelieufor it
was headvanced gravely and held out his hand with the cameo ring
apparent Mainwaring with equal gravity shook it warmly and removed
his hat Richelieu keenly observant did the same

Is Jim Bradley out yet asked Richelieu carelessly

No I think not But Im Frank Mainwaring Will I do

Richelieu smiled The dimples the white teeth the dark laughing eyes
were surely Mintys

Im Richelieu he rejoined with equal candor

Richelieu

Yes That Frenchmanthe Lord Cardinalyou know Mar saw Forrest do
him out in St Louis

Do him

Yes in the theayter

With a confused misconception of his meaning Mainwaring tried to
recall the historical dress of the great Cardinal and fit it to the
masqueraderif such he werebefore him But Richelieu relieved him by
adding

Richelieu Sharpe

Oh thats your NAME said Mainwaring cheerfully Then youre Miss
Mintys brother I know her How jolly lucky

They both shook hands again Richelieu eager to get rid of the burden
of his sisters message which he felt was in the way of freeandeasy
intercourse with this charming stranger looked uneasily towards the
house

I say said Mainwaring if youre in a hurry youd better go in
there and knock I hear some one stirring in the kitchen

Richelieu nodded but first went back to the steps of the veranda
picked up a small blue knotted handkerchief apparently containing some
heavy objects and repassed Mainwaring

What have you cut it Richelieu with your valuables What have you
got there

Specimins said Richelieu shortly and vanished

He returned presently Well Cardinal did you see anybody asked
Mainwaring

Mrs Bradley but Jims over to the mill Im goin there

Did you see Miss Macy continued Mainwaring carelessly

Loo

Loowell yes

No Shes philanderin with Captain Greyson

Philandering with Greyson echoed Mainwaring in wonder

Yes on horseback on the ridge

You mean shes riding out with Mrwith Captain Greyson

Yes ridin AND philanderin persisted Richelieu

And what do you call philandering

Well I reckon you and she oughter know returned Richelieu with a
precocious air

Certainly said Mainwaring with a faint smile Richelieu really was
like Minty

There was a long silence This young Englishman was becoming exceedingly
uninteresting Richelieu felt that he was gaining neither profit nor
amusement and losing time Im going he said

Good morning said Mainwaring without looking up

Richelieu picked up his specimens thoroughly convinced of the
strangers glittering deceitfulness and vanished

It was nearly eight oclock when Mrs Bradley came from the house She
apologized with a slightly distrait smile for the tardiness of the
household Mr Bradley stayed at the mill all night and will not be
here until breakfast when he brings your friend Mr Richardson with
himMainwaring scarcely repressed a movement of impatiencewho
arrives early Its unfortunate that Miss Sharpe cant come today

In his abstraction Mainwaring did not notice that Mrs Bradley slightly
accented Mintys formal appellation and said carelessly

Oh thats why her brother came over here so early

Did YOU see him asked Mrs Bradley almost abruptly

Yes He is an amusing little beggar but I think he shares his sisters
preference for Mr Bradley He deserted me here in the veranda for him
at the mill

Louise will keep you company as soon as she has changed her dress
continued Mrs Bradley She was out riding early this morning with a
friend Shes very fond of early morning rides

AND philandering repeated Mainwaring to himself It was quite natural
for Miss Macy to ride out in the morning after the fashion of
the country with an escort but why had the cub insisted on the
philandering He had said AND philandering distinctly It was a
nasty thing for him to say Any other fellow but he Mainwaring might
misunderstand the whole thing Perhaps he ought to warn herbut no he
could not repeat the gossip of a child and that child the brother of
one of her inferiors But was Minty an inferior Did she and Minty talk
together about this fellow Greyson At all events it would only revive
the awkwardness of the preceding day and he resolved to say nothing

He was rewarded by a halfinquiring halfconfiding look in Louises
bright eyes when she presently greeted him on the veranda She had
quite forgotten she said to tell him last night of her mornings
engagement indeed she had half forgotten IT It used to be a favorite
practice of hers with Captain Greyson but she had lately given it up
She believed she had not ridden sincesince

Since when asked Mainwaring

Well since you were ill she said frankly

A quick pleasure shone in Mainwarings cheek and eye but Louises
pretty lids did not drop nor her faint quiet bloom deepen Breakfast
was already waiting when Mr Richardson arrived alone

He explained that Mr Bradley had some important and unexpected business
which had delayed him but which he added Mr Bradley says may
prove interesting enough to you to excuse his absence this morning
Mainwaring was not displeased that his critical and observant host was
not present at their meeting Louise Macy was however as demurely
conscious of the different bearing of the two compatriots Richardsons
somewhat selfimportant patronage of the two ladies and that
Californian familiarity he had acquired changed to a certain uneasy
deference towards Mainwaring while the younger Englishmans slightly
stiff and deliberate cordiality was nevertheless mingled with a
mysterious understanding that appeared innate and unconscious Louise
was quick to see that these two men more widely divergent in quality
than any two of her own countrymen were yet more subtly connected
by some unknown sympathy than the most equal of Americans Mintys
prophetic belief of the effect of the two women upon Richardson was
certainly true as regarded Mrs Bradley The bankera large material
naturewas quickly fascinated by the demure puritanic graces of that
lady and was inclined to exhibit a somewhat broad and ostentatious
gallantry that annoyed Mainwaring When they were seated alone on
the veranda which the ladies had discreetly left to them Richardson
said

Odd I didnt hear of Bradleys wife before She seems a spicy pretty
comfortable creature Regularly thrown away with him up here

Mainwaring replied coldly that she was an admirable helpmeet of a very
admirable man not however without an uneasy recollection of her
previous confidences respecting her husband They have been most
thoroughly good and kind to me my own brother and sister could not have
done more And certainly not with better taste or delicacy he added
markedly

Certainly certainly said Richardson hurriedly I wrote to Lady
Mainwaring that you were taken capital care of by some very honest
people and that

Lady Mainwaring already knows what I think of them and what she owes
to their kindness said Mainwaring dryly

True true said Richardson apologetically Of course you must have
seen a good deal of them I only know Bradley in a business way Hes
been trying to get the Bank to help him to put up some new mills here
but we didnt see it I dare say he is good companyrather amusing
eh

Mainwaring had the gift of his class of snubbing by the polite and
forgiving oblivion of silence Richardson shifted uneasily in his chair
but continued with assumed carelessness

No I only knew of this cousin Miss Macy I heard of her when she
was visiting some friends in Menlo Park last year Rather an attractive
girl They say Colonel Johnson of Sacramento took quite a fancy
to herit would have been a good match I dare say for he is very
richbut the thing fell through in some way Then they say SHE wanted
to marry that Spaniard young Pico of the Amador Ranche but his family
wouldnt hear of it Somehow shes deuced unlucky I suppose shell
make a mess of it with Captain Greyson she was out riding with this
morning

Didnt the Bank think Bradleys mills a good investment asked
Mainwaring quietly when Richardson paused

Not with him in it he is not a business man you know

I thought he was He seems to me an energetic man who knows his work
and is not afraid to look after it himself

Thats just it He has got absurd ideas of cooperating with his
workmen you know and doing everything slowly and on a limited scale
The only thing to be done is to buy up all the land on this ridge run
off the settlers freeze out all the other mills and put it into a big
San Francisco company on shares Thats the only way we would look at
it

But you dont consider the investment bad even from HIS point of
view

Perhaps not

And you only decline it because it isnt big enough for the Bank

Exactly

Richardson said Mainwaring slowly rising putting his hands in his
trousers pockets and suddenly looking down upon the banker from the
easy level of habitual superiority I wish youd attend to this thing
for me I desire to make some return to Mr Bradley for his kindness I
wish to give him what help he wantsin his own wayyou understand I
wish it and I believe my father wishes it too If youd like him to
write to you to that effect

By no means its not at all necessary said Richardson dropping with
equal suddenness into his oldworld obsequiousness I shall certainly
do as you wish It is not a bad investment Mr Mainwaring and as you
suggest a very proper return for their kindness And being here it
will come quite naturally for me to take up the affair again

AndI say Richardson

Yes sir

As these ladies are rather shorthanded in their domestic service you
know perhaps youd better not stay to luncheon or dinner but go on to
the Summit Houseits only a mile or two fartherand come back here
this evening I shant want you until then

Certainly stammered Richardson Ill just take leave of the ladies

Its not at all necessary said Mainwaring quietly you would only
disturb them in their household duties Ill tell them what Ive done
with you if they ask Youll find your stick and hat in the passage
and you can leave the veranda by these steps By the way you had better
manage at the Summit to get some one to bring my traps from here to be
forwarded to Sacramento tomorrow Ill want a conveyance or a horse
of some kind myself for Ive given up walking for a while but we can
settle about that tonight Come early Good morning

He accompanied his thoroughly subjugated countrymanwho however far
from attempting to reassert himself actually seemed easier and more
cheerful in his submissionto the end of the veranda and watched
him depart As he turned back he saw the pretty figure of Louise Macy
leaning against the doorway How graceful and refined she looked in that
simple morning dress What wonder that she was admired by Greyson by
Johnson and by that Spaniardno by Jove it was SHE that wanted to
marry him

What have you sent away Mr Richardson for asked the young girl with
a halfreproachful halfmischievous look in her bright eyes

I packed him off because I thought it was a little too hard on you and
Mrs Bradley to entertain him without help

But as he was OUR guest you might have left that to us said Miss
Macy

By Jove I never thought of that said Mainwaring coloring in
consternation Pray forgive me Miss Macybut you see I knew the man
and could say it and you couldnt

Well I forgive you for you look really so cut up said Louise
laughing But I dont know what Jenny will say of your disposing of her
conquest so summarily She stopped and regarded him more attentively
Has he brought you any bad news if so its a pity you didnt send him
away before Hes quite spoiling our cure

Mainwaring thought bitterly that he had But its a cure for all that
Miss Macy he said with an attempt at cheerfulness and being a cure
you see theres no longer an excuse for my staying here I have been
making arrangements for leaving here tomorrow

So soon

Do you think it soon Miss Macy asked Mainwaring turning pale in
spite of himself

I quite forgotthat you were here as an invalid only and that we owe
our pleasure to the accident of your pain

She spoke a little artificially he thought yet her cheeks had not lost
their pink bloom nor her eyes their tranquillity Had he heard Mintys
criticism he might have believed that the organic omission noticed by
her was a fact

And now that your good work as Sister of Charity is completed youll
be able to enter the world of gayety again with a clear conscience
said Mainwaring with a smile that he inwardly felt was a miserable
failure Youll be able to resume your morning rides you know which
the wretched invalid interrupted

Louise raised her clear eyes to his without reproach indignation or
even wonder He felt as if he had attempted an insult and failed

Does my cousin know you are going so soon she asked finally

No I did not know myself until today You see he added hastily
while his honest blood blazoned the lie in his cheek Ive heard of
some miserable business affairs that will bring me back to England
sooner that I expected

I think you should consider your health more important than any mere
business said Louise I dont mean that you should remain HERE she
added with a hasty laugh but it would be a pity now that you have
reaped the benefit of rest and taking care of yourself that you should
not make it your only business to seek it elsewhere

Mainwaring longed to say that within the last half hour living or dying
had become of little moment to him but he doubted the truth or efficacy
of this timeworn heroic of passion He felt too that anything he said
was a mere subterfuge for the real reason of his sudden departure And
how was he to question her as to that reason In escaping from these
subterfugeshe was compelled to lie again With an assumption of
changing the subject he said calmly Richardson thought he had met you
beforein Menlo Park I think

Amazed at the evident irrelevance of the remark Louise said coldly
that she did not remember having seen him before

I think it was at a Mr Johnsonsor WITH a Mr Johnsonor perhaps at
one of those Spanish ranchesI think he mentioned some name like Pico

Louise looked at him wonderingly for an instant and then gave way to
a frank irrepressible laugh which lent her delicate but rather set
little face all the color he had missed Partially relieved by her
unconcern and yet mortified that he had only provoked her sense of the
ludicrous he tried to laugh also

Then to be quite plain said Louise wiping her now humid eyes you
want me to understand that you really didnt pay sufficient attention
to hear correctly Thank you thats a pretty English compliment I
suppose

I dare say you wouldnt call it philandering

I certainly shouldnt for I dont know what philandering means

Mainwaring could not reply with Richelieu You ought to know nor did
he dare explain what he thought it meant and how he knew it Louise
however innocently solved the difficulty

Theres a country song Ive heard Minty sing she said It runs

 Come Philander let us be amarchin
 Every one for his true love asarchin
 Choose your true love now or never   

Have you been listening to her also

No said Mainwaring with a sudden incomprehensible but utterly
irrepressible resolution but IM amarchin you know and perhaps
I must choose my true love now or never Will you help me Miss Macy

He drew gently near her He had become quite white but also very manly
and it struck her more deeply thoroughly and conscientiously sincere
than any man who had before addressed her She moved slightly away as
if to rest herself by laying both hands upon the back of the chair

Where do you expect to begin your sarchin she said leaning on
the chair and tilting it before her or are you as vague as usual as to
locality Is it at some Mr Johnson or Mr Pico or

Here he interrupted boldly

I really think you ought to first tell my cousin that you are going
away tomorrow she said with a faint smile Its such short notice
Shes just in there She nodded her pretty head without raising her
eyes towards the hall

But it may not be so soon said Mainwaring

Oh then the sarchin is not so important said Louise raising
her head and looking towards the hall with some uneasy but indefinable
feminine instinct

She was right the sittingroom door opened and Mrs Bradley made her
smiling appearance

Mr Mainwaring was just looking for you said Louise for the first
time raising her eyes to him Hes not only sent off Mr Richardson
but hes going away himself tomorrow

Mrs Bradley looked from the one to the other in mute wonder Mainwaring
cast an imploring glance at Louise which had the desired effect Much
more seriously and in a quaint businesslike way the young girl took
it upon herself to explain to Mrs Bradley that Richardson had brought
the invalid some important news that would unfortunately not only
shorten his stay in America but even compel him to leave The Lookout
sooner than he expected perhaps tomorrow Mainwaring thanked her with
his eyes and then turned to Mrs Bradley

Whether I go tomorrow or next day he said with simple and earnest
directness I intend you know to see you soon again either here or
in my own home in England I do not know he added with marked gravity
that I have succeeded in convincing you that I have made your family
already well known to my people and thathe fixed his eyes with a
meaning look on Louiseno matter when or in what way you come to
them your place is made ready for you You may not like them you know
the governor is getting to be an old manperhaps too old for young
Americansbut THEY will like YOU and you must put up with that My
mother and sisters know Miss Macy as well as I do and will make her one
of the family

The conscientious earnestness with which these apparent
conventionalities were uttered and some occult quality of quiet
conviction in the young mans manner brought a pleasant sparkle to the
eyes of Mrs Bradley and Louise

But said Mrs Bradley gayly our going to England is quite beyond
our present wildest dreams nothing but a windfall an unexpected
rise in timber or even the tabooed hotel speculation could make it
possible

But I shall take the liberty of trying to present it to Mr Bradley
tonight in some practical way that may convince even his critical
judgment said Mainwaring still seriously It will be he added more
lightly the famous testimonial of my cure which I promised you

And you will find Mr Bradley so sceptical that you will be obliged to
defer your going said Mrs Bradley triumphantly Come Louise we
must not forget that we have still Mr Mainwarings present comfort to
look after that Minty has basely deserted us and that we ourselves
must see that the last days of our guest beneath our roof are not
remembered for their privation

She led Louise away with a halfmischievous suggestion of maternal
propriety and left Mainwaring once more alone on the veranda

He had done it Certainly she must have understood his meaning and
there was nothing left for him to do but to acquaint Bradley with his
intentions tonight and press her for a final answer in the morning
There would be no indelicacy then in asking her for an interview more
free from interruption than this public veranda Without conceit he
did not doubt what the answer would be His indecision his sudden
resolution to leave her had been all based upon the uncertainty of HIS
own feelings the propriety of HIS declaration the possibility of some
previous experience of hers that might compromise HIM Convinced by
her unembarrassed manner of her innocence or rather satisfied of her
indifference to Richardsons gossip he had been hurried by his feelings
into an unexpected avowal Brought up in the perfect security of his
own social position and familiarly consciouswithout vanityof
its importance and power in such a situation he believed without
undervaluing Louises charms or independence that he had no one else
than himself to consult Even the slight uneasiness that still pursued
him was more due to his habitual conscientiousness of his own intention
than to any fear that she would not fully respond to it Indeed with
his conservative ideas of proper feminine selfrestraint Louises calm
passivity and undemonstrative attitude were a proof of her superiority
had she blushed overmuch cried or thrown herself into his arms he
would have doubted the wisdom of so easy a selection It was true he had
known her scarcely three weeks if he chose to be content with that his
own accessible record of three centuries should be sufficient for her
and condone any irregularity

Nevertheless as an hour slipped away and Louise did not make her
appearance either on the veranda or in the little sittingroom off the
hall Mainwaring became more uneasy as to the incompleteness of their
interview Perhaps a faint suspicion of the inadequacy of her response
began to trouble him but he still fatuously regarded it rather as
owing to his own hurried and unfinished declaration It was true that
he hadnt said half what he intended to say it was true that she might
have misunderstood it as the conventional gallantry of the situation
asterrible thoughtthe light banter of the habitual lovemaking
American to which she had been accustomed perhaps even now she
relegated him to the level of Greyson and this accounted for her
singular impassivenessan impassiveness that certainly was singular
now he reflected upon itthat might have been even contempt The last
thought pricked his deep conscientiousness he walked hurriedly up and
down the veranda and then suddenly reentering his room took up a
sheet of notepaper and began to write to her


Can you grant me a few moments interview alone I cannot bear you
should think that what I was trying to tell you when we were interrupted
was prompted by anything but the deepest sincerity and conviction
or that I am willing it should be passed over lightly by you or be
forgotten Pray give me a chance of proving it by saying you will see
me F M


But how should he convey this to her His delicacy revolted against
handing it to her behind Mrs Bradleys back or the prestidigitation of
slipping it into her lap or under her plate before them at luncheon he
thought for an instant of the Chinaman but gentlemenexcept in that
mirror of nature the stageusually hesitate to suborn other peoples
servants or entrust a womans secret to her inferiors He remembered
that Louises room was at the farther end of the house and its low
window gave upon the veranda and was guarded at night by a film of
white and blue curtains that were parted during the day to allow
a triangular revelation of a pale blue and white draped interior
Mainwaring reflected that the low inside window ledge was easily
accessible from the veranda would afford a capital lodgment for the
note and be quickly seen by the fair occupant of the room on entering
He sauntered slowly past the window the room was empty the moment
propitious A slight breeze was stirring the blue ribbons of the
curtain it would be necessary to secure the note with something he
returned along the veranda to the steps where he had noticed a small
irregular stone lying which had evidently escaped from Richelieus bag
of treasure specimens and had been overlooked by that ingenuous child
It was of a pretty peacockblue color and besides securing a paper
would be sure to attract her attention He placed his note on the inside
ledge and the blue stone atop and went away with a sense of relief

Another half hour passed without incident He could hear the voices
of the two women in the kitchen and diningroom After a while they
appeared to cease and he heard the sound of an opening door It
then occurred to him that the veranda was still too exposed for a
confidential interview and he resolved to descend the steps pass
before the windows of the kitchen where Louise might see him and
penetrate the shrubbery where she might be induced to follow him They
would not be interrupted nor overheard there

But he had barely left the veranda before the figure of Richelieu
who had been patiently waiting for Mainwarings disappearance emerged
stealthily from the shrubbery He had discovered his loss on handing his
fire assays to the goodhumored Bradley for later examination and he
had retraced his way step by step looking everywhere for his missing
stone with the unbounded hopefulness lazy persistency and lofty
disregard for time and occupation known only to the genuine boy
He remembered to have placed his knotted bag upon the veranda and
slipping off his stiff boots slowly and softly slid along against the
wall of the house looking carefully on the floor and yet preserving
a studied negligence of demeanor with one hand in his pocket and his
small mouth contracted into a singularly soothing and almost voiceless
whistleRichelieus own peculiar accomplishment But no stone appeared
Like most of his genus he was superstitious and repeated to himself the
cabalistic formula Losins seekins findins keepinspresumed
to be of great efficacy in such caseswith religious fervor He had
laboriously reached the end of the veranda when he noticed the open
window of Louises room and stopped as a perfunctory duty to look in
And then Richelieu Sharpe stood for an instant utterly confounded and
aghast at this crowning proof of the absolute infamy and sickening
enormity of Man

There was HIS stoneHIS RICHELIEUS OWN SPECIMEN carefully gathered
by himself and none otherand now stolen abstracted skyugled
smouged hooked by this rotten skunkified longlegged
splayfooted hosslaughin niggertoothed ornary despot And
worse than all actually made to do infamous duty as a love tokena
candygifta philanderin box to HIS Richelieus girlfor
Louise belonged to that innocent and vague outside seraglio of
Richelieus boyish dreamsand put atop of a letter to her and
Providence permitted such an outrage Wot was he Richelieu sent to
school for and organized wickedness in the shape of gorilla Injins like
this allowed to ride high horses rampant over Californey He looked
at the heavens in mute appeal And thenProvidence not immediately
interferinghe thrust his own small arm into the window regained his
priceless treasure and fled swiftly

A fateful silence ensued The wind slightly moved the curtain outward
as if in a playful attempt to follow him and then subsided A moment
later apparently reenforced by other winds or sympathizing with
Richelieu it lightly lifted the unlucky missive and cast it softly from
the window But here another wind lying in wait caught it cleverly
and tossed it in a long curve into the abyss For an instant it seemed
to float lazily as on the mirrored surface of a lake until turning
upon its side it suddenly darted into utter oblivion

When Mainwaring returned from the shrubbery he went softly to the
window The disappearance of the letter and stone satisfied him of the
success of his stratagem and for the space of three hours relieved his
anxiety But at the end of that time finding no response from Louise
his former uneasiness returned Was she offended orthe first doubt of
her acceptance of him crossed his mind

A sudden and inexplicable sense of shame came upon him At the same
moment he heard his name called from the steps turnedand beheld
Minty

Her dark eyes were shining with a pleasant light and her lips parted on
her white teeth with a frank happy smile She advanced and held out her
hand He took it with a mingling of disappointment and embarrassment

Youre wondering why I kem on here arter I sent word this morning that
I kelkilated not to come Well twixt then and now suthin s happened
Weve had fine doins over at our house you bet Pop dont know which
end hes standin on and I reckon that for about ten minutes I didnt
know my own name But ez soon ez I got fairly hold o the hull thing
and had it put straight in my mind I sez to myself Minty Sharpe sez
I the first thing for you to do now is to put on yer bonnet and shawl
and trapse over to Jim Bradleys and help them two womenfolks get dinner
for themselves and that sick stranger And continued Minty throwing
herself into a chair and fanning her glowing face with her apron yer I
am

But you have not told me WHAT has happened said Mainwaring with a
constrained smile and an uneasy glance towards the house

Thats so said Minty with a brilliant laugh I clean forgot the
hull gist of the thing Well were rich folks nowover thar on Barren
Ledge That onery brother of mine Richelieu hez taken some of his
specimens over to Jim Bradley to be tested And Bradley just to please
that child takes em and not an hour ago Bradley comes running likety
switch over to Pop to tell him to put up his notices for the hull of
that ledge where the forge stands is a mine o silver and copper Afore
ye knew it Lordy half the folks outer the Summit and the mill was
scattered down thar all over it Richardsonthat stranger ez knows
youkem thar too with Jim and he allows ef Bradleys essay is right
its worth more than a hundred thousand dollars ez it stands

I suppose I must congratulate you Miss Sharpe said Mainwaring with
an attempt at interest but his attention still preoccupied with the
open doorway

Oh THEY know all about it said Minty following the direction of his
abstracted eyes with a slight darkening of her own I jest kem out o
the kitchen the other way and Jim sent em a note but I allowed Id
tell YOU myself Specially ez you are going away tomorrow

Who said I was going away tomorrow asked Mainwaring uneasily

Loo Macy

Ahshe did But I may change my mind you know he continued with a
faint smile

Minty shook her curls decisively I reckon SHE knows she said dryly
shes got law and gospel for wot she says But yer she comes Ask her
Look yer Loo she added as the two women appeared at the doorway
with a certain exaggeration of congratulatory manner that struck
Mainwaring as being as artificial and disturbed as his own didnt Sir
Francis yer say he was going tomorrow

Thats what I understood returned Louise with cold astonishment
letting her clear indifferent eyes fall upon Mainwaring I do not know
that he has changed his mind

Unless as Miss Sharpe is a great capitalist now she is willing to use
her powers of persuasion added Mrs Bradley with a slight acidulous
pointing of her usual prim playfulness

I reckon Minty Sharpes the same ez she allus wos unless more so
returned Minty with an honest egotism that carried so much conviction
to the hearer as to condone its vanity But I kem yer to do a days
work gals and I allow to pitch in and do it and not sit yer swoppin
compliments and keeping HIM from packin his duds Onless she stopped
and looked around at the uneasy unsympathetic circle with a faint
tremulousness of lip that belied the brave black eyes above it onless
Im in yer way

The two women sprang forward with a feminine bewildering excess of
protestation and Mainwaring suddenly pierced through his outer selfish
embarrassment to his more honest depths stammered quickly

Look here Miss Sharpe if you think of running away again after
having come all the way here to make us share the knowledge of your good
fortune and your better heart by Jove Ill go back with you

But here the two women effusively hurried her away from the dangerous
proximity of such sympathetic honesty and a moment later Mainwaring
heard her laughing voice as of old ringing in the kitchen And then
as if unconsciously responding to the significant common sense that lay
in her last allusion to him he went to his room and grimly began his
packing

He did not again see Louise alone At their informal luncheon the
conversation turned upon the more absorbing topic of the Sharpes
discovery its extent and its probable effect upon the fortunes of
the locality He noticed abstractedly that both Mrs Bradley and her
cousin showed a real or assumed scepticism of its value This did
not disturb him greatly except for its intended check upon Mintys
enthusiasm He was more conscious perhapswith a faint touch of
mortified vanitythat his own contemplated departure was of lesser
importance than this local excitement Yet in his growing conviction
that all was overif indeed it had ever begunbetween himself and
Louise he was grateful to this natural diversion of incident which
spared them both an interval of embarrassing commonplaces And with
the suspicion of some indefinable insincerityeither of his own or
Louiseshaunting him Mintys frank heartiness and outspoken loyalty
gave him a strange relief It seemed to him as if the clear cool breath
of the forest had entered with her homely garments and the steadfast
truth of Nature were incarnate in her shining eyes How far this poetic
fancy would have been consistent or even coexistent with any gleam of
tenderness or selfforgetfulness in Louises equally pretty orbs I
leave the satirical feminine reader to determine

It was late when Bradley at last returned bringing further and more
complete corroboration of the truth of Sharpes good fortune Two
experts had arrived one from Pine Flat and another from the Summit and
upon this statement Richardson had offered to purchase an interest in
the discovery that would at once enable the blacksmith to develop his
mine I shouldnt wonder Mainwaring he added cheerfully if hed
put you into it too and make your eternal fortune

With larks falling from the skies all round you its a pity YOU
couldnt get put into something said Mrs Bradley straightening her
pretty brows

Im not a goldminer my dear said Bradley pleasantly

Nor a goldfinder returned his wife with a cruel little depression
of her pink nostrils but you can work all night in that stupid mill
and then she added in a low voice to escape Mintys attention spend
the whole of the next day examining and following up a boys discovery
that his own relations had been too lazy and too ignorant to understand
and profit by I suppose that next you will be hunting up a site on the
OTHER SIDE of the Canyon where somebody else can put up a hotel and
ruin your own prospects

A sensitive shadow of pain quickly dimmed Bradleys glancenot the
first or last time evidently for it was gradually bringing out a
background of sadness in his intelligent eyes But the next moment he
turned kindly to Mainwaring and began to deplore the necessity of his
early departure which Richardson had already made known to him with
practical and satisfying reasons

I hope you wont forget my dear fellow that your most really urgent
business is to look after your health and if hereafter youll only
remember the old Lookout enough to impress that fact upon you I shall
feel that any poor service I have rendered you has been amply repaid

Mainwaring notwithstanding that he winced slightly at this fateful
echo of Louises advice returned the grasp of his friends hand with an
honest pressure equal to his own He longed now only for the coming of
Richardson to complete his scheme of grateful benefaction to his host

The banker came fortunately as the conversation began to flag and Mrs
Bradleys halfcoquettish illhumor of a pretty woman and Louises
abstracted indifference were becoming so noticeable as to even impress
Minty into a thoughtful taciturnity The graciousness of his reception
by Mrs Bradley somewhat restored his former ostentatious gallantry and
his selfsatisfied domineering manner had enough masculine power in it
to favorably affect the three women who it must be confessed were a
little bored by the finer abstractions of Bradley and Mainwaring
After a few moments Mainwaring rose and with a significant glance at
Richardson to remind him of his proposed conference with Bradley turned
to leave the room He was obliged to pass Louise who was sitting by the
table His attention was suddenly arrested by something in her hand with
which she was listlessly playing It was the stone which he had put on
his letter to her

As he had not been present when Bradley arrived he did not know that
this fateful object had been brought home by his host who after
receiving it from Richelieu had put it in his pocket to illustrate
his story of the discovery On the contrary it seemed that Louises
careless exposure of his foolish stratagem was gratuitously and
purposely cruel Nevertheless he stopped and looked at her

Thats a queer stone you have there he said in a tone which she
recognized as coldly and ostentatiously civil

Yes she replied without looking up its the outcrop of that mine
She handed it to him as if to obviate any further remark I thought you
had seen it before

The outcrop he repeated dryly That isititit is the indication
or sign of something important thats below itisnt it

Louise shrugged her shoulders sceptically It dont follow Its just
as likely to cover rubbish after youve taken the trouble to look

Thanks he said with measured gentleness and passed quietly out of
the room

The moon had already risen when Bradley with his brierwood pipe
preceded Richardson upon the veranda The latter threw his large frame
into Louises rockingchair near the edge of the abyss Bradley with
his own chair tilted against the side of the house after the national
fashion waited for him to speak The absence of Mainwaring and the
stimulus of Mrs Bradleys graciousness had given the banker a certain
condescending familiarity which Bradley received with amused and
ironical tolerance that his twinkling eyes made partly visible in the
darkness

One of the things I wanted to talk to you about Bradley was that old
affair of the advance you asked for from the Bank We did not quite see
our way to it then and speaking as a business man it isnt really a
matter of business now but it has lately been put to me in a light that
would make the doing of it possibleyou understand The fact of the
matter is this Sir Robert Mainwaring the father of the young
fellow youve got in your house is one of our directors and
largest shareholders and I can tell youif you dont suspect it
alreadyyouve been lucky Bradleydeucedly luckyto have had him in
your house and to have rendered him a service Hes the heir to one
of the largest landed estates in his country one of the oldest county
families and will step into the title some day But ahem he coughed
patronizingly you knew all that No Well that charming wife of
yours at least does for shes been talking about it Gad Bradley it
takes those women to find out anything of that kind eh

The light in Bradleys eyes and his pipe went slowly out together

Then well say that affair of the advance is as good as settled Its
Sir Roberts wish you understand and this young fellows wishand if
youll come down to the Bank next week well arrange it for you I
think youll admit theyre doing the handsome to you and yours And
therefore he lowered his voice confidentially youll see Bradley
that it will only be the honorable thing in you you know to look upon
the affair as finished and in fact to do all you canhe drew his
chair closertototo drop this other foolishness

I dont think I quite understand you said Bradley slowly

But your wife does if you dont returned Richardson bluntly I
mean this foolish flirtation between Louise Macy and Mainwaring which
is utterly preposterous Why man it cant possibly come to anything
and it couldnt be allowed for a moment Look at his position and hers
I should think as a practical man it would strike you

Only one thing strikes me Richardson interrupted Bradley in a
singularly distinct whisper rising and moving nearer the speaker it
is that youre sitting perilously near the edge of this veranda For by
the living God if you dont take yourself out of that chair and out of
this house I wont be answerable for the consequences

Hold on there a minute will you said Mainwarings voice from the
window

Both men turned towards it A long leg was protruding from Mainwarings
window it was quickly followed by the other leg and body of the
occupant and the next moment Mainwaring come towards the two men with
his hands in his pockets

Not so loud he said looking towards the house

Let that man go said Bradley in a repressed voice You and I
Mainwaring can speak together afterwards

That man must stay until he hears what I have got to say said
Mainwaring stepping between them He was very white and grave in
the moonlight but very quiet and he did not take his hands from his
pockets Ive listened to what he said because he came here on MY
business which was simply to offer to do you a service That was all
Bradley that I told him to do This rot about what he expects of you in
return is his own impertinence If youd punched his head when he began
it it would have been all right But since he has begun it before he
goes I think he ought to hear me tell you that I have already OFFERED
myself to Miss Macy and she has REFUSED me If she had given me the
least encouragement I should have told you before Further I want to
say that in spite of that mans insinuations I firmly believe that no
one is aware of the circumstance except Miss Macy and myself

I had no idea of intimating that anything had happened that was not
highly honorable and creditable to you and the young lady began
Richardson hurriedly

I dont know that it was necessary for you to have any ideas on the
subject at all said Mainwaring sternly nor that having been shown
how you have insulted this gentleman and myself you need trouble us an
instant longer with your company You need not come back I will manage
my other affairs myself

Very well Mr Mainwaringbutyou may be sure that I shall certainly
take the first opportunity to explain myself to Sir Robert returned
Richardson as with an attempt at dignity he strode away

There was an interval of silence

Dont be too hard upon a fellow Bradley said Mainwaring as Bradley
remained dark and motionless in the shadow It is a poor return Im
making you for your kindness but I swear I never thought of anything
likelikethis

Nor did I said Bradley bitterly

I know it and thats what makes it so infernally bad for me Forgive
me wont you Think of me old fellow as the wretchedest ass you ever
met but not such a cad as this would make me As Mainwaring stepped
out from the moonlight towards him with extended hand Bradley grasped
it warmly

Thankstherethanks old fellow And BradleyI saydont
say anything to your wife for I dont think she knows it And
Bradleylook hereI didnt like to be anything but plain before that
fellow but I dont mind telling YOU now that its all over that I
really think LouiseMiss Macydidnt altogether understand me either

With another shake of the hand they separated for the night For a long
time after Mainwaring had gone Bradley remained gazing thoughtfully
into the Great Canyon He thought of the time when he had first come
there full of life and enthusiasm making an ideal world of his pure
and wholesome eyrie on the ledge What else he thought will probably
never be known until the misunderstanding of honorable and chivalrous
men by a charming and illogical sex shall incite the audacious pen of
some more daring romancer

When he returned to the house he said kindly to his wife I have been
thinking today about your hotel scheme and I shall write to Sacramento
tonight to accept that capitalists offer




CHAPER V


The sun was just rising In two years of mutation and change it had seen
the little cottage clinging like a swallows nest to the rocky caves of
a great Sierran canyon give way to a straggling manygalleried hotel
and a dozen blackened chimneys rise above the barren tableland where
once had stood the lonely forge To that conservative orb of light and
heat there must have been a peculiar satisfaction in looking down a few
hours earlier upon the battlements and gables of Oldenhurst whose base
was deeply embedded in the matured foundations and settled traditions
of an English county For the rising sun had for ten centuries found
Oldenhurst in its place from the heavy stone terrace that covered the
deadandforgotten wall where a Roman sentinel had once paced to
the little grating in the cloistered quadrangle where it had seen a
Cistercian brother place the morning dole It had daily welcomed the
growth of this vast and picturesque excrescence of the times it had
smiled every morning upon this formidable yet quaint incrustation
of power and custom ignoring as Oldenhurst itself had ignored the
generations who possessed it the men who built it the men who carried
it with fire and sword the men who had lied and cringed for it the
King who had given it to a favorite the few brave hearts who had died
for it in exile and the one or two who had bought and paid for it For
Oldenhurst had absorbed all these and more until it had become a story
of the past incarnate in stone greenwood and flower it had even
drained the lifeblood from adjacent hamlets repaying them with tumuli
growths like its own in the shape of purposeless lodges quaintly
incompetent hospitals and schools and churches where the inestimable
blessing and knowledge of its gospel were taught and fostered Nor had
it dealt more kindly with the gentry within its walls sending some to
the scaffold pillorying others in infamous office reducing a few to
poverty and halting its later guests with gout and paralysis It had
given them in exchange the dubious immortality of a portrait gallery
from which they stared with stony and equal resignation it had
preserved their useless armor and accoutrements it had set up their
marble effigies in churches or laid them in crosslegged attitudes to
trip up the unwary until in death as in life they got between the
congregation and the Truth that was taught there It had allowed an
Oldenhurst crusader with a broken nose like a pugilist on the strength
of his having been twice to the Holy Land to hide the beautifully
illuminated Word from the lowlier worshipper on the humbler benches it
had sent an iconoclastic Bishop of the Reformation to a nearer minster
to ostentatiously occupy the place of the consecrated image he had
overthrown Small wonder that crowding the Oldenhurst retainers
gradually into smaller space with occasional Sabbath glimpses of the
living rulers of Oldenhurst already in railedoff exaltation it had
forced them to accept Oldenhurst as a synonym of eternity and left the
knowledge of a higher Power to what time they should be turned out
to their longer sleep under the tender grass of the beautiful outer
churchyard

And even so while every stone of the pile of Oldenhurst and every tree
in its leafy park might have been eloquent with the story of vanity
selfishness and unequal justice it had been left to the infinite mercy
of Nature to seal their lips with a spell of beauty that left mankind
equally dumb earth air and moisture had entered into a gentle
conspiracy to soften mellow and clothe its external blemishes of
breach and accident its irregular design its additions accretions
ruins and lapses with a harmonious charm of outline and color poets
romancers and historians had equally conspired to illuminate the
dark passages and uglier inconsistencies of its interior life with the
glamour of their own fancy The fragment of menacing keep with its
choked oubliettes became a bower of tender ivy the grim story of its
crimes properly edited by a contemporary bard of the family passed
into a charming ballad Even the superstitious darkness of its religious
house had escaped through fallen roof and shattered wall leaving only
the foliated and sunpierced screen of front with its rosewindow and
pinnacle of cross behind Pilgrims from all lands had come to see
it fierce Republicans had crossed the seas to gaze at its mediaeval
outlines and copy them in wood and stucco on their younger soil
Politicians had equally pointed to it as a convincing evidence of their
own principles and in refutation of each other and it had survived
both For it was this belief in its own perpetuity that was its strength
and weakness And that belief was never stronger than on this bright
August morning when it was on the verge of dissolution A telegram
brought to Sir Robert Mainwaring had even then as completely shattered
and disintegrated Oldenhurst in all it was and all it meant as if the
brownpaper envelope had been itself charged with the electric fluid

Sir Robert Mainwaring whose family had for three centuries possessed
Oldenhurst had received the news of his financial ruin and the vast
pile which had survived the repeated invasion of superstition force
intrigue and even progress had succumbed to a foe its founders and
proprietors had loftily ignored and left to Jews and traders The
acquisition of money except by despoilment gift royal favor or
inheritance had been unknown at Oldenhurst The present degenerate
custodian of its fortunes staggering under the weight of its
sentimental mortmain already alluded to had speculated in order to
keep up its material strength that was gradually shrinking through
impoverished land and the ruined trade it had despised He had invested
largely in California mines and was the chief shareholder in a San
Francisco Bank But the mines had proved worthless the Bank had that
morning suspended payment owing to the failure of a large land and
timber company on the Sierras which it had imprudently carried
The spark which had demolished Oldenhurst had been fired from the new
telegraphstation in the hotel above the great Sierran canyon

There was a large houseparty at Oldenhurst that morning But it had
been a part of the history of the Mainwarings to accept defeat gallantly
and as became their blood Sir Percivalthe second gentleman on the
left as you entered the libraryunhorsed dying on a distant moor
with a handful of followers abandoned by a charming Prince and a
miserable cause was scarcely a greater hero than this ruined but
undaunted gentleman of eighty entering the breakfastroom a few
hours later as jauntily as his gout would permit and conscientiously
dispensing the hospitalities of his crumbling house When he had
arranged a few pleasure parties for the day and himself thoughtfully
anticipated the different tastes of his guests he turned to Lady
Mainwaring

Dont forget that somebody ought to go to the station to meet the
Bradleys Frank writes from St Moritz that they are due here today

Lady Mainwaring glanced quickly at her husband and said sotto voce Do
you think theyll care to come NOW They probably have heard all about
it

Not how it affects me returned Sir Robert in the same tone and
as they might think that because Frank was with them on that California
mountain we would believe it had something to do with Richardson
involving the Bank in that wretched company we must really INSIST upon
their coming

Bradley echoed the Hon Captain FitzHarry overhearing the name
during a late forage on the sideboard Bradleythere was an awfully
pretty American at Biarritz travelling with a cousin I thinka Miss
Mason or Macy Those sort of people you know who have a companion
as pretty as themselves bring you down with the other barrel if one
misseseh Very clever both of them and hardly any accent

Mr Bradley was a very dear friend of Franks and most kind to him
said Lady Mainwaring gravely

Didnt know there WAS a Mr Bradley really He didnt come to the
fore then said the unabashed Captain Deuced hard to follow up those
American husbands

And their wives wouldnt thank you if you did said Lady Griselda
Armiger with a sweet smile

If it is the Mrs Bradley I mean said Lady Canterbridge from the
lower end of the table looking up from her letter who looks a little
like Mrs Summertree and has a pretty cousin with her who has very good
frocks Im afraid you wont be able to get her down here Shes booked
with engagements for the next six weeks She and her cousin made all the
running at Grigsby Royal and she has quite deposed that other American
beauty in Northforelands good graces She regularly affiched him and
it is piteous to see him follow her about No my dear I dont believe
theyll come to any one of less rank than a Marquis If they did Im
sure Canterbridge would have had them at Buckenthorpe already

I wonder if there was ever anything in Franks admiration of this Miss
Macy said Lady Mainwaring a few moments later lingering beside her
husband in his study

I really dont know said Sir Robert abstractedly his letters were
filled with her praises and Richardson thought

Pray dont mention that mans name again said Lady Mainwaring with
the first indication of feeling she had shown I shouldnt trust him

But why do you ask returned her husband

Lady Mainwaring was silent for a moment She is very rich I believe
she said slowly At least Frank writes that some neighbors of theirs
whom he met in the Engadine told him they had sold the site of that
absurd cottage where he was ill for some extravagant sum

My dear Geraldine said the old man affectionately taking his wifes
hand in his own that now for the first time trembled if you have any
hope based upon what you are thinking of now let it be the last and
least You forget that Paget told us that with the best care he could
scarcely ensure Franks return to perfect health Even if God in his
mercy spared him long enough to take my place what girl would be
willing to tie herself to a man doomed to sickness and poverty Hardly
the one you speak of my dear

Lady Canterbridge proved a true prophet Mrs Bradley and Miss Macy
did not come regretfully alleging a previous engagement made on the
continent with the Duke of Northforeland and the Marquis of Dungeness
but the unexpected and apocryphal husband DID arrive I myself have not
seen my wife and cousin since I returned from my visit to your son
in Switzerland I am glad they were able to amuse themselves without
waiting for me at a London hotel though I should have preferred to
have met them here Sir Robert and Lady Mainwaring were courteous but
slightly embarrassed Lady Canterbridge who had come to the station in
bored curiosity raised her clear blue eyes to his He did not look like
a fool a complaisant or fashionablycynical husbandthis welldressed
wellmannered but quietly and sympathetically observant man Did he
really care for his selfish wife was it perfect trust or some absurd
Transatlantic custom She did not understand him It wearied her and she
turned her eyes indifferently away Bradley a little irritated he knew
not why at the scrutiny of this tall handsome gentlemanlylooking
woman who however in spite of her broad shoulders and narrow hips
possessed a refined muliebrity superior to mere womanliness of outline
turned slightly towards Sir Robert Lady Canterbridge Franks cousin
explained Sir Robert hesitatingly as if conscious of some vague
awkwardness Bradley and Lady Canterbridge both bowedpossibly the
latters salutation was the most masculineand Bradley eventually
forgetting her presence plunged into an earnest sympathetic and
intelligent account of the condition in which he found the invalid at
St Moritz The old man at first listened with an almost perfunctory
courtesy and a hesitating reserve but as Bradley was lapsing into
equal reserve and they drove up to the gates of the quadrangle he
unexpectedly warmed with a word or two of serious welcome Looking up
with a halfunconscious smile Bradley met Lady Canterbridges examining
eyes

The next morning finding an opportunity to be alone with him Bradley
with a tactful mingling of sympathy and directness informed his host
that he was cognizant of the disaster that had overtaken the Bank and
delicately begged him to accept any service he could render him Pardon
me he said if I speak as plainly to you as I would to your son my
friendship for him justifies an equal frankness to any one he loves but
I should not intrude upon your confidence if I did not believe that my
knowledge and assistance might be of benefit to you Although I did not
sell my lands to Richardson or approve of his methods he continued I
fear it was some suggestion of mine that eventually induced him to form
the larger and more disastrous scheme that ruined the Bank So you see
he added lightly I claim a right to offer you my services Touched
by Bradleys sincerity and discreet intelligence Sir Robert was equally
frank During the recital of his Californian investmentsa chronicle
of almost fatuous speculation and imbecile enterpriseBradley was
profoundly moved at the naive ignorance of business and hopeless
ingenuousness of this old habitue of a cynical world and an intriguing
and insincere society to whom no scheme had been too wild for
acceptance As Bradley listened with a halfsaddened smile to the grave
visions of this aged enthusiast he remembered the sons unsophisticated
simplicity what he had considered as the boyishness of immaturity was
the taint of the utterly unpractical Mainwaring blood It was upon this
blood and others like it that Oldenhurst had for centuries waxed and
fattened

Bradley was true to his promise of assistance and with the aid of two
or three of his brothermillionaires whose knowledge of the resources
of the locality was no less powerful and convincing than the security
of their actual wealth managed to stay the immediate action of the
catastrophe until the affairs of the Sierran Land and Timber Company
could be examined and some plan of reconstruction arranged

During this interval of five months in which the credit of Sir Robert
Mainwaring was preserved with the secret of his disaster Bradley was a
frequent and welcome visitor to Oldenhurst Apart from his strange and
chivalrous friendship for the Mainwaringswhich was as incomprehensible
to Sir Robert as Sir Roberts equally eccentric and Quixotic
speculations had been to Bradleyhe began to feel a singular and weird
fascination for the place A patient martyr in the vast London house he
had taken for his wife and cousins amusement he loved to escape the
loneliness of its autumn solitude or the occasional greater loneliness
of his wifes social triumphs The handsome thoughtful man who
sometimes appeared at the foot of his wifes table or melted away like
a wellbred ghost in the hollow emptiness of her brilliant receptions
piqued the languid curiosity of a few A distinguished personage known
for his tactful observance of convenances that others forgot had made a
point of challenging this gentlemanly apparition and had followed it up
with courteous civilities which led to exchange of much respect but no
increase of acquaintance He had even spent a week at Buckenthorpe with
Canterbridge in the coverts and Lady Canterbridge in the musicroom and
library He had returned more thoughtful and for some time after
was more frequent in his appearances at home and more earnest in his
renewed efforts to induce his wife to return to America with him

Youll never be happy anywhere but in California among those common
people she replied and while I was willing to share your poverty
THERE she added dryly I prefer to share your wealth among civilized
ladies and gentlemen Besides she continued we must consider Louise
She is as good as engaged to Lord Dunshunner and I do not intend that
you shall make a mess of her affairs here as you did in California

It was the first time he had heard of Lord Dunshunners proposals it
was the first allusion she had ever made to Louise and Mainwaring

Meantime the autumn leaves had fallen silently over the broad terraces
of Oldenhurst with little changes to the fortunes of the great house
itself The Christmas houseparty included Lady Canterbridge whose
husband was still detained at Homburg in company with Dunshunner
and Bradley whose wife and cousin lingered on the continent He was
slightly embarrassed when Lady Canterbridge turned to him one afternoon
as they were returning from the lake and congratulated him abruptly upon
Louises engagement

Perhaps you dont care to be congratulated she said as he did not
immediately respond and you had as little to do with it as with that
other It is a womans function

What other echoed Bradley

Lady Canterbridge slightly turned her handsome head towards him as she
walked unbendingly at his side Tell me how you manage to keep
your absolute simplicity so fresh Do you suppose it wasnt known at
Oldenhurst that Frank had quite compromised himself with Miss Macy over
there

It certainly was not known over there said Bradley curtly

Dont be angry with me

Such an appeal from the tall indifferent woman at his side so
confidently superior to criticism and uttered in a low tone made him
smile albeit uneasily

I only meant to congratulate you she continued carelessly
Dunshunner is not a bad sort of fellow and will come into a good
property some day And then society is so made up of caprice just
now that it is well for your wifes cousin to make the most of her
opportunities while they last She is very popular now but next
season Seeing that Bradley remained silent she did not finish
the sentence but said with her usual abruptness Do you know a Miss
Araminta Eulalie Sharpe

Bradley started Could any one recognize honest Minty in the hopeless
vulgarity which this fine lady had managed to carelessly import into her
name His eye kindled

She is an old friend of mine Lady Canterbridge

How fortunate Then I can please you by giving you good news of her
She is the coming sensation They say she is very rich but quite one of
the people you know in fact she makes no scruples of telling you her
father was a blacksmith I think and takes the dear old man with her
everywhere FitzHarry raves about her and says her naivete is something
too delicious She is regularly in with some of the best people already
Lady Dungeness has taken her up and Northforeland is only waiting for
your cousins engagement to be able to go over decently Shall I ask
her to Buckenthorpecome now as an apology for my rudeness to your
cousin She was very womanly now in spite of her high collar her
straight back and her tightlyfitting jacket as she stood there
smiling Suddenly her smile faded she drew her breath in quickly

She had caught a glimpse of his usually thoughtful face and eyes now
illuminated with some pleasant memory

Thank you he said smilingly yet with a certain hesitation as
he thought of The Lookout and Araminta Eulalie Sharpe and tried to
reconcile them with the lady before him I should like it very much

Then you have known Miss Sharpe a long time continued Lady
Canterbridge as they walked on

While we were at The Lookout she was our nearest neighbor

And I suppose your wife will consider it quite proper for you to
see her again at my house said Lady Canterbridge with a return of
conventional levity

Oh quite said Bradley

They had reached the low Normanarched sideentrance to the quadrangle
As Bradley swung open the boltstudded oaken door to let her pass she
said carelessly

Then you are not coming in now

No I shall walk a little longer

And I am quite forgiven

I am thanking you very much he said smiling directly into her blue
eyes She lowered them and vanished into the darkness of the passage

The news of Mintys success was further corroborated by Sir Robert
who later that evening called Bradley into the study Frank has been
writing from Nice that he has renewed his acquaintance with some old
Californian friends of yoursa Mr and Miss Sharpe Lady Canterbridge
says that they are well known in London to some of our friends but I
would like to ask you something about them Lady Mainwaring was on the
point of inviting them here when I received a letter from Mr Sharpe
asking for a BUSINESS interview Pray who is this Sharpe

You say he writes for a BUSINESS interview asked Bradley

Yes

Bradley hesitated for a moment and then said quietly Perhaps then I
am justified in a breach of confidence to him in order to answer your
question He is the man who has assumed all the liabilities of the
Sierran Land and Timber Company to enable the Bank to resume payment
But he did it on the condition that you were never to know it For the
rest he was a blacksmith who made a fortune as Lady Canterbridge will
tell you

How very oddhow kind I mean I should like to have been civil to him
on Franks account alone

I should see him on business and be civil to him afterwards Sir
Robert received the Americans levity with his usual seriousness

No they must come here for Christmas His daughter is

Araminta Eulalie Sharpe said Bradley in defiant memory of Lady
Canterbridge

Sir Robert winced audibly I shall rely on you my dear boy to help me
make it pleasant for them he said

Christmas came but not Minty It drew a large contingent from
Oldenhurst to the quaint old church who came to view the greenwreathed
monuments and walls spotted with crimson berries as if with the blood
of former Oldenhurst warriors and to impress the wondering villagers
with the ineffable goodness and bounty of the Creator towards the Lords
of Oldenhurst and their friends Sir Robert a little gouty kept the
house and Bradley somewhat uneasy at the Sharpes absence but more
distrait with other thoughts wandered listlessly in the long library
At the lower angle it was embayed into the octagon space of a former
tower which was furnished as a quaint recess for writing or study
pierced through its enormous walls with a lanceshaped window hidden by
heavy curtains He was gazing abstractedly at the melancholy eyes of Sir
Percival looking down from the dark panel opposite when he heard the
crisp rustle of a skirt Lady Canterbridge tightly and stiffly buttoned
in black from her long narrow boots to her slim whitecollared neck
stood beside him with a prayerbook in her ungloved hand Bradley
colored quickly the penetrating incense of the Christmas boughs
and branches that decked the walls and ceilings mingled with some
indefinable intoxicating aura from the woman at his side confused his
senses He seemed to be losing himself in some forgotten past coeval
with the long quaintlylighted room the rich hangings and the painted
ancestor of this handsome woman He recovered himself with an effort
and said

You are going to church

I may meet them coming home its all the same You like HIM she said
abruptly pointing to the portrait I thought you did not care for that
sort of man over there

A man like that must have felt the impotence of his sacrifice before he
died and that condoned everything said Bradley thoughtfully

Then you dont think him a fool Bob says it was a fair bargain for
a title and an office and that by dying he escaped trial and the
confiscation of what he had

Bradley did not reply

I am disturbing your illusions again Yet I rather like them I think
you are quite capable of a sacrificeperhaps you know what it is
already

He felt that she was looking at him he felt equally that he could not
respond with a commonplace He was silent

I have offended you again Mr Bradley she said Please be
Christian and pardon me You know this is a season of peace and
goodwill She raised her blue eyes at the same moment to the Christmas
decorations on the ceiling They were standing before the parted drapery
of the lance window Midway between the arched curtains hung a spray
of mistletoethe conceit of a mischievous housemaid Their eyes met it
simultaneously

Bradley had Lady Canterbridges slim white hand in his own The next
moment voices were heard in the passage and the door nearly opposite to
them opened deliberately The idea of their apparent seclusion and half
compromising attitude flashed through the minds of both at the same
time Lady Canterbridge stepped quickly backward drawing Bradley with
her into the embrasure of the window the folds of the curtain swung
together and concealed them from view

The door had been opened by the footman ushering in a broadshouldered
man who was carrying a travellingbag and an umbrella in his hand
Dropping into an armchair before the curtain he waved away the
footman who even now mechanically repeated a previously vain attempt
to relieve the stranger of his luggage

You leave that ere grip sack where it is young man and tell Sir
Robert Mainwaring that Mr Demander Sharpe of Californy wishes to
see himon businesson BUSINESS do ye hear You hang onter that
sentenceon BUSINESS its about ez much ez you kin carry I reckon
and leave that grip sack alone

From behind the curtain Bradley made a sudden movement to go forward
but Lady Canterbridgenow quite pale but collectedrestrained him with
a warning movement of her hand Sir Roberts stick and halting step were
next heard along the passage and he entered the room His simple and
courteous greeting of the stranger was instantly followed by a renewed
attack upon the grip sack and a renewed defence of it by the
stranger

No Sir Robert said the voice argumentatively this yers a BUSINESS
interview and until its overif YOU pleasewell remain ez we air
Im Demander Sharpe of Californy and I and my darter Minty oncet had
the pleasure of knowing your boy over thar and of meeting him agin the
other day at Nice

I think said Sir Roberts voice gently that these are not the only
claims you have upon me I have only a day or two ago heard from
Mr Bradley that I owe to your generous hands and your disinterested
liberality the saving of my California fortune

There was the momentary sound of a pushedback chair a stamping of
feet and then Mr Sharpes voice rose high with the blacksmiths old
querulous aggrieved utterance

So its that finikin conceited Bradley aginthats giv me away
Ef that mans allfired belief in his being the Angel Gabriel and Danl
Webster rolled inter one dont beat anythin I suppose that highflyin
jaybird kalkilated to put you and me and my gal and yer boy inter
harness for his four hoss chariot and he sittin kam on the box drivin
us Why dont he tend to his own business and look arter his own
concernsinstead o leaving Jinny Bradley and Loo Macy dependent
on Kings and Queens and titled folks genrally and he Jim Bradley
philanderin with another mans wifewhile that thar man is hard at
work tryin to make a honest livin fer his wife buckin agin faro an
the tiger genrally at Monaco Eh And that man aintermeddlin with
me Ef continued the voice dropped to a tone of hopeless moral
conviction ef theres a man I moraly despiseits that finikin Jim
Bradley

You quite misunderstand me my dear sir said Sir Roberts hurried
voice he told me you had pledged him to secrecy and he only revealed
it to explain why you wished to see me

There was a grunt of halfplacated wrath from Sharpe and then the voice
resumed but more deliberately Well to come back to business youve
got a boy Francis and Ive got a darter Araminty Theyve sorter
taken a shine to each other and they want to get married Mind yerwait
a momentit wasnt allus so No sir when my gal Araminty first seed
your boy in Californy she was poor and she didnt kalkilate to get
inter anybodys family unbeknownst or on sufferance Then she got rich
and you got poor and thenhold on a minitshe allows does my girl
that there aint any nearer chance o their making a match than they
were afore for she isnt goin to hev it said that she married your son
fur the chance of some day becomin Lady Mainwaring

One moment Mr Sharpe said the voice of the Baronet gravely I am
both flattered and pained by what I believe to be the kindly object of
your visit Indeed I may say I have gathered a suspicion of what might
be the sequel of this most unhappy acquaintance of my son and your
daughter but I cannot believe that he has kept you in ignorance of his
unfortunate prospects and his still more unfortunate state of health

When I told ye to hold on a minit continued the blacksmiths voice
with a touch of querulousness in its accent that was jist wot I was
comin to I knowed part of it from my own pocket she knowed the rest
of it from his lip and the doctors she interviewed And then she says to
mesez my girl MintyPop she sez hes got nothing to live for now
but his title and that he never may live to get so that I think ye kin
jist go Pop and fairly and squarely as a honest man ask his father
to let me hev him Thems my darters own words Sir Robert and when
I tell yer that shes got a million o dollars to back them yell know
she means business every time

Did Francis know that you were coming here

Bless ye no he dont know that she would have him Ef it kem to that
he aint even asked her She wouldnt let him until she was sure of
YOU

Then you mean to say there is no engagement

In course not I reckoned to do the square thing first with ye

The halting step of the Baronet crossing the room was heard distinctly
He had stopped beside Sharpe My dear Mr Sharpe he said in a
troubled voice I cannot permit this sacrifice It is tootoo great

Then said Sharpe s voice querulously Im afraid we must do without
your permission I didnt reckon to find a sort o British Jim Bradley
in you If YOU cant permit my darter to sacrifice herself by marryin
your son I cant permit her to sacrifice her love and him by NOT
marryin him So I reckon this yer interview is over

I am afraid we are both old fools Mr Sharpe butwe will talk this
over with Lady Mainwaring Come There was evidently a slight struggle
near the chair over some inanimate object But the next moment the
Baronets voice rose persuasively Really I must insist upon
relieving you of your bag and umbrella

Well if youll let me telegraph yes to Minty I dont care if yer
do

When the room was quiet again Lady Canterbridge and James Bradley
silently slipped from the curtain and without a word separated at the
door


There was a merry Christmas at Oldenhurst and at Nice But whether
Mintys loving sacrifice was accepted or not or whether she ever
reigned as Lady Mainwaring or lived an untitled widow I cannot
say But as Oldenhurst still exists in all its pride and power it is
presumed that the peril that threatened its fortunes was averted
and that if another heroine was not found worthy of a frame in its
picturegallery at least it had been sustained as of old by devotion
and renunciation
