GRANDTHER BALDWINS THANKSGIVING

 UNDERNEATH protected branches from the highway just aloof
 Stands the house of Grandther Baldwin with its gently sloping roof

 Square of shape and solidtimbered it was standing I have heard
 In the days of Whig and Tory under royal George the Third

 Many a time I well remember I have gazed with Childish awe
 At the bullethole remaining in the sturdy oaken door

 Turning round halfapprehensive recking not how time had fled
 Of the lurking savage foeman from whose musket it was sped

 Not far off the barn plethoric with the autumns harvest spoils
 Holds the farmers wellearned trophiesthe guerdon of his toils

 Filled the lofts with hay sweetscented ravished from the meadows green
 While beneath are stalled the cattle with their quiet drowsy mien

 Deep and spacious are the grainbins brimming oer with natures gold
 Here are piles of yellow pumpkins on the barnfloor loosely rolled

 Just below in deep recesses safe from wintry frost chill
 There are heaps of ruddy apples from the orchard the hill

 Many a year has Grandther Baldwin in the old house dwelt in peace
 As his hair each year grew whiter he has seen his herds increase

 Sturdy sons and comely daughters growing up from childish plays
 One by one have met lifes duties and gone forth their several ways


 Hushed the voice of childish laughter hushed is childhoods merry tone
 the fireside Grandther Baldwin and his good wife sit alone

 Turning round halfapprehensive recking not how time had fled
 Of the lurking savage foeman from whose musket it was sped

 Not far off the barn plethoric with the autumn harvest spoils
 Holds the farmers wellearned trophiesthe guerdon of his toils

 Filled the lofts with hay sweetscented ravished from the meadows green
 While beneath are stalled the cattle with their quiet drowsy mien

 Deep and spacious are the grainbins brimming oer with natures gold
 Here are piles of yellow pumpkins on the barnfloor loosely rolled

 Just below in deep recesses safe from wintry frost and chill
 There are heaps of ruddy apples from the orchard on the hill

 Many a year has Grandther Baldwin in the old house dwelt in peace
 As his hair each year grew whiter he has seen his herds increase

 Sturdy sons and comely daughters growing up from childish plays
 One by one have met lifes duties and gone forth their several ways

 Hushed the voice of childish laughter hushed is childhoods merry tone
 By the fireside Grandther Baldwin and his good wife sit alone


 Yet once within the twelvemonth when the days are short and drear
 And chill winds chant the requiem of the slowly fading year

 When the autumn work is over and the harvest gathered in
 Once again the old house echoes to a long unwonted din

 Logs of hickory blaze and crackle in the fireplace huge anti high
 Curling wreaths of smoke mount upward to the gray November sky

 Ruddy lads and smiling lasses just let loose from schooldoms cares
 Patter patter race and clatter up and down the great hall stairs

 All the boys shall hold high revel all the girls shall have their way
 Thats the law at Grandther Baldwins upon each Thanksgiving Day

 From from the parlors sacred precincts hark a madder uproar yet
 Roguish Charlies playing stagecoach and the stagecoach has upset

 Joe blackeyed and laughterloving Grandthers specs his nose across
 Gravely winks at brother Willie who is gayly playing horse

 Grandmas face is fairly radiant Grandther knows not how to frown
 though the children in their frolic turn the old house upside down


 For the boys may hold high revel and the girls must have their way
 Thats the law at Grandther Baldwins upon each Thanksgiving Day

 But the dinnerah the dinnerwords are feeble to portray
 What a culinary triumph is achieved Thanksgiving Day

 Fairly groans the board with dainties but the turkey rules the roast
 Aldermanic at the outset at the last a fleshless ghost

 Then the richness of the pudding and the flavor of the pie
 When youve dined at Grandma Baldwins you will know as well as I

 When at length the feast was ended Grandther Baldwin bent his head
 And amid the solemn silence with a reverent voice he said

 Now unto God the Gracious One we thanks and homage pay
 Who guardeth us and guideth us and loveth us always

 He scatters blessings in our paths He giveth us increase
 He crowns us with His kindnesses and granteth us His peace

 Unto himself our wandering feet we pray that He may draw
 And may we strive with faithful hearts to keep His holy law


 His simple words in silence died a moments hush And then
 From all the listening hearts there rose a solemnvoiced Amen





ST NICHOLAS

 In the faroff Polar seas
 Far beyond the Hebrides
 Where the icebergs towering high
 Seem to pierce the wintry sky
 And the furclad Esquimaux
 Glides in sledges oer the snow
 Dwells St Nick the merry wight
 Patron saint of Christmas night

 Solid walls of massive ice
 Bearing many a quaint device
 Flanked by graceful turrets twain
 Clear as clearest porcelain
 Bearing at a lofty height
 Christs pure cross in simple white
 Carven with surpassing art
 From an icebergs crystal heart

 Here St Nick in royal state
 Dwells until December late
 Clips the days at either end
 And the nights at each extend
 Then with his attendant sprites
 Scours the earth on wintry nights
 Bringing home in wellfilled hands
 Childrens gifts from many lands

 Here are whistles tops and toys
 Meant to gladden little boys
 Skates and sleds that soon will glide
 Oer the ice or steep hillside
 Here are dolls with flaxen curls
 Sure to charm the little girls
 Christmas books with pictures gay
 For this welcome holiday

 In the court the reindeer wait
 Filled the sledge with costly freight
 As the first faint shadow falls
 Promptly from his icy halls
 Steps St Nick and grasps the rein
 And afar in measured time
 Sounds the sleighbells silver chime

 Like an arrow from the bow
 Speed the reindeer oer the snow
 Onward Now the loaded sleigh
 Skirts the shores of Hudsons Bay
 Onward till the stunted tree
 Gains a loftier majesty
 And the curling smokewreaths rise
 Under less inclement skies

 Built upon a hillside steep
 Lies a city wrapt in sleep
 Up and down the lonely street
 Sleepy watchmen pace their beat
 Little heeds them Santa Claus
 Not for him are human laws
 With a leap he leaves the ground
 Scales the chimney at a bound

 Five small stockings hang below
 Five small stockings in a row
 From his pocket blithe St Nick
 Fills the waiting stockings quick
 Some with sweetmeats some with toys
 Gifts for girls and gifts for boys
 Mounts the chimney like a bird
 And the bells are once more heard

 Santa Claus Good Christmas saint
 In whose heart no selfish taint

 Findeth place some homes there be
 Where no stockings wait for thee
 Homes where sad young faces wear
 Painful marks of Want and Care
 And the Christmas morning brings
 No fair hope of better things

 Can you not some crumbs bestow
 On these Children steeped in woe
 Steal a single look of care
 Which their sad young faces wear
 From your overflowing store
 Give to them whose hearts are sore
 No sad eyes should greet the morn
 When the infant Christ was born




BARBARAS COURTSHIP

 Tis just three months and eke a day
 Since in the meadows raking hay
 On looking up I chanced to see
 The manors lord young Arnold Lee
 With a loose hand on the rein
 Riding slowly down the lane
 As I gazed with earnest look
 On his face as on a book
 As if conscious of the gaze
 Suddenly he turned the rays
 Of his brilliant eyes on me
 Then I looked down hastily
 While my heart like caged bird
 Fluttered till it might be heard
 Foolish foolish Barbara

 We had never met before
 He had been so long away
 Visiting some foreign shore
 I have heard my father say
 What in truth was he to me
 Rich and handsome Arnold Lee
 Fate had placed us far apart
 Why then did my restless heart
 Flutter when his careless glance
 Fell on me by merest chance
 Foolish foolish Barbara

 There are facesare there not
 That can never be forgot
 Looks that seen but once impress
 With peculiar vividness
 So it was with Arnold Lee
 Why it was I cannot say
 That through all the livelong day
 He seemed ever near to me
 While I raked as in a dream
 Now the same place oer and oer
 Till my little sister chid
 And with full eyes opened wide
 Much in wonder gently cried
 Why what ails thee Barbara

 I am in the fields again
 Tis a pleasant day in June
 All the songsters are in tune
 Pouring out their matin hymn
 All at once a conscious thrill
 Led me half against my will
 To look up Abashed I see
 His dark eyes full fixed on me
 What he said I do not know
 But his voice was soft and low
 As he spoke in careless chat
 Now of this and now of that
 While the murmurous waves of sound
 Wafted me a bliss profound
 Foolish foolish Barbara

 Am I waking Scarce I know
 If I wake or if I dream
 So unreal all things seem
 Yet I could not well forego
 This sweet dream if dream it be
 That has brought such joy to me
 He has told me that he loves me
 He in rank so far above me
 And when I with cheeks aglow
 Told him that it was not meet
 He should wed with one so low
 He should wed with one so low
 Then he said in accents sweet
 Far be thoughts of rank or pelf
 Dear I love thee for thyself
 Happy happy Barbara





THE CONFESSION

 I am glad that you have come
 Arthur from the dusty town
 You must throw aside your cares
 And relax your legal frown
 Coke and Littleton avaunt
 You have ruled him through the day
 In this quiet sylvan haunt
 Be content to yield your sway

 It is pleasant is it not
 Sitting here beneath the trees
 While the restless wind above
 Ripples over leafy seas

 Often when the twilight falls
 In the shadow quite alone
 I have sat till starlight came
 Listening to its monotone
 Yet not always quite alone
 Brother let me take the place
 Just behind you now the moon
 Shines no longer in my face

 It is near two months ago
 Since I met him as I think
 By Gods mercy when my horse
 Trembled on the rivers brink
 I had fallen but his arm
 Firmly seized the bridlerein
 And with one decided grasp
 Drew me back to life again
 I was grateful and essayed
 Fitting words my thanks to speak
 Arthur when the heart feels most
 Words I think are oftenest weak


 So I stammered and I fear
 What I said had little grace
 But I knew he understood
 By the smile upon his face
 There are faceshis was such
 That are sealed when in repose
 Only when a smile floods out
 All the soul in beauty glows
 With that smile I grew content
 And my heart grew strangely calm
 As with trustful step I walked
 My arm resting on his arm

 Brother turn your face away
 So dear I can tell you best
 All that followed but be sure
 You are looking to the west
 Arthur I have seen him since
 Nearly every day until
 If I lose him all my life
 Would grow wan and dark and chill
 Brother this my love impute
 Not to me for maidenshame
 He has sought me for his wife
 He would crown me with his name
 Only yesterday he said
 That my love his life would bless
 Would I grant it Arthur dear
 Was I wrong in saying Yes





ROSE IN THE GARDEN

 THIRTY years have come and gone
 Melting away like Southern Snows
 Since in the light of a summers night
 I went to the garden to seek my Rose

 Mine Do you hear it silver moon
 Flooding my heart with your mellow shine
 Mine Be witness ye distant stars
 Looking on me with eyes divine

 Tell me tell me wandering winds
 Whisper it if you may not speak
 Did you ever in all your round
 Fan a lovelier brow or cheek

 Long I nursed in my heart the love
 Love which felt but dared not tell
 Till I scarcely know how or when
 It found wild wordsand all was well

 I can hear her sweet voice even now
 It makes my pulses leap and thrill
 I owe you more than I well can pay
 You may take me Robert if you will

 One pleasant summer night
 the garden walks alone
 Looking about with restless eyes
 Wondering whither my Rose had flown

 Till from a leafy arbor near
 There came to my ears the sound of speech
 Who can be with Rose to night
 Let me hide me under the beach

 It must be one of her female friends
 Talking with her in the gloaming gray
 PerchanceI thoughtthey may speak of me
 Let me listen to what they say

 This I said with a careless smile
 And a joyous heart that was free from fears
 Little I dreamed that the words I heard
 Would weigh on my heavy heart for years

 Rose my Rose for your heart is mine
 I heard in a low voice passionfraught
 In the sight of Heaven we are truly one
 Why will you cast me away for naught

 Will you give your hand where your heart goes not
 To a man who is grave and stern and old
 And whose love compared with my passionheat
 As the snow of the frozen North is cold

 And RoseI could feel her cheek grow pale
 Her voice was tremulous then grew strong
 Richard she said your words are wild
 And you do my guardian bitter wrong

 Did you never hear how years gone by
 She spoke in a tremulous undertone
 Bereft of friends oer the worlds highways
 I wandered forth as a child alone

 He opened to me his home and heart
 He whom you call so stern and cold
 And my grateful heart I may well bestow
 On him for his kindness manifold

 Rose he said in a saddened tone
 I thank him for all he has done for thee
 He has acted noblyI did him wrong
 But is there no voice in your heart for me

 And Roseshe trembledI felt it all
 I heard her quick breath come and go
 Her voice was broken she only said
 Have pity Richard and let me go

 And thenHeaven gave me strength I think
 I stood before them calm and still
 You might have thought my tranquil breast
 Had never known one passionthrill

 And they alternate flushed and paled
 Rose tottered and I feared would fall
 I caught her in supporting arms
 And whispered Rose I heard it all

 I had a dream but it is passed
 That we might journey hand in hand
 Along the rugged steeps of life
 Until we reached Gods promised land

 This was my dreamtis over now
 Thank Heaven it is not yet too late
 I pray no selfish act of mine
 May keep two young hearts separate

 I placed her passive hand in his
 With how much pain God only knows
 And blessing him for her sweet sake
 I left him standing with my Rose





PHOEBES WOOING

 PHOEBE Phoebe Where is the chit
 When I want her most shes out of the way
 Child youre running a long account
 Up to be squared on Judgmentday

 Where have you been and what have you there
 To the pasture for buttercups wet with dew
 My patience I think you are out of your wits
 I wonder what good will buttercups do

 Theres pennyroyal you might have got
 It might have been useful to you or me
 But I never heard in all my life
 Of buttercup cordial or buttercup tea

 I want you to stay and mind the bread
 Ive just put two loaves in the oven to bake
 When they are clone take them carefully out
 And put in their place this loaf of cake

 While I run over to Widow Browns
 Her son from the mines has just got back
 I dont believe hes a cent in his purse
 Young men are so shiftless now alack

 It was very different when I was young
 Young men were prudent and girls were wise
 You wouldnt catch them gadding about
 Like so many idle butterflies

 So bustled and scolded the worthy dame
 Until she had passed the outer sill
 To do her justice it seldom chanced
 That her hands were idle or tongue was still


 So Phoebe gathered her knitting up
 And sat her down in the chimney niche
 But her mind was on other thoughts intent
 And here and there she dropped a stitch

 The yellow kitten purred on the hearth
 While the kitchen clock with its frame of oak
 In the corner stood like a sentinel
 And challenged time with its measured stroke

 But Phoebes mind was on none of these
 The bread in the oven her good aunts frown
 And the scene before her faded away
 And blended with thoughts of Reuben Brown

 How they walked together on summer days
 Or bravely faced the winters chill
 And chatted merrily all the way
 To the little schoolhouse on Sligo Hill

 How both grew older and schooldays passed
 When he was a youth and a maiden she
 How often she went with Reuben Brown
 To the rustic dance or the social bee

 The warm flush deepened on Phoebes cheek
 And she breathed a low halfconscious sigh
 Ah welladay they were happy times
 But he has forgotten and so must I

 So Phoebe gathered her knitting up
 Which while she was thinking had fallen down
 When her quick ear caught a strange footfall
 And there in the doorway stood Reuben Brown

 With the same frank handsome face she knew
 A smile as bright and an eye as black
 Phoebe he said I have wandered far
 Are you glad to see your playmate back

 The kitten still purred on the kitchen hearth
 And the ancient clock with its frame of oak
 In the corner stood like a sentinel
 And challenged time with its measured stroke

 A pleased light shone in the maidens eyes
 Ah love young love it is very sweet
 Reuben had gone but she sat quite still
 And the knitting lay untouched at her feet

 Just then the dame came bustling in
 And went to the oven without ado
 Why Phoebe child what have you done
 The bread is baked as black as my shoe

 And Phoebe started and blushed for shame
 Took up her knitting and dropped it down
 And when her aunt said What ails you child
 She hastily answered Reuben Brown

 Ah love young love it is very sweet
 In field or hamlet or crowded mart
 But it burns with the brightest purest flame
 In the hidden depths of a young maids heart




THE LOST HEART

 One golden summer day
 Along the forestway
 Young Colin passed with blithesome steps alert

 His locks with careless grace
 Rimmed round his handsome face
 And drifted outward on the airy surge

 So blithe of heart was he
 He hummed a melody
 And all the birds were hushed to hear him sing

 Across his shoulders flung
 His bow and baldric hung
 So in true huntsmans guise he threads the wood

 The sun mounts up the sky
 The air moves sluggishly
 And reeks with summer heat in every pore

 His limbs begin to tire
 Slumbers his youthful fire
 He sinks upon a violetbed to rest

 The soft winds go and come
 With low and drowsy hum
 And ope for him the ivory gate of dreams

 Beneath the forestshade
 There trips a woodland maid
 And marks with startled eye the sleeping youth

 At first she thought to fly
 Then timid drawing nigh
 She gazed in wonder on his fair young face

 When swiftly stooping down
 Upon his locks so brown
 She lightly pressed her lips and blushing fled

 When Colin woke from sleep
 From slumbers calm and deep
 He felthe knew not howhis heart had flown

 And so with anxious care
 He wandered here and there
 But could not find his lost heart anywhere

 Then he with air distraught
 And brow of anxious thought
 Went out into the world beyond the wood

 Of each that passed him by
 He queried anxiously
 I prithee hast thou seen a heart astray

 Some stared and hurried on
 While others said in scorn
 Your heart has gone in search of your lost wits

 The day is wearing fast
 Young Colin comes at last
 To where a cottage stood embowered in trees

 He looks within and there
 He sees a maiden fair
 Who sings low songs the while she plies her wheel

 I prithee maiden bright
 She turns as quick as light
 And straight a warm flush crimsons all her face

 She much abashed looks down
 For on his locks so brown
 She seems to see the marks her lips have made


 Whereby she stands confest
 What need to tell the rest
 He said I think fair maid you have my heart

 Nay do not give it back
 I shall not feel the lack
 If thou wilt give to me thine own therefor





JOHN MAYNARD

 Twas on Lake Eries broad expanse
 One bright midsummer day
 The gallant steamer Ocean Queen
 Swept proudly on her way
 Bright faces clustered on the deck
 Or leaning oer the side
 Watched carelessly the feathery foam
 That flecked the rippling tide

 Ah who beneath that cloudless sky
 That smiling bends serene
 Could dream that danger awful vast
 Impended oer the scene
 Could dream that ere an hour had sped
 That frame of sturdy oak
 Would sink beneath the lakes blue waves
 Blackened with fire and smoke

 A seaman sought the captains side
 A moment whispered low
 The captains swarthy face grew pale
 He hurried down below
 Alas too late Though quick and sharp
 And clear his orders came
 No human efforts could avail
 To quench the insidious flame

 The bad news quickly reached the deck
 It sped from lip to lip
 And ghastly Faces everywhere
 Looked from the doomed ship
 Is there no hopeno chance of life
 A hundred lips implore
 But one the captain made reply
 To run the ship on shore

 A sailor whose heroic soul
 That hour should yet reveal
 By name John Maynard easternborn
 Stood calmly at the wheel
 Head her southeast the captain shouts
 Above the smothered roar
 Head her southeast without delay
 Make for the nearest shore

 No terror pales the helmsmans cheek
 Or clouds his dauntless eye
 As in a sailors measured tone
 His voice responds Ay ay
 Three hundred souls the steamers freight
 Crowd forward wild with fear
 While at the stern the dreaded flames
 Above the deck appear

 John Maynard watched the nearing flames
 But still with steady hand
 He grasped the wheel and steadfastly
 He steered the ship to land
 John Maynard can you still hold out
 He heard the captain cry
 A voice from out the stifling smoke
 Faintly responds Ay ay

 But half a mile a hundred hands
 Stretch eagerly to shore
 But half a mile That distance sped
 Peril shall all be oer
 But half a mile Yet stay the flames
 No longer slowly creep
 But gather round that helmsman bold
 With fierce impetuous sweep

 John Maynard with an anxious voice
 The captain cries once more
 Stand by the wheel five minutes yet
 And we shall reach the shore
 Through flame and smoke that dauntless heart
 Responded firmly still
 Unawed though face to face with death
 With Gods good help I will

 The flames approach with giant strides
 They scorch his hand and brow
 One arm disabled seeks his side
 Ah he is conquered now
 But no his teeth are firmly set
 He crushes down his pain
 His knee upon the stanchion pressed
 He guides the ship again

 One moment yet one moment yet
 Brave heart thy task is oer
 The pebbles grate beneath the keel
 The steamer touches shore
 Three hundred grateful voice rise
 In praise to God that he
 Hath saved them from the fearful fire
 And from the engulphing sea

 But where is he that helmsman bold
 The captain saw him reel
 His nerveless hands released their task
 He sank beside the wheel
 The wave received his lifeless corpse
 Blackened with smoke and fire
 God rest him Never hero had
 A nobler funeral pyre





FRIAR ANSELMO

 Friar Anselmo Gods grace may he win
 Committed one sad day a deadly sin

 Which being done he drew back selfabhorred
 From the rebuking presence of the Lord

 And kneeling down besought with bitter cry
 Since life was worthless grown that he might die

 All night he knelt and when the morning broke
 In patience still he waits deaths fatal stroke

 When all at once a cry of sharp distress
 Aroused Anselmo from his wretchedness

 And looking from the convent window high
 He saw a wounded traveller gasping lie

 Just underneath who bruised and stricken sore
 Had crawled for aid unto the convent door

 The friars heart with deep compassion stirred
 When the poor wretchs groans for help were heard

 With gentle hands and touched with love divine
 He bathed his wounds and poured in oil and wine

 With tender foresight cared for all his needs
 A blessed ministry of noble deeds

 In such devotion passed seven days At length
 The poor wayfarer gained his wonted strength

 With grateful thanks he left the convent walls
 And once again on death Anselmo calls

 When lo his cell was filled with sudden light
 And on the wall he saw an angel write

 An angel in whose likeness he could trace
 More noble grown the travellers form and face

 Courage Anselmo though thy sin be great
 God grants thee life that thou mayst expiate

 Thy guilty stains shall be washed white again
 By noble service done thy fellowmen

 His soul draws nearest unto God above
 Who to his brother ministers in love

 Meekly Anselmo rose and after prayer
 His soul was lightened of its past despair

 Henceforth he strove obeying Gods high will
 His heavenappointed mission to fulfil

 And many a soul oppressed with pain and grief
 Owed to the friar solace and relief





MISCELLANEOUS POEMS




THE CHURCH AT STRATFORDONAVON

 One autumn day when hedges yet were green
 And thickbranched trees diffused a leafy gloom
 Hard by where Avon rolls its silvery tide
 I stood in silent thought by Shakspeares tomb

 O happy church beneath whose marble floor
 His ashes lie who so enriched mankind
 The manysided Shakespeare rare of soul
 And dowered with an allembracing mind

 Through the stained windows rays of sunshine fall
 In softened glory on the chancel floor
 While I a pilgrim from across the sea
 stand with bare head in reverential awe

 Churches there are within whose gloomy vaults
 Repose the bones of those that once were kings
 Their power has passed and what remains but clay
 While in his grave our Shakspeare lives and sings

 Kings were his puppets kingdoms but his stage
 Faint shadows they without his plastic art
 He waves his wand and lo they live again
 And in his world perform their mimic part

 Born in the purple his imperial soul
 Sits crowned and sceptred in the realms of mind
 Kingdoms may fall and crumble to decay
 Time but confirms his empire oer mankind





MRS BROWNINGS GRAVE AT FLORENCE

 FLORENCE wears an added grace
 All her earlier honors crowning
 Dantes birthplace Arts fair home
 Holds the dust of Barrett Browning

 Guardian of the noble dead
 That beneath thy soil lie sleeping
 England with full heart commends
 This new treasure to thy keeping

 Take her she is half thine own
 In her verses rich outpouring
 Breathes the warm Italian heart
 Yearning for the lands restoring

 From thy skies her poetheart
 Caught a fresher inspiration
 And her soul obtained new strength
 With her bodily translation

 Freely take what thou hast given
 Less her verses rhythmic beauty
 Than the stirring notes that called
 Trumpetlike thy sons to duty

 Rarest of exotic flowers
 In thy native chaplet twining
 To the temple of thy great
 Add hershe is worth enshrining




MY CASTLE

 I have a beautiful castle
 With towers and battlements fair
 And many a banner with gay device
 Floats in the outer air

 The walls are of solid silver
 The towers are of massive gold
 And the lights that stream from the windows
 A royal scene unfold

 Ah could you but enter my castle
 With its pomp of regal sheen
 You would say that it far surpasses
 The palace of Aladeen

 Could you but enter as I do
 And pace through the vaulted hall
 And mark the stately columns
 And the pictures on the wall

 With the costly gems about them
 That send their light afar
 With a chaste and softened splendor
 Like the light of a distant star

 And where is this wonderful castle
 With its rich emblazonings
 Whose pomp so far surpasses
 The homes of the greatest kings

 Come out with me at morning
 And lie in the meadowgrass
 And lift your eyes to the ether blue
 And you will see it pass

 There can you not see the battlements
 And the turrets stately and high
 Whose lofty summits are tipped with clouds
 And lost in the arching sky

 Dear friend you are only dreaming
 Your castle so stately and fair
 Is only a fanciful structure
 A castle in the air

 Perchance you are right I know not
 If a phantom it may be
 But yet in my inmost heart I feel
 That it lives and lives for me

 For when clouds and darkness are round me
 And my heart is heavy with care
 I steal me away from the noisy crowd
 To dwell in my castle fair

 There are servants to do my bidding
 There are servants to heed my call
 And I with a masters air of pride
 May pace through the vaulted hall

 And I envy not the monarchs
 With cities under their sway
 For am I not in my own right
 A monarch as proud as they

 What matter then if to others
 My castle a phantom may be
 Since I feel in the depths of my own heart
 That it is not so to me




APPLEBLOSSOMS

 I sit in the shadow of appleboughs
 In the fragrant orchard close
 And around me floats the scented air
 With its wavelike tidal flows
 I close my eyes in a dreamy bliss
 And call no king my peer
 For is not this the rare sweet time
 The blossoming time of the year

 I lie on a couch of downy grass
 With delicate blossoms strewn
 And I feel the throb of Natures heart
 Responsive to my own
 Oh the world is fair and God is good
 That maketh life so dear
 For is not this the rare sweet time
 The blossoming time of the year

 I can see through the rifts of the appleboughs
 The delicate blue of the sky
 And the changing clouds with their marvellous tints
 That drift so lazily by
 And strange sweet thoughts sing through my brain
 And Heaven it seemeth near
 Oh is it not a rare sweet time
 The blossoming time of the year




SUMMER HOURS

 It is the years high noon
 The earth sweet incense yields
 And oer the fresh green fields
 Bends the clear sky of June

 I leave the crowded streets
 The hum of busy life
 Its clamor and its strife
 To breathe thy perfumed sweets

 O rare and golden hours
 The birds melodious song
 Wavelike is borne along
 Upon a strand of flowers

 I wander far away
 Where through the forest trees
 Sports the cool summer breeze
 In wild and wanton play

 A patriarchal elm
 Its stately form uprears
 Which twice a hundred years
 Has ruled this woodland realm

 I sit beneath its shade
 And watch with careless eye
 The brook that babbles by
 And cools the leafy glade

 In truth I wonder not
 That in the ancient days
 The temples of Gods praise
 Were grove and leafy grot

 The noblest ever planned
 With quaint device and rare
 By man can ill compare
 With these from Gods own hand

 Pilgrim with wayworn feet
 Who treading lifes dull round
 No true repose hast found
 Come to this green retreat

 For bird and flower and tree
 Green fields and woodland wild
 Shall bear with voices mild
 Sweet messages to thee





JUNE

 Throw open wide your golden gates
 O poetlanded month of June
 And waft me on your spicy breath
 The melody of birds in tune

 O fairest palace of the three
 Wherein Queen Summer holdeth sway
 I gaze upon your leafy courts
 From out the vestibule of May

 I fain would tread your garden walks
 Or in your shady bowers recline
 Then open wide your golden gates
 And make them mine and make them mine




LITTLE CHARLIE

 A VIOLET grew by the riverside
 And gladdened all hearts with its bloom
 While over the fields on the scented air
 It breathed a rich perfume
 But the clouds grew dark in the angry sky
 And its portals were opened wide
 And the heavy rain beat down the flower
 That grew by the riverside

 Not far away in a pleasant home
 There lived a little boy
 Whose cheerful face and childish grace
 Filled every heart with joy
 He wandered one day to the rivers verge
 With no one near to save
 And the heart that we loved with a boundless love
 Was stilled in the restless wave

 The sky grew dark to our tearful eyes
 And we bade farewell to joy
 For our hearts were bound by a sorrowful tie
 To the grave of the little boy
 The birds still sing in the leafy tree
 That shadows the open door
 We heed them not for we think of the voice
 That we shall hear no more

 We think of him at eventide
 And gaze on his vacant chair
 With a longing heart that will scarce believe
 That Charlie is not there
 We seem to hear his ringing laugh
 And his bounding step at the door
 But alas there comes the sorrowful thought
 We shall never hear them more

 We shall walk sometimes to his little grave
 In the pleasant summer hours
 We will speak his name in a softened voice
 And cover his grave with flowers
 We will think of him in his heavenly home
 In his heavenly home so fair
 And we will trust with a hopeful trust
 That we shall meet him there





THE WHIPPOORWILL AND I

 IN the hushed hours of night when the air quite still
 I hear the strange cry of the lone whippoorwill
 Who Chants without ceasing that wonderful trill
 Of which the sole burden is still WhippoorWill

 And why should I whip him Strange visitant
 Has he been playing truant this long summer day
 I listened a moment more clear and more shrill
 Rang the voice of the bird as he cried WhippoorWill

 But what has poor Will done I ask you once more
 Ill whip him dont fear if youll tell me what for
 I paused for an answer oer valley and hill
 Rang the voice of the bird as he cried WhippoorWill

 Has he come to your dwelling by night or by day
 And snatched the young birds from their warm nest away
 I paused for an answer oer valley and hill
 Rang the voice of the bird as he cried WhippoorWill

 Well well I can hear you dont have any fears
 I can hear what is constantly dinned in my ears
 The obstinate bird with his wonderful trill
 Still made but one answer and that WhippoorWill

 But what HAS poor Will done I prithee explain
 Im out of all patience dont mock me again
 The obstinate bird with his wonderful trill
 Still made the same answer and that WhippoorWill

 Well have your own way then but if you wont tell
 Ill shut down the window and bid you farewell
 But of one thing be sure I wont whip him until
 You give me some reason for whipping poor Will

 I listened a moment as if for reply
 But nothing was heard but the birds mocking cry
 I caught the faint echo from valley and hill
 It breathed the same burden that strange WhippoorWill




CARVING A NAME

 I wrote my name upon the sand
 And trusted it would stand for aye
 But soon alas the refluent sea
 Had washed my feeble lines away

 I carved my name upon the wood
 And after years returned again
 I missed the shadow of the tree
 That stretched of old upon the plain

 To solid marble next my name
 I gave as a perpetual trust
 An earthquake rent it to its base
 And now it lies oerlaid with dust

 All these have failed In wiser mood
 I turn and ask myself What then
 If I would have my name endure
 Ill write it on the hearts of men

 In characters of living light
 Of kindly deeds and actions wrought
 And these beyond the touch of time
 Shall live immortal as my thought





IN TIME OF WAR




GONE TO THE WAR

 My Charlie has gone to the war
 My Charlie so brave and tall
 He left his plough in the furrow
 And flew at his countrys call
 May God in safety keep him
 My precious boymy all

 My heart is pining to see him
 I miss him every day
 My heart is weary with waiting
 And sick of the long delay
 But I know his country needs him
 And I could not bid him stay

 I remember how his face flushed
 And how his color came
 When the flash from the guns of Sumter
 Lit the whole land with flame
 And darkened our countrys banner
 With the crimson hue of shame

 Mother he said then faltered
 I felt his mute appeal
 I pausedif you are a mother
 You know what mothers feel
 When called to yield their dear ones
 To the cruel bullet and steel

 My heart stood still for a moment
 Struck with a mighty woe
 A faint as of death came oer me
 I am a mother you know
 But I sternly checked my weakness
 And firmly bade him Go

 Wherever the fight is fiercest
 I know that my boy will be
 Wherever the need is sorest
 Of the stout arms of the free
 May he prove as true to his country
 As he has been true to me

 My home is lonely without him
 My hearth bereft of joy
 The thought of him who has left me
 My constant sad employ
 But God has been good to the mother
 She shall not blush for her boy




WHERE IS MY BOY TONIGHT

 When the clouds in the Western sky
 Flush red with the setting sun
 When the veil of twilight falls
 And the busy day is done
 I sit and watch the clouds
 With their crimson hues alight
 And ponder with anxious heart
 Oh where is my boy tonight

 It is just a year today
 Since he bade me a gay goodby
 To march where banners float
 And the deadly missiles fly
 As I marked his martial step
 I felt my color rise
 With all a mothers pride
 And my heart was in my eyes

 Theres a little room close by
 Where I often used to creep
 In the hush of the summer night
 To watch my boy asleep
 But he who used to rest
 Beneath the spread so white
 Is far away from me now
 Oh where is my boy tonight

 Perchance in the gathering night
 With slow and weary feet
 By the light of Southern stars
 He paces his lonely beat
 Does he think of the mothers heart
 That will never cease to yearn
 As only a mothers can
 For her absent boys return

 Oh where is my boy tonight
 I cannot answer where
 But I know wherever he is
 He is under our Fathers care
 May He guard and guide and bless
 My boy wherever he be
 And bring him back at length
 To bless and to comfort me

 May God bless all our boys
 By the campfires ruddy glow
 Or when in the deadly fight
 They front the embattled foe
 And comfort each mothers heart
 As she sits in the fading light
 And ponders with anxious heart
 Oh where is my boy tonight




A SOLDIERS VALENTINE

 Just from the sentrys tramp
 I must take it again at ten
 I have laid my musket down
 And seized instead my pen
 For pacing my lonely round
 In the chilly twilight gray
 The thought dear Mary came
 That this is St Valentines Day

 And with the thought there came
 A glimpse of the happy time
 When a schoolboys first attempt
 I sent you in borrowed rhyme
 On a giltedged sheet embossed
 With many a quaint design
 And signed in schoolboy hand
 Your loving Valentine

 The years have come and gone
 Have flown I know not where
 And the schoolboys merry face
 Is grave with manhoods care
 But the heart of the man still beats
 At the wellremembered name
 And on this St Valentines Day
 His choice is still the same

 There was a timeah well
 Think not that I repine
 When I dreamed this happy day
 Would smile on you as mine
 But I heard my countrys call
 I knew her need was sore
 Thank God no selfish thought
 Withheld me from the war

 But when the dear old flag
 Shall float in its ancient pride
 When the twain shall be made one
 And feuds no more divide
 I will lay my musket down
 My martial garb resign
 And turn my joyous feet
 Toward home and Valentine





LAST WORDS

 DEAR Charlie breathed a soldier
 O comrade true and tried
 Who in the heat of battle
 Pressed closely to my side
 I feel that I am stricken
 My life is ebbing fast
 I fain would have you with me
 Dear Charlie till the last

 It seems so sudden Charlie
 To think tomorrows sun
 Will look upon me lifeless
 And I not twentyone
 I little dreamed this morning
 Twould bring my last campaign
 Gods ways are not as our ways
 And I will not complain

 Theres one at home dear Charlie
 Will mourn for me when dead
 Whose heartit is a mothers
 Can scarce be comforted
 Youll write and tell her Charlie
 With my dear love that I
 Fought bravely as a soldier should
 And died as he should die

 And you will tell her Charlie
 She must not grieve too much
 Our country claims our young lives
 For she has need of such
 And where is he would falter
 Or turn ignobly back
 When Dutys voice cries Forward
 And Honor lights the track

 And theres another Charlie
 His voice became more low
 When thoughts of HER come oer me
 It makes it hard to go
 This locket in my bosom
 She gave me just before
 I left my native village
 For the fearful scenes of war

 Give her this message Charlie
 Sent with my dying breath
 To her and to my banner
 Im faithful unto death
 And if in that far country
 Which I am going to
 Our earthly ties may enter
 Ill there my love renew

 Come nearer closer Charlie
 My head I fain would rest
 It must be for the last time
 Upon your faithful breast
 Dear friend I cannot tell you
 How in my heart I feel
 The depth of your devotion
 Your friendship strong as steel

 Weve watched and camped together
 In sunshine and in rain
 Weve shared the toils and perils
 Of more than one campaign
 And when my tired feet faltered
 Beneath the noontide heat
 Your words sustained my courage
 Gave new strength to my feet

 And oncetwas at Antietam
 Pressed hard by thronging foes
 I almost sank exhausted
 Beneath their cruel blows
 When you dear friend undaunted
 With headlong courage threw
 Your heart into the contest
 And safely brought me through

 My words are weak dear Charlie
 My breath is growing scant
 Your hand upon my heart there
 Can you not hear me pant
 Your thoughts I know will wander
 Sometimes to where I lie
 How dark it grows True comrade
 And faithful friend goodby

 A moment and he lay there
 A statue pale and calm
 His youthful head reclining
 Upon his comrades arm
 His limbs upon the greensward
 Were stretched in careless grace
 And by the fitful moon was seen
 A smile upon his face




SONG OF THE CROAKER 

  Written by request for the Philadelphia Sanitary Fair

 An old frog lived in a dismal swamp
 In a dismal kind of way
 And all that he did whatever befell
 Was to croak the livelong day
 Croak croak croak
 When darkness filled the air
 And croak croak croak
 When the skies were bright and fair

 Good Master Frog a battle is fought
 And the foemans power is broke
 But he only turned a greener hue
 And answered with a croak
 Croak croak croak
 When the clouds are dark and dun
 And croak croak croak
 In the blaze of the noontide sun

 Good Master Frog the forces of right
 Are driving the hosts of wrong
 But he gave his head an ominous shake
 And croaked out Nous verrons
 Croak croak croak
 Till the heart is full of gloom
 And croak croak croak
 Till the world seems but a tomb

 To poison the cup of life
 By always dreading the worst
 Is to make of the earth a dungeon damp
 And the happiest life accursed
 Croak croak croak
 When the noontide sun rides high
 And croak croak croak
 Lest the night come by and by

 Farewell to the dismal frog
 Let him croak as loud as he may
 He cannot blot the sun from heaven
 Nor hinder the march of day
 Though he croak croak croak
 Till the heart is full of gloom
 And croak croak croak
 Till the world seems but a tomb





KING COTTON

 KING COTTON looks from his window
 Towards the westering sun
 And he marks with an anguished horror
 That his race is almost run

 His form is thin and shrunken
 His cheek is pale and wan
 And the lines of care on his furrowed brow
 Are dread to look upon

 But yesterday a monarch
 In the flush of his pomp and pride
 And not content with his own broad lands
 He would rule the world beside

 He built him a stately palace
 With gold from beyond the sea
 And he laid with care the cornerstone
 And he called it Slavery

 He summoned an army with banners
 To keep his foes at bay
 And gazing with pride on his palace walls
 He said They will stand for aye

 But the palace walls are shrunken
 And partly overthrown
 And the storms of war in their violence
 Have loosened the cornerstone

 Now Famine stalks through the palace halls
 With her gaunt and pallid train
 You can hear the cries of famished men
 As they cry for bread in vain

 The king can see from his palace walls
 A land by his pride betrayed
 Thousands of mothers and wives bereft
 Thousands of graves newmade

 And he seems to see in the lowering sky
 The shape of a flaming sword
 Whereon he reads with a sinking heart
 The anger of the Lord

 God speed the time when the guilty king
 Shall be hurled from his bloodstained throne
 And the palace of Wrong shall crumble to dust
 With its boasted cornerstone

 A temple of Freedom shall rise instead
 On the desecrated site
 And within its shelter alike shall stand
 The black man and the white




OUT OF EGYPT

 To Egypts king who ruled beside
 The reedy rivers flow
 Came Gods command Release O king
 And let my people go

 The kings proud heart grew hard apace
 He marked the suppliant throng
 And said Nay they must here abide
 The weak must serve the strong

 Straightway the Lord stretched forth his hand
 And every stream ran blood
 The river swept towards the sea
 A full ensanguined flood

 The haughty king beheld the land
 By plagues afflicted sore
 But as Gods wonders multiplied
 Hardened his heart the more

 Until the angel of the Lord
 Came on the wings of Night
 And smote firstborn of man and beast
 In his destructive flight

 Throughout all Egypt not a house
 Was spared this crowning woe
 Then broke the tyrants stubborn will
 He bade the people go

 They gathered up their flocks and herds
 Rejoicing to be free
 And going forth a mighty host
 Encamped beside the sea


 Then Pharaohs heart repented him
 He called a mighty force
 And swiftly followed on their track
 With chariot and with horse

 Then Israels host were sore afraid
 But God was on their side
 And lo for them a way is cleft
 The Redsea waves divide

 At Gods command the restless waves
 Obey the prophets rod
 And through the middle of the sea
 The people marched dryshod

 But when the spoilers following close
 Would hinder Israels flight
 The waters to their course return
 The parted waves unite

 And Pharaohs host is swept away
 The chariots and the horse
 And not a man is left alive
 Of all that mighty force

 So in these days God looks from heaven
 And marks his servants woe
 Hear ye his voice Break every yoke
 And let my people go

 For them the Redsea waves divide
 The streams with crimson flow
 Therefore we mourn for our firstborn
 Then let the people go

 They are not weak whom God befriends
 He makes their cause His own
 And they who fight against Gods might
 Shall surely be oerthrown




THE PRICE OF VICTORY

 A VICTORYa victory
 Is flashed across the wires
 Speed speed the news from State to State
 Light up the signal fires
 Let all the bells from all the towers
 A joyous peal ring out
 Weve gained a glorious victory
 And put the foe to rout

 A mother heard the chiming bells
 Her joy was mixed with pain
 Pray God she said my gallant boy
 Be not among the slain
 Alas for her that very hour
 Outstretched in death he lay
 The color from his fair young face
 Had scarcely passed away

 His nerveless hand still grasped the sword
 He never more might wield
 His eyes were sealed in dreamless sleep
 Upon that bloody field
 The chestnut curls his mother oft
 Had stroked in fondest pride
 Neglected hung in clotted locks
 With deepest crimson dyed

 Ah many a mothers heart shall ache
 And bleed with anguish sore
 When tidings come of him who marched
 So blithely forth to war
 Oh sad for them the stricken down
 In manhoods early dawn
 And sadder yet for loving hearts
 God comfort them that mourn

 Yes victory has a fearful price
 Our hearts may shrink to pay
 And tears will mingle with the joy
 That greets a glorious day
 But he who dies in freedoms cause
 We cannot count him lost
 A battle won for truth and right
 Is worth the blood it cost

 O mothers count it something gained
 That they for whom you mourn
 Bequeath fair Freedoms heritage
 To millions yet unborn
 And better than a thousand years
 Of base ignoble breath
 A patriots fragrant memory
 A heros early death





HARVARD ODES



 SUNG AT ANNUAL DINNERS OF THE HARVARD CLUB

 OF New York NEW YORK


 HARVARD ODES

 I

 Feb 23 1869

 Fair Harvard dear guide of our youths golden days
 At thy name all our hearts own a thrill
 We turn from lifes highways its business its cares
 We are boys in thy tutelage still
 And the warm blood of youth to our veins as of yore
 Returns with impetuous flow
 Reviving the scenes and the hopes that were ours
 In the vanished but sweet Long Ago

 Once more through thy walks Alma Mater we tread
 And we dream youths fair dreams once again
 We are heroes in fight for the Just and the Right
 We are knights without fear without stain
 Its doors in fair prospect the world opens wide
 Its prizes seem easy to win
 We are strong in our faith we are bold in our might
 And we long for the race to begin

 Though dimmed are our hopes and our visions are fled
 Our dreams were but dreams it is true
 Duststained from the contest we gather tonight
 The sweet dreams of youth to renew
 Enough for tomorrow the cares it shall bring
 We are boys we are brothers tonight
 And our hearts warm with love Alma Mater to thee
 Shall in loyal devotion unite




 II

 Feb 11 1870

 As we meet in thy name Alma Mater tonight
 All our hearts and our hopes are as one
 And love for the mother that nurtured his youth
 Beats high in the breast of each son
 The sweet chords of Memory bridge oer the Past
 The years fade away like a dream
 By the banks of Cephissus beneath the green trees
 We tread thy fair walks Academe

 The heights of Hymettus that bound the near view
 Fill the air with an odor as sweet
 As the beautiful clusters of suntinted grapes
 From the vineyards that lie at our feet
 O realm of enchantment O Wonderful land
 Where the gods hold high converse with men
 Come out from the dusk of past ages once more
 And live in our fancy again

 Let us drink to the Past as our glasses we lift
 Let eye speak to eye heart to heart
 Let the bonds of sweet fellowship bind each to each
 In the hours that remain ere we part
 And thou Alma Mater grown fairer with age
 Let us echo the blessing that fell
 From thy motherly lips as we stood at thy side
 And thou badst us Godspeed and Farewell




 III

 Feb 21 1872

 Fair Harvard the months have accomplished their round
 And a year stands fullorbed and complete
 Since last at thy summons with dutiful hearts
 Thy children sat here at thy feet
 Since last in thy presence grown youthful once more
 We drank to the past and its joys
 Shaking off every care that encumbered our years
 And dreamed that again we were boys

 Tonight once again in thy presence we meet
 In the freshness and flush of lifes spring
 We wait but thy blessing we ask but thy smile
 As our sails to the free air we fling
 The winds breathe auspicious that waft us along
 The sky undisturbed smiles serene
 Hope stands at the prow and the waters gleam bright
 With sparkles of silvery sheen

 And thy voice Alma Mater so potent and sweet
 Still sounds in our ears as of yore
 And thy motherly counsel we hear wisdomfraught
 As we push our frail barks from the shore
 From the foamcrested waves of the mountainous sea
 As backward our glances we strain
 We see the dear face of our mother benign
 And bless her again and again




 IV

 Feb 21 1873

 Theres a fountain of Fable whose magical power
 Times ravages all could repair
 And replace the bowed form and the tottering step
 The wrinkles and silvery hair
 By the brown flowing locks and the graces of youth
 Its footstep elastic and light
 Could mantle the cheek with its longvanished bloom
 And make the dull eye keen and bright

 Tis only a fablea beautiful dream
 But the fable the dream shall come true
 As thy sons Alma Mater assemble tonight
 The joys of past years to renew
 Our eyes shall grow bright with their old wonted light
 Our spirits untrammelled by care
 And the Goddess of Hope with her fresh rainbow tints
 Shall paint every prospect more fair

 How sweet were the friendships we formed in thy halls
 How strong were the tendrils that bound
 Our hearts to the mother whose provident care
 Encompassed her children around
 Now strong in our manhood we cherish her still
 And if by misfortune brought low
 Our strength shall support her our arms bear her up
 And sustain her through weal and through woe





OCCASIONAL ODES




BICENTENNIAL ODE 

 June 13 1860

  Sung at the bicentennial celebration of the incorporation
 of Marlboro Mass


 From the door of the homestead the mother looks forth
 With a glance half of hope half of fear
 For the clock in the corner now points to the hour
 When the children she loves should appear
 For have they not promised whatever betide
 On this their dear mothers birthday
 To gather once more round the family board
 Their dutiful service to pay

 From the East and the West from the North and the South
 In communion and intercourse sweet
 Her children have come on this festival day
 To sit as of old at her feet
 And our motherGod bless her benevolent face
 How her heart thrills with motherly joys
 As she stands at the portal with arms opened wide
 To welcome her girls and her boys

 And yet when the first joyful greetings are oer
 When the words of her welcome are said
 A shadow creeps over her motherly face
 As she silently thinks of the dead
 Of the children whose voices once rang through her fields
 Who shared all her hopes and alarms
 Till tired with the burden and heat of the day
 They have fallen asleep in her arms

 They have gone from our midst but their labors abide
 On the fields where they prayerfully wrought
 They scattered the seed but the harvest is ours
 By their toil and selfsacrifice bought
 As we scan the fair scene that once greeted their eyes
 As we tread the same paths which they trod
 Let us tenderly think of our elders by birth
 Who have gone to their rest and their God

 God bless the old homestead some linger there still
 In the haunts which their childhood has known
 While others have wandered to places remote
 And planted new homes of their own
 But Time cannot weaken the ties Love creates
 Nor absence nor distance impede
 The filial devotion which thrills all our hearts
 As we bid our old mother Godspeed




FOR THE CONSECRATION OF A CEMETERY

 This verdant field that smiles to Heaven
 In Natures bright array
 From common uses set apart
 We consecrate today

 Gods Acre be it fitly called
 For when beneath the sod
 We lay the dead with reverent hands
 We yield them back to God

 And His great love so freely given
 Shall speak in clearer tones
 When pacing through these hallowed walks
 We read memorial stones

 Here let the sunshine softly fall
 And gently drop the rain
 And Natures countless harmonies
 Blend one accordant strain

 That they who seek this sacred place
 In mourning solitude
 In all this gracious company
 May have their faith renewed

 So lifted to serener heights
 And purified from dross
 Their trustful hearts shall rest on God
 And profit by their loss

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
