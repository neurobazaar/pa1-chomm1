THE CHRONICLE OF THE DRUM

 PART I


 At Paris hard by the Maine barriers
 Whoever will choose to repair
 Midst a dozen of woodenlegged warriors
 May haply fall in with old Pierre
 On the sunshiny bench of a tavern
 He sits and he prates of old wars
 And moistens his pipe of tobacco
 With a drink that is named after Mars

 The beer makes his tongue run the quicker
 And as long as his tap never fails
 Thus over his favorite liquor
 Old Peter will tell his old tales
 Says he In my lifes ninety summers
 Strange changes and chances Ive seen
 So heres to all gentlemen drummers
 That ever have thumpd on a skin

 Brought up in the art military
 For four generations we are
 My ancestors drummd for King Harry
 The Huguenot lad of Navarre
 And as each man in life has his station
 According as Fortune may fix
 While Conde was waving the baton
 My grandsire was trolling the sticks

 Ah those were the days for commanders
 What glories my grandfather won
 Ere bigots and lackeys and panders
 The fortunes of France had undone
 In Germany Flanders and Holland
 What foeman resisted us then
 No my grandsire was ever victorious
 My grandsire and Monsieur Turenne

 He died and our noble battalions
 The jade fickle Fortune forsook
 And at Blenheim in spite of our valiance
 The victory lay with Malbrook
 The news it was brought to King Louis
 Corbleu how his Majesty swore
 When he heard they had taken my grandsire
 And twelve thousand gentlemen more

 At Namur Ramillies and Malplaquet
 Were we posted on plain or in trench
 Malbrook only need to attack it
 And away from him scamperd we French
 Cheer up tis no use to be glum boys
 Tis written since fighting begun
 That sometimes we fight and we conquer
 And sometimes we fight and we run

 To fight and to run was our fate
 Our fortune and fame had departed
 And so perishd Louis the Great
 Old lonely and half brokenhearted
 His coffin they pelted with mud
 His body they tried to lay hands on
 And so having buried King Louis
 They loyally served his greatgrandson

 God save the beloved King Louis
 For so he was nicknamed by some
 And now came my father to do his
 Kings orders and beat on the drum
 My grandsire was dead but his bones
 Must have shaken Im certain for joy
 To hear daddy drumming the English
 From the meadows of famed Fontenoy

 So well did he drum in that battle
 That the enemy showd us their backs
 Corbleu it was pleasant to rattle
 The sticks and to follow old Saxe
 We next had Soubise as a leader
 And as luck hath its changes and fits
 At Rossbach in spite of dads drumming
 Tis said we were beaten by Fritz

 And now daddy crossd the Atlantic
 To drum for Montcalm and his men
 Morbleu but it makes a man frantic
 To think we were beaten again
 My daddy he crossd the wide ocean
 My mother brought me on her neck
 And we came in the year fiftyseven
 To guard the good town of Quebec

 In the year fiftynine came the Britons
 Full well I remember the day
 They knocked at our gates for admittance
 Their vessels were moord in our bay
 Says our general Drive me yon redcoats
 Away to the sea whence they come
 So we marched against Wolfe and his bulldogs
 We marched at the sound of the drum

 I think I can see my poor mammy
 With me in her hand as she waits
 And our regiment slowly retreating
 Pours back through the citadel gates
 Dear mammy she looks in their faces
 And asks if her husband is come
 He is lying all cold on the glacis
 And will never more beat on the drum

 Come drink tis no use to be glum boys
 He died like a soldier in glory
 Heres a glass to the health of all drumboys
 And now Ill commence my own story
 Once more did we cross the salt ocean
 We came in the year eightyone
 And the wrongs of my father the drummer
 Were avenged by the drummer his son

 In Chesapeake Bay we were landed
 In vain strove the British to pass
 Rochambeau our armies commanded
 Our ships they were led by De Grasse
 Morbleu How I rattled the drumsticks
 The day we marchd into Yorktown
 Ten thousand of beefeating British
 Their weapons we caused to lay down

 Then homewards returning victorious
 In peace to our country we came
 And were thanked for our glorious actions
 By Louis Sixteenth of the name
 What drummer on earth could be prouder
 Than I while I drummd at Versailles
 To the lovely court ladies in powder
 And lappets and long satintails

 The Princes that day passd before us
 Our countrymens glory and hope
 Monsieur who was learned in Horace
 DArtois who could dance the tightrope
 One night we kept guard for the Queen
 At her Majestys operabox
 While the King that majestical monarch
 Sat filing at home at his locks

 Yes I drummd for the fair Antoinette
 And so smiling she lookd and so tender
 That our officers privates and drummers
 All vowd they would die to defend her
 But she cared not for us honest fellows
 Who fought and who bled in her wars
 She sneerd at our gallant Rochambeau
 And turned Lafayette out of doors

 Ventrebleu then I swore a great oath
 No more to such tyrants to kneel
 And so just to keep up my drumming
 One day I drummd down the Bastille
 Ho landlord a stoup of fresh wine
 Come comrades a bumper well try
 And drink to the year eightynine
 And the glorious fourth of July

 Then bravely our cannon it thunderd
 As onwards our patriots bore
 Our enemies were but a hundred
 And we twenty thousand or more
 They carried the news to King Louis
 He heard it as calm as you please
 And like a majestical monarch
 Kept filing his locks and his keys

 We showd our republican courage
 We stormd and we broke the great gate in
 And we murderd the insolent governor
 For daring to keep us awaiting
 Lambesc and his squadrons stood by
 They never stirrd finger or thumb
 The saucy aristocrats trembled
 As they heard the republican drum

 Hurrah what a storm was abrewing
 The day of our vengeance was come
 Through scenes of what carnage and ruin
 Did I beat on the patriot drum
 Lets drink to the famed tenth of August
 At midnight I beat the tattoo
 And woke up the Pikemen of Paris
 To follow the bold Barbaroux

 With pikes and with shouts and with torches
 Marchd onwards our dusty battalions
 And we girt the tall castle of Louis
 A million of tatterdemalions
 We stormd the fair gardens where towerd
 The walls of his heritage splendid
 Ah shame on him craven and coward
 That had not the heart to defend it

 With the crown of his sires on his head
 His nobles and knights by his side
 At the foot of his ancestors palace
 Twere easy methinks to have died
 But no when we burst through his barriers
 Mid heaps of the dying and dead
 In vain through the chambers we sought him
 He had turnd like a craven and fled

     

 You all know the Place de la Concorde
 Tis hard by the Tuilerie wall
 Mid terraces fountains and statues
 There rises an obelisk tall
 There rises an obelisk tall
 All garnishd and gilded the base is
 Tis surely the gayest of all
 Our beautiful citys gay places

 Around it are gardens and flowers
 And the Cities of France on their thrones
 Each crownd with his circlet of flowers
 Sits watching this biggest of stones
 I love to go sit in the sun there
 The flowers and fountains to see
 And to think of the deeds that were done there
 In the glorious year ninetythree

 Twas here stood the Altar of Freedom
 And though neither marble nor gilding
 Was used in those days to adorn
 Our simple republican building
 Corbleu but the MERE GUILLOTINE
 Cared little for splendor or show
 So you gave her an axe and a beam
 And a plank and a basket or so

 Awful and proud and erect
 Here sat our republican goddess
 Each morning her table we deckd
 With dainty aristocrats bodies
 The people each day flocked around
 As she sat at her meat and her wine
 Twas always the use of our nation
 To witness the sovereign dine

 Young virgins with fair golden tresses
 Old silverhaird prelates and priests
 Dukes marquises barons princesses
 Were splendidly served at her feasts
 Ventrebleu but we pamperd our ogress
 With the best that our nation could bring
 And dainty she grew in her progress
 And called for the head of a King

 She called for the blood of our King
 And straight from his prison we drew him
 And to her with shouting we led him
 And took him and bound him and slew him
 The monarchs of Europe against me
 Have plotted a godless alliance
 Ill fling them the head of King Louis
 She said as my gage of defiance

 I see him as now for a moment
 Away from his jailers he broke
 And stood at the foot of the scaffold
 And lingerd and fain would have spoke
 Hodrummer quick silence yon Capet
 Says Santerre with a beat of your drum
 Lustily then did I tap it
 And the son of Saint Louis was dumb


 PART II


 The glorious days of September
 Saw many aristocrats fall
 Twas then that our pikes drunk the blood
 In the beautiful breast of Lamballe
 Pardi twas a beautiful lady
 I seldom have looked on her like
 And I drummd for a gallant procession
 That marched with her head on a pike

 Lets show the pale head to the Queen
 We saidshell remember it well
 She looked from the bars of her prison
 And shriekd as she saw it and fell
 We set up a shout at her screaming
 We laughd at the fright she had shown
 At the sight of the head of her minion
 How shed tremble to part with her own

 We had taken the head of King Capet
 We called for the blood of his wife
 Undaunted she came to the scaffold
 And bared her fair neck to the knife
 As she felt the foul fingers that touchd her
 She shrunk but she deigned not to speak
 She lookd with a royal disdain
 And died with a blush on her cheek

 Twas thus that our country was saved
 So told us the safety committee
 But psha Ive the heart of a soldier
 All gentleness mercy and pity
 I loathed to assist at such deeds
 And my drum beat its loudest of tunes
 As we offered to justice offended
 The blood of the bloody tribunes

 Away with such foul recollections
 No more of the axe and the block
 I saw the last fight of the sections
 As they fell neath our guns at Saint Rock
 Young BONAPARTE led us that day
 When he sought the Italian frontier
 I followd my gallant young captain
 I followd him many a long year

 We came to an army in rags
 Our general was but a boy
 When we first saw the Austrian flags
 Flaunt proud in the fields of Savoy
 In the glorious year ninetysix
 We marchd to the banks of the Po
 I carried my drum and my sticks
 And we laid the proud Austrian low

 In triumph we enterd Milan
 We seized on the Mantuan keys
 The troops of the Emperor ran
 And the Pope he tell down on his knees
 Pierres comrades here calld a fresh bottle
 And clubbing together their wealth
 They drank to the Army of Italy
 And General Bonapartes health

 The drummer now bared his old breast
 And showd us a plenty of scars
 Rude presents that Fortune had made him
 In fifty victorious wars
 This came when I followd bold Kleber
 Twas shot by a Mameluke gun
 And this from an Austrian sabre
 When the field of Marengo was won

 My forehead has many deep furrows
 But this is the deepest of all
 A Brunswicker made it at Jena
 Beside the fair river of Saal
 This cross twas the Emperor gave it
 God bless him it covers a blow
 I had it at Austerlitz fight
 As I beat on my drum in the snow

 Twas thus that we conquerd and fought
 But wherefore continue the story
 Theres never a baby in France
 But has heard of our chief and our glory
 But has heard of our chief and our fame
 His sorrows and triumphs can tell
 How bravely Napoleon conquerd
 How bravely and sadly he fell

 It makes my old heart to beat higher
 To think of the deeds that I saw
 I followd bold Ney through the fire
 And charged at the side of Murat
 And so did old Peter continue
 His story of twenty brave years
 His audience followd with comments
 Rude comments of curses and tears

 He told how the Prussians in vain
 Had died in defence of their land
 His audience laughd at the story
 And vowd that their captain was grand
 He had fought the red English he said
 In many a battle of Spain
 They cursed the red English and prayed
 To meet them and fight them again

 He told them how Russia was lost
 Had winter not driven them back
 And his company cursed the quick frost
 And doubly they cursed the Cossack
 He told how the stranger arrived
 They wept at the tale of disgrace
 And they longd but for one battle more
 The stain of their shame to efface

 Our country their hordes overrun
 We fled to the fields of Champagne
 And fought them though twenty to one
 And beat them again and again
 Our warrior was conquerd at last
 They bade him his crown to resign
 To fate and his country he yielded
 The rights of himself and his line

 He came and among us he stood
 Around him we pressd in a throng
 We could not regard him for weeping
 Who had led us and loved us so long
 I have led you for twenty long years
 Napoleon said ere he went
 Wherever was honor I found you
 And with you my sons am content

 Though Europe against me was armd
 Your chiefs and my people are true
 I still might have struggled with fortune
 And baffled all Europe with you

 But France would have sufferd the while
 Tis best that I suffer alone
 I go to my place of exile
 To write of the deeds we have done

 Be true to the king that they give you
 We may not embrace ere we part
 But General reach me your hand
 And press me I pray to your heart

 He called for our battle standard
 One kiss to the eagle he gave
 Dear eagle he said may this kiss
 Long sound in the hearts of the brave
 Twas thus that Napoleon left us
 Our people were weeping and mute
 As he passd through the lines of his guard
 And our drums beat the notes of salute

     

 I lookd when the drumming was oer
 I lookd but our hero was gone
 We were destined to see him once more
 When we fought on the Mount of St John
 The Emperor rode through our files
 Twas June and a fair Sunday morn
 The lines of our warriors for miles
 Stretchd wide through the Waterloo corn

 In thousands we stood on the plain
 The redcoats were crowning the height
 Go scatter yon English he said
 Well sup lads at Brussels tonight
 We answered his voice with a shout
 Our eagles were bright in the sun
 Our drums and our cannon spoke out
 And the thundering battle begun

 One charge to another succeeds
 Like waves that a hurricane bears
 All day do our galloping steeds
 Dash fierce on the enemys squares
 At noon we began the fell onset
 We charged up the Englishmans hill
 And madly we charged it at sunset
 His banners were floating there still

 Go to I will tell you no more
 You know how the battle was lost
 Ho fetch me a beaker of wine
 And comrades Ill give you a toast
 Ill give you a curse on all traitors
 Who plotted our Emperors ruin
 And a curse on those redcoated English
 Whose bayonets helpd our undoing

 A curse on those British assassins
 Who orderd the slaughter of Ney
 A curse on Sir Hudson who tortured
 The life of our hero away
 A curse on all RussiansI hate them
 On all Prussian and Austrian fry
 And oh but I pray we may meet them
 And fight them again ere I die

 Twas thus old Peter did conclude
 His chronicle with curses fit
 He spoke the tale in accents rude
 In ruder verse I copied it

 Perhaps the tale a moral bears
 All tales in time to this must come
 The story of two hundred years
 Writ on the parchment of a drum

 What Peter told with drum and stick
 Is endless theme for poets pen
 Is found in endless quartos thick
 Enormous books by learned men

 And ever since historian writ
 And ever since a bard could sing
 Doth each exalt with all his wit
 The noble art of murdering

 We love to read the glorious page
 How bold Achilles killd his foe
 And Turnus felld by Trojans rage
 Went howling to the shades below

 How Godfrey led his redcross knights
 How mad Orlando slashd and slew
 Theres not a single bard that writes
 But doth the glorious theme renew

 And while in fashion picturesque
 The poet rhymes of blood and blows
 The grave historian at his desk
 Describes the same in classic prose

 Go read the works of Reverend Cox
 Youll duly see recorded there
 The history of the selfsame knocks
 Here roughly sung by Drummer Pierre

 Of battles fierce and warriors big
 He writes in phrases dull and slow
 And waves his cauliflower wig
 And shouts Saint George for Marlborow

 Take Doctor Southey from the shelf
 An LL Da peaceful man
 Good Lord how doth he plume himself
 Because we beat the Corsican

 From first to last his page is filled
 With stirring tales how blows were struck
 He shows how we the Frenchmen killd
 And praises God for our good luck

 Some hints tis true of politics
 The doctors give and statesmans art
 Pierre only bangs his drum and sticks
 And understands the bloody part

 He cares not what the cause may be
 He is not nice for wrong and right
 But show him wheres the enemy
 He only asks to drum and fight

 They bid him fightperhaps he wins
 And when he tells the story oer
 The honest savage brags and grins
 And only longs to fight once more

 But luck may change and valor fail
 Our drummer Peter meet reverse
 And with a moral points his tale
 The end of all such talesa curse

 Last year my love it was my hap
 Behind a grenadier to be
 And but he wore a hairy cap
 No taller man methinks than me

 Prince Albert and the Queen God wot
 Be blessings on the glorious pair
 Before us passed I saw them not
 I only saw a cap of hair

 Your orthodox historian puts
 In foremost rank the soldier thus
 The redcoat bully in his boots
 That hides the march of men from us

 He puts him there in foremost rank
 You wonder at his cap of hair
 You hear his sabres cursed clank
 His spurs are jingling everywhere

 Go to I hate him and his trade
 Who bade us so to cringe and bend
 And all Gods peaceful people made
 To such as him subservient

 Tell me what find we to admire
 In epaulets and scarlet coats
 In men because they load and fire
 And know the art of cutting throats

     

 Ah gentle tender lady mine
 The winter wind blows cold and shrill
 Come fill me one more glass of wine
 And give the silly fools their will

 And what care we for war and wrack
 How kings and heroes rise and fall
 Look yonder in his coffin black
 There lies the greatest of them all

 To pluck him down and keep him up
 Died many million human souls
 Tis twelve oclock and time to sup
 Bid Mary heap the fire with coals

 He captured many thousand guns
 He wrote The Great before his name
 And dying only left his sons
 The recollection of his shame

 Though more than half the world was his
 He died without a rood his own
 And borrowed from his enemies
 Six foot of ground to lie upon

 He fought a thousand glorious wars
 And more than half the world was his
 And somewhere now in yonder stars
 Can tell mayhap what greatness is

 1841

  This ballad was written at Paris at the time of the Second
 Funeral of Napoleon




ABDELKADER AT TOULON

 OR THE CAGED HAWK


 No more thou lithe and longwinged hawk of desertlife for thee
 No more across the sultry sands shalt thou go swooping free
 Blunt idle talons idle beak with spurning of thy chain
 Shatter against thy cage the wing thou neer mayst spread again

 Long sitting by their watchfires shall the Kabyles tell the tale
 Of thy dash from Ben Halifa on the fat Metidja vale
 How thou sweptst the desert over bearing down the wild El Riff
 From eastern Beni Salah to western Ouad Shelif

 How thy white burnous welit streaming like the stormrack oer the sea
 When thou rodest in the vanward of the Moorish chivalry
 How thy razzia was a whirlwind thy onset a simoom
 How thy swordsweep was the lightning dealing death from out the gloom

 Nor less quick to slay in battle than in peace to spare and save
 Of brave men wisest councillor of wise councillors most brave
 How the eye that flashed destruction could beam gentleness and love
 How lion in thee mated lamb how eagle mated dove

 Availed not or steel or shot gainst that charmed life secure
 Till cunning France in last resource tossed up the golden lure
 And the carrion buzzards round him stooped faithless to the cast
 And the wild hawk of the desert is caught and caged at last

 Weep maidens of Zerifah above the laden loom
 Scar chieftains of Al Elmah your cheeks in grief and gloom
 Sons of the Beni Snazam throw down the useless lance
 And stoop your necks and bare your backs to yoke and scourge of France

 Twas not in fight they bore him down he never cried aman
 He never sank his sword before the PRINCE OF FRANGHISTAN
 But with traitors all around him his star upon the wane
 He heard the voice of ALLAH and he would not strive in vain

 They gave him what he asked them from king to king he spake
 As one that plighted word and seal not knoweth how to break
 Let me pass from out my deserts bet mine own choice where to go
 I brook no fettered life to live a captive and a show

 And they promised and he trusted them and proud and calm he came
 Upon his black mare riding girt with his sword of fame
 Good steed good sword he rendered both unto the Frankish throng
 He knew them false and ficklebut a Princes word is strong

 How have they kept their promise Turned they the vessels prow
 Unto Acre Alexandria as they have sworn een now
 Not so from Oran northwards the white sails gleam and glance
 And the wild hawk of the desert is borne away to France

 Where Toulons whitewalled lazaret looks southward oer the wave
 Sits he that trusted in the word a son of Louis gave
 O noble faith of noble heart And was the warning vain
 The text writ by the BOURBON in the blurred black book of Spain

 They have need of thee to gaze on they have need of thee to grace
 The triumph of the Prince to gild the pinchbeck of their race
 Words are but wind conditions must be construed by GUIZOT
 Dash out thy heart thou desert hawk ere thou art made a show




THE KING OF BRENTFORDS TESTAMENT


 The noble King of Brentford
 Was old and very sick
 He summond his physicians
 To wait upon him quick
 They steppd into their coaches
 And brought their best physick

 They crammd their gracious master
 With potion and with pill
 They drenchd him and they bled him
 They could not cure his ill
 Go fetch says he my lawyer
 Id better make my will

 The monarchs royal mandate
 The lawyer did obey
 The thought of sixandeightpence
 Did make his heart full gay
 What ist says he your Majesty
 Would wish of me today

 The doctors have belabord me
 With potion and with pill
 My hours of life are counted
 O man of tape and quill
 Sit down and mend a pen or two
 I want to make my will

 Oer all the land of Brentford
 Im lord and eke of Kew
 Ive threepercents and fivepercents
 My debts are but a few
 And to inherit after me
 I have but children two

 Prince Thomas is my eldest son
 A sober Prince is he
 And from the day we breechd him
 Till now hes twentythree
 He never caused disquiet
 To his poor Mamma or me

 At school they never floggd him
 At college though not fast
 Yet his littlego and greatgo
 He creditably passd
 And made his years allowance
 For eighteen months to last

 He never owed a shilling
 Went never drunk to bed
 He has not two ideas
 Within his honest head
 In all respects he differs
 From my second son Prince Ned

 When Tom has half his income
 Laid by at the years end
 Poor Ned has neer a stiver
 That rightly he may spend
 But sponges on a tradesman
 Or borrows from a friend

 While Tom his legal studies
 Most soberly pursues
 Poor Ned most pass his mornings
 Adawdling with the Muse
 While Tom frequents his banker
 Young Ned frequents the Jews

 Ned drives about in buggies
 Tom sometimes takes a bus
 Ah cruel fate why made you
 My children differ thus
 Why make of Tom a DULLARD
 And Ned a GENIUS

 Youll cut him with a shilling
 Exclaimed the man of wits
 Ill leave my wealth said Brentford
 Sir Lawyer as befits
 And portion both their fortunes
 Unto their several wits

 Your Grace knows best the lawyer said
 On your commands I wait
 Be silent Sir says Brentford
 A plague upon your prate
 Come take your pen and paper
 And write as I dictate

 The will as Brentford spoke it
 Was writ and signed and closed
 He bade the lawyer leave him
 And turnd him round and dozed
 And next week in the churchyard
 The good old King reposed

 Tom dressed in crape and hatband
 Of mourners was the chief
 In bitter selfupbraidings
 Poor Edward showed his grief
 Tom hid his fat white countenance
 In his pockethandkerchief

 Neds eyes were full of weeping
 He falterd in his walk
 Tom never shed a tear
 But onwards he did stalk
 As pompous black and solemn
 As any catafalque

 And when the bones of Brentford
 That gentle king and just
 With bell and book and candle
 Were duly laid in dust
 Now gentleman says Thomas
 Let business be discussed

 When late our sire beloved
 Was taken deadly ill
 Sir Lawyer you attended him
 I mean to tax your bill
 And as you signed and wrote it
 I prithee read the will

 The lawyer wiped his spectacles
 And drew the parchment out
 And all the Brentford family
 Sat eager round about
 Poor Ned was somewhat anxious
 But Tom had neer a doubt

 My son as I make ready
 To seek my last long home
 Some cares I had for Neddy
 But none for thee my Tom
 Sobriety and order
 You neer departed from

 Ned hath a brilliant genius
 And thou a plodding brain
 On thee I think with pleasure
 On him with doubt and pain
 You see good Ned says Thomas
 What he thought about us twain

 Though small was your allowance
 You saved a little store
 And those who save a little
 Shall get a plenty more
 As the lawyer read this compliment
 Toms eyes were running oer

 The tortoise and the hare Tom
 Set out at each his pace
 The hare it was the fleeter
 The tortoise won the race
 And since the worlds beginning
 This ever was the case

 Neds genius blithe and singing
 Steps gayly oer the ground
 As steadily you trudge it
 He clears it with a bound
 But dulness has stout legs Tom
 And wind thats wondrous sound

 Oer fruits and flowers alike Tom
 You pass with plodding feet
 You heed not one nor tother
 But onwards go your beat
 While genius stops to loiter
 With all that he may meet

 And ever as he wanders
 Will have a pretext fine
 For sleeping in the morning
 Or loitering to dine
 Or dozing in the shade
 Or basking in the shine

 Your little steady eyes Tom
 Though not so bright as those
 That restless round about him
 His flashing genius throws
 Are excellently suited
 To look before your nose

 Thank heaven then for the blinkers
 It placed before your eyes
 The stupidest are weakest
 The witty are not wise
 Oh bless your good stupidity
 It is your dearest prize

 And though my lands are wide
 And plenty is my gold
 Still better gifts from Nature
 My Thomas do you hold
 A brain thats thick and heavy
 A heart thats dull and cold

 Too dull to feel depression
 Too hard to heed distress
 Too cold to yield to passion
 Or silly tenderness
 March onyour road is open
 To wealth Tom and success

 Ned sinneth in extravagance
 And you in greedy lust
 I faith says Ned our father
 Is less polite than just
 In you son Tom Ive confidence
 But Ned I cannot trust

 Wherefore my lease and copyholds
 My lands and tenements
 My parks my farms and orchards
 My houses and my rents
 My Dutch stock and my Spanish stock
 My five and three per cents

 I leave to you my Thomas
 What all poor Edward said
 Well well I should have spent them
 And Toms a prudent head
 I leave to you my Thomas
 To you in TRUST for Ned

 The wrath and consternation
 What poet eer could trace
 That at this fatal passage
 Came oer Prince Tom his face
 The wonder of the company
 And honest Neds amaze

 Tis surely some mistake
 Goodnaturedly cries Ned
 The lawyer answered gravely
 Tis even as I said
 Twas thus his gracious Majesty
 Ordaind on his deathbed

 See here the will is witnessd
 And heres his autograph
 In truth our fathers writing
 Says Edward with a laugh
 But thou shalt not be a loser Tom
 Well share it half and half

 Alas my kind young gentleman
 This sharing cannot be
 Tis written in the testament
 That Brentford spoke to me
 I do forbid Prince Ned to give
 Prince Tom a halfpenny

 He hath a store of money
 But neer was known to lend it
 He never helpd his brother
 The poor he neer befriended
 He hath no need of property
 Who knows not how to spend it

 Poor Edward knows but how to spend
 And thrifty Tom to hoard
 Let Thomas be the steward then
 And Edward be the lord
 And as the honest laborer
 Is worthy his reward

 I pray Prince Ned my second son
 And my successor dear
 To pay to his intendant
 Five hundred pounds a year
 And to think of his old father
 And live and make good cheer

 Such was old Brentfords honest testament
 He did devise his moneys for the best
 And lies in Brentford church in peaceful rest
 Prince Edward lived and money made and spent
 But his good sire was wrong it is confessd
 To say his son young Thomas never lent
 He did Young Thomas lent at interest
 And nobly took his twentyfive per cent

 Long time the famous reign of Ned endured
 Oer Chiswick Fulham Brentford Putney Kew
 But of extravagance he neer was cured
 And when both died as mortal men will do
 Twas commonly reported that the steward
 Was very much the richer of the two




THE WHITE SQUALL


 On deck beneath the awning
 I dozing lay and yawning
 It was the gray of dawning
 Ere yet the sun arose
 And above the funnels roaring
 And the fitful winds deploring
 I heard the cabin snoring
 With universal nose
 I could hear the passengers snorting
 I envied their disporting
 Vainly I was courting
 The pleasure of a doze

 So I lay and wondered why light
 Came not and watched the twilight
 And the glimmer of the skylight
 That shot across the deck
 And the binnacle pale and steady
 And the dull glimpse of the deadeye
 And the sparks in fiery eddy
 That whirled from the chimney neck
 In our jovial floating prison
 There was sleep from fore to mizzen
 And never a star had risen
 The hazy sky to speck

 Strange company we harbored
 Wed a hundred Jews to larboard
 Unwashed uncombed unbarbered
 Jews black and brown and gray
 With terror it would seize ye
 And make your souls uneasy
 To see those Rabbis greasy
 Who did naught but scratch and pray
 Their dirty children puking
 Their dirty saucepans cooking
 Their dirty fingers hooking
 Their swarming fleas away

 To starboard Turks and Greeks were
 Whiskered and brown their cheeks were
 Enormous wide their breeks were
 Their pipes did puff alway
 Each on his mat allotted
 In silence smoked and squatted
 Whilst round their children trotted
 In pretty pleasant play
 He cant but smile who traces
 The smiles on those brown faces
 And the pretty prattling graces
 Of those small heathens gay

 And so the hours kept tolling
 And through the ocean rolling
 Went the brave Iberia bowling
 Before the break of day

 When A SQUALL upon a sudden
 Came oer the waters scudding
 And the clouds began to gather
 And the sea was lashed to lather
 And the lowering thunder grumbled
 And the lightning jumped and tumbled
 And the ship and all the ocean
 Woke up in wild commotion
 Then the wind set up a howling
 And the poodle dog a yowling
 And the cocks began a crowing
 And the old cow raised a lowing
 As she heard the tempest blowing
 And fowls and geese did cackle
 And the cordage and the tackle
 Began to shriek and crackle
 And the spray dashed oer the funnels
 And down the deck in runnels
 And the rushing water soaks all
 From the seamen in the foksal
 To the stokers whose black faces
 Peer out of their bedplaces
 And the captain he was bawling
 And the sailors pulling hauling
 And the quarterdeck tarpauling
 Was shivered in the squalling
 And the passengers awaken
 Most pitifully shaken
 And the steward jumps up and hastens
 For the necessary basins

 Then the Greeks they groaned and quivered
 And they knelt and moaned and shivered
 As the plunging waters met them
 And splashed and overset them
 And they call in their emergence
 Upon countless saints and virgins
 And their marrowbones are bended
 And they think the world is ended

 And the Turkish women forard
 Were frightened and behorrord
 And shrieking and bewildering
 The mothers clutched their children
 The men sung Allah Illah
 Mashallah Bismillah
 As the warring waters doused them
 And splashed them and soused them
 And they called upon the Prophet
 And thought but little of it

 Then all the fleas in Jewry
 Jumped up and bit like fury
 And the progeny of Jacob
 Did on the maindeck wake up
 I wot those greasy Rabbins
 Would never pay for cabins
 And each man moaned and jabbered in
 His filthy Jewish gaberdine
 In woe and lamentation
 And howling consternation
 And the splashing water drenches
 Their dirty brats and wenches
 And they crawl from bales and benches
 In a hundred thousand stenches

 This was the White Squall famous
 Which latterly oercame us
 And which all will well remember
 On the 28th September
 When a Prussian captain of Lancers
 Those tightlaced whiskered prancers
 Came on the deck astonished
 By that wild squall admonished
 And wondering cried Potztausend
 Wie ist der Stuerm jetzt brausend
 And looked at Captain Lewis
 Who calmly stood and blew his
 Cigar in all the hustle
 And scorned the tempests tussle
 And oft weve thought thereafter
 How he beat the storm to laughter
 For well he knew his vessel
 With that vain wind could wrestle
 And when a wreck we thought her
 And doomed ourselves to slaughter
 How gayly he fought her
 And through the hubbub brought her
 And as the tempest caught her
 Cried GEORGE SOME BRANDYANDWATER

 And when its force expended
 The harmless storm was ended
 And as the sunrise splendid
 Came blushing oer the sea
 I thought as day was breaking
 My little girls were waking
 And smiling and making
 A prayer at home for me

PEG OF LIMAVADDY


 Riding from Coleraine
 Famed for lovely Kitty
 Came a Cockney bound
 Unto Derry city
 Weary was his soul
 Shivering and sad he
 Bumped along the road
 Leads to Limavaddy

 Mountains stretchd around
 Gloomy was their tinting
 And the horses hoofs
 Made a dismal clinting
 Wind upon the heath
 Howling was and piping
 On the heath and bog
 Black with many a snipe in
 Mid the bogs of black
 Silver pools were flashing
 Crows upon their sides
 Picking were and splashing
 Cockney on the car
 Closer folds his plaidy
 Grumbling at the road
 Leads to Limavaddy

 Through the crashing woods
 Autumn brawld and blusterd
 Tossing round about
 Leaves the hue of mustard
 Yonder lay Lough Foyle
 Which a storm was whipping
 Covering with mist
 Lake and shores and shipping
 Up and down the hill
 Nothing could be bolder
 Horse went with a raw
 Bleeding on his shoulder
 Where are horses changed
 Said I to the laddy
 Driving on the box
 Sir at Limavaddy

 Limavaddy inns
 But a humble baithouse
 Where you may procure
 Whiskey and potatoes
 Landlord at the door
 Gives a smiling welcome
 To the shivering wights
 Who to his hotel come

 Landlady within
 Sits and knits a stocking
 With a wary foot
 Babys cradle rocking
 To the chimney nook
 Having found admittance
 There I watch a pup
 Playing with two kittens
 Playing round the fire
 Which of blazing turf is
 Roaring to the pot
 Which bubbles with the murphies
 And the cradled babe
 Fond the mother nursed it
 Singing it a song
 As she twists the worsted

 Up and down the stair
 Two more young ones patter
 Twins were never seen
 Dirtier nor fatter
 Both have mottled legs
 Both have snubby noses
 Both have Here the host
 Kindly interposes
 Sure you must be froze
 With the sleet and hail sir
 So will you have some punch
 Or will you have some ale sir

 Presently a maid
 Enters with the liquor
 Half a pint of ale
 Frothing in a beaker
 Gads didnt know
 What my beating heart meant
 Hebes self I thought
 Entered the apartment
 As she came she smiled
 And the smile bewitching
 On my word and honor
 Lighted all the kitchen

 With a curtsy neat
 Greeting the new comer
 Lovely smiling Peg
 Offers me the rummer
 But my trembling hand
 Up the beaker tilted
 And the glass of ale
 Every drop I spilt it
 Spilt it every drop
 Dames who read my volumes
 Pardon such a word
 On my whatdyecallems

 Witnessing the sight
 Of that dire disaster
 Out began to laugh
 Missis maid and master
 Such a merry peal
 Specially Miss Pegs was
 As the glass of ale
 Trickling down my legs was
 That the joyful sound
 Of that mingling laughter
 Echoed in my ears
 Many a long day after

 Such a silver peal
 In the meadows listening
 You whove heard the bells
 Ringing to a christening
 You who ever heard
 Caradori pretty
 Smiling like an angel
 Singing Giovinetti
 Fancy Peggys laugh
 Sweet and clear and cheerful
 At my pantaloons
 With half a pint of beer full

 When the laugh was done
 Peg the pretty hussy
 Moved about the room
 Wonderfully busy
 Now she looks to see
 If the kettle keep hot
 Now she rubs the spoons
 Now she cleans the teapot
 Now she sets the cups
 Trimly and secure
 Now she scours a pot
 And so it was I drew her

 Thus it was I drew her
 Scouring of a kettle
 Faith her blushing cheeks
 Reddend on the metal
 Ah but tis in vain
 That I try to sketch it
 The pot perhaps is like
 But Peggys face is wretched
 No the best of lead
 And of indianrubber
 Never could depict
 That sweet kettlescrubber

 See her as she moves
 Scarce the ground she touches
 Airy as a fay
 Graceful as a duchess
 Bare her rounded arm
 Bare her little leg is
 Vestris never showd
 Ankles like to Peggys
 Braided is her hair
 Soft her look and modest
 Slim her little waist
 Comfortably bodiced

 This I do declare
 Happy is the laddy
 Who the heart can share
 Of Peg of Limavaddy
 Married if she were
 Blest would be the daddy
 Of the children fair
 Of Peg of Limavaddy
 Beauty is not rare
 In the land of Paddy
 Fair beyond compare
 Is Peg of Limavaddy

 Citizen or Squire
 Tory Whig or Radi
 cal would all desire
 Peg of Limavaddy
 Had I Homers fire
 Or that of Serjeant Taddy
 Meetly Id admire
 Peg of Limavaddy
 And till I expire
 Or till I grow mad I
 Will sing unto my lyre
 Peg of Limavaddy




MAYDAY ODE


 But yesterday a naked sod
 The dandies sneered from Rotten Row
 And cantered oer it to and fro
 And see tis done
 As though twere by a wizards rod
 A blazing arch of lucid glass
 Leaps like a fountain from the grass
 To meet the sun

 A quiet green but few days since
 With cattle browsing in the shade
 And here are lines of bright arcade
 In order raised
 A palace as for fairy Prince
 A rare pavilion such as man
 Saw never since mankind began
 And built and glazed

 A peaceful place it was but now
 And lo within its shining streets
 A multitude of nations meets
 A countless throng
 I see beneath the crystal bow
 And Gaul and German Russ and Turk
 Each with his native handiwork
 And busy tongue

 I felt a thrill of love and awe
 To mark the different garb of each
 The changing tongue the various speech
 Together blent
 A thrill methinks like His who saw
 All people dwelling upon earth
 Praising our God with solemn mirth
 And one consent

 High Sovereign in your Royal state
 Captains and chiefs and councillors
 Before the lofty palace doors
 Are open set
 Hush ere you pass the shining gate
 Hush ere the heaving curtain draws
 And let the Royal pageant pause
 A moment yet

 People and prince a silence keep
 Bow coronet and kingly crown
 Helmet and plume bow lowly down
 The while the priest
 Before the splendid portal step
 While still the wondrous banquet stays
 From Heaven supreme a blessing prays
 Upon the feast

 Then onwards let the triumph march
 Then let the loud artillery roll
 And trumpets ring and joybells toll
 And pass the gate
 Pass underneath the shining arch
 Neath which the leafy elms are green
 Ascend unto your throne O Queen
 And take your state

 Behold her in her Royal place
 A gentle lady and the hand
 That sways the sceptre of this land
 How frail and weak
 Soft is the voice and fair the face
 She breathes amen to prayer and hymn
 No wonder that her eyes are dim
 And pale her cheek

 This moment round her empires shores
 The winds of Austral winter sweep
 And thousands lie in midnight sleep
 At rest today
 Oh awful is that crown of yours
 Queen of innumerable realms
 Sitting beneath the budding elms
 Of English May

 A wondrous scepter tis to bear
 Strange mystery of God which set
 Upon her brow yon coronet
 The foremost crown
 Of all the world on one so fair
 That chose her to it from her birth
 And bade the sons of all the earth
 To her bow down

 The representatives of man
 Here from the far Antipodes
 And from the subject Indian seas
 In Congress meet
 From Afric and from Hindustan
 From Western continent and isle
 The envoys of her empire pile
 Gifts at her feet

 Our brethren cross the Atlantic tides
 Loading the gallant decks which once
 Roared a defiance to our guns
 With peaceful store
 Symbol of peace their vessel rides
 Oer English waves float Star and Stripe
 And firm their friendly anchors gripe
 The father shore

 From Rhine and Danube Rhone and Seine
 As rivers from their sources gush
 The swelling floods of nations rush
 And seaward pour
 From coast to coast in friendly chain
 With countless ships we bridge the straits
 And angry ocean separates
 Europe no more

 From Mississippi and from Nile
 From Baltic Ganges Bosphorous
 In Englands ark assembled thus
 Are friend and guest
 Look down the mighty sunlit aisle
 And see the sumptuous banquet set
 The brotherhood of nations met
 Around the feast

 Along the dazzling colonnade
 Far as the straining eye can gaze
 Gleam cross and fountain bell and vase
 In vistas bright
 And statues fair of nymph and maid
 And steeds and pards and Amazons
 Writhing and grappling in the bronze
 In endless fight

 To deck the glorious roof and dome
 To make the Queen a canopy
 The peaceful hosts of industry
 Their standards bear
 Yon are the works of Brahmin loom
 On such a web of Persian thread
 The desert Arab bows his head
 And cries his prayer

 Look yonder where the engines toil
 These Englands arms of conquest are
 The trophies of her bloodless war
 Brave weapons these
 Victorians over wave and soil
 With these she sails she weaves she tills
 Pierces the everlasting hills
 And spans the seas

 The engine roars upon its race
 The shuttle whirs the woof
 The people hum from floor to roof
 With Babel tongue
 The fountain in the basin plays
 The chanting organ echoes clear
 An awful chorus tis to hear
 A wondrous song

 Swell organ swell your trumpet blast
 March Queen and Royal pageant march
 By splendid aisle and springing arch
 Of this fair Hall
 And see above the fabric vast
 Gods boundless Heaven is bending blue
 Gods peaceful sunlights beaming through
 And shines oer all

THE BALLAD OF BOUILLABAISSE


 A street there is in Paris famous
 For which no rhyme our language yields
 Rue Neuve des Petits Champs its name is
 The New Street of the Little Fields
 And heres an inn not rich and splendid
 But still in comfortable case
 The which in youth I oft attended
 To eat a bowl of Bouillabaisse

 This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is
 A sort of soup or broth or brew
 Or hotchpotch of all sorts of fishes
 That Greenwich never could outdo
 Green herbs red peppers mussels saffron
 Soles onions garlic roach and dace
 All these you eat at TERRES tavern
 In that one dish of Bouillabaisse

 Indeed a rich and savory stew tis
 And true philosophers methinks
 Who love all sorts of natural beauties
 Should love good victuals and good drinks
 And Cordelier or Benedictine
 Might gladly sure his lot embrace
 Nor find a fastday too afflicting
 Which served him up a Bouillabaisse

 I wonder if the house still there is
 Yes here the lamp is as before
 The smiling redchecked ecaillere is
 Still opening oysters at the door
 Is TERRE still alive and able
 I recollect his droll grimace
 Hed come and smile before your table
 And hope you liked your Bouillabaisse

 We enternothings changed or older
 Hows Monsieur TERRE waiter pray
 The waiter stares and shrugs his shoulder
 Monsieur is dead this many a day
 It is the lot of saint and sinner
 So honest TERRES run his race
 What will Monsieur require for dinner
 Say do you still cook Bouillabaisse

 Oh oui Monsieur s the waiters answer
 Quel vin Monsieur desiretil
 Tell me a good oneThat I can Sir
 The Chambertin with yellow seal
 So TERRES gone I say and sink in
 My old accustomd cornerplace
 Hes done with feasting and with drinking
 With Burgundy and Bouillabaisse

 My old accustomd corner here is
 The table still is in the nook
 Ah vanishd many a busy year is
 This wellknown chair since last I took
 When first I saw ye cari luoghi
 Id scarce a beard upon my face
 And now a grizzled grim old fogy
 I sit and wait for Bouillabaisse

 Where are you old companions trusty
 Of early days here met to dine
 Come waiter quick a flagon crusty
 Ill pledge them in the good old wine
 The kind old voices and old faces
 My memory can quick retrace
 Around the board they take their places
 And share the wine and Bouillabaisse

 Theres JACK has made a wondrous marriage
 Theres laughing TOM is laughing yet
 Theres brave AUGUSTUS drives his carriage
 Theres poor old FRED in the Gazette
 On JAMESS head the grass is growing
 Good Lord the world has wagged apace
 Since here we set the Claret flowing
 And drank and ate the Bouillabaisse

 Ah me how quick the days are flitting
 I mind me of a time thats gone
 When here Id sit as now Im sitting
 In this same placebut not alone
 A fair young form was nestled near me
 A dear dear face looked fondly up
 And sweetly spoke and smiled to cheer me
 Theres no one now to share my cup

     

 I drink it as the Fates ordain it
 Come fill it and have done with rhymes
 Fill up the lonely glass and drain it
 In memory of dear old times
 Welcome the wine whateer the seal is
 And sit you down and say your grace
 With thankful heart whateer the meal is
 Here comes the smoking Bouillabaisse




THE MAHOGANY TREE


 Christmas is here
 Winds whistle shrill
 Icy and chill
 Little care we
 Little we fear
 Weather without
 Sheltered about
 The Mahogany Tree

 Once on the boughs
 Birds of rare plume
 Sang in its bloom
 Nightbirds are we
 Here we carouse
 Singing like them
 Perched round the stem
 Of the jolly old tree

 Here let us sport
 Boys as we sit
 Laughter and wit
 Flashing so free
 Life is but short
 When we are gone
 Let them sing on
 Round the old tree

 Evenings we knew
 Happy as this
 Faces we miss
 Pleasant to see
 Kind hearts and true
 Gentle and just
 Peace to your dust
 We sing round the tree

 Care like a dun
 Lurks at the gate
 Let the dog wait
 Happy well be
 Drink every one
 Pile up the coals
 Fill the red bowls
 Round the old tree

 Drain we the cup
 Friend art afraid
 Spirits are laid
 In the Red Sea
 Mantle it up
 Empty it yet
 Let us forget
 Round the old tree

 Sorrows begone
 Life and its ills
 Duns and their bills
 Bid we to flee
 Come with the dawn
 Bluedevil sprite
 Leave us tonight
 Round the old tree




THE YANKEE VOLUNTEERS


 A surgeon of the United States army says that on inquiring of
 the Captain of his company he found that NINETENTHS of the men
 had enlisted on account of some female difficultyMorning Paper


 Ye Yankee Volunteers
 It makes my bosom bleed
 When I your story read
 Though oft tis told one
 Soin both hemispheres
 The women are untrue
 And cruel in the New
 As in the Old one

 Whatin this company
 Of sixty sons of Mars
 Who march neath Stripes and Stars
 With fife and horn
 Ninetenths of all we see
 Along the warlike line
 Had but one cause to join
 This Hope Forlorn

 Deserters from the realm
 Where tyrant Venus reigns
 You slippd her wicked chains
 Fled and outran her
 And now with sword and helm
 Together banded are
 Beneath the Stripe and Star
 Embroiderd banner

 And is it so with all
 The warriors ranged in line
 With lace bedizend fine
 And swords goldhilted
 Yon lusty corporal
 Yon colorman who gripes
 The flag of Stars and Stripes
 Has each been jilted

 Come each man of this line
 The privates strong and tall
 The pioneers and all
 The fifer nimble
 Lieutenant and Ensign
 Captain with epaulets
 And Blacky there who beats
 The clanging cymbal

 O cymbalbeating black
 Tell us as thou canst feel
 Was it some Lucy Neal
 Who caused thy ruin
 O nimble fifing Jack
 And drummer making din
 So deftly on the skin
 With thy rattattooing

 Confess ye volunteers
 Lieutenant and Ensign
 And Captain of the line
 As bold as Roman
 Confess ye grenadiers
 However strong and tall
 The Conqueror of you all
 Is Woman Woman

 No corselet is so proof
 But through it from her bow
 The shafts that she can throw
 Will pierce and rankle
 No champion eer so tough
 Buts in the struggle thrown
 And trippd and trodden down
 By her slim ankle

 Thus always it was ruled
 And when a woman smiled
 The strong man was a child
 The sage a noodle
 Alcides was befoold
 And silly Samson shorn
 Long long ere you were horn
 Poor Yankee Doodle




THE PEN AND THE ALBUM


 I am Miss Catherines book the album speaks
 Ive lain among your tomes these many weeks
 Im tired of their old coats and yellow cheeks

 Quick Pen and write a line with a good grace
 Come draw me off a funny little face
 And prithee send me back to Chesham Place

 PEN

 I am my masters faithful old Gold Pen
 Ive served him three long years and drawn since then
 Thousands of funny women and droll men

 O Album could I tell you all his ways
 And thoughts since I am his these thousand days
 Lord how your pretty pages Id amaze

 ALBUM

 His ways his thoughts Just whisper me a few
 Tell me a curious anecdote or two
 And write em quickly off good Mordan do

 PEN

 Since he my faithful service did engage
 To follow him through his queer pilgrimage
 Ive drawn and written many a line and page

 Caricatures I scribbled have and rhymes
 And dinnercards and picture pantomimes
 And merry little childrens books at times

 Ive writ the foolish fancy of his brain
 The aimless jest that striking hath caused pain
 The idle word that hed wish back again

      

 Ive helpd him to pen many a line for bread
 To joke with sorrow aching in his head
 And make your laughter when his own heart bled

 Ive spoke with men of all degree and sort
 Peers of the land and ladies of the Court
 Oh but Ive chronicled a deal of sport

 Feasts that were ate a thousand days ago
 Biddings to wine that long hath ceased to flow
 Gay meetings with good fellows long laid low

 Summons to bridal banquet burial ball
 Tradesmans polite reminders of his small
 Account due Christmas lastIve answered all

 Poor Diddlers tenth petition for a half
 Guinea Miss Bunyans for an autograph
 So I refuse accept lament or laugh

 Condole congratulate invite praise scoff
 Day after day still dipping in my trough
 And scribbling pages after pages off

 Day after day the labors to be done
 And sure as comes the postman and the sun
 The indefatigable ink must run

     

 Go back my pretty little gilded tome
 To a fair mistress and a pleasant home
 Where soft hearts greet us whensoeer we come

 Dear friendly eyes with constant kindness lit
 However rude my verse or poor my wit
 Or sad or gay my mood you welcome it

 Kind lady till my last of lines is pennd
 My masters love grief laughter at an end
 Wheneer I write your name may I write friend

 Not all are so that were so in past years
 Voices familiar once no more he hears
 Names often writ are blotted out in tears

 So be itjoys will end and tears will dry
 Album my master bids me wish goodby
 Hell send you to your mistress presently

 And thus with thankful heart he closes you
 Blessing the happy hour when a friend he knew
 So gentle and so generous and so true

 Nor pass the words as idle phrases by
 Stranger I never writ a flattery
 Nor signd the page that registerd a lie




MRS KATHERINES LANTERN

 WRITTEN IN A LADYS ALBUM


 Coming from a gloomy court
 Place of Israelite resort
 This old lamp Ive brought with me
 Madam on its panes youll see
 The initials K and E

 An old lantern brought to me
 Ugly dingy battered black
 Here a lady I suppose
 Turning up a pretty nose
 Pray sir take the old thing back
 Ive no taste for bricabrac

 Please to mark the letters twain
 Im supposed to speak again
 Graven on the lantern pane
 Can you tell me who was she
 Mistress of the flowery wreath
 And the anagram beneath
 The mysterious K E

 Full a hundred years are gone
 Since the little beacon shone
 From a Venice balcony
 There on summer nights it hung
 And her Lovers came and sung
 To their beautiful K E

 Hush in the canal below
 Dont you hear the plash of oars
 Underneath the lanterns glow
 And a thrilling voice begins
 To the sound of mandolins
 Begins singing of amore
 And delire and dolore
 O the ravishing tenore

 Lady do you know the tune
 Ah we all of us have hummed it
 Ive an old guitar has thrummed it
 Under many a changing moon
 Shall I try it Do Re MI  
 What is this Ma foi the fact is
 That my hand is out of practice
 And my poor old fiddle cracked is
 And a manI let the truth out
 Whos had almost every tooth out
 Cannot sing as once he sung
 When he was young as you are young
 When he was young and lutes were strung
 And lovelamps in the casement hung




LUCYS BIRTHDAY


 Seventeen rosebuds in a ring
 Thick with sister flowers beset
 In a fragrant coronet
 Lucys servants this day bring
 Be it the birthday wreath she wears
 Fresh and fair and symbolling
 The young number of her years
 The sweet blushes of her spring

 Types of youth and love and hope
 Friendly hearts your mistress greet
 Be you ever fair and sweet
 And grow lovelier as you ope
 Gentle nursling fenced about
 With fond care and guarded so
 Scarce youve heard of storms without
 Frosts that bite or winds that blow

 Kindly has your life begun
 And we pray that heaven may send
 To our floweret a warm sun
 A calm summer a sweet end
 And whereer shall be her home
 May she decorate the place
 Still expanding into bloom
 And developing in grace




THE CANEBOTTOMD CHAIR


 In tattered old slippers that toast at the bars
 And a ragged old jacket perfumed with cigars
 Away from the world and its toils and its cares
 Ive a snug little kingdom up four pair of stairs

 To mount to this realm is a toil to be sure
 But the fire there is bright and the air rather pure
 And the view I behold on a sunshiny day
 Is grand through the chimneypots over the way

 This snug little chamber is crammd in all nooks
 With worthless old knickknacks and silly old books
 And foolish old odds and foolish old ends
 Crackd bargains from brokers cheap keepsakes from friends

 Old armor prints pictures pipes china all crackd
 Old rickety tables and chairs brokenbacked
 A twopenny treasury wondrous to see
 What matter tis pleasant to you friend and me

 No better divan need the Sultan require
 Than the creaking old sofa that basks by the fire
 And tis wonderful surely what music you get
 From the rickety ramshackle wheezy spinet

 That prayingrug came from a Turcomans camp
 By Tiber once twinkled that brazen old lamp
 A mameluke fierce yonder dagger has drawn
 Tis a murderous knife to toast muffins upon

 Long long through the hours and the night and the chimes
 Here we talk of old books and old friends and old times
 As we sit in a fog made of rich Latakie
 This chamber is pleasant to you friend and me

 But of all the cheap treasures that garnish my nest
 Theres one that I love and I cherish the best
 For the finest of couches thats padded with hair
 I never would change thee my canebottomd chair

 Tis a bandyleggd highshoulderd wormeaten seat
 With a creaking old back and twisted old feet
 But since the fair morning when Fanny sat there
 I bless thee and love thee old canebottomd chair

 If chairs have but feeling in holding such charms
 A thrill must have passd through your witherd old arms
 I lookd and I longd and I wishd in despair
 I wishd myself turnd to a canebottomd chair

 It was but a moment she sat in this place
 Shed a scarf on her neck and a smile on her face
 A smile on her face and a rose in her hair
 And she sat there and bloomd in my canebottomd chair

 And so I have valued my chair ever since
 Like the shrine of a saint or the throne of a prince
 Saint Fanny my patroness sweet I declare
 The queen of my heart and my canebottomd chair

 When the candles burn low and the companys gone
 In the silence of night as I sit here alone
 I sit here alone but we yet are a pair
 My Fanny I see in my canebottomd chair

 She comes from the past and revisits my room
 She looks as she then did all beauty and bloom
 So smiling and tender so fresh and so fair
 And yonder she sits in my canebottomd chair




PISCATOR AND PISCATRIX

 LINES WRITTEN TO AN ALBUM PRINT


 As on this pictured page I look
 This pretty tale of line and hook
 As though it were a novelbook
 Amuses and engages
 I know them both the boy and girl
 She is the daughter of the Earl
 The lad that has his hair in curl
 My lord the Countys page has

 A pleasant place for such a pair
 The fields lie basking in the glare
 No breath of wind the heavy air
 Of lazy summer quickens
 Hard by you see the castle tall
 The village nestles round the wall
 As round about the hen its small
 Young progeny of chickens

 It is too hot to pace the keep
 To climb the turret is too steep
 My lord the earl is dozing deep
 His noonday dinner over
 The posternwarder is asleep
 Perhaps theyve bribed him not to peep
 And so from out the gate they creep
 And cross the fields of clover

 Their lines into the brook they launch
 He lays his cloak upon a branch
 To guarantee his Lady Blanche
 s delicate complexion
 He takes his rapier from his haunch
 That beardless doughty champion staunch
 Hed drill it through the rivals paunch
 That questiond his affection

 O heedless pair of sportsmen slack
 You never mark though trout or jack
 Or little foolish stickleback
 Your baited snares may capture
 What care has SHE for line and hook
 She turns her back upon the brook
 Upon her lovers eyes to look
 In sentimental rapture

 O loving pair as thus I gaze
 Upon the girl who smiles always
 The little hand that ever plays
 Upon the lovers shoulder
 In looking at your pretty shapes
 A sort of envious wish escapes
 Such as the Fox had for the Grapes
 The Poet your beholder

 To be brave handsome twentytwo
 With nothing else on earth to do
 But all day long to bill and coo
 It were a pleasant calling
 And had I such a partner sweet
 A tender heart for mine to beat
 A gentle hand my clasp to meet
 Id let the world flow at my feet
 And never heed its brawling




THE ROSE UPON MY BALCONY


 The rose upon my balcony the morning air perfuming
 Was leafless all the winter time and pining for the spring
 You ask me why her breath is sweet and why her cheek is blooming
 It is because the sun is out and birds begin to sing

 The nightingale whose melody is through the greenwood ringing
 Was silent when the boughs were bare and winds were blowing keen
 And if Mamma you ask of me the reason of his singing
 It is because the sun is out and all the leaves are green

 Thus each performs his part Mamma the birds have found their voices
 The blowing rose a flush Mamma her bonny cheek to dye
 And theres sunshine in my heart Mamma which wakens and rejoices
 And so I sing and blush Mamma and thats the reason why




RONSARD TO HIS MISTRESS


 Quand vous serez bien vielle le soir a la chandelle
 Assise aupres du feu devisant et filant
 Direz chantant mes vers en vous esmerveillant
 Ronsard ma celebre du temps que jetois belle


 Some winter night shut snugly in
 Beside the fagot in the hall
 I think I see you sit and spin
 Surrounded by your maidens all
 Old tales are told old songs are sung
 Old days come back to memory
 You say When I was fair and young
 A poet sang of me

 Theres not a maiden in your hall
 Though tired and sleepy ever so
 But wakes as you my name recall
 And longs the history to know
 And as the piteous tale is said
 Of lady cold and lover true
 Each musing carries it to bed
 And sighs and envies you

 Our ladys old and feeble now
 Theyll say she once was fresh and fair
 And yet she spurnd her lovers vow
 And heartless left him to despair
 The lover lies in silent earth
 No kindly mate the lady cheers
 She sits beside a lonely hearth
 With threescore and ten years

 Ah dreary thoughts and dreams are those
 But wherefore yield me to despair
 While yet the poets bosom glows
 While yet the dame is peerless fair
 Sweet lady mine while yet tis time
 Requite my passion and my truth
 And gather in their blushing prime
 The roses of your youth




AT THE CHURCH GATE


 Although I enter not
 Yet round about the spot
 Ofttimes I hover
 And near the sacred gate
 With longing eyes I wait
 Expectant of her

 The Minster bell tolls out
 Above the citys rout
 And noise and humming
 Theyve hushd the Minster bell
 The organ gins to swell
 Shes coming shes coming

 My lady comes at last
 Timid and stepping fast
 And hastening hither
 With modest eyes downcast
 She comesshes hereshes past
 May heaven go with her

 Kneel undisturbd fair Saint
 Pour out your praise or plaint
 Meekly and duly
 I will not enter there
 To sully your pure prayer
 With thoughts unruly

 But suffer me to pace
 Round the forbidden place
 Lingering a minute
 Like outcast spirits who wait
 And see through heavens gate
 Angels within it




THE AGE OF WISDOM


 Ho pretty page with the dimpled chin
 That never has known the Barbers shear
 All your wish is woman to win
 This is the way that boys begin
 Wait till you come to Forty Year

 Curly gold locks cover foolish brains
 Billing and cooing is all your cheer
 Sighing and singing of midnight strains
 Under Bonnybells window panes
 Wait till you come to Forty Year

 Forty times over let Michaelmas pass
 Grizzling hair the brain doth clear
 Then you know a boy is an ass
 Then you know the worth of a lass
 Once you have come to Forty Year

 Pledge me round I bid ye declare
 All good fellows whose beards are gray
 Did not the fairest of the fair
 Common grow and wearisome ere
 Ever a month was passed away

 The reddest lips that ever have kissed
 The brightest eyes that ever have shone
 May pray and whisper and we not list
 Or look away and never be missed
 Ere yet ever a month is gone

 Gillians dead God rest her bier
 How I loved her twenty years syne
 Marians married but I sit here
 Alone and merry at Forty Year
 Dipping my nose in the Gascon wine




SORROWS OF WERTHER


 WERTHER had a love for Charlotte
 Such as words could never utter
 Would you know how first he met her
 She was cutting bread and butter

 Charlotte was a married lady
 And a moral man was Werther
 And for all the wealth of Indies
 Would do nothing for to hurt her

 So he sighed and pined and ogled
 And his passion boiled and bubbled
 Till he blew his silly brains out
 And no more was by it troubled

 Charlotte having seen his body
 Borne before her on a shutter
 Like a wellconducted person
 Went on cutting bread and butter




A DOE IN THE CITY


 Little KITTY LORIMER
 Fair and young and witty
 What has brought your ladyship
 Rambling to the City

 All the Stags in Capel Court
 Saw her lightly trip it
 All the lads of Stock Exchange
 Twiggd her muff and tippet

 With a sweet perplexity
 And a mystery pretty
 Threading through Threadneedle Street
 Trots the little KITTY

 What was my astonishment
 What was my compunction
 When she reached the Offices
 Of the Didland Junction

 Up the Didland stairs she went
 To the Didland door Sir
 Porters lost in wonderment
 Let her pass before Sir

 Madam says the old chief Clerk
 Sure we cant admit ye
 Wheres the Didland Junction deed
 Dauntlessly says KITTY

 If you doubt my honesty
 Look at my receipt Sir
 Up then jumps the old chief Clerk
 Smiling as he meets her

 KITTY at the table sits
 Whither the old Clerk leads her
 I deliver this she says
 As my act and deed Sir

 When I heard these funny words
 Come from lips so pretty
 This I thought should surely be
 Subject for a ditty

 What are ladies stagging it
 Sure the mores the pity
 But Ive lost my heart to her
 Naughty little KITTY




THE LAST OF MAY

 IN REPLY TO AN INVITATION DATED ON THE 1ST


 By fates benevolent award
 Should I survive the day
 Ill drink a bumper with my lord
 Upon the last of May

 That I may reach that happy time
 The kindly gods I pray
 For are not ducks and pease in prime
 Upon the last of May

 At thirty boards twixt now and then
 My knife and fork shall play
 But better wine and better men
 I shall not meet in May

 And though good friend with whom I dine
 Your honest head is gray
 And like this grizzled head of mine
 Has seen its last of May

 Yet with a heart thats ever kind
 A gentle spirit gay
 Youve spring perennial in your mind
 And round you make a May




AH BLEAK AND BARREN WAS THE MOOR


 Ah bleak and barren was the moor
 Ah loud and piercing was the storm
 The cottage roof was shelterd sure
 The cottage hearth was bright and warm
 An orphanboy the lattice passd
 And as he markd its cheerful glow
 Felt doubly keen the midnight blast
 And doubly cold the fallen snow

 They marked him as he onward pressd
 With fainting heart and weary limb
 Kind voices bade him turn and rest
 And gentle faces welcomed him
 The dawn is upthe guest is gone
 The cottage hearth is blazing still
 Heaven pity all poor wanderers lone
 Hark to the wind upon the hill




SONG OF THE VIOLET


 A humble flower long time I pined
 Upon the solitary plain
 And trembled at the angry wind
 And shrunk before the bitter rain
 And oh twas in a blessed hour
 A passing wanderer chanced to see
 And pitying the lonely flower
 To stoop and gather me

 I fear no more the tempest rude
 On dreary heath no more I pine
 But left my cheerless solitude
 To deck the breast of Caroline
 Alas our days are brief at best
 Nor long I fear will mine endure
 Though shelterd here upon a breast
 So gentle and so pure

 It draws the fragrance from my leaves
 It robs me of my sweetest breath
 And every time it falls and heaves
 It warns me of my coming death
 But one I know would glad forego
 All joys of life to be as I
 An hour to rest on that sweet breast
 And then contented die




FAIRY DAYS


 Beside the old hallfireupon my nurses knee
 Of happy fairy dayswhat tales were told to me
 I thought the world was onceall peopled with princesses
 And my heart would beat to heartheir loves and their distresses
 And many a quiet nightin slumber sweet and deep
 The pretty fairy peoplewould visit me in sleep

 I saw them in my dreamscome flying east and west
 With wondrous fairy giftsthe newborn babe they blessd
 One has brought a jeweland one a crown of gold
 And one has brought a cursebut she is wrinkled and old
 The gentle queen turns paleto hear those words of sin
 But the king he only laughsand bids the dance begin

 The babe has grown to bethe fairest of the land
 And rides the forest greena hawk upon her hand
 An ambling palfrey whitea golden robe and crown
 Ive seen her in my dreamsriding up and down
 And heard the ogre laughas she fell into his snare
 At the little tender creaturewho wept and tore her hair

 But ever when it seemedher need was at the sorest
 A prince in shining mailcomes prancing through the forest
 A waving ostrichplumea buckler burnished bright
 Ive seen him in my dreamsgood sooth a gallant knight
 His lips are coral redbeneath a dark moustache
 See how he waves his handand how his blue eyes flash

 Come forth thou Paynim knighthe shouts in accents clear
 The giant and the maidboth tremble his voice to hear
 Saint Mary guard him wellhe draws his falchion keen
 The giant and the knightare fighting on the green
 I see them in my dreamshis blade gives stroke on stroke
 The giant pants and reelsand tumbles like an oak

 With what a blushing gracehe falls upon his knee
 And takes the ladys handand whispers You are free
 Ah happy childish talesof knight and faerie
 I waken from my dreamsbut theres neer a knight for me
 I waken from my dreamsand wish that I could be
 A child by the old hallfireupon my nurses knee




POCAHONTAS


 Wearied arm and broken sword
 Wage in vain the desperate fight
 Round him press a countless horde
 He is but a single knight
 Hark a cry of triumph shrill
 Through the wilderness resounds
 As with twenty bleeding wounds
 Sinks the warrior fighting still

 Now they heap the fatal pyre
 And the torch of death they light
 Ah tis hard to die of fire
 Who will shield the captive knight
 Round the stake with fiendish cry
 Wheel and dance the savage crowd
 Cold the victims mien and proud
 And his breast is bared to die

 Who will shield the fearless heart
 Who avert the murderous blade
 From the throng with sudden start
 See there springs an Indian maid
 Quick she stands before the knight
 Loose the chain unbind the ring
 I am daughter of the king
 And I claim the Indian right

 Dauntlessly aside she flings
 Lifted axe and thirsty knife
 Fondly to his heart she clings
 And her bosom guards his life
 In the woods of Powhattan
 Still tis told by Indian fires
 How a daughter of their sires
 Saved the captive Englishman




FROM POCAHONTAS


 Returning from the cruel fight
 How pale and faint appears my knight
 He sees me anxious at his side
 Why seek my love your wounds to hide
 Or deem your English girl afraid
 To emulate the Indian maid

 Be mine my husbands grief to cheer
 In peril to be ever near
 Whateer of ill or woe betide
 To bear it clinging at his side
 The poisoned stroke of fate to ward
 His bosom with my own to guard
 Ah could it spare a pang to his
 It could not know a purer bliss
 Twould gladden as it felt the smart
 And thank the hand that flung the dart





LOVESONGS MADE EASY




WHAT MAKES MY HEART TO THRILL AND GLOW

 THE MAYFAIR LOVESONG


 Winter and summer night and morn
 I languish at this table dark
 My office window has a corn
 er looks into St Jamess Park
 I hear the footguards buglehorn
 Their tramp upon parade I mark
 I am a gentleman forlorn
 I am a ForeignOffice Clerk

 My toils my pleasures every one
 I find are stale and dull and slow
 And yesterday when work was done
 I felt myself so sad and low
 I could have seized a sentrys gun
 My wearied brains out out to blow
 What is it makes my blood to run
 What makes my heart to beat and glow

 My notes of hand are burnt perhaps
 Some one has paid my tailors bill
 No every morn the tailor raps
 My I O Us are extant still
 I still am prey of debt and dun
 My elder brothers stout and well
 What is it makes my blood to run
 What makes my heart to glow and swell

 I know my chiefs distrust and hate
 He says Im lazy and I shirk
 Ah had I genius like the late
 Right Honorable Edmund Burke
 My chance of all promotions gone
 I know it ishe hates me so
 What is it makes my blood to run
 And all my heart to swell and glow

 Why why is all so bright and gay
 There is no change there is no cause
 My officetime I found today
 Disgusting as it ever was
 At three I went and tried the Clubs
 And yawned and saunterd to and fro
 And now my heart jumps up and throbs
 And all my soul is in a glow

 At halfpast four I had the cab
 I drove as hard as I could go
 The London sky was dirty drab
 And dirty brown the London snow
 And as I rattled in a cant
 er down by dear old Bolton Row
 A something made my heart to pant
 And caused my cheek to flush and glow

 What could it be that made me find
 Old Jawkins pleasant at the Club
 Why was it that I laughed and grinned
 At whist although I lost the rub
 What was it made me drink like mad
 Thirteen small glasses of Curaco
 That made my inmost heart so glad
 And every fibre thrill and glow

 Shes home again shes home shes home
 Away all cares and griefs and pain
 I knew she wouldshes back from Rome
 Shes home again shes home again
 The familys gone abroad they said
 September last they told me so
 Since then my lonely heart is dead
 My blood I thinks forgot to flow

 Shes home again away all care
 O fairest form the world can show
 O beaming eyes O golden hair
 O tender voice that breathes so low
 O gentlest softest purest heart
 O joy O hopeMy tiger ho
 FitzClarence said we saw him start
 He galloped down to Bolton Row




THE GHAZUL OR ORIENTAL LOVESONG

 THE ROCKS


 I was a timid little antelope
 My home was in the rocks the lonely rocks

 I saw the hunters scouring on the plain
 I lived among the rocks the lonely rocks

 I was athirsty in the summerheat
 I ventured to the tents beneath the rocks

 Zuleikah brought me water from the well
 Since then I have been faithless to the rocks

 I saw her face reflected in the well
 Her camels since have marched into the rocks

 I look to see her image in the well
 I only see my eyes my own sad eyes
 My mother is alone among the rocks




THE MERRY BARD


 ZULEIKAH The young Agas in the bazaar are slimwasted and wear
 yellow slippers I am old and hideous One of my eyes is out and
 the hairs of my beard are mostly gray Praise be to Allah I am a
 merry bard

 There is a bird upon the terrace of the Emirs chief wife Praise
 be to Allah He has emeralds on his neck and a ruby tail I am a
 merry bard He deafens me with his diabolical screaming

 There is a little brown bird in the basketmakers cage Praise be
 to Allah He ravishes my soul in the moonlight I am a merry bard

 The peacock is an Aga but the little bird is a Bulbul

 I am a little brown Bulbul Come and listen in the moonlight
 Praise be to Allah I am a merry bard




THE CAIQUE


 Yonder to the kiosk beside the creek
 Paddle the swift caique
 Thou brawny oarsman with the sunburnt cheek
 Quick for it soothes my heart to hear the Bulbul speak

 Ferry me quickly to the Asian shores
 Swift bending to your oars
 Beneath the melancholy sycamores
 Hark what a ravishing note the lovelorn Bulbul pours

 Behold the boughs seem quivering with delight
 The stars themselves more bright
 As mid the waving branches out of sight
 The Lover of the Rose sits singing through the night

 Under the boughs I sat and listened still
 I could not have my fill
 How comes I said such music to his bill
 Tell me for whom he sings so beautiful a trill

 Once I was dumb then did the Bird disclose
 But looked upon the Rose
 And in the garden where the loved one grows
 I straightway did begin sweet music to compose

 O bird of song theres one in this caique
 The Rose would also seek
 So he might learn like you to love and speak
 Then answered me the bird of dusky beak
 The Rose the Rose of Love blushes on Leilahs cheek




MY NORA


 Beneath the gold acacia buds
 My gentle Nora sits and broods
 Far far away in Boston woods
 My gentle Nora

 I see the teardrop in her ee
 Her bosoms heaving tenderly
 I knowI know she thinks of me
 My Darling Nora

 And where am I My love whilst thou
 Sittst sad beneath the acacia bough
 Where pearls on neck and wreath on brow
 I stand my Nora

 Mid carcanet and coronet
 Where joylamps shine and flowers are set
 Where Englands chivalry are met
 Behold me Nora

 In this strange scene of revelry
 Amidst this gorgeous chivalry
 A form I saw was like to thee
 My lovemy Nora

 She paused amidst her converse glad
 The lady saw that I was sad
 She pitied the poor lonely lad
 Dost love her Nora

 In sooth she is a lovely dame
 A lip of red and eye of flame
 And clustering golden locks the same
 As thine dear Nora

 Her glance is softer than the dawns
 Her foot is lighter than the fawns
 Her breast is whiter than the swans
 Or thine my Nora

 Oh gentle breast to pity me
 Oh lovely Ladye Emily
 Till deathtill death Ill think of thee
 Of thee and Nora




TO MARY


 I seem in the midst of the crowd
 The lightest of all
 My laughter rings cheery and loud
 In banquet and ball
 My lip hath its smiles and its sneers
 For all men to see
 But my soul and my truth and my tears
 Are for thee are for thee

 Around me they flatter and fawn
 The young and the old
 The fairest are ready to pawn
 Their hearts for my gold
 They sue meI laugh as I spurn
 The slaves at my knee
 But in faith and in fondness I turn
 Unto thee unto thee




SERENADE


 Now the toils of day are over
 And the sun hath sunk to rest
 Seeking like a fiery lover
 The bosom of the blushing west

 The faithful night keeps watch and ward
 Raising the moon her silver shield
 And summoning the stars to guard
 The slumbers of my fair Mathilde

 The faithful night Now all things lie
 Hid by her mantle dark and dim
 In pious hope I hither hie
 And humbly chant mine evning hymn

 Thou art my prayer my saint my shrine
 For never holy pilgrim kneeld
 Or wept at feet more pure than thine
 My virgin love my sweet Mathilde




THE MINARET BELLS


 Tinkatink tinkatink
 By the light of the star
 On the blue rivers brink
 I heard a guitar

 I heard a guitar
 On the blue waters clear
 And knew by its music
 That Selim was near

 Tinkatink tinkatink
 How the soft music swells
 And I hear the soft clink
 Of the minaret bells




COME TO THE GREENWOOD TREE


 Come to the greenwood tree
 Come where the dark woods be
 Dearest O come with me
 Let us roveO my loveO my love

 Cometis the moonlight hour
 Dew is on leaf and flower
 Come to the linden bower
 Let us roveO my loveO my love

 Dark is the wood and wide
 Dangers they say betide
 But at my Alberts side
 Nought I fear O my loveO my love

 Welcome the greenwood tree
 Welcome the forest free
 Dearest with thee with thee
 Nought I fear O my loveO my love





FIVE GERMAN DITTIES




A TRAGIC STORY

 BY ADELBERT VON CHAMISSO


 s war Einer dems zu Herzen gieng

 There lived a sage in days of yore
 And he a handsome pigtail wore
 But wondered much and sorrowed more
 Because it hung behind him

 He mused upon this curious case
 And swore hed change the pigtails place
 And have it hanging at his face
 Not dangling there behind him

 Says he The mystery Ive found
 Ill turn me roundhe turned him round
 But still it hung behind him

 Then round and round and out and in
 All day the puzzled sage did spin
 In vainit mattered not a pin
 The pigtail hung behind him

 And right and left and round about
 And up and down and in and out
 He turned but still the pigtail stout
 Hung steadily behind him

 And though his efforts never slack
 And though he twist and twirl and tack
 Alas still faithful to his back
 The pigtail hangs behind him




THE CHAPLET

 FROM UHLAND


 Es pflueckte Bluemlein mannigfalt


 A little girl through field and wood
 Went plucking flowerets here and there
 When suddenly beside her stood
 A lady wondrous fair

 The lovely lady smiled and laid
 A wreath upon the maidens brow
 Wear it twill blossom soon she said
 Although tis leafless now

 The little maiden older grew
 And wandered forth of moonlight eves
 And sighed and loved as maids will do
 When lo her wreath bore leaves

 Then was our maid a wife and hung
 Upon a joyful bridegrooms bosom
 When from the garlands leaves there sprung
 Fair store of blossom

 And presently a baby fair
 Upon her gentle breast she reared
 When midst the wreath that bound her hair
 Rich golden fruit appeared

 But when her love lay cold in death
 Sunk in the black and silent tomb
 All sere and withered was the wreath
 That wont so bright to bloom

 Yet still the withered wreath she wore
 She wore it at her dying hour
 When to the wondrous garland bore
 Both leaf and fruit and flower




THE KING ON THE TOWER

 FROM UHLAND


 Da liegen sie alle die grauen Hoehen


 The cold gray hills they bind me around
 The darksome valleys lie sleeping below
 But the winds as they pass oer all this ground
 Bring me never a sound of woe

 Oh for all I have suffered and striven
 Care has embittered my cup and my feast
 But here is the night and the dark blue heaven
 And my soul shall be at rest

 O golden legends writ in the skies
 I turn towards you with longing soul
 And list to the awful harmonies
 Of the Spheres as on they roll

 My hair is gray and my sight nigh gone
 My sword it rusteth upon the wall
 Right have I spoken and right have I done
 When shall I rest me once for all

 O blessed rest O royal night
 Wherefore seemeth the time so long
 Till I see you stars in their fullest light
 And list to their loudest song




ON A VERY OLD WOMAN

 LA MOTTE FOUQUE


 Und Du gingst einst die Myrt im Haare


 And thou wert once a maiden fair
 A blushing virgin warm and young
 With myrtles wreathed in golden hair
 And glossy brow that knew no care
 Upon a bridegrooms arm you hung

 The golden locks are silvered now
 The blushing cheek is pale and wan
 The spring may bloom the autumn glow
 Alls onein chimney corner thou
 Sittst shivering on

 A momentand thou sinkst to rest
 To wake perhaps an angel blest
 In the bright presence of thy Lord
 Oh weary is lifes path to all
 Hard is the strife and light the fall
 But wondrous the reward




A CREDO


 I

 For the sole edification
 Of this decent congregation
 Goodly people by your grant
 I will sing a holy chant
 I will sing a holy chant
 If the ditty sound but oddly
 Twas a father wise and godly
 Sang it so long ago
 Then sing as Martin Luther sang
 As Doctor Martin Luther sang
 Who loves not wine woman and song
 He is a fool his whole life long

 II

 He by custom patriarchal
 Loved to see the beaker sparkle
 And he thought the wine improved
 Tasted by the lips he loved
 By the kindly lips he loved
 Friends I wish this custom pious
 Duly were observed by us
 To combine love song wine
 And sing as Martin Luther sang
 As Doctor Martin Luther sang
 Who loves not wine woman and song
 He is a fool his whole life long

 III

 Who refuses this our Credo
 And who will not sing as we do
 Were he holy as John Knox
 Id pronounce him heterodox
 Id pronounce him heterodox
 And from out this congregation
 With a solemn commination
 Banish quick the heretic
 Who will not sing as Luther sang
 As Doctor Martin Luther sang
 Who loves not wine woman and song
 He is a fool his whole life long





FOUR IMITATIONS OF BERANGER


 LE ROI DYVETOT


 Il etait un roi dYvetot
 Peu connu dans lhistoire
 Se levant tard se couchant tot
 Dormant fort bien sans gloire
 Et couronne par Jeanneton
 Dun simple bonnet de coton
 Diton
 Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah
 Quel bon petit roi cetait la
 La la

 Il fesait ses quatre repas
 Dans son palais de chaume
 Et sur un ane pas a pas
 Parcourait son royaume
 Joyeux simple et croyant le bien
 Pour toute garde il navait rien
 Quun chien
 Oh oh oh  oh ah ah ah ah c

 Il navait de gout onereux
 Quune soif un peu vive
 Mais en rendant son peuple heureux
 Il faut bien quun roi vive
 Luimeme a table et sans suppot
 Sur chaque muid levait un pot
 Dimpot
 Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah c

 Aux filles de bonnes maisons
 Comme il avait su plaire
 Ses sujets avaient cent raisons
 De le nommer leur pere
 Dailleurs il ne levait de ban
 Que pour tirer quatre fois lan
 Au blanc
 Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah c

 Il nagrandit point ses etats
 Fut un voisin commode
 Et modele des potentats
 Prit le plaisir pour code
 Ce nest que loraquil expira
 Que le peuple qui lenterra
 Pleura
 Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah c

 On conserve encor le portrait
 De ce digne et bon prince
 Cest lenseigne dun cabaret
 Fameux dans la province
 Les jours de fete bien souvent
 La foule secrie en buvant
 Devant
 Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah c




THE KING OF YVETOT


 There was a king of Yvetot
 Of whom renown hath little said
 Who let all thoughts of glory go
 And dawdled half his days abed
 And every night as night came round
 By Jenny with a nightcap crowned
 Slept very sound
 Sing ho ho ho and he he he
 Thats the kind of king for me

 And every day it came to pass
 That four lusty meals made he
 And step by step upon an ass
 Rode abroad his realms to see
 And wherever he did stir
 What think you was his escort sir
 Why an old cur
 Sing ho ho ho  c

 If eer he went into excess
 Twas from a somewhat lively thirst
 But he who would his subjects bless
 Odds fishmust wet his whistle first
 And so from every cask they got
 Our king did to himself allot
 At least a pot
 Sing ho ho c

 To all the ladies of the land
 A courteous king and kind was he
 The reason why youll understand
 They named him Pater Patriae
 Each year he called his fighting men
 And marched a league from home and then
 Marched back again
 Sing ho ho c

 Neither by force nor false pretence
 He sought to make his kingdom great
 And made O princes learn from hence
 Live and let live his rule of state
 Twas only when he came to die
 That his people who stood by
 Were known to cry
 Sing ho ho c

 The portrait of this best of kings
 Is extant still upon a sign
 That on a village tavern swings
 Famed in the country for good wine
 The people in their Sunday trim
 Filling their glasses to the brim
 Look up to him
 Singing ha ha ha and he he he
 Thats the sort of king for me




THE KING OF BRENTFORD

 ANOTHER VERSION


 There was a king in Brentfordof whom no legends tell
 But who without his glorycould eat and sleep right well
 His Pollys cotton nightcapit was his crown of state
 He slept of evenings earlyand rose of mornings late

 All in a fine mud palaceeach day he took four meals
 And for a guard of honora dog ran at his heels
 Sometimes to view his kingdomsrode forth this monarch good
 And then a prancing jackasshe royally bestrode

 There were no costly habitswith which this king was curst
 Except and wheres the harm onta somewhat lively thirst
 But people must pay taxesand kings must have their sport
 So out of every gallonHis Grace he took a quart

 He pleased the ladies round himwith manners soft and bland
 With reason good they named himthe father of his land
 Each year his mighty armiesmarched forth in gallant show
 Their enemies were targetstheir bullets they were tow

 He vexed no quiet neighborno useless conquest made
 But by the laws of pleasurehis peaceful realm he swayed
 And in the years he reignedthrough all this country wide
 There was no cause for weepingsave when the good man died

 The faithful men of Brentforddo still their king deplore
 His portrait yet is swingingbeside an alehouse door
 And topers tenderheartedregard his honest phiz
 And envy times departedthat knew a reign like his


 LE GRENIER

 Je viens revoir lasile ou ma jeunesse
 De la misere a subi les lecons
 Javais vingt ans une folle maitresse
 De francs amis et lamour des chansons
 Bravant le monde et les sots et les sages
 Sans avenir riche de mon printemps
 Leste et joyeux je montais six etages
 Dans un grenier quon est bien a vingt ans

 Cest un grenier point ne veux quon lignore
 La fut mon lit bien chetif et bien dur
 La fut ma table et je retrouve encore
 Trois pieds dun vers charbonnes sur le mur
 Apparaissez plaisirs de mon bel age
 Que dun coup daile a fustiges le temps
 Vingt fois pour vous jai ma montre en gage
 Dans un grenier quon est bien a vingt ans

 Lisette ici doit surtout apparaitre
 Vive jolie avec un frais chapeau
 Deja sa main a letroite fenetre
 Suspend son schal en guise de rideau
 Sa robe aussi va parer ma couchette
 Respecte Amour ses plis longs et flottans
 Jai su depuis qui payait sa toilette
 Dans un grenier quon est bien a vingt ans

 A table un jour jour de grande richesse
 De mes amis les voix brillaient en choeur
 Quand jusquici monte on cri dallegresse
 A Marengo Bonaparte est vainqueur
 Le canon gronde un autre chant commence
 Nous celebrons tant de faits eclatans
 Les rois jamais nenvahiront la France
 Dans un grenier quon est bien a vingt ans

 Quittons ce toit ou ma raison senivre
 Oh quils sont loin ces jours si regrettes
 Jechangerais ce quil me reste a vivre
 Contre un des mois quici Dieu ma comptes
 Pour rever gloire amour plaisir folie
 Pour depenser sa vie en peu dinstans
 Dun long espoir pour la voir embellie
 Dans un grenier quon est bien a vingt ans




THE GARRET


 With pensive eyes the little room I view
 Where in my youth I weathered it so long
 With a wild mistress a stanch friend or two
 And a light heart still breaking into song
 Making a mock of life and all its cares
 Rich in the glory of my rising sun
 Lightly I vaulted up four pair of stairs
 In the brave days when I was twentyone

 Yes tis a garretlet him knowt who will
 There was my bedfull hard it was and small
 My table thereand I decipher still
 Half a lame couplet charcoaled on the wall
 Ye joys that Time hath swept with him away
 Come to mine eyes ye dreams of love and fun
 For you I pawned my watch how many a day
 In the brave days when I was twentyone

 And see my little Jessy first of all
 She comes with pouting lips and sparkling eyes
 Behold how roguishly she pins her shawl
 Across the narrow casement curtainwise
 Now by the bed her petticoat glides down
 And when did woman look the worse in none
 I have heard since who paid for many a gown
 In the brave days when I was twentyone

 One jolly evening when my friends and I
 Made happy music with our songs and cheers
 A shout of triumph mounted up thus high
 And distant cannon opened on our ears
 We risewe join in the triumphant strain
 Napoleon conquersAusterlitz is won
 Tyrants shall never tread us down again
 In the brave days when I was twentyone

 Let us begonethe place is sad and strange
 How far far off these happy times appear
 All that I have to live Id gladly change
 For one such month as I have wasted here
 To draw long dreams of beauty love and power
 From founts of hope that never will outrun
 And drink all lifes quintessence in an hour
 Give me the days when I was twentyone

JOLLY JACK


 When fierce political debate
 Throughout the isle was storming
 And Rads attacked the throne and state
 And Tories the reforming
 To calm the furious rage of each
 And right the land demented
 Heaven sent us Jolly Jack to teach
 The way to be contented

 Jacks bed was straw twas warm and soft
 His chair a threelegged stool
 His broken jug was emptied oft
 Yet somehow always full
 His mistress portrait decked the wall
 His mirror had a crack
 Yet gay and glad though this was all
 His wealth lived Jolly Jack

 To give advice to avarice
 Teach pride its mean condition
 And preach good sense to dull pretence
 Was honest Jacks high mission
 Our simple statesman found his rule
 Of moral in the flagon
 And held his philosophic school
 Beneath the George and Dragon

 When village Solons cursed the Lords
 And called the malttax sinful
 Jack heeded not their angry words
 But smiled and drank his skinful
 And when men wasted health and life
 In search of rank and riches
 Jack marked aloof the paltry strife
 And wore his threadbare breeches

 I enter not the church he said
 But Ill not seek to rob it
 So worthy Jack Joe Miller read
 While others studied Cobbett
 His talk it was of feast and fun
 His guide the Almanack
 From youth to age thus gayly run
 The life of Jolly Jack

 And when Jack prayed as oft he would
 He humbly thanked his Maker
 I am said he O Father good
 Nor Catholic nor Quaker
 Give each his creed let each proclaim
 His catalogue of curses
 I trust in Thee and not in them
 In Thee and in Thy mercies

 Forgive me if midst all Thy works
 No hint I see of damning
 And think theres faith among the Turks
 And hope for een the Brahmin
 Harmless my mind is and my mirth
 And kindly is my laughter
 I cannot see the smiling earth
 And think theres hell hereafter

 Jack died he left no legacy
 Save that his story teaches
 Content to peevish poverty
 Humility to riches
 Ye scornful great ye envious small
 Come follow in his track
 We all were happier if we all
 Would copy JOLLY JACK





IMITATION OF HORACE


 TO HIS SERVING BOY


 Persicos odi
 Puer apparatus
 Displicent nexae
 Philyra coronae
 Mitte sectari
 Rosa qua locorum
 Sera moretur

 Simplici myrto
 Nihil allabores
 Sedulus curo
 Neque te ministrum
 Dedecet myrtus
 Neque me sub arcta
 Vite bibentem




AD MINISTRAM


 Dear LUCY you know what my wish is
 I hate all your Frenchified fuss
 Your silly entrees and made dishes
 Were never intended for us
 No footman in lace and in ruffles
 Need dangle behind my armchair
 And never mind seeking for truffles
 Although they be ever so rare

 But a plain leg of mutton my Lucy
 I prithee get ready at three
 Have it smoking and tender and juicy
 And what better meat can there be
 And when it has feasted the master
 Twill amply suffice for the maid
 Meanwhile I will smoke my canaster
 And tipple my ale in the shade





OLD FRIENDS WITH NEW FACES




THE KNIGHTLY GUERDON


 Untrue to my Ulric I never could be
 I vow by the saints and the blessed Marie
 Since the desolate hour when we stood by the shore
 And your dark galley waited to carry you oer
 My faith then I plighted my love I confessd
 As I gave you the BATTLEAXE marked with your crest

 When the bold barons met in my fathers old hall
 Was not Edith the flower of the banquet and ball
 In the festival hour on the lips of your bride
 Was there ever a smile save with THEE at my side
 Alone in my turret I loved to sit best
 To blazon your BANNER and broider your crest

 The knights were assembled the tourney was gay
 Sir Ulric rode first in the warriormelee
 In the dire battlehour when the tourney was done
 And you gave to another the wreath you had won
 Though I never reproached thee cold cold was my breast
 As I thought of that BATTLEAXE ah and that crest

 But away with remembrance no more will I pine
 That others usurped for a time what was mine
 Theres a FESTIVAL HOUR for my Ulric and me
 Once more as of old shall he bend at my knee
 Once more by the side of the knight I love best
 Shall I blazon his BANNER and broider his crest


  WAPPING OLD STAIRS

 Your Molly has never been false she declares
 Since the last time we parted at Wapping Old Stairs
 When I said that I would continue the same
 And I gave you the baccobox marked with my name
 When I passed a whole fortnight between decks with you
 Did I eer give a kiss Tom to one of your crew
 To be useful and kind to my Thomas I stayd
 For his trousers I washed and his grog too I made

 Though you promised last Sunday to walk in the Mall
 With Susan from Deptford and likewise with Sall
 In silence I stood your unkindness to hear
 And only upbraided my Tom with a tear
 Why should Sall or should Susan than me be more prized
 For the heart that is true Tom should neer be despised
 Then be constant and kind nor your Molly forsake
 Still your trousers Ill wash and your grog too Ill make




THE ALMACKS ADIEU


 Your Fanny was never falsehearted
 And this she protests and she vows
 From the triste moment when we parted
 On the staircase of Devonshire House
 I blushed when you asked me to marry
 I vowed I would never forget
 And at parting I gave my dear Harry
 A beautiful vinegarette

 We spent en province all December
 And I neer condescended to look
 At Sir Charles or the rich county member
 Or even at that darling old Duke
 You were busy with dogs and with horses
 Alone in my chamber I sat
 And made you the nicest of purses
 And the smartest black satin cravat

 At night with that vile Lady Frances
 Je faisois moi tapisserie
 You danced every one of the dances
 And never once thought of poor me
 Mon pauvre petit coeur what a shiver
 I felt as she danced the last set
 And you gave O mon Dieu to revive her
 My beautiful vinegarette

 Return love away with coquetting
 This flirting disgraces a man
 And ah all the while youre forgetting
 The heart of your poor little Fan
 Reviens break away from those Circes
 Reviens for a nice little chat
 And Ive made you the sweetest of purses
 And a lovely black satin cravat




WHEN THE GLOOM IS ON THE GLEN


 When the moonlights on the mountain
 And the gloom is on the glen
 At the cross beside the fountain
 There is one will meet thee then
 At the cross beside the fountain
 Yes the cross beside the fountain
 There is one will meet thee then

 I have braved since first we met love
 Many a danger in my course
 But I never can forget love
 That dear fountain that old cross
 Where her mantle shrouded oer her
 For the winds were chilly then
 First I met my Leonora
 When the gloom was on the glen

 Many a clime Ive ranged since then love
 Many a land Ive wandered oer
 But a valley like that glen love
 Half so dear I never sor
 Neer saw maiden fairer coyer
 Than wert thou my true love when
 In the gloaming first I saw yer
 In the gloaming of the glen




THE RED FLAG


 Where the quivering lightning flings
 His arrows from out the clouds
 And the howling tempest sings
 And whistles among the shrouds
 Tis pleasant tis pleasant to ride
 Along the foaming brine
 Wilt be the Rovers bride
 Wilt follow him lady mine
 Hurrah
 For the bonny bonny brine

 Amidst the storm and rack
 You shall see our galley pass
 As a serpent lithe and black
 Glides through the waving grass
 As the vulture swift and dark
 Down on the ringdove flies
 You shall see the Rovers bark
 Swoop down upon his prize
 Hurrah
 For the bonny bonny prize

 Over her sides we dash
 We gallop across her deck
 Ha theres a ghastly gash
 On the merchantcaptains neck
 Well shot well shot old Ned
 Well struck well struck black James
 Our arms are red and our foes are dead
 And we leave a ship in flames
 Hurrah
 For the bonny bonny flames




DEAR JACK


 Dear Jack this white mug that with Guinness I fill
 And drink to the health of sweet Nan of the Hill
 Was once Tommy Tosspots as jovial a sot
 As eer drew a spigot or draind a full pot
 In drinking all round twas his joy to surpass
 And with all merry tipplers he swiggd off his glass

 One morning in summer while seated so snug
 In the porch of his garden discussing his jug
 Stern Death on a sudden to Tom did appear
 And said Honest Thomas come take your last bier
 We kneaded his clay in the shape of this can
 From which let us drink to the health of my Nan




COMMANDERS OF THE FAITHFUL


 The Pope he is a happy man
 His Palace is the Vatican
 And there he sits and drains his can
 The Pope he is a happy man
 I often say when Im at home
 Id like to be the Pope of Rome

 And then theres Sultan Saladin
 That Turkish Soldan full of sin
 He has a hundred wives at least
 By which his pleasure is increased
 Ive often wished I hope no sin
 That I were Sultan Saladin

 But no the Pope no wife may choose
 And so I would not wear his shoes
 No wine may drink the proud Paynim
 And so Id rather not be him
 My wife my wine I love I hope
 And would be neither Turk nor Pope




WHEN MOONLIKE ORE THE HAZURE SEAS


 When moonlike ore the hazure seas
 In soft effulgence swells
 When silver jews and balmy breaze
 Bend down the Lilys bells
 When calm and deap the rosy sleep
 Has lapt your soal in dreems
 R Hangeline R lady mine
 Dost thou remember Jeames

 I mark thee in the Marble All
 Where Englands loveliest shine
 I say the fairest of them hall
 Is Lady Hangeline
 My soul in desolate eclipse
 With recollection teems
 And then I hask with weeping lips
 Dost thou remember Jeames

 Away I may not tell thee hall
 This soughring heart endures
 There is a lonely sperritcall
 That Sorrow never cures
 There is a little little Star
 That still above me beams
 It is the Star of Hopebut ar
 Dost thou remember Jeames




KING CANUTE


 KING CANUTE was weary hearted he had reigned for years a score
 Battling struggling pushing fighting killing much and robbing more
 And he thought upon his actions walking by the wild seashore

 Twixt the Chancellor and Bishop walked the King with steps sedate
 Chamberlains and grooms came after silversticks and goldsticks great
 Chaplains aidesdecamp and pagesall the officers of state

 Sliding after like his shadow pausing when he chose to pause
 If a frown his face contracted straight the courtiers dropped their
 jaws
 If to laugh the king was minded out they burst in loud heehaws

 But that day a something vexed him that was clear to old and young
 Thrice his Grace had yawned at table when his favorite gleemen sung
 Once the Queen would have consoled him but he bade her hold her tongue

 Something ails my gracious master cried the Keeper of the Seal
 Sure my lord it is the lampreys served to dinner or the veal
 Psha exclaimed the angry monarch Keeper tis not that I feel

 Tis the HEART and not the dinner fool that doth my rest impair
 Can a king be great as I am prithee and yet know no care
 Oh Im sick and tired and wearySome one cried The Kings arm
 chair

 Then towards the lackeys turning quick my Lord the Keeper nodded
 Straight the Kings great chair was brought him by two footmen able
 bodied
 Languidly he sank into it it was comfortably wadded

 Leading on my fierce companions cried he over storm and brine
 I have fought and I have conquered Where was glory like to mine
 Loudly all the courtiers echoed Where is glory like to thine

 What avail me all my kingdoms Weary am I now and old
 Those fair sons I have begotten long to see me dead and cold
 Would I were and quiet buried underneath the silent mould

 Oh remorse the writhing serpent at my bosom tears and bites
 Horrid horrid things I look on though I put out all the lights
 Ghosts of ghastly recollections troop about my bed at nights

 Cities burning convents blazing red with sacrilegious fires
 Mothers weeping virgins screaming vainly for their slaughtered
 sires
 Such a tender conscience cries the Bishop every one admires

 But for such unpleasant bygones cease my gracious lord to search
 Theyre forgotten and forgiven by our Holy Mother Church
 Never never does she leave her benefactors in the lurch

 Look the land is crowned with minsters which your Graces bounty
 raised
 Abbeys filled with holy men where you and Heaven are daily praised
 YOU my lord to think of dying on my conscience Im amazed

 Nay I feel replied King Canute that my end is drawing near
 Dont say so exclaimed the courtiers striving each to squeeze a
 tear
 Sure your Grace is strong and lusty and may live this fifty year

 Live these fifty years the Bishop roared with actions made to suit
 Are you mad my good Lord Keeper thus to speak of King Canute
 Men have lived a thousand years and sure his Majesty will dot

 Adam Enoch Lamech Cainan Mahaleel Methusela
 Lived nine hundred years apiece and maynt the King as well as they
 Fervently exclaimed the Keeper fervently I trust he may

 HE to die resumed the Bishop He a mortal like to US
 Death was not for him intended though communis omnibus
 Keeper you are irreligious for to talk and cavil thus

 With his wondrous skill in healing neer a doctor can compete
 Loathsome lepers if he touch them start up clean upon their feet
 Surely he could raise the dead up did his Highness think it meet

 Did not once the Jewish captain stay the sun upon the hill
 And the while he slew the foemen bid the silver moon stand still
 So no doubt could gracious Canute if it were his sacred will

 Might I stay the sun above us good sir Bishop Canute cried
 Could I bid the silver moon to pause upon her heavenly ride
 If the moon obeys my orders sure I can command the tide

 Will the advancing waves obey me Bishop if I make the sign
 Said the Bishop bowing lowly Land and sea my lord are thine
 Canute turned towards the oceanBack he said thou foaming brine

 From the sacred shore I stand on I command thee to retreat
 Venture not thou stormy rebel to approach thy masters seat
 Ocean be thou still I bid thee come not nearer to my feet

 But the sullen ocean answered with a louder deeper roar
 And the rapid waves drew nearer falling sounding on the shore
 Back the Keeper and the Bishop back the king and courtiers bore

 And he sternly bade them never more to kneel to human clay
 But alone to praise and worship That which earth and seas obey
 And his golden crown of empire never wore he from that day
 King Canute is dead and gone Parasites exist alway




FRIARS SONG


 Some love the matinchimes which tell
 The hour of prayer to sinner
 But better fars the midday bell
 Which speaks the hour of dinner
 For when I see a smoking fish
 Or capon drownd in gravy
 Or noble haunch on silver dish
 Full glad I sing my ave

 My pulpit is an alehouse bench
 Whereon I sit so jolly
 A smiling rosy country wench
 My saint and patron holy
 I kiss her cheek so red and sleek
 I press her ringlets wavy
 And in her willing ear I speak
 A most religious ave

 And if Im blind yet heaven is kind
 And holy saints forgiving
 For sure he leads a right good life
 Who thus admires good living
 Above they say our flesh is air
 Our blood celestial ichor
 Oh grant mid all the changes there
 They may not change our liquor




ATRA CURA


 Before I lost my five poor wits
 I mind me of a Romish clerk
 Who sang how Care the phantom dark
 Beside the belted horseman sits
 Methought I saw the grisly sprite
 Jump up but now behind my Knight

 And though he gallop as he may
 I mark that cursed monster black
 Still sits behind his honors back
 Tight squeezing of his heart alway
 Like two black Templars sit they there
 Beside one crupper Knight and Care

 No knight am I with pennoned spear
 To prance upon a bold destrere
 I will not have black Care prevail
 Upon my longeared chargers tail
 For lo I am a witless fool
 And laugh at Grief and ride a mule




REQUIESCAT


 Under the stone you behold
 Buried and coffined and cold
 Lieth Sir Wilfrid the Bold

 Always he marched in advance
 Warring in Flanders and France
 Doughty with sword and with lance

 Famous in Saracen fight
 Rode in his youth the good knight
 Scattering Paynims in flight

 Brian the Templar untrue
 Fairly in tourney he slew
 Saw Hierusalem too

 Now he is buried and gone
 Lying beneath the gray stone
 Where shall you find such a one

 Long time his widow deplored
 Weeping the fate of her lord
 Sadly cut off by the sword

 When she was eased of her pain
 Came the good Lord Athelstane
 When her ladyship married again




LINES UPON MY SISTERS PORTRAIT

 BY THE LORD SOUTHDOWN


 The castle towers of Bareacres are fair upon the lea
 Where the cliffs of bonny Diddlesex rise up from out the sea
 I stood upon the donjon keep and viewd the country oer
 I saw the lands of Bareacres for fifty miles or more
 I stood upon the donjon keepit is a sacred place
 Where floated for eight hundred years the banner of my race
 Argent a dexter sinople and gules an azure field
 There neer was nobler cognizance on knightly warriors shield

 The first time England saw the shield twas round a Norman neck
 On board a ship from Valery King William was on deck
 A Norman lance the colors wore in Hastings fatal fray
 St Willibald for Bareacres twas double gules that day
 O Heaven and sweet St Willibald in many a battle since
 A loyalhearted Bareacres has ridden by his Prince
 At Acre with Plantagenet with Edward at Poictiers
 The pennon of the Bareacres was foremost on the spears

 Twas pleasant in the battleshock to hear our warcry ringing
 Oh grant me sweet St Willibald to listen to such singing
 Three hundred steelclad gentlemen we drove the foe before us
 And thirty score of British bows kept twanging to the chorus
 O knights my noble ancestors and shall I never hear
 St Willibald for Bareacres through battle ringing clear
 Id cut me off this strong right hand a single hour to ride
 And strike a blow for Bareacres my fathers at your side

 Dash down dash down yon Mandolin beloved sister mine
 Those blushing lips may never sing the glories of our line
 Our ancient castles echo to the clumsy feet of churls
 The spinningjenny houses in the mansion of our Earls
 Sing not sing not my Angeline in days so base and vile
 Twere sinful to be happy twere sacrilege to smile
 Ill hie me to my lonely hall and by its cheerless hob
 Ill muse on other days and wishand wish I wereA SNOB




THE LEGEND OF ST SOPHIA OF KIOFF

 AN EPIC POEM IN TWENTY BOOKS


 I


 The Poet describes the city and spelling of Kiow Kioff or Kiova

 A thousand years ago or more
 A city filled with burghers stout
 And girt with ramparts round about
 Stood on the rocky Dnieper shore
 In armor bright by day and night
 The sentries they paced to and fro
 Well guarded and walled was this town and called
 By different names Id have you to know
 For if you looks in the gography books
 In those dictionaries the name it varies
 And they write it off Kieff or Kioff Kiova or Kiow


 II


 Its buildings public works and ordinances religious and civil

 Thus guarded without by wall and redoubt
 Kiova within was a place of renown
 With more advantages than in those dark ages
 Were commonly known to belong to a town
 There were places and squares and each year four fairs
 And regular aldermen and regular lordmayors
 And streets and alleys and a bishops palace
 And a church with clocks for the orthodox
 With clocks and with spires as religion desires
 And beadles to whip the bad little boys
 Over their poor little corduroys
 In servicetime when they DIDNT make a noise
 And a chapter and dean and a cathedralgreen
 With ancient trees underneath whose shades
 Wandered nice young nurserymaids

 The poet shows how a certain priest dwelt at Kioff a godly
 clergyman and one that preached rare good sermons

 Dingdong dingdong dingdingaringding
 The bells they made a merry merry ring
 From the tall tall steeple and all the people
 Except the Jews came and filled the pews
 Poles Russians and Germans
 To hear the sermons
 Which HYACINTH preached godly to those Germans and Poles
 For the safety of their souls


 III


 How this priest was short and fat of body

 A worthy priest he was and a stout
 Youve seldom looked on such a one
 For though he fasted thrice in a week
 Yet nevertheless his skin was sleek
 His waist it spanned two yards about
 And he weighed a score of stone


 IV


 And like unto the author of Plymleys Letters

 A worthy priest for fasting and prayer
 And mortification most deserving
 And as for preaching beyond compare
 Hed exert his powers for three or four hours
 With greater pith than Sydney Smith
 Or the Reverend Edward Irving


 V


 Of what convent he was prior and when the convent was built

 He was the prior of Saint Sophia
 A Cockney rhyme but no better I know
 Of St Sophia that Church in Kiow
 Built by missionaries I cant tell when
 Who by their discussions converted the Russians
 And made them Christian men


 VI


 Of Saint Sophia of Kioff and how her statue miraculously
 travelled thither

 Sainted Sophia so the legend vows
 With special favor did regard this house
 And to uphold her converts new devotion
 Her statue needing but her legs for HER ship
 Walks of itself across the German Ocean
 And of a sudden perches
 In this the best of churches
 Whither all Kiovites come and pay it grateful worship


 VII


 And how Kioff should have been a happy city but that

 Thus with her patronsaints and pious preachers
 Recorded here in catalogue precise
 A goodly city worthy magistrates
 You would have thought in all the Russian states
 The citizens the happiest of all creatures
 The town itself a perfect Paradise


 VIII


 Certain wicked Cossacks did besiege it

 No alas this wellbuilt city
 Was in a perpetual fidget
 For the Tartars without pity
 Did remorselessly besiege it

 Tartars fierce with sword and sabres
 Huns and Turks and such as these
 Envied much their peaceful neighbors
 By the blue Borysthenes

 Murdering the citizens

 Down they came these ruthless Russians
 From their steppes and woods and fens
 For to levy contributions
 On the peaceful citizens

 Winter Summer Spring and Autumn
 Down they came to peaceful Kioff
 Killed the burghers when they caught em
 If their lives they would not buy off

 Until they agreed to pay a tribute yearly

 Till the city quite confounded
 By the ravages they made
 Humbly with their chief compounded
 And a yearly tribute paid

 How they paid the tribute and suddenly refused it

 Which because their courage lax was
 They discharged while they were able
 Tolerated thus the tax was
 Till it grew intolerable

 To the wonder of the Cossack envoy

 And the Calmuc envoy sent
 As before to take their dues all
 Got to his astonishment
 A unanimous refusal

 Of a mighty gallant speech

 Men of Kioff thus courageous
 Did the stout lordmayor harangue them
 Wherefore pay these sneaking wages
 To the hectoring Russians hang them

 That the lordmayor made

 Hark I hear the awful cry of
 Our forefathers in their graves
 Fight ye citizens of Kioff
 Kioff was not made for slaves

 Exhorting the burghers to pay no longer

 All too long have ye betrayed her
 Rouse ye men and aldermen
 Send the insolent invader
 Send him starving back again


 IX


 Of their thanks and heroic resolves

 He spoke and he sat down the people of the town
 Who were fired with a brave emulation
 Now rose with one accord and voted thanks unto the lord
 Mayor for his oration

 They dismiss the envoy and set about drilling

 The envoy they dismissed never placing in his fist
 So much as a single shilling
 And all with courage fired as his lordship he desired
 At once set about their drilling

 Of the City guard viz Militia dragoons and bombardiers and
 their commanders

 Then every city ward established a guard
 Diurnal and nocturnal
 Militia volunteers light dragoons and bombardiers
 With an alderman for colonel

 Of the majors and captains

 There was muster and rollcalls and repairing city walls
 And filling up of fosses
 And the captains and the majors gallant and courageous
 Ariding about on their hosses

 The fortifications and artillery

 To be guarded at all hours they built themselves watchtowers
 With every tower a man on
 And surely and secure each from out his embrasure
 Looked down the iron cannon

 Of the conduct of the actors and the clergy

 A battlesong was writ for the theatre where it
 Was sung with vast energy
 And rapturous applause and besides the public cause
 Was supported by the clergy

 The pretty ladiesmaids were pinning of cockades
 And tying on of sashes
 And dropping gentle tears while their lovers blusterd fierce
 About gunshot and gashes

 Of the ladies

 The ladies took the hint and all day were scraping lint
 As became their softer genders
 And got bandages and beds for the limbs and for the heads
 Of the citys brave defenders

 And finally of the taylors

 The men both young and old felt resolute and bold
 And panted hot for glory
 Even the tailors gan to brag and embroidered on their flag
 AUT WINCERE AUT MORI


 X


 Of the Cossack chiefhis stratagem

 Seeing the citys resolute condition
 The Cossack chief too cunning to despise it
 Said to himself Not having ammunition
 Wherewith to batter the place in proper form
 Some of these nights Ill carry it by storm
 And sudden escalade it or surprise it

 And the burghers sillie victorie

 Lets see however if the cits stand firmish
 He rode up to the city gates for answers
 Out rushed an eager troop of the town elite
 And straightway did begin a gallant skirmish
 The Cossack hereupon did sound retreat
 Leaving the victory with the city lancers

 What prisoners they took

 They took two prisoners and as many horses
 And the whole town grew quickly so elate
 With this small victory of their virgin forces
 That they did deem their privates and commanders
 So many Caesars Pompeys Alexanders
 Napoleons or Fredericks the Great

 And how conceited they were

 And puffing with inordinate conceit
 They utterly despised these Cossack thieves
 And thought the ruffians easier to beat
 Than porters carpets think or ushers boys
 Meanwhile a sly spectator of their joys
 The Cossack captain giggled in his sleeves

 Of the Cossack chiefhis orders

 Wheneer you meet yon stupid city hogs
 He bade his troops precise this order keep
 Dont stand a momentrun away you dogs
 Twas done and when they met the town battalions
 The Cossacks as if frightened at their valiance
 Turned tail and bolted like so many sheep

 And how he feigned a retreat

 They fled obedient to their captains order
 And now this bloodless siege a month had lasted
 When viewing the country round the city warder
 Who like a faithful weathercock did perch
 Upon the steeple of St Sophys church
 Sudden his trumpet took and a mighty blast he blasted

 The warder proclayms the Cossacks retreat and the citie greatly
 rejoyces

 His voice it might be heard through all the streets
 He was a warder wondrous strong in lung
 Victory victory the foe retreats
 The foe retreats each cries to each he meets
 The foe retreats each in his turn repeats
 Gods how the guns did roar and how the joybells rung

 Arming in haste his gallant city lancers
 The mayor to learn if true the news might be
 A league or two out issued with his prancers
 The Cossacks something had given their courage a damper
 Hastened their flight and gan like mad to scamper
 Blessed be all the saints Kiova town was free


 XI


 Now puffed with pride the mayor grew vain
 Fought all his battles oer again
 And thrice he routed all his foes and thrice he slew the slain
 Tis true he might amuse himself thus
 And not be very murderous
 For as of those who to death were done
 The number was exactly NONE
 His lordship in his souls elation
 Did take a bloodless recreation

 The manner of the cities rejoycings

 Going home again he did ordain
 A very splendid cold collation
 For the magistrates and the corporation
 Likewise a grand illumination
 For the amusement of the nation
 That night the theatres were free
 The conduits they ran Malvolsie
 Each house that night did beam with light
 And sound with mirth and jollity

 And its impiety

 But shame O shame not a soul in the town
 Now the city was safe and the Cossacks flown
 Ever thought of the bountiful saint by whose care
 The town had been rid of these terrible Turks
 Said even a prayer to that patroness fair
 For these her wondrous works

 How the priest Hyacinth waited at church and nobody came
 thither

 Lord Hyacinth waited the meekest of priors
 He waited at church with the rest of his friars
 He went there at noon and he waited till ten
 Expecting in vain the lordmayor and his men
 He waited and waited from midday to dark
 But in vainyou might search through the whole of the church
 Not a layman alas to the citys disgrace
 From midday to dark showed his nose in the place
 The pewwoman organist beadle and clerk
 Kept away from their work and were dancing like mad
 Away in the streets with the other mad people
 Not thinking to pray but to guzzle and tipple
 Wherever the drink might be had


 XII


 How he went forth to bid them to prayer

 Amidst this din and revelry throughout the city roaring
 The silver moon rose silently and high in heaven soaring
 Prior Hyacinth was fervently upon his knees adoring
 Towards my precious patroness this conduct sure unfair is
 I cannot think I must confess what keeps the dignitaries
 And our good mayor away unless some business them contraries
 He puts his long white mantle on and forth the prior sallies
 His pious thoughts were bent upon good deeds and not on malice
 Heavens how the banquet lights they shone about the mayors palace

 How the grooms and lackeys jeered him

 About the hall the scullions ran with meats both and fresh and
 potted
 The pages came with cup and can all for the guests allotted
 Ah how they jeered that good fat man as up the stairs he trotted

 He entered in the anterooms where sat the mayors court in
 He found a pack of drunken grooms adicing and asporting
 The horrid wine and bacco fumes they set the prior asnorting
 The prior thought hed speak about their sins before he went hence
 And lustily began to shout of sin and of repentance
 The rogues they kicked the prior out before hed done a sentence

 And having got no portion small of buffeting and tussling
 At last he reached the banquethall where sat the mayor
 aguzzling
 And by his side his lady tall dressed out in white sprig muslin

 And the mayor mayoress and aldermen being tipsie refused to go
 church

 Around the table in a ring the guests were drinking heavy
 Theyd drunk the church and drunk the king and the army and the
 navy
 In fact theyd toasted everything The prior said God save ye

 The mayor cried Bring a silver cuptheres one upon the beaufet
 And Prior have the venison upits capital rechauffe
 And so Sir Priest youve come to sup And pray you hows Saint
 Sophy
 The priors face quite red was grown with horror and with anger
 He flung the proffered goblet downit made a hideous clangor
 And gan apreaching with a frownhe was a fierce haranguer

 He tried the mayor and aldermenthey all set up ajeering
 He tried the commoncouncilmenthey too began asneering
 He turned towards the mayress then and hoped to get a hearing
 He knelt and seized her dinnerdress made of the muslin snowy
 To church to church my sweet mistress he cried the way Ill
 show ye
 Alas the ladymayoress fell back as drunk as Chloe


 XIII


 How the prior went back alone

 Out from this dissolute and drunken court
 Went the good prior his eyes with weeping dim
 He tried the people of a meaner sort
 They too alas were bent upon their sport
 And not a single soul would follow him
 But all were swigging schnaps and guzzling beer

 He found the cits their daughters sons and spouses
 Spending the livelong night in fierce carouses
 Alas unthinking of the danger near
 One or two sentinels the ramparts guarded
 The rest were sharing in the general feast
 God wot our tipsy town is poorly warded
 Sweet Saint Sophia help us cried the priest

 Alone he entered the cathedral gate
 Careful he locked the mighty oaken door
 Within his company of monks did wait
 A dozen poor old pious menno more
 Oh but it grieved the gentle prior sore
 To think of those lost souls given up to drink and fate

 And shut himself into Saint Sophias chapel with his brethren

 The mighty outer gate well barred and fast
 The poor old friars stirred their poor old bones
 And pattering swiftly on the damp cold stones
 They through the solitary chancel passed
 The chancel walls looked black and dim and vast
 And rendered ghostlike melancholy tones

 Onward the fathers sped till coming nigh a
 Small iron gate the which they entered quick at
 They locked and doublelocked the inner wicket
 And stood within the chapel of Sophia
 Vain were it to describe this sainted place
 Vain to describe that celebrated trophy
 The venerable statue of Saint Sophy
 Which formed its chiefest ornament and grace

 Here the good prior his personal griefs and sorrows
 In his extreme devotion quickly merging
 At once began to pray with voice sonorous
 The other friars joined in pious chorus
 And passed the night in singing praying scourging
 In honor of Sophia that sweet virgin


 XIV


 The episode of Sneezoff and Katinka

 Leaving thus the pious priest in
 Humble penitence and prayer
 And the greedy cits afeasting
 Let us to the walls repair

 Walking by the sentryboxes
 Underneath the silver moon
 Lo the sentry boldly cocks his
 Boldly cocks his musketoon

 Sneezoff was his designation
 Fairhaired boy for ever pitied
 For to take his cruel station
 He but now Katinka quitted

 Poor in purse were both but rich in
 Tender loves delicious plenties
 She a damsel of the kitchen
 He a haberdashers prentice

 Tinka maiden tenderhearted
 Was dissolved in tearful fits
 On that fatal night she parted
 From her darling fairhaired Fritz

 Warm her soldier lad she wrapt in
 Comforter and muffettee
 Called him general and captain
 Though a simple private he

 On your bosom wear this plaster
 Twill defend you from the cold
 In your pipe smoke this canaster
 Smuggled tis my love and old

 All the night my love Ill miss you
 Thus she spoke and from the door
 Fairhaired Sneezoff made his issue
 To return alas no more

 He it is who calmly walks his
 Walk beneath the silver moon
 He it is who boldly cocks his
 Detonating musketoon

 He the bland canaster puffing
 As upon his round he paces
 Sudden sees a ragamuffin
 Clambering swiftly up the glacis

 Who goes there exclaims the sentry
 When the sun has once gone down
 No one ever makes an entry
 Into this here fortified town

 How the sentrie Sneezoff was surprised and slayn

 Shouted thus the watchful Sneezoff
 But ere any one replied
 Wretched youth he fired his piece off
 Started staggered groaned and died


 XV


 How the Cossacks rushed in suddenly and took the citie

 Ah full well might the sentinel cry Who goes there
 But echo was frightened too much to declare
 Who goes there who goes there Can any one swear
 To the number of sands sur les bords de la mer
 Or the whiskers of DOrsay Count down to a hair
 As well might you tell of the sands the amount
 Or number each hair in each curl of the Count
 As ever proclaim the number and name
 Of the hundreds and thousands that up the wall came

 Of the Cossack troops

 Down down the knaves poured with fire and with sword
 There were thieves from the Danube and rogues from the Don
 There were Turks and Wallacks and shouting Cossacks
 Of all nations and regions and tongues and religions
 Jew Christian Idolater Frank Mussulman
 Ah horrible sight was Kioff that night

 And of their manner of burning murdering and ravishing

 The gates were all takenno chance een of flight
 And with torch and with axe the bloody Cossacks
 Went hither and thither ahunting in packs
 They slashed and they slew both Christian and Jew
 Women and children they slaughtered them too
 Some saving their throats plunged into the moats
 Or the riverbut oh they had burned all the boats

     

 How they burned the whole citie down save the church

 But here let us pausefor I cant pursue further
 This scene of rack ravishment ruin and murther
 Too well did the cunning old Cossack succeed
 His plan of attack was successful indeed
 The night was his ownthe town it was gone
 Twas a heap still aburning of timber and stone

 Whereof the bells began to ring

 One building alone had escaped from the fires
 Saint Sophys fair church with its steeples and spires
 Calm stately and white
 It stood in the light
 And as if twould defy all the conquerors power
 As if nought had occurred
 Might clearly be heard
 The chimes ringing soberly every halfhour


 XVI


 The city was defunctsilence succeeded
 Unto its last fierce agonizing yell
 And then it was the conqueror first heeded
 The sound of these calm bells

 How the Cossack chief bade them burn the church too

 Furious towards his aidesdecamp he turns
 And speaking as if Byrons works he knew
 Villains he fiercely cries the city burns
 Why not the temple too
 Burn me yon church and murder all within

 How they stormed it and of Hyacinth his anger thereat

 The Cossacks thundered at the outer door
 And Father Hyacinth who heard the din
 And thought himself and brethren in distress
 Deserted by their lady patroness
 Did to her statue turn and thus his woes outpour


 XVII


 His prayer to the Saint Sophia

 And is it thus O falsest of the saints
 Thou hearest our complaints
 Tell me did ever my attachment falter
 To serve thy altar
 Was not thy name ere ever I did sleep
 The last upon my lip
 Was not thy name the very first that broke
 From me when I awoke
 Have I not tried with fasting flogging penance
 And mortified countenance
 For to find favor Sophy in thy sight
 And lo this night
 Forgetful of my prayers and thine own promise
 Thou turnest from us
 Lettest the heathen enter in our city
 And without pity
 Murder out burghers seize upon their spouses
 Burn down their houses
 Is such a breach of faith to be endured
 See what a lurid
 Light from the insolent invaders torches
 Shines on your porches
 Een now with thundering batteringram and hammer
 And hideous clamor
 With axemen swordsmen pikemen billmen bowmen
 The conquering foemen
 O Sophy beat your gate about your ears
 Alas and heres
 A humble company of pious men
 Like muttons in a pen
 Whose souls shall quickly from their bodies be thrusted
 Because in you they trusted
 Do you not know the Calmuc chiefs desires
 KILL ALL THE FRIARS
 And you of all the saints most false and fickle
 Leave us in this abominable pickle

 The statue suddenlie speaks

 RASH HYACINTHUS
 Here to the astonishment of all her backers
 Saint Sophy opening wide her wooden jaws
 Like to a pair of German walnutcrackers
 Began I did not think you had been thus
 O monk of little faith Is it because
 A rascal scum of filthy Cossack heathen
 Besiege our town that you distrust in ME then
 Thinkst thou that I who in a former day
 Did walk across the Sea of Marmora
 Not mentioning for shortness other seas
 That I who skimmed the broad Borysthenes
 Without so much as wetting of my toes
 Am frightened at a set of men like THOSE
 I have a mind to leave you to your fate
 Such cowardice as this my scorn inspires

 But is interrupted by the breaking in of the Cossacks

 Saint Sophy was here
 Cut short in her words
 For at this very moment in tumbled the gate
 And with a wild cheer
 And a clashing of swords
 Swift through the church porches
 With a waving of torches
 And a shriek and a yell
 Like the devils of hell
 With pike and with axe
 In rushed the Cossacks
 In rushed the Cossacks crying
 MURDER THE FRIARS

 Of Hyacinth his outrageous address

 Ah what a thrill felt Hyacinth
 When he heard that villanous shout Calmuc
 Now thought he my trial beginneth
 Saints O give me courage and pluck
 Courage boys tis useless to funk
 Thus unto the friars he began
 Never let it be said that a monk
 Is not likewise a gentleman
 Though the patron saint of the church
 Spite of all that weve done and weve prayd
 Leaves us wickedly here in the lurch
 Hang it gentlemen whos afraid

 And preparation for dying

 As thus the gallant Hyacinthus spoke
 He with an air as easy and as free as
 If the quickcoming murder were a joke
 Folded his robes around his sides and took
 Place under sainted Sophys legs of oak
 Like Caesar at the statue of Pompeius
 The monks no leisure had about to look
 Each being absorbed in his particular case
 Else had they seen with what celestial race
 A wooden smile stole oer the saints mahogany face

 Saint Sophia her speech

 Well done well done Hyacinthus my son
 Thus spoke the sainted statue
 Though you doubted me in the hour of need
 And spoke of me very rude indeed
 You deserve good luck for showing such pluck
 And I wont be angry at you

 She gets on the priors shoulder straddleback

 The monks bystanding one and all
 Of this wondrous scene beholders
 To this kind promise listened content
 And couldnt contain their astonishment
 When Saint Sophia moved and went
 Down from her wooden pedestal
 And twisted her legs sure as eggs is eggs
 Round Hyacinthuss shoulders

 And bids him run

 Ho forwards cried Sophy theres no time for waiting
 The Cossacks are breaking the very last gate in
 See the glare of their torches shines red through the grating
 Weve still the back door and two minutes or more
 Now boys now or never we must make for the river
 For we only are safe on the opposite shore
 Run swiftly today lads if ever you ran
 Put out your best leg Hyacinthus my man
 And Ill lay five to two that you carry us through
 Only scamper as fast as you can


 XVIII


 He runneth

 Away went the priest through the little back door
 And light on his shoulders the image he bore
 The honest old priest was not punished the least
 Though the image was eight feet and he measured four
 Away went the prior and the monks at his tail
 Went snorting and puffing and panting full sail
 And just as the last at the back door had passed
 In furious hunt behold at the front
 The Tartars so fierce with their terrible cheers
 With axes and halberts and muskets and spears
 With torches aflaming the chapel now came in
 They tore up the massbook they stamped on the psalter
 They pulled the gold crucifix down from the altar
 The vestments they burned with their blasphemous fires
 And many cried Curse on them where are the friars
 When loaded with plunder yet seeking for more
 One chanced to fling open the little back door
 Spied out the friars white robes and long shadows
 In the moon scampering over the meadows
 And stopped the Cossacks in the midst of their arsons
 By crying out lustily THERE GO THE PARSONS

 And the Tartars after him

 With a whoop and a yell and a scream and a shout
 At once the whole murderous body turned out
 And swift as the hawk pounces down on the pigeon
 Pursued the poor shortwinded men of religion

 How the friars sweated

 When the sound of that cheering came to the monks hearing
 O heaven how the poor fellows panted and blew
 At fighting not cunning unaccustomed to running
 When the Tartars came up what the deuce should they do
 Theyll make us all martyrs those bloodthirsty Tartars
 Quoth fat Father Peter to fat Father Hugh
 The shouts they came clearer the foe they drew nearer
 Oh how the bolts whistled and how the lights shone
 I cannot get further this running is murther
 Come carry me some one cried big Father John
 And even the statue grew frightened Od rat you
 It cried Mr Prior I wish youd get on
 On tugged the good friar but nigher and nigher
 Appeared the fierce Russians with sword and with fire
 On tugged the good prior at Saint Sophys desire
 A scramble through bramble through mud and through mire
 The swift arrows whizziness causing a dizziness
 Nigh done his business fit to expire

 And the pursuers fixed arrows into their tayles

 Father Hyacinth tugged and the monks they tugged after
 The foemen pursued with a horrible laughter
 And hurld their long spears round the poor brethrens ears
 So true that next day in the coats of each priest
 Though never a wound was given there were found
 A dozen arrows at least

 How at the last gasp

 Now the chase seemed at its worst
 Prior and monks were fit to burst
 Scarce you knew the which was first
 Or pursuers or pursued
 When the statue by heavens grace
 Suddenly did change the face
 Of this interesting race
 As a saint sure only could

 For as the jockey who at Epsom rides
 When that his steed is spent and punished sore
 Diggeth his heels into the coursers sides
 And thereby makes him run one or two furlongs more
 Even thus betwixt the eighth rib and the ninth
 The saint rebuked the prior that weary creeper
 Fresh strength into his limbs her kicks imparted
 One bound he made as gay as when he started

 The friars won and jumped into Borysthenes fluvius

 Yes with his brethren clinging at his cloak
 The statue on his shouldersfit to choke
 One most tremendous bound made Hyacinth
 And soused friars statue and all slapdash into the Dnieper


 XIX


 And how the Russians saw

 And when the Russians in a fiery rank
 Panting and fierce drew up along the shore
 For here the vain pursuing they forbore
 Nor cared they to surpass the rivers bank
 Then looking from the rocks and rushes dank
 A sight they witnessed never seen before
 And which with its accompaniments glorious
 Is writ i the golden book or liber aureus

 The statue get off Hyacinth his back and sit down with the friars
 on Hyacinth his cloak

 Plump in the Dnieper flounced the friar and friends
 They dangling round his neck he fit to choke
 When suddenly his most miraculous cloak
 Over the billowy waves itself extends
 Down from his shoulders quietly descends
 The venerable Sophys statue of oak
 Which sitting down upon the cloak so ample
 Bids all the brethren follow its example

 How in this manner of boat they sayled away

 Each at her bidding sat and sat at ease
 The statue gan a gracious conversation
 And waving to the foe a salutation
 Saild with her wondering happy proteges
 Gayly adown the wide Borysthenes
 Until they came unto some friendly nation
 And when the heathen had at length grown shy of
 Their conquest she one day came back again to Kioff

TITMARSHS CARMEN LILLIENSE


 LILLE Sept 2 1843

 My heart is weary my peace is gone
 How shall I eer my woes reveal
 I have no money I lie in pawn
 A stranger in the town of Lille


 I


 With twenty pounds but three weeks since
 From Paris forth did Titmarsh wheel
 I thought myself as rich a prince
 As beggar poor Im now at Lille

 Confiding in my ample means
 In troth I was a happy chiel
 I passed the gates of Valenciennes
 I never thought to come by Lille

 I never thought my twenty pounds
 Some rascal knave would dare to steal
 I gayly passed the Belgic bounds
 At Quievrain twenty miles from Lille

 To Antwerp town I hastend post
 And as I took my evening meal
 I felt my pouchmy purse was lost
 O Heaven Why came I not by Lille

 I straightway called for ink and pen
 To grandmamma I made appeal
 Meanwhile a loan of guineas ten
 I borrowed from a friend so leal

 I got the cash from grandmamma
 Her gentle heart my woes could feel
 But where I went and what I saw
 What matters Here I am at Lille

 My heart is weary my peace is gone
 How shall I eer my woes reveal
 I have no cash I lie in pawn
 A stranger in the town of Lille


 II


 To stealing I can never come
 To pawn my watch Im too genteel
 Besides I left my watch at home
 How could I pawn it then at Lille

 La note at times the guests will say
 I turn as white as cold boild veal
 I turn and look another way
 I dare not ask the bill at Lille

 I dare not to the landlord say
 Good sir I cannot pay your bill
 He thinks I am a Lord Anglais
 And is quite proud I stay at Lille

 He thinks I am a Lord Anglais
 Like Rothschild or Sir Robert Peel
 And so he serves me every day
 The best of meat and drink in Lille

 Yet when he looks me in the face
 I blush as red as cochineal
 And think did he but know my case
 How changed hed be my host of Lille

 My heart is weary my peace is gone
 How shall I eer my woes reveal
 I have no money I lie in pawn
 A stranger in the town of Lille


 III


 The sun bursts out in furious blaze
 I perspirate from head to heel
 Id like to hire a onehorse chaise
 How can I without cash at Lille

 I pass in sunshine burning hot
 By cafes where in beer they deal
 I think how pleasant were a pot
 A frothing pot of beer of Lille

 What is yon house with walls so thick
 All girt around with guard and grille
 O gracious gods it makes me sick
 It is the PRISONHOUSE of Lille

 O cursed prison strong and barred
 It does my very blood congeal
 I tremble as I pass the guard
 And quit that ugly part of Lille

 The churchdoor beggar whines and prays
 I turn away at his appeal
 Ah churchdoor beggar go thy ways
 Youre not the poorest man in Lille

 My heart is weary my peace is gone
 How shall I eer any woes reveal
 I have no money I lie in pawn
 A stranger in the town of Lille


 IV


 Say shall I to you Flemish church
 And at a Popish altar kneel
 Oh do not leave me in the lurch
 Ill cry ye patronsaints of Lille

 Ye virgins dressed in satin hoops
 Ye martyrs slain for mortal weal
 Look kindly down before you stoops
 The miserablest man in Lille

 And lo as I beheld with awe
 A pictured saint I swear tis real
 It smiled and turned to grandmamma
 It did and I had hope in Lille

 Twas five oclock and I could eat
 Although I could not pay my meal
 I hasten back into the street
 Where lies my inn the best Lille

 What see I on my table stand
 A letter with a wellknown seal
 Tis grandmammas I know her hand
 To Mr M A Titmarsh Lille

 I feel a choking in my throat
 I pant and stagger faint and reel
 It isit isa tenpound note
 And Im no more in pawn at Lille


 He goes off by the diligence that evening and is restored to the
 bosom of his happy family




THE WILLOWTREE


 Know ye the willowtree
 Whose gray leaves quiver
 Whispering gloomily
 To yon pale river
 Lady at eventide
 Wander not near it
 They say its branches hide
 A sad lost spirit

 Once to the willowtree
 A maid came fearful
 Pale seemed her cheek to be
 Her blue eye tearful
 Soon as she saw the tree
 Her step moved fleeter
 No one was thereah me
 No one to meet her

 Quick beat her heart to hear
 The far bells chime
 Toll from the chapeltower
 The trysting time
 But the red sun went down
 In golden flame
 And though she looked round
 Yet no one came

 Presently came the night
 Sadly to greet her
 Moon in her silver light
 Stars in their glitter
 Then sank the moon away
 Under the billow
 Still wept the maid alone
 There by the willow

 Through the long darkness
 By the stream rolling
 Hour after hour went on
 Tolling and tolling
 Long was the darkness
 Lonely and stilly
 Shrill came the nightwind
 Piercing and chilly

 Shrill blew the morning breeze
 Biting and cold
 Bleak peers the gray dawn
 Over the wold
 Bleak over moor and stream
 Looks the grey dawn
 Gray with dishevelled hair
 Still stands the willow there
 THE MAID IS GONE

 Domine Domine
 Sing we a litany
 Sing for poor maidenhearts broken and weary
 Domine Domine
 Sing we a litany
 Wail we and weep we a wild Miserere




THE WILLOWTREE

 ANOTHER VERSION


 I

 Long by the willowtrees
 Vainly they sought her
 Wild rang the mothers screams
 Oer the gray water
 Where is my lovely one
 Where is my daughter

 II

 Rouse thee sir constable
 Rouse thee and look
 Fisherman bring your net
 Boatman your hook
 Beat in the lilybeds
 Dive in the brook

 III

 Vainly the constable
 Shouted and called her
 Vainly the fisherman
 Beat the green alder
 Vainly he flung the net
 Never it hauled her

 IV

 Mother beside the fire
 Sat her nightcap in
 Father in easy chair
 Gloomily napping
 When at the windowsill
 Came a light tapping

 V

 And a pale countenance
 Looked through the casement
 Loud beat the mothers heart
 Sick with amazement
 And at the vision which
 Came to surprise her
 Shrieked in an agony
 Lor its Elizar

 VI

 Yes twas Elizabeth
 Yes twas their girl
 Pale was her cheek and her
 Hair out of curl
 Mother the loving one
 Blushing exclaimed
 Let not your innocent
 Lizzy be blamed

 VII

 Yesterday going to aunt
 Joness to tea
 Mother dear mother I
 FORGOT THE DOORKEY
 And as the night was cold
 And the way steep
 Mrs Jones kept me to
 Breakfast and sleep

 VIII

 Whether her Pa and Ma
 Fully believed her
 That we shall never know
 Stern they received her
 And for the work of that
 Cruel though short night
 Sent her to bed without
 Tea for a fortnight

 IX

 MORAL

 Hey diddle diddlety
 Cat and the Fiddlety
 Maidens of England take caution by she
 Let love and suicide
 Never tempt you aside
 And always remember to take the doorkey





LYRA HIBERNICA

 THE POEMS OF THE MOLONY OF KILBALLYMOLONY




THE PIMLICO PAVILION


 Ye pathrons of janius Minerva and Vanius
 Who sit on Parnassus that mountain of snow
 Descind from your station and make observation
 Of the Princes pavilion in sweet Pimlico

 This garden by jakurs is forty poor acres
 The garner he tould me and sure ought to know
 And yet greatly bigger in size and in figure
 Than the Phanix itself seems the Park Pimlico

 O tis there that the spoort is when the Queen and the Court is
 Walking magnanimous all of a row
 Forgetful what state is among the pataties
 And the pineapple gardens of sweet Pimlico

 There in blossoms odorous the birds sing a chorus
 Of God save the Queen as they hop to and fro
 And you sit on the binches and hark to the finches
 Singing melodious in sweet Pimlico

 There shuiting their phanthasies they pluck polyanthuses
 That round in the gardens resplindently grow
 Wid roses and jessimins and other sweet specimins
 Would charm bould Linnayus in sweet Pimlico

 You see when you inther and stand in the cinther
 Where the roses and necturns and collyflowers blow
 A hill so tremindous it tops the topwindows
 Of the elegant houses of famed Pimlico

 And when youve ascinded that precipice splindid
 You see on its summit a wondtherful show
 A lovely Swish building all painting and gilding
 The famous Pavilion of sweet Pimlico

 Prince Albert of Flandthers that Prince of Commandthers
 On whom my best blessings hereby I bestow
 With goold and vermilion has decked that Pavilion
 Where the Queen may take tay in her sweet Pimlico

 Theres lines from John Milton the chamber all gilt on
 And pictures beneath them thats shaped like a bow
 I was greatly astounded to think that that Roundhead
 Should find an admission to famed Pimlico

 O lovelys each fresco and most picturesque O
 And while round the chamber astonished I go
 I think Dan Maclises it baits all the pieces
 Surrounding the cottage of famed Pimlico

 Eastlake has the chimney a good one to limn he
 And a vargin he paints with a sarpent below
 While bulls pigs and panthers and other enchanthers
 Are painted by Landseer in sweet Pimlico

 And nature smiles opposite Stanfield he copies it
 Oer Claude or Poussang sure tis he that may crow
 But Sir Rosss best faiture is small miniature
 He shouldnt paint frescoes in famed Pimlico

 Theres Leslie and Uwins has rather small doings
 Theres Dyce as brave masther as England can show
 And the flowers and the sthrawherries sure he no dauber is
 That painted the panels of famed Pimlico

 In the pictures from Walther Scott never a fault theres got
 Sure the marbles as natural as thrue Scaglio
 And the Chamber Pompayen is sweet to take tay in
 And ait buttherd muffins in sweet Pimlico

 Theres landscapes by Gruner both solar and lunar
 Them two little Doyles too deserve a bravo
 Wid de piece by young Townsend for janins abounds int
 And thats why hes shuited to paint Pimlico

 That picture of Severns is worthy of revernce
 But some I wont mintion is rather so so
 For sweet philosophy or crumpets and coffee
 O wheres a Pavilion like sweet Pimlico

 O to praise this Pavilion would puzzle Quintilian
 Daymosthenes Brougham or young Cicero
 So heavenly Goddess dye pardon my modesty
 And silence my lyre about sweet Pimlico

 So let us raise

 And Alberts proud condition

 As he surveys

MOLONYS LAMENT


 O TIM did you hear of thim Saxons
 And read what the peepers report
 Theyre goan to recal the Liftinant
 And shut up the Castle and Coort

 Our desolate counthry of Oireland
 Theyre bint the blagyards to desthroy
 And now having murdthered our counthry
 Theyre goin to kill the Viceroy Dear boy
 Twas he was our proide and our joy

 And will we no longer behould him
 Surrounding his carriage in throngs
 As he weaves his cockedhat from the windies
 And smiles to his bould aiddecongs
 I liked for to see the young haroes
 All shoining with sthripes and with stars
 A horsing about in the Phaynix
 And winking the girls in the cyars
 Like Mars
 A smokin their poipes and cigyars

 Dear Mitchell exoiled to Bermudies
 Your beautiful oilids youll ope
 And therell be an abondance of croyin
 From OBrine at the Keep of Good Hope
 When they read of this news in the peepers
 Acrass the Atlantical wave
 That the last of the Oirish Liftinints
 Of the oisland of Seents has tuck lave God save
 The Queenshe should betther behave

 And whats to become of poor Dame Sthreet
 And wholl ait the puffs and the tarts
 Whin the Coort of imparial splindor
 From Doblins sad city departs
 And wholl have the fiddlers and pipers
 When the deuce of a Coort there remains
 And wherell be the bucks and the ladies
 To hire the Coortshuits and the thrains
 In sthrains
 Its thus that ould Erin complains

 Theres Counsellor Flanagans leedy
 Twas she in the Coort didnt fail
 And she wanted a plinty of popplin
 For her dthress and her flounce and her tail

 Eight shillings a yard tabinet
 But now that the Coort is concluded
 The divvle a yard will she get I bet
 Bedad that she wears the old set

 Theres Surgeon OToole and Miss Leary
 Theyd daylings at Madam ORiggs
 Each year at the dthrawingroom sayson
 They mounted the neatest of wigs
 When Spring with its buds and its dasies
 Comes out in her beauty and bloom
 Thim tull never think of new jasies
 Becase there is no dthrawingroom
 For whom
 Theyd choose the expense to ashume

 Theres Alderman Toad and his lady
 Twas they gave the Clart and the Poort
 And the poineapples turbots and lobsters
 To feast the Lord Liftinints Coort
 But now that the qualitys goin

 And the butcher may shut up his shop

 Yes the grooms and the ushers are goin
 And his Lordship the dear honest man
 And the Duchess his eemiable leedy
 And Corry the bould Connellan
 And little Lord Hyde and the childthren
 And the Chewter and Governess tu
 And the servants are packing their boxes
 Oh murther but what shall I due
 Without you

THE BATTLE OF LIMERICK


 Ye Genii of the nation
 Who look with veneration
 And Irelands desolation onsaysingly deplore
 Ye sons of General Jackson
 Who thrample on the Saxon
 Attend to the thransaction upon Shannon shore

 When William Duke of Schumbug
 A tyrant and a humbug
 With cannon and with thunder on our city bore
 Our fortitude and valiance
 Insthructed his battalions
 To respict the galliant Irish upon Shannon shore

 Since that capitulation
 No city in this nation
 So grand a reputation could boast before
 As Limerick prodigious
 That stands with quays and bridges
 And the ships up to the windies of the Shannon shore

 A chief of ancient line
 Tis William Smith OBrine
 Reprisints this darling Limerick this ten years or more
 O the Saxons cant endure
 To see him on the flure
 And thrimble at the Cicero from Shannon shore

 This valliant son of Mars
 Had been to visit Pars
 That land of Revolution that grows the tricolor
 And to welcome his returrn
 From pilgrimages furren
 We invited him to tay on the Shannon shore

 Then we summoned to our board
 Young Meagher of the sword
 Tis he will sheathe that battleaxe in Saxon gore
 And Mitchil of Belfast
 We bade to our repast
 To dthrink a dish of coffee on the Shannon shore

 Convaniently to hould
 These patriots so bould
 We tuck the opportunity of Tim Doolans store
 And with ornamints and banners
 As becomes gintale good manners
 We made the loveliest tayroom upon Shannon shore

 Twould binifit your sowls
 To see the butthered rowls
 The sugartongs and sangwidges and craim galyore
 And the muffins and the crumpets
 And the band of hearts and thrumpets
 To celebrate the sworry upon Shannon shore

 Sure the Imperor of Bohay
 Would be proud to dthrink the tay
 That Misthress Biddy Rooney for OBrine did pour
 And since the days of Strongbow
 There never was such Congo
 Mitchil dthrank six quarts of itby Shannon shore

 But Clarndon and Corry
 Connellan beheld this sworry
 With rage and imulation in their black hearts core
 And they hired a gang of ruffins
 To interrupt the muffins
 And the fragrance of the Congo on the Shannon shore

 When full of tay and cake
 OBrine began to spake
 But juice a one could hear him for a sudden roar
 Of a ragamuffin rout
 Began to yell and shout
 And frighten the propriety of Shannon shore

 As Smith OBrine harangued
 They batthered and they banged
 Tim Doolans doors and windies down they tore
 They smashed the lovely windies
 Hung with muslin from the Indies
 Purshuing of their shindies upon Shannon shore

 With throwing of brickbats
 Drowned puppies and dead rats
 These ruffin democrats themselves did lower
 Tin kettles rotten eggs
 Cabbagestalks and wooden legs
 They flung among the patriots of Shannon shore

 O the girls began to scrame
 And upset the milk and crame
 And the honorable gintlemin they cursed and swore
 And Mitchil of Belfast
 Twas he that looked aghast
 When they roasted him in effigy by Shannon shore

 O the lovely tay was spilt
 On that day of Irelands guilt
 Says Jack Mitchil I am kilt Boys wheres the back door
 Tis a national disgrace
 Let me go and veil me face
 And he boulted with quick pace from the Shannon shore

 Cut down the bloody horde
 Says Meagher of the sword
 This conduct would disgrace any blackamore
 But the best use Tommy made
 Of his famous battle blade
 Was to cut his own stick from the Shannon shore

 Immortal Smith OBrine
 Was raging like a line
 Twould have done your sowl good to have heard him roar
 In his glory he arose
 And he rushed upon his foes
 But they hit him on the nose by the Shannon shore

 Then the Futt and the Dthragoons
 In squadthrons and platoons
 With their music playing chunes down upon us bore
 And they bate the rattatoo
 But the Peelers came in view
 And ended the shaloo on the Shannon shore




LARRY OTOOLE


 Youve all heard of Larry OToole
 Of the beautiful town of Drumgoole
 He had but one eye
 To ogle ye by
 Oh murther but that was a jewl
 A fool
 He made of de girls dis OToole

 Twas he was the boy didnt fail
 That tuck down pataties and mail
 He never would shrink
 From any sthrong dthrink
 Was it whisky or Drogheda ale
 Im bail
 This Larry would swallow a pail

 Oh many a night at the bowl
 With Larry Ive sot cheek by jowl
 Hes gone to his rest
 Wheres theres dthrink of the best
 And so let us give his old sowl
 A howl
 For twas he made the noggin to rowl




THE ROSE OF FLORA


 Sent by a Young Gentleman of Quality to Miss Brdy of Castle
 Brady


 On Bradys tower there grows a flower
 It is the loveliest flower that blows
 At Castle Brady there lives a lady
 And how I love her no one knows
 Her name is Nora and the goddess Flora
 Presents her with this blooming rose

 O Lady Nora says the goddess Flora
 Ive many a rich and bright parterre
 In Bradys towers theres seven more flowers
 But youre the fairest lady there
 Not all the county nor Irelands bounty
 Can projuice a treasure thats half so fair

 What cheek is redder sure roses fed her
 Her hair is maregolds and her eye of blew
 Beneath her eyelid is like the vilet
 That darkly glistens with gentle jew
 The lilys nature is not surely whiter
 Than Noras neck isand her arrums too

 Come gentle Nora says the goddess Flora
 My dearest creature take my advice
 There is a poet full well you know it
 Who spends his lifetime in heavy sighs
 Young Redmond Barry tis him youll marry
 If rhyme and raisin youd choose likewise




THE LAST IRISH GRIEVANCE


 On reading of the general indignation occasioned in Ireland by the
 appointment of a Scotch Professor to one of HER MAJESTYS Godless
 colleges MASTER MOLLOY MOLONY brother of THADDEUS MOLONY Esq
 of the Temple a youth only fifteen years of age dashed off the
 following spirited lines


 As I think of the insult thats done to this nation
 Red tears of rivinge from me fatures I wash
 And uphold in this pome to the worlds daytistation
 The sleeves that appointed PROFESSOR MCOSH

 I look round me counthree renowned by exparience
 And see midst her childthren the witty the wise
 Whole hayps of logicians potes schollars grammarians
 All ayger for pleeces all panting to rise

 I gaze round the world in its utmost diminsion
 LARD JAHN and his minions in Council I ask
 Was there ever a Governmentpleece with a pinsion
 But children of Erin were fit for that task

 What Erin beloved is thy fetal condition
 What shame in aych boosom must rankle and burrun
 To think that our countree has neer a logician
 In the hour of her deenger will surrev her turrun

 On the logic of Saxons theres little reliance
 And rather from Saxons than gather its rules
 Id stamp under feet the base book of his science
 And spit on his chair as he taught in the schools

 O false SIR JOHN KANE is it thus that you praych me
 I think all your Queens Universitees Bosh
 And if youve no neetive Professor to taych me
 I scawurn to be learned by the Saxon MCOSH

 Theres WISEMAN and CHUME and His Grace the Lord Primate
 That sinds round the box and the world will subscribe
 Tis theyll build a College thats fit for our climate
 And taych me the saycrets I burn to imboibe

 Tis there as a Student of Science Ill enther
 Fair Fountain of Knowledge of Joy and Contint
 SAINT PATHRICKS sweet Statue shall stand in the centher
 And wink his dear oi every day during Lint

 And good Doctor NEWMAN that praycher unwary
 Tis he shall preside the Academee School
 And quit the gay robe of ST PHILIP of Neri
 To wield the soft rod of ST LAWRENCE OTOOLE





THE BALLADS OF POLICEMAN X




THE WOLFE NEW BALLAD OF JANE RONEY AND MARY BROWN


 An igstrawnary tail I vill tell you this veek
 I stood in the Court of ABeckett the Beak
 Vere Mrs Jane Roney a vidow I see
 Who charged Mary Brown with a robbin of she

 This Mary was pore and in misery once
 And she came to Mrs Roney its more than twelve monce
 She adnt got no bed nor no dinner nor no tea
 And kind Mrs Roney gave Mary all three

 Mrs Roney kep Mary for ever so many veeks
 Her conduct disgusted the best of all Beax
 She kep her for nothink as kind as could be
 Never thinkin that this Mary was a traitor to she

 Mrs Roney O Mrs Roney I feel very ill
 Will you just step to the Doctors for to fetch me a pill
 That I will my pore Mary Mrs Roney says she
 And she goes off to the Doctors as quickly as may be

 No sooner on this message Mrs Roney was sped
 Than hup gits vicked Mary and jumps out a bed
 She hopens all the trunks without never a key
 She bustes all the boxes and vith them makes free

 Mrs Roneys best linning gownds petticoats and close
 Her childrens little coats and things her boots and her hose
 She packed them and she stole em and avay vith them did flee
 Mrs Roneys situationyou may think vat it vould be

 Of Mary ungrateful who had served her this vay
 Mrs Roney heard nothink for a long year and a day
 Till last Thursday in Lambeth ven whom should she see
 But this Mary as had acted so ungrateful to she

 She was leaning on the helbo of a worthy young man
 They were going to be married and were walkin hand in hand
 And the Church bells was a ringing for Mary and he
 And the parson was ready and a waitin for his fee

 When up comes Mrs Roney and faces Mary Brown
 Who trembles and castes her eyes upon the ground
 She calls a jolly pleaseman it happens to be me
 I charge this yonng woman Mr Pleaseman says she

 Mrs Roney O Mrs Roney O do let me go
 I acted most ungrateful I own and I know
 But the marriage bell is a ringin and the ring you may see
 And this young man is a waitin says Mary says she

 I dont care three fardens for the parson and clark
 And the bell may keep ringin from noon day to dark
 Mary Brown Mary Brown you must come along with me
 And I think this young man is lucky to be free

 So in spite of the tears which bejewd Marys cheek
 I took that young gurl to ABeckett the Beak
 That exlent Justice demanded her plea
 But never a sullable said Mary said she

 On account of her conduck so base and so vile
 That wicked young gurl is committed for trile
 And if shes transpawted beyond the salt sea
 Its a proper reward for such willians as she

 Now you young gurls of Southwark for Mary who veep
 From pickin and stealin your ands you must keep
 Or it may be my dooty as it was Thursday veek
 To pull you all hup to ABeckett the Beak




THE THREE CHRISTMAS WAITS


 My name is Pleaceman X
 Last night I was in bed
 A dream did me perplex
 Which came into my Edd
 I dreamed I sor three Waits
 A playing of their tune
 At Pimlico Palace gates
 All underneath the moon
 One puffed a hold French horn
 And one a hold Banjo
 And one chap seedy and torn
 A Hirish pipe did blow
 They sadly piped and played
 Dexcribing of their fates
 And this was what they said
 Those three pore Christmas Waits

 When this black year began
 This Eighteenfortyeight
 I was a great great man
 And king both vise and great
 And Munseer Guizot by me did show
 As Minister of State

 But Febuwerry came
 And brought a rabble rout
 And me and my good dame
 And children did turn out
 And us in spite of all our right
 Sent to the right about

 I left my native ground
 I left my kin and kith
 I left my royal crownd
 Vich I couldnt travel vith
 And without a pound came to English ground
 In the name of Mr Smith

 Like any anchorite
 Ive lived since I came here
 Ive kep myself quite quite
 Ive drank the small small beer
 And the vater you see disagrees vith me
 And all my famly dear

 O Tweeleries so dear
 O darling Pally Royl
 Vas it to finish here
 That I did trouble and toyl
 That all my plans should break in my ands
 And should on me recoil

 My state I fenced about
 Vith baynicks and vith guns
 My gals I portioned hout
 Rich vives I got my sons
 O varnt it crule to lose my rule
 My money and lands at once

 And so vith arp and woice
 Both troubled and shagreened
 I hid you to rejoice
 O glorious Englands Queend
 And never have to veep like pore LouisPhileep
 Because you out are cleaned

 O Prins so brave and stout
 I stand before your gate
 Pray send a trifle hout
 To me your pore old Vait
 For nothink could be vuss than its been along vith us
 In this year Fortyeight

 Ven this bad year began
 The nex man said seysee
 I vas a Journeyman
 A taylor black and free
 And my wife went out and chaired about
 And my names the bold Cuffee

 The Queen and Halbert both
 I swore I would confound
 I took a hawfle hoath
 To drag them to the ground
 And sevral more with me they swore
 Aginst the British Crownd

 Aginst her Pleacemen all
 We said wed try our strenth
 Her scarlick soldiers tall
 We vowd wed lay full lenth
 And out we came in Freedoms name
 Last Aypril was the tenth

 Three undred thousand snobs
 Came out to stop the vay
 Vith sticks vith iron knobs
 Or else wed gained the day
 The harmy quite kept out of sight
 And so ve vent avay

 Next day the Pleacemen came
 Rewenge it was their plann
 And from my good old dame
 They took her tailormann
 And the hard hard beak did me bespeak
 To Newgit in the Wann

 In that etrocious Cort
 The Jewry did agree
 The Judge did me transport
 To go beyond the sea
 And so for life from his dear wife
 They took poor old Cuffee

 O Halbert Appy Prince
 With children round your knees
 Ingraving ansum Prints
 And taking hoff your hease
 O think of me the old Cuffee
 Beyond the solt solt seas

 Although Im hold and black
 My hanguish is most great
 Great Prince O call me back
 And I vill be your Vait
 And never no more vill break the Lor
 As I did in Fortyeight

 The tailer thus did close
 A pore old blackymore rogue
 When a dismal gent uprose
 And spoke with Hirish brogue
 Im Smith OBrine of Royal Line
 Descended from Rory Ogue

 When great OConnle died
 That man whom all did trust
 That man whom Henglish pride
 Beheld with such disgust
 Then Erin free fixed eyes on me
 And swoar I should be fust

 The glorious Hirish Crown
 Says she it shall be thine
 Long time its wery well known
 You kep it in your line
 That diadem of hemerald gem
 Is yours my Smith OBrine

 Too long the Saxon churl
 Our land encumbered hath
 Arise my Prince my Earl
 And brush them from thy path
 Rise mighty Smith and sveep em vith
 The besom of your wrath

 Then in my might I rose
 My country I surveyed
 I saw it filled with foes
 I viewed them undismayed
 Ha ha says I the harvests high
 Ill reap it with my blade

 My warriors I enrolled
 They rallied round their lord
 And cheafs in council old
 I summoned to the board
 Wise Doheny and Duffy bold
 And Meagher of the Sword

 I stood on Slievenamaun
 They came with pikes and bills
 They gathered in the dawn
 Like mist upon the hills
 And rushed adown the mountain side
 Like twenty thousand rills

 Their fortress we assail
 Hurroo my boys hurroo
 The bloody Saxons quail
 To hear the wild Shaloo
 Strike and prevail proud Innesfail
 OBrine aboo aboo

 Our people they defied
 They shot at em like savages
 Their bloody guns they plied
 With sanguinary ravages
 Hide blushing Glory hide
 That day among the cabbages

 And so no more Ill say
 But ask your Mussy great
 And humbly sing and pray
 Your Majestys poor Wait
 Your Smith OBrine in Fortynine
 Will blush for Fortyeight




LINES ON A LATE HOSPICIOUS EWENT

 BY A GENTLEMAN OF THE FOOTGUARDS BLUE


 I paced upon my beat
 With steady step and slow
 All huppandownd of Ranelagh Street
 Ranlagh St Pimlico

 While marching huppandownd
 Upon that fair May morn
 Beold the booming cannings sound
 A royal child is born

 The Ministers of State
 Then presnly I sor
 They gallops to the Pallis gate
 In carridges and for

 With anxious looks intent
 Before the gate they stop
 There comes the good Lord President
 And there the Archbishopp

 Lord John he next elights
 And who comes here in haste
 Tis the ero of one underd fights
 The caudle for to taste

 Then Mrs Lily the nuss
 Towards them steps with joy
 Says the brave old Duke Come tell to us
 Is it a gal or a boy

 Says Mrs L to the Duke
 Your Grace it is A PRINCE
 And at that nusss bold rebuke
 He did both laugh and wince

 He vews with pleasant look
 This pooty flower of May
 Then says the wenarable Duke
 Egad its my buthday

 By memory backwards borne
 Peraps his thoughts did stray
 To that old place where he was born
 Upon the first of May

 Perhaps he did recal
 The ancient towers of Trim
 And County Meath and Dangan Hall
 They did rewisit him

 I phansy of him so
 His good old thoughts employin
 Fourscore years and one ago
 Beside the flowin Boyne

 His father praps he sees
 Most Musicle of Lords
 A playing maddrigles and glees
 Upon the Arpsicords

 Jest phansy this old Ero
 Upon his mothers knee
 Did ever lady in this land
 Ave greater sons than she

 And I shoudn be surprize
 While this was in his mind
 If a drop there twinkled in his eyes
 Of unfamiliar brind

     

 To Hapsly Ouse next day
 Drives up a Broosh and for
 A gracious prince sits in that Shay
 I mention him with Hor

 They ring upon the bell
 The Porter shows his Ed
 He fought at Vaterloo as vell
 And vears a Veskit red

 To see that carriage come
 The people round it press
 And is the galliant Duke at ome
 Your Royal Ighness yes

 He stepps from out the Broosh
 And in the gate is gone
 And X although the people push
 Says wary kind Move hon

 The Royal Prince unto
 The galliant Duke did say
 Dear duke my little son and you
 Was born the self same day

 The Lady of the land
 My wife and Sovring dear
 It is by her horgust command
 I wait upon you here

 That lady is as well
 As can expected be
 And to your Grace she bid me tell
 This gracious message free

 That offspring of our race
 Whom yesterday you see
 To show our honor for your Grace
 Prince Arthur he shall be

 That name it rhymes to fame
 All Europe knows the sound
 And I couldnt find a better name
 If youd give me twenty pound

 King Arthur had his knights
 That girt his table round
 But you have won a hundred fights
 Will match em Ill be bound

 You fought with Bonypart
 And likewise Tippoo Saib
 I name you then with all my heart
 The Godsire of this babe

 That Prince his leave was took
 His hinterview was done
 So let us give the good old Duke
 Good luck of his godson

 And wish him years of joy
 In this our time of Schism
 And hope hell hear the royal boy
 His little catechism

 And my pooty little Prince
 Thats come our arts to cheer
 Let me my loyal powers ewince
 A welcomin of you ere

 And the PoitLaureats crownd
 I think in some respex
 Egstremely shootable might be found
 For honest Pleaseman X

DAMAGES TWO HUNDRED POUNDS


 Special Jurymen of England who admire your countrys laws
 And proclaim a British Jury worthy of the realms applause
 Gayly compliment each other at the issue of a cause
 Which was tried at Guildford sizes this day week as ever was

 Unto that august tribunal comes a gentleman in grief
 Special was the British Jury and the Judge the Baron Chief
 Comes a British man and husbandasking of the law relief
 For his wife was stolen from himhed have vengeance on the thief

 Yes his wife the blessed treasure with the which his life was
 crowned
 Wickedly was ravished from him by a hypocrite profound
 And he comes before twelve Britons men for sense and truth renowned
 To award him for his damage twenty hundred sterling pound

 He by counsel and attorney there at Guildford does appear
 Asking damage of the villain who seduced his lady dear
 But I cant help asking though the ladys guilt was all too clear
 And though guilty the defendant wasnt the plaintiff rather queer

 First the ladys mother spoke and said shed seen her daughter cry
 But a fortnight after marriage early times for piping eye
 Six months after things were worse and the piping eye was black
 And this gallant British husband caned his wife upon the back

 Three months after they were married husband pushed her to the door
 Told her to be off and leave him for he wanted her no more
 As she would not go why HE went thrice he left his lady dear
 Left her too without a penny for more than a quarter of a year

 Mrs Frances Duncan knew the parties very well indeed
 She had seen him pull his ladys nose and make her lip to bleed
 If he chanced to sit at home not a single word he said
 Once she saw him throw the cover of a dish at his ladys head

 Sarah Green another witness clear did to the jury note
 How she saw this honest fellow seize his lady by the throat
 How he cursed her and abused her beating her into a fit
 Till the pitying nextdoor neighbors crossed the wall and witnessed it

 Next door to this injured Briton Mr Owers a butcher dwelt
 Mrs Owerss foolish heart towards this erring dame did melt
 Not that she had erred as yet crime was not developed in her
 But being left without a penny Mrs Owers supplied her dinner
 God be merciful to Mrs Owers who was merciful to this sinner

 Caroline Naylor was their servant said they led a wretched life
 Saw this most distinguished Briton fling a teacup at his wife
 He went out to balls and pleasures and never once in ten months
 space
 Sat with his wife or spoke her kindly This was the defendants
 case

 Pollock CB charged the Jury said the womans guilt was clear
 That was not the point however which the Jury came to hear
 But the damage to determine which as it should true appear
 This most tenderhearted husband who so used his lady dear

 Beat her kicked her caned her cursed her left her starving
 year by year
 Flung her from him parted from her wrung her neck and boxed her
 ear
 What the reasonable damage this afflicted man could claim
 By the loss of the affections of this guilty graceless dame

 Then the honest British Twelve to each other turning round
 Laid their clever heads together with a wisdom most profound
 And towards his Lordship looking spoke the foreman wise and sound
 My Lord we find for this here plaintiff damages two hundred
 pound

 So God bless the Special Jury pride and joy of English ground
 And the happy land of England where true justice does abound
 British jurymen and husbands let us hail this verdict proper
 If a British wife offends you Britons youve a right to whop her

 Though you promised to protect her though you promised to defend her
 You are welcome to neglect her to the devil you may send her
 You may strike her curse abuse her so declares our law renowned
 And if after this you lose herwhy youre paid two hundred pound




THE KNIGHT AND THE LADY


 Theres in the Vest a city pleasant
 To vich King Bladud gev his name
 And in that city theres a Crescent
 Vere dwelt a noble knight of fame

 Although that galliant knight is oldish
 Although Sir John as gray gray air
 Hage has not made his busum coldish
 His Art still beats tewodds the Fair

 Twas two years sins this knight so splendid
 Peraps fateagued with Baths routines
 To Paris towne his phootsteps bended
 In sutch of gayer folks and seans

 His and was free his means was easy
 A nobler finer gent than he
 Neer drove about the ShonsEleesy
 Or paced the Roo de Rivolee

 A brougham and pair Sir John prowided
 In which abroad he loved to ride
 But ar he most of all enjyed it
 When some one helse was sittin inside

 That some one helse a lovely dame was
 Dear ladies you will heasy tell
 Countess Grabrowski her sweet name was
 A noble title ard to spell

 This faymus Countess ad a daughter
 Of lovely form and tender art
 A nobleman in marridge sought her
 By name the Baron of Saint Bart

 Their pashn touched the noble Sir John
 It was so pewer and profound
 Lady Grabrowski he did urge on
 With Hymings wreeth their loves to crownd

 O come to Bath to Lansdowne Crescent
 Says kind Sir John and live with me
 The living theres uncommon pleasant
 Im sure youll find the hair agree

 O come to Bath my fair Grabrowski
 And bring your charming girl sezee
 The Barring here shall have the ousekey
 Vith breakfast dinner lunch and tea

 And when theyve passed an appy winter
 Their opes and loves no more well bar
 The marridgevow theyll enter inter
 And I at church will be their Par

 To Bath they went to Lansdowne Crescent
 Where good Sir John he did provide
 No end of teas and balls incessant
 And hosses both to drive and ride

 He was so Ospitably busy
 When Miss was late hed make so bold
 Upstairs to call out Missy Missy
 Come down the coffys getting cold

 But O tis sadd to think such bounties
 Should meet with such return as this
 O Barring of Saint Bart O Countess
 Grabrowski and O cruel Miss

 He married you at Baths fair Habby
 Saint Bart he treated like a son
 And wasnt it uncommon shabby
 To do what you have went and done

 My trembling And amost refewses
 To write the charge which Sir John swore
 Of which the Countess he ecuses
 Her daughter and her soninlore

 My Mews quite blushes as she sings of
 The fatle charge which now I quote
 He says Miss took his two best rings off
 And pawned em for a tenpun note

 Is this the child of honest parince
 To make away with folks best things
 Is this pray like the wives of Barrins
 To go and prig a gentlemans rings

 Thus thought Sir John by anger wrought on
 And to rewenge his injured cause
 He brought them hup to Mr Broughton
 Last Vensday veek as ever waws

 If guiltless how she have been slandered
 If guilty wengeance will not fail
 Meanwhile the lady is remanded
 And gev three hundred pouns in bail




JACOB HOMNIUMS HOSS

 A NEW PALLICE COURT CHANT


 One sees in Viteall Yard
 Vere pleacemen do resort
 A wenerable hinstitute
 Tis calld the Pallis Court
 A gent as got his i on it
 I think twill make some sport

 The natur of this Court
 My hindignation riles
 A few fat legal spiders
 Here set  spin their viles
 To rob the town theyr privlege is
 In a hayrea of twelve miles

 The Judge of this year Court
 Is a mellitary beak
 He knows no more of Lor
 Than praps he does of Greek
 And prowides hisself a deputy
 Because he cannot speak

 Four counsel in this Court
 Misnamed of Justicesits
 These lawyers owes their places to
 Their money not their wits
 And theres six attornies under them
 As here their living gits

 These lawyers six and four
 Was a livin at their ease
 A sendin of their writs abowt
 And droring in the fees
 When their erose a cirkimstance
 As is like to make a breeze

 It now is some monce since
 A gent both good and trew
 Possest an ansum oss vith vich
 He didn know what to do
 Peraps he did not like the oss
 Peraps he was a scru

 This gentleman his oss
 At Tattersalls did lodge
 There came a wulgar ossdealer
 This gentlemans name did fodge
 And took the oss from Tattersalls
 Wasn that a artful dodge

 One day this gentlemans groom
 This willain did spy out
 A mounted on this oss
 A ridin him about
 Get out of that there oss you rogue
 Speaks up the groom so stout

 The thief was cruel whexd
 To find himself so pinnd
 The oss began to whinny
 The honest gloom he grinnd
 And the raskle thief got off the oss
 And cut avay like vind

 And phansy with what joy
 The master did regard
 His dearly bluvd lost oss again
 Trot in the stable yard

 Who was this master good
 Of whomb I makes these rhymes
 His name is Jacob Homnium Exquire
 And if Id committed crimes
 Good Lord I wouldnt ave that mann
 Attack me in the Times

 Now shortly after the groomb
 His masters oss did take up
 There came a liveryman
 This gentleman to wake up
 And he handed in a little bill
 Which hangered Mr Jacob

 For two pound seventeen
 This liveryman eplied
 For the keep of Mr Jacobs oss
 Which the thief had took to ride
 Do you see anythink green in me
 Mr Jacob Homnium cried

 Because a raskle chews
 My oss away to robb
 And goes tick at your Mews
 For sevenandfifty bobb
 Shall I be calld to payIt is
 A iniquitious Jobb

 Thus Mr Jacob cut
 The conwasation short
 The liveryman went ome
 Detummingd to ave sport
 And summingsd Jacob Homnium Exquire
 Into the Pallis Court

 Pore Jacob went to Court
 A Counsel for to fix
 And choose a barrister out of the four
 An attorney of the six
 And there he sor these men of Lor
 And watchd em at their tricks

 The dreadful day of trile
 In the Pallis Court did come
 The lawyers said their say
 The Judge lookd wery glum
 And then the British Jury cast
 Pore Jacob Homnium

 O a weary day was that
 For Jacob to go through
 The debt was two seventeen
 Which he no mor owed than you
 And then there was the plaintives costs
 Eleven pound six and two

 And then there was his own
 Which the lawyers they did fix
 At the wery moderit figgar
 Of ten pound one and six
 Now Evins bless the Pallis Court
 And all its bold verdicks

 I cannot settingly tell
 If Jacob swaw and cust
 At aving for to pay this sumb
 But I should think he must
 And av drawn a cheque for L24 4s 8d
 With most igstreme disgust

 O Pallis Court you move
 My pitty most profound
 A most emusing sport
 You thought it Ill be bound
 To saddle hup a threepound debt
 With twoandtwenty pound

 Good sport it is to you
 To grind the honest pore
 To pay their just or unjust debts
 With eight hundred per cent for Lor
 Make haste and get your costes in
 They will not last much mor

 Come down from that tribewn
 Thou shameless and Unjust
 Thou Swindle picking pockets in
 The name of Truth august
 Come down thou hoary blasphemy
 For die thou shalt and must

 And go it Jacob Homnium
 And ply your iron pen
 And rise up Sir John Jervis
 And shut me up that den
 That sty for fattening lawyers in
 On the bones of honest men

 PLEACEMAN X




THE SPECULATORS


 The night was stormy and dark
 The town was shut up in sleep
 Only those were abroad who were out on a lark
 Or those whod no beds to keep

 I passd through the lonely street
 The wind did sing and blow
 I could hear the policemans feet
 Clapping to and fro

 There stood a potatoman
 In the midst of all the wet
 He stood with his tatocan
 In the lonely Haymarket

 Two gents of dismal mien
 And dank and greasy rags
 Came out of a shop for gin
 Swaggering over the flags

 Swaggering over the stones
 These shabby bucks did walk
 And I went and followed those seedy ones
 And listened to their talk

 Was I sober or awake
 Could I believe my ears
 Those dismal beggars spake
 Of nothing but railroad shares

 I wondered more and more
 Says oneGood friend of mine
 How many shares have you wrote for
 In the Diddlesex Junction line

 I wrote for twenty says Jim
 But they wouldnt give me one
 His comrade straight rebuked him
 For the folly he had done

 O Jim you are unawares
 Of the ways of this bad town
 I always write for five hundred shares
 And THEN they put me down

 And yet you got no shares
 Says Jim for all your boast
 I WOULD have wrote says Jack but where
 Was the penny to pay the post

 I lost for I couldnt pay
 That first instalment up
 But heres taters smoking hotI say
 Lets stop my boy and sup

 And at this simple feast
 The while they did regale
 I drew each ragged capitalist
 Down on my left thumbnail

 Their talk did me perplex
 All night I tumbled and tost
 And thought of railroad specs
 And how money was won and lost

 Bless railroads everywhere
 I said and the worlds advance
 Bless every railroad share
 In Italy Ireland France
 For never a beggar need now despair
 And every rogue has a chance




A WOEFUL NEW BALLAD

 OF THE PROTESTANT CONSPIRACY TO TAKE THE POPES LIFE

 BY A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS BEEN ON THE SPOT


 Come all ye Christian people unto my tale give ear
 Tis about a base consperracy as quickly shall appear
 Twill make your hair to bristle up and your eyes to start and glow
 When of this dread consperracy you honest folks shall know

 The news of this consperracy and villianous attempt
 I read it in a newspaper from Italy it was sent
 It was sent from lovely Italy where the olives they do grow
 And our holy father lives yes yes while his name it is No NO

 And tis there our English noblemen goes that is Puseyites no
 longer
 Because they finds the ancient faith both better is and stronger
 And tis there I knelt beside my lord when he kissd the POPE his
 toe
 And hung his neck with chains at St Peters Vinculo

 And tis there the splendid churches is and the fountains playing
 grand
 And the palace of PRINCE TORLONIA likewise the Vatican
 And theres the stairs where the bagpipemen and the piffararys
 blow
 And its there I drove my lady and lord in the Park of Pincio

 And tis there our splendid churches is in all their pride and
 glory
 Saint Peters famous Basilisk and Saint Marys Maggiory
 And them benighted Prodestants on Sunday they must go
 Outside the town to the preachingshop by the gate of Popolo

 Now in this town of famous Room as I dessay you have heard
 There is scarcely any gentleman as hasnt got a beard
 And ever since the world began it was ordained so
 That there should always barbers he wheresumever beards do grow

 And as it always has been so since the world it did begin
 The POPE our Holy Potentate has a beard upon his chin
 And every morning regular when cocks begin to crow
 There comes a certing party to wait on POPE PIO

 There comes a certing gintlemen with razier soap and lather
 A shaving most respectfully the POPE our Holy Father
 And now the dread consperracy Ill quickly to you show
 Which them sanguinary Prodestants did form against NONO

 Them sanguinary Prodestants which I abore and hate
 Assembled in the preachingshop by the Flaminian gate
 And they took counsel with their selves to deal a deadly blow
 Against our gentle Father the Holy POPE PIO

 Exhibiting a wickedness which I never heard or read of
 What do you think them Prodestants wished to cut the good Popes
 head off
 And to the kind POPES Airdresser the Prodestant Clark did go
 And proposed him to decapitate the innocent PIO

 What hever can be easier said this Clerkthis Man of Sin
 When you are called to hoperate on His Holinesss chin
 Than just to give the razier a little slipjust so
 And theres an end dear barber of innocent PIO

 The wicked conversation it chanced was overerd
 By an Italian lady she heard it every word
 Which by birth she was a Marchioness in service forced to go
 With the parson of the preachingshop at the gate of Popolo

 When the lady heard the news as duty did obleege
 As fast as her legs could carry her she ran to the Poleege
 O Polegia says she for they pronounts it so
 Theyre going for to massyker our Holy POPE PIO

 The ebomminable Englishmen the Parsing and his Clark
 His Holinesss Airdresser devised it in the dark
 And I would recommend you in prison for to throw
 These villians would esassinate the Holy POPE PIO

 And for saving of His Holiness and his trebble crownd
 I humbly hope your Worships will give me a few pound
 Because I was a Marchioness many years ago
 Before I came to service at the gate of Popolo

 That sackreligious Airdresser the Parson and his man
 Wouldnt though askd continyally own their wicked plan
 And so the kind Authoraties let those villians go
 That was plotting of the murder of the good PIO NONO

 Now isnt this safishnt proof ye gentlemen at home
 How wicked is them Prodestants and how good our Pope at Rome
 So let us drink confusion to LORD JOHN and LORD MINTO
 And a health unto His Eminence and good PIO NONO




THE LAMENTABLE BALLAD OF THE FOUNDLING OF SHOREDITCH


 Come all ye Christian people and listen to my tail
 It is all about a doctor was travelling by the rail
 By the Heastern Counties Railway vich the shares I dont desire
 From Ixworth town in Suffolk vich his name did not transpire

 A travelling from Bury this Doctor was employed
 With a gentleman a friend of his vich his name was Captain Loyd
 And on reaching Marks Tey Station that is next beyond Colchest
 er a lady entered into them most elegantly dressed

 She entered into the Carriage all with a tottering step
 And a pooty little Bayby upon her bussum slep
 The gentlemen received her with kindness and siwillaty
 Pitying this lady for her illness and debillaty

 She had a fustclass ticket this lovely lady said
 Because it was so lonesome she took a secknd instead
 Better to travel by secknd class than sit alone in the fust
 And the pooty little Baby upon her breast she nust

 A seein of her cryin and shiverin and pail
 To her spoke this surging the Ero of my tail
 Saysee you look unwell Maam Ill elp you if I can
 And you may tell your ease to me for Im a meddicle man

 Thank you Sir the lady said I only look so pale
 Because I aint accustomd to travelling on the Rale
 I shall be better presnly when Ive ad some rest
 And that pooty little Baby she squeeged it to her breast

 So in the conwersation the journey they beguiled
 Capting Loyd and the meddicle man and the lady and the child
 Till the warious stations along the line was passed
 For even the Heastern Counties trains must come in at last

 When at Shoreditch tumminus at lenth stopped the train
 This kind meddicle gentleman proposed his aid again
 Thank you Sir the lady said for your kyindness dear
 My carridge and my osses is probibbly come here

 Will you old this baby please vilst I step and see
 The Doctor was a famly man That I will says he
 Then the little child she kist kist it very gently
 Vich was sucking his little fist sleeping innocently

 With a sigh from her art as though she would have bust it
 Then she gave the Doctor the childwery kind he nust it
 Hup then the lady jumped hoff the bench she sat from
 Tumbled down the carridge steps and ran along the platform

 Vile hall the other passengers vent upon their vays
 The Capting and the Doctor sat there in a maze
 Some vent in a Homminibus some vent in a Cabby
 The Capting and the Doctor vaited vith the babby

 There they sat looking queer for an hour or more
 But their feller passinger neather on em sore
 Never never back again did that lady come
 To that pooty sleeping Hinfnt a suckin of his Thum

 What could this pore Doctor do bein treated thus
 When the darling Baby woke cryin for its nuss
 Off he drove to a female friend vich she was both kind and mild
 And igsplained to her the circumstance of this year little child

 That kind lady took the child instantly in her lap
 And made it very comfortable by giving it some pap
 And when she took its close off what dyou think she found
 A couple of ten pun notes sewn up in its little gownd

 Also in its little close was a note which did conwey
 That this little babys parents lived in a handsome way
 And for his Headucation they reglarly would pay
 And sirtingly like gentlefolks would claim the child one day
 If the Christian people whod charge of it would say
 Per adwertisement in The Times where the baby lay

 Pity of this bayy many people took
 It had such pooty ways and such a pooty look
 And there came a lady forrard I wish that I could see
 Any kind lady as would do as much for me

 And I wish with all my art some night in MY night gownd
 I could find a note stitched for ten or twenty pound
 There came a lady forrard that most honorable did say
 Shed adopt this little baby which her parents cast away

 While the Doctor pondered on this hoffer fair
 Comes a letter from Devonshire from a party there
 Hordering the Doctor at its Mars desire
 To send the little Infant back to Devonshire

 Lost in apoplexity this pore meddicle man
 Like a sensable gentleman to the Justice ran
 Which his name was Mr Hammill a honorable beak
 That takes his seat in Worship Street four times a week

 O Justice says the Doctor instrugt me what to do
 Ive come up from the country to throw myself on you
 My patients have no doctor to tend them in their ills
 There they are in Suffolk without their drafts and pills

 Ive come up from the country to know how Ill dispose
 Of this pore little baby and the twenty pun note and the close
 And I want to go back to Suffolk dear Justice if you please
 And my patients wants their Doctor and their Doctor wants his feez

 Up spoke Mr Hammill sittin at his desk
 This year application does me much perplesk
 What I do adwise you is to leave this babby
 In the Parish where it was left by its mother shabby

 The Doctor from his worship sadly did depart
 He might have left the baby but he hadnt got the heart
 To go for to leave that Hinnocent has the law allows
 To the tender mussies of the Union House

 Mother who left this little one on a strangers knee
 Think how cruel you have been and how good was he
 Think if youve been guilty innocent was she
 And do not take unkindly this little word of me
 Heaven be merciful to us all sinners as we be




THE ORGANBOYS APPEAL


 WESTMINSTER POLICE COURTPoliceman X brought a paper of doggerel
 verses to the MAGISTRATE which had been thrust into his hands X
 said by an Italian boy who ran away immediately afterwards

 The MAGISTRATE after perusing the lines looked hard at X and
 said he did not think they were written by an Italian

 X blushing said he thought the paper read in Court last week
 and which frightened so the old gentleman to whom it was addressed
 was also not of Italian origin


 O SIGNOR BRODERIP you are a wickid ole man
 You wexis us little horginboys whenever you can
 How dare you talk of Justice and go for to seek
 To pussicute us horginboys you senguinary Beek

 Though you set in Vestminster surrounded by your crushers
 Harrogint and habsolute like the Hortocrat of hall the Rushers
 Yet there is a better vurld Id have you for to know
 Likewise a place vere the henimies of horginboys will go

 O you vickid HEROD without any pity
 London vithout horginboys vood be a dismal city
 Sweet SAINT CICILY who first taught horginpipes to blow
 Soften the heart of this Magistrit that haggerywates us so

 Good Italian gentlemen fatherly and kind
 Brings us over to London here our horgins for to grind
 Sends us out vith little vite mice and guineapigs also
 A popping of the Veasel and a Jumpin of JIM CROW

 And as us young horginboys is grateful in our turn
 We gives to these kind gentlemen hall the money we earn
 Because that they vood vop up as wery wel we know
 Unless we brought our hurnings back to them as loves us so

 O MR BRODERIP wery much Im surprise
 Ven you take your valks abroad where can be your eyes
 If a Beak had a heart then youd compryend
 Us pore little horginboys was the poor mans friend

 Dont you see the shildren in the droringrooms
 Clapping of their little ands when they year our toons
 On their mothers bussums dont you see the babbies crow
 And down to us dear horginboys lots of apence throw

 Dont you see the ousemaids pooty POLLIES and MARIES
 Ven ve bring our urdigurdis smiling from the hairies
 Then they come out vith a slice o cole puddn or a bit o bacon or so
 And give it us young horginboys for lunch afore we go

 Have you ever seen the Hirish children sport
 When our velcome musicbox brings sunshine in the Court
 To these little paupers who can never pay
 Surely all good horginboys for GODS love will play

 Has for those proud gentlemen like a serting Bk
 Vich I vont be pussonal and therefore vil not speak
 That flings their parlervinders hup von ve begin to play
 And cusses us and swears at us in such a wiolent way

 Instedd of their abewsing and calling hout Poleece
 Let em send out JOHN to us vith sixpence or a shillin apiece
 Then like good young horginboys avay from there well go
 Blessing sweet SAINT CICILY that taught our pipes to blow




LITTLE BILLEE

 AirIl y avait un petit navire


 There were three sailors of Bristol city
 Who took a boat and went to sea
 But first with beef and captains biscuits
 And pickled pork they loaded she

 There was gorging Jack and guzzling Jimmy
 And the youngest he was little Billee
 Now when they got as far as the Equator
 Theyd nothing left but one split pea

 Says gorging Jack to guzzling Jimmy
 I am extremely hungaree
 To gorging Jack says guzzling Jimmy
 Weve nothing left us must eat we

 Says gorging Jack to guzzling Jimmy
 With one another we shouldnt agree
 Theres little Bill hes young and tender
 Were old and tough so lets eat he

 Oh Billy were going to kill and eat you
 So undo the button of your chemie
 When Bill received this information
 He used his pocket handkerchie

 First let me say my catechism
 Which my poor mamy taught to me
 Make haste make haste says guzzling Jimmy
 While Jack pulled out his snickersnee

 So Billy went up to the maintop gallant mast
 And down he fell on his bended knee
 He scarce had come to the twelfth commandment
 When up he jumps Theres land I see

 Jerusalem and Madagascar
 And North and South Amerikee
 Theres the British flag a riding at anchor
 With Admiral Napier KCB

 So when they got aboard of the Admirals
 He hanged fat Jack and flogged Jimmee
 But as for little Bill he made him
 The Captain of a Seventythree

 what is considered to be the correct version




THE END OF THE PLAY


 The play is done the curtain drops
 Slow falling to the prompters bell
 A moment yet the actor stops
 And looks around to say farewell
 It is an irksome word and task
 And when hes laughed and said his say
 He shows as he removes the mask
 A face thats anything but gay

 One word ere yet the evening ends
 Lets close it with a parting rhyme
 And pledge a hand to all young friends
 As fits the merry Christmas time
 On lifes wide scene you too have parts
 That Fate ere long shall bid you play
 Good night with honest gentle hearts
 A kindly greeting go alway

 GoodnightId say the griefs the joys
 Just hinted in this mimic page
 The triumphs and defeats of boys
 Are but repeated in our age
 Id say your woes were not less keen
 Your hopes more vain than those of men
 Your pangs or pleasures of fifteen
 At fortyfive played oer again

 Id say we suffer and we strive
 Not less nor more as men than boys
 With grizzled beards at fortyfive
 As erst at twelve in corduroys
 And if in time of sacred youth
 We learned at home to love and pray
 Pray Heaven that early Love and Truth
 May never wholly pass away

 And in the world as in the school
 Id say how fate may change and shift
 The prize be sometimes with the fool
 The race not always to the swift
 The strong may yield the good may fall
 The great man be a vulgar clown
 The knave be lifted over all
 The kind cast pitilessly down

 Who knows the inscrutable design
 Blessed be He who took and gave
 Why should your mother Charles not mine
 Be weeping at her darlings grave
 We bow to Heaven that willd it so
 That darkly rules the fate of all
 That sends the respite or the blow
 Thats free to give or to recall

 This crowns his feast with wine and wit
 Who brought him to that mirth and state
 His betters see below him sit
 Or hunger hopeless at the gate
 Who bade the mud from Dives wheel
 To spurn the rags of Lazarus
 Come brother in that dust well kneel
 Confessing Heaven that ruled it thus

 So each shall mourn in lifes advance
 Dear hopes dear friends untimely killed
 Shall grieve for many a forfeit chance
 And longing passion unfulfilled
 Amen whatever fate be sent
 Pray God the heart may kindly glow
 Although the head with cares be bent
 And whitened with the winter snow

 Come wealth or want come good or ill
 Let young and old accept their part
 And bow before the Awful Will
 And bear it with an honest heart
 Who misses or who wins the prize
 Go lose or conquer as you can
 But if you fail or if you rise
 Be each pray God a gentleman

 A gentleman or old or young
 Bear kindly with my humble lays
 The sacred chorus first was sung
 Upon the first of Christmas days
 The shepherds heard it overhead
 The joyful angels raised it then
 Glory to Heaven on high it said
 And peace on earth to gentle men

 My song save this is little worth
 I lay the weary pen aside
 And wish you health and love and mirth
 As fits the solemn Christmastide
 As fits the holy Christmas birth
 Be this good friends our carol still
 Be peace on earth be peace on earth
 To men of gentle will


  These verses were printed at the end of a Christmas Book 1848

VANITAS VANITATUM


 How spake of old the Royal Seer
 His text is one I love to treat on
 This life of ours he said is sheer
 Mataiotes Mataioteton

 O Student of this gilded Book
 Declare while musing on its pages
 If truer words were ever spoke
 By ancient or by modern sages

 The various authors names but note
 French Spanish English Russians Germans
 And in the volume polyglot
 Sure you may read a hundred sermons

 What histories of life are here
 More wild than all romancers stories
 What wondrous transformations queer
 What homilies on human glories

 What theme for sorrow or for scorn
 What chronicle of Fates surprises
 Of adverse fortune nobly borne
 Of chances changes ruins rises

 Of thrones upset and sceptres broke
 How strange a record here is written
 Of honors dealt as if in joke
 Of brave desert unkindly smitten

 How low men were and how they rise
 How high they were and how they tumble
 O vanity of vanities
 O laughable pathetic jumble

 Here between honest Janins joke
 And his Turk Excellencys firman
 I write my name upon the book
 I write my nameand end my sermon

 

 O Vanity of vanities
 How wayward the decrees of Fate are
 How very weak the very wise
 How very small the very great are

 What mean these stale moralities
 Sir Preacher from your desk you mumble
 Why rail against the great and wise
 And tire us with your ceaseless grumble

 Pray choose us out another text
 O man morose and narrowminded
 Come turn the pageI read the next
 And then the next and still I find it

 Read here how Wealth aside was thrust
 And Folly set in place exalted
 How Princes footed in the dust
 While lackeys in the saddle vaulted

 Though thrice a thousand years are past
 Since Davids son the sad and splendid
 The weary King Ecclesiast
 Upon his awful tablets penned it

 Methinks the text is never stale
 And life is every day renewing
 Fresh comments on the old old tale
 Of Folly Fortune Glory Ruin

 Hark to the Preacher preaching still
 He lifts his voice and cries his sermon
 Here at St Peters of Cornhill
 As yonder on the Mount of Hermon

 For you and me to heart to take
 O dear beloved brother readers
 Today as when the good King spake
 Beneath the solemn Syrian cedars


  Between a page by Jules Janin and a poem by the Turkish
 Ambassador in Madame de Rs album containing the autographs
 of kings princes poets marshals musicians diplomatists
 statesmen artists and men of letters of all nations
