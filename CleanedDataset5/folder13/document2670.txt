LOVESONGS OF CHILDHOOD

By Eugene Field



To Mrs Belle Angler

Dearest Aunt

Many years ago you used to rock me to sleep cradling me in your
arms and singing me petty songs Surely you have not forgotten
that time and I recall it with tenderness You were very
beautiful then But you are more beautiful now for in the years
that have come and gone since then the joys and the sorrows of
maternity have impressed their saintly grace upon the dear face I
used to kiss and have made your gentle heart gentler still

Beloved lady in memory of years to be recalled only in thought
and in token of my gratitude and affection I bring you these
little lovesongs and reverently I lay them at your feet

Eugene Field
Chicago November 1 1894

THE ROCKABY LADY

 The RockaBy Lady from Hushaby street
 Comes stealing comes creeping
 The poppies they hang from her head to her feet
 And each hath a dream that is tiny and fleet
 She bringeth her poppies to you my sweet
 When she findeth you sleeping

 There is one little dream of a beautiful drum
 Rubadub it goeth
 There is one little dream of a big sugarplum
 And lo thick and fast the other dreams come
 Of popguns that bang and tin tops that hum
 And a trumpet that bloweth

 And dollies peep out of those wee little dreams
 With laughter and singing
 And boats go afloating on silvery streams
 And the stars peekaboo with their own misty gleams
 And up up and up where the Mother Moon beams
 The fairies go winging

 Would you dream all these dreams that are tiny and fleet
 Theyll come to you sleeping
 So shut the two eyes that are weary my sweet
 For the RockaBy Lady from Hushaby street
 With poppies that hang from her head to her feet
 Comes stealing comes creeping




BOOH

 On afternoons when baby boy has had a splendid nap
 And sits like any monarch on his throne in nurses lap
 In some such wise my handkerchief I hold before my face
 And cautiously and quietly I move about the place
 Then with a cry I suddenly expose my face to view
 And you should hear him laugh and crow when I say Booh

 Sometimes the rascal tries to make believe that he is scared
 And really when I first began he stared and stared and stared
 And then his under lip came out and farther out it came
 Till mamma and the nurse agreed it was a cruel shame
 But now what does that same wee toddling lisping baby do
 But laugh and kick his little heels when I say Booh

 He laughs and kicks his little heels in rapturous glee and then
 In shrill despotic treble bids me do it all aden
 And Iof course I do it for as his progenitor
 It is such pretty pleasant play as this that I am for
 And it is oh such fun I am sure that we shall rue
 The time when we are both too old to play the game Booh




GARDEN AND CRADLE

 When our babe he goeth walking in his garden
 Around his tinkling feet the sunbeams play
 The posies they are good to him
 And bow them as they should to him
 As fareth he upon his kingly way
 And birdlings of the wood to him
 Make music gentle music all the day
 When our babe he goeth walking in his garden

 When our babe he goeth swinging in his cradle
 Then the night it looketh ever sweetly down
 The little stars are kind to him
 The moon she hath a mind to him
 And layeth on his head a golden crown
 And singeth then the wind to him
 A song the gentle song of Bethlemtown
 When our babe he goeth swinging in his cradle




THE NIGHT WIND

 Have you ever heard the wind go Yooooo
 T is a pitiful sound to hear
 It seems to chill you through and through
 With a strange and speechless fear
 T is the voice of the night that broods outside
 When folk should be asleep
 And many and manys the time Ive cried
 To the darkness brooding far and wide
 Over the land and the deep
 Whom do you want O lonely night
 That you wail the long hours through
 And the night would say in its ghostly way
 Yoooooooo
 Yoooooooo
 Yoooooooo

 My mother told me long ago
 When I was a little tad
 That when the night went wailing so
 Somebody had been bad
 And then when I was snug in bed
 Whither I had been sent
 With the blankets pulled up round my head
 Id think of what my motherd said
 And wonder what boy she meant
 And Whos been bad today Id ask
 Of the wind that hoarsely blew
 And the voice would say in its meaningful way
 Yoooooooo
 Yoooooooo
 Yoooooooo

 That this was true I must allow
 Youll not believe it though
 Yes though Im quite a model now
 I was not always so
 And if you doubt what things I say
 Suppose you make the test
 Suppose when youve been bad some day
 And up to bed are sent away
 From mother and the rest
 Suppose you ask Who has been bad
 And then youll hear whats true
 For the wind will moan in its ruefulest tone
 Yoooooooo
 Yoooooooo
 Yoooooooo




KISSING TIME

 T is when the lark goes soaring
 And the bee is at the bud
 When lightly dancing zephyrs
 Sing over field and flood
 When all sweet things in nature
 Seem joyfully achime
 T is then I wake my darling
 For it is kissing time

 Go pretty lark asoaring
 And suck your sweets O bee
 Sing O ye winds of summer
 Your songs to mine and me
 For with your song and rapture
 Cometh the moment when
 Its halfpast kissing time
 And time to kiss again

 Soso the days go fleeting
 Like golden fancies free
 And every day that cometh
 Is full of sweets for me
 And sweetest are those moments
 My darling comes to climb
 Into my lap to mind me
 That it is kissing time

 Sometimes maybe he wanders
 A heedless aimless way
 Sometimes maybe he loiters
 In pretty prattling play
 But presently bethinks him
 And hastens to me then
 For its halfpast kissing time
 And time to kiss again




JEST FORE CHRISTMAS

 Father calls me William sister calls me Will
 Mother calls me Willie but the fellers call me Bill
 Mighty glad I aint a girlruther be a boy
 Without them sashes curls an things thats worn by Fauntleroy
 Love to chawnk green apples an go swimmin in the lake
 Hate to take the castorile they give for bellyache
 Most all the time the whole year round there aint no flies on me
 But jest fore Christmas Im as good as I kin be

 Got a yeller dog named Sport sick him on the cat
 First thing she knows she doesnt know where she is at
 Got a clipper sled an when us kids goes out to slide
 Long comes the grocery cart an we all hook a ride
 But sometimes when the grocery man is worrited an cross
 He reaches at us with his whip an larrups up his hoss
 An then I laff an holler Oh ye never teched me
 But jest fore Christmas Im as good as I kin be

 Granma says she hopes that when I git to be a man
 Ill be a missionarer like her oldest brother Dan
 As was et up by the cannibuls that lives in Ceylons Isle
 Where every prospeck pleases an only man is vile
 But granma she has never been to see a Wild West show
 Nor read the Life of Daniel Boone or else I guess shed know
 That Bufflo Bill an cowboys is good enough for me
 Excep jest fore Christmas when Im good as I kin be

 And then old Sport he hangs around so solemnlike an still
 His eyes they seem asayin Whats the matter little Bill
 The old cat sneaks down off her perch an wonders whats become
 Of them two enemies of hern that used to make things hum
 But I am so perlite an tend so earnestly to biz
 That mother says to father How improved our Willie is
 But father havin been a boy hisself suspicions me
 When jest fore Christmas Im as good as I kin be

 For Christmas with its lots an lots of candies cakes an toys
 Was made they say for proper kids an not for naughty boys
 So wash yer face an bresh yer hair an mind yer ps and qs
 An dont bust out yer pantaloons and dont wear out yer shoes
 Say Yessum to the ladies an Yessur to the men
 An when theys company dont pass yer plate for pie again
 But thinkin of the things yerd like to see upon that tree
 Jest fore Christmas be as good as yer kin be




BEARD AND BABY

 I say as one who never feared
 The wrath of a subscribers bullet
 I pity him who has a beard
 But has no little girl to pull it

 When wife and I have finished tea
 Our baby woos me with her prattle
 And perching proudly on my knee
 She gives my petted whiskers battle

 With both her hands she tugs away
 While scolding at me kind o spiteful
 Youll not believe me when I say
 I find the torture quite delightful

 No other would presume I ween
 To trifle with this hirsute wonder
 Else would I rise in vengeful mien
 And rend his vandal frame asunder

 But when her baby fingers pull
 This glossy sleek and silky treasure
 My cup of happiness is full
 I fairly glow with pride and pleasure

 And sweeter still through all the day
 I seem to hear her winsome prattle
 I seem to feel her hands at play
 As though they gave me sportive battle

 Yes heavenly music seems to steal
 Where thought of her forever lingers
 And round my heart I always feel
 The twining of her dimpled fingers




THE DINKEY BIRD

 In an ocean way out yonder
 As all sapient people know
 Is the land of WonderWander
 Whither children love to go
 Its their playing romping swinging
 That give great joy to me
 While the DinkeyBird goes singing
 In the amfalula tree

 There the gumdrops grow like cherries
 And taffys thick as peas
 Caramels you pick like berries
 When and where and how you please
 Big red sugarplums are clinging
 To the cliffs beside that sea
 Where the DinkeyBird is singing
 In the amfalula tree

 So when children shout and scamper
 And make merry all the day
 When theres naught to put a damper
 To the ardor of their play
 When I hear their laughter ringing
 Then Im sure as sure can be
 That the DinkeyBird is singing
 In the amfalula tree

 For the DinkeyBirds bravuras
 And staccatos are so sweet
 His roulades appoggiaturas
 And robustos so complete
 That the youth of every nation
 Be they near or far away
 Have especial delectation
 In that gladsome roundelay

 Their eyes grow bright and brighter
 Their lungs begin to crow
 Their hearts get light and lighter
 And their cheeks are all aglow
 For an echo cometh bringing
 The news to all and me
 That the DinkeyBird is singing
 In the amfalula tree

 Im sure you like to go there
 To see your feathered friend
 And so many goodies grow there
 You would like to comprehend
 Speed little dreams your winging
 To that land across the sea
 Where the DinkeyBird is singing
 In the amfalula tree




THE DRUM

 Im a beautiful red red drum
 And I train with the soldier boys
 As up the street we come
 Wonderful is our noise
 Theres Tom and Jim and Phil
 And Dick and Nat and Fred
 While Widow Cutlers Bill
 And I march on ahead
 With a rrrattattat
 And a tumtittyumtumtum
 Oh theres bushels of fun in that
 For boys with a little red drum

 The Injuns came last night
 While the soldiers were abed
 And they gobbled a Chinese kite
 And off to the woods they fled
 The woods are the cherrytrees
 Down in the orchard lot
 And the soldiers are marching to seize
 The booty the Injuns got
 With tumtittyumtumtum
 And rrrattattat
 When soldiers marching come
 Injuns had better scat

 Step up there little Fred
 And Charley have a mind
 Jim is as far ahead
 As you two are behind
 Ready with gun and sword
 Your valorous work to do
 Yonder the Injun horde
 Are lying in wait for you
 And their hearts go pitapat
 When they hear the soldiers come
 With a rrrattattat
 And a tumtittyumtumtum

 Course its all in play
 The skulking Injun crew
 That hustled the kite away
 Are little white boys like you
 But honest or just in fun
 It is all the same to me
 And when the battle is won
 Home once again march we
 With a rrrattattat
 And tumtittyumtumtum
 And theres glory enough in that
 For the boys with their little red drum




THE DEAD BABE

 Last night as my dear babe lay dead
 In agony I knelt and said
 O God what have I done
 Or in what wise offended Thee
 That Thou shouldst take away from me
 My little son

 Upon the thousand useless lives
 Upon the guilt that vaunting thrives
 Thy wrath were better spent
 Why shouldst Thou take my little son
 Why shouldst Thou vent Thy wrath upon
 This innocent

 Last night as my dear babe lay dead
 Before mine eyes the vision spread
 Of things that might have been
 Licentious riot cruel strife
 Forgotten prayers a wasted life
 Dark red with sin

 Then with sweet music in the air
 I saw another vision there
 A Shepherd in whose keep
 A little lambmy little child
 Of worldly wisdom undefiled
 Lay fast asleep

 Last night as my dear babe lay dead
 In those two messages I read
 A wisdom manifest
 And though my arms be childless now
 I am contentto Him I bow
 Who knoweth best




THE HAPPY HOUSEHOLD

 Its when the birds go piping and the daylight slowly breaks
 That clamoring for his dinner our precious baby wakes
 Then its sleep no more for baby and its sleep no more for me
 For when he wants his dinner why its dinner it must be
 And of that lacteal fluid he partakes with great ado
 While granma laughs
 And granpa laughs
 And wife she laughs
 And Iwell I laugh too

 Youd think to see us carrying on about that little tad
 That like as not that baby was the first wed ever had
 But sakes alive he isnt yet we people make a fuss
 As if the only baby in the world had come to us
 And morning noon and nighttime whatever he may do
 Granma she laughs
 Granpa he laughs
 Wife she laughs
 And I of course laugh too

 But oncea likely spell agowhen that poor little chick
 From teething or from some such ill of infancy fell sick
 You wouldnt know us people as the same that went about
 Afeelin good all over just to hear him crow and shout
 And though the doctor poohed our fears and said hed pull him through
 Old granma cried
 And granpa cried
 And wife she cried
 And Iyes I cried too

 It makes us all feel good to have a baby on the place
 With his everlastin crowing and his dimpling dumpling face
 The patter of his pinky feet makes music everywhere
 And when he shakes those fists of his goodby to every care
 No matter what our trouble is when he begins to coo
 Old granma laughs
 And granpa laughs
 Wife she laughs
 And Iyou bet I laugh too




SO SO ROCKABY SO

 So so rockaby so
 Off to the garden where dreamikins grow
 And here is a kiss on your winkyblink eyes
 And here is a kiss on your dimpledown cheek
 And here is a kiss for the treasure that lies
 In the beautiful garden way up in the skies
 Which you seek
 Now mind these three kisses wherever you go
 So so rockaby so

 Theres one little fumfay who lives there I know
 For he dances all night where the dreamikins grow
 I send him this kiss on your droopydrop eyes
 I send him this kiss on your rosyred cheek
 And here is a kiss for the dream that shall rise
 When the fumfay shall dance in those faraway skies
 Which you seek
 Be sure that you pay those three kisses you owe
 So so rockaby so

 And bylow as you rockaby go
 Dont forget mother who loveth you so
 And here is her kiss on your weepydeep eyes
 And here is her kiss on your peachypink cheek
 And here is her kiss for the dreamland that lies
 Like a babe on the breast of those faraway skies
 Which you seek
 The blinkywink garden where dreamikins grow
 So so rockaby so




THE SONG OF LUDDYDUD

 A sunbeam comes acreeping
 Into my dear ones nest
 And sings to our babe asleeping
 The song that I love the best
 T is little LuddyDud in the morning
 T is little LuddyDud at night
 And all day long
 T is the same sweet song
 Of that waddling toddling coddling little mite
 LuddyDud

 The bird to the tossing clover
 The bee to the swaying bud
 Keep singing that sweet song over
 Of wee little LuddyDud
 T is little LuddyDud in the morning
 T is little LuddyDud at night
 And all day long
 T is the same dear song
 Of that growing crowing knowing little sprite
 LuddyDud

 LuddyDuds cradle is swinging
 Where softly the night winds blow
 And LuddyDuds mother is singing
 A song that is sweet and low
 T is little LuddyDud in the morning
 T is little LuddyDud at night
 And all day long
 T is the same sweet song
 Of my nearest and my dearest hearts delight
 LuddyDud




THE DUEL

 The gingham dog and the calico cat
 Side by side on the table sat
 T was halfpast twelve and what do you think
 Nor one nor t other had slept a wink
 The old Dutch clock and the Chinese plate
 Appeared to know as sure as fate
 There was going to be a terrible spat
 I wasnt there I simply state
 What was told to me by the Chinese plate

 The gingham dog went bowwowwow
 And the calico cat replied meeow
 The air was littered an hour or so
 With bits of gingham and calico
 While the old Dutch clock in the chimney place
 Up with its hands before its face
 For it always dreaded a family row
 Now mind Im only telling you
 What the old Dutch clock declares is true

 The Chinese plate looked very blue
 And wailed Oh dear what shall we do
 But the gingham dog and the calico cat
 Wallowed this way and tumbled that
 Employing every tooth and claw
 In the awfullest way you ever saw
 And oh how the gingham and calico flew
 Dont fancy I exaggerate
 I got my news from the Chinese plate

 Next morning where the two had sat
 They found no trace of dog or cat
 And some folks think unto this day
 That burglars stole that pair away
 But the truth about the cat and pup
 Is this they ate each other up
 Now what do you really think of that
 The old Dutch clock it told me so
 And that is how I came to know




GOODCHILDREN STREET

 Theres a dear little home in GoodChildren street
 My heart turneth fondly today
 Where tinkle of tongues and patter of feet
 Make sweetest of music at play
 Where the sunshine of love illumines each face
 And warms every heart in that oldfashioned place

 For dear little children go romping about
 With dollies and tin tops and drums
 And my how they frolic and scamper and shout
 Till bedtime too speedily comes
 Oh days they are golden and days they are fleet
 With little folk living in GoodChildren street

 See here comes an army with guns painted red
 And swords caps and plumes of all sorts
 The captain rides gaily and proudly ahead
 On a stickhorse that prances and snorts
 Oh legions of soldiers youre certain to meet
 Nice makebelieve soldiersin GoodChildren street

 And yonder Odette wheels her dolly about
 Poor dolly Im sure she is ill
 For one of her blue china eyes has dropped out
 And her voice is asthmaticly shrill
 Then too I observe she is minus her feet
 Which causes much sorrow in GoodChildren street

 T is so the dear children go romping about
 With dollies and banners and drums
 And I venture to say they are sadly put out
 When an end to their jubilee comes
 Oh days they are golden and days they are fleet
 With little folk living in GoodChildren street

 But when falleth night over river and town
 Those little folk vanish from sight
 And an angel all white from the sky cometh down
 And guardeth the babes through the night
 And singeth her lullabies tender and sweet
 To the dear little people in GoodChildren Street

 Though elsewhere the world be oerburdened with care
 Though poverty fall to my lot
 Though toil and vexation be always my share
 What care Ithey trouble me not
 This thought maketh life ever joyous and Sweet
 Theres a dear little home in GoodChildren street




THE DELECTABLE BALLAD OF THE WALLER LOT

 Up yonder in Buena Park
 There is a famous spot
 In legend and in history
 Yclept the Waller Lot

 There children play in daytime
 And lovers stroll by dark
 For t is the goodliest trystingplace
 In all Buena Park

 Once on a time that beauteous maid
 Sweet little Sissy Knott
 Took out her pretty doll to walk
 Within the Waller Lot

 While thus she fared from Ravenswood
 Came Injuns oer the plain
 And seized upon that beauteous maid
 And rent her doll in twain

 Oh t was a piteous thing to hear
 Her lamentations wild
 She tore her golden curls and cried
 My child My child My child

 Alas what cared those Injun chiefs
 How bitterly wailed she
 They never had been mothers
 And they could not hope to be

 Have done with tears they rudely quoth
 And then they bound her hands
 For they proposed to take her off
 To distant border lands

 But joy from Mr Eddys barn
 Doth Willie Clow behold
 The sight that makes his hair rise up
 And all his blood run cold

 He put his fingers in his mouth
 And whistled long and clear
 And presently a goodly horde
 Of cowboys did appear

 Cried Willie Clow My comrades bold
 Haste to the Waller Lot
 And rescue from that Injun band
 Our charming Sissy Knott

 Spare neither Injun buck nor squaw
 But smite them hide and hair
 Spare neither sex nor age nor size
 And no condition spare

 Then sped that cowboy band away
 Full of revengeful wrath
 And Kendall Evans rode ahead
 Upon a hickory lath

 And next came gallant Dady Field
 And Willies brother Kent
 The Eddy boys and Robbie James
 On murderous purpose bent

 For they were much beholden to
 That maidin sooth the lot
 Were very very much in love
 With charming Sissy Knott

 What wonder She was beautys queen
 And good beyond compare
 Moreover it was known she was
 Her wealthy fathers heir

 Now when the Injuns saw that band
 They trembled with affright
 And yet they thought the cheapest thing
 To do was stay and fight

 So sturdily they stood their ground
 Nor would their prisoner yield
 Despite the wrath of Willie Clow
 And gallant Dady Field

 Oh never fiercer battle raged
 Upon the Waller Lot
 And never blood more freely flowed
 Than flowed for Sissy Knott

 An Injun chief of monstrous size
 Got Kendall Evans down
 And Robbie James was soon oerthrown
 By one of great renown

 And Dady Field was sorely done
 And Willie Clow was hurt
 And all that gallant cowboy band
 Lay wallowing in the dirt

 But still they strove with might and main
 Till all the Waller Lot
 Was strewn with hair and gouts of gore
 All all for Sissy Knott

 Then cried the maiden in despair
 Alas I sadly fear
 The battle and my hopes are lost
 Unless some help appear

 Lo as she spoke she saw afar
 The rescuer looming up
 The pride of all Buena Park
 Clows famous yellow pup

 Now sickem Don the maiden cried
 Now sickem Don cried she
 Obedient Don at once complied
 As ordered so did he

 He sickedem all so passing well
 That overcome by fright
 The Indian horde gave up the fray
 And safety sought in flight

 They ran and ran and ran and ran
 Oer valley plain and hill
 And if they are not walking now
 Why then theyre running still

 The cowboys rose up from the dust
 With faces black and blue
 Remember beauteous maid said they
 Weve bled and died for you

 And though we suffer grievously
 We gladly hail the lot
 That brings us toils and pains and wounds
 For charming Sissy Knott

 But Sissy Knott still wailed and wept
 And still her fate reviled
 For who could patch her dolly up
 Who who could mend her child

 Then out her doting mother came
 And soothed her daughter then
 Grieve not my darling I will sew
 Your dolly up again

 Joy soon succeeded unto grief
 And tears were soon dried up
 And dignities were heaped upon
 Clows noble yellow pup

 Him all that goodly company
 Did as deliverer hail
 They tied a ribbon round his neck
 Another round his tail

 And every anniversary day
 Upon the Waller Lot
 They celebrate the victory won
 For charming Sissy Knott

 And I the poet of these folk
 Am ordered to compile
 This truly famous history
 In good old ballad style

 Which having done as to have earned
 The sweet rewards of fame
 In what same style I did begin
 I now shall end the same

 So let us sing Long live the King
 Long live the Queen and Jack
 Long live the tenspot and the ace
 And also all the pack




THE STORK

 Last night the Stork came stalking
 And Stork beneath your wing
 Lay lapped in dreamless slumber
 The tiniest little thing
 From Babyland out yonder
 Beside a silver sea
 You brought a priceless treasure
 As gift to mine and me

 Last night my dear one listened
 And wife you knew the cry
 The dear old Stork has sought our home
 A many times gone by
 And in your gentle bosom
 I found the pretty thing
 That from the realm out yonder
 Our friend the Stork did bring

 Last night a babe awakened
 And babe how strange and new
 Must seem the home and people
 The Stork has brought you to
 And yet methinks you like them
 You neither stare nor weep
 But closer to my dear one
 You cuddle and you sleep

 Last night my heart grew fonder
 O happy heart of mine
 Sing of the inspirations
 That round my pathway shine
 And sing your sweetest lovesong
 To this dear nestling wee
 The Stork from WayOutYonder
 Hath brought to mine and me




THE BOTTLE TREE

 A bottle tree bloometh in Winkyway land
 Heighho for a bottle I say
 A snug little berth in that ship I demand
 That rocketh the BottleTree babies away
 Where the Bottle Tree bloometh by night and by day
 And reacheth its fruit to each wee dimpled hand
 You take of that fruit as much as you list
 For colics a nuisance that doesnt exist
 So cuddle me and cuddle me fast
 And cuddle me snug in my cradle away
 For I hunger and thirst for that precious repast
 Heighho for a bottle I say

 The Bottle Tree bloometh by night and by day
 Heighho for Winkyway land
 And BottleTree fruit as Ive heard people say
 Makes bellies of BottleTree babies expand
 And that is a trick I would fain understand
 Heighho for a bottle today
 And heighho for a bottle tonight
 A bottle of milk that is creamy and white
 So cuddle me close and cuddle me fast
 And cuddle me snug in my cradle away
 For I hunger and thirst for that precious repast
 Heighho for a bottle I say




GOOGLYGOO

 Of mornings bright and early
 When the lark is on the wing
 And the robin in the maple
 Hops from her nest to sing
 From yonder cheery chamber
 Cometh a mellow coo
 T is the sweet persuasive treble
 Of my little GooglyGoo

 The sunbeams hear his music
 And they seek his little bed
 And they dance their prettiest dances
 Round his golden curly head
 Schottisches galops minuets
 Gavottes and waltzes too
 Dance they unto the music
 Of my googling GooglyGoo

 My heartmy heart it leapeth
 To hear that treble tone
 What music like thy music
 My darling and mine own
 And patientlyyes cheerfully
 I toil the long day through
 My labor seemeth lightened
 By the song of GooglyGoo

 I may not see his antics
 Nor kiss his dimpled cheek
 I may not smooth the tresses
 The sunbeams love to seek
 It mattereth notthe echo
 Of his sweet persuasive coo
 Recurreth to remind me
 Of my little GooglyGoo

 And when I come at evening
 I stand without the door
 And patiently I listen
 For that dear sound once more
 And oftentimes I wonder
 Oh God what should I do
 If any ill should happen
 To my little GooglyGoo

 Then in affright I call him
 I hear his gleeful shouts
 Begone ye dread forebodings
 Begone ye killing doubts
 For with my arms about him
 My heart warms through and through
 With the oogling and the googling
 Of my little GooglyGoo




THE BENCHLEGGED FYCE

 Speakin of dorgs my benchlegged fyce
 Hed most o the virtues an nary a vice
 Some folks called him Sooner a name that arose
 From his predisposition to chronic repose
 But rouse his ambition he couldnt be beat
 Yer bet yer he got thar on all his four feet

 Mos dorgs hez some fortelike huntin an such
 But the sports o the field didnt bother him much
 Wuz just a plain dorg an contented to be
 On peaceable terms with the neighbors an me
 Used to fiddle an squirm and grunt Oh how nice
 When I tickled the back of that benchlegged fyce

 He wuz long in the barl like a fyce oughter be
 His color wuz yaller as ever you see
 His tail curlin upward wuz long loose an slim
 When he didnt wag it why the tail it wagged him
 His legs wuz so crooked my benchlegged pup
 Wuz as tall settin down as he wuz standin up

 Hed lie by the stove of a night an regret
 The various vittles an things he had et
 When a stranger most likely a tramp come along
 Hed lift up his voice in significant song
 You wondered by gum how there ever wuz space
 In that bosom o hisn to hold so much bass

 Of daytimes hed sneak to the road an lie down
 An tackle the country dorgs comin to town
 By common consent he wuz boss in St Joe
 For what he took hold of he never let go
 An a dude that come courtin our girl left a slice
 Of his white flannel suit with our benchlegged fyce

 He wuz good to us kidswhen we pulled at his fur
 Or twisted his tail he would never demur
 He seemed to enjoy all our play an our chaff
 For his tongue ud hang out an hed laff an hed laff
 An once when the Hobart boy fell through the ice
 He wuz drug clean ashore by that benchlegged fyce

 We all hev our choice an you like the rest
 Allow that the dorg which youve got is the best
 I wouldnt give much for the boy at grows up
 With no friendship subsistin tween him an a pup
 When a fellow gits oldI tell you its nice
 To think of his youth and his benchlegged fyce

 To think of the springtime way back in St Joe
 Of the peachtrees abloom an the daisies ablow
 To think of the play in the medder an grove
 When little legs wrassled an little hans strove
 To think of the loyalty valor an truth
 Of the friendships that hallow the season of youth




LITTLE MISS BRAG

 Little Miss Brag has much to say
 To the rich little lady from over the way
 And the rich little lady puts out a lip
 As she looks at her own white dainty slip
 And wishes that she could wear a gown
 As pretty as gingham of faded brown
 For little Miss Brag she lays much stress
 On the privileges of a gingham dress
 Aha
 Oho

 The rich little lady from over the way
 Has beautiful dolls in vast array
 Yet she envies the raggedy homemade doll
 She hears our little Miss Brag extol
 For the raggedy doll can fear no hurt
 From wet or heat or tumble or dirt
 Her nose is inked and her mouth is too
 And one eyes black and the others blue
 Aha
 Oho

 The rich little lady goes out to ride
 With footmen standing up outside
 Yet wishes that sometimes after dark
 Her father would trundle her in the park
 That sometimes her mother would sing the things
 Little Miss Brag says her mother sings
 When through the attic window streams
 The moonlight full of golden dreams
 Aha
 Oho

 Yes little Miss Brag has much to say
 To the rich little lady from over the way
 And yet who knows but from her heart
 Often the bitter sighs upstart
 Uprise to lose their burn and sting
 In the grace of the tongue that loves to sing
 Praise of the treasures all its own
 So Ive come to love that treble tone
 Aha
 Oho




THE HUMMING TOP

 The top it hummeth a sweet sweet song
 To my dear little boy at play
 Merrily singeth all day long
 As it spinneth and spinneth away
 And my dear little boy
 He laugheth with joy
 When he heareth the monotone
 Of that busy thing
 That loveth to sing
 The song that is all its own

 Hold fast the string and wind it tight
 That the song be loud and clear
 Now hurl the top with all your might
 Upon the banquette here
 And straight from the string
 The joyous thing
 Boundeth and spinneth along
 And it whirrs and it chirrs
 And it birrs and it purrs
 Ever its pretty song

 Will ever my dear little boy grow old
 As some have grown before
 Will ever his heart feel faint and cold
 When he heareth the songs of yore
 Will ever this toy
 Of my dear little boy
 When the years have worn away
 Sing sad and low
 Of the long ago
 As it singeth to me today




LADY BUTTONEYES

 When the busy day is done
 And my weary little one
 Rocketh gently to and fro
 When the night winds softly blow
 And the crickets in the glen
 Chirp and chirp and chirp again
 When upon the haunted green
 Fairies dance around their queen
 Then from yonder misty skies
 Cometh Lady ButtonEyes

 Through the murk and mist and gloam
 To our quiet cozy home
 Where to singing sweet and low
 Rocks a cradle to and fro
 Where the clocks dull monotone
 Telleth of the day thats done
 Where the moonbeams hover oer
 Playthings sleeping on the floor
 Where my weary wee one lies
 Cometh Lady ButtonEyes

 Cometh like a fleeting ghost
 From some distant eerie coast
 Never footfall can you hear
 As that spirit fareth near
 Never whisper never word
 From that shadowqueen is heard
 In ethereal raiment dight
 From the realm of fay and sprite
 In the depth of yonder skies
 Cometh Lady ButtonEyes

 Layeth she her hands upon
 My dear weary little one
 And those white hands overspread
 Like a veil the curly head
 Seem to fondle and caress
 Every little silken tress
 Then she smooths the eyelids down
 Over those two eyes of brown
 In such soothing tender wise
 Cometh Lady ButtonEyes

 Dearest feel upon your brow
 That caressing magic now
 For the crickets in the glen
 Chirp and chirp and chirp again
 While upon the haunted green
 Fairies dance around their queen
 And the moonbeams hover oer
 Playthings sleeping on the floor
 Hush my sweet from yonder skies
 Cometh Lady ButtonEyes




THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE

 Play that my knee was a calico mare
 Saddled and bridled for Bumpville
 Leap to the back of this steed if you dare
 And gallop away to Bumpville
 I hope youll be sure to sit fast in your seat
 For this calico mare is prodigiously fleet
 And many adventures youre likely to meet
 As you journey along to Bumpville

 This calico mare both gallops and trots
 While whisking you off to Bumpville
 She paces she shies and she stumbles in spots
 In the tortuous road to Bumpville
 And sometimes this strangely mercurial steed
 Will suddenly stop and refuse to proceed
 Which all will admit is vexatious indeed
 When one is en route to Bumpville

 Shes scared of the cars when the engine goes Toot
 Down by the crossing at Bumpville
 Youd better look out for that treacherous brute
 Bearing you off to Bumpville
 With a snort she rears up on her hindermost heels
 And executes jigs and Virginia reels
 Words fail to explain how embarrassed one feels
 Dancing so wildly to Bumpville

 Its bumpytybump and its jiggytyjog
 Journeying on to Bumpville
 Its over the hilltop and down through the bog
 You ride on your way to Bumpville
 Its rattletybang over boulder and stump
 There are rivers to ford there are fences to jump
 And the corduroy road it goes bumpytybump
 Mile after mile to bumpville

 Perhaps youll observe its no easy thing
 Making the journey to Bumpville
 So I think on the whole it were prudent to bring
 An end to this ride to Bumpville
 For though she has uttered no protest or plaint
 The calico mare must be blowing and faint
 Whats more to the point Im blowed if I aint
 So play we have got to Bumpville




THE BROOK

 I looked in the brook and saw a face
 Heighho but a child was I
 There were rushes and willows in that place
 And they clutched at the brook as the brook ran by
 And the brook it ran its own sweet way
 As a child doth run in heedless play
 And as it ran I heard it say
 Hasten with me
 To the roistering sea
 That is wroth with the flame of the morning sky

 I look in the brook and see a face
 Heighho but the years go by
 The rushes are dead in the oldtime place
 And the willows I knew when a child was I
 And the brook it seemeth to me to say
 As ever it stealeth on its way
 Solemnly now and not in play
 Oh come with me
 To the slumbrous sea
 That is gray with the peace of the evening sky

 Heighho but the years go by
 I would to God that a child were I




PICNICTIME

 Its June agin an in my soul I feel the fillin joy
 Thats sure to come this time o year to every little boy
 For every June the Sundayschools at picnics may be seen
 Where fields beyont the swellin floods stand dressed in livin green
 Where little girls are skeered to death with spiders bugs and ants
 An little boys get grassstains on their goto meetin pants
 Its June agin an with it all what happiness is mine
 Theres goin to be a picnic an Im goin to jine

 One year I jined the Baptists an goodness how it rained
 But grampa says that thats the way baptizo is explained
 And once I jined the Piscopils an had a heap o fun
 But the boss of all the picnics was the Presbyteriun
 They had so many puddins sallids sandwidges an pies
 That a feller wisht his stummick was as hungry as his eyes
 Oh yes the eatin Presbyteriuns give yer is so fine
 That when they have a picnic you bet Im goin to jine

 But at this time the Methodists have special claims on me
 For theyre goin to give a picnic on the 21st D V
 Why should a liberal universalist like me object
 To share the joys of fellowship with every friendly sect
 However hetrodox their articles of faith elsewise may be
 Their doctrine of fried chickn is a savin grace to me
 So on the 21st of June the weather bein fine
 Theyre goin to give a picnic and Im goin to jine




SHUFFLESHOON AND AMBERLOCKS

 Shuffleshoon and AmberLocks
 Sit together building blocks
 ShuffleShoon is old and gray
 AmberLocks a little child
 But together at their play
 Age and Youth are reconciled
 And with sympathetic glee
 Build their castles fair to see

 When I grow to be a man
 So the wee ones prattle ran
 I shall build a castle so
 With a gateway broad and grand
 Here a pretty vine shall grow
 There a soldier guard shall stand
 And the tower shall be so high
 Folks will wonder by and by

 ShuffleShoon quoth Yes I know
 Thus I builded long ago
 Here a gate and there a wall
 Here a window there a door
 Here a steeple wondrous tall
 Riseth ever more and more
 But the years have leveled low
 What I builded long ago

 So they gossip at their play
 Heedless of the fleeting day
 One speaks of the Long Ago
 Where his dead hopes buried lie
 One with chubby cheeks aglow
 Prattleth of the By and By
 Side by side they build their blocks
 ShuffleShoon and AmberLocks




THE SHUTEYE TRAIN

 Come my little one with me
 There are wondrous sights to see
 As the evening shadows fall
 In your pretty cap and gown
 Dont detain
 The ShutEye train
 Tingaling the bell it goeth
 Toottoot the whistle bloweth
 And we hear the warning call
 All aboard for ShutEye Town

 Over hill and over plain
 Soon will speed the ShutEye train
 Through the blue where bloom the stars
 And the Mother Moon looks down
 Well away
 To land of Fay
 Oh the sights that we shall see there
 Come my little one with me there
 T is a goodly train of cars
 All aboard for ShutEye Town

 Swifter than a wild birds flight
 Through the realms of fleecy light
 We shall speed and speed away
 Let the Night in envy frown
 What care we
 How wroth she be
 To the Balowland above us
 To the Balowfolk who love us
 Let us hasten while we may
 All aboard for ShutEye Town

 ShutEye Town is passing fair
 Golden dreams await us there
 We shall dream those dreams my dear
 Till the Mother Moon goes down
 See unfold
 Delights untold
 And in those mysterious places
 We shall see beloved faces
 And beloved voices hear
 In the grace of ShutEye Town

 Heavy are your eyes my sweet
 Weary are your little feet
 Nestle closer up to me
 In your pretty cap and gown
 Dont detain
 The ShutEye train
 Tingaling the bell it goeth
 Toottoot the whistle bloweth
 Oh the sights that we shall see
 All aboard for ShutEye Town




LITTLEOH DEAR

 See what a wonderful garden is here
 Planted and trimmed for my LittleOhDear
 Posies so gaudy and grass of such brown
 Search ye the country and hunt ye the town
 And never yell meet with a garden so queer
 As this one Ive made for my LittleOhDear

 Marigolds white and buttercups blue
 Lilies all dabbled with honey and dew
 The cactus that trails over trellis and wall
 Roses and pansies and violetsall
 Make proper obeisance and reverent cheer
 When into her garden steps LittleOhDear

 And up at the top of that lavendertree
 A silverbird singeth as only can she
 For ever and only she singeth the song
 I love youI love you the happy day long
 Then the echothe echo that smiteth me here
 I love you I love you my LittleOhDear

 The garden may wither the silverbird fly
 But what careth my little precious or I
 From her pathway of flowers that in spring time upstart
 She walketh the tenderer way in my heart
 And oh it is always the summertime here
 With that song of I love you my LittleOhDear




THE FLYAWAY HORSE

 Oh a wonderful horse is the FlyAway Horse
 Perhaps you have seen him before
 Perhaps while you slept his shadow has swept
 Through the moonlight that floats on the floor
 For its only at night when the stars twinkle bright
 That the FlyAway Horse with a neigh
 And a pull at his rein and a toss of his mane
 Is up on his heels and away
 The Moon in the sky
 As he gallopeth by
 Cries Oh what a marvelous sight
 And the Stars in dismay
 Hide their faces away
 In the lap of old Grandmother Night

 It is yonder out yonder the FlyAway Horse
 Speedeth ever and ever away
 Over meadows and lanes over mountains and plains
 Over streamlets that sing at their play
 And over the sea like a ghost sweepeth he
 While the ships they go sailing below
 And he speedeth so fast that the men at the mast
 Adjudge him some portent of woe
 What ho there they cry
 As he flourishes by
 With a whisk of his beautiful tail
 And the fish in the sea
 Are as scared as can be
 From the nautilus up to the whale

 And the FlyAway Horse seeks those faraway lands
 You little folk dream of at night
 Where candytrees grow and honeybrooks flow
 And cornfields with popcorn are white
 And the beasts in the wood are ever so good
 To children who visit them there
 What glory astride of a lion to ride
 Or to wrestle around with a bear
 The monkeys they say
 Come on let us play
 And they frisk in the cocoanuttrees
 While the parrots that cling
 To the peanutvines sing
 Or converse with comparative ease

 Off scamper to bedyou shall ride him tonight
 For as soon as youve fallen asleep
 With a jubilant neigh he shall bear you away
 Over forest and hillside and deep
 But tell us my dear all you see and you hear
 In those beautiful lands over there
 Where the FlyAway Horse wings his faraway course
 With the wee one consigned to his care
 Then grandma will cry
 In amazement Oh my
 And shell think it could never be so
 And only we two
 Shall know it is true
 You and I little precious shall know




SWING HIGH AND SWING LOW

 Swing high and swing low
 While the breezes they blow
 Its off for a sailor thy father would go
 And its here in the harbor in sight of the sea
 He hath left his wee babe with my song and with me
 Swing high and swing low
 While the breezes they blow

 Swing high and swing low
 While the breezes they blow
 Its oh for the waiting as weary days go
 And its oh for the heartache that smiteth me when
 I sing my song over and over again
 Swing high and swing low
 While the breezes they blow

 Swing high and swing low 
 The sea singeth so
 And it waileth anon in its ebb and its flow
 And a sleeper sleeps on to that song of the sea
 Nor recketh he ever of mine or of me
 Swing high and swing low
 While the breezes they blow
 T was off for a sailor thy father would go




WHEN I WAS A BOY

 Up in the attic where I slept
 When I was a boy a little boy
 In through the lattice the moonlight crept
 Bringing a tide of dreams that swept
 Over the low red trundlebed
 Bathing the tangled curly head
 While moonbeams played at hideandseek
 With the dimples on the sunbrowned cheek
 When I was a boy a little boy

 And oh the dreamsthe dreams I dreamed
 When I was a boy a little boy
 For the grace that through the lattice streamed
 Over my folded eyelids seemed
 To have the gift of prophecy
 And to bring me glimpses of times to be
 When manhoods clarion seemed to call
 Ah that was the sweetest dream of all
 When I was a boy a little boy

 Id like to sleep where I used to sleep
 When I was a boy a little boy
 For in at the lattice the moon would peep
 Bringing her tide of dreams to sweep
 The crosses and griefs of the years away
 From the heart that is weary and faint today
 And those dreams should give me back again
 A peace I have never known since then
 When I was a boy a little boy




AT PLAY

 Play that you are mother dear
 And play that papa is your beau
 Play that we sit in the corner here
 Just as we used to long ago
 Playing so we lovers two
 Are just as happy as we can be
 And Ill say I love you to you
 And you say I love you to me
 I love you we both shall say
 All in earnest and all in play

 Or play that you are that other one
 That some time came and went away
 And play that the light of years agone
 Stole into my heart again today
 Playing that you are the one I knew
 In the days that never again may be
 Ill say I love you to you
 And you say I love you to me
 I love you my heart shall say
 To the ghost of the past come back today

 Or play that you sought this nestlingplace
 For your own sweet self with that dual guise
 Of your pretty mother in your face
 And the look of that other in your eyes
 So the dear old loves shall live anew
 As I hold my darling on my knee
 And Ill say I love you to you
 And you say I love you to me
 Oh many a strange true thing we say
 And do when we pretend to play




A VALENTINE

 Go Cupid and my sweetheart tell
 I love her well
 Yes though she tramples on my heart
 And rends that bleeding thing apart
 And though she rolls a scornful eye
 On doting me when I go by
 And though she scouts at everything
 As tribute unto her I bring
 Apple banana caramel
 Haste Cupid to my love and tell
 In spite of all I love her well

 And further say I have a sled
 Cushioned in blue and painted red
 The groceryman has promised I
 Can hitch whenever he goes by
 Go tell her that and furthermore
 Apprise my sweetheart that a score
 Of other little girls implore
 The boon of riding on that sled
 Painted and hitched as aforesaid
 And tell her Cupid only she
 Shall ride upon that sled with me
 Tell her this all and further tell
 I love her well




LITTLE ALLALONEY

 Little AllAloneys feet
 Pitterpatter in the hall
 And his mother runs to meet
 And to kiss her toddling sweet
 Ere perchance he fall
 He is oh so weak and small
 Yet what danger shall he fear
 When his mother hovereth near
 And he hears her cheering call
 AllAloney

 Little AllAloneys face
 It is all aglow with glee
 As around that rompingplace
 At a terrifying pace
 Lungeth plungeth he
 And that hero seems to be
 All unconscious of our cheers
 Only one dear voice he hears
 Calling reassuringly
 AllAloney

 Though his legs bend with their load
 Though his feet they seem so small
 That you cannot help forebode
 Some disastrous episode
 In that noisy hall
 Neither threatening bump nor fall
 Little AllAloney fears
 But with sweet bravado steers
 Whither comes that cheery call
 AllAloney

 Ah that in the years to come
 When he shares of Sorrows store
 When his feet are chill and numb
 When his cross is burdensome
 And his heart is sore
 Would that he could hear once more
 The gentle voice he used to hear
 Divine with mother love and cheer
 Calling from yonder spirit shore
 All all alone




SEEIN THINGS

 I aint afeard uv snakes or toads or bugs or worms or mice
 An things at girls are skeered uv I think are awful nice
 Im pretty brave I guess an yet I hate to go to bed
 For when Im tucked up warm an snug an when my prayers are said
 Mother tells me Happy dreams and takes away the light
 An leaves me lyin all alone an seein things at night

 Sometimes theyre in the corner sometimes theyre by the door
 Sometimes theyre all astandin in the middle uv the floor
 Sometimes they are asittin down sometimes theyre walkin round
 So softly an so creepylike they never make a sound
 Sometimes they are as black as ink an other times theyre white
 But the color aint no difference when you see things at night

 Once when I licked a feller at had just moved on our street
 An father sent me up to bed without a bite to eat
 I woke up in the dark an saw things standin in a row
 Alookin at me crosseyed an pintin at meso
 Oh my I wuz so skeered that time I never slep a mite
 Its almost alluz when Im bad I see things at night

 Lucky thing I aint a girl or Id be skeered to death
 Bein Im a boy I duck my head an hold my breath
 An I am oh so sorry Im a naughty boy an then
 I promise to be better an I say my prayers again
 Granma tells me thats the only way to make it right
 When a feller has been wicked an sees things at night
 An so when other naughty boys would coax me into sin
 I try to skwush the Tempters voice at urges me within
 An when theys pie for supper or cakes at s big an nice
 I want tobut I do not pass my plate fr them things twice
 No ruther let Starvation wipe me slowly out o sight
 Than I should keep alivin on an seein things at night




THE CUNNIN LITTLE THING

 When baby wakes of mornings
 Then its wake ye people all
 For another day
 Of song and play
 Has come at our darlings call
 And till she gets her dinner
 She makes the welkin ring
 And she wont keep still till shes had her fill
 The cunnin little thing

 When baby goes awalking
 Oh how her paddies fly
 For thats the way
 The babies say
 To other folk byby
 The trees bend down to kiss her
 And the birds in rapture sing
 As there she stands and waves her hands
 The cunnin little thing

 When baby goes arocking
 In her bed at close of day
 At hideandseek
 On her dainty cheek
 The dreams and the dimples play
 Then its sleep in the tender kisses
 The guardian angels bring
 From the Far Above to my sweetest love
 You cunnin little thing




THE DOLLS WOOING

 The little French doll was a dear little doll
 Tricked out in the sweetest of dresses
 Her eyes were of hue
 A most delicate blue
 And dark as the night were her tresses
 Her dear little mouth was fluted and red
 And this little French doll was so very well bred
 That whenever accosted her little mouth said
 Mamma mamma

 The stockinet doll with one arm and one leg
 Had once been a handsome young fellow
 But now he appeared
 Rather frowzy and bleared
 In his torn regimentals of yellow
 Yet his heart gave a curious thump as he lay
 In the little toy cart near the window one day
 And heard the sweet voice of that French dolly say
 Mamma mamma

 He listened so long and he listened so hard
 That anon he grew ever so tender
 For its everywhere known
 That the feminine tone
 Gets away with all masculine gender
 He up and he wooed her with soldierly zest
 But all shed reply to the love he professed
 Were these plaintive words which perhaps you have guessed
 Mamma mamma

 Her mothera sweet little lady of five
 Vouchsafed her parental protection
 And although stockinet
 Wasnt blueblooded yet
 She really could make no objection
 So soldier and dolly were wedded one day
 And a moment ago as I journeyed that way
 Im sure that I heard a wee baby voice say
 Mamma mamma




INSCRIPTION FOR MY LITTLE SONS SILVER PLATE

 When thou dost eat from off this plate
 I charge thee be thou temperate
 Unto thine elders at the board
 Do thou sweet reverence accord
 And though to dignity inclined
 Unto the servingfolk be kind
 Be ever mindful of the poor
 Nor turn them hungry from the door
 And unto God for health and food
 And all that in thy life is good
 Give thou thy heart in gratitude




FISHERMAN JIMS KIDS

 Fisherman Jim lived on the hill
 With his bonnie wife an his little boys
 T wuz Blow ye winds as blow ye will
 Naught we reck of your cold and noise
 For happy and warm were he an his
 And he dandled his kids upon his knee
 To the song of the sea

 Fisherman Jim would sail all day
 But when come night upon the sands
 His little kids ran from their play
 Callin to him an wavin their hands
 Though the wind was fresh and the sea was high
 Hed hearemyou betabove the roar
 Of the waves on the shore

 Once Fisherman Jim sailed into the bay
 As the sun went down in a cloudy sky
 And never a kid saw he at play
 And he listened in vain for the welcoming cry
 In his little house he learned it all
 And he clinched his hands and he bowed his head
 The fever they said

 T wuz a pitiful time for Fisherman Jim
 With them darlins adyin afore his eyes
 Astretchin their wee hands out to him
 An abreakin his heart with the oldtime cries
 He had heerd so often upon the sands
 For they thought they wuz helpin his boat ashore
 Till they spoke no more

 But Fisherman Jim lived on and on
 Castin his nets an sailin the sea
 As a man will live when his heart is gone
 Fisherman Jim lived hopelessly
 Till once in those years they come an said
 Old Fisherman Jim is powerful sick
 Go to him quick

 Then Fisherman Jim says he to me
 Its a long long cruiseyou understand
 But over beyont the ragin sea
 I kin see my boys on the shinin sand
 Waitin to help this ol hulk ashore
 Just as they used toah mate you know
 In the long ago

 No sir he wuznt afeard to die
 For all night long he seemed to see
 His little boys of the days gone by
 An to hear sweet voices forgot by me
 An just as the mornin sun come up
 Theyre holdin me by the hands he cried
 An so he died




FIDDLEDEEDEE

 There once was a bird that lived up in a tree
 And all he could whistle was Fiddledeedee
 A very provoking unmusical song
 For one to be whistling the summer day long
 Yet always contented and busy was he
 With that vocal recurrence of Fiddledeedee

 Hard by lived a brave little soldier of four
 That weird iteration repented him sore
 I prithee DearMotherMine fetch me my gun
 For by our St Didy the deed must be done
 That shall presently rid all creation and me
 Of that ominous bird and his Fiddledeedee

 Then out came DearMotherMine bringing her son
 His awfully truculent little red gun
 The stock was of pine and the barrel of tin
 The bang it came out where the bullet went in
 The right kind of weapon I think youll agree
 For slaying all fowl that go Fiddledeedee

 The brave little soldier quoth never a word
 But he up and he drew a straight bead on that bird
 And while that vain creature provokingly sang
 The gun it went off with a terrible bang
 Then loud laughed the youthBy my Bottle cried he
 Ive put a quietus on Fiddledeedee

 Out came then DearMotherMine saying My son
 Right well have you wrought with your little red gun
 Hereafter no evil at all need I fear
 With such a brave soldier as YouMyLove here
 She kissed the dear boy
 The bird in the tree
 Continued to whistle his Fiddledeedee




OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY

 Over the hills and far away
 A little boy steals from his morning play
 And under the blossoming appletree
 He lies and he dreams of the things to be
 Of battles fought and of victories won
 Of wrongs oerthrown and of great deeds done
 Of the valor that he shall prove some day
 Over the hills and far away
 Over the hills and far away

 Over the hills and far away
 Its oh for the toil the livelong day
 But it mattereth not to the soul aflame
 With a love for riches and power and fame
 On O man while the sun is high
 On to the certain joys that lie
 Yonder where blazeth the noon of day
 Over the hills and far away
 Over the hills and far away

 Over the hills and far away
 An old man lingers at close of day
 Now that his journey is almost done
 His battles fought and his victories won
 The oldtime honesty and truth
 The trustfulness and the friends of youth
 Home and motherwhere are they
 Over the hills and far away
 Over the years and far away

array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS
