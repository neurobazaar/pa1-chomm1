Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000
If they reach just 12 of the worlds population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by years end

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only about 4 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium

JOHN CAMDEN HOTTEN Piccadilly W Jan 30 1865

51 ARRIVAL IN LONDON

MR PUNCH My dear SirYou probly didnt meet my uncle Wilyim
when he was on these shores I jedge so from the fack that his
pursoots wasnt litrary Commerce which it has been trooly
observed by a statesman or somebody is the foundation stone
onto which a nations greatness rests glorious Commerce was
Uncle Wilyims fort He sold soap It smelt pretty and redily
commanded two pents a cake Im the only litrary man in our
famly It is troo I once had a dear cuzzun who wrote 22 verses
onto A Child who nearly Died of the Measles O but as he
injoodiciously introjudiced a chorious at the end of each stansy
the parrents didnt like it at all The father in particler wept
afresh assaulted my cuzzun and said he never felt so ridicklus
in his intire life The onhappy result was that my cuzzun
abandined poetry forever and went back to shoemakin a shattered
man

My Uncle Wilyim disposed of his soap and returned to his nativ
land with a very exolted opinyon of the British public It is a
edycated community said he theyre a intellectooal peple In
one small village alone I sold 50 cakes of soap incloodin
barronial halls where they offered me a ducal coronet but I
said nogive it to the poor This was the way Uncle Wilyim
went on He told us however some stories that was rather too
much to be easily swallerd In fack my Uncle Wilyim was not a
emblem of trooth He retired some years ago on a hansum
comptency derived from the insurancemoney he received on a
rather shaky skooner he owned and which turned up while lyin at
a wharf one night the cargo havin fortnitly been removed the day
afore the disastriss calamty occurd Uncle Wilyim said it was
one of the most singler things he ever heard of and after
collectin the insurance money he bust into a flood of tears and
retired to his farm in Pennsylvany He was my uncle by marriage
only I do not say that he wasnt a honest man I simply say
that if you have a uncle and bitter experunce tells you it is
more profitable in a pecoonery pint of view to put pewter spoons
instid of silver ones onto the table when that uncle dines with
you in a frenly wayI simply say there is sumthun wrong in our
social sistim which calls loudly for reform

I rived on these shores at Liverpool and proceeded at once to
London I stopt at the Washington Hotel in Liverpool because it
was named after a countryman of mine who didnt get his living by
makin mistakes and whose memry is dear to civilized peple all
over the world because he was gentle and good as well as trooly
great We read in Histry of any number of great individooals
but how few of em alars should we want to take home to supper
with us Among others I would call your attention to Alexander
the Great who conkerd the world and wept because he couldnt do
it sum more and then took to ginandseltzer gettin tight
every day afore dinner with the most disgustin reglarity
causin his parunts to regret they hadnt prenticed him in his
early youth to a biskitbaker or some other occupation of a
peaceful and quiet character I say therefore to the great men
now livin you could put em all into Hyde Park by the way and
still leave room for a large and respectable concourse of
riotersbe good I say to that gifted but baldheded Prooshun
Bismarck be good and gentle in your hour of triump _I_ always
am I admit that our lines is different Bismarcks and mine
but the same glorus principle is involved I am a exhibiter of
startlin curiositys wax works snaix etsetry either of
whom as a American statesman whose name I aint at liberty to
mention for perlitical resins as he expecks to be a candidate
for a promnent offiss and hence doesnt wish to excite the rage
and jelisy of other showmeneither of whom is wuth dubble the
price of admission I say I am an exhibiter of startlin
curiositys and I also have my hours of triump but I try to be
good in em If you say Ah yes but also your hours of grief
and misfortin I answer it is troo and you probly refer to
the circumstans of my hirin a young man of dissypated habits to
fix hisself up as A real Cannibal from New Zeelan and when I was
simply tellin the audience that he was the most feroshos Cannibal
of his tribe and that alone and unassisted he had et sevril
of our fellow countrymen and that he had at one time even
contemplated eatin his Uncle Thomas on his mothers side as well
as other near and dear relativeswhen I was makin these simple
statements the misble young man said I was a lyer and knockt me
off the platform Not quite satisfied with this he cum and trod
hevly on me and as he was a very muscular person and wore
remarkable thick boots I knew at once that a canary bird wasnt
walkin over me

I admit that my ambition overlept herself in this instuns and
Ive been very careful ever since to deal square with the public
If I was the public I should insist on squareness tho I
shouldnt do as a portion of my audience did on the occasion jest
mentioned which they was employed in sum naberin coal mines

As you haint got no more Cannybals to show us old man said
one of em who seemed to be a kind of leader among ema tall
disgreeble skoundrilas you seem to be out of Cannybals well
sorter look round here and fix things Them wax figgers of yours
want washin Theres Napoleon Bonyparte and Julius Caesarthey
must have a bath with which coarse and brutal remark he
imitated the shrill warhoop of the western savige and assisted
by his infamus coalheavin companyins he threw all my waxwork
into the river and let my wild bears loose to pray on a peaceful
and inoffensive agricultooral community

Leavin Liverpool Im goin back there thoI want to see the
Docks which I heard spoken of at least once while I was there I
cum to London in a 1st class car passin the time very agreeable
in discussin with a countryman of mine the celebrated
SchleswigHolstein question We took that intresting question
up and carefully traced it from the time it commenced being so
down to the present day when my countryman at the close of a
four hours annymated debate said he didnt know anything about
it himself and he wanted to know if I did I told him that I
did not Hes at Ramsgate now and I am to write him when I feel
like givin him two days in which to discuss the question of negro
slavery in America But now I do not feel like it

London at last and Im stoppin at the Greenlion tavern I like
the lanlord very much indeed He had fallen into a few triflin
errers in regard to Americahe was under the impression for
instance that we et hay over there and had horns growin out of
the back part of our headsbut his chops and beer is ekal to any
I ever pertook You must cum and see me and bring the boys Im
told that Garrick used to cum here but Im growin skeptycal
about Garricks favorit taverns Ive had over 500 publichouses
pinted out to me where Garrick went I was indooced one night
by a seleck compny of Britons to visit sum 25 publichouses
and they confidentially told me that Garrick used to go to each
one of em Also Dr Johnson This wont do you know

May be Ive rambled a bit in this communycation Ill try and be
more collected in my next and meanwhile blieve me

 Trooly Yours
 Artemus Ward

52 PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS

Youll be glad to learn that Ive made a good impression onto the
mind of the lanlord of the Green Lion tavern He made a speech
about me last night Risin in the bar he spoke as follers
there bein over 20 individooals present

This North American has been a inmate of my ouse over two
weeks yit he hasnt made no attempt to scalp any member of my
famly He hasnt broke no cups or sassers or furnitur of any
kind Hear hear I find I can trust him with lited
candles He eats his wittles with a knife and a fork People of
this kind should be encurridged I purpose is elth Loud
plaws

What could I do but modestly get up and express a fervint hope
that the Atlantic Cable would bind the two countries still more
closely together The lanlord said my speech was full of
orignality but his idee was the old stage coach was more safer
and he thot peple would indors that opinyin in doo time

Im gettin on exceedin well in London I see now however
that I made a mistake in orderin my close afore I left home
The trooth is the taler in our little villige owed me for a pig
and I didnt see any other way of gettin my pay Ten years ago
these close would no doubt have been fashnble and perhaps they
would be ekally simlar ten years hens But now theyre
diffrently The taler said he knowd they was all right
because he had a brother in Wales who kept him informed about
London fashins reglar This was a infamus falsehood But as
the ballud says which I heard a genlman in a new soot of black
close and white kid gloves sing tother night Never dont let
us Despise a Man because he wears a Raggid Coat I dont know as
we do by the way tho we genrally get out of his way pretty
rapid probly on account of the pity which tears our boosums for
his onhappy condition

This last remark is a sirkastic and witherin thrust at them
blotid peple who live in gilded saloons I thot Id explain my
meanin to you I frekently have to explain the meanin of my
remarks I know one manand hes a man of varid complishments
who often reads my articles over 20 times afore he can make
anything of em at all Our skoolmaster to home says this is a
pecoolerarity of geneyus My wife says it is a pecoolerarity of
infernal nonsens Shes a exceedin practycal woman I luv her
muchly however and humer her little ways Its a recklis
falshood that she henpecks me and the young man in our
neighborhood who said to me one evenin as I was mistenin my
diafram with a gentle cocktail at the villige tavunwho said to
me in these very langwidge Go home old man onless you desires
to have another teapot throwd at you by BJ probly regrets
havin said so

I said Betsy Jane is my wifes front name gentle yooth and I
permits no person to alood to her as BJ outside of the family
circle of which I am it principally myself Your other
observations I scorn and disgust and I must pollish you off

He was a ablebodied young man and remoovin his coat he
enquired if I wanted to be ground to powder I said Yes if
there was a Powdergrindist handy nothin would ford me greater
pleasure when he struck me a painful blow into my right eye
causin me to make a rapid retreat into the fireplace I hadnt
no idee that the enemy was so well organized But I rallied and
went for him in a rayther vigris style for my time of life His
parunts lived near by and I will simply state 15 minits had only
elapst after the first act when he was carried home on a shutter
His mama met the sollum procession at the door and after
keerfully looking her orfspring over she said

My son I see how it is distinctually Youve been foolin
round a Trashin Masheen You went in at the place where they put
the grain in cum out with the straw and you got up into the
thingamyjig and let the horses tred on you didnt you my son

The pen of no liven Orthur could describe that disfortnit young
mans sittywation more clearer But I was sorry for him and I
went and nussed him till he got well His reglar original
father being absent to the war I told him Id be a father to him
myself He smilt a sickly smile and said Id already been wus
than two fathers to him

I will here obsarve that fitin orter be allus avided excep in
extreem cases My principle is if a man smites me on the right
cheek Ill turn my left to him probly but if he insinooates
that my granmother wasnt all right Ill punch his hed But
fitin is misble bisniss genrally speakin and whenever any
enterprisin countryman of mine cums over here to scoop up a
Briton in the prize ring Im allus excessively tickled when he
gets scooped hisself which it is a sad fack has thus far been
the casemy only sorrer bein that tother feller wasnt scooped
likewise Its diffrently with scullin boats which is a manly
sport and I can only explain Mr Hamils resunt defeat in this
country on the grounds that he wasnt used to British water I
hope this explanation will be entirely satisfactry to all

As I remarked afore Im gettin on well Im aware that Im in
the great metroplis of the world and it doesnt make me onhappy
to admit the fack A man is a ass who dispoots it Thats all
that ails HIM I know there is sum peple who cum over here and
snap and snarl bout this and that I know one man who says it
is a shame and a disgrace that St Pauls Church isnt a older
edifiss he says it should be years and even ages older than it
is but I decline to hold myself responsible for the conduck of
this idyit simply because hes my countryman I spose every
civlised land is endowed with its full share of gibberin
idyits and it cant be helptleastways I cant think of any
effectooal plan of helpin it

Im a little sorry youve got politics over here but I shall not
diskuss em with nobody Tear me to pieces with wild omnibus
hosses and I wont diskuss em Ive had quite enuff of em at
home thank you I was at Birmingham tother night and went to
the great meetin for a few minits I hadnt been in the hall
long when a sternlookin artisan said to me

You ar from Wales

No I told him I didnt think I was A hidgyis thot flasht over
me It was of that onprincipled taler and I said Has my
clothin a Welchy appearance

Not by no means he answered and then he said And what is
your opinyin of the present crisis

I said I dont zackly know Have you got it very bad

He replied Sir it is sweepin England like the Cymoon of the
Desert

Wall I said let it sweep

He ceased me by the arm and said Let us glance at histry It
is now some two thousand years

Is it indeed I replied

Listin he fiercely cried it is only a little over two
thousand years since

Oh bother I remarkt let us go out and git some beer

No Sir I want no gross and sensual beer Ill not move from
this spot till I can vote Who ar you

I handed him my card which in addition to my name contains a
elabrit description of my show Now Sir I proudly said you
know me

I sollumly swear he sternly replied that I never heard of
you or your show in my life

And this man I cried bitterly calls hisself a intelligent
man and thinks he orter be allowed to vote What a holler
mockery

Ive no objection to evry intelligent man votin if he wants to
Its a pleasant amoosement no doubt but there is those whose
igrance is so dense and loathsum that they shouldnt be trustid
with a ballit any moren one of my trained serpunts should be
trusted with a child to play with

I went to the station with a view of returnin to town on the
cars

This way Sir said the guard here you ar and he pinted to
a firstclass carriage the sole ockepant of which was a rayther
prepossessin female of about 30 summers

No I thank you I earnestly replied I prefer to walk

I am dear Sir
 Very respectivly yours
 Artemus WArd

53 THE GREEN LION AND OLIVER CROMWELL

MR PUNCH My Dear SirIt is now two weeks since a rayther
strange lookin man engaged partments at the Green Lion He
stated he was from the celebrated United States but beyond this
he said nothin He seemd to prefer sollytood He remained
mostly in his room and whenever he did show hisself he walkt in
a moody and morose manner in the garding with his hed bowed down
and his arms foldid across his brest He reminded me sumwhat of
the celebrated but onhappy Mr Haller in the cheerful play of
The Stranger This man puzzled me Id been puzzled afore
several times but never so severally as now Mine Ost of the
Greenlion said I must interregate this strange bein who claimed
to be my countryman

He hasnt called for a drop of beer since hes been in this ere
Ouse said the landlord I look to you he added to clear
up this dark this orful mistry

I wringed the lanlords honest hand and told him to consider
the mistry cleared up

I gained axes to the misterus beins room and by talkin sweet to
him for a few minits I found out who he was Then returnin to
the lanlord who was nervisly pacin up and down the bar I said

Sweet ROLANDO dont tremble no more Ive torn the marsk from
the hawty strangers face and dived into the recesses of his
inmost sole Hes a TransMejim

Id been to the Beefanham theatre the previs evenin and probly
the drammer I saw affected me because Im not in the habit of
goin on as per above I like the Beefanham theatre very much
indeed because there a enthoosiastic lover of the theatre like
myself can unite the legitermit drammer with fish Thus while
your enrapterd soul drinks in the lorfty and noble sentences of
the gifted artists you can eat a biled mackril jest as
comforbly as in your own house I felt constrained however to
tell a fond mother who sot immegitly behind me and who was
accompanied by a gin bottle and a young infantI felt
constrained to tell that mother when her infant playfully
mingled a rayther oily mackril with the little hair which is
left on my venerble hed that I had a bottle of scented hair oil
at home which on the whole I thot I preferred to that which her
orfspring was greasin me with This riled the excellent feamale
and she said

Git out You never was a infank yourself I spose Oh no You
was too good to be a infank you was You slid into the world
all ready growd didnt you Git out

No Madam I replied I too was once a infant I was a luvly
child People used to come in large and enthoosiastic crowds
from all parts of the country to see me I was such a sweet and
intelgent infant The excitement was so intens in fack that a
extra hotel was startid in the town to accomodate the peple who
thronged to my cradle Havin finished these troothful
statemints I smilt sweetly on the worthy female She said

Drat you what do you come achaffin me for and the estymible
woman was really gettin furis when I mollyfied her by praisin
her child and by axin pardin for all Id said

This little gal I observed this surprisingly lively gal
when the mother said

Its tother sect is he Sir its a boy

Wall I said then this little boy whose eye is like a eagle
asoaring proudly in the azure sky will some day be a man if he
dont choke hisself to death in childhoods sunny hours with a
smelt or a bloater or some other drefful calamity How surblime
the thot my dear Madam that this infant as you fondle on your
knee on this night may grow up into a free and independent
citizen whose vote will be worth from ten to fifteen pounds
accordin as suffrage may range at that joyous perid

Let us now return jentle reader to the lanlord of the Green
Lion who we left in the bar in a state of anxiety and perspire
Rubbin his hot face with a red handkercher he said Is the
strange bein a American

He is

A Genral

No

A Colonial

No

A Majer

Not a Majer

A Capting

He is not

A leftenant

Not even that

Then said the lanlord of the Green Lion you ar deceeved
He is no countryman of yours

Why not I said

I will tell you Sir said the lanlord My soninlaw is
employed in a bankin house where evry American as comes to these
shores goes to git his drafts casht and he says that not one has
arrived on these shores during the last 18 months as wasnt a
Genral a Colonial a Majer a Capting or a leftenant This
man as I said afore has deceeved you Hes a imposture

I reeled into a chair For a minit I was speechlis At length I
murmured Alars I fear it is too troo Even I was a Capting
of the Home Gards

To be sure said the lanlord you all do it over there

Wall I said whatever nation this person belongs to we may
as well go and hear him lectur this evenin He is one of these
spirit fellershe is a TransMejim and when he slings himself
into a transstate he says the sperits of departed great men talk
through him He says that tonight sevril emnent persons will
speak through himamong others Cromwell

And this Mr Cromwellis he dead said the lanlord

I told him that Oliver was no more

Its a umbug said the lanlord to which I replied that wed
best go and see and we went We was late on account of the
lanlords extensiv acquaintans with the public house keepers
along the road and the hall was some two miles distant but we
got there at last The hall was about half full and the Mejim
was just then assumin to be Benjamin Franklin who was speakin
about the Atlantic Cable

He said the Cable was really a merrytorious affair and that
messiges could be sent to America and there was no doubt about
their gettin there in the course of a week or two which he said
was a beautiful idear and much quicker than by steamer or
canalboat It struck me that if this was Franklin a spiritooal
life hadnt improved the old gentlemans intellecks particly

The audiens was mostly composed of rayther pale peple whose eyes
I thot rolled round in a somewhat wild manner But they was
wellbehaved and the females kept saying How beautiful What
a surblime thing it is et cetry et cetry Among the females
was one who was a fair and rosy young woman She sot on the same
seat we did and the lanlord of the Green Lion whose frekent
intervoos with other lanlords that evenin had been too much for
him fastened his left eye on the fair and rosy young person and
smilin lovinly upon her said

You may give me my dear fourpennyworth of gincold gin I
take it cold because

There was cries of Silence Shame Put him out The Skoffer

Aint we at the Spotted Boar the lanlord hoarsely whispered

No I answered Its another kind of bore Lisen Cromwell
is goin to speak through our inspired fren now

Is he said the lanlordis he Wall Ive suthin to say
also Was this Cromwell a licensed vittler

Not that I ever heard I anserd

Im sorry for that said the lanlord with a sigh but you
think he was a man who would wish to see licensed vittlers
respected in their rights

No doubt

Wall said the lanlord jest you keep a eye on me Then
risin to his feet he said in somewhat husky yet tolbly distink
voice Mr Crumbwell

Cromwell I cried

Yes Mr Cromwell thats the man I mean Mr Cromble wont
you please advise that genlman who youre talkin through wont
you adviseim during your elekant speech to settle his bill at my
ouse tonight Mr Crumbles said the lanlord glarin savigely
round on the peple because if he dont therell be a punched
ed to be seen at the Green Lion where I dont want no more of
this everlastin nonsens ILL talk through im Heres a
sperrit said the lanlord a smile once more beamin on his
face which will talk through him like a Dutch father Im the
sperrit for you young feller

Youre a helthy old sperret I remarkt and then I saw the
necessity of gettin him out of the hall The wimin was yellin
and screaming and the men was hollerin perlice A perliceman
really came and collerd my fat fren

Its only a fit Sir Richard I said I always call the
perlice Sir Richard It pleases them to think Im the victim of
a deloosion and they always treat me perlitely This one did
certainly for he let us go We saw no more of the TransMejim

Its diffikilt of course to say how long these noosances will
be allowed to prowl round I should say however if pressed for
a answer that they will probly continner on jest about as long
as they can find peple to lisen to em Am I right

 Yours faithfull

54 AT THE TOMB OF SHAKSPEARE

Mr Punch My dear SirIve been lingerin by the Tomb of the
lamentid Shakspeare

It is a success

I do not hestate to pronounce it as such

You may make any use of this opinion that you see fit If you
think its publication will subswerve the cause of litteraoor you
may publicate it

I told my wife Betsy when I left home that I should go to the
birthplace of the orthur of Otheller and other Plays She said
that as long as I kept out of Newgate she didnt care where I
went

But I said dont you know he was the greatest Poit that ever
lived Not one of these common poits like that young idyit who
writes verses to our daughter about the Roses as growses and
the Breezes as blowsesbut a Boss Poitalso a philosopher also
a man who knew a great deal about everything

She was packing my things at the time and the only answer she
made was to ask me if I was goin to carry both of my red flannel
nightcaps

Yes Ive been to Stratford onto the Avon the Birthplace of
Shakspeare Mr S is now no more Hes been dead over three
hundred 300 years The peple of his native town are justly
proud of him They cherish his memry and them as sell pictures
of his birthplace c make it proftible cherishin it Almost
everybody buys a pictur to put into their Albiom

As I stood gazing on the spot where Shakspeare is sposed to have
fell down on the ice and hurt hisself when a boy this spot
cannot be boughtthe town authorities say it shall never be
taken from Stratford I wondered if three hundred years hence
picturs of MY birthplace will be in demand Will the peple of my
native town be proud of me in three hundred years I guess they
wont short of that time because they say the fat man weighing
1000 pounds which I exhibited there was stuffed out with pillers
and cushions which he said one very hot day in July Oh bother
I cant stand this and commenced pullin the pillers out from
under his weskit and heavin em at the audience I never saw a
man lose flesh so fast in my life The audience said I was a
pretty man to come chiselin my own townsmen in that way I said
Do not be angry fellercitizens I exhibited him simply as a
work of art I simply wished to show you that a man could grow
fat without the aid of codliver oil But they wouldnt listen
to me They are a low and grovelin set of peple who excite a
feelin of loathin in every brest where lorfty emotions and
original idees have a bidin place

I stopped at Leamington a few minits on my way to Stratford onto
the Avon and a very beautiful town it is I went into a shoe
shop to make a purchis and as I entered I saw over the door
those dear familiar words By Appintment HRH and I said
to the man Squire excuse me but this is too much I have
seen in London four hundred boot and shoe shops by Appintment
HRH and now YOURE at it It is simply onpossible that the
Prince can wear 400 pairs of boots Dont tell me I said in a
voice choked with emotionOh do not tell me that you also make
boots for him Say slipperssay that you mend a boot now and
then for him but do not tell me that you make em reglar for
him

The man smilt and said I didnt understand these things He
said I perhaps had not noticed in London that dealers in all
sorts of articles was By Appintment I said Oh HADNT I
Then a sudden thought flasht over me I have it I said
When the Prince walks through a street he no doubt looks at the
shop windows

The man said No doubt

And the enterprisin tradesman I continnerd the moment the
Prince gets out of sight rushes frantically and has a tin sign
painted By Appintment HRH It is a beautiful a great
idee

I then bought a pair of shoe strings and wringin the shopmans
honest hand I started for the Tomb of Shakspeare in a hired fly
It lookt however more like a spider

And this I said as I stood in the old churchyard at
Stratford beside a Tombstone this marks the spot where lies
William W Shakspeare Alars and this is the spot where

Youve got the wrong grave said a mana worthy villager
Shakspeare is buried inside the church

Oh I said a boy told me this was it The boy larfed and
put the shillin Id given him onto his left eye in a inglorious
manner and commenced moving backwards towards the street

I pursood and captered him and after talking to him a spell in a
skarcastic stile I let him went

The old church was damp and chill It was rainin The only
persons there when I entered was a fine bluff old gentleman who
was talking in a excited manner to a fashnibly dressed young man

No Earnest Montresser the old gentleman said it is idle to
pursoo this subjeck no further You can never marry my daughter
You were seen last Monday in Piccadilly without a umbreller I
said then as I say now any young man as venturs out in a
uncertain climit like this without a umbreller lacks foresight
caution strength of mind and stability and he is not a proper
person to intrust a daughters happiness to

I slapt the old gentleman on the shoulder and I said Youre
right Youre one of those kind of men you are

He wheeled suddenly round and in a indignant voice said Go
waygo way This is a privit intervoo

I didnt stop to enrich the old gentlemans mind with my
conversation I sort of inferred that he wasnt inclined to
listen to me and so I went on But he was right about the
umbreller Im really delighted with this grand old country
Mr Punch but you must admit that it does rain rayther
numerously here Whether this is owing to a monerkal form of
govment or not I leave all candid and onprejudiced persons to
say

William Shakspeare was born in Stratford in 1564 All the
commentaters Shaksperian scholars etsetry are agreed on this
which is about the only thing they are agreed on in regard to
him except that his mantle hasnt fallen onto any poet or
dramatist hard enough to hurt said poet or dramatist MUCH And
there is no doubt if these commentaters and persons continner
investigating Shakspeares career we shall not in doo time
know anything about it at all

When a mere lad little William attended the Grammar School
because as he said the Grammar School wouldnt attend him
This remarkable remark comin from one so young and inexperunced
set peple to thinkin there might be somethin in this lad He
subsequently wrote Hamlet and George Barnwell When his kind
teacher went to London to accept a position in the offices of the
Metropolitan Railway little William was chosen by his fellow
pupils to deliver a farewell address

Go on Sir he said in a glorus career Be like a eagle and
soar and the soarer you get the more we shall all be gratified
Thats so

My young readers who wish to know about Shakspeare better get
these vallyable remarks framed

I returned to the hotel Meetin a young married couple they
asked me if I could direct them to the hotel which Washington
Irving used to keep

Ive understood that he was onsuccessful as a lanlord said
the lady

Weve understood said the young man that he busted up

I told em I was a stranger and hurried away They were from my
country and ondoubtedly represented a thrifty Ile well somewhere
in Pennsylvany Its a common thing by the way for a old farmer
in Pennsylvany to wake up some mornin and find ile squirtin all
around his back yard He sells out for normous price and his
children put on gorgeous harness and start on a tower to astonish
people They succeed in doin it Meantime the Ile squirts and
squirts and Time rolls on Let it roll

A very nice old town is Stratford and a capital inn is the Red
Horse Every admirer of the great S must go there once
certinly and to say one isnt a admirer of him is equvlent to
sayin one has jest about brains enough to become a efficient
tinker

Some kind person has sent me Chawcers poems Mr C had
talent but he couldnt spel No man has a right to be a
litrary man onless he knows how to spel It is a pity that
Chawcer who had geneyus was so unedicated Hes the wuss
speller I know of

I guess Im through and so I lay down the pen which is more
mightier than the sword but which Im fraid would stand a
rayther slim chance beside the needle gun

 Adoo Adoo

55 IS INTRODUCED AT THE CLUB


MR PUNCH My dear SirIt is seldim that the Commercial
relations between Great Britain and the United States is mard
by Games

It is Commerce after all which will keep the two countries
friendly toards each other rather than statesmen

I look at your last Parliament and I cant see that a single
speech was encored during the entire session

Look at Congressbut no Id rather not look at Congress

Entertainin this great regard for Commerce whose sales whiten
every sea as everybody happily observes every chance he gets I
learn with disgust and surprise that a British subjeck bot a
Barril of Apple Sass in America recently and when he arrove home
he found under a few deloosiv layers of sass nothin but sawdust
I should have instintly gone into the City and called a meetin of
the leadin commercial men to condemn and repudiate as a
American this gross frawd if I hadnt learned at the same time
that the draft given by the British subjeck in payment for this
frawdylent sass was drawed onto a Bankin House in London which
doesnt have a existance but far otherwise and never did

There is those who larf at these things but to me they merit
rebooks and frowns

With the exception of my Uncle Wilyimwho as Ive before
stated is a uncle by marrige only who is a low cuss and filled
his coat pockets with pies and biled eggs at his weddin
breakfast given to him by my father and made the clergyman as
united him a present of my fathers new overcoat and when my
father on discoverin it got in a rage and denounced him Uncle
Wilyim said the old man meanin my parent hadnt any idee of
first class Humerwith the exception of this wretched Uncle the
escutchin of my famly has never been stained by Games The
little harmless deceptions I resort to in my perfeshion I do not
call Games They are sacrifisses to Art

I come of a very clever famly

The Wards is a very clever famly indeed

I believe we are descendid from the Puritins who nobly fled from
a land of despitism to a land of freedim where they could not
only enjoy their own religion but prevent everybody else from
enjoyin HIS

As I said before we are a very clever famly

I was strolling up Regent Street the other day thinkin what a
clever famly I come of and looking at the gay shopwinders
Ive got some new close since you last saw me I saw them others
wouldnt do They carrid the observer too far back into the dim
vister of the past and I gave em to a Orfun Asylum The close
I wear now I bot of Mr Moses in the Commercial Road They was
expressly made Mr Moses inforemd me for a nobleman but as
they fitted him too muchly particly the trowsrs which is
blue with large red and white checks he had said

My dear feller make me some more only mindbe sure you sell
these to some genteel old feller

I like to saunter thro Regent Street The shops are pretty and
it does the old mans hart good to see the troops of fine healthy
girls which one may always see there at certain hours in the
afternoon who dont spile their beauty by devourin cakes and
sugar things as too many of the American and French lasses do
Its a mistake about everybody being out of town I guess
Regent Street is full Im here and as I said before I come of
a very clever famly

As I was walkin along amoosin myself by stickin my penknife into
the calves of the footmen who stood waitin by the swellcoaches
not one of whom howled with angwish I was accosted by a man of
about thirtyfive summers who said I have seen that face
somewheres afore

He was a little shabby in his wearin apparil His coat was one
of those black shiny garments which you can always tell have
been burnished by adversity but he was very gentlemanly

Was it in the Crimea comrade Yes it was It was at the
stormin of Sebastopol where I had a narrow escape from death
that we met

I said No I wasnt at Sebastopol I escaped a fatal wound by
not bein there It was a healthy old fortress I added

It was But it fell It came down with a crash

And plucky boys they was who brought her down I added and
hurrah for em

The man graspt me warmly by the hand and said he had been in
America Upper Canada Africa Asia Minor and other towns and
hed never met a man he liked as much as he did me

Let us he added let us to the shrine of Bachus

And he dragged me into a public house I was determined to pay
so I said Mr Bachus giv this genlman what he calls for

We conversed there in a very pleasant manner till my dinnertime
arrove when the agreeable gentleman insisted that I should dine
with him Well have a banquet Sir fit for the gods

I told him good plain vittles would soot me If the gods wanted
to have the dispepsy they was welcome to it

We had soop and fish and a hot jint and growsis and wines of
rare and costly vintige We had ices and we had froots from
Greenlands icy mountins and Injys coral strands and when the
sumptoous reparst was over the agreeble man said hed
unfortnitly left his pocketbook at home on the marble centre
table

But by Jove he said it was a feast fit for the gods

I said Oh never mind and drew out my puss tho I inardly
wished the gods as the dinner was fit for em was there to pay
for it

I come of a very clever famly

The agreeble gentleman then said Now I will show you our
Club It dates back to the time of William the Conquerer

Did Bill belong to it I inquired

He did

Wall I said if Billy was one of em I need no other
endorsement as to its respectfulness and Ill go with you my
gay trooper boy And we went off arminarm

On the way the agreeble man told me that the Club was called the
Sloshers He said I would notice that none of em appeared in
evenin dress He said it was agin the rools of the club In
fack if any member appeared there in evenin dress hed be
instantly expeld And yit he added theres geneyus there
and lorfty emotions and intelleck Youll be surprised at the
quantities of intelleck youll see there

We reached the Sloshers in due time and I must say they was a
shakylooking lot and the public house where they convened was
certingly none of the best

The Sloshers crowded round me and said I was welcome

What a beautiful brestpin youve got said one of em
Permit me and he took it out of my neckercher Isnt it
luvly he said parsin it to another who parsed it to another

It was given me by my Aunt on my promisin her Id never swear
profanely and I never have except on very special occasions I
see that beautiful boosum pin a parsin from one Slosher to
another and Im reminded of them sad words of the poit parsin
away parsin away I never saw it no more

Then in comes a athletic female who no sooner sees me than she
utters a wild yell and cries

At larst at larst My Wilyim from the seas

I said not at all Marm Not on no account I have heard the
boatswain pipe to quartersbut a voice in my heart didnt
whisper Seuzan Ive belayed the marlinspikes on the upper
jibpoop but Seuzans eye wasnt on me much Young woman I
am not youre Saler boy Far different

Oh yes you are she howled seizin me round the neck Oh
how Ive lookt forwards to this meetin

And youll presently I said have a opportunity of lookin
backwards to it because Im on the point of leavin this
institution

I will here observe that I come of a very clever family A very
clever famly indeed

Where I cried as I struggled in vain to release myself from
the eccentric females claws where is the Captingthe man who
was into the Crimea amidst the cannons thunder I want him

He came forward and cried What do I see Me Sister me sweet
Adulaide and in teers Willin he screamed and youre the
serpent I took to my boosum and borrowed money of and went
round with and was cheerful with are youYou ought to be
ashamed of yourself

Somehow my coat was jerked off the brestpocket of which
contained my pocketbook and it parsed away like the brest pin
Then they sorter quietly hustled me into the street

It was about 12 at night when I reached the Green Lion

Ha ha you sly old rascal youve been up to larks said the
lanlord larfin loudly and digging his fist into my ribs

I said Bigsby if you do that agin I shall hit you Much as I
respect you and your excellent famly I shall disfiger your
beneverlent countenance for life

What has ruffled your spirits friend said the lanlord

My spirits has been ruffled I ansered in a bittur voice by a
viper who was into the Crimea What good was it I cried for
Sebastopol to fall down without enwelopin in its ruins that
viper

I then went to bed I come of a very clever famly

56 THE TOWER OF LONDON

MR PUNCH My dear SirI skurcely need inform you that your
excellent Tower is very poplar with peple from the agricultooral
districks and it was chiefly them class which I found waitin at
the gates the other mornin

I saw at once that the Tower was established on a firm basis In
the entire history of firm basisis I dont find a basis more
firmer than this one

You have no Tower in America said a man in the crowd who had
somehow detected my denomination

Alars no I ansered we boste of our enterprise and
improvements and yit we are devoid of a Tower America oh my
onhappy country thou hast not got no Tower Its a sweet Boon

The gates was opened after awhile and we all purchist tickets
and went into a waitinroom

My frens said a palefaced little man in black close this
is a sad day

Inasmuch as to how I said

I mean it is sad to think that so many peple have been killed
within these gloomy walls My frens let us drop a tear

No I said you must excuse me Others may drop one if they
feel like it but as for me I decline The early managers of
this institootion were a bad lot and their crimes were trooly
orful but I cant sob for those who died four or five hundred
years ago If they was my own relations I couldnt Its absurd
to shed sobs over things which occurd during the rain of Henry
the Three Let us be cheerful I continnerd Look at the festiv
Warders in their red flannil jackets They are cheerful and
why should it not be thusly with us

A Warder now took us in charge and showed us the Traters Gate
the armers and things The Traters Gate is wide enuff to admit
about twenty traters abrest I should jedge but beyond this I
couldnt see that it was superior to gates in genral

Traters I will here remark are a onfortnit class of peple If
they wasnt they wouldnt be traters They conspire to bust up
a countrythey fail and theyre traters They bust her and
they become statesmen and heroes

Take the case of Gloster afterwards Old Dick the Three who may
be seen at the Tower on horseback in a heavy tin overcoattake
Mr Glosters case Mr G was a conspirater of the basist dye
and if hed failed he would have been hung on a sour apple tree
But Mr G succeeded and became great He was slewd by Col
Richmond but he lives in histry and his equestrian figger may
be seen daily for a sixpence in conjunction with other emnent
persons and no extra charge for the Warders able and bootiful
lectur

Theres one king in the room who is mounted onto a foamin steed
his right hand graspin a barbers pole I didnt learn his name

The room where the daggers and pistils and other weppins is kept
is interestin Among this collection of choice cutlery I notist
the bow and arrer which those hotheded old chaps used to conduct
battles with It is quite like the bow and arrer used at this
day by certin tribes of American Injuns and they shoot em off
with such a excellent precision that I almost sighd to be a
Injun when I was in the Rocky Mountain regin They are a
pleasant lot them Injuns Mr Cooper and Dr Catlin have told us
of the red mans wonerful eloquence and I found it so Our
party was stopt on the plains of Utah by a band of Shoshones
whose chief said

 Brothers the paleface is welcome Brothers the sun is
sinkin in the West and Wanabuckyshe will soon cease speakin
Brothers the poor red man belongs to a race which is fast
becomin extink

He then whooped in a shrill manner stole all our blankets and
whisky and fled to the primeval forest to conceal his emotions

I will remark here while on the subjeck of Injuns that they are
in the main a very shaky set with even less sense than the
Fenians and when I hear philanthropists bewailin the fack that
every year carries the noble red man nearer the settin sun I
simply have to say Im glad of it tho it is rough on the settin
sun They call you by the sweet name of Brother one minit and
the next they scalp you with their Thomashawks But I wander
Let us return to the Tower

At one end of the room where the weppins is kept is a wax figger
of Queen Elizabeth mounted on a fiery stuffed hoss whose glass
eye flashes with pride and whose red morocker nostril dilates
hawtily as if conscious of the royal burden he bears I have
associated Elizabeth with the Spanish Armady Shes mixed up
with it at the Surry Theatre where Troo to the Core is bein
acted and in which a full bally core is introjooced on board the
Spanish Admirals ship givin the audiens the idee that he
intends openin a moosichall in Plymouth the moment he conkers
that town But a very interesting drammer is Troo to the Core
notwithstandin the eccentric conduck of the Spanish Admiral and
very nice it is in Queen Elizabeth to make Martin Truegold a
baronet

The Warder shows us some instrooments of tortur such as
thumbscrews throatcollars etc statin that these was conkerd
from the Spanish Armady and addin what a crooil peple the
Spaniards was in them dayswhich elissited from a bright eyed
little girl of about twelve summers the remark that she thot it
WAS rich to talk about the crooilty of the Spaniards usin
thumbscrews when we was in a Tower where so many poor pepls
heads had been cut off This made the Warder stammer and turn
red

I was so blessed with the little girls brightness that I could
have kissed the dear child and I would if shed been six years
older

I think my companions intended makin a day of it for they all
had sandwiches sassiges etc The sadlookin man who had
wanted us to drop a tear afore we started to go round flingd
such quantities of sassige into his mouth that I expected to see
him choke hisself to death He said to me in the Beauchamp
Tower where the poor prisoners writ their onhappy names on the
cold walls This is a sad sight

It is indeed I anserd Youre black in the face You
shouldnt eat sassige in public without some rehearsals
beforehand You manage it orkwardly

No he said I mean this sad room

Indeed he was quite right Tho so long ago all these drefful
things happened I was very glad to git away from this gloomy
room and go where the rich and sparklin Crown Jewils is kept I
was so pleased with the Queens Crown that it occurd to me what
a agreeble surprise it would be to send a simlar one home to my
wife and I asked the Warder what was the vally of a good
wellconstructed Crown like that He told me but on cypherin up
with a pencil the amount of funs I have in the Jint Stock Bank I
conclooded Id send her a genteel silver watch instid

And so I left the Tower It is a solid and commandin edifis but
I deny that it is cheerful I bid it adoo without a pang

I was droven to my hotel by the most melancholly driver of a
fourwheeler that I ever saw He heaved a deep sigh as I gave
him two shillings

Ill give you six ds more I said if it hurts you so

It isnt that he said with a hartrendin groan its only a
way I have My minds upset today I at one time thot Id
drive you into the Thames Ive been readin in all the daily
papers to try and understand about Governor Ayre and my mind is
totterin Its really wonderful I didnt drive you into the
Thames

I asked the onhappy man what his number was so I could redily
find him in case I should want him agin and bad him goodbye
And then I thot what a frollicksome day Id made of it

 Respectably c
 Artemus Ward

57 SCIENCE AND NATURAL HISTORY

MR PUNCH My dear SirI was a little disapinted in not
receivin a invitation to jine in the meetins of the Social
Science Congress

I dont exackly see how they go on without me

I hope it wasnt the intentions of the Sciencers to exclood me
from their deliberations

Let it pars I do not repine Let us remember Homer Twenty
cities claim Homer dead thro which the livin Mr Homer couldnt
have got trusted for a sandwich and a glass of bitter beer or
words to that effect

But perhaps it was a oversight Certinly I have been hospitably
recd in this country Hospitality has been pored all over me
At Liverpool I was asked to walk all over the docks which are
nine miles along and I dont remember a instance since my rival
in London of my gettin into a cab without a Briton comin and
perlitly shuttin the door for me and then extendin his open hand
toards me in the most frenly manner possible Does he not by
this simple yit tuchin gesture welcum me to England Doesnt
he Oh yesI guess he doesnt he And its quite right among
two great countries which speak the same langwidge except as
regards Hs And Ive been allowed to walk round all the
streets Even at Buckinham Pallis I told a guard I wanted to
walk round there and he said I could walk round there I
ascertained subsequent that he referd to the sidewalk instid of
the Pallisbut I couldnt doubt his hospital feelins

I prepared a Essy on Animals to read before the Social Science
meetins It is a subjeck I may troothfully say I have
successfully wrastled with I tackled it when only nineteen
years old At that tender age I writ a Essy for a litry
Institoot entitled Is Cats to be Trusted Of the merits of
that Essy it doesnt becum me to speak but I may be excoosd for
mentionin that the Institoot parsed a resolution that whether we
look upon the length of this Essy or the manner in which it is
written we feel that we will not express any opinion of it and
we hope it will be read in other towns

Of course the Essy I writ for the Social Science Society is a
more finisheder production than the one on Cats which was wroten
when my mind was crood and afore I had masterd a graceful and
ellygant stile of composition I could not even punctooate my
sentences proper at that time and I observe with pane on lookin
over this effort of my yooth that its beauty is in one or two
instances mard by ingrammaticisms This was unexcusable and
Im surprised I did it A writer who cant write in a grammerly
manner better shut up shop

You shall hear this Essy on Animals Some day when you have four
hours to spare Ill read it to you I think youll enjoy it
Or what will be much better if I may suggestomit all picturs
in next weeks Punch and do not let your contributors write
enything whatever let them have a holiday they can go to the
British Mooseum and publish my Essy intire It will fill all
your collumes full and create comment Does this proposition
strike you Is it a go

In case I had read the Essy to the Social Sciencers I had
intended it should be the closin attraction I had intended it
should finish the proceedins I think it would have finished
them I understand animals better than any other class of human
creatures I have a very animal mind and Ive been identified
with em doorin my entire professional career as a showman more
especial bears wolves leopards and serpunts

The leopard is as lively a animal as I ever came into contack
with It is troo he cannot change his spots but you can change
em for him with a paintbrush as I once did in the case of a
leopard who wasnt natrally spotted in a attractive manner In
exhibitin him I used to stir him up in his cage with a protracted
pole and for the purpuss of making him yell and kick up in a
leopardy manner I used to casionally whack him over the head
This would make the children inside the booth scream with fright
which would make fathers of families outside the booth very
anxious to come inbecause there is a large class of parents who
have a uncontrollable passion for takin their children to places
where they will stand a chance of being frightened to death

One day I whacked this leopard more than ushil which elissited a
remonstrance from a tall gentleman in spectacles who said My
good man do not beat the poor caged animal Rather fondle him

Ill fondle him with a club I anserd hitting him another
whack

I prythy desist said the gentleman stand aside and see the
effeck of kindness I understand the idiosyncracies of these
creeturs better than you do

With that he went up to the cage and thrustin his face in
between the iron bars he said soothinly Come hither pretty
creetur

The pretty creetur comehithered rayther speedy and seized the
gentleman by the whiskers which he tore off about enuff to stuff
a small cushion with

He said You vagabone Ill have you indicted for exhibitin
dangerous and immoral animals

I replied Gentle Sir there isnt a animal here that hasnt a
beautiful moral but you mustnt fondle em You mustnt meddle
with their idiotsyncracies

The gentleman was a dramatic cricket and he wrote a article for
a paper in which he said my entertainment was a decided failure

As regards Bears you can teach em to do interesting things but
theyre onreliable I had a very large grizzly bear once who
would dance and larf and lay down and bow his head in grief
and give a mournful wale etsetry But he often annoyed me It
will be remembered that on the occasion of the first battle of
Bull Run it suddenly occurd to the Fedral soldiers that they
had business in Washington which ought not to be neglected and
they all started for that beautiful and romantic city
maintaining a rate of speed durin the entire distance that would
have done credit to the celebrated French steed Gladiateur
Very natrally our Govment was deeply grieved at this defeat
and I said to my Bear shortly after as I was givin a exhibition
in OhioI said Brewin are you not sorry the National arms has
sustained a defeat His business was to wale dismal and bow
his head down the band a barrel organ and a wiolin playin slow
and melancholly moosic What did the grizzly old cuss do
however but commence darncin and larfin in the most joyous
manner I had a narrer escape from being imprisoned for
disloyalty

I will relate another incident in the career of this retchid
Bear I used to present what I called in the bills a Beautiful
living Picturshowing the Bears fondness for his Master in
which Id lay down on a piece of carpeting and the Bear would
come and lay down beside me restin his right paw on my breast
the Band playing Home Sweet Home very soft and slow Altho
I say it it was a tuchin thing to see Ive seen TaxCollectors
weep over that performance

Well one day I said Ladies and Gentlemen we will show you the
Bears fondness for his master and I went and laid down I
thot I observed a pecooliar expression into his eyes as he
rolled clumsily toards me but I didnt dream of the scene which
follered He laid down and put his paw on my breast
Affection of the Bear for his Master I repeated You see the
Monarch of the Western Wilds in a subjugated state Fierce as
these animals naturally are we now see that they have hearts and
can love This Bear the largest in the world and measurin
seventeen feet round the body loves me as a merther loves her
cheild But what was my horror when the grizzly and infamus
Bear threw his other paw UNDER me and riz with me to his feet
Then claspin me in a close embrace he waltzed up and down the
platform in a frightful manner I yellin with fear and anguish
To make matters wuss a low scurrilus young man in the audiens
hollered out

Playfulness of the Bear Quick moosic

I jest scaped with my life The Bear met with a wiolent death
the next day by bein in the way when a hevily loaded gun was
fired off by one of my men

But you should hear my Essy which I wrote for the Social Science
Meetins It would have had a movin effeck on them

I feel that I must now conclood

I have read Earl Brights speech at Leeds and I hope we shall
now hear from John Derby I trust that not only they but Wm E
Stanley and Lord Gladstone will cling inflexibly to those great
fundamental principles which they understand far better than I
do and I will add that I do not understand anything about any of
them whatever in the leastand let us all be happy and live
within our means even if we have to borrer money to do it with

 Very respectfully yours

58 A VISIT TO THE BRITISH MUSEUM

MR PUNCH My dear SirYou didnt get a instructiv article from
my pen last week on account of my nervus sistim havin underwent a
dreffle shock I got caught in a brief shine of sun and it
utterly upsot me I was walkin in Regent Street one day last
week enjoyin your rich black fog and bracing rains when all at
once the Sun bust out and actooally shone for nearly half an hour
steady I acted promptly I called a cab and told the driver to
run his hoss at a friteful rate of speed to my lodgins but it
wasnt of no avale I had orful cramps and my appytite left me
and my pults went down to 10 degrees below zero But by careful
nussin I shall no doubt recover speedy if the present sparklin
and exileratin weather continners

All of the foregoin is sarcasum

Its a singlar fack but I never sot eyes on your excellent
British Mooseum till the other day Ive sent a great many peple
there as also to your genial Tower of London however It
happened thusly When one of my excellent countrymen jest
arrived in London would come and see me and display a
inclination to cling to me too lengthy thus showing a respect
for me which I feel I do not deserve I would sugjest a visit to
the Mooseum and Tower The Mooseum would ockepy him a day at
leest and the Tower another Thus Ive derived considerable
peace and comfort from them noble edifisses and I hope they will
long continner to grace your metroplis Theres my fren Col
Larkins from Wisconsin who I regret to say understands the
Jamaica question and wants to talk with me about it I sent him
to the Tower four days ago and he hasnt got throogh with it
yit He likes it very much and he writes me that he cant never
thank me sufficient for directin him to so interestin a bildin
I writ him not to mention it The Col says it is fortnit we
live in a intellectooal age which wouldnt countenance such
infamus things as occurd in this Tower Im aware that it is
fashinble to compliment this age but I aint so clear that the
Col is altogether right This is a very respectable age but
its pretty easily riled and considerin upon how slight a
provycation we who live in it go to cuttin each others throats
it may perhaps be doubted whether our intellecks is so much
massiver than our ancestors intellecks was after all

I allus ride outside with the cabman I am of humble parentage
but I have if you will permit me to say so the spirit of the
eagle which chafes when shut up in a fourwheeler and I feel
much eagler when Im in the open air So on the mornin on which
I went to the Mooseum I lit a pipe and callin a cab I told the
driver to take me there as quick as his Arabian charger could go
The driver was under the inflooence of beer and narrerly escaped
runnin over a aged female in the match trade whereupon I
remonstratid with him I said That poor old woman may be the
only mother of a young man like you Then throwing considerable
pathos into my voice I said

That poor old woman may be the only mother of a young man like
you Then throwing considerable pathos into my voice I said
You have a mother

He said You lie I got down and called another cab but said
nothin to this driver about his parents

The British Mooseum is a magnificent free show for the people
It is kept open for the benefit of all

The humble costymonger who traverses the busy streets with a
cart containin all kinds of vegetables such as carrots turnips
etc and drawn by a spirited jackasshe can go to the Mooseum
and reap benefits therefrom as well as the lord of high degree

And this I said is the British Mooseum These noble
walls I continnerd punching them with my umbreller to see if
the masonry was all rightbut I wasnt allowd to finish my
enthoosiastic remarks for a man with a gold band on his hat
said in a hash voice that I must stop pokin the walls I told
him I would do so by all means You see I said taking hold
of the tassel which waved from the mans belt and drawin him
close to me in a confidential way You see Im lookin round
this Mooseum and if I like it I shall buy it

Instid of larfin hartily at these remarks which was made in a
goakin spirit the man frowned darkly and walked away

I first visited the stuffed animals of which the gorillers
interested me most These simpleminded monsters live in Afriky
and are believed to be human beins to a slight extent altho
they are not allowed to vote In this department is one or two
superior giraffes I never woulded I were a bird but Ive
sometimes wished I was a giraffe on account of the long distance
from his mouth to his stummuck Hence if he loved beer one
mugful would give him as much enjoyment while goin down as forty
mugfuls would ordinary persons And he wouldnt get intoxicated
which is a beastly way of amusin oneself I must say I like a
little beer now and then and when the teetotallers inform us as
they frekently do that it is vile stuff and that even the swine
shrink from it I say it only shows that the swine is a ass who
dont know whats good but to pour gin and brandy down ones
throat as freely as though it were fresh milk is the most
idiotic way of goin to the devil that I know of

I enjoyed myself very much lookin at the Egyptian mummays the
Greek vasis etc but it occurd to me there was rayther too many
Roman antiquitys of a uncertin date Now I like the British
Mooseum as I said afore but when I see a lot of erthen jugs and
pots stuck up on shelves and all of a uncertin date Im at a
loss to zackly determin whether they are a thousand years old or
was bought recent I can cry like a child over a jug one
thousand years of age especially if it is a Roman jug but a jug
of a uncertin date doesnt overwhelm me with emotions Jugs and
pots of a uncertin age is doubtles vallyable property but like
the debentures of the London Chatham and Dover Railway a man
doesnt want too many of them

I was debarred out of the great readinroom A man told me I
must apply by letter for admission and that I must get somebody
to testify that I was respectable Im a little fraid I
shant get in there Seein a elderly gentleman with a
beneverlentlookin face near by I venturd to ask him if he would
certifythat I was respectable He said he certainly would not
but he would put me in charge of a policeman if that would do me
any good A thought struck me I refer you to Mr Punch I
said

Well said a man who had listened to my application you HAVE
done it now You stood some chance before

I will get this infamus wretchs name before you go to press so
you can denounce him in the present number of your excellent
journal

The statute of Apollo is a pretty slick statute A young yeoman
seemed deeply imprest with it He viewd it with silent
admiration At home in the beautiful rural districks where the
daisy sweetly blooms he would be swearin in a horrible manner at
his bullocks and whacking em over the head with a hayfork but
here in the presence of Art he is a changed bein

I told the attendant that if the British nation would stand the
expens of a marble bust of myself I would willingly sit to some
talented sculpist

I feel I said that this is a dooty I owe to posterity

He said it was hily probl but he was inclined to think that the
British nation wouldnt care to enrich the Mooseum with a bust of
me altho he venturd to think that if I paid for one myself it
would be accepted cheerfully by Madam Tussaud who would give it
a promnent position in her Chamber of Horrers The young man was
very polite and I thankt him kindly

After visitin the Refreshment room and partakin of half a chicken
of a uncertin age like the Roman antiquitys I have previsly
spoken of I prepared to leave As I passed through the animal
room I observed with pane that a benevolint person was urgin the
stufft elephant to accept a cold muffin but I did not feel
called on to remostrate with him any more than I did with two
young persons of diffrent sexes who had retired behind the
Rynosserhoss to squeeze each others hands In fack I rayther
approved of the latter proceedin for it carrid me back to the
sunny springtime of MY life Im in the shear and yeller leaf
now but I dont forgit the time when to squeeze my Betsys hand
sent a thrill through me like fellin off the roof of a twostory
house and I never squozed that gentle hand without wantin to do
so some more and feelin that it did me good

 Trooly yours
 Artemus Ward
