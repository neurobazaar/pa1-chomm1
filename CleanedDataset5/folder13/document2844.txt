THE FATAL BOOTS




JANUARYTHE BIRTH OF THE YEAR

Some poet has observed that if any man would write down what has really
happened to him in this mortal life he would be sure to make a good
book though he never had met with a single adventure from his birth to
his burial How much more then must I who HAVE had adventures most
singular pathetic and unparalleled be able to compile an instructive
and entertaining volume for the use of the public

I dont mean to say that I have killed lions or seen the wonders of
travel in the deserts of Arabia or Prussia or that I have been a very
fashionable character living with dukes and peeresses and writing my
recollections of them as the way now is I never left this my native
isle nor spoke to a lord except an Irish one who had rooms in our
house and forgot to pay three weeks lodging and extras but as our
immortal bard observes I have in the course of my existence been so
eaten up by the slugs and harrows of outrageous fortune and have been
the object of such continual and extraordinary illluck that I believe
it would melt the heart of a milestone to read of itthat is if a
milestone had a heart of anything but stone

Twelve of my adventures suitable for meditation and perusal during the
twelve months of the year have been arranged by me for this work They
contain a part of the history of a great and confidently I may say
a GOOD man I was not a spendthrift like other men I never wronged any
man of a shilling though I am as sharp a fellow at a bargain as any in
Europe I never injured a fellowcreature on the contrary on
several occasions when injured myself have shown the most wonderful
forbearance I come of a tolerably good family and yet born to
wealthof an inoffensive disposition careful of the money that I
had and eager to get moreI have been going down hill ever since
my journey of life began and have been pursued by a complication of
misfortunes such as surely never happened to any man but the unhappy Bob
Stubbs

Bob Stubbs is my name and I havent got a shilling I have borne the
commission of lieutenant in the service of King George and am NOWbut
never mind what I am now for the public will know in a few pages more
My father was of the Suffolk Stubbsesa welltodo gentleman of Bungay
My grandfather had been a respected attorney in that town and left my
papa a pretty little fortune I was thus the inheritor of competence
and ought to be at this moment a gentleman

My misfortunes may be said to have commenced about a year before my
birth when my papa a young fellow pretending to study the law in
London fell madly in love with Miss Smith the daughter of a tradesman
who did not give her a sixpence and afterwards became bankrupt My papa
married this Miss Smith and carried her off to the country where I was
born in an evil hour for me

Were I to attempt to describe my early years you would laugh at me as
an impostor but the following letter from mamma to a friend after her
marriage will pretty well show you what a poor foolish creature she
was and what a reckless extravagant fellow was my other unfortunate
parent


TO MISS ELIZA KICKS IN GRACECHURCH STREET LONDON

OH ELIZA your Susan is the happiest girl under heaven My Thomas is
an angel not a tall grenadierlike looking fellow such as I always
vowed I would marryon the contrary he is what the world would call
dumpy and I hesitate not to confess that his eyes have a cast in them
But what then when one of his eyes is fixed on me and one on my babe
they are lighted up with an affection which my pen cannot describe and
which certainly was never bestowed upon any woman so strongly as upon
your happy Susan Stubbs

When he comes home from shooting or the farm if you COULD see dear
Thomas with me and our dear little Bob as I sit on one knee and baby
on the other and as he dances us both about I often wish that we had
Sir Joshua or some great painter to depict the group for sure it is
the prettiest picture in the whole world to see three such loving merry
people

Dear baby is the most lovely little creature that CAN POSSIBLY
BEthe very IMAGE of papa he is cutting his teeth and the delight
of EVERYBODY Nurse says that when he is older he will get rid of his
squint and his hair will get a GREAT DEAL less red Doctor Bates is
as kind and skilful and attentive as we could desire Think what a
blessing to have had him Ever since poor babys birth it has never had
a day of quiet and he has been obliged to give it from three to four
doses every weekhow thankful ought we to be that the DEAR THING is
as well as it is It got through the measles wonderfully then it had
a little rash and then a nasty hoopingcough and then a fever and
continual pains in its poor little stomach crying poor dear child
from morning till night

But dear Tom is an excellent nurse and many and many a night has he
had no sleep dear man in consequence of the poor little baby He walks
up and down with it FOR HOURS singing a kind of song dear fellow he
has no more voice than a teakettle and bobbing his head backwards and
forwards and looking in his nightcap and dressinggown SO DROLL Oh
Eliza how you would laugh to see him

We have one of the best nursemaids IN THE WORLDan Irishwoman who is
as fond of baby almost as his mother but that can NEVER BE She takes
it to walk in the park for hours together and I really dont know why
Thomas dislikes her He says she is tipsy very often and slovenly
which I cannot conceiveto be sure the nurse is sadly dirty and
sometimes smells very strong of gin

But what of thatthese little drawbacks only make home more pleasant
When one thinks how many mothers have NO nursemaids how many poor dear
children have no doctors ought we not to be thankful for Mary Malowney
and that Dr Batess bill is fortyseven pounds How ill must dear baby
have been to require so much physic

But they are a sad expense these dear babies after all Fancy Eliza
how much this Mary Malowney costs us Ten shillings every week a glass
of brandy or gin at dinner three pintbottles of Mr Thrales best
porter every daymaking twentyone in a week and nine hundred and
ninety in the eleven months she has been with us Then for baby there
is Dr Batess bill of fortyfive guineas two guineas for christening
twenty for a grand christening supper and ball rich uncle John mortally
offended because he was made godfather and had to give baby a silver
cup he has struck Thomas out of his will and old Mr Firkin quite as
much hurt because he was NOT asked he will not speak to me or Thomas
in consequence twenty guineas for flannels laces little gowns caps
napkins and such babys ware and all this out of 300L a year But
Thomas expects to make A GREAT DEAL by his farm

We have got the most charming countryhouse YOU CAN IMAGINE it is
QUITE SHUT IN by trees and so retired that though only thirty miles
from London the post comes to us but once a week The roads it must be
confessed are execrable it is winter now and we are up to our knees
in mud and snow But oh Eliza how happy we are with Thomas he has
had a sad attack of rheumatism dear man and little Bobby and our
kind friend Dr Bates who comes so far to see us I leave you to
fancy that we have a charming merry party and do not care for all the
gayeties of Ranelagh

Adieu dear baby is crying for his mamma A thousand kisses from your
affectionate

SUSAN STUBBS


There it is Doctors bills gentlemanfarming twentyone pints of
porter a week In this way my unnatural parents were already robbing me
of my property




FEBRUARYCUTTING WEATHER

I have called this chapter cutting weather partly in compliment to
the month of February and partly in respect of my own misfortunes
which you are going to read about For I have often thought that January
which is mostly twelfthcake and holiday time is like the first four
or five years of a little boys life then comes dismal February and
the workingdays with it when chaps begin to look out for themselves
after the Christmas and the New Years heyday and merrymaking are over
which our infancy may well be said to be Well can I recollect that
bitter first of February when I first launched out into the world and
appeared at Doctor Swishtails academy

I began at school that life of prudence and economy which I have carried
on ever since My mother gave me eighteenpence on setting out poor
soul I thought her heart would break as she kissed me and bade God
bless me and besides I had a small capital of my own which I had
amassed for a year previous Ill tell you what I used to do Wherever
I saw six halfpence I took one If it was asked for I said I had taken
it and gave it backif it was not missed I said nothing about it as
why should Ithose who dont miss their money dont lose their money
So I had a little private fortune of three shillings besides mothers
eighteenpence At school they called me the coppermerchant I had such
lots of it

Now even at a preparatory school a wellregulated boy may better
himself and I can tell you I did I never was in any quarrels I never
was very high in the class or very low but there was no chap so much
respectedand why ID ALWAYS MONEY The other boys spent all
theirs in the first day or two and they gave me plenty of cakes and
barleysugar then I can tell you Id no need to spend my own money
for they would insist upon treating me Well in a week when theirs was
gone and they had but their threepence a week to look to for the
rest of the halfyear what did I do Why I am proud to say that
threehalfpence out of the threepence a week of almost all the young
gentlemen at Dr Swishtails came into my pocket Suppose for
instance Tom Hicks wanted a slice of gingerbread who had the money
Little Bob Stubbs to be sure Hicks I used to say ILL buy you
three halfporth of gingerbread if youll give me threepence next
Saturday And he agreed and next Saturday came and he very often
could not pay me more than threehalfpence Then there was the
threepence I was to have THE NEXT Saturday Ill tell you what I did
for a whole halfyearI lent a chap by the name of Dick Bunting
threehalfpence the first Saturday for threepence the next he could
not pay me more than half when Saturday came and Im blest if I did
not make him pay me threehalfpence FOR THREEANDTWENTY WEEKS
RUNNING making two shillings and tenpencehalfpenny But he was a sad
dishonorable fellow Dick Bunting for after Id been so kind to
him and let him off for threeandtwentyweeks the money he owed me
holidays came and threepence he owed me still Well according to the
common principles of practice after sixweeks holidays he ought to
have paid me exactly sixteen shillings which was my due For the

 First week the 3d would be 6d  Fourth week      4s
 Second week      1s  Fifth week      8s
 Third week      2s  Sixth week      16s

Nothing could be more just and yetwill it be believed when Bunting
came back he offered me THREEHALFPENCE the mean dishonest scoundrel

However I was even with him I can tell youHe spent all his money in
a fortnight and THEN I screwed him down I made him besides giving
me a penny for a penny pay me a quarter of his bread and butter
at breakfast and a quarter of his cheese at supper and before the
halfyear was out I got from him a silver fruitknife a box of
compasses and a very pretty silverlaced waistcoat in which I went
home as proud as a king and whats more I had no less than three
golden guineas in the pocket of it besides fifteen shillings the
knife and a brass bottlescrew which I got from another chap It
wasnt bad interest for twelve shillingswhich was all the money Id
had in the yearwas it Heigho Ive often wished that I could get such
a chance again in this wicked world but men are more avaricious now
than they used to be in those dear early days

Well I went home in my new waistcoat as fine as a peacock and when I
gave the bottlescrew to my father begging him to take it as a token of
my affection for him my dear mother burst into such a fit of tears as I
never saw and kissed and hugged me fit to smother me Bless him bless
him says she to think of his old father And where did you purchase
it BobWhy mother says I I purchased it out of my savings
which was as true as the gospelWhen I said this mother looked
round to father smiling although she had tears in her eyes and she
took his hand and with her other hand drew me to her Is he not a
noble boy says she to my father and only nine years oldFaith
says my father he IS a good lad Susan Thank thee my boy and here
is a crownpiece in return for thy bottlescrewit shall open us a
bottle of the very best too says my father And he kept his word
I always was fond of good wine though never from a motive of proper
selfdenial having any in my cellar and by Jupiter on this night I
had my little skinfulfor there was no stintingso pleased were my
dear parents with the bottlescrew The best of it was it only cost me
threepence originally which a chap could not pay me

Seeing this game was such a good one I became very generous towards my
parents and a capital way it is to encourage liberality in children
I gave mamma a very neat brass thimble and she gave me a halfguinea
piece Then I gave her a very pretty needlebook which I made myself
with an ace of spades from a new pack of cards we had and I got Sally
our maid to cover it with a bit of pink satin her mistress had given
her and I made the leaves of the book which I vandyked very nicely
out of a piece of flannel I had had round my neck for a sore throat
It smelt a little of hartshorn but it was a beautiful needlebook and
mamma was so delighted with it that she went into town and bought me a
goldlaced hat Then I bought papa a pretty china tobaccostopper but
I am sorry to say of my dear father that he was not so generous as my
mamma or myself for he only burst out laughing and did not give me so
much as a halfcrown piece which was the least I expected from him I
shant give you anything Bob this time says he and I wish my boy
you would not make any more such presentsfor really they are too
expensive Expensive indeed I hate meannesseven in a father

I must tell you about the silveredged waistcoat which Bunting gave
me Mamma asked me about it and I told her the truththat it was a
present from one of the boys for my kindness to him Well what does she
do but writes back to Dr Swishtail when I went to school thanking him
for his attention to her dear son and sending a shilling to the good
and grateful little boy who had given me the waistcoat

What waistcoat is it says the Doctor to me and who gave it to you

Bunting gave it me sir says I

Call Bunting and up the little ungrateful chap came Would you
believe it he burst into tearstold that the waistcoat had been given
him by his mother and that he had been forced to give it for a debt to
CopperMerchant as the nasty little blackguard called me He then
said how for threehalfpence he had been compelled to pay me
three shillings the sneak as if he had been OBLIGED to borrow the
threehalfpencehow all the other boys had been swindled swindled
by me in like mannerand how with only twelve shillings I had
managed to scrape together four guineas    

My courage almost fails me as I describe the shameful scene that
followed The boys were called in my own little accountbook was
dragged out of my cupboard to prove how much I had received from each
and every farthing of my money was paid back to them The tyrant took
the thirty shillings that my dear parents had given me and said he
should put them into the poorbox at church and after having made a
long discourse to the boys about meanness and usury he said Take off
your coat Mr Stubbs and restore Bunting his waistcoat I did and
stood without coat and waistcoat in the midst of the nasty grinning
boys I was going to put on my coat

Stop says he TAKE DOWN HIS BREECHES

Ruthless brutal villain Sam Hopkins the biggest boy took them
downhorsed meand I WAS FLOGGED SIR yes flogged O revenge I
Robert Stubbs who had done nothing but what was right was brutally
flogged at ten years of ageThough February was the shortest month I
remembered it long




MARCHSHOWERY

When my mamma heard of the treatment of her darling she was for bringing
an action against the schoolmaster or else for tearing his eyes out
when dear soul she would not have torn the eyes out of a flea had it
been her own injury and at the very least for having me removed from
the school where I had been so shamefully treated But papa was stern
for once and vowed that I had been served quite right declared that
I should not be removed from school and sent old Swishtail a brace
of pheasants for what he called his kindness to me Of these the old
gentleman invited me to partake and made a very queer speech at dinner
as he was cutting them up about the excellence of my parents and his
own determination to be KINDER STILL to me if ever I ventured on such
practices again So I was obliged to give up my old trade of lending
for the Doctor declared that any boy who borrowed should be flogged and
any one who PAID should be flogged twice as much There was no standing
against such a prohibition as this and my little commerce was ruined

I was not very high in the school not having been able to get farther
than that dreadful Propria quae maribus in the Latin grammar of which
though I have it by heart even now I never could understand a syllable
but on account of my size my age and the prayers of my mother was
allowed to have the privilege of the bigger boys and on holidays to
walk about in the town Great dandies we were too when we thus went
out I recollect my costume very well a thunderandlightning coat a
white waistcoat embroidered neatly at the pockets a lace frill a pair
of kneebreeches and elegant white cotton or silk stockings This did
very well but still I was dissatisfied I wanted A PAIR OF BOOTS Three
boys in the school had bootsI was mad to have them too

But my papa when I wrote to him would not hear of it and three
pounds the price of a pair was too large a sum for my mother to take
from the housekeeping or for me to pay in the present impoverished
state of my exchequer but the desire for the boots was so strong that
have them I must at any rate

There was a German bootmaker who had just set up in OUR town in those
days who afterwards made his fortune in London I determined to have
the boots from him and did not despair before the end of a year or
two either to leave the school when I should not mind his dunning me
or to screw the money from mamma and so pay him

So I called upon this manStiffelkind was his nameand he took my
measure for a pair

You are a vary yong gentleman to wear dopboots said the shoemaker

I suppose fellow says I that is my business and not yours Either
make the boots or notbut when you speak to a man of my rank speak
respectfully And I poured out a number of oaths in order to impress
him with a notion of my respectability

They had the desired effect Stay sir says he I have a nice littel
pair of dopboots dat I tink will jost do for you And he produced
sure enough the most elegant things I ever saw Day were made said
he for de Honorable Mr Stiffney of de Gards but were too small

Ah indeed said I Stiffney is a relation of mine And what you
scoundrel will you have the impudence to ask for these things He
replied Three pounds

Well said I they are confoundedly dear but as you will have a
long time to wait for your money why I shall have my revenge you see
The man looked alarmed and began a speech SareI cannot let dem go
vidoutbut a bright thought struck me and I interruptedSir dont
sir me Take off the boots fellow and hark ye when you speak to a
nobleman dont saySir

A hundert tousand pardons my lort says he if I had known you were
a lort I vood never have called youSir Vat name shall I put down in
my books

Nameoh why Lord Cornwallis to be sure said I as I walked off
in the boots

And vat shall I do vid my lorts shoes

Keep them until I send for them said I And giving him a patronizing
bow I walked out of the shop as the German tied up my shoes in paper



This story I would not have told but that my whole life turned upon
these accursed boots I walked back to school as proud as a peacock and
easily succeeded in satisfying the boys as to the manner in which I came
by my new ornaments

Well one fatal Monday morningthe blackest of all blackMondays that
ever I knewas we were all of us playing between schoolhours I saw a
posse of boys round a stranger who seemed to be looking out for one of
us A sudden trembling seized meI knew it was Stiffelkind What had
brought him here He talked loud and seemed angry So I rushed into
the schoolroom and burying my head between my hands began reading for
dear life

I vant Lort Cornvallis said the horrid bootmaker His lortship
belongs I know to dis honorable school for I saw him vid de boys at
chorch yesterday

Lord who

Vy Lort Cornvallis to be surea very fat yong nobeman vid red hair
he squints a little and svears dreadfully

Theres no Lord Cornvallis here said one and there was a pause

Stop I have it says that odious Bunting IT MUST BE STUBBS And
Stubbs Stubbs every one cried out while I was so busy at my book as
not to hear a word

At last two of the biggest chaps rushed into the schoolroom and
seizing each an arm run me into the playgroundbolt up against the
shoemaker

Dis is my man I beg your lortships pardon says he I have brought
your lortships shoes vich you left See dey have been in dis parcel
ever since you vent avay in my boots

Shoes fellow says I I never saw your face before For I knew
there was nothing for it but brazening it out Upon the honor of a
gentleman said I turning round to the boys They hesitated and if
the trick had turned in my favor fifty of them would have seized hold
of Stiffelkind and drubbed him soundly

Stop says Bunting hang him Lets see the shoes If they fit him
why then the cobblers right They did fit me and not only that but
the name of STUBBS was written in them at full length

Vat said Stiffelkind Is he not a lort So help me Himmel I never
did vonce tink of looking at de shoes which have been lying ever since
in dis piece of brown paper And then gathering anger as he went on
he thundered out so much of his abuse of me in his GermanEnglish that
the boys roared with laughter Swishtail came in in the midst of the
disturbance and asked what the noise meant

Its only Lord Cornwallis sir said the boys battling with his
shoemaker about the price of a pair of topboots

Oh sir said I it was only in fun that I called myself Lord
Cornwallis

In funWhere are the boots And you sir give me your bill My
beautiful boots were brought and Stiffelkind produced his bill Lord
Cornwallis to Samuel Stiffelkind for a pair of bootsfour guineas

You have been fool enough sir says the Doctor looking very stern
to let this boy impose on you as a lord and knave enough to charge him
double the value of the article you sold him Take back the boots sir
I wont pay a penny of your bill nor can you get a penny As for you
sir you miserable swindler and cheat I shall not flog you as I did
before but I shall send you home you are not fit to be the companion
of honest boys

SUPPOSE WE DUCK HIM before he goes piped out a very small voice The
Doctor grinned significantly and left the schoolroom and the boys
knew by this they might have their will They seized me and carried me
to the playground pump they pumped upon me until I was half dead
and the monster Stiffelkind stood looking on for the halfhour the
operation lasted

I suppose the Doctor at last thought I had had pumping enough for he
rang the schoolbell and the boys were obliged to leave me As I got
out of the trough Stiffelkind was alone with me Vell my lort says
he you have paid SOMETHING for dese boots but not all By Jubider
YOU SHALL NEVER HEAR DE END OF DEM And I didnt




APRILFOOLING

After this as you may fancy I left this disgusting establishment and
lived for some time along with pa and mamma at home My education was
finished at least mamma and I agreed that it was and from boyhood
until hobbadyhoyhood which I take to be about the sixteenth year of
the life of a young man and may be likened to the month of April
when spring begins to bloomfrom fourteen until seventeen I say I
remained at home doing nothingfor which I have ever since had a
great tastethe idol of my mamma who took part in all my quarrels with
father and used regularly to rob the weekly expenses in order to find
me in pocketmoney Poor soul many and many is the guinea I have had
from her in that way and so she enabled me to cut a very pretty figure

Papa was for having me at this time articled to a merchant or put
to some profession but mamma and I agreed that I was born to be a
gentleman and not a tradesman and the army was the only place for me
Everybody was a soldier in those times for the French war had just
begun and the whole country was swarming with militia regiments Well
get him a commission in a marching regiment said my father As we
have no money to purchase him up hell FIGHT his way I make no doubt
And papa looked at me with a kind of air of contempt as much as to say
he doubted whether I should be very eager for such a dangerous way of
bettering myself

I wish you could have heard mammas screech when he talked so coolly of
my going out to fight What send him abroad across the horrid horrid
seato be wrecked and perhaps drowned and only to land for the
purpose of fighting the wicked Frenchmento be wounded and perhaps
kickkickkilled Oh Thomas Thomas would you murder me and your
boy There was a regular scene However it endedas it always didin
mothers getting the better and it was settled that I should go into
the militia And why not The uniform is just as handsome and the
danger not half so great I dont think in the course of my whole
military experience I ever fought anything except an old woman who
had the impudence to hallo out Heads up lobsterWell I joined the
North Bungays and was fairly launched into the world

I was not a handsome man I know but there was SOMETHING about
methats very evidentfor the girls always laughed when they talked
to me and the men though they affected to call me a poor little
creature squinteyes knockknees redhead and so on were evidently
annoyed by my success for they hated me so confoundedly Even at the
present time they go on though I have given up gallivanting as I call
it But in the April of my existencethat is in anno Domini 1791 or
soit was a different case and having nothing else to do and being
bent upon bettering my condition I did some very pretty things in that
way But I was not hotheaded and imprudent like most young fellows
Dont fancy I looked for beauty PishI wasnt such a fool Nor for
temper I dont care about a bad temper I could break any womans heart
in two years What I wanted was to get on in the world Of course I
didnt PREFER an ugly woman or a shrew and when the choice offered
would certainly put up with a handsome goodhumored girl with plenty
of money as any honest man would

Now there were two tolerably rich girls in our parts Miss Magdalen
Crutty with twelve thousand pounds and to do her justice as plain a
girl as ever I saw and Miss Mary Waters a fine tall plump smiling
peachcheeked goldenhaired whiteskinned lass with only ten Mary
Waters lived with her uncle the Doctor who had helped me into the
world and who was trusted with this little orphan charge very soon
after My mother as you have heard was so fond of Bates and Bates
so fond of little Mary that both at first were almost always in our
house and I used to call her my little wife as soon as I could speak
and before she could walk almost It was beautiful to see us the
neighbors said

Well when her brother the lieutenant of an India ship came to be
captain and actually gave Mary five thousand pounds when she was about
ten years old and promised her five thousand more there was a great
talking and bobbing and smiling between the Doctor and my parents and
Mary and I were left together more than ever and she was told to call
me her little husband And she did and it was considered a settled
thing from that day She was really amazingly fond of me

Can any one call me mercenary after that Though Miss Crutty had twelve
thousand and Mary only ten five in hand and five in the bush I
stuck faithfully to Mary As a matter of course Miss Crutty hated Miss
Waters The fact was Mary had all the country dangling after her and
not a soul would come to Magdalen for all her 12000L I used to be
attentive to her though as its always useful to be and Mary would
sometimes laugh and sometimes cry at my flirting with Magdalen This I
thought proper very quickly to check Mary said I you know that my
love for you is disinterestedfor I am faithful to you though Miss
Crutty is richer than you Dont fly into a rage then because I pay
her attentions when you know that my heart and my promise are engaged
to you

The fact is to tell a little bit of a secret there is nothing like the
having two strings to your bow Who knows thought I Mary may die
and then where are my 10000L So I used to be very kind indeed to
Miss Crutty and well it was that I was so for when I was twenty and
Mary eighteen Im blest if news did not arrive that Captain Waters
who was coming home to England with all his money in rupees had been
takenship rupees self and allby a French privateer and Mary
instead of 10000L had only 5000L making a difference of no less
than 350L per annum betwixt her and Miss Crutty

I had just joined my regiment the famous North Bungay Fencibles
Colonel Craw commanding when this news reached me and you may fancy
how a young man in an expensive regiment and mess having uniforms and
what not to pay for and a figure to cut in the world felt at hearing
such news My dearest Robert wrote Miss Waters will deplore my
dear brothers loss but not I am sure the money which that kind and
generous soul had promised me I have still five thousand pounds and
with this and your own little fortune I had 1000L in the Five per
Cents we shall be as happy and contented as possible

Happy and contented indeed Didnt I know how my father got on with his
300L a year and how it was all he could do out of it to add a hundred
a year to my narrow income and live himself My mind was made up I
instantly mounted the coach and flew to our villageto Mr Cruttys
of course It was next door to Doctor Batess but I had no business
THERE

I found Magdalen in the garden Heavens Mr Stubbs said she as
in my new uniform I appeared before her I really did neversuch
a handsome officerexpect to see you And she made as if she would
blush and began to tremble violently I led her to a gardenseat I
seized her handit was not withdrawn I pressed itI thought the
pressure was returned I flung myself on my knees and then I poured
into her ear a little speech which I had made on the top of the coach
Divine Miss Crutty said I idol of my soul It was but to catch one
glimpse of you that I passed through this garden I never intended to
breathe the secret passion oh no of course not which was wearing
my life away You know my unfortunate preengagementit is broken
and FOR EVER I am freefree but to be your slaveyour humblest
fondest truest slave And so on    

Oh Mr Stubbs said she as I imprinted a kiss upon her cheek I
cant refuse you but I fear you are a sad naughty man    

Absorbed in the delicious reverie which was caused by the dear
creatures confusion we were both silent for a while and should have
remained so for hours perhaps so lost were we in happiness had I not
been suddenly roused by a voice exclaiming from behind us

DONT CRY MARY HE IS A SWINDLING SNEAKING SCOUNDREL AND YOU ARE
WELL RID OF HIM

I turned round O heaven there stood Mary weeping on Doctor Batess
arm while that miserable apothecary was looking at me with the utmost
scorn The gardener who had let me in had told them of my arrival
and now stood grinning behind them Imperence was my Magdalens only
exclamation as she flounced by with the utmost selfpossession while
I glancing daggers at the SPIES followed her We retired to the
parlor where she repeated to me the strongest assurances of her love

I thought I was a made man Alas I was only an APRIL FOOL




MAYRESTORATION DAY

As the month of May is considered by poets and other philosophers to
be devoted by Nature to the great purpose of lovemaking I may as well
take advantage of that season and acquaint you with the result of MY
amours

Young gay fascinating and an ensignI had completely won the heart
of my Magdalen and as for Miss Waters and her nasty uncle the
Doctor there was a complete split between us as you may fancy Miss
pretending forsooth that she was glad I had broken off the match
though she would have given her eyes the little minx to have had it on
again But this was out of the question My father who had all sorts of
queer notions said I had acted like a rascal in the business my mother
took my part in course and declared I acted rightly as I always
did and I got leave of absence from the regiment in order to press
my beloved Magdalen to marry me out of handknowing from reading and
experience the extraordinary mutability of human affairs

Besides as the dear girl was seventeen years older than myself and as
bad in health as she was in temper how was I to know that the grim
king of terrors might not carry her off before she became mine With the
tenderest warmth then and most delicate ardor I continued to press my
suit The happy day was fixedthe ever memorable 10th of May 1792
The weddingclothes were ordered and to make things secure I penned a
little paragraph for the county paper to this effectMarriage in High
Life We understand that Ensign Stubbs of the North Bungay Fencibles
and son of Thomas Stubbs of Sloffemsquiggle Esquire is about to lead
to the hymeneal altar the lovely and accomplished daughter of Solomon
Crutty Esquire of the same place A fortune of twenty thousand pounds
is we hear the ladys portion None but the brave deserve the fair



Have you informed your relatives my beloved said I to Magdalen one
day after sending the above notice will any of them attend at your
marriage

Uncle Sam will I dare say said Miss Crutty dear mammas brother

And who WAS your dear mamma said I for Miss Cruttys respected
parent had been long since dead and I never heard her name mentioned in
the family

Magdalen blushed and cast down her eyes to the ground Mamma was a
foreigner at last she said

And of what country

A German Papa married her when she was very youngshe was not of a
very good family said Miss Crutty hesitating

And what care I for family my love said I tenderly kissing the
knuckles of the hand which I held She must have been an angel who gave
birth to you

She was a shoemakers daughter

A GERMAN SHOEMAKER Hang em thought I I have had enough of them
and so broke up this conversation which did not somehow please me



Well the day was drawing near the clothes were ordered the banns were
read My dear mamma had built a cake about the size of a washingtub
and I was only waiting for a week to pass to put me in possession of
twelve thousand pounds in the FIVE per Cents as they were in those
days heaven bless em Little did I know the storm that was brewing
and the disappointment which was to fall upon a young man who really did
his best to get a fortune



Oh Robert said my Magdalen to me two days before the match was to
come off I have SUCH a kind letter from uncle Sam in London I wrote
to him as you wished He says that he is coming down tomorrow that he
has heard of you often and knows your character very well and that he
has got a VERY HANDSOME PRESENT for us What can it be I wonder

Is he rich my souls adored says I

He is a bachelor with a fine trade and nobody to leave his money to

His present cant be less than a thousand pounds says I

Or perhaps a silver teaset and some cornerdishes says she

But we could not agree to this it was too littletoo mean for a man
of her uncles wealth and we both determined it must be the thousand
pounds

Dear good uncle hes to be here by the coach says Magdalen Let
us ask a little party to meet him And so we did and so they came my
father and mother old Crutty in his best wig and the parson who was
to marry us the next day The coach was to come in at six And there
was the teatable and there was the punchbowl and everybody ready and
smiling to receive our dear uncle from London

Six oclock came and the coach and the man from the Green Dragon
with a portmanteau and a fat old gentleman walking behind of whom I
just caught a glimpsea venerable old gentleman I thought Id seen him
before



Then there was a ring at the bell then a scuffling and bumping in the
passage then old Crutty rushed out and a great laughing and talking
and HOW ARE YOU and so on was heard at the door and then the
parlordoor was flung open and Crutty cried out with a loud voice

Good people all my brotherinlaw Mr STIFFELKIND

MR STIFFELKINDI trembled as I heard the name

Miss Crutty kissed him mamma made him a curtsy and papa made him a
bow and Dr Snorter the parson seized his hand and shook it most
warmly then came my turn

Vat says he It is my dear goot yong frend from Doctor
Schvishentails is dis de yong gentlemans honorable moder mamma
smiled and made a curtsy and dis his fader Sare and madam you
should be broud of soch a sonn And you my niece if you have him for a
husband you vill be locky dat is all Vat dink you broder Croty and
Madame Stobbs I ave made your sonns boots Haha

My mamma laughed and said I did not know it but I am sure sir he
has as pretty a leg for a boot as any in the whole county

Old Stiffelkind roared louder A very nice leg maam and a very SHEAP
BOOT TOO Vat did you not know I make his boots Perhaps you did not
know something else toopraps you did not know and here the monster
clapped his hand on the table and made the punchladle tremble in
the bowlpraps you did not know as dat yong man dat Stobbs dat
sneaking baltry squinting fellow is as vicked as he is ogly He bot
a pair of boots from me and never paid for dem Dat is noting nobody
never pays but he bought a pair of boots and called himself Lord
Cornvallis And I was fool enough to believe him vonce But look you
niece Magdalen I ave got five tousand pounds if you marry him I vill
not give you a benny But look you what I will gif you I bromised you a
bresent and I will give you DESE

And the old monster produced THOSE VERY BOOTS which Swishtail had made
him take back



I DIDNT marry Miss Crutty I am not sorry for it though She was a
nasty ugly illtempered wretch and Ive always said so ever since

And all this arose from those infernal boots and that unlucky paragraph
in the county paperIll tell you how

In the first place it was taken up as a quiz by one of the wicked
profligate unprincipled organs of the London press who chose to be
very facetious about the Marriage in High Life and made all sorts of
jokes about me and my dear Miss Crutty

Secondly it was read in this London paper by my mortal enemy Bunting
who had been introduced to old Stiffelkinds acquaintance by my
adventure with him and had his shoes made regularly by that foreign
upstart

Thirdly he happened to want a pair of shoes mended at this particular
period and as he was measured by the disgusting old HighDutch cobbler
he told him his old friend Stubbs was going to be married

And to whom said old Stiffelkind To a voman wit geld I vill take
my oath

Yes says Bunting a country girla Miss Magdalen Carotty or Crotty
at a place called Sloffemsquiggle

SHLOFFEMSCHWIEGEL bursts out the dreadful bootmaker Mein Gott mein
Gott das geht nicht I tell you sare it is no go Miss Crotty is
my niece I vill go down myself I vill never let her marry dat
gootfornothing schwindler and tief SUCH was the language that the
scoundrel ventured to use regarding me




JUNEMARROWBONES AND CLEAVERS

Was there ever such confounded illluck My whole life has been a tissue
of illluck although I have labored perhaps harder than any man to make
a fortune something always tumbled it down In love and in war I was
not like others In my marriages I had an eye to the main chance and
you see how some unlucky blow would come and throw them over In the
army I was just as prudent and just as unfortunate What with judicious
betting and horseswapping goodluck at billiards and economy I do
believe I put by my pay every yearand that is what few can say who
have but an allowance of a hundred a year

Ill tell you how it was I used to be very kind to the young men I
chose their horses for them and their wine and showed them how to play
billiards or ecarte of long mornings when there was nothing better
to do I didnt cheat Id rather die than cheatbut if fellows WILL
play I wasnt the man to say nowhy should I There was one young chap
in our regiment of whom I really think I cleared 300L a year

His name was Dobble He was a tailors son and wanted to be a
gentleman A poor weak young creature easy to be made tipsy easy to
be cheated and easy to be frightened It was a blessing for him that I
found him for if anybody else had they would have plucked him of every
shilling

Ensign Dobble and I were sworn friends I rode his horses for him and
chose his champagne and did everything in fact that a superior mind
does for an inferiorwhen the inferior has got the money We were
inseparableshunting everywhere in couples We even managed to fall in
love with two sisters as young soldiers will do you know for the dogs
fall in love with every change of quarters

Well once in the year 1793 it was just when the French had chopped
poor Louiss head off Dobble and I gay young chaps as ever wore sword
by side had cast our eyes upon two young ladies by the name of Brisket
daughters of a butcher in the town where we were quartered The dear
girls fell in love with us of course And many a pleasant walk in the
country many a treat to a teagarden many a smart ribbon and brooch
used Dobble and I for his father allowed him 600L and our purses were
in common present to these young ladies One day fancy our pleasure at
receiving a note couched thus


DEER CAPTING STUBBS AND DOBBLEMiss Briskets presents their
compliments and as it is probble that our papa will be till twelve
at the corprayshun dinner we request the pleasure of their company to
tea


Didnt we go Punctually at six we were in the little backparlor we
quaffed more Bohea and made more love than half a dozen ordinary men
could At nine a little punchbowl succeeded to the little teapot and
bless the girls a nice fresh steak was frizzling on the gridiron for
our supper Butchers were butchers then and their parlor was their
kitchen too at least old Briskets wasone door leading into the
shop and one into the yard on the other side of which was the
slaughterhouse

Fancy then our horror when just at this critical time we heard the
shopdoor open a heavy staggering step on the flags and a loud husky
voice from the shop shouting Hallo Susan hallo Betsy show a
light Dobble turned as white as a sheet the two girls each as red as
a lobster I alone preserved my presence of mind The backdoor says
IThe dogs in the court say they Hes not so bad as the man
said I Stop cries Susan flinging open the door and rushing to the
fire Take THIS and perhaps it will quiet him

What do you think THIS was Im blest if it was not the STEAK

She pushed us out patted and hushed the dog and was in again in a
minute The moon was shining on the court and on the slaughterhouse
where there hung the white ghastlylooking carcasses of a couple of
sheep a great gutter ran down the courta gutter of BLOOD The dog
was devouring his beefsteak OUR beefsteak in silence and we could
see through the little window the girls hustling about to pack up the
supperthings and presently the shopdoor being opened old Brisket
entering staggering angry and drunk Whats more we could see
perched on a high stool and nodding politely as if to salute old
Brisket the FEATHER OF DOBBLES COCKED HAT When Dobble saw it he
turned white and deadly sick and the poor fellow in an agony of
fright sunk shivering down upon one of the butchers cuttingblocks
which was in the yard

We saw old Brisket look steadily as steadily as he could at the
confounded impudent pert waggling feather and then an idea began to
dawn upon his mind that there was a head to the hat and then he slowly
rose uphe was a man of six feet and fifteen stonehe rose up put on
his apron and sleeves and TOOK DOWN HIS CLEAVER

Betsy says he open the yard door But the poor girls screamed and
flung on their knees and begged and wept and did their very best
to prevent him OPEN THE YARD DOOR says he with a thundering loud
voice and the great bulldog hearing it started up and uttered a yell
which sent me flying to the other end of the courtDobble couldnt
move he was sitting on the block blubbering like a baby

The door opened and out Mr Brisket came

TO HIM JOWLER says he KEEP HIM JOWLERand the horrid dog flew
at me and I flew back into the corner and drew my sword determining
to sell my life dearly

Thats it says Brisket Keep him theregood doggood dog And
now sir says he turning round to Dobble is this your hat

Yes says Dobble fit to choke with fright

Well then says Brisket its myhicmy painful duty
tohicto tell you that as Ive got your hat I must have your
headits painful but it must be done Youd betterhicsettle
yourself comcomfumarably against thathicthat block and Ill
chop it off before you can say Jackhicno I mean Jack Robinson

Dobble went down on his knees and shrieked out Im an only son Mr
Brisket Ill marry her sir I will upon my honor sirConsider my
mother sir consider my mother

Thats it sir says Brisket thats a goodhica good boyjust
put your head down quietlyand Ill have it offyes offas if you
were Louis the Sixthe Sixtixthe SiktickleteenthIll chop the
other CHAP AFTERWARDS

When I heard this I made a sudden bound back and gave such a cry as
any man might who was in such a way The ferocious Jowler thinking I
was going to escape flew at my throat screaming furious I flung out
my arms in a kind of desperationand to my wonder down fell the dog
dead and run through the body



At this moment a posse of people rushed in upon old Brisketone of
his daughters had had the sense to summon themand Dobbles head was
saved And when they saw the dog lying dead at my feet my ghastly
look my bloody sword they gave me no small credit for my bravery A
terrible fellow that Stubbs said they and so the mess said the next
day

I didnt tell them that the dog had committed SUICIDEwhy should I
And I didnt say a word about Dobbles cowardice I said he was a brave
fellow and fought like a tiger and this prevented HIM from telling
tales I had the dogskin made into a pair of pistolholsters and looked
so fierce and got such a name for courage in our regiment that when we
had to meet the regulars Bob Stubbs was always the man put forward to
support the honor of the corps The women you know adore courage and
such was my reputation at this time that I might have had my pick out
of half a dozen with three four or five thousand pounds apiece who
were dying for love of me and my red coat But I wasnt such a fool I
had been twice on the point of marriage and twice disappointed and
I vowed by all the Saints to have a wife and a rich one Depend upon
this as an infallible maxim to guide you through life ITS AS EASY TO
GET A RICH WIFE AS A POOR ONEthe same bait that will hook a fly will
hook a salmon




JULYSUMMARY PROCEEDINGS

Dobbles reputation for courage was not increased by the butchersdog
adventure but mine stood very high little Stubbs was voted the boldest
chap of all the bold North Bungays And though I must confess what was
proved by subsequent circumstances that nature has NOT endowed me with
a large or even I may say an average share of bravery yet a man is
very willing to flatter himself to the contrary and after a little
time I got to believe that my killing the dog was an action of
undaunted courage and that I was as gallant as any of the one hundred
thousand heroes of our army I always had a military tasteits only
the brutal part of the profession the horrid fighting and blood that I
dont like

I suppose the regiment was not very brave itselfbeing only militia
but certain it was that Stubbs was considered a most terrible fellow
and I swore so much and looked so fierce that you would have fancied
I had made half a hundred campaigns I was second in several duels the
umpire in all disputes and such a crackshot myself that fellows were
shy of insulting me As for Dobble I took him under my protection and
he became so attached to me that we ate drank and rode together every
day his father didnt care for money so long as his son was in good
companyand what so good as that of the celebrated Stubbs Heigho I
WAS good company in those days and a brave fellow too as I should have
remained but forwhat I shall tell the public immediately

It happened in the fatal year ninetysix that the brave North Bungays
were quartered at Portsmouth a maritime place which I need not
describe and which I wish I had never seen I might have been a General
now or at least a rich man

The redcoats carried everything before them in those days and I such
a crack character as I was in my regiment was very well received by
the townspeople many dinners I had many teaparties many lovely young
ladies did I lead down the pleasant countrydances

Well although I had had the two former rebuffs in love which I have
described my heart was still young and the fact was knowing that a
girl with a fortune was my only chance I made love here as furiously as
ever I shant describe the lovely creatures on whom I fixed whilst at
Portsmouth I tried more thanseveraland it is a singular fact which
I never have been able to account for that successful as I was with
ladies of maturer age by the young ones I was refused regular

But faint heart never won fair lady and so I went on and on until
I had got a Miss Clopper a tolerable rich navycontractors daughter
into such a way that I really dont think she could have refused me
Her brother Captain Clopper was in a line regiment and helped me as
much as ever he could he swore I was such a brave fellow

As I had received a number of attentions from Clopper I determined
to invite him to dinner which I could do without any sacrifice of my
principle upon this point for the fact is Dobble lived at an inn and
as he sent all his bills to his father I made no scruple to use his
table We dined in the coffeeroom Dobble bringing HIS friend and
so we made a party CARRY as the French say Some naval officers were
occupied in a similar way at a table next to ours

WellI didnt spare the bottle either for myself or for my friends
and we grew very talkative and very affectionate as the drinking went
on Each man told stories of his gallantry in the field or amongst the
ladies as officers will after dinner Clopper confided to the company
his wish that I should marry his sister and vowed that he thought me
the best fellow in Christendom

Ensign Dobble assented to this But let Miss Clopper beware says he
for Stubbs is a sad fellow he has had I dont know how many liaisons
already and he has been engaged to I dont know how many women

Indeed says Clopper Come Stubbs tell us your adventures

Psha said I modestly there is nothing indeed to tell I have
been in love my dear boywho has notand I have been jiltedwho has
not

Clopper swore he would blow his sisters brains out if ever SHE served
me so

Tell him about Miss Crutty said Dobble He he Stubbs served THAT
woman out anyhow she didnt jilt HIM Ill be sworn

Really Dobble you are too bad and should not mention names The
fact is the girl was desperately in love with me and had moneysixty
thousand pounds upon my reputation Well everything was arranged when
who should come down from London but a relation

Well and did he prevent the match

Prevent ityes sir I believe you he did though not in the sense
that YOU mean He would have given his eyesay and ten thousand pounds
moreif I would have accepted the girl but I would not

Why in the name of goodness

Sir her uncle was a SHOEMAKER I never would debase myself by marrying
into such a family

Of course not said Dobble he couldnt you know Well nowtell
him about the other girl Mary Waters you know

Hush Dobble hush dont you see one of those naval officers has
turned round and heard you My dear Clopper it was a mere childish
bagatelle

Well but lets have it said Clopperlets have it I wont tell my
sister you know And he put his hand to his nose and looked monstrous
wise

Nothing of that sort Clopperno nopon honorlittle Bob Stubbs is
no LIBERTINE and the story is very simple You see that my father has a
small place merely a few hundred acres at Sloffemsquiggle Isnt it
a funny name Hang it theres the naval gentleman staring againI
looked terribly fierce as I returned this officers stare and continued
in a loud careless voice Well at this Sloffemsquiggle there lived
a girl a Miss Waters the niece of some blackguard apothecary in the
neighborhood but my mother took a fancy to the girl and had her up to
the park and petted her We were both youngandandthe girl fell in
love with me thats the fact I was obliged to repel some rather warm
advances that she made me and here upon my honor as a gentleman you
have all the story about which that silly Dobble makes such a noise

Just as I finished this sentence I found myself suddenly taken by the
nose and a voice shouting out

Mr Stubbs you are A LIAR AND A SCOUNDREL Take this sirand this
for daring to meddle with the name of an innocent lady

I turned round as well as I couldfor the ruffian had pulled me out
of my chairand beheld a great marine monster six feet high who was
occupied in beating and kicking me in the most ungentlemanly manner
on my cheeks my ribs and between the tails of my coat He is a liar
gentlemen and a scoundrel The bootmaker had detected him in swindling
and so his niece refused him Miss Waters was engaged to him from
childhood and he deserted her for the bootmakers niece who was
richerAnd then sticking a card between my stock and my coatcollar
in what is called the scruff of my neck the disgusting brute gave me
another blow behind my back and left the coffeeroom with his friends

Dobble raised me up and taking the card from my neck read CAPTAIN
WATERS Clopper poured me out a glass of water and said in my ear If
this is true you are an infernal scoundrel Stubbs and must fight me
after Captain Waters and he flounced out of the room

I had but one course to pursue I sent the Captain a short and
contemptuous note saying that he was beneath my anger As for Clopper
I did not condescend to notice his remark but in order to get rid of the
troublesome society of these low blackguards I determined to gratify
an inclination I had long entertained and make a little tour I applied
for leave of absence and set off THAT VERY NIGHT I can fancy the
disappointment of the brutal Waters on coming as he did the next
morning to my quarters and finding me GONE Ha ha

After this adventure I became sick of a military lifeat least the life
of my own regiment where the officers such was their unaccountable
meanness and prejudice against me absolutely refused to see me at mess
Colonel Craw sent me a letter to this effect which I treated as it
deservedI never once alluded to it in any way and have since never
spoken a single word to any man in the North Bungays




AUGUSTDOGS HAVE THEIR DAYS

See now what life is I have had illluck on illluck from that day
to this I have sunk in the world and instead of riding my horse and
drinking my wine as a real gentleman should have hardly enough now to
buy a pint of ale ay and am very glad when anybody will treat me to
one Why why was I born to undergo such unmerited misfortunes

You must know that very soon after my adventure with Miss Crutty and
that cowardly ruffian Captain Waters he sailed the day after his
insult to me or I should most certainly have blown his brains out NOW
he is living in England and is my relation but of course I cut the
fellowvery soon after these painful events another happened which
ended too in a sad disappointment My dear papa died and instead of
leaving five thousand pounds as I expected at the very least left only
his estate which was worth but two The land and house were left to
me to mamma and my sisters he left to be sure a sum of two thousand
pounds in the hands of that eminent firm Messrs Pump Aldgate and Co
which failed within six months after his demise and paid in five years
about one shilling and ninepence in the pound which really was all my
dear mother and sisters had to live upon

The poor creatures were quite unused to money matters and would you
believe it when the news came of Pump and Aldgates failure mamma only
smiled and threw her eyes up to heaven and said Blessed be God that
we have still wherewithal to live There are tens of thousands in this
world dear children who would count our poverty riches And with this
she kissed my two sisters who began to blubber as girls always will
do and threw their arms round her neck and then round my neck until I
was half stifled with their embraces and slobbered all over with their
tears

Dearest mamma said I I am very glad to see the noble manner in
which you bear your loss and more still to know that you are so rich
as to be able to put up with it The fact was I really thought the
old lady had got a private hoard of her own as many of them havea
thousand pounds or so in a stocking Had she put by thirty pounds a
year as well she might for the thirty years of her marriage there
would have been nine hundred pounds clear and no mistake But still
I was angry to think that any such paltry concealment had been
practisedconcealment too of MY money so I turned on her pretty
sharply and continued my speech You say Maam that you are rich
and that Pump and Aldgates failure has no effect upon you I am very
happy to hear you say so Maamvery happy that you ARE rich and I
should like to know where your property my fathers property for
you had none of your ownI should like to know where this money
liesWHERE YOU HAVE CONCEALED IT Maam and permit me to say that
when I agreed to board you and my two sisters for eighty pounds a year
I did not know that you had OTHER resources than those mentioned in my
blessed fathers will

This I said to her because I hated the meanness of concealment not
because I lost by the bargain of boarding them for the three poor
things did not eat much more than sparrows and Ive often since
calculated that I had a clear twenty pounds a year profit out of them

Mamma and the girls looked quite astonished when I made the speech
What does he mean said Lucy to Eliza

Mamma repeated the question My beloved Robert what concealment are
you talking of

I am talking of concealed property Maam says I sternly

And do youwhatcan youdo you really suppose that I have
concealedany of that blessed saaaaints propopopoperty screams
out mamma Robert says sheBob my own darling boymy fondest
best beloved now HE is gone meaning my late governormore
tearsyou dont you cannot fancy that your own mother who bore you
and nursed you and wept for you and would give her all to save you
from a moments harmyou dont suppose that she would cheeeeat you
And here she gave a louder screech than ever and flung back on the
sofa and one of my sisters went and tumbled into her arms and tother
went round and the kissing and slobbering scene went on again only I
was left out thank goodness I hate such sentimentality

CHEEEEAT ME says I mocking her What do you mean then by
saying youre so rich Say have you got money or have you not And I
rapped out a good number of oaths too which I dont put in here but I
was in a dreadful fury thats the fact

So help me heaven says mamma in answer going down on her knees and
smacking her two hands I have but a Queen Annes guinea in the whole
of this wicked world

Then what Madam induces you to tell these absurd stories to me and
to talk about your riches when you know that you and your daughters are
beggars MaamBEGGARS

My dearest boy have we not got the house and the furniture and a
hundred a year still and have you not great talents which will make
all our fortunes says Mrs Stubbs getting up off her knees and
making believe to smile as she clawed hold of my hand and kissed it

This was TOO cool YOU have got a hundred a year Maam says IYOU
have got a house Upon my soul and honor this is the first I ever heard
of it and Ill tell you what Maam says I and it cut her PRETTY
SHARPLY too as youve got it YOUD BETTER GO AND LIVE IN IT Ive
got quite enough to do with my own house and every penny of my own
income

Upon this speech the old lady said nothing but she gave a screech loud
enough to be heard from here to York and down she fellkicking and
struggling in a regular fit



I did not see Mrs Stubbs for some days after this and the girls used
to come down to meals and never speak going up again and stopping with
their mother At last one day both of them came in very solemn to
my study and Eliza the eldest said Robert mamma has paid you our
board up to Michaelmas

She has says I for I always took precious good care to have it in
advance

She says Robert That on Michaelmas daywellwell go away
Robert

Oh shes going to her own house is she Lizzy Very good Shell want
the furniture I suppose and that she may have too for Im going to
sell the place myself And so THAT matter was settled



On Michaelmas dayand during these two months I hadnt I do believe
seen my mother twice once about two oclock in the morning I woke and
found her sobbing over my bedon Michaelmasday morning Eliza
comes to me and says ROBERT THEY WILL COME AND FETCH US AT SIX THIS
EVENING Well as this was the last day I went and got the best goose
I could find I dont think I ever saw a primer or ate more hearty
myself and had it roasted at three with a good pudding afterwards
and a glorious bowl of punch Heres a health to you dear girls says
I and you Ma and good luck to all three and as youve not eaten a
morsel I hope you wont object to a glass of punch Its the old stuff
you know Maam that that Waters sent to my father fifteen years ago

Six oclock came and with it came a fine barouche As I live Captain
Waters was on the box it was his coach that old thief Bates jumped
out entered my house and before I could say Jack Robinson whipped off
mamma to the carriage the girls followed just giving me a hasty shake
of the hand and as mamma was helped in Mary Waters who was sitting
inside flung her arms round her and then round the girls and the
Doctor who acted footman jumped on the box and off they went taking
no more notice of ME than if Id been a nonentity

Heres a picture of the whole businessMamma and Miss Waters are
sitting kissing each other in the carriage with the two girls in the
back seat Waters is driving a precious bad driver he is too and Im
standing at the garden door and whistling That old fool Mary Malowney
is crying behind the garden gate she went off next day along with the
furniture and I to get into that precious scrape which I shall mention
next




SEPTEMBERPLUCKING A GOOSE

After my papas death as he left me no money and only a little land
I put my estate into an auctioneers hands and determined to amuse
my solitude with a trip to some of our fashionable wateringplaces My
house was now a desert to me I need not say how the departure of my
dear parent and her children left me sad and lonely

Well I had a little ready money and for the estate expected a couple
of thousand pounds I had a good militarylooking person for though I
had absolutely cut the old North Bungays indeed after my affair with
Waters Colonel Craw hinted to me in the most friendly manner that
I had better resignthough I had left the army I still retained the
rank of Captain knowing the advantages attendant upon that title in a
wateringplace tour

Captain Stubbs became a great dandy at Cheltenham Harrogate Bath
Leamington and other places I was a good whist and billiard player
so much so that in many of these towns the people used to refuse at
last to play with me knowing how far I was their superior Fancy my
surprise about five years after the Portsmouth affair when strolling
one day up the High Street in Leamington my eyes lighted upon a young
man whom I remembered in a certain butchers yard and elsewhereno
other in fact than Dobble He too was dressed en militaire with
a frogged coat and spurs and was walking with a showylooking
Jewishfaced blackhaired lady glittering with chains and rings with
a green bonnet and a birdofParadisea lilac shawl a yellow gown
pink silk stockings and lightblue shoes Three children and a
handsome footman were walking behind her and the party not seeing me
entered the Royal Hotel together

I was known myself at the Royal and calling one of the waiters
learned the names of the lady and gentleman He was Captain Dobble the
son of the rich armyclothier Dobble Dobble Hobble and Co of Pall
Mallthe lady was a Mrs Manasseh widow of an American Jew living
quietly at Leamington with her children but possessed of an immense
property Theres no use to give ones self out to be an absolute
pauper so the fact is that I myself went everywhere with the character
of a man of very large means My father had died leaving me immense
sums of money and landed estates Ah I was the gentleman then the
real gentleman and everybody was too happy to have me at table

Well I came the next day and left a card for Dobble with a note He
neither returned my visit nor answered my note The day after however
I met him with the widow as before and going up to him very kindly
seized him by the hand and swore I wasas really was the casecharmed
to see him Dobble hung back to my surprise and I do believe the
creature would have cut me if he dared but I gave him a frown and
said

What Dobble my boy dont you recollect old Stubbs and our adventure
with the butchers daughtersha

Dobble gave a sickly kind of grin and said Oh ah yes It isyes
it is I believe Captain Stubbs

An old comrade Madam of Captain Dobbles and one who has heard so
much and seen so much of your ladyship that he must take the liberty
of begging his friend to introduce him

Dobble was obliged to take the hint and Captain Stubbs was duly
presented to Mrs Manasseh The lady was as gracious as possible and
when at the end of the walk we parted she said she hoped Captain
Dobble would bring me to her apartments that evening where she expected
a few friends Everybody you see knows everybody at Leamington and
I for my part was well known as a retired officer of the army who
on his fathers death had come into seven thousand a year Dobbles
arrival had been subsequent to mine but putting up as he did at the
Royal Hotel and dining at the ordinary there with the widow he had
made her acquaintance before I had I saw however that if I allowed
him to talk about me as he could I should be compelled to give up all
my hopes and pleasures at Leamington and so I determined to be short
with him As soon as the lady had gone into the hotel my friend Dobble
was for leaving me likewise but I stopped him and said Mr Dobble I
saw what you meant just now you wanted to cut me because forsooth I
did not choose to fight a duel at Portsmouth Now look you Dobble I
am no hero but Im not such a coward as youand you know it You are
a very different man to deal with from Waters and I WILL FIGHT this
time

Not perhaps that I would but after the business of the butcher I knew
Dobble to be as great a coward as ever lived and there never was any
harm in threatening for you know you are not obliged to stick to it
afterwards My words had their effect upon Dobble who stuttered and
looked red and then declared he never had the slightest intention of
passing me by so we became friends and his mouth was stopped

He was very thick with the widow but that lady had a very capacious
heart and there were a number of other gentlemen who seemed equally
smitten with her Look at that Mrs Manasseh said a gentleman it
was droll HE was a Jew too sitting at dinner by me She is old
and ugly and yet because she has money all the men are flinging
themselves at her

She has money has she

Eighty thousand pounds and twenty thousand for each of her children
I know it FOR A FACT said the strange gentleman I am in the law
and we of our faith you know know pretty well what the great families
amongst us are worth

Who was Mr Manasseh said I

A man of enormous wealtha tobaccomerchantWest Indies a fellow of
no birth however and who between ourselves married a woman that is
not much better than she should be My dear sir whispered he she
is always in love Now it is with that Captain Dobble last week it was
somebody elseand it may be you next week ifha ha hayou are
disposed to enter the lists I wouldnt for MY part have the woman
with twice her money

What did it matter to me whether the woman was good or not provided
she was rich My course was quite clear I told Dobble all that this
gentleman had informed me and being a pretty good hand at making a
story I made the widow appear SO bad that the poor fellow was quite
frightened and fairly quitted the field Ha ha Im dashed if I did
not make him believe that Mrs Manasseh had MURDERED her last husband

I played my game so well thanks to the information that my friend the
lawyer had given me that in a month I had got the widow to show a most
decided partiality for me I sat by her at dinner I drank with her
at the WellsI rode with her I danced with her and at a picnic to
Kenilworth where we drank a good deal of champagne I actually popped
the question and was accepted In another month Robert Stubbs Esq
led to the altar Leah widow of the late Z Manasseh Esq of St
Kitts



We drove up to London in her comfortable chariot the children and
servants following in a postchaise I paid of course for everything
and until our house in Berkeley Square was painted we stopped at
Stevenss Hotel



My own estate had been sold and the money was lying at a bank in the
City About three days after our arrival as we took our breakfast in
the hotel previous to a visit to Mrs Stubbss banker where certain
little transfers were to be made a gentleman was introduced who I saw
at a glance was of my wifes persuasion

He looked at Mrs Stubbs and made a bow Perhaps it will be convenient
to you to pay this little bill one hundred and fiftytwo pounds

My love says she will you pay thisit is a trifle which I had
really forgotten

My soul said I I have really not the money in the house

Vel denn Captain Shtubbsh says he I must do my dutyand arrest
youhere is the writ Tom keep the door My wife faintedthe
children screamed and I fancy my condition as I was obliged to march
off to a spunginghouse along with a horrid sheriffs officer




OCTOBERMARS AND VENUS IN OPPOSITION

I shall not describe my feelings when I found myself in a cage in
Cursitor Street instead of that fine house in Berkeley Square which
was to have been mine as the husband of Mrs Manasseh What a placein
an odious dismal street leading from Chancery Lane A hideous Jew boy
opened the second of three doors and shut it when Mr Nabb and I almost
fainting had entered then he opened the third door and then I was
introduced to a filthy place called a coffeeroom which I exchanged for
the solitary comfort of a little dingy backparlor where I was left for
a while to brood over my miserable fate Fancy the change between this
and Berkeley Square Was I after all my pains and cleverness and
perseverance cheated at last Had this Mrs Manasseh been imposing
upon me and were the words of the wretch I met at the tabledhote at
Leamington only meant to mislead me and take me in I determined to send
for my wife and know the whole truth I saw at once that I had been the
victim of an infernal plot and that the carriage the house in town
the West India fortune were only so many lies which I had blindly
believed It was true that the debt was but a hundred and fifty pounds
and I had two thousand at my bankers But was the loss of HER 80000L
nothing Was the destruction of my hopes nothing The accursed addition
to my family of a Jewish wife and three Jewish children nothing And
all these I was to support out of my two thousand pounds I had better
have stopped at home with my mamma and sisters whom I really did love
and who produced me eighty pounds a year

I had a furious interview with Mrs Stubbs and when I charged her the
base wretch with cheating me like a brazen serpent as she was she
flung back the cheat in my teeth and swore I had swindled her Why did
I marry her when she might have had twenty others She only took me
she said because I had twenty thousand pounds I HAD said I possessed
that sum but in love you know and war alls fair

We parted quite as angrily as we met and I cordially vowed that when I
had paid the debt into which I had been swindled by her I would take
my 2000L and depart to some desert island or at the very least to
America and never see her more or any of her Israelitish brood There
was no use in remaining in the spunginghouse for I knew that there
were such things as detainers and that where Mrs Stubbs owed a hundred
pounds she might owe a thousand so I sent for Mr Nabb and tendering
him a cheque for 150L and his costs requested to be let out forthwith
Here fellow said I is a cheque on Childs for your paltry sum

It may be a sheck on Shilds says Mr Nabb but I should be a baby
to let you out on such a paper as dat

Well said I Childs is but a step from this you may go and get the
cashjust give me an acknowledgment

Nabb drew out the acknowledgment with great punctuality and set off
for the bankers whilst I prepared myself for departure from this
abominable prison

He smiled as he came in Well said I you have touched your money
and now I must tell you that you are the most infernal rogue and
extortioner I ever met with

Oh no Mishter Shtubbsh says he grinning still Dere is som
greater roag dan memosh greater

Fellow said I dont stand grinning before a gentleman but give me
my hat and cloak and let me leave your filthy den

Shtop Shtubbsh says he not even Mistering me this time Here ish a
letter vich you had better read

I opened the letter something fell to the groundit was my cheque

The letter ran thus Messrs Child and Co present their compliments to
Captain Stubbs and regret that they have been obliged to refuse payment
of the enclosed having been served this day with an attachment by
Messrs Solomonson and Co which compels them to retain Captain Stubbs
balance of 2010L 11s 6d until the decision of the suit of Solomonson
v Stubbs

FLEET STREET

You see says Mr Nabb as I read this dreadful letteryou see
Shtubbsh dere vas two debtsa little von and a big von So dey
arrested you for de little von and attashed your money for de big von

Dont laugh at me for telling this story If you knew what tears are
blotting over the paper as I write itif you knew that for weeks after
I was more like a madman than a sane mana madman in the Fleet Prison
where I went instead of to the desert island What had I done to deserve
it Hadnt I always kept an eye to the main chance Hadnt I lived
economically and not like other young men Had I ever been known to
squander or give away a single penny No I can lay my hand on my heart
and thank heaven say No Why why was I punished so

Let me conclude this miserable history Seven monthsmy wife saw me
once or twice and then dropped me altogetherI remained in that fatal
place I wrote to my dear mamma begging her to sell her furniture but
got no answer All my old friends turned their backs upon me My action
went against meI had not a penny to defend it Solomonson proved my
wifes debt and seized my two thousand pounds As for the detainer
against me I was obliged to go through the court for the relief of
insolvent debtors I passed through it and came out a beggar But
fancy the malice of that wicked Stiffelkind he appeared in court as my
creditor for 3L with sixteen years interest at five per cent for a
PAIR OF TOPBOOTS The old thief produced them in court and told the
whole storyLord Cornwallis the detection the pumping and all

Commissioner Dubobwig was very funny about it So Doctor Swishtail
would not pay you for the boots eh Mr Stiffelkind

No he said ven I asked him for payment dey was ordered by a yong
boy and I ought to have gone to his schoolmaster

What then you came on a BOOTLESS errand ay sir A laugh

Bootless no sare I brought de boots back vid me How de devil else
could I show dem to you Another laugh

Youve never SOLED em since Mr Tickleshins

I never would sell dem I svore I never vood on porpus to be revenged
on dat Stobbs

What your wound has never been HEALED eh

Vat do you mean vid your bootless errands and your soling and healing
I tell you I have done vat I svore to do I have exposed him at school
I have broak off a marriage for him ven he vould have had tventy
tousand pound and now I have showed him up in a court of justice Dat
is vat I ave done and dats enough And then the old wretch went
down whilst everybody was giggling and staring at poor meas if I was
not miserable enough already

This seems the dearest pair of boots you ever had in your life Mr
Stubbs said Commissioner Dubobwig very archly and then he began to
inquire about the rest of my misfortunes

In the fulness of my heart I told him the whole of them how Mr
Solomonson the attorney had introduced me to the rich widow Mrs
Manasseh who had fifty thousand pounds and an estate in the West
Indies How I was married and arrested on coming to town and cast
in an action for two thousand pounds brought against me by this very
Solomonson for my wifes debts

Stop says a lawyer in the court Is this woman a showy blackhaired
woman with one eye very often drunk with three childrenSolomonson
short with red hair

Exactly so said I with tears in my eyes

That woman has married THREE MEN within the last two years One in
Ireland and one at Bath A Solomonson is I believe her husband and
they both are off for America ten days ago

But why did you not keep your 2000L said the lawyer

Sir they attached it

Oh well we may pass you You have been unlucky Mr Stubbs but it
seems as if the biter had been bit in this affair

No said Mr Dubobwig Mr Stubbs is the victim of a FATAL
ATTACHMENT




NOVEMBERA GENERAL POST DELIVERY

I was a free man when I went out of the Court but I was a beggarI
Captain Stubbs of the bold North Bungays did not know where I could
get a bed or a dinner

As I was marching sadly down Portugal Street I felt a hand on my
shoulder and a rough voice which I knew well

Vell Mr Stobbs have I not kept my promise I told you dem boots
would be your ruin

I was much too miserable to reply and only cast my eyes towards the
roofs of the houses which I could not see for the tears

Vat you begin to gry and blobber like a shild you vood marry vood
you and noting vood do for you but a vife vid monnyha habut you
vere de pigeon and she was de grow She has plocked you too pretty
velleh ha ha

Oh Mr Stiffelkind said I dont laugh at my misery she has not
left me a single shilling under heaven And I shall starve I do believe
I shall starve And I began to cry fit to break my heart

Starf stoff and nonsense You vill never die of starfingyou vill die
of HANGING I tinkho hoand it is moch easier vay too I didnt
say a word but cried on till everybody in the street turned round and
stared

Come come said Stiffelkind do not gry Gaptain Stobbsit is not
goot for a Gaptain to gryha ha Derecome vid me and you shall have
a dinner and a bregfast toovich shall gost you nothing until you
can bay vid your earnings

And so this curious old man who had persecuted me all through my
prosperity grew compassionate towards me in my illluck and took me
home with him as he promised I saw your name among de Insolvents and
I vowed you know to make you repent dem boots Dere now it is done
and forgotten look you Here Betty Bettchen make de spare bed and
put a clean knife and fork Lort Cornvallis is come to dine vid me

I lived with this strange old man for six weeks I kept his books and
did what little I could to make myself useful carrying about boots and
shoes as if I had never borne his Majestys commission He gave me no
money but he fed and lodged me comfortably The men and boys used
to laugh and call me General and Lord Cornwallis and all sorts of
nicknames and old Stiffelkind made a thousand new ones for me

One day I can recollectone miserable day as I was polishing on
the trees a pair of boots of Mr Stiffelkinds manufacturethe old
gentleman came into the shop with a lady on his arm

Vere is Gaptain Stobbs said he Vere is dat ornament to his
Majestys service

I came in from the back shop where I was polishing the boots with one
of them in my hand

Look my dear says he here is an old friend of yours his
Excellency Lort CornvallisWho would have thought such a nobleman
vood turn shoeblack Captain Stobbs here is your former flame my dear
niece Miss Grotty How could you Magdalen ever leaf such a lof of a
man Shake hands vid her Gaptaindere never mind de blacking But
Miss drew back

I never shake hands with a SHOEBLACK said she mighty contemptuous

Bah my lof his fingers vont soil you Dont you know he has just
been VITEVASHED

I wish uncle says she you would not leave me with such low
people

Low because he cleans boots De Gaptain prefers PUMPS to boots I
tinkha ha

Captain indeed a nice Captain says Miss Crutty snapping her fingers
in my face and walking away a Captain who has had his nose pulled
ha haAnd how could I help it it wasnt by my own CHOICE that that
ruffian Waters took such liberties with me Didnt I show how averse I
was to all quarrels by refusing altogether his challengeBut such is
the world And thus the people at Stiffelkinds used to tease me until
they drove me almost mad

At last he came home one day more merry and abusive than ever
Gaptain says he I have goot news for youa goot place Your
lordship vill not be able to geep your garridge but you vill be
gomfortable and serve his Majesty

Serve his Majesty says I Dearest Mr Stiffelkind have you got me a
place under Government

Yes and somting better stillnot only a place but a uniform yes
Gaptain Stobbs a RED GOAT

A red coat I hope you dont think I would demean myself by entering
the ranks of the army I am a gentleman Mr StiffelkindI can
neverno I never

No I know you will neveryou are too great a gowardha hathough
dis is a red goat and a place where you must give some HARD KNOCKS
tooha hado you gomprehendand you shall be a general instead of
a gaptainha ha

A general in a red coat Mr Stiffelkind

Yes a GENERAL BOSTMANha ha I have been vid your old friend
Bunting and he has an uncle in the Post Office and he has got you de
placeeighteen shillings a veek you rogue and your goat You must not
oben any of de letters you know

And so it wasI Robert Stubbs Esquire became the vile thing he
nameda general postman



I was so disgusted with Stiffelkinds brutal jokes which were now more
brutal than ever that when I got my place in the Post Office I never
went near the fellow again for though he had done me a favor in
keeping me from starvation he certainly had done it in a very rude
disagreeable manner and showed a low and mean spirit in SHOVING me
into such a degraded place as that of postman But what had I to do I
submitted to fate and for three years or more Robert Stubbs of the
North Bungay Fencibles was

I wonder nobody recognized me I lived in daily fear the first year but
afterwards grew accustomed to my situation as all great men will do
and wore my red coat as naturally as if I had been sent into the world
only for the purpose of being a lettercarrier

I was first in the Whitechapel district where I stayed for nearly three
years when I was transferred to Jermyn Street and Duke Streetfamous
places for lodgings I suppose I left a hundred letters at a house in
the latter street where lived some people who must have recognized me
had they but once chanced to look at me

You see that when I left Sloffemsquiggle and set out in the gay world
my mamma had written to me a dozen times at least but I never answered
her for I knew she wanted money and I detest writing Well she
stopped her letters finding she could get none from mebut when I was
in the Fleet as I told you I wrote repeatedly to my dear mamma and
was not a little nettled at her refusing to notice me in my distress
which is the very time one most wants notice

Stubbs is not an uncommon name and though I saw MRS STUBBS on a little
bright brass plate in Duke street and delivered so many letters to the
lodgers in her house I never thought of asking who she was or whether
she was my relation or not

One day the young woman who took in the letters had not got change and
she called her mistress An old lady in a pokebonnet came out of the
parlor and put on her spectacles and looked at the letter and fumbled
in her pocket for eightpence and apologized to the postman for keeping
him waiting And when I said Never mind Maam its no trouble
the old lady gave a start and then she pulled off her spectacles and
staggered back and then she began muttering as if about to choke
and then she gave a great screech and flung herself into my arms and
roared out MY SON MY SON

Law mamma said I is that you and I sat down on the hall bench
with her and let her kiss me as much as ever she liked Hearing the
whining and crying down comes another lady from up stairsit was my
sister Eliza and down come the lodgers And the maid gets water and
what not and I was the regular hero of the group I could not stay
long then having my letters to deliver But in the evening after
mailtime I went back to my mamma and sister and over a bottle of
prime old port and a precious good leg of boiled mutton and turnips
made myself pretty comfortable I can tell you




DECEMBERTHE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT

Mamma had kept the house in Duke Street for more than two years I
recollected some of the chairs and tables from dear old Sloffemsquiggle
and the bowl in which I had made that famous rumpunch the evening she
went away which she and my sisters left untouched and I was obliged to
drink after they were gone but thats not to the purpose

Think of my sister Lucys luck that chap Waters fell in love with
her and married her and she now keeps her carriage and lives in state
near Sloffemsquiggle I offered to make it up with Waters but he bears
malice and never will see or speak to meHe had the impudence too
to say that he took in all letters for mamma at Sloffemsquiggle and
that as mine were all beggingletters he burned them and never said a
word to her concerning them He allowed mamma fifty pounds a year and
if she were not such a fool she might have had three times as much but
the old lady was high and mighty forsooth and would not be beholden
even to her own daughter for more than she actually wanted Even this
fifty pound she was going to refuse but when I came to live with her
of course I wanted pocketmoney as well as board and lodging and so
I had the fifty pounds for MY share and eked out with it as well as I
could

Old Bates and the Captain between them gave mamma a hundred pounds
when she left me she had the deuces own luck to be suremuch more
than ever fell to ME I know and as she said she WOULD try and work for
her living it was thought best to take a house and let lodgings which
she did Our first and second floor paid us four guineas a week on an
average and the front parlor and attic made forty pounds more Mamma
and Eliza used to have the front attic but I took that and they slept
in the servants bedroom Lizzy had a pretty genius for work and earned
a guinea a week that way so that we had got nearly two hundred a year
over the rent to keep house withand we got on pretty well Besides
women eat nothing my women didnt care for meat for days together
sometimesso that it was only necessary to dress a good steak or so
for me

Mamma would not think of my continuing in the Post Office She said
her dear Robert her husbands son her gallant soldier and all that
should remain at home and be a gentlemanwhich I was certainly though
I didnt find fifty pounds a year very much to buy clothes and be a
gentleman upon To be sure mother found me shirts and linen so that
THAT wasnt in the fifty pounds She kicked a little at paying the
washing too but she gave in at last for I was her dear Bob you know
and Im blest if I could not make her give me the gown off her back
Fancy once she cut up a very nice rich black silk scarf which my
sister Waters sent her and made me a waistcoat and two stocks of it
She was so VERY soft the old lady



Id lived in this way for five years or more making myself content
with my fifty pounds a year PERHAPS I had saved a little out of it but
thats neither here nor there From years end to years end I remained
faithful to my dear mamma never leaving her except for a month or so
in the summerwhen a bachelor may take a trip to Gravesend or Margate
which would be too expensive for a family I say a bachelor for the
fact is I dont know whether I am married or notnever having heard a
word since of the scoundrelly Mrs Stubbs

I never went to the publichouse before meals for with my beggarly
fifty pounds I could not afford to dine away from home but there I had
my regular seat and used to come home PRETTY GLORIOUS I can tell you
Then bed till eleven then breakfast and the newspaper then a stroll in
Hyde Park or St Jamess then home at halfpast three to dinnerwhen
I jollied as I call it for the rest of the day I was my mothers
delight and thus with a clear conscience I managed to live on



How fond she was of me to be sure Being sociable myself and loving
to have my friends about me we often used to assemble a company of as
hearty fellows as you would wish to sit down with and keep the nights
up royally Never mind my boys I used to say Send the bottle
round mammy pays for all As she did sure enough and sure enough we
punished her cellar too The good old lady used to wait upon us as
if for all the world she had been my servant instead of a lady and my
mamma Never used she to repine though I often as I must confess gave
her occasion keeping her up till four oclock in the morning because
she never could sleep until she saw her dear Bob in bed and leading
her a sad anxious life She was of such a sweet temper the old lady
that I think in the course of five years I never knew her in a passion
except twice and then with sister Lizzy who declared I was ruining
the house and driving the lodgers away one by one But mamma would
not hear of such envious spite on my sisters part Her Bob was
always right she said At last Lizzy fairly retreated and went to the
WaterssI was glad of it for her temper was dreadful and we used to
be squabbling from morning till night

Ah those WERE jolly times but Ma was obliged to give up the
lodginghouse at lastfor somehow things went wrong after my sisters
departurethe nasty uncharitable people said on account of ME because
I drove away the lodgers by smoking and drinking and kicking up noises
in the house and because Ma gave me so much of her moneyso she did
but if she WOULD give it you know how could I help it Heigho I wish
Id KEPT it

No such luck The business I thought was to last for ever but at the
end of two years came a smashshut up shopsell off everything Mamma
went to the Waterss and will you believe it the ungrateful wretches
would not receive me that Mary you see was SO disappointed at not
marrying me Twenty pounds a year they allow it is true but whats
that for a gentleman For twenty years I have been struggling manfully
to gain an honest livelihood and in the course of them have seen a
deal of life to be sure Ive sold cigars and pockethandkerchiefs
at the corners of streets Ive been a billiardmarker Ive been a
director in the panic year of the Imperial British Consolidated Mangle
and Drying Ground Company Ive been on the stage for two years as an
actor and about a month as a cad when I was very low Ive been
the means of giving to the police of this empire some very valuable
information about licensed victuallers gentlemens carts and
pawnbrokers names Ive been very nearly an officer againthat is
an assistant to an officer of the Sheriff of Middlesex it was my last
place

On the last day of the year 1837 even THAT game was up Its a
thing that very seldom happened to a gentleman to be kicked out of
a spunginghouse but such was my case Young Nabb who succeeded his
father drove me ignominiously from his door because I had charged a
gentleman in the coffeerooms sevenandsixpence for a glass of ale and
bread and cheese the charge of the house being only six shillings He
had the meanness to deduct the eighteenpence from my wages and because
I blustered a bit he took me by the shoulders and turned me outme a
gentleman and what is more a poor orphan

How I did rage and swear at him when I got out into the street There
stood he the hideous Jew monster at the double door writhing under
the effect of my language I had my revenge Heads were thrust out of
every bar of his windows laughing at him A crowd gathered round me
as I stood pounding him with my satire and they evidently enjoyed his
discomfiture I think the mob would have pelted the ruffian to death
one or two of their missiles hit ME I can tell you when a policeman
came up and in reply to a gentleman who was asking what was the
disturbance said Bless you sir its Lord Cornwallis Move on
BOOTS said the fellow to me for the fact is my misfortunes and early
life are pretty well knownand so the crowd dispersed

What could have made that policeman call you Lord Cornwallis and
Boots said the gentleman who seemed mightily amused and had followed
me Sir says I I am an unfortunate officer of the North Bungay
Fencibles and Ill tell you willingly for a pint of beer He told me
to follow him to his chambers in the Temple which I did a fivepair
back and there sure enough I had the beer and told him this very
story youve been reading You see he is what is called a literary
manand sold my adventures for me to the booksellers hes a strange
chap and says theyre MORAL



Im blest if I can see anything moral in them Im sure I ought to have
been more lucky through life being so very wide awake And yet here I
am without a place or even a friend starving upon a beggarly twenty
pounds a yearnot a single sixpence more upon MY HONOR
