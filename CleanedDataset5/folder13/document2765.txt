THE LADY FROM THE SEA




ACT I

SCENEDOCTOR WANGELS house with a large verandah garden in front of
and around the house Under the verandah a flagstaff In the garden
an arbour with table and chairs Hedge with small gate at the back
Beyond a road along the seashore An avenue of trees along the road
Between the trees are seen the fjord high mountain ranges and peaks A
warm and brilliantly clear summer morning

BALLESTED middleaged wearing an old velvet jacket and a
broadbrimmed artists hat stands under the flagstaff arranging the
ropes The flag is lying on the ground A little way from him is an
easel with an outspread canvas By the easel on a campstool brushes
a palette and box of colours

BOLETTE WANGEL comes from the room opening on the verandah She carries
a large vase with flowers which she puts down on the table

Bolette Well Ballested does it work smoothly

Ballested Certainly Miss Bolette thats easy enough May I askdo
you expect any visitors today

Bolette Yes were expecting Mr Arnholm this morning He got to town
in the night

Ballested Arnholm Wait a minutewasnt Arnholm the man who was tutor
here several years ago

Bolette Yes it is he

Ballested Oh really Is he coming into these parts again

Bolette Thats why we want to have the flag up

Ballested Well thats reasonable enough

BOLETTE goes into the room again A little after LYNGSTRAND enters from
the road and stands still interested by the easel and painting gear He
is a slender youth poorly but carefully dressed and looks delicate

Lyngstrand on the other side of the hedge Goodmorning

Ballested turning round Hallo Goodmorning Hoists up flag Thats
it Up goes the balloon Fastens the ropes and then busies himself
about the easel Goodmorning my dear sir I really dont think Ive
the pleasure ofLyngstrand Im sure youre a painter

Ballested Of course I am Why shouldnt I be

Lyngstrand Yes I can see you are May I take the liberty of coming in
a moment

Ballested Would you like to come in and see

Lyngstrand I should like to immensely

Ballested Oh theres nothing much to see yet But come in Come a
little closer

Lyngstrand Many thanks Comes in through the garden gate

Ballested painting Its the fjord there between the islands Im
working at

Lyngstrand So I see

Ballested But the figure is still wanting Theres not a model to be
got in this town

Lyngstrand Is there to be a figure too

Ballested Yes Here by the rocks in the foreground a mermaid is to lie
halfdead

Lyngstrand Why is she to be halfdead

Ballested She has wandered hither from the sea and cant find her way
out again And so you see she lies there dying in the brackish water

Lyngstrand Ah I see

Ballested The mistress of this house put it into my head to do
something of the kind

Lyngstrand What shall you call the picture when its finished

Ballested I think of calling it The Mermaids End

Lyngstrand Thats capital Youre sure to make something fine of it

Ballested looking at him In the profession too perhaps

Lyngstrand Do you mean a painter

Ballested Yes

Lyngstrand No Im not that but Im going to be a sculptor My name is
Hans Lyngstrand

Ballested So youre to be a sculptor Yes yes the art of sculpture is
a nice pretty art in its way I fancy Ive seen you in the street once
or twice Have you been staying here long

Lyngstrand No Ive only been here a fortnight But I shall try to stop
till the end of the summer

Ballested For the bathing

Lyngstrand Yes I wanted to see if I could get a little stronger

Ballested Not delicate surely

Lyngstrand Yes perhaps I am a little delicate but its nothing
dangerous Just a little tightness on the chest

Ballested Tusha bagatelle You should consult a good doctor

Lyngstrand Yes I thought of speaking to Doctor Wangel one of these
times

Ballested You should Looks out to the left Theres another steamer
crowded with passengers Its really marvellous how travelling has
increased here of late years

Lyngstrand Yes theres a good deal of traffic here I think

Ballested And lots of summer visitors come here too I often hear our
good town will lose its individuality with all these foreign goings on

Lyngstrand Were you born in the town

Ballested No but I have acclaacclimatised myself I feel united to
the place by the bonds of time and habit

Lyngstrand Then youve lived here a long time

Ballested Wellabout seventeen or eighteen years I came here with
Skives Dramatic Company But then we got into difficulties and so the
company broke up and dispersed in all directions

Lyngstrand But you yourself remained here

Ballested I remained and Ive done very well I was then working
chiefly as decorative artist dont you know

BOLETTE comes out with a rockingchair which she places on the
verandah

Bolette speaking into the room Hilde see if you can find the
embroidered footstool for father

Lyngstrand going up to the verandah bows Goodmorning Miss Wangel

Bolette by the balustrade What Is it you Mr Lyngstrand
Goodmorning Excuse me one moment Im onlyGoes into room

Ballested Do you know the family

Lyngstrand Not well Ive only met the young ladies now and again in
company and I had a chat with Mrs Wangel the last time we had music up
at the View She said I might come and see them

Ballested Now do you know you ought to cultivate their acquaintance

Lyngstrand Yes Id been thinking of paying a visit Just a sort of
call If only I could find some excuse

Ballested Excuse Nonsense Looking out to the left Damn it
Gathering his things The steamers by the pier already I must get
off to the hotel Perhaps some of the new arrivals may want me For Im
a hairdresser too dont you know

Lyngstrand You are certainly very manysided sir

Ballested In small towns one has to try to acclamacclimatise Oneself
in various branches If you should require anything in the hair linea
little pomatum or such likeyouve only to ask for Dancingmaster
Ballested

Lyngstrand Dancing master

Ballested President of the Wind Band Society by your leave Weve a
concert on this evening up at the View Goodbye goodbye

He goes out with his painting gear through the garden gate

HILDE comes out with the footstool BOLETTE brings more flowers
LYNGSTRAND bows to HILDE from the garden below

Hilde by the balustrade not returning his bow Bolette said you had
ventured in today

Lyngstrand Yes I took the liberty of coming in for a moment

Hilde Have you been out for a morning walk

Lyngstrand Oh no nothing came of the walk this morning

Hilde Have you been bathing then

Lyngstrand Yes Ive been in the water a little while I saw your
mother down there She was going into her bathingmachine

Hilde Who was

Lyngstrand Your mother

Hilde Oh I see She puts the stool in front of the rockingchair

Bolette interrupting Didnt you see anything of fathers boat out on
the fjord

Lyngstrand Yes I thought I saw a sailingboat that was steering
inland

Bolette Im sure that was father Hes been to visit patients on the
islands She is arranging things on the table

Lyngstrand taking a step up the stairs to the verandah Why how
everythings decorated here with flowers

Bolette Yes doesnt it look nice

Lyngstrand It looks lovely It looks as if it were some festival day in
the house

Hilde Thats exactly what it is

Lyngstrand I might have guessed it Im sure its your fathers
birthday

Bolette warningly to HILDE Hmhm

Hilde taking no notice of her No mothers

Lyngstrand Oh Your mothers

Bolette in low voice angrily Really Hilde

Hilde the same Let me be To LYNGSTRAND I suppose youre going
home to breakfast now

Lyngstrand going down steps Yes I suppose I must go and get
something to eat

Hilde Im sure you find the living very good at the hotel

Lyngstrand Im not staying at the hotel now It was too expensive for
me

Hilde Where are you staying then

Lyngstrand Im staying up at Mrs Jensens

Hilde What Mrs Jensens

Lyngstrand The midwife

Hilde Excuse me Mr Lyngstrand but I really have other matters to
attend to Lyngstrand Oh Im sure I ought not to have said that

Hilde Said what

Lyngstrand What I said

Hilde looking contemptuously at him I dont understand you in the
least

Lyngstrand No no But I must say goodbye for the present

Bolette comes forward to the steps Goodbye goodbye Mr
Lyngstrand You must excuse us now But another daywhen youve plenty
of timeand inclinationyou really must come in and see father and the
rest of us

Lyngstrand Yes thanks very much I shall be delighted Bows and
goes out through the garden gate As he goes along the road he bows
again towards the verandah

Hilde in low voice Adieu Monsieur Please remember me to Mother
Jensen

Bolette in a low voice shaking her arm Hilde You naughty child Are
you quite crazy He might have heard you

Hilde Pshaw Do you think I care about that

Bolette looking out to the right Heres father

WANGEL in travelling dress and carrying a small bag comes from the
footpath

Wangel See Im back again little girls He enters through the garden
gate

Bolette going towards him at the bottom of the garden Oh It is
delightful that youve come

Hilde also going up to him Now have you got off for the whole day
father

Wangel Oh no I must go down to the office for a little while
presently I saydo you know if Arnholm has come

Bolette Yes he arrived in the night We sent to the hotel to enquire

Wangel Then youve not seen him yet

Bolette No but hes sure to come here this morning

Wangel Yes hes sure to do that

Hilde pulling him Father now you must look round

Wangel looking towards the verandah Yes I see well enough child
Its quite festive

Bolette Now dont you think weve arranged it nicely

Wangel I must say you have Areare we alone at home now

Hilde Yes shes gone to

Bolette interrupting quickly Mother has gone to bathe

Wangel looks lovingly at BOLETTE and pats her head Then he says
hesitating Look here little ones Do you want to keep this up all
day And the flag hoisted too

Hilde Surely you understand that father

Wangel Hm Yes but you see

Bolette looks at him and nods Surely you can understand weve been
doing all this in honour of Mr Arnholm When such a good friend comes
to see you for the first time

Hilde smiling and shaking him Think he who used to be Bolettes
tutor father

Wangel with a halfsmile Youre a pair of sly minxes Wellgood
heavensafter all its but natural we should remember her who is no
more with us Here Hilde Gives her his bag take that down to the
office No children I dont like thisthe way I mean This habit of
every yearwellwhat can one say I suppose it cant be managed any
other way

Hilde about to go out of garden and with the bag stops short turns
and points out Look at that gentleman coming up here Im sure its
your tutor

Bolette looks in that direction He Laughs That is good Do you
think that middleaged fellow is Arnholm

Wangel Wait a moment child Why by Jove I do believe it is he Yes
it certainly is

Bolette staring at him in quiet amazement Yes I almost think

ARNHOLM in elegant morning dress with gold spectacles and a thin
cane comes along the road He looks overworked He looks in at the
garden bows in friendly fashion and enters by the garden gate

Wangel going to meet him Welcome dear Arnholm Heartily welcome back
to your old quarters again

Arnholm Thanks thanks Doctor Wangel A thousand thanks They shake
hands and walk up the garden together And there are the children
Holds out his hands and looks at them I should hardly have known
these two again

Wangel No I believe you

Arnholm And yetperhaps Boletteyes I should have known Bolette
again

Wangel Hardly I think Why it is eightnine years since you saw her
Ah yes Many a thing has changed here meanwhile

Arnholm looking round I really dont see it except that the trees
have grown remarkably and that youve set up that arbour

Wangel Oh nooutwardly

Arnholm smiling And then of course youve two grownup daughters
here now

Wangel Grown up Well theres only one grown up

Hilde aside Just listen to father

Wangel But now lets sit down up there on the verandah Its cooler
than here Wont you

Arnholm Thanks thanks dear doctor

They go up WANGEL motions him to the rockingchair

Wangel Thats right Now make yourself comfortable and rest for you
seem rather tired after your journey

Arnholm Oh thats nothing Here amid these surroundings Bolette to
WANGEL Hadnt we better have some soda and syrup in the sittingroom
Its sure to be too hot out here soon

Wangel Yes girls Lets have some soda and syrup and perhaps a drop
of Cognac too

Bolette Cognac too

Wangel Just a little in case anyone should like some

Bolette All right Hilde go down to the office with the bag

BOLETTE goes into the room and closes the door after her

HILDE takes the bag and goes through the garden to the back of the
house

Arnholm who has followed BOLETTE with his eyes What a splendid
They are both splendid girls whove grown up here for you

Wangel sitting down Yes you think so too

Arnholm Why its simply amazing how Boletteand Hilde too But
now you yourself dear doctor Do you think of staying here all your
life

Wangel Yes I suppose so Why Ive been born and bred here so to say
I lived here so very happily withher who left us so earlyshe whom
you knew when you were here before Arnholm

Arnholm Yes yes

Wangel And now I live here so happily with her who has taken her place
Ah On the whole fate has been very good to me

Arnholm You have no children by your second marriage Wangel We had a
little boy twotwo and a half years ago But he didnt stay long He
died when he was fourfive months old

Arnholm Isnt your wife at home today

Wangel Oh yes Shes sure to be here soon Shes down there bathing
She does so every blessed day no matter what the weather

Arnholm Is she ill then

Wangel Not exactly ill although she has been extremely nervous for the
last few yearsthat is to say she is now and then I cant make out
what really ails her But to plunge into the sea is her joy and delight

Arnholm Yes I remember that of old

Wangel with an almost imperceptible smile To be sure You knew Ellida
when you were teacher out there at Skjoldviken

Arnholm Certainly She used often to visit at the Parsonage But I
mostly met her when I went to the lighthouse to see her father

Wangel Those times out there you may believe me have set deep marks
upon her The people in the town here cant understand her at all They
call her the Lady from the Sea

Arnholm Do they

Wangel Yes And sonow you see speak to her of the old days dear
Arnholm it will do her good

Arnholm looks at him in doubt Have you any reason for thinking so

Wangel Assuredly I have

Ellida her voice is heard outside the garden Are you there Wangel

Wangel rising Yes dear

Mrs ELLIDA WANGEL in a large light wrap and with wet hair hanging
loose over her shoulders comes from between the trees of the arbour
ARNHOLM rises

Wangel smiling and holding out his hands to her Ah So now we have
our Mermaid

Ellida goes quickly up the verandah and seizes his hands Thank God
that I see you again When did you come

Wangel Just now a little while since Pointing to ARNHOLM But wont
you greet an old acquaintance

Ellida holding out her hand to ARNHOLM So here you are Welcome And
forgive me for not being at home

Arnholm Dont mention itdont stand on any ceremony

Wangel Was the water nice and fresh today

Ellida Fresh Oh The water here never is fresh It is so tepid and
lifeless Ugh The water in the fjord here is sick

Arnholm Sick

Ellida Yes sick And I believe it makes one sick too

Wangel smiling Youre giving our bathing resort a good name

Arnholm I should rather believe Mrs Wangel that you have a peculiar
relation to the sea and to all that belongs to it

Ellida Perhaps I almost think so myself But do you see how festively
the girls have arranged everything in your honour

Wangel embarrassed Hm Looks at his watch Well I suppose I must
be quick and

Arnholm Is it really for me

Ellida Yes You may be sure we dont decorate like this every day
Ugh How suffocatingly hot it is under this roof Goes down into the
garden Come over here Here at least there is a little air Sits down
in arbour

Arnholm going thither I think the air quite fresh here

Ellida Yes youwho are used to the stifling air of the town Its
terrible there in the summer I hear

Wangel who has also gone into the garden Hm dear Ellida you must
just entertain our friend alone for a little while

Ellida Are you busy

Wangel Yes I must go down to the office And then I must change But I
wont be long

Arnholm sitting down in arbour Now dont hurry dear doctor Your
wife and I will manage to kill the time

Wangel nodding Oh yes Im sure you will Well goodbye for the
present He goes out through the garden

Ellida after a short pause Dont you think its pleasant sitting out
here

Arnholm I think Ive a pleasant seat now

Ellida They call this my arbour because I had it fitted up or rather
Wangel did for me

Arnholm And you usually sit here

Ellida Yes I pass most of the day here

Arnholm With the girls I suppose

Ellida No the girlsusually sit on the verandah

Arnholm And Wangel himself

Ellida Oh Wangel goes to and fronow he comes to me and then he goes
to his children

Arnholm And is it you who wish this

Ellida I think all parties feel most comfortable in this way You
know we can talk across to one anotherif we happen to find there is
anything to say

Arnholm after thinking awhile When I last crossed your pathout at
Skjoldviken I meanHm That is long ago now

Ellida Its quite ten years since you were there with us

Arnholm Yes about that But when I think of you out there in the
lighthouse The heathen as the old clergyman called you because your
father had named you as he said after an old ship and hadnt given
you a name fit for a Christian

Ellida Well what then

Arnholm The last thing I should then have believed was that I should
see you again down here as the wife of Wangel

Ellida No at that time Wangel wasntat that time the girls first
mother was still living Their real mother so Arnholm Of course of
course But even if that had not beeneven if he had been freestill I
could never have believed this would come about

Ellida Nor I Never on earththen

Arnholm Wangel is such a good fellow So honourable So thoroughly good
and kind to all men

Ellida warmly and heartily Yes he is indeed

Arnholm But he must be so absolutely different from you I fancy

Ellida You are right there So he is

Arnholm Well but how did it happen How did it come about

Ellida Ah dear Arnholm you mustnt ask me about that I couldnt
explain it to you and even if I could you would never be able to
understand in the least

Arnholm Hm In lower tone Have you ever confided anything about me
to your husband Of course I meant about the useless stepI allowed
myself to be moved to

Ellida No You may be sure of that Ive not said a word to him
aboutabout what you speak of

Arnholm I am glad I felt rather awkward at the thought that

Ellida There was no need I have only told him what is truethat I
liked you very much and that you were the truest and best friend I had
out there

Arnholm Thanks for that But tell mewhy did you never write to me
after I had gone away

Ellida I thought that perhaps it would pain you to hear from one
whowho could not respond as you desired It seemed like reopening a
painful subject

Arnholm Hm Yes yes perhaps you were right

Ellida But why didnt you write

Arnholm looks at her and smiles half reproachfully I make the first
advance Perhaps expose myself to the suspicion of wanting to begin all
over again After such a repulse as I had had

Ellida Oh no I understand very well Have you never since thought of
forming any other tie

Arnholm Never I have been faithful to my first memories

Ellida half jestingly Nonsense Let the sad old memories alone Youd
better think of becoming a happy husband I should say

Arnholm I should have to be quick about it then Mrs Wangel
Remember Im alreadyIm ashamed to sayIm past thirtyseven

Ellida Well all the more reason for being quick She is silent for
a moment and then says earnestly in a low voice But listen dear
Arnholm now I am going to tell you something that I could not have told
you then to save my life

Arnholm What is it

Ellida When you took thethe useless step you were just speaking ofI
could not answer you otherwise than I did

Arnholm I know that you had nothing but friendship to give me I know
that well enough

Ellida But you did not know that all my mind and soul were then given
elsewhere

Arnholm At that time

Ellida Yes

Arnholm But it is impossible You are mistaken about the time I hardly
think you knew Wangel then

Ellida It is not Wangel of whom I speak

Arnholm Not Wangel But at that time out there at SkjoldvikenI cant
remember a single person whom I can imagine the possibility of your
caring for

Ellida No no I quite believe that for it was all such bewildering
madnessall of it

Arnholm But tell me more of this

Ellida Oh its enough if you know I was bound then and you know it
now

Arnholm And if you had not been bound

Ellida Well

Arnholm Would your answer to my letter have been different

Ellida How can I tell When Wangel came the answer was different

Arnholm What is your object then in telling me that you were bound

Ellida getting up as if in fear and unrest Because I must have
someone in whom to confide No no sit still

Arnholm Then your husband knows nothing about this

Ellida I confessed to him from the first that my thoughts had once been
elsewhere He never asked to know more and we have never touched upon
it since Besides at bottom it was simply madness And then it was over
directlythat is to a certain extent

Arnholm rising Only to a certain extent Not quite

Ellida Yes yes it is Oh good heavens Dear Arnholm it is not what
you think It is something so absolutely incomprehensible I dont know
how I could tell it you You would only think I was ill or quite mad

Arnholm My dearest lady Now you really must tell me all about it

Ellida Well then Ill try to How will you as a sensible man
explain to yourself thatLooks round and breaks off Wait a moment
Heres a visitor

LYNGSTRAND comes along the road and enters the garden He has a flower
in his buttonhole and carries a large handsome bouquet done up in
paper and silk ribbons He stands somewhat hesitatingly and undecidedly
by the verandah

Ellida from the arbour Have you come to see the girls Mr
Lyngstrand

Lyngstrand turning round Ah madam are you there Bows and
comes nearer No its not that Its not the young ladies Its you
yourself Mrs Wangel You know you gave me permission to come and see
you Ellida Of course I did You are always welcome here

Lyngstrand Thanks and as it falls out so luckily that its a festival
here today

Ellida Oh Do you know about that

Lyngstrand Rather And so I should like to take the liberty of
presenting this to Mrs Wangel Bows and offers her the bouquet

Ellida smiling But my dear Mr Lyngstrand oughtnt you to give
these lovely flowers to Mr Arnholm himself For you know its really
he Lyngstrand looking uncertainly at both of them Excuse me but I
dont know this gentleman Its onlyIve only come about the birthday
Mrs Wangel

Ellida Birthday Youve made a mistake Mr Lyngstrand Theres no
birthday here today

Lyngstrand smiling slyly Oh I know all about that But I didnt
think it was to be kept so dark

Ellida What do you know

Lyngstrand That it is Madams birthday

Ellida Mine

Arnholm looks questioningly at her Today Surely not

Ellida to LYNGSTRAND Whatever made you think that

Lyngstrand It was Miss Hilde who let it out I just looked in here a
little while ago and I asked the young ladies why they were decorating
the place like this with flowers and flags

Ellida Well

Lyngstrand And so Miss Hilde said Why today is mothers birthday

Ellida MothersI see

Arnholm Aha He and ELLIDA exchange a meaning look Well now that
the young man knows about it

Ellida to LYNGSTRAND Well now that you know

Lyngstrand offering her the bouquet again May I take the liberty of
congratulating you

Ellida taking the flowers My best thanks Wont you sit down a
moment Mr Lyngstrand ELLIDA ARNHOLM and LYNGSTRAND sit down in
the arbour Thisbirthday businesswas to have been kept secret Mr
Arnholm

Arnholm So I see It wasnt for us uninitiated folk

Ellida putting down the bouquet Just so Not for the uninitiated

Lyngstrand Pon my word I wont tell a living soul about it

Ellida Oh it wasnt meant like that But how are you getting on I
think you look better than you did

Lyngstrand Oh I think Im getting on famously And by next year if I
can go south

Ellida And you are going south the girls tell me

Lyngstrand Yes for Ive a benefactor and friend at Bergen who looks
after me and has promised to help me next year

Ellida How did you get such a friend

Lyngstrand Well it all happened so very luckily I once went to sea in
one of his ships

Ellida Did you So you wanted to go to sea

Lyngstrand No not at all But when mother died father wouldnt have
me knocking about at home any longer and so he sent me to sea Then we
were wrecked in the English Channel on our way home and that was very
fortunate for me

Arnholm What do you mean

Lyngstrand Yes for it was in the shipwreck that I got this little
weaknessof my chest I was so long in the icecold water before
they picked me up and so I had to give up the sea Yes that was very
fortunate

Arnholm Indeed Do you think so

Lyngstrand Yes for the weakness isnt dangerous and now I can be
a sculptor as I so dearly want to be Just think to model in that
delicious clay that yields so caressingly to your fingers

Ellida And what are you going to model Is it to be mermen and
mermaids Or is it to be old Vikings

Lyngstrand No not that As soon as I can set about it I am going to
try if I can produce a great worka group as they call it

Ellida Yes but whats the group to be

Lyngstrand Oh something Ive experienced myself

Arnholm Yes yes always stick to that

Ellida But whats it to be

Lyngstrand Well I thought it should be the young wife of a sailor who
lies sleeping in strange unrest and she is dreaming I fancy I shall do
it so that you will see she is dreaming

Arnholm Is there anything else

Lyngstrand Yes theres to be another figurea sort of apparition as
they say Its her husband to whom she has been faithless while he was
away and he is drowned at sea

Arnholm What

Ellida Drowned

Lyngstrand Yes he was drowned on a sea voyage But thats the
wonderful part of ithe comes home all the same It is nighttime And
he is standing by her bed looking at her He is to stand there dripping
wet like one drawn from the sea

Ellida leaning back in her chair What an extraordinary idea
Shutting her eyes Oh I can see it so clearly living before me

Arnholm But how on earth MrMrI thought you said it was to be
something you had experienced

Lyngstrand Yes I did experience thatthat is to say to a certain
extent

Arnholm You saw a dead man

Lyngstrand Well I dont mean Ive actually seen thisexperienced it
in the flesh But still

Ellida quickly intently Oh tell me all you can about it I must
understand about all this

Arnholm smiling Yes thatll be quite in your line Something that
has to do with sea fancies

Ellida What was it Mr Lyngstrand

Lyngstrand Well it was like this At the time when we were to sail
home in the brig from a town they called Halifax we had to leave
the boatswain behind in the hospital So we had to engage an American
instead This new boatswain Ellida The American

Lyngstrand Yes one day he got the captain to lend him a lot of old
newspapers and he was always reading them For he wanted to teach
himself Norwegian he said

Ellida Well and then

Lyngstrand It was one evening in rough weather All hands were on
deckexcept the boatswain and myself For he had sprained his foot and
couldnt walk and I was feeling rather low and was lying in my berth
Well he was sitting there in the forecastle reading one of those old
papers again

Ellida Well well

Lyngstrand But just as he was sitting there quietly reading I heard
him utter a sort of yell And when I looked at him I saw his face was
as white as chalk And then he began to crush and crumple the paper and
to tear it into a thousand shreds But he did it so quietly quietly

Ellida Didnt he say anything Didnt he speak

Lyngstrand Not directly but a little after he said to himself as it
were Marriedto another man While I was away

Ellida closes her eyes and says half to herself He said that

Lyngstrand Yes And thinkhe said it in perfect Norwegian That man
must have learnt foreign languages very easily

Ellida And what then What else happened

Lyngstrand Well now the remarkable part is comingthat I shall never
forget as long as I live For he added and that quite quietly too
But she is mine and mine she shall remain And she shall follow me if
I should come home and fetch her as a drowned man from the dark sea

Ellida pouring herself out a glass of water Her hand trembles Ah
How close it is here today

Lyngstrand And he said this with such strength of will that I thought
he must be the man to do it

Ellida Dont you know anything aboutwhat became of the man

Lyngstrand Oh madam hes certainly not living now

Ellida quickly Why do you think that

Lyngstrand Why Because we were shipwrecked afterwards in the Channel
I had got into the longboat with the captain and five others The mate
got into the sternboat and the American was in that too and another
man

Ellida And nothing has been heard of them since

Lyngstrand Not a word The friend who looks after me said so quite
recently in a letter But its just because of this I was so anxious to
make it into a work of art I see the faithless sailorwife so lifelike
before me and the avenger who is drowned and who nevertheless comes
home from the sea I can see them both so distinctly

Ellida I too Rises Come let us go inor rather go down
to Wangel I think it is so suffocatingly hot She goes out of the
arbour

Lyngstrand who has also risen I for my part must ask you to excuse
me This was only to be a short visit because of the birthday

Ellida As you wish Holds out her hand to him Goodbye and thank you
for the flowers

LYNGSTRAND bows and goes off through the garden gate

Arnholm rises and goes up to ELLIDA I see well enough that this has
gone to your heart Mrs Wangel

Ellida Yes you may well say so Although Arnholm But stillafter
all its no more than you were bound to expect

Ellida looks at him surprised Expect

Arnholm Well so it seems to me

Ellida Expect that anyone should come back againcome to life again
like that

Arnholm But what on earthis it that mad sculptors sea story then

Ellida Oh dear Arnholm perhaps it isnt so mad after all

Arnholm Is it that nonsense about the dead man that has moved you so
And I who thought that

Ellida What did you think

Arnholm I naturally thought that was only a makebelieve of yours And
that you were sitting here grieving because you had found out a family
feast was being kept secret because your husband and his children live
a life of remembrances in which you have no part

Ellida Oh no no That may be as it may I have no right to claim my
husband wholly and solely for myself

Arnholm I should say you had

Ellida Yes Yet all the same I have not That is it Why I too
live in something from which they are shut out

Arnholm You In lower tone Do you meanyou you do not really love
your husband

Ellida Oh yes yes I have learnt to love him with all my heart
And thats why it is so terribleso inexplicableso absolutely
inconceivable

Arnholm Now you must and shall confide all your troubles to me Will
you Mrs Wangel

Ellida I cannot dear friend Not now in any case Later perhaps

BOLETTE comes out into the verandah and goes down into the garden

Bolette Fathers coming up from the office Hadnt we better all of us
go into the sittingroom

Ellida Yes let us

WANGEL in other clothes comes with HILDE from behind the house

Wangel Now then here I am at your service And now we shall enjoy a
good glass of something cool

Ellida Wait a moment She goes into the arbour and fetches the
bouquet

Hilde I say All those lovely flowers Where did you get them

Ellida From the sculptor Lyngstrand my dear Hilde

Hilde starts From Lyngstrand

Bolette uneasily Has Lyngstrand been here again

Ellida with a halfsmile Yes He came here with these Because of the
birthday you understand

Bolette looks at HILDE Oh

Hilde mutters The idiot

Wangel in painful confusion to ELLIDA Hmyes well you seeI must
tell you my dear good beloved Ellida

Ellida interrupting Come girls Let us go and put my flowers in the
water together with the others Goes up to the verandah

Bolette to HILDE Oh After all she is good at heart

Wangel on the verandah presses ELLIDAS hand Thanksthanks My
heartfelt thanks for that dear Ellida

Ellida arranging the flowers Nonsense Should not I too be in it

He goes up to WANGEL and ELLIDA BOLETTE and HILDE remain in the
garden below




ACT II

SCENEAt the View a shrubcovered hill behind the town A little
in the background a beacon and a vane Great stones arranged as seats
around the beacon and in the foreground Farther back the outer fjord
is seen with islands and outstanding headlands The open sea is not
visible It is a summers evening and twilight A goldenred shimmer is
in the air and over the mountaintops in the far distance A quartette is
faintly heard singing below in the background Young townsfolk
ladies and gentlemen come up in pairs from the right and talking
familiarly pass out beyond the beacon A little after BALLESTED
enters as guide to a party of foreign tourists with their ladies He is
laden with shawls and travelling bags

Ballested pointing upwards with a stick Sehen Sie meine
Herrschaften dort out there liegt eine andere mountain That wollen
wir also besteigen and so herunter He goes on with the conversation
in French and leads the party off to the left HILDE comes quickly
along the uphill path stands still and looks back Soon after BOLETTE
comes up the same way

Bolette But dear why should we run away from Lyngstrand

Hilde Because I cant bear going uphill so slowly Looklook at him
crawling up

Bolette Ah But you know how delicate he is

Hilde Do you think its verydangerous

Bolette I certainly do

Hilde He went to consult father this afternoon I should like to know
what father thinks about him

Bolette Father told me it was a thickening of the lungs or something
of the sort He wont live to be old father says

Hilde No Did he say it Fancythats exactly what I thought

Bolette For heavens sake dont show it

Hilde How can you imagine such a thing In an undertone Look here
comes Hans crawling up Dont you think you can see by the look of him
that hes called Hans

Bolette whispering Now do behave Youd better

LYNGSTRAND comes in from the right a parasol in his hand

Lyngstrand I must beg the young ladies to excuse me for not getting
along as quickly as they did

Hilde Have you got a parasol too now

Lyngstrand Its your mothers She said I was to use it as a stick I
hadnt mine with me

Bolette Are they down there stillfather and the others

Lyngstrand Yes your father looked in at the restaurant for a moment
and the others are sitting out there listening to the music But they
were coming up here presently your mother said

Hilde stands looking at him I suppose youre thoroughly tired out
now

Lyngstrand Yes I almost think Im a little tired now I really believe
I shall have to sit down a moment He sits on one of the stones in the
foreground

Hilde standing in front of him Do you know theres to be dancing down
there on the parade

Lyngstrand Yes I heard there was some talk about it

Hilde I suppose you think dancings great fun

Bolette who begins gathering small flowers among the heather Oh
Hilde Now do let Mr Lyngstrand get his breath

Lyngstrand to HILDE Yes Miss Hilde I should very much like to
danceif only I could

Hilde Oh I see Havent you ever learnt

Lyngstrand No Ive not But it wasnt that I meant I meant I couldnt
because of my chest

Hilde Because of that weakness you said you suffered from

Lyngstrand Yes because of that

Hilde Arent you very sorry youve thatweakness

Lyngstrand Oh no I cant say I am smiling for I think its because
of it that everyone is so good and friendly and kind to me

Hilde Yes And then besides its not dangerous

Lyngstrand No its not at all dangerous So I gathered from what your
father said to me

Hilde And then it will pass away as soon as ever you begin travelling

Lyngstrand Of course it will pass away

Bolette with flowers Look here Mr Lyngstrand you are to put this
in your buttonhole

Lyngstrand Oh A thousand thanks Miss Wangel Its really too good of
you

Hilde looking down the path There they are coming along the road

Bolette also looking down If only they know where to turn off No
now theyre going wrong

Lyngstrand rising Ill run down to the turning and call out to them

Hilde Youll have to call out pretty loud

Bolette No its not worth while Youll only tire yourself again

Lyngstrand Oh its so easy going downhill Goes off to the right

Hilde Downhillyes Looking after him Why hes actually jumping
And he never remembers hell have to come up again

Bolette Poor fellow

Hilde If Lyngstrand were to propose would you accept him

Bolette Are you quite mad

Hilde Of course I mean if he werent troubled with that weakness
And if he werent to die so soon would you have him then

Bolette I think youd better have him yourself

Hilde No that I wouldnt Why he hasnt a farthing He hasnt enough
even to keep himself

Bolette Then why are you always going about with him

Hilde Oh I only do that because of the weakness

Bolette Ive never noticed that you in the least pity him for it

Hilde No I dont But I think it so interesting

Bolette What is

Hilde To look at him and make him tell you it isnt dangerous and that
hes going abroad and is to be an artist He really believes it all
and is so thoroughly happy about it And yet nothing will ever come of
it nothing whatever For he wont live long enough I feel thats so
fascinating to think of

Bolette Fascinating

Hilde Yes I think its most fascinating I take that liberty

Bolette Hilde you really are a dreadful child

Hilde Thats just what I want to beout of spite Looking down At
last I shouldnt think Arnholm liked coming uphill Turns round By
the way do you know what I noticed about Arnholm at dinner

Bolette Well

Hilde Just thinkhis hairs beginning to come offright on the top of
his head

Bolette Nonsense Im sure thats not true

Hilde It is And then he has wrinkles round both his eyes Good
gracious Bolette how could you be so much in love with him when he
used to read with you

Bolette smiling Yes Can you believe it I remember I once shed
bitter tears because he thought Bolette was an ugly name

Hilde Only to think Looking down No I say do just look down here
Theres the Mermaid walking along and chatting with him Not with
father I wonder if those two arent making eyes at one another

Bolette You ought to be ashamed of yourself How can you stand there
and say such a thing of her Now when everything was beginning to be so
pleasant between us

Hilde Of coursejust try and persuade yourself of that my child Oh
no It will never be pleasant between us and her For she doesnt belong
to us at all And we dont belong to her either Goodness knows what
father dragged her into the house for I shouldnt wonder if some fine
day she went mad under our very eyes

Bolette Mad How can you think such a thing

Hilde Oh it wouldnt be so extraordinary Her mother went mad too
She died madI know that

Bolette Yes heaven only knows what you dont poke your nose into But
now dont go chattering about this Do be goodfor fathers sake Do
you hear Hilde

WANGEL ELLIDA ARNHOLM and LYNGSTRAND come up from the right

Ellida pointing to the background Out there it lies

Arnholm Quite right It must be in that direction

Ellida Out there is the sea

Bolette to ARNHOLM Dont you think it is delightful up here

Arnholm Its magnificent I think Glorious view

Wangel I suppose you never used to come up here

Arnholm No never In my time I think it was hardly accessible there
wasnt any path even

Wangel And no grounds All this has been done during the last few
years

Bolette And there at the Pilots Mount its even grander than here

Wangel Shall we go there Ellida

Ellida sitting down on one of the stones Thanks not I but you
others can Ill sit here meanwhile

Wangel Then Ill stay with you The girls can show Arnholm about

Bolette Would you like to go with us Mr Arnholm

Arnholm I should like to very much Does a path lead up there too

Bolette Oh yes Theres a nice broad path

Hilde The path is so broad that two people can walk along it
comfortably arm in arm

Arnholm jestingly Is that really so little Missie To BOLETTE
Shall we two see if she is right

Bolette suppressing a smile Very well lets go They go out to the
left arm in arm

Hilde to LYNGSTRAND Shall we go too

Lyngstrand Arm in arm

Hilde Oh why not For aught I care

Lyngstrand taking her arm laughing contentedly This is a jolly lark

Hilde Lark

Lyngstrand Yes because it looks exactly as if we were engaged

Hilde Im sure youve never walked out arm in arm with a lady before
Mr Lyngstrand They go off

Wangel who is standing beside the beacon Dear Ellida now we have a
moment to ourselves

Ellida Yes come and sit down here by me

Wangel sitting down It is so free and quiet Now we can have a little
talk together

Ellida What about

Wangel About yourself and then about us both Ellida I see very well
that it cant go on like this

Ellida What do you propose instead

Wangel Perfect confidence dear A true life togetheras before

Ellida Oh if that could be But it is so absolutely impossible

Wangel I think I understand you from certain things you have let fall
now and again

Ellida passionately Oh you do not Dont say you understand

Wangel Yes Yours is an honest nature Ellidayours is a faithful
mind

Ellida It is

Wangel Any position in which you could feel safe and happy must be a
completely true and real one

Ellida looking eagerly at him Well and then

Wangel You are not suited to be a mans second wife

Ellida What makes you think that

Wangel It has often flashed across me like a foreboding Today it was
clear to me The childrens memorial feastyou saw in me a kind of
accomplice Well yes a mans memories after all cannot be wiped
outnot so mine anyhow It isnt in me

Ellida I know that Oh I know that so well

Wangel But you are mistaken all the same To you it is almost as if the
childrens mother were still livingas if she were still here invisible
amongst us You think my heart is equally divided between you and her
It is this thought that shocks you You see something immoral in our
relation and that is why you no longer can or will live with me as my
wife

Ellida rising Have you seen all that Wangelseen into all this

Wangel Yes today I have at last seen to the very heart of itto its
utmost depths

Ellida To its very heart you say Oh do not think that

Wangel rising I see very well that there is more than this dear
Ellida

Ellida anxiously You know there is more

Wangel Yes You cannot bear your surroundings here The mountains crush
you and weigh upon your heart Nothing is open enough for you here
The heavens above you are not spacious enough The air is not strong and
bracing enough

Ellida You are right Night and day winter and summer it weighs upon
methis irresistible homesickness for the sea

Wangel I know it well dear Ellida laying his hands upon her head
And that is why the poor sick child shall go home to her own again

Ellida What do you mean

Wangel Something quite simple We are going away

Ellida Going away

Wangel Yes Somewhere by the open seaa place where you can find a
true home after your own heart

Ellida Oh dear do not think of that That is quite impossible You
can live happily nowhere on earth but here

Wangel That must be as it may And besides do you think I can live
happily herewithout you

Ellida But I am here And I will stay here You have me

Wangel Have I Ellida

Ellida Oh dont speak of all this Why here you have all that you
love and strive for All your lifes work lies here

Wangel That must be as it may I tell you We are going away from
hereare going somewhereout there That is quite settled now dear
Ellida

Ellida What do you think we should gain by that

Wangel You would regain your health and peace of mind

Ellida Hardly And then you yourself Think of yourself too What of
you

Wangel I would win you back again my dearest

Ellida But you cannot do that No no you cant do that Wangel That
is the terrible part of itheartbreaking to think of

Wangel That remains to be proved If you are harbouring such thoughts
truly there is no other salvation for you than to go hence And the
sooner the better Now this is irrevocably settled do you hear

Ellida No Then in heavens name I had better tell you everything
straight out Everything just as it is

Wangel Yes yes Do

Ellida For you shall not ruin your happiness for my sake especially as
it cant help us in any way

Wangel I have your word now that you will tell me everything just as it
is

Ellida Ill tell you everything as well as I can and as far as I
understand it Come here and sit by me They sit down on the stones

Wangel Well Ellida so

Ellida That day when you came out there and asked me if I would
be yours you spoke so frankly and honestly to me about your first
marriage It had been so happy you said

Wangel And so it was

Ellida Yes yes I am sure of that dear It is not for that I am
referring to it now I only want to remind you that I on my side was
frank with you I told you quite openly that once in my life I had cared
for another That there had been aa kind of engagement between us

Wangel A kind of

Ellida Yes something of the sort Well it only lasted such a very
short time He went away and after that I put an end to it I told you
all that

Wangel Why rake up all this now It really didnt concern me nor have
I once asked you who he was

Ellida No you have not You are always so thoughtful for me

Wangel smiling Oh in this case I could guess the name well enough
for myself

Ellida The name

Wangel Out in Skjoldviken and thereabouts there werent many to choose
from or rather there was only a single one

Ellida You believe it was Arnholm

Wangel Well wasnt it

Ellida No

Wangel Not he Then I dont in the least understand

Ellida Can you remember that late in the autumn a large American ship
once put into Skjoldviken for repairs

Wangel Yes I remember it very well It was on board that ship that the
captain was found one morning in his cabinmurdered I myself went out
to make the postmortem

Ellida Yes it was you

Wangel It was the second mate who had murdered him

Ellida No one can say that For it was never proved

Wangel There was enough against him anyhow or why should he have
drowned himself as he did

Ellida He did not drown himself He sailed in a ship to the north

Wangel startled How do you know

Ellida with an effort Well Wangelit was this second mate to whom I
wasbetrothed

Wangel springing up What Is it possible

Ellida Yes it is so It was to him

Wangel But how on earth Ellida How did you come to betroth yourself
to such a man To an absolute stranger What is his name

Ellida At that time he called himself Friman Later in his letters he
signed himself Alfred Johnston

Wangel And where did he come from

Ellida From Finmark he said For the rest he was born in Finland had
come to Norway there as a child with his father I think

Wangel A Finlander then

Ellida Yes so he called himself

Wangel What else do you know about him

Ellida Only that he went to sea very young And that he had been on
long voyages

Wangel Nothing more

Ellida No We never spoke of such things

Wangel Of what did you speak then

Ellida We spoke mostly about the sea

Wangel Ah About the sea

Ellida About storms and calm Of dark nights at sea And of the sea
in the glittering sunshiny days we spoke also But we spoke most of the
whales and the dolphins and the seals who lie out there on the rocks
in the midday sun And then we spoke of the gulls and the eagles and
all the other sea birds I thinkisnt it wonderfulwhen we talked of
such things it seemed to me as if both the sea beasts and sea birds were
one with him

Wangel And with you

Ellida Yes I almost thought I belonged to them all too

Wangel Well well And so it was that you betrothed yourself to him

Ellida Yes He said I must

Wangel You must Had you no will of your own then

Ellida Not when he was near Ah afterwards I thought it all so
inexplicable

Wangel Were you often together

Ellida No not very often One day he came out to our place and looked
over the lighthouse After that I got to know him and we met now and
again But then that happened about the captain and so he had to go
away

Wangel Yes yes Tell me more about that

Ellida It was just daybreak when I had a note from him He said in it
I was to go out to him at the Bratthammer You know the headland there
between the lighthouse and Skjoldviken

Wangel I know I know

Ellida I was to go out there at once he wrote because he wanted to
speak to me

Wangel And you went

Ellida Yes I could not do otherwise Well then he told me he had
stabbed the captain in the night

Wangel He said that himself Actually said so

Ellida Yes But he had only acted rightly and justly he said

Wangel Rightly and justly Why did he stab him then

Ellida He wouldnt speak out about that He said it was not fit for me
to hear

Wangel And you believed his naked bare word

Ellida Yes It never occurred to me to do otherwise Well anyhow he
had to go away But now when he was to bid me farewell No you never
could imagine what he thought of

Wangel Well Tell me

Ellida He took from his pocket a keyringand drew a ring that he
always wore from his finger and he took a small ring I had These two
he put on the keyring And then he said we should wed ourselves to the
sea

Wangel Wed

Ellida Yes so he said And with that he threw the keyring and our
rings with all his might as far as he could into the deep

Wangel And you Ellida you did all this

Ellida Yesonly thinkit then seemed to me as if it must be so But
thank God Ihe went away

Wangel And when he was gone

Ellida Oh You can surely understand that I soon came to my senses
againthat I saw how absolutely mad and meaningless it had all been

Wangel But you spoke just now of letters So you have heard from him
since

Ellida Yes I have heard from him First I had a few short lines from
Archangel He only wrote he was going to America And then he told me
where to send an answer

Wangel And did you

Ellida At once I wrote him of course that all must be at an end
between us and that he must no longer think of me just as I should no
longer think of him

Wangel But did he write again

Ellida Yes he wrote again

Wangel And what was his answer to your communication

Ellida He took no notice of it It was exactly as if I had never broken
with him He wrote quite composedly and calmly that I must wait for him
When he could have me he would let me know and then I was to go to him
at once

Wangel So he would not release you

Ellida No Then I wrote again almost word for word as I had before or
perhaps more firmly

Wangel And he gave in

Ellida Oh no Dont think that He wrote quietly as beforenot a
word of my having broken with him Then I knew it was useless and so I
never wrote to him again

Wangel And you never heard from him

Ellida Oh yes I have had three letters since then Once he wrote to
me from California and a second time from China The last letter I had
from him was from Australia He wrote he was going to the goldmines
but since then he has made no sign

Wangel This man has had a strange power over you Ellida

Ellida Yes yes The terrible man

Wangel But you mustnt think of that any more Never againnever
Promise me that my dear beloved Ellida Now we must try another
treatment for you Fresher air than here within the fjords The salt
fresh air of the sea Dear what say you to that

Ellida Oh dont speak of it Dont think of it There is no help in
this for me I feel that so well I cant shake it offnot even there

Wangel What dearWhat do you really mean

Ellida I mean the horror of it this incomprehensible power over the
mind

Wangel But you have shaken it offlong sincewhen you broke with him
Why all this is long past now

Ellida springing up No that it is notit is not

Wangel Not past

Ellida No Wangel it is not past and I fear it never will benever
in all our life

Wangel in a pained voice Do you mean to say that in your innermost
heart you have never been able to forget this strange man

Ellida I had forgotten him but then it was as if he had suddenly come
back again

Wangel How long ago is that

Ellida Its about three years ago now or a little longer It was just
when I expected the child

Wangel Ah at that time Yes Ellidanow I begin to understand many
things

Ellida You are mistaken dear What has come to me Oh I believe
nothing on earth will ever make it clear

Wangel looking sadly at her Only to think that all these three years
you have cared for another man Cared for another Not for mebut for
another

Ellida Oh you are so utterly mistaken I care for no one but you

Wangel in a subdued voice Why then in all this time have you not
lived with me as my wife

Ellida Because of the horror that comes from the strange man

Wangel The horror

Ellida Yes the horror A horror so terriblesuch as only the sea
could hold For now you shall hear Wangel

The young townsfolk come back bow and pass out to the right Together
with them come ARNHOLM BOLETTE HILDE and LYNGSTRAND

Bolette as she passes by Well are you still walking about up here

Ellida Yes it is so cool and pleasant up here on the heights

Arnholm We for our part are going down for a dance

Wangel All right Well soon come downwe also

Hilde Goodbye for the present

Ellida Mr Lyngstrand will you wait one moment LYNGSTRAND Stops
ARNHOLM BOLETTE and HILDE go out To LYNGSTRAND Are you going to
dance too

Lyngstrand No Mrs Wangel I dont think I dare

Ellida No you should be careful you knowyour chest Youre not
quite well yet you see

Lyngstrand Not quite

Ellida with some hesitation How long may it be now since you went on
that voyage

Lyngstrand That time when I contracted this weakness

Ellida Yes that voyage you told me about this morning

Lyngstrand Oh its aboutwait a momentyes its a good three years
now

Ellida Three years then

Lyngstrand Perhaps a little more We left America in February and we
were wrecked in March It was the equinoctial gales we came in for

Ellida looking at WANGEL So it was at that time

Wangel But dear Ellida

Ellida Well dont let me detain you Mr Lyngstrand Now go down but
dont dance

Lyngstrand No Ill only look on He goes out

Ellida Johnston was on board too I am quite certain of it

Wangel What makes you think so

Ellida without answering He learnt on board that I had married
another while he was away And so that very hour this came over me

Wangel The horror

Ellida Yes all of a sudden I see him alive right in front of me or
rather a little in profile He never looks at me only he is there

Wangel How do you think he looks

Ellida Exactly as when I saw him last

Wangel Ten years ago

Ellida Yes out there at Bratthammeren Most distinctly of all I see
his breastpin with a large bluishwhite pearl in it The pearl is like
a dead fishs eye and it seems to glare at me

Wangel Good God You are more ill than I thought More ill than you
yourself know Ellida

Ellida Yes yes Help me if you can for I feel how it is drawing
closer and more close

Wangel And you have gone about in this state three whole years bearing
for yourself this secret suffering without confiding in me

Ellida But I could not not till it became necessary for your own sake
If I had confided in you I should also have had to confide to you the
unutterable

Wangel Unutterable

Ellida No no no Do not ask Only one thing nothing more Wangel
when shall we understand that mystery of the boys eyes

Wangel My dear love Ellida I assure you it was only your own fancy
The child had exactly the same eyes as other normal children have

Ellida No he had not And you could not see it The childs eyes
changed colour with the sea When the fjord lay bathed in sunshine so
were his eyes And so in storm Oh I saw it if you did not

Wangel humouring her Maybe But even if it were true what then

Ellida in lower voice and coming nearer I have seen such eyes
before

Wangel Well Where

Ellida Out at Bratthammeren ten years ago

Wangel stepping back What does it mean

Ellida whispers trembling The child had the strange mans eyes

Wangel cries out reluctantly Ellida

Ellida clasps her hands despairingly about her head Now you
understand why I would not why I dared not live with you as your wife
She turns suddenly and rushes off over the heights

Wangel hurrying after her and calling Ellida Ellida My poor unhappy
Ellida




ACT III

SCENEA more remote part of DOCTOR WANGELS garden It is boggy and
overshadowed by large old trees To the right is seen the margin of a
dank pond A low open fence separates the garden from the footpath and
the fjord in the background Beyond is the range of mountains with its
peaks It is afternoon almost evening BOLETTE sits on a stone seat
and on the seat lie some books and a workbasket HILDE and LYNGSTRAND
both with fishingtackle walk along the bank of the pond

Hilde making a sign to LYNGSTRAND I can see a large one

Lyngstrand looking Where

Hilde pointing Cant you see Hes down there Good gracious Theres
another Looks through the trees Out there Now hes coming to
frighten him away

Bolette looking up Whos coming

Hilde Your tutor Miss

Bolette Mine

Hilde Yes Goodness knows he never was mine

ARNHOLM enters from between the trees

Arnholm Are there fish in the pond now

Hilde There are some very ancient carp

Arnholm No Are the old carp still alive

Hilde Yes theyre pretty tough But now were going to try and get rid
of some of them

Arnholm Youd better try out there at the fjord

Lyngstrand No the pond iswellso to saymore mysterious

Hilde Yes its fascinating here Have you been in the sea

Arnholm Yes Ive come straight from the baths

Hilde I suppose you kept in the enclosure

Arnholm Yes Im not much of a swimmer

Hilde Can you swim on your back

Arnholm No

Hilde I can To LYNGSTRAND Lets try out there on the other side
They go off along the pond

Arnholm coming closer to BOLETTE Are you sitting all alone here
Bolette

Bolette Yes I generally do

Arnholm Isnt your mother down here in the garden

Bolette Noshes sure to be out with father

Arnholm How is she this afternoon

Bolette I dont quite know I forgot to ask

Arnholm What books have you there

Bolette The ones something about botany And the others a geography

Arnholm Do you care about such things

Bolette Yes if only I had time for it But first of all Ive to look
after the housekeeping

Arnholm Doesnt your mother help youyour stepmotherdoesnt she help
with that

Bolette No thats my business Why I saw to that during the two years
father was alone And so it has been since

Arnholm But youre as fond as ever of reading

Bolette Yes I read all the useful books I can get hold of One wants
to know something about the world For here we live so completely
outside of all thats going onor almost

Arnholm Now dont say that dear Bolette

Bolette Yes I think we live very much as the carp down there in the
pond They have the fjord so near them where the shoals of wild fishes
pass in and out But the poor tame housefishes know nothing and they
can take no part in that

Arnholm I dont think it would fare very well with them if they could
get out there

Bolette Oh it would be much the same I expect

Arnholm Moreover you cant say that one is so completely out of the
world herenot in the summer anyhow Why nowadays this is quite a
rendezvous for the busy worldalmost a terminus for the time being

Bolette Ah yes you who yourself are only here for the time beingit
is easy for you to make fun of us

Arnholm I make fun How can you think that

Bolette Well all that about this being a rendezvous and a terminus
for the busy worldthats something youve heard the townsfolk here
saying Yestheyre in the habit of saying that sort of thing

Arnholm Well frankly Ive noticed that too

Bolette But really theres not an atom of truth in it Not for us who
always live here What good is it to us that the great strange world
comes hither for a time on its way North to see the midnight sun We
ourselves have no part in that we see nothing of the midnight sun No
Weve got to be good and live our lives here in our carp pond

Arnholm sitting down by her Now tell me dear Bolette isnt there
something or othersomething definite you are longing for

Bolette Perhaps

Arnholm What is it really What is it you are longing for

Bolette Chiefly to get away

Arnholm That above all then

Bolette Yes and then to learn more To really know something about
everything

Arnholm When I used to teach you your father often said he would let
you go to college

Bolette Yes poor father He says so many things But when it comes to
the point hetheres no real stamina in father

Arnholm No unfortunately youre right there He has not exactly
stamina But have you ever spoken to him about itspoken really
earnestly and seriously

Bolette No Ive not quite done that

Arnholm But really you ought to Before it is too late Bolette why
dont you

Bolette Oh I suppose its because theres no real stamina in me
either I certainly take after father in that

Arnholm Hmdont you think youre unjust to yourself there

Bolette No unfortunately Besides father has so little time for
thinking of me and my future and not much desire to either He prefers
to put such things away from him whenever he can He is so completely
taken up with Ellida

Arnholm With whom What

Bolette I mean that he and my stepmotherbreaks off Father and
mother suffice one another as you see

Arnholm Well so much the better if you were to get away from here

Bolette Yes but I dont think Ive a right to not to forsake father

Arnholm But dear Bolette youll have to do that sometime anyhow So
it seems to me the sooner the better

Bolette I suppose there is nothing else for it After all I must think
of myself too I must try and get occupation of some sort When once
fathers gone I have no one to hold to But poor father I dread
leaving him

Arnholm Dread

Bolette Yes for fathers sake

Arnholm But good heavens Your stepmother She is left to him

Bolette Thats true But shes not in the least fit to do all that
mother did so well There is so much she doesnt see or that she wont
see or that she doesnt care about I dont know which it is

Arnholm Um I think I understand what you mean

Bolette Poor father He is weak in some things Perhaps youve noticed
that yourself He hasnt enough occupation either to fill up his time
And then she is so thoroughly incapable of helping him however thats
to some extent his own fault

Arnholm In what way

Bolette Oh father always likes to see happy faces about him There
must be sunshine and joy in the house he says And so Im afraid he
often gives her medicine which will do her little good in the long run

Arnholm Do you really think that

Bolette Yes I cant get rid of the thought She is so odd at times
Passionately But isnt it unjust that I should have to stay at home
here Really its not of any earthly use to father Besides I have a
duty towards myself too I think

Arnholm Do you know what Bolette We two must talk these matters over
more carefully

Bolette Oh That wont be much use I suppose I was created to stay
here in the carp pond

Arnholm Not a bit of it It depends entirely upon yourself

Bolette quickly Do you think so

Arnholm Yes believe me it lies wholly and solely in your own hands

Bolette If only that were true Will you perhaps put in a good word for
me with father

Arnholm Certainly But first of all I must speak frankly and freely
with you yourself dear

Bolette looks out to the left Hush dont let them notice anything
Well speak of this later

ELLIDA enters from the left She has no hat on but a large shawl is
thrown over her head and shoulders

Ellida with restless animation How pleasant it is here How
delightful it is here

Arnholm rising Have you been for a walk

Ellida Yes a long long lovely walk up there with Wangel And now
were going for a sail

Bolette Wont you sit down

Ellida No thanks I wont sit down

Bolette making room on seat Heres a pleasant seat

Ellida walking about No no no Ill not sit downnot sit down

Arnholm Im sure your walk has done you good You look quite refreshed

Ellida Oh I feel so thoroughly wellI feel so unspeakably happy So
safe so safe Looking out to the left What great steamer is that
coming along there

Bolette rising and also looking out It must be the large English
ship

Arnholm Its passing the buoy Does it usually stop here

Bolette Only for half an hour It goes farther up the fjord

Ellida And then sails away again tomorrowaway over the great open
searight over the sea Only think to be with them If one could If
only one could

Arnholm Have you never been any long sea voyage Mrs Wangel

Ellida Never only those little trips in the fjord here

Bolette with a sigh Ah no I suppose we must put up with the dry
land

Arnholm Well after all that really is our home

Ellida No I dont think it is

Arnholm Not the land

Ellida No I dont believe so I think that if only men had from
the beginning accustomed themselves to live on the sea or in the sea
perhaps we should be more perfect than we areboth better and happier

Arnholm You really think that

Ellida Yes I should like to know if we should not Ive often spoken
to Wangel about it

Arnholm Well and he

Ellida He thinks it might be so

Arnholm jestingly Well perhaps But it cant be helped Weve once
for all entered upon the wrong path and have become land beasts instead
of sea beasts Anyhow I suppose its too late to make good the mistake
now

Ellida Yes youve spoken a sad truth And I think men instinctively
feel something of this themselves And they bear it about with them as a
secret regret and sorrow Believe meherein lies the deepest cause for
the sadness of men Yes believe me in this

Arnholm But my dearest Mrs Wangel I have not observed that men are
so extremely sad It seems to me on the contrary that most of them
take life easily and pleasantlyand with a great quiet unconscious
joy

Ellida Oh no it is not so The joy is I suppose something like our
joy at the long pleasant summer daysit has the presentiment of the
dark days coming And it is this presentiment that casts its shadows
over the joy of men just as the driving clouds cast their shadow over
the fjords It lies there so bright and blueand of a sudden

Arnholm You shouldnt give way to such sad thoughts Just now you were
so glad and so bright

Ellida Yes yes so I was Oh thisthis is so stupid of me Looking
about her uneasily If only Wangel would come He promised me so
faithfully he would And yet he does not come Dear Mr Arnholm wont
you try and find him for me

Arnholm Gladly

Ellida Tell him he must come here directly now For now I cant see
him

Arnholm Not see him

Ellida Oh you dont understand When he is not by me I often cant
remember how he looks And then it is as if I had quite lost him That
is so terribly painful But do go please She paces round the pond

Bolette to ARNHOLM I will go with youyou dont know the way

Arnholm Nonsense I shall be all right

Bolette aside No no no I am anxious Im afraid he is on board the
steamer

Arnholm Afraid

Bolette Yes He usually goes to see if there are any acquaintances of
his And theres a restaurant on board

Arnholm Ah Come then

He and BOLETTE go off ELLIDA stands still awhile staring down at the
pond Now and again she speaks to herself in a low voice and breaks
off Along the footpath beyond the garden fence a STRANGER in travelling
dress comes from the left His hair and beard are bushy and red He has
a Scotch cap on and a travelling bag with strap across his shoulders

The Stranger goes slowly along by the fence and peeps into the garden
When he catches sight of ELLIDA he stands still looks at her fixedly
and searchingly and speaks in a low voice Goodevening Ellida

Ellida turns round with a cry Oh dear have you come at last

The Stranger Yes at last

Ellida looking at him astonished and frightened Who are you Do you
seek anyone here

The Stranger You surely know that well enough Ellida

Ellida starting What is this How do you address me Whom are you
looking for

The Stranger Well I suppose Im looking for you

Ellida shuddering Oh She stares at him totters back uttering a
halfsuffocating cry The eyesthe eyes

The Stranger Are you beginning to recognise me at last I knew you at
once Ellida

Ellida The eyes Dont look at me like that I shall cry for help

The Stranger Hush hush Do not fear I shant hurt you

Ellida covering her eyes with her hands Do not look at me like that
I say

The Stranger leaning with his arms on the garden fence I came with
the English steamer

Ellida stealing a frightened look at him What do you want with me

The Stranger I promised you to come as soon as I could

Ellida Gogo away Never never come here again I wrote to you that
everything must be over between useverything Oh you know that

The Stranger imperturbably and not answering her I would gladly have
come to you sooner but I could not Now at last I am able to and I am
here Ellida

Ellida What is it you want with me What do you mean Why have you come
here

The Stranger Surely you know Ive come to fetch you

Ellida recoils in terror To fetch me Is that what you mean

The Stranger Of course

Ellida But surely you know that I am married

The Stranger Yes I know

Ellida And yetand yet you have come toto fetch me

The Stranger Certainly I have

Ellida seizing her head with both her hands Oh this miserythis
horror This horror

The Stranger Perhaps you dont want to come

Ellida bewildered Dont look at me like that

The Stranger I was asking you if you didnt want to come

Ellida No no no Never in all eternity I will not I tell you I
neither can nor will In lower tone I dare not

The Stranger climbs over the fence and comes into the garden Well
Ellida let me tell you one thing before I go

Ellida wishes to fly but cannot She stands as one paralysed with
terror and leans for support against the trunk of a tree by the pond
Dont touch me Dont come near me No nearer Dont touch me I say

The Stranger cautiously coming a few steps nearer You need not be so
afraid of me Ellida

Ellida covering her eyes with her hands Dont look at me like that

The Stranger Do not be afraidnot afraid

WANGEL comes through the garden from the left

Wangel still halfway between the trees Well youve had to wait for
me a long while

Ellida rushes towards him clings fast to his arm and cries out Oh
Wangel Save me You save meif you can

Wangel Ellida What in heavens name

Ellida Save me Wangel Dont you see him there Why he is standing
there

Wangel looking thither That man Coming nearer May I ask you who
you are and what you have come into this garden for

The Stranger motions with a nod towards ELLIDA I want to talk to her

Wangel Oh indeed So I suppose it was you To ELLIDA I hear a
stranger has been to the house and asked for you

The Stranger Yes it was I

Wangel And what do you want with my wife Turning round Do you know
him Ellida

Ellida in a low voice and wringing her hands Do I know him Yes yes
yes

Wangel quickly Well

Ellida Why it is he Wangelhe himself He who you know

Wangel What What is it you say Turning Are you the Johnston who
once

The Stranger You may call me Johnston for aught I care However thats
not my name

Wangel It is not

The Stranger It isno longer No

Wangel And what may you want with my wife For I suppose you know the
lighthousekeepers daughter has been married this long time and whom
she married you of course also know

The Stranger Ive known it over three years

Ellida eagerly How did you come to know it

The Stranger I was on my way home to you Ellida I came across an old
newspaper It was a paper from these parts and in it there was that
about the marriage

Ellida looking straight in front of her The marriage So it was that

The Stranger It seemed so wonderful to me For the ringswhy that
too was a marriage Ellida

Ellida covering her face with her hands OhWangel How dare you

The Stranger Have you forgotten that

Ellida feeling his look suddenly cries out Dont stand there and
look at me like that

Wangel goes up to him You must deal with me and not with her In
shortnow that you know the circumstanceswhat is it you really want
here Why do you seek my wife

The Stranger I promised Ellida to come to her as soon as I could

Wangel Ellida again

The Stranger And Ellida promised faithfully she would wait for me until
I came

Wangel I notice you call my wife by her first name This kind of
familiarity is not customary with us here

The Stranger I know that perfectly But as she first and above all
belongs to me

Wangel To you still

Ellida draws back behind WANGEL Oh he will never release me

Wangel To you You say she belongs to you

The Stranger Has she told you anything about the two ringsmy ring and
Ellidas

Wangel Certainly And what then She put an end to that long ago You
have had her letters so you know this yourself

The Stranger Both Ellida and I agreed that what we did should have all
the strength and authority of a real and full marriage

Ellida But you hear I will not Never on earth do I wish to know
anything more of you Do not look at me like that I will not I tell
you

Wangel You must be mad to think you can come here and base any claim
upon such childish nonsense

The Stranger Thats true A claim in your sense I certainly have not

Wangel What do you mean to do then You surely do not imagine you can
take her from me by force against her own will

The Stranger No What would be the good of that If Ellida wishes to be
with me she must come freely

Ellida starts crying out Freely

Wangel And you actually believe that

Ellida to herself Freely

Wangel You must have taken leave of your senses Go your ways We have
nothing more to do with you

The Stranger looking at his watch It is almost time for me to go on
board again Coming nearer Yes yes Ellida now I have done my duty
Coming still nearer I have kept the word I gave you

Ellida beseechingly drawing away Oh dont touch me

The Stranger And so now you must think it over till tomorrow night

Wangel There is nothing to think over here See that you get away

The Stranger still to ELLIDA Now Im going with the steamer up the
fjord Tomorrow night I will come again and then I shall look for you
here You must wait for me here in the garden for I prefer settling the
matter with you alone you understand

Ellida in low trembling tone Do you hear that Wangel

Wangel Only keep calm We shall know how to prevent this visit

The Stranger Goodbye for the present Ellida So tomorrow night

Ellida imploringly Oh no no Do not come tomorrow night Never come
here again

The Stranger And should you then have a mind to follow me over the
seas

Ellida Oh dont look at me like that

The Stranger I only mean that you must then be ready to set out

Wangel Go up to the house Ellida

Ellida I cannot Oh help me Save me Wangel

The Stranger For you must remember that if you do not go with me
tomorrow all is at an end

Ellida looks tremblingly at him Then all is at an end Forever

The Stranger nodding Nothing can change it then Ellida I shall
never again come to this land You will never see me again nor hear
from me either Then I shall be as one dead and gone from you forever

Ellida breathing with difficulty Oh

The Stranger So think carefully what you do Goodbye He goes to the
fence and climbs over it stands still and says Yes Ellida be ready
for the journey tomorrow night For then I shall come and fetch you He
goes slowly and calmly down the footpath to the right

Ellida looking after him for a time Freely he said thinkhe said
that I must go with him freely

Wangel Only keep calm Why hes gone now and youll never see him
again

Ellida Oh how can you say that Hes coming again tomorrow night

Wangel Let him come He shall not meet you again in any case

Ellida shaking her head Ah Wangel Do not believe you can prevent
him

Wangel I can dearest only trust me

Ellida pondering and not listening to him Now when hes been here
tomorrow nightand then when he has gone over seas in the steamer

Wangel Yes what then

Ellida I should like to know if he will never never come back again

Wangel No dear Ellida You may be quite sure of that What should he
do here after this Now that he has learnt from your own lips that you
will have nothing more to do with him With that the whole thing is
over

Ellida to herself Tomorrow then or never

Wangel And should it ever occur to him to come here again

Ellida Well

Wangel Why then it is in our power to make him harmless

Ellida Oh do not think that

Wangel It is in our power I tell you If you can get rid of him in no
other way he must expiate the murder of the captain

Ellida passionately No no no Never that We know nothing about the
murder of the captain Nothing whatever

Wangel Know nothing Why he himself confessed it to you

Ellida No nothing of that If you say anything of it I shall deny it
He shall not be imprisoned He belongs out thereto the open sea He
belongs out there

Wangel looks at her and says slowly Ah EllidaEllida

Ellida clinging passionately to him Oh dear faithful onesave me
from this man

Wangel disengaging himself gently Come come with me LYNGSTRAND
and HILDE both with fishing tackle come in from the right along the
pond

Lyngstrand going quickly up to ELLIDA Now Mrs Wangel you must hear
something wonderful

Wangel What is it

Lyngstrand Fancy Weve seen the American

Wangel The American

Hilde Yes I saw him too

Lyngstrand He was going round the back of the garden and thence on
board the great English steamer

Wangel How do you know the man

Lyngstrand Why I went to sea with him once I felt so certain hed
been drownedand now hes very much alive

Wangel Do you know anything more about him

Lyngstrand No But Im sure hes come to revenge himself upon his
faithless sailorwife

Wangel What do you mean

Hilde Lyngstrands going to use him for a work of art

Wangel I dont understand one word

Ellida You shall hear afterwards

ARNHOLM and BOLETTE come from the left along the footpath outside the
garden

Bolette to those in the garden Do come and see The great English
steamers just going up the fjord

A large steamer glides slowly past in the distance

Lyngstrand to HILDE behind the garden fence Tonight hes sure to come
to her

Hilde nods To the faithless sailorwifeyes

Lyngstrand Fancy at midnight

Hilde That must be so fascinating

Ellida looking after the ship Tomorrow then

Wangel And then never again

Ellida in a low imploring tone Oh Wangel save me from myself

Wangel looks anxiously at her EllidaI feel there is something
behind this

Ellida There isthe temptation

Wangel Temptation

Ellida The man is like the sea

She goes slowly and thoughtfully through the garden and out to the
left WANGEL walks uneasily by her side watching her closely




ACT IV

SCENEDOCTOR WANGELS gardenroom Doors right and left In the
background between the windows an open glass door leading out on to
the verandah Below this a portion of the garden is visible A sofa
and table down left To the right a piano and farther back a large
flowerstand In the middle of the room a round table with chairs On
the table is a rosetree in bloom and other plants around it Morning

In the room by the table BOLETTE is sitting on the sofa busy with
some embroidery LYNGSTRAND is seated on a chair at the upper end of
the table In the garden below BALLESTED sits painting HILDE stands by
watching him

Lyngstrand with his arms on the table sits silent awhile looking at
BOLETTES work It must be awfully difficult to do a border like that
Miss Wangel

Bolette Oh no Its not very difficult if only you take care to count
right

Lyngstrand To count Must you count too

Bolette Yes the stitches See

Lyngstrand So you do Just fancy Why its almost a kind of art Can
you design too

Bolette Oh yes When Ive a copy

Lyngstrand Not unless

Bolette No

Lyngstrand Well then after all its not a real art

Bolette No it is rather only a sort ofhandicraft

Lyngstrand But still I think that perhaps you could learn art

Bolette If I havent any talent

Lyngstrand Yes if you could always be with a real true artist

Bolette Do you think then I could learn it from him

Lyngstrand Not exactly learn in the ordinary sense but I think it
would grow upon you little by littleby a kind of miracle as it were
Miss Wangel

Bolette That would be wonderful

Lyngstrand after a pause Have you ever thought aboutI mean have
you ever thought deeply and earnestly about marriage Miss Wangel

Bolette looking quickly at him Aboutno

Lyngstrand I have

Bolette Really Have you

Lyngstrand Oh yes I often think about things of that sort especially
about marriage and besides Ive read several books about it I
think marriage must be counted a sort of miraclethat a woman should
gradually change until she is like her husband

Bolette You mean has like interests

Lyngstrand Yes thats it

Bolette Well but his abilitieshis talentsand his skill

Lyngstrand HmwellI should like to know if all that too

Bolette Then perhaps you also believe that everything a man has read
for himself and thought out for himself that this too can grow upon
his wife

Lyngstrand Yes I think it can Little by little as by a sort of
miracle But of course I know such things can only happen in a
marriage that is faithful and loving and really happy

Bolette Has it never occurred to you that a man too might perhaps
be thus drawn over to his wife Grow like her I mean

Lyngstrand A man No I never thought of that

Bolette But why not one as well as the other

Lyngstrand No for a man has a calling that he lives for and thats
what makes a man so strong and firm Miss Wangel He has a calling in
life

Bolette Has every man

Lyngstrand Oh no I am thinking more especially of artists

Bolette Do you think it right of an artist to get married

Lyngstrand Yes I think so If he can find one he can heartily love
I

Bolette Still I think he should rather live for his art alone

Lyngstrand Of course he must but he can do that just as well even if
he marries

Bolette But how about her

Lyngstrand Her Who

Bolette She whom he marries What is she to live for

Lyngstrand She too is to live for his art It seems to me a woman
must feel so thoroughly happy in that

Bolette Hm I dont exactly know

Lyngstrand Yes Miss Wangel you may be sure of that It is not merely
all the honour and respect she enjoys through him for that seems almost
the least important to me But it is thisthat she can help him to
create that she can lighten his work for him be about him and see to
his comfort and tend him well and make his life thoroughly pleasant I
should think that must be perfectly delightful to a woman

Bolette Ah You dont yourself know how selfish you are

Lyngstrand I selfish Good heavens Oh if only you knew me a little
better than you do Bending closer to her Miss Wangel when once I am
goneand that will be very soon now

Bolette looks pityingly at him Oh dont think of anything so sad

Lyngstrand But really I dont think it is so very sad

Bolette What do you mean

Lyngstrand Well you know that I set out in a month First from here
and then of course Im going south

Bolette Oh I see Of course

Lyngstrand Will you think of me sometimes then Miss Wangel

Bolette Yes gladly

Lyngstrand pleased No promise

Bolette I promise

Lyngstrand By all that is sacred Miss Bolette

Bolette By all that is sacred In a changed manner Oh but what can
come of it all Nothing on earth can come of it

Lyngstrand How can you say that It would be so delightful for me to
know you were at home here thinking of me

Bolette Well and what else

Lyngstrand I dont exactly know of anything else

Bolette Nor I either There are so many things in the way Everything
stands in the way I think

Lyngstrand Oh another miracle might come about Some happy
dispensation of fortune or something of the sort for I really believe
I shall be lucky now

Bolette eagerly Really You do believe that

Lyngstrand Yes I believe it thoroughly And soafter a few
yearswhen I come home again as a celebrated sculptor and well off
and in perfect health

Bolette Yes yes Of course we will hope so

Lyngstrand You may be perfectly certain about it Only think faithfully
and kindly of me when I am down there in the south and now I have your
word that you will

Bolette You have shaking her head But all the same nothing will
surely come of it

Lyngstrand Oh yes Miss Bolette At least this will come of it I
shall get on so much more easily and quickly with my art work

Bolette Do you believe that too

Lyngstrand I have an inner conviction of it And I fancy it will be so
cheering for you toohere in this outoftheway placeto know within
yourself that you are so to say helping me to create

Bolette looking at him Well but you on your side

Lyngstrand I

Bolette looking out into the garden Hush Let us speak of something
else Heres Mr Arnholm

ARNHOLM is seen in the garden below He stops and talks to HILDE and
BALLESTED

Lyngstrand Are you fond of your old teacher Miss Bolette

Bolette Fond of him

Lyngstrand Yes I mean do you care for him

Bolette Yes indeed I do for he is a true friendand adviser
tooand then he is always so ready to help when he can

Lyngstrand Isnt it extraordinary that he hasnt married

Bolette Do you think it is extraordinary

Lyngstrand Yes for you say hes welltodo

Bolette He is certainly said to be so But probably it wasnt so easy
to find anyone whod have him

Lyngstrand Why

Bolette Oh Hes been the teacher of nearly all the young girls that he
knows He says that himself

Lyngstrand But what does that matter

Bolette Why good heavens One doesnt marry a man whos been your
teacher

Lyngstrand Dont you think a young girl might love her teacher

Bolette Not after shes really grown up

Lyngstrand Nofancy that

Bolette cautioning him Sh sh

Meanwhile BALLESTED has been gathering together his things and carries
them out from the garden to the right HILDE helps him ARNHOLM goes up
the verandah and comes into the room

Arnholm Goodmorning my dear Bolette Goodmorning MrMrhmHe
looks displeased and nods coldly to LYNGSTRAND who rises

Bolette rising up and going up to ARNHOLM Goodmorning Mr Arnholm

Arnholm Everything all right here today

Bolette Yes thanks quite

Arnholm Has your stepmother gone to bathe again today

Bolette No She is upstairs in her room

Arnholm Not very bright

Bolette I dont know for she has locked herself in

Arnholm Hmhas she

Lyngstrand I suppose Mrs Wangel was very much frightened about that
American yesterday

Arnholm What do you know about that

Lyngstrand I told Mrs Wangel that I had seen him in the flesh behind
the garden

Arnholm Oh I see

Bolette to ARNHOLM No doubt you and father sat up very late last
night talking

Arnholm Yes rather late We were talking over serious matters

Bolette Did you put in a word for me and my affairs too

Arnholm No dear Bolette I couldnt manage it He was so completely
taken up with something else

Bolette sighs Ah yes he always is

Arnholm looks at her meaningly But later on today well talk more
fully aboutthe matter Wheres your father now Not at home

Bolette Yes he is He must be down in the office Ill fetch him

Arnholm No thanks Dont do that Id rather go down to him

Bolette listening Wait one moment Mr Arnholm I believe thats
father on the stairs Yes I suppose hes been up to look after her

WANGEL comes in from the door on the left

Wangel shaking ARNHOLMS hand What dear friend are you here
already It was good of you to come so early for I should like to talk
a little further with you

Bolette to LYNGSTRAND Hadnt we better go down to Hilde in the
garden

Lyngstrand I shall be delighted Miss Wangel

He and BOLETTE go down into the garden and pass out between the trees
in the background

Arnholm following them with his eyes turns to WANGEL Do you know
anything about that young man

Wangel No nothing at all

Arnholm But do you think it right he should knock about so much with
the girls

Wangel Does he I really hadnt noticed it

Arnholm You ought to see to it I think

Wangel Yes I suppose youre right But good Lord Whats a man to
do The girls are so accustomed to look after themselves now They wont
listen to me nor to Ellida

Arnholm Not to her either

Wangel No and besides I really cannot expect Ellida to trouble about
such things Shes not fit for that breaking off But it wasnt that
which we were to talk of Now tell me have you thought the matter
overthought over all I told you of

Arnholm I have thought of nothing else ever since we parted last night

Wangel And what do you think should be done

Arnholm Dear Wangel I think you as a doctor must know that better
than I

Wangel Oh if you only knew how difficult it is for a doctor to judge
rightly about a patient who is so dear to him Besides this is no
ordinary illness No ordinary doctor and no ordinary medicines can help
her

Arnholm How is she today

Wangel I was upstairs with her just now and then she seemed to me
quite calm but behind all her moods something lies hidden which it
is impossible for me to fathom and then she is so changeable so
capriciousshe varies so suddenly

Arnholm No doubt that is the result of her morbid state of mind

Wangel Not altogether When you go down to the bedrock it was born in
her Ellida belongs to the seafolk That is the matter

Arnholm What do you really mean my dear doctor

Wangel Havent you noticed that the people from out there by the open
sea are in a way a people apart It is almost as if they themselves
lived the life of the sea There is the rush of waves and ebb and flow
too both in their thoughts and in their feelings and so they can never
bear transplanting Oh I ought to have remembered that It was a sin
against Ellida to take her away from there and bring her here

Arnholm You have come to that opinion

Wangel Yes more and more But I ought to have told myself this
beforehand Oh I knew it well enough at bottom But I put it from me
For you see I loved her so Therefore I thought of myself first of
all I was inexcusably selfish at that time

Arnholm Hm I suppose every man is a little selfish under such
circumstances Moreover Ive never noticed that vice in you Doctor
Wangel

Wangel walks uneasily about the room Oh yes And I have been since
then too Why I am so much much older than she is I ought to have
been at once as a father to her and a guide I ought to have done my
best to develop and enlighten her mind Unfortunately nothing ever came
of that You see I hadnt stamina enough for I preferred her just as
she was So things went worse and worse with her and then I didnt
know what to do In a lower voice That was why I wrote to you in my
trouble and asked you to come here

Arnholm looks at him in astonishment What was it for this you wrote

Wangel Yes but dont let anyone notice anything

Arnholm How on earth dear doctorwhat good did you expect me to be I
dont understand it

Wangel No naturally For I was on an altogether false track I thought
Ellidas heart had at one time gone out to you and that she still
secretly cared for you a littlethat perhaps it would do her good to
see you again and talk of her home and the old days

Arnholm So it was your wife you meant when you wrote that she expected
me andand perhaps longed for me

Wangel Yes who else

Arnholm hurriedly No no Youre right But I didnt understand

Wangel Naturally as I said for I was on an absolutely wrong track

Arnholm And you call yourself selfish

Wangel Ah but I had such a great sin to atone for I felt I dared not
neglect any means that might give the slightest relief to her mind

Arnholm How do you really explain the power this stranger exercises
over her

Wangel Hmdear friendthere may be sides to the matter that cannot be
explained

Arnholm Do you mean anything inexplicable in itselfabsolutely
inexplicable

Wangel In any case not explicable as far as we know

Arnholm Do you believe there is something in it then

Wangel I neither believe nor deny I simply dont know Thats why I
leave it alone

Arnholm Yes But just one thing her extraordinary weird assertion
about the childs eyes

Wangel eagerly I dont believe a word about the eyes I will not
believe such a thing It must be purely fancy on her part nothing else

Arnholm Did you notice the mans eyes when you saw him yesterday

Wangel Of course I did

Arnholm And you saw no sort of resemblance

Wangel evasively Hmgood heavens What shall I say It wasnt quite
light when I saw him and besides Ellida had been saying so much about
this resemblance I really dont know if I was capable of observing
quite impartially

Arnholm Well well may be But that other matter All this terror and
unrest coming upon her at the very time as it seems this strange man
was on his way home

Wangel Thatoh thats something she must have persuaded and dreamed
herself into since it happened She was not seized with this so
suddenlyall at onceas she now maintains But since she heard from
young Lyngstrand that Johnstonor Friman or whatever his name iswas
on his way hither three years ago in the month of March she now
evidently believes her unrest of mind came upon her at that very time

Arnholm It was not so then

Wangel By no means There were signs and symptoms of it before this
time though it did happen by chance that in that month of March
three years ago she had a rather severe attack

Arnholm After all then

Wangel Yes but that is easily accounted for by the circumstancesthe
condition she happened to be in at the time

Arnholm So symptom for symptom then

Wangel wringing his hands And not to be able to help her Not to know
how to counsel her To see no way

Arnholm Now if you could make up your mind to leave this place to go
somewhere else so that she could live amid surroundings that would seem
more homelike to her

Wangel Ah dear friend Do you think I havent offered her that too I
suggested moving out to Skjoldviken but she will not

Arnholm Not that either

Wangel No for she doesnt think it would be any good and perhaps
shes right

Arnholm Hm Do you say that

Wangel Moreover when I think it all over carefully I really dont
know how I could manage it I dont think I should be justified for the
sake of the girls in going away to such a desolate place After
all they must live where there is at least a prospect of their being
provided for someday

Arnholm Provided for Are you thinking about that already

Wangel Heaven knows I must think of that too But then on the other
hand again my poor sick Ellida Oh dear Arnholm in many respects I
seem to be standing between fire and water

Arnholm Perhaps youve no need to worry on Bolettes account Breaking
off I should like to know where shewhere they have gone Goes up to
the open door and looks out

Wangel Oh I would so gladly make any sacrifice for all three of them
if only I knew what

ELLIDA enters from the door on the left

Ellida quickly to WANGEL Be sure you dont go out this morning

Wangel No no of course not I will stay at home with you Pointing
to ARNHOLM who is coming towards them But wont you speak to our
friend

Ellida turning Oh are you here Mr Arnholm Holding out her hand
to him Goodmorning

Arnholm Goodmorning Mrs Wangel So youve not been bathing as usual
today

Ellida No no no That is out of the question today But wont you sit
down a moment

Arnholm No thanks not now Looks at WANGEL I promised the girls to
go down to them in the garden

Ellida Goodness knows if youll find them there I never know where
they may be rambling

Wangel Theyre sure to be down by the pond

Arnholm Oh I shall find them right enough Nods and goes out across
the verandah into the garden

Ellida What time is it Wangel

Wangel looking at his watch A little past eleven

Ellida A little past And at eleven oclock or halfpast eleven
tonight the steamer is coming If only that were over

Wangel going nearer to her Dear Ellida there is one thing I should
like to ask you

Ellida What is it

Wangel The evening before lastup at the Viewyou said that during
the last three years you had so often seen him bodily before you

Ellida And so I have You may believe that

Wangel But how did you see him

Ellida How did I see him

Wangel I mean how did he look when you thought you saw him

Ellida But dear Wangel why you now know yourself how he looks

Wangel Did he look exactly like that in your imagination

Ellida He did

Wangel Exactly the same as you saw him in reality yesterday evening

Ellida Yes exactly

Wangel Then how was it you did not at once recognise him

Ellida Did I not

Wangel No you said yourself afterwards that at first you did not at
all know who the strange man was

Ellida perplexed I really believe you are right Dont you think that
strange Wangel Fancy my not knowing him at once

Wangel It was only the eyes you said

Ellida Oh yes The eyesthe eyes

Wangel Well but at the View you said that he always appeared to you
exactly as he was when you parted out thereten years ago

Ellida Did I

Wangel Yes

Ellida Then I suppose he did look much as he does now

Wangel No On our way home the day before yesterday you gave quite
another description of him Ten years ago he had no beard you said
His dress too was quite different And that breastpin with the pearl
That man yesterday wore nothing of the sort

Ellida No he did not

Wangel looks searchingly at her Now just think a little dear Ellida
Or perhaps you cant quite remember how he looked when he stood by you
at Bratthammer

Ellida thoughtfully closing her eyes for a moment Not quite
distinctly No today I cant Is it not strange

Wangel Not so very strange after all You have now been confronted by a
new and real image and that overshadows the old one so that you can no
longer see it

Ellida Do you believe that Wangel

Wangel Yes And it overshadows your sick imaginings too That is why
it is good a reality has come

Ellida Good Do you think it good

Wangel Yes That it has come It may restore you to health

Ellida sitting down on sofa Wangel come and sit down by me I must
tell you all my thoughts

Wangel Yes do dear Ellida

He sits down on a chair on the other side of the table

Ellida It was really a great misfortunefor us boththat we two of
all people should have come together

Wangel amazed What are you saying

Ellida Oh yes it was And its so natural It could bring nothing but
unhappiness after the way in which we came together

Wangel What was there in that way

Ellida Listen Wangel its no use going on lying to ourselves and to
one another

Wangel Are we doing so Lying you say

Ellida Yes we are or at least we suppress the truth For the
truththe pure and simple truth isthat you came out there and bought
me

Wangel Boughtyou say bought

Ellida Oh I wasnt a bit better than you I accepted the bargain Sold
myself to you

Wangel looks at her full of pain Ellida have you really the heart to
call it that

Ellida But is there any other name for it You could no longer bear the
emptiness of your house You were on the lookout for a new wife

Wangel And a new mother for the children Ellida

Ellida That too perhaps by the way although you didnt in the least
know if I were fit for the position Why you had only seen me and
spoken to me a few times Then you wanted me and so

Wangel Yes you may call it as you will

Ellida And I on my sidewhy I was so helpless and bewildered and
so absolutely alone Oh it was so natural I should accept the bargain
when you came and proposed to provide for me all my life

Wangel Assuredly it did not seem to me a providing for you dear
Ellida I asked you honestly if you would share with me and the children
the little I could call my own

Ellida Yes you did but all the same I should never have accepted
Never have accepted that at any price Not sold myself Better the
meanest workbetter the poorest lifeafter ones own choice

Wangel rising Then have the fivesix years that we have lived
together been so utterly worthless to you

Ellida Oh Dont think that Wangel I have been as well cared for here
as human being could desire But I did not enter your house freely That
is the thing

Wangel looking at her Not freely

Ellida No It was not freely that I went with you

Wangel in subdued tone Ah I remember your words of yesterday

Ellida It all lies in those words They have enlightened me and so I
see it all now

Wangel What do you see

Ellida I see that the life we two live togetheris really no marriage

Wangel bitterly You have spoken truly there The life we now live is
not a marriage

Ellida Nor was it formerly Nevernot from the very first looks
straight in front of her The firstthat might have been a complete
and real marriage

Wangel The firstwhat do you mean

Ellida Minewith him

Wangel looks at her in astonishment I do not in the least understand
you

Ellida Ah dear Wangel let us not lie to one another nor to
ourselves

Wangel Wellwhat more

Ellida You seewe can never get away from that one thingthat a
freely given promise is fully as binding as a marriage

Wangel But what on earth

Ellida rising impetuously Set me free Wangel

Wangel Ellida Ellida

Ellida Yes yes Oh grant me that Believe me it will come to that
all the sameafter the way we two came together

Wangel conquering his pain It has come to this then

Ellida It has come to this It could not be otherwise

Wangel looking gloomily at her So I have not won you by our living
together Never never possessed you quite

Ellida Ah Wangelif only I could love you how gladly I wouldas
dearly as you deserve But I feel it so wellthat will never be

Wangel Divorce then It is a divorce a complete legal divorce that
you want

Ellida Dear you understand me so little I care nothing for such
formalities Such outer things matter nothing I think What I want is
that we should of our own free will release each other

Wangel bitterly nods slowly To cry off the bargain againyes

Ellida quickly Exactly To cry off the bargain

Wangel And then Ellida Afterwards Have you reflected what life would
be to both of us What life would be to both you and me

Ellida No matter Things must turn out afterwards as they may What I
beg and implore of you Wangel is the most important Only set me free
Give me back my complete freedom

Wangel Ellida it is a fearful thing you ask of me At least give me
time to collect myself before I come to a decision Let us talk it over
more carefully And you yourselftake time to consider what you are
doing

Ellida But we have no time to lose with such matters I must have my
freedom again today

Wangel Why today

Ellida Because he is coming tonight

Wangel starts Coming He What has this stranger to do with it

Ellida I want to face him in perfect freedom

Wangel And whatwhat else do you intend to do

Ellida I will not hide behind the fact that I am the wife of another
man nor make the excuse that I have no choice for then it would be no
decision

Wangel You speak of a choice Choice Ellida A choice in such a
matter

Ellida Yes I must be free to chooseto choose for either side I must
be able to let him go awayalone or to go with him

Wangel Do you know what you are saying Go with himgive your whole
life into his hands

Ellida Didnt I give my life into your hands and without any ado

Wangel Maybe But he He an absolute stranger A man of whom you know
so little

Ellida Ah but after all I knew you even less and yet I went with you

Wangel Then you knew to some extent what life lay before you But now
Think What do you know You know absolutely nothing Not even who or
what he is

Ellida looking in front of her That is true but that is the terror

Wangel Yes indeed it is terrible

Ellida That is why I feel I must plunge into it

Wangel looking at her Because it seems terrible

Ellida Yes because of that

Wangel coming closer Listen Ellida What do you really mean by
terrible

Ellida reflectively The terrible is that which repels and attracts

Wangel Attracts you say

Ellida Attracts most of all I think

Wangel slowly You are one with the sea

Ellida That too is a terror

Wangel And that terror is in you You both repel and attract

Ellida Do you think so Wangel

Wangel After all I have never really known younever really Now I am
beginning to understand

Ellida And that is why you must set me free Free me from every bond to
youand yours I am not what you took me for Now you see it yourself
Now we can part as friendsand freely

Wangel sadly Perhaps it would be better for us both if we partedAnd
yet I cannot You are the terror to me Ellida the attraction is what
is strongest in you

Ellida Do you say that

Wangel Let us try and live through this day wiselyin perfect quiet
of mind I dare not set you free and release you today I have no right
to No right for your own sake Ellida I exercise my right and my duty
to protect you

Ellida Protect What is there to protect me from I am not threatened
by any outward power The terror lies deeper Wangel The terror isthe
attraction in my own mind And what can you do against that

Wangel I can strengthen and urge you to fight against it

Ellida Yes if I wished to fight against it

Wangel Then you do not wish to

Ellida Oh I dont know myself

Wangel Tonight all will be decided dear EllidaEllida bursting out
Yes think The decision so nearthe decision for ones whole life

Wangel And then tomorrowEllida Tomorrow Perhaps my real future will
have been ruined

Wangel Your realEllida The whole full life of freedom lostlost
for me and perhaps for him also

Wangel in a lower tone seizing her wrist Ellida do you love this
stranger

Ellida Do I Oh how can I tell I only know that to me he is a terror
and that

Wangel And that

Ellida tearing herself away And that it is to him I think I belong

Wangel bowing his head I begin to understand better

Ellida And what remedy have you for that What advice to give me

Wangel looking sadly at her Tomorrow he will be gone then the
misfortune will be averted from your head and then I will consent to
set you free We will cry off the bargain tomorrow Ellida

Ellida Ah Wangel tomorrow That is too late

Wangel looking towards garden The childrenthe children Let us
spare them at least for the present

ARNHOLM BOLETTE HILDE and LYNGSTRAND come into the garden
LYNGSTRAND says goodbye in the garden and goes out The rest come into
the room

Arnholm You must know we have been making plans

Hilde Were going out to the fjord tonight and

Bolette No you mustnt tell

Wangel We two also have been making plans

Arnholm Ahreally

Wangel Tomorrow Ellida is going away to Skjoldviken for a time

Bolette Going away

Arnholm Now look here thats very sensible Mrs Wangel

Wangel Ellida wants to go home againhome to the sea

Hilde springing towards ELLIDA You are going awayaway from us

Ellida frightened Hilde What is the matter

Hilde controlling herself Oh its nothing In a low voice turning
from her Are only you going

Arnholm whispers We will talk it over later Bolette He crosses to

Ellida aside to BOLETTE What was the matter with Hilde She looked
quite scared

Bolette Have you never noticed what Hilde goes about here day in day
out hungering for

Ellida Hungering for

Bolette Ever since you came into the house

Ellida No no What is it

Bolette One loving word from you

Ellida Oh If there should be something for me to do here

She clasps her hands together over her head and looks fixedly in
front of her as if torn by contending thoughts and emotions WANGEL and
ARNHOLM come across the room whispering BOLETTE goes to the side room
and looks in Then she throws open the door

Bolette Father dearthe table is laidif you

Wangel with forced composure Is it child Thats well Come
Arnholm Well go in and drink a farewell cupwith the Lady from the
Sea They go out through the right




ACT V

SCENEThe distant part of DOCTOR WANGELS garden and the carp pond
The summer night gradually darkens

ARNHOLM BOLETTE LYNGSTRAND and HILDE are in a boat punting along the
shore to the left

Hilde See We can jump ashore easily here

Arnholm No no dont

Lyngstrand I cant jump Miss Hilde

Hilde Cant you jump either Arnholm

Arnholm Id rather not try

Bolette Then lets land down there by the bathing steps

They push off At the same moment BALLESTED comes along the footpath
carrying musicbooks and a French horn He bows to those in the boat
turns and speaks to them The answers are heard farther and farther
away

Ballested What do you say Yes of course its on account of the
English steamer for this is her last visit here this year But if
you want to enjoy the pleasures of melody you mustnt wait too long
Calling out What Shaking his head Cant hear what you say

ELLIDA with a shawl over her head enters followed by DOCTOR WANGEL

Wangel But dear Ellida I assure you theres plenty of time

Ellida No no there is not He may come any moment

Ballested outside the fence Hallo Goodevening doctor
Goodevening Mrs Wangel

Wangel noticing him Oh is it you Is there to be music tonight

Ballested Yes the Wind Band Society thought of making themselves
heard Weve no dearth of festive occasions nowadays Tonight its in
honour of the English ship

Ellida The English ship Is she in sight already

Ballested Not yet But you know she comes from between the islands You
cant see anything of her and then shes alongside of you

Ellida Yes that is so

Wangel half to ELLIDA Tonight is the last voyage then she will not
come again

Ballested A sad thought doctor and thats why were going to give
them an ovation as the saying is Ah Yesah yes The glad summertime
will soon be over now Soon all ways will be barred as they say in the
tragedy

Ellida All ways barredyes

Ballested Its sad to think of We have been the joyous children of
summer for weeks and months now Its hard to reconcile yourself to
the dark daysjust at first I mean For men can accliaacclimatise
themselves Mrs Wangel Ay indeed they can Bows and goes off to the
left

Ellida looking out at the fjord Oh this terrible suspense This
torturing last halfhour before the decision

Wangel You are determined then to speak to him yourself

Ellida I must speak to him myself for it is freely that I must make my
choice

Wangel You have no choice Ellida You have no right to chooseno
right without my permission

Ellida You can never prevent the choice neither you nor anyone You
can forbid me to go away with himto follow himin case I should
choose to do that You can keep me here by forceagainst my will That
you can do But that I should choose choose from my very soulchoose
him and not youin case I would and did choose thusthis you cannot
prevent

Wangel No you are right I cannot prevent that

Ellida And so I have nothing to help me to resist Here at home there
is no single thing that attracts me and binds me I am so absolutely
rootless in your house Wangel The children are not minetheir hearts
I meannever have been When I go if I do go either with him tonight
or to Skjoldviken tomorrow I havent a key to give up an order to give
about anything whatsoever I am absolutely rootless in your houseI
have been absolutely outside everything from the very first

Wangel You yourself wished it

Ellida No no I did not I neither wished nor did not wish it I
simply left things just as I found them the day I came here It is you
and no one else who wished it

Wangel I thought to do all for the best for you

Ellida Yes Wangel I know it so well But there is retribution in
that a something that avenges itself For now I find no binding power
herenothing to strengthen menothing to help menothing to draw me
towards what should have been the strongest possession of us both

Wangel I see it Ellida And that is why from tmorrow you shall have
back your freedom Henceforth you shall live your own life

Ellida And you call that my own life No My own true life lost its
bearings when I agreed to live with you Clenches her hand in fear
and unrest And nowtonightin half an hour he whom I forsook is
cominghe to whom I should have cleaved forever even as he has cleaved
to me Now he is coming to offer mefor the last and only timethe
chance of living my life over again of living my own true lifethe
life that terrifies and attractsand I can not forgo thatnot freely

Wangel That is why it is necessary your husbandand your
doctorshould take the power of acting from you and act on your
behalf

Ellida Yes Wangel I quite understand Believe me there are times
when I think it would be peace and deliverance if with all my soul
I could be bound to youand try to brave all that terrifiesand
attracts But I cannot No no I cannot do that

Wangel Come Ellida let us walk up and down together for awhile

Ellida I would gladlybut I dare not For he said I was to wait for
him here

Wangel Come There is time enough

Ellida Do you think so

Wangel Plenty of time I tell you

Ellida Then let us go for a little while

They pass out in the foreground At the same time ARNHOLM and BOLETTE
appear by the upper bank of the pond

Bolette noticing the two as they go out See there

Arnholm in low voice Hush Let them go Bolette Can you understand
what has been going on between them these last few days

Arnholm Have you noticed anything

Bolette Have I not

Arnholm Anything peculiar

Bolette Yes one thing and another Havent you

Arnholm WellI dont exactly know

Bolette Yes you have only you wont speak out about it

Arnholm I think it will do your stepmother good to go on this little
journey

Bolette Do you think so

Arnholm I should say it would be well for all parties that she should
get away every now and then

Bolette If she does go home to Skjoldviken tomorrow she will never
come back here again

Arnholm My dear Bolette whatever makes you think that

Bolette I am quite convinced of it Just you wait youll see that
shell not come back again not anyhow as long as I and Hilde are in the
house here

Arnholm Hilde too

Bolette Well it might perhaps be all right with Hilde For she is
scarcely more than a child And I believe that at bottom she worships
Ellida But you see its different with mea stepmother who isnt so
very much older than oneself

Arnholm Dear Bolette perhaps it might after all not be so very long
before you left

Bolette eagerly Really Have you spoken to father about it

Arnholm Yes I have

Bolette Well what does he say

Arnholm Hm Well your fathers so thoroughly taken up with other
matters just now

Bolette Yes yes thats how I knew it would be

Arnholm But I got this much out of him You mustnt reckon upon any
help from him

Bolette No

Arnholm He explained his circumstances to me clearly he thought that
such a thing was absolutely out of the question impossible for him

Bolette reproachfully And you had the heart to come and mock me

Arnholm Ive certainly not done that dear Bolette It depends wholly
and solely upon yourself whether you go away or not

Bolette What depends upon me

Arnholm Whether you are to go out into the worldlearn all you most
care fortake part in all you are hungering after here at homelive
your life under brighter conditions Bolette

Bolette clasping her hands together Good God But its impossible If
father neither can nor willand I have no one else on earth to whom I
could turnArnholm Couldnt you make up your mind to accept a little
help from your oldfrom your former teacher

Bolette From you Mr Arnholm Would you be willing to

Arnholm Stand by you Yeswith all my heart Both with word and in
deed You may count upon it Then you accept Well Do you agree

Bolette Do I agree To get awayto see the worldto learn something
thoroughly All that seemed to be a great beautiful impossibility

Arnholm All that may now become a reality to you if only you yourself
wish it

Bolette And to all this unspeakable happiness you will help me Oh no
Tell me can I accept such an offer from a stranger

Arnholm You can from me Bolette From me you can accept anything

Bolette seizing his hands Yes I almost think I can I dont know how
it is butbursting out Oh I could both laugh and cry for joy for
happiness Then I should know life really after all I began to be so
afraid life would pass me by

Arnholm You need not fear that Bolette But now you must tell me quite
franklyif there is anythinganything you are bound to here

Bolette Bound to Nothing

Arnholm Nothing whatever

Bolette No nothing at all That isI am bound to father to some
extent And to Hilde too But

Arnholm Well youll have to leave your father sooner or later
And some time Hilde also will go her own way in life That is only a
question of time Nothing more And so there is nothing else that binds
you Bolette Not any kind of connection

Bolette Nothing whatever As far as that goes I could leave at any
moment

Arnholm Well if that is so dear Bolette you shall go away with me

Bolette clapping her hands Oh God What joy to think of it

Arnholm For I hope you trust me fully

Bolette Indeed I do

Arnholm And you dare to trust yourself and your future fully and
confidently into my hands Bolette Is that true You will dare to do
this

Bolette Of course how could I not do so Could you believe anything
else You who have been my old teachermy teacher in the old days I
mean

Arnholm Not because of that I will not consider that side of the
matter butwell so you are free Bolette There is nothing that binds
you and so I ask you if you couldif you couldbind yourself to me
for life

Bolette steps back frightened What are you saying

Arnholm For all your life Bolette Will you be my wife

Bolette half to herself No no no That is impossible utterly
impossible

Arnholm It is really so absolutely impossible for you to

Bolette But surely you cannot mean what you are saying Mr Arnholm
Looking at him Oryetwas that what you meant when you offered to
do so much for me

Arnholm You must listen to me one moment Bolette I suppose I have
greatly surprised you

Bolette Oh how could such a thing from youhow could it butbut
surprise me

Arnholm Perhaps you are right Of course you didntyou could not
know it was for your sake I made this journey

Bolette Did you come here forfor my sake

Arnholm I did Bolette In the spring I received a letter from your
father and in it there was a passage that made me thinkhmthat you
held your former teacher inin a little more than friendly remembrance

Bolette How could father write such a thing

Arnholm He did not mean it so But I worked myself into the belief
that here was a young girl longing for me to come againNo you mustnt
interrupt me dear Bolette Andyou see when a man like myself who
is no longer quite young has such a beliefor fancy it makes an
overwhelming impression There grew within me a living a grateful
affection for you I thought I must come to you see you again and tell
you I shared the feelings that I fancied you had for me

Bolette And now you know it is not sothat it was a mistake

Arnholm It cant be helped Bolette Your image as I bear it within
myself will always be coloured and stamped with the impression that
this mistake gave me Perhaps you cannot understand this but still it
is so

Bolette I never thought such a thing possible

Arnholm But now you have seen that it is possible what do you say now
Bolette Couldnt you make up your mind to beyesto be my wife

Bolette Oh it seems so utterly impossible Mr Arnholm You who have
been my teacher I cant imagine ever standing in any other relation
towards you

Arnholm Well well if you think you really cannotThen our old
relations remain unchanged dear Bolette

Bolette What do you mean

Arnholm Of course to keep my promise all the same I will take care
you get out into the world and see something of it Learn some things
you really want to know live safe and independent Your future I
shall provide for also Bolette For in me you will always have a good
faithful trustworthy friend Be sure of that

Bolette Good heavens Mr Arnholm all that is so utterly impossible
now

Arnholm Is that impossible too

Bolette Surely you can see that After what you have just said to me
and after my answerOh you yourself must see that it is impossible
for me now to accept so very much from you I can accept nothing from
younothing after this

Arnholm So you would rather stay at home here and let life pass you
by

Bolette Oh it is such dreadful misery to think of that

Arnholm Will you renounce knowing something of the outer world
Renounce bearing your part in all that you yourself say you are
hungering for To know there is so infinitely much and yet never really
to understand anything of it Think carefully Bolette

Bolette Yes yes You are right Mr Arnholm

Arnholm And then when one day your father is no longer here then
perhaps to be left helpless and alone in the world or live to give
yourself to another manwhom you perhaps will also feel no affection
for

Bolette Oh yes I see how true all you say is But stilland yet
perhaps

Arnholm quickly Well

Bolette looking at him hesitatingly Perhaps it might not be so
impossible after all

Arnholm What Bolette

Bolette Perhaps it might be possibleto acceptwhat you proposed to
me

Arnholm Do you mean that after all you might be willing tothat at
all events you could give me the happiness of helping you as a steadfast
friend

Bolette No no no Never that for that would be utterly impossible
now NoMr Arnholmrather take me

Arnholm Bolette You will

Bolette Yes I believe I will

Arnholm And after all you will be my wife

Bolette Yes if you still think thatthat you will have me

Arnholm Think Seizing her hand Oh thanks thanks Bolette All
else that you saidyour former doubtsthese do not frighten me If I
do not yet possess your whole heart I shall know how to conquer it Oh
Bolette I will wait upon you hand and foot

Bolette And then I shall see something of the world Shall live You
have promised me that

Arnholm And will keep my promise

Bolette And I may learn everything I want to

Arnholm I myself will be your teacher as formerly Bolette Do you
remember the last school year

Bolette quietly and absently To thinkto knowones self free and
to get out into the strange world and then not to need to be anxious
for the futurenot to be harassed about ones stupid livelihood

Arnholm No you will never need to waste a thought upon such matters
And thats a good thing too in its way dear Bolette isnt it Eh

Bolette Indeed it is That is certain

Arnholm putting his arms about her Oh you will see how comfortably
and easily we shall settle down together And how well and safely and
trustfully we two shall get on with one another Bolette

Bolette Yes I also begin toI believe reallyit will answer Looks
out to the right and hurriedly frees herself Oh dont say anything
about this

Arnholm What is it dear

Bolette Oh its that poor pointingsee out there

Arnholm Is it your father

Bolette No Its the young sculptor Hes down there with Hilde

Arnholm Oh Lyngstrand Whats really the matter with him

Bolette Why you know how weak and delicate he is

Arnholm Yes Unless its simply imaginary

Bolette No its real enough Hell not last long But perhaps thats
best for him

Arnholm Dear why should that be best

Bolette Becausebecausenothing would come of his art anyhow Lets
go before they come

Arnholm Gladly my dear Bolette

HILDE and LYNGSTRAND appear by the pond

Hilde Hi hi Wont your honours wait for us

Arnholm Bolette and I would rather go on a little in advance He and
BOLETTE go out to the Left

Lyngstrand laughs quietly Its very delightful here now Everybody
goes about in pairsalways two and two together

Hilde looking after them I could almost swear hes proposing to her

Lyngstrand Really Have you noticed anything

Hilde Yes Its not very difficultif you keep your eyes open

Lyngstrand But Miss Bolette wont have him Im certain of that

Hilde No For she thinks hes got so dreadfully oldlooking and she
thinks hell soon get bald

Lyngstrand Its not only because of that Shed not have him anyhow

Hilde How can you know

Lyngstrand Well because theres someone else shes promised to think
of

Hilde Only to think of

Lyngstrand While he is away yes

Hilde Oh then I suppose its you shes to think of

Lyngstrand Perhaps it might be

Hilde She promised you that

Lyngstrand Yesthinkshe promised me that But mind you dont tell
her you know

Hilde Oh Ill be mum Im as secret as the grave

Lyngstrand I think its awfully kind of her

Hilde And when you come home againare you going to be engaged to her
and then marry her

Lyngstrand No that wouldnt very well do For I darent think of such
a thing during the first years And when I shall be able to shell be
rather too old for me I fancy

Hilde And yet you wish her to think of you

Lyngstrand Yes thats so useful to me You see Im an artist And she
can very well do it because she herself has no real calling But all
the same its kind of her

Hilde Do you think youll be able to get on more quickly with your work
if you know that Bolette is here thinking of you

Lyngstrand Yes I fancy so To know there is a spot on earth where a
young gentle reserved woman is quietly dreaming about youI fancy it
must be sosowell I really dont exactly know what to call it

Hilde Perhaps you meanfascinating

Lyngstrand Fascinating Oh yes Fascinating was what I meant or
something like it Looks at her for a moment You are so clever Miss
Hilde Really you are very clever When I come home again youll be
about the same age as your sister is now Perhaps too youll look like
your sister looks now And perhaps too youll be of the same mind she
is now Then perhaps youll be both yourself and your sisterin one
form so to say

Hilde Would you like that

Lyngstrand I hardly know Yes I almost think I should But now for
this summer I would rather you were like yourself alone and exactly as
you are

Hilde Do you like me best as I am

Lyngstrand Yes I like you immensely as you are

Hilde Hm Tell me you who are an artist do you think Im right always
to wear brightcoloured summer dresses

Lyngstrand Yes I think youre quite right

Hilde You think bright colours suit me then

Lyngstrand They suit you charminglyto my taste

Hilde But tell me as an artist how do you think I should look in
black

Lyngstrand In black Miss Hilde

Hilde Yes all in black Do you think I should look well

Lyngstrand Blacks hardly suitable for the summer However youd
probably look remarkably well in black especially with your appearance

Hilde looking straight in front of her All in black up to the
throat black frilling round that black gloves and a long black veil
hanging down behind

Lyngstrand If you were dressed so Miss Hilde I should wish I were a
painter and Id paint you as a young beautiful sorrowing widow

Hilde Or as a young sorrowing betrothed girl

Lyngstrand Yes that would be better still But you cant wish to be
dressed like that

Hilde I hardly know but I think its fascinating

Lyngstrand Fascinating

Hilde Fascinating to think of yes Suddenly pointing to the left
Oh just look there

Lyngstrand looking The great English steamer and right by the pier

WANGEL and ELLIDA come in past the pond

Wangel No I assure you dear Ellida you are mistaken Seeing the
others What are you two here Its not in sight yet is it Mr
Lyngstrand

Lyngstrand The great English ship

Wangel Yes

Lyngstrand pointing There she is already doctor

Ellida I knew it

Wangel Come

Lyngstrand Come like a thief in the night as one might say so quietly
and noiselessly

Wangel You must go to the pier with Hilde Be quick Im sure she wants
to hear the music

Lyngstrand Yes we were just going there doctor

Wangel Perhaps well follow you Well come directly

Hilde whispering to LYNGSTRAND Theyre hunting in couples too

HILDE and LYNGSTRAND go out through the garden Music is heard in the
distance out at the fiord during the following

Ellida Come He is here Yes yesI feel it

Wangel Youd better go in Ellida Let me talk with him alone

Ellida Oh thats impossibleimpossible I say With a cry Ah do
you see him Wangel

The STRANGER enters from the left and remains on the pathway outside
the fence

The Stranger bowing Goodevening You see I am here again Ellida

Ellida Yes yes The time has come now

The Stranger And are you ready to start or not

Wangel You can see for yourself that she is not

The Stranger Im not asking about a travelling dress or anything of
that kind nor about packed trunks All that is needed for a journey I
have with me on board Ive also secured a cabin for her To ELLIDA
So I ask you if you are ready to go with me to go with mefreely

Ellida Oh do not ask me Do not tempt me

A ships bell is heard in the distance

The Stranger That is the first bell for going on board Now you must
say Yes or No

Ellida wringing her hands To decidedecide for ones whole life
Never to be able to undo it again

The Stranger Never In half an hour it will be too late

Ellida looking shyly and searchingly at him Why is it you hold to me
so resolutely

The Stranger Dont you feel as I do that we two belong together

Ellida Do you mean because of the vow

The Stranger Vows bind no one neither man nor woman If I hold so
steadfastly to you it is because I cannot do otherwise

Ellida in a low trembling voice Why didnt you come before

Wangel Ellida

Ellida bursting out Ah All that attracts and tempts and lures into
the unknown All the strength of the sea concentrated in this one thing

The STRANGER climbs over the fence

Ellida stepping back to WANGEL What is it What do you want

The Stranger I see it and I hear it in you Ellida After all you will
choose me in the end

Wangel going towards him My wife has no choice here I am here both
to choose for her and to defend her Yes defend If you do not go away
from hereaway from this landand never come back againDo you know
to what you are exposing yourself

Ellida No no Wangel not that

The Stranger What will you do to me

Wangel I will have you arrested as a criminal at once before you go
on board for I know all about the murder at Skjoldviken

Ellida Ah Wangel how can you

The Stranger I was prepared for that and sotakes a revolver from
his breast pocketI provided myself with this

Ellida throwing herself in front of him No no do not kill him
Better kill me

The Stranger Neither you nor him dont fear that This is for myself
for I will live and die a free man

Ellida with growing excitement Wangel let me tell you thistell it
you so that he may hear it You can indeed keep me here You have the
means and the power to do it And you intend to do it But my mindall
my thoughts all the longings and desires of my soulthese you cannot
bind These will rush and press out into the unknown that I was created
for and that you have kept from me

Wangel in quiet sorrow I see it Ellida Step by step you are
slipping from me The craving for the boundless the infinite the
unattainable will drive your soul into the darkness of night at last

Ellida Yes I feel it hovering over me like black noiseless wings

Wangel It shall not come to that No other deliverance is possible for
you I at least can see no other And soso I cry off our bargain at
once Now you can choose your own path in perfectperfect freedom

Ellida stares at him a while as if stricken dumb Is it truetrue
what you say Do you mean thatmean it with all your heart

Wangel Yeswith all my sorrowing heartI mean it

Ellida And can you do it Can you let it be so

Wangel Yes I can Because I love you so dearly

Ellida in a low trembling voice And have I come so nearso close to
you

Wangel The years and the living together have done that

Ellida clasping her hands together And Iwho so little understood
this

Wangel Your thoughts went elsewhere And nownow you are completely
free of me and mineandand mine Now your own true life may resume
its real bent again for now you can choose in freedom and on your own
responsibility Ellida

Ellida clasps her head with her hands and stares at WANGEL In
freedom and on my own responsibility Responsibility too That changes
everything

The ship bell rings again

The Stranger Do you hear Ellida It has rung now for the last time
Come

Ellida turns towards him looks firmly at him and speaks in a resolute
voice I shall never go with you after this

The Stranger You will not

Ellida clinging to WANGEL I shall never go away from you after this

The Stranger So it is over

Ellida Yes Over for all time

The Stranger I see There is something here stronger than my will

Ellida Your will has not a shadow of power over me any longer To me
you are as one deadwho has come home from the sea and who returns to
it again I no longer dread you And I am no longer drawn to you

The Stranger Goodbye Mrs Wangel He swings himself over the fence
Henceforth you are nothing but a shipwreck in my life that I have tided
over He goes out

Wangel looks at her for a while Ellida your mind is like the seait
has ebb and flow Whence came the change

Ellida Ah dont you understand that the change camewas bound to come
when I could choose in freedom

Wangel And the unknownIt no longer lures you

Ellida Neither lures nor frightens me I could have seen itgone out
into it if only I myself had willed it I could have chosen it And
that is why I could also renounce it

Wangel I begin to understand little by little You think and conceive
in picturesin visible figures Your longing and aching for the sea
your attraction towards this strange man these were the expression of
an awakening and growing desire for freedom nothing else

Ellida I dont know about that But you have been a good physician for
me You found and you dared to use the right remedythe only one that
could help me

Wangel Yes in utmost need and danger we doctors dare much And now you
are coming back to me again Ellida

Ellida Yes dear faithful Wangelnow I am coming back to you again
Now I can For now I come to you freely and on my own responsibility

Wangel looks lovingly at her Ellida Ellida To think that now we can
live wholly for one another

Ellida And with common memories Yours as well as mine

Wangel Yes indeed dear

Ellida And for our children Wangel

Wangel You call them ours

Ellida They who are not mine yet but whom I shall win

Wangel Ours Gladly and quickly kisses her hands I cannot speak my
thanks for those words

HILDE BALLESTED LYNGSTRAND ARNHOLM and BOLETTE come into the
garden At the same time a number of young townspeople and visitors pass
along the footpath

Hilde aside to LYNGSTRAND See Why she and father look exactly as if
they were a betrothed couple

Ballested who has overheard It is summertime little Missie

Arnholm looking at WANGEL and ELLIDA The English steamer is putting
off

Bolette going to the fence You can see her best from here

Lyngstrand The last voyage this year

Ballested Soon all the seahighways will be closed as the poet says
It is sad Mrs Wangel And now were to lose you also for a time
Tomorrow youre off to Skjoldviken I hear

Wangel No nothing will come of that We two have changed our
mindtonight

Arnholm looking from one to the other Ohreally

Bolette coming forward Father is that true

Hilde going towards ELLIDA Are you going to stay with us after all

Ellida Yes dear Hilde if youll have me

Hilde struggling between tears and laughter Fancy Have you

Arnholm to ELLIDA But this is quite a surprise

Ellida smiling earnestly Well you see Mr ArnholmDo you remember
we talked about it yesterday When you have once become a landcreature
you can no longer find your way back again to the sea nor to the
sealife either

Ballested Why thats exactly the case with my mermaid

Ellida Something likeyes

Ballested Only with this differencethat the mermaid dies of it it
while human beings can acclamacclimatise themselves Yes yes I assure
you Mrs Wangel they can acclimatise themselves

Ellida In freedom they can Mr Ballested

Wangel And when they act on their own responsibility dear Ellida

Ellida quickly holding out her hand to him Exactly The great
steamer glides noiselessly out beyond the fjord The music is heard
nearer land
