An incomplete glossary of Australian British or antique terms and
concepts which may prove helpful to understanding this book


A house where they took in cards on a tray from Joe Wilsons
Courtship An upper class house with servants who would take a
visitors card on a tray to announce their presence or if the family
was out to keep a record of the visit

Anniversary Day Mentioned in the text is now known as Australia Day
It commemorates the establishment of the first English settlement in
Australia at Port Jackson Sydney Harbour on 26 January 1788

Gin An obvious abbreviation of aborigine it only refers to female
aborigines and is now considered derogatory It was not considered
derogatory at the time Lawson wrote

Jackaroo At the time Lawson wrote a Jackaroo was a new chum or
newcomer to Australia who sought work on a station to gain experience
The term now applies to any young man working as a station hand A
female station hand is a Jillaroo Variant Jackeroo

Oldfashioned child A child that acts old for their age Americans
would say Precocious

Possum In Australia a class of marsupials that were originally
mistaken for possums They are not especially related to the possums of
North and South America other than both being marsupials

PublicPub The traditional pub in Australia was a hotel with a
public barhence the name The modern pub has often not always
dispensed with the lodging and concentrated on the bar

Tea In addition to the regular meaning Tea can also mean a light snack
or a meal ie where Tea is served In particular Morning Tea about
10 AM and Afternoon Tea about 3 PM are nothing more than a snack but
Evening Tea about 6 PM is a meal When just Tea is used it usually
means the evening meal Variant Teatime

Tucker Food

Shout In addition to the regular meaning it also refers to buying
drinks for all the members of a group etc The use of this term can be
confusing so the first instance is footnoted in the text

Slygrogshop An unlicensed bar or liquorstore

Station A farm or ranch especially one devoted to cattle or sheep

Store Bullock Lawson makes several references to these A bullock is
a castrated bull Bullocks were used in Australia for work that was
too heavy for horses Store may refer to those cattle and their
descendants brought to Australia by the British government and sold to
settlers from the Storehence the standard draft animal

Also a hint with the seasonsremember that the seasons are reversed
from those in the northern hemisphere hence June may be hot but
December is even hotter Australia is at a lower latitude than the
United States so the winters are not harsh by US standards and are not
even mild in the north In fact large parts of Australia are governed
more by dry versus wet than by SpringSummerFallWinter

The Authors Farewell to the Bushmen



 Some carry their swags in the Great NorthWest
 Where the bravest battle and die
 And a few have gone to their last long rest
 And a few have said Goodbye
 The coast grows dim and it may be long
 Ere the Gums again I see
 So I put my soul in a farewell song
 To the chaps who barracked for me

 Their days are hard at the best of times
 And their dreams are dreams of care
 God bless them all for their big soft hearts
 And the brave brave grins they wear
 God keep me straight as a man can go
 And true as a man may be
 For the sake of the hearts that were always so
 Of the men who had faith in me

 And a shipside word I would say you chaps
 Of the blood of the Dontgivein
 The world will call it a boast perhaps
 But Ill win if a man can win
 And not for gold nor the worlds applause
 Though ways to the end they be
 Ill win if a man might win because
 Of the men who believed in me

Joe Wilsons Courtship



There are many times in this world when a healthy boy is happy When he
is put into knickerbockers for instance and comes a man today as
my little Jim used to say When theyre cooking something at home that
he likes When the sandyblight or measles breaks out amongst the
children or the teacher or his wife falls dangerously illor dies it
doesnt matter whichand there aint no school When a boy is naked
and in his natural state for a warm climate like Australia with three
or four of his schoolmates under the shade of the creekoaks in the
bend where theres a good clear pool with a sandy bottom When his
father buys him a gun and he starts out after kangaroos or possums
When he gets a horse saddle and bridle of his own When he has his
arm in splints or a stitch in his headhes proud then the proudest
boy in the district

I wasnt a healthyminded average boy I reckon I was born for a poet
by mistake and grew up to be a Bushman and didnt know what was the
matter with meor the worldbut thats got nothing to do with it

There are times when a man is happy When he finds out that the girl
loves him When hes just married When hes a lawful father for the
first time and everything is going on all right some men make fools
of themselves thenI know I did Im happy tonight because Im out of
debt and can see clear ahead and because I havent been easy for a long
time

But I think that the happiest time in a mans life is when hes courting
a girl and finds out for sure that she loves him and hasnt a thought
for any one else Make the most of your courting days you young chaps
and keep them clean for theyre about the only days when theres a
chance of poetry and beauty coming into this life Make the best of them
and youll never regret it the longest day you live Theyre the days
that the wife will look back to anyway in the brightest of times as
well as in the blackest and there shouldnt be anything in those days
that might hurt her when she looks back Make the most of your courting
days you young chaps for they will never come again

A married man knows all about itafter a while he sees the woman world
through the eyes of his wife he knows what an extra moments pressure
of the hand means and if he has had a hard life and is inclined to be
cynical the knowledge does him no good It leads him into awful messes
sometimes for a married man if hes inclined that way has three times
the chance with a woman that a single man hasbecause the married man
knows He is privileged he can guess pretty closely what a woman means
when she says something else he knows just how far he can go he can go
farther in five minutes towards coming to the point with a woman than an
innocent young man dares go in three weeks Above all the married man
is more decided with women he takes them and things for granted In
short he iswell he is a married man And when he knows all this how
much better or happier is he for it Mark Twain says that he lost all
the beauty of the river when he saw it with a pilots eyeand there
you have it

But its all new to a young chap provided he hasnt been a young
blackguard Its all wonderful new and strange to him Hes a
different man He finds that he never knew anything about women He sees
none of womans little ways and tricks in his girl He is in heaven one
day and down near the other place the next and thats the sort of thing
that makes life interesting He takes his new world for granted And
when she says shell be his wife

Make the most of your courting days you young chaps for theyve got a
lot of influence on your married life afterwardsa lot more than youd
think Make the best of them for theyll never come any more unless
we do our courting over again in another world If we do Ill make the
most of mine

But looking back I didnt do so badly after all I never told you
about the days I courted Mary The more I look back the more I come to
think that I made the most of them and if I had no more to regret in
married life than I have in my courting days I wouldnt walk to and fro
in the room or up and down the yard in the dark sometimes or lie awake
some nights thinking Ah well

I was between twentyone and thirty then birthdays had never been any
use to me and Id left off counting them You dont take much stock in
birthdays in the Bush Id knocked about the country for a few years
shearing and fencing and droving a little and wasting my life without
getting anything for it I drank now and then and made a fool of
myself I was reckoned wild but I only drank because I felt less
sensitive and the world seemed a lot saner and better and kinder when
I had a few drinks I loved my fellowman then and felt nearer to him
Its better to be thought wild than to be considered eccentric
or ratty Now my old mate Jack Barnes drankas far as I could
seefirst because hed inherited the gambling habit from his father
along with his fathers luck hed the habit of being cheated and losing
very bad and when he lost he drank Till drink got a hold on him Jack
was sentimental too but in a different way I was sentimental about
other peoplemore fool Iwhereas Jack was sentimental about himself
Before he was married and when he was recovering from a spree hed
write rhymes about Only a boy drunk by the roadside and that sort of
thing and hed call em poetry and talk about signing them and sending
them to the Town and Country Journal But he generally tore them up
when he got better The Bush is breeding a race of poets and I dont
know what the country will come to in the end

Well It was after Jack and I had been out shearing at Beenaway shed in
the Big Scrubs Jack was living in the little farming town of Solong
and I was hanging round Black the squatter wanted some fencing done
and a new stable built or buggy and harnesshouse at his place
at Haviland a few miles out of Solong Jack and I were good Bush
carpenters so we took the job to keep us going till something else
turned up Better than doing nothing said Jack

Theres a nice little girl in service at Blacks he said Shes more
like an adopted daughter in fact than a servant Shes a real good
little girl and goodlooking into the bargain I hear that young Black
is sweet on her but they say she wont have anything to do with him I
know a lot of chaps that have tried for her but theyve never had any
luck Shes a regular little dumpling and I like dumplings They call
her Possum You ought to try a bear up in that direction Joe

I was always shy with womenexcept perhaps some that I should have
fought shy of but Jack wasnthe was afraid of no woman good bad or
indifferent I havent time to explain why but somehow whenever a girl
took any notice of me I took it for granted that she was only playing
with me and felt nasty about it I made one or two mistakes butah
well

My wife knows little Possum said Jack Ill get her to ask her out
to our place and let you know

I reckoned that he wouldnt get me there then and made a note to be on
the watch for tricks I had a hopeless little lovestory behind me of
course I suppose most married men can look back to their lost love few
marry the first flame Many a married man looks back and thinks it was
damned lucky that he didnt get the girl he couldnt have Jack had been
my successful rival only he didnt know itI dont think his wife knew
it either I used to think her the prettiest and sweetest little girl in
the district

But Jack was mighty keen on fixing me up with the little girl at
Haviland He seemed to take it for granted that I was going to fall in
love with her at first sight He took too many things for granted as far
as I was concerned and got me into awful tangles sometimes

You let me alone and Ill fix you up Joe he said as we rode up
to the station Ill make it all right with the girl Youre rather
a goodlooking chap Youve got the sort of eyes that take with girls
only you dont know it you havent got the go If I had your eyes along
with my other attractions Id be in trouble on account of a woman about
once aweek

For Gods sake shut up Jack I said

Do you remember the first glimpse you got of your wife Perhaps not in
England where so many couples grow up together from childhood but its
different in Australia where you may hail from two thousand miles away
from where your wife was born and yet she may be a countrywoman of
yours and a countrywoman in ideas and politics too I remember the
first glimpse I got of Mary

It was a twostorey brick house with wide balconies and verandahs all
round and a double row of pines down to the front gate Parallel at the
back was an old slabandshingle place one room deep and about eight
rooms long with a row of skillions at the back the place was used for
kitchen laundry servants rooms c This was the old homestead before
the new house was built There was a wide oldfashioned brickfloored
verandah in front with an open end there was ivy climbing up the
verandah post on one side and a babyrose on the other and a grapevine
near the chimney We rode up to the end of the verandah and Jack called
to see if there was any one at home and Mary came trotting out so it
was in the frame of vines that I first saw her

More than once since then Ive had a fancy to wonder whether the
rosebush killed the grapevine or the ivy smothered em both in the
end I used to have a vague idea of riding that way some day to see You
do get strange fancies at odd times

Jack asked her if the boss was in He did all the talking I saw a
little girl rather plump with a complexion like a New England or Blue
Mountain girl or a girl from Tasmania or from Gippsland in Victoria
Red and white girls were very scarce in the Solong district She had the
biggest and brightest eyes Id seen round there dark hazel eyes as I
found out afterwards and bright as a possums No wonder they called
her Possum I forgot at once that Mrs Jack Barnes was the prettiest
girl in the district I felt a sort of comfortable satisfaction in the
fact that I was on horseback most Bushmen look better on horseback It
was a black filly a fresh young thing and she seemed as shy of girls
as I was myself I noticed Mary glanced in my direction once or twice
to see if she knew me but when she looked the filly took all my
attention Mary trotted in to tell old Black he was wanted and after
Jack had seen him and arranged to start work next day we started back
to Solong

I expected Jack to ask me what I thought of Marybut he didnt He
squinted at me sideways once or twice and didnt say anything for a long
time and then he started talking of other things I began to feel wild
at him He seemed so damnably satisfied with the way things were going
He seemed to reckon that I was a gone case now but as he didnt say
so I had no way of getting at him I felt sure hed go home and
tell his wife that Joe Wilson was properly gone on little Possum at
Haviland That was all Jacks way

Next morning we started to work We were to build the buggyhouse at
the back near the end of the old house but first we had to take down
a rotten old place that might have been the original hut in the Bush
before the old house was built There was a window in it opposite the
laundry window in the old place and the first thing I did was to take
out the sash Id noticed Jack yarning with Possum before he started
work While I was at work at the window he called me round to the other
end of the hut to help him lift a grindstone out of the way and when
wed done it he took the tips of my ear between his fingers and thumb
and stretched it and whispered into it

Dont hurry with that window Joe the strips are hardwood and hard to
get offyoull have to take the sash out very carefully so as not to
break the glass Then he stretched my ear a little more and put his
mouth closer

Make a lookingglass of that window Joe he said

I was used to Jack and when I went back to the window I started to
puzzle out what he meant and presently I saw it by chance

That window reflected the laundry window the room was dark inside and
there was a good clear reflection and presently I saw Mary come to the
laundry window and stand with her hands behind her back thoughtfully
watching me The laundry window had an oldfashioned hinged sash and I
like that sort of windowtheres more romance about it I think There
was thick darkgreen ivy all round the window and Mary looked prettier
than a picture I squared up my shoulders and put my heels together and
put as much style as I could into the work I couldnt have turned round
to save my life

Presently Jack came round and Mary disappeared

Well he whispered

Youre a fool Jack I said Shes only interested in the old house
being pulled down

Thats all right he said Ive been keeping an eye on the business
round the corner and she aint interested when IM round this end

You seem mighty interested in the business I said

Yes said Jack This sort of thing just suits a man of my rank in
times of peace

What made you think of the window I asked

Oh thats as simple as striking matches Im up to all those dodges
Why where there wasnt a window Ive fixed up a piece of lookingglass
to see if a girl was taking any notice of me when she thought I wasnt
looking

He went away and presently Mary was at the window again and this
time she had a tray with cups of tea and a plate of cake and
breadandbutter I was prizing off the strips that held the sash
very carefully and my heart suddenly commenced to gallop without any
reference to me Id never felt like that before except once or
twice It was just as if Id swallowed some clockwork arrangement
unconsciously and it had started to go without warning I reckon it
was all on account of that blarsted Jack working me up He had a
quiet way of working you up to a thing that made you want to hit him
sometimesafter youd made an ass of yourself

I didnt hear Mary at first I hoped Jack would come round and help me
out of the fix but he didnt

MrMr Wilson said Mary She had a sweet voice

I turned round

I thought you and Mr Barnes might like a cup of tea

Oh thank you I said and I made a dive for the window as if hurry
would help it I trod on an old caskhoop it sprang up and dinted my
shin and I stumbledand that didnt help matters much

Oh did you hurt yourself Mr Wilson cried Mary

Hurt myself Oh no not at all thank you I blurted out It takes
more than that to hurt me

I was about the reddest shy lanky fool of a Bushman that was ever taken
at a disadvantage on foot and when I took the tray my hands shook so
that a lot of the tea was spilt into the saucers I embarrassed her too
like the damned fool I was till she must have been as red as I was and
its a wonder we didnt spill the whole lot between us I got away
from the window in as much of a hurry as if Jack had cut his leg with a
chisel and fainted and I was running with whisky for him I blundered
round to where he was feeling like a man feels when hes just made an
ass of himself in public The memory of that sort of thing hurts you
worse and makes you jerk your head more impatiently than the thought of
a past crime would I think

I pulled myself together when I got to where Jack was

Here Jack I said Ive struck something all right heres some tea
and browniewell hang out here all right

Jack took a cup of tea and a piece of cake and sat down to enjoy it
just as if hed paid for it and ordered it to be sent out about that
time

He was silent for a while with the sort of silence that always made me
wild at him Presently he said as if hed just thought of it

Thats a very pretty little girl Possum isnt she Joe Do you
notice how she dressesalways fresh and trim But shes got on her
best bibandtucker today and a pinafore with frills to it And its
ironingday too It cant be on your account If it was Saturday or
Sunday afternoon or some holiday I could understand it But perhaps
one of her admirers is going to take her to the church bazaar in Solong
tonight Thats what it is

He gave me time to think over that

But yet she seems interested in you Joe he said Why didnt you
offer to take her to the bazaar instead of letting another chap get in
ahead of you You miss all your chances Joe

Then a thought struck me I ought to have known Jack well enough to have
thought of it before

Look here Jack I said What have you been saying to that girl about
me

Oh not much said Jack There isnt much to say about you

What did you tell her

Oh nothing in particular Shed heard all about you before

She hadnt heard much good I suppose I said

Well thats true as far as I could make out But youve only got
yourself to blame I didnt have the breeding and rearing of you I
smoothed over matters with her as much as I could

What did you tell her I said Thats what I want to know

Well to tell the truth I didnt tell her anything much I only
answered questions

And what questions did she ask

Well in the first place she asked if your name wasnt Joe Wilson and
I said it was as far as I knew Then she said she heard that you wrote
poetry and I had to admit that that was true

Look here Jack I said Ive two minds to punch your head

And she asked me if it was true that you were wild said Jack and I
said you was a bit She said it seemed a pity She asked me if it was
true that you drank and I drew a long face and said that I was sorry
to say it was true She asked me if you had any friends and I said none
that I knew of except me I said that youd lost all your friends they
stuck to you as long as they could but they had to give you best one
after the other

What next

She asked me if you were delicate and I said no you were as tough as
fencingwire She said you looked rather pale and thin and asked me if
youd had an illness lately And I said noit was all on account of
the wild dissipated life youd led She said it was a pity you hadnt
a mother or a sister to look after youit was a pity that something
couldnt be done for you and I said it was but I was afraid that
nothing could be done I told her that I was doing all I could to keep
you straight

I knew enough of Jack to know that most of this was true And so she
only pitied me after all I felt as if Id been courting her for six
months and shed thrown me overbut I didnt know anything about women
yet

Did you tell her I was in jail I growled

No by Gum I forgot that But never mind Ill fix that up all right
Ill tell her that you got two years hard for horsestealing That
ought to make her interested in you if she isnt already

We smoked a while

And was that all she said I asked

WhoOh Possum said Jack rousing himself Wellno let me
think We got chatting of other thingsyou know a married mans
privileged and can say a lot more to a girl than a single man can I
got talking nonsense about sweethearts and one thing led to another
till at last she said I suppose Mr Wilsons got a sweetheart Mr
Barnes

And what did you say I growled

Oh I told her that you were a holy terror amongst the girls said
Jack Youd better take back that tray Joe and let us get to work

I wouldnt take back the traybut that didnt mend matters for Jack
took it back himself

I didnt see Marys reflection in the window again so I took the window
out I reckoned that she was just a bighearted impulsive little thing
as many Australian girls are and I reckoned that I was a fool for
thinking for a moment that she might give me a second thought except
by way of kindness Why young Black and half a dozen better men than me
were sweet on her and young Black was to get his fathers station and
the moneyor rather his mothers money for she held the stuff she
kept it close too by all accounts Young Black was away at the time
and his mother was dead against him about Mary but that didnt make
any difference as far as I could see I reckoned that it was only
just going to be a hopeless heartbreaking standfaroffandworship
affair as far as I was concernedlike my first love affair that I
havent told you about yet I was tired of being pitied by good girls
You see I didnt know women then If I had known I think I might have
made more than one mess of my life

Jack rode home to Solong every night I was staying at a pub some
distance out of town between Solong and Haviland There were three or
four wet days and we didnt get on with the work I fought shy of Mary
till one day she was hanging out clothes and the line broke It was the
oldstyle sixpenny clothesline The clothes were all down but it was
clean grass so it didnt matter much I looked at Jack

Go and help her you capital Idiot he said and I made the plunge

Oh thank you Mr Wilson said Mary when I came to help She had the
broken end of the line and was trying to hold some of the clothes off
the ground as if she could pull it an inch with the heavy wet sheets
and tablecloths and things on it or as if it would do any good if she
did But thats the way with womenespecially little womensome of em
would try to pull a store bullock if they got the end of the rope on
the right side of the fence I took the line from Mary and accidentally
touched her soft plump little hand as I did so it sent a thrill right
through me She seemed a lot cooler than I was

Now in cases like this especially if you lose your head a bit you get
hold of the loose end of the rope thats hanging from the post with one
hand and the end of the line with the clothes on with the other and
try to pull em far enough together to make a knot And thats about
all you do for the present except look like a fool Then I took off
the post end spliced the line took it over the fork and pulled while
Mary helped me with the prop I thought Jack might have come and taken
the prop from her but he didnt he just went on with his work as if
nothing was happening inside the horizon

Shed got the line about twothirds full of clothes it was a bit short
now so she had to jump and catch it with one hand and hold it down
while she pegged a sheet shed thrown over Id made the plunge now
so I volunteered to help her I held down the line while she threw
the things over and pegged out As we got near the post and higher I
straightened out some ends and pegged myself Bushmen are handy at most
things We laughed and now and again Mary would say No thats not
the way Mr Wilson thats not right the sheet isnt far enough over
wait till I fix it c Id a reckless idea once of holding her up
while she pegged and I was glad afterwards that I hadnt made such a
fool of myself

Theres only a few more things in the basket Miss Brand I said You
cant reachIll fix em up

She seemed to give a little gasp

Oh those things are not ready yet she said theyre not rinsed
and she grabbed the basket and held it away from me The things looked
the same to me as the rest on the line they looked rinsed enough and
blued too I reckoned that she didnt want me to take the trouble or
thought that I mightnt like to be seen hanging out clothes and was
only doing it out of kindness

Oh its no trouble I said let me hang em out I like it Ive
hung out clothes at home on a windy day and I made a reach into the
basket But she flushed red with temper I thought and snatched the
basket away

Excuse me Mr Wilson she said but those things are not ready yet
and she marched into the washhouse

Ah well youve got a little temper of your own I thought to myself

When I told Jack he said that Id made another fool of myself He said
Id both disappointed and offended her He said that my line was to
stand off a bit and be serious and melancholy in the background

That evening when wed started home we stopped some time yarning with
a chap we met at the gate and I happened to look back and saw Mary
hanging out the rest of the thingsshe thought that we were out of
sight Then I understood why those things werent ready while we were
round

For the next day or two Mary didnt take the slightest notice of me
and I kept out of her way Jack said Id disillusioned herand hurt her
dignitywhich was a thousand times worse He said Id spoilt the thing
altogether He said that shed got an idea that I was shy and poetic
and Id only shown myself the usual sort of Bushwhacker

I noticed her talking and chatting with other fellows once or twice and
it made me miserable I got drunk two evenings running and then as it
appeared afterwards Mary consulted Jack and at last she said to him
when we were together

Do you play draughts Mr Barnes

No said Jack

Do you Mr Wilson she asked suddenly turning her big bright eyes on
me and speaking to me for the first time since last washingday

Yes I said I do a little Then there was a silence and I had to
say something else

Do you play draughts Miss Brand I asked

Yes she said but I cant get any one to play with me here of an
evening the men are generally playing cards or reading Then she said
Its very dull these long winter evenings when youve got nothing to
do Young Mr Black used to play draughts but hes away

I saw Jack winking at me urgently

Ill play a game with you if you like I said but I aint much of a
player

Oh thank you Mr Wilson When shall you have an evening to spare

We fixed it for that same evening We got chummy over the draughts I
had a suspicion even then that it was a putup job to keep me away from
the pub

Perhaps she found a way of giving a hint to old Black without committing
herself Women have waysor perhaps Jack did it Anyway next day the
Boss came round and said to me

Look here Joe youve got no occasion to stay at the pub Bring along
your blankets and camp in one of the spare rooms of the old house You
can have your tucker here

He was a good sort was Black the squatter a squatter of the old
school whod shared the early hardships with his men and couldnt see
why he should not shake hands and have a smoke and a yarn over old times
with any of his old station hands that happened to come along But hed
married an Englishwoman after the hardships were over and shed never
got any Australian notions

Next day I found one of the skillion rooms scrubbed out and a bed fixed
up for me Im not sure to this day who did it but I supposed that
goodnatured old Black had given one of the women a hint After tea
I had a yarn with Mary sitting on a log of the woodheap I dont
remember exactly how we both came to be there or who sat down
first There was about two feet between us We got very chummy and
confidential She told me about her childhood and her father

Hed been an old mate of Blacks a younger son of a welltodo English
family with blue blood in it I believe and sent out to Australia
with a thousand pounds to make his way as many younger sons are with
more or less They think theyre hard done by they blue their thousand
pounds in Melbourne or Sydney and they dont make any more nowadays
for the Roarin Days have been dead these thirty years I wish Id had a
thousand pounds to start on

Marys mother was the daughter of a German immigrant who selected
up there in the old days She had a will of her own as far as I could
understand and bossed the home till the day of her death Marys
father made money and lost it and drankand died Mary remembered
him sitting on the verandah one evening with his hand on her head and
singing a German song the Lorelei I think it was softly as if to
himself Next day he stayed in bed and the children were kept out of
the room and when he died the children were adopted round there was
a little money coming from England

Mary told me all about her girlhood She went first to live with a sort
of cousin in town in a house where they took in cards on a tray and
then she came to live with Mrs Black who took a fancy to her at first
Id had no boyhood to speak of so I gave her some of my ideas of what
the world ought to be and she seemed interested

Next day there were sheets on my bed and I felt pretty cocky until
I remembered that Id told her I had no one to care for me then I
suspected pity again

But next evening we remembered that both our fathers and mothers were
dead and discovered that we had no friends except Jack and old Black
and things went on very satisfactorily

And next day there was a little table in my room with a crocheted cover
and a lookingglass

I noticed the other girls began to act mysterious and giggle when I was
round but Mary didnt seem aware of it

We got very chummy Mary wasnt comfortable at Haviland Old Black
was very fond of her and always took her part but she wanted to be
independent She had a great idea of going to Sydney and getting into
the hospital as a nurse She had friends in Sydney but she had no
money There was a little money coming to her when she was twentyonea
few poundsand she was going to try and get it before that time

Look here Miss Brand I said after wed watched the moon rise Ill
lend you the money Ive got plentymore than I know what to do with

But I saw Id hurt her She sat up very straight for a while looking
before her then she said it was time to go in and said Goodnight Mr
Wilson

I reckoned Id done it that time but Mary told me afterwards that she
was only hurt because it struck her that what she said about money might
have been taken for a hint She didnt understand me yet and I didnt
know human nature I didnt say anything to Jackin fact about this
time I left off telling him about things He didnt seem hurt he worked
hard and seemed happy

I really meant what I said to Mary about the money It was pure good
nature Id be a happier man now I think and richer man perhaps if
Id never grown any more selfish than I was that night on the woodheap
with Mary I felt a great sympathy for herbut I got to love her I
went through all the ups and downs of it One day I was having tea in
the kitchen and Mary and another girl named Sarah reached me a clean
plate at the same time I took Sarahs plate because she was first and
Mary seemed very nasty about it and that gave me great hopes But all
next evening she played draughts with a drover that shed chummed up
with I pretended to be interested in Sarahs talk but it didnt seem
to work

A few days later a Sydney Jackaroo visited the station He had a good
pearifle and one afternoon he started to teach Mary to shoot at a
target They seemed to get very chummy I had a nice time for three or
four days I can tell you I was worse than a walleyed bullock with
the pleuro The other chaps had a shot out of the rifle Mary called Mr
Wilson to have a shot and I made a worse fool of myself by sulking If
it hadnt been a blooming Jackaroo I wouldnt have minded so much

Next evening the Jackaroo and one or two other chaps and the girls went
out possumshooting Mary went I could have gone but I didnt I
mooched round all the evening like an orphan bandicoot on a burnt ridge
and then I went up to the pub and filled myself with beer and damned
the world and came home and went to bed I think that evening was
the only time I ever wrote poetry down on a piece of paper I got so
miserable that I enjoyed it

I felt better next morning and reckoned I was cured I ran against Mary
accidentally and had to say something

How did you enjoy yourself yesterday evening Miss Brand I asked

Oh very well thank you Mr Wilson she said Then she asked How
did you enjoy yourself Mr Wilson

I puzzled over that afterwards but couldnt make anything out of it
Perhaps she only said it for the sake of saying something But about
this time my handkerchiefs and collars disappeared from the room and
turned up washed and ironed and laid tidily on my table I used to keep
an eye out but could never catch anybody near my room I straightened
up and kept my room a bit tidy and when my handkerchief got too dirty
and I was ashamed of letting it go to the wash Id slip down to the
river after dark and wash it out and dry it next day and rub it up to
look as if it hadnt been washed and leave it on my table I felt
so full of hope and joy that I worked twice as hard as Jack till one
morning he remarked casually

I see youve made a new mash Joe I saw the halfcaste cook tidying
up your room this morning and taking your collars and things to the
washhouse

I felt very much off colour all the rest of the day and I had such
a bad night of it that I made up my mind next morning to look the
hopelessness square in the face and live the thing down


It was the evening before Anniversary Day Jack and I had put in a good
days work to get the job finished and Jack was having a smoke and a
yarn with the chaps before he started home We sat on an old log along
by the fence at the back of the house There was Jimmy Nowlett the
bullockdriver and long Dave Regan the drover and big Jim Bullock the
fencer and one or two others Mary and the station girls and one or
two visitors were sitting under the old verandah The Jackaroo was
there too so I felt happy It was the girls who used to bring the chaps
hanging round They were getting up a dance party for Anniversary night
Along in the evening another chap came riding up to the station he was
a big shearer a dark handsome fellow who looked like a gipsy it was
reckoned that there was foreign blood in him He went by the name of
Romany He was supposed to be shook after Mary too He had the nastiest
temper and the best violin in the district and the chaps put up with
him a lot because they wanted him to play at Bush dances The moon had
risen over Pine Ridge but it was dusky where we were We saw Romany
loom up riding in from the gate he rode round the end of the
coachhouse and across towards where we wereI suppose he was going to
tie up his horse at the fence but about halfway across the grass he
disappeared It struck me that there was something peculiar about the
way he got down and I heard a sound like a horse stumbling

What the hells Romany trying to do said Jimmy Nowlett He couldnt
have fell off his horseor else hes drunk

A couple of chaps got up and went to see Then there was that waiting
mysterious silence that comes when something happens in the dark and
nobody knows what it is I went over and the thing dawned on me Id
stretched a wire clothesline across there during the day and had
forgotten all about it for the moment Romany had no idea of the line
and as he rode up it caught him on a level with his elbows and scraped
him off his horse He was sitting on the grass swearing in a surprised
voice and the horse looked surprised too Romany wasnt hurt but the
sudden shock had spoilt his temper He wanted to know whod put up that
bloody line He came over and sat on the log The chaps smoked a while

What did you git down so sudden for Romany asked Jim Bullock
presently Did you hurt yerself on the pommel

Why didnt you ask the horse to go round asked Dave Regan

Id only like to know who put up that bleeding wire growled Romany

Well said Jimmy Nowlett if wed put up a sign to beware of the line
you couldnt have seen it in the dark

Unless it was a transparency with a candle behind it said Dave Regan
But why didnt you get down on one end Romany instead of all along
It wouldnt have jolted yer so much

All this with the Bush drawl and between the puffs of their pipes
But I didnt take any interest in it I was brooding over Mary and the
Jackaroo

Ive heard of men getting down over their horses head said
Dave presently in a reflective sort of wayin fact Ive done it
myselfbut I never saw a man get off backwards over his horses rump

But they saw that Romany was getting nasty and they wanted him to play
the fiddle next night so they dropped it

Mary was singing an old song I always thought she had a sweet voice
and Id have enjoyed it if that damned Jackaroo hadnt been listening
too We listened in silence until shed finished

That gals got a nice voice said Jimmy Nowlett

Nice voice snarled Romany whod been waiting for a chance to be
nasty Why Ive heard a tomcat sing better

I moved and Jack he was sitting next me nudged me to keep quiet The
chaps didnt like Romanys talk about Possum at all They were all fond
of her she wasnt a pet or a tomboy for she wasnt built that way
but they were fond of her in such a way that they didnt like to hear
anything said about her They said nothing for a while but it meant a
lot Perhaps the single men didnt care to speak for fear that it would
be said that they were gone on Mary But presently Jimmy Nowlett gave a
big puff at his pipe and spoke

I suppose you got bit too in that quarter Romany

Oh she tried it on but it didnt go said Romany Ive met her sort
before Shes setting her cap at that Jackaroo now Some girls will run
after anything with trousers on and he stood up

Jack Barnes must have felt what was coming for he grabbed my arm and
whispered Sit still Joe damn you Hes too good for you but I was
on my feet and facing Romany as if a giant hand had reached down and
wrenched me off the log and set me there

Youre a damned crawler Romany I said

Little Jimmy Nowlett was between us and the other fellows round us
before a blow got home Hold on you damned fools they said Keep
quiet till we get away from the house There was a little clear flat
down by the river and plenty of light there so we decided to go down
there and have it out

Now I never was a fighting man Id never learnt to use my hands I
scarcely knew how to put them up Jack often wanted to teach me but I
wouldnt bother about it Hed say Youll get into a fight some day
Joe or out of one and shame me but I hadnt the patience to learn
Hed wanted me to take lessons at the station after work but he used to
get excited and I didnt want Mary to see him knocking me about Before
he was married Jack was always getting into fightshe generally tackled
a better man and got a hiding but he didnt seem to care so long as
he made a good showthough he used to explain the thing away from a
scientific point of view for weeks after To tell the truth I had a
horror of fighting I had a horror of being marked about the face I
think Id sooner stand off and fight a man with revolvers than fight him
with fists and then I think I would say last thing Dont shoot me
in the face Then again I hated the idea of hitting a man It seemed
brutal to me I was too sensitive and sentimental and that was what
the matter was Jack seemed very serious on it as we walked down to the
river and he couldnt help hanging out blue lights

Why didnt you let me teach you to use your hands he said The
only chance now is that Romany cant fight after all If youd waited
a minute Id have been at him We were a bit behind the rest and Jack
started giving me points about lefts and rights and halfarms and
that sort of thing Hes lefthanded and thats the worst of it said
Jack You must only make as good a show as you can and one of us will
take him on afterwards

But I just heard him and that was all It was to be my first fight since
I was a boy but somehow I felt cool about itsort of dulled If the
chaps had known all they would have set me down as a cur I thought of
that but it didnt make any difference with me then I knew it was a
thing they couldnt understand I knew I was reckoned pretty soft But
I knew one thing that they didnt know I knew that it was going to be
a fight to a finish one way or the other I had more brains and
imagination than the rest put together and I suppose that that was the
real cause of most of my trouble I kept saying to myself Youll have
to go through with it now Joe old man Its the turningpoint of your
life If I won the fight Id set to work and win Mary if I lost Id
leave the district for ever A man thinks a lot in a flash sometimes I
used to get excited over little things because of the very paltriness
of them but I was mostly cool in a crisisJack was the reverse I
looked ahead I wouldnt be able to marry a girl who could look back and
remember when her husband was beaten by another manno matter what sort
of brute the other man was

I never in my life felt so cool about a thing Jack kept whispering
instructions and showing with his hands up to the last moment but it
was all lost on me

Looking back I think there was a bit of romance about it Mary singing
under the vines to amuse a Jackaroo dude and a coward going down to the
river in the moonlight to fight for her

It was very quiet in the little moonlit flat by the river We took off
our coats and were ready There was no swearing or barracking It seemed
an understood thing with the men that if I went out first round Jack
would fight Romany and if Jack knocked him out somebody else would
fight Jack to square matters Jim Bullock wouldnt mind obliging for
one he was a mate of Jacks but he didnt mind who he fought so long
as it was for the sake of fair playor peace and quietness as he
said Jim was very goodnatured He backed Romany and of course Jack
backed me

As far as I could see all Romany knew about fighting was to jerk one
arm up in front of his face and duck his head by way of a feint and
then rush and lunge out But he had the weight and strength and length
of reach and my first lesson was a very short one I went down early
in the round But it did me good the blow and the look Id seen
in Romanys eyes knocked all the sentiment out of me Jack said
nothinghe seemed to regard it as a hopeless job from the first
Next round I tried to remember some things Jack had told me and made a
better show but I went down in the end

I felt Jack breathing quick and trembling as he lifted me up

How are you Joe he whispered

Im all right I said

Its all right whispered Jack in a voice as if I was going to be
hanged but it would soon be all over He cant use his hands much more
than you cantake your time Joetry to remember something I told you
for Gods sake

When two men fight who dont know how to use their hands they stand a
show of knocking each other about a lot I got some awful thumps
but mostly on the body Jimmy Nowlett began to get excited and jump
roundhe was an excitable little fellow

Fight you he yelled Why dont you fight That aint fightin
Fight and dont try to murder each other Use your crimson hands or by
God Ill chip you Fight or Ill blanky well bullockwhip the pair of
you then his language got awful They said we went like windmills and
that nearly every one of the blows we made was enough to kill a bullock
if it had got home Jimmy stopped us once but they held him back

Presently I went down pretty flat but the blow was well up on the head
and didnt matter muchI had a good thick skull And I had one good eye
yet

For Gods sake hit him whispered Jackhe was trembling like a leaf
Dont mind what I told you I wish I was fighting him myself Get a
blow home for Gods sake Make a good show this round and Ill stop the
fight

That showed how little even Jack my old mate understood me

I had the Bushman up in me now and wasnt going to be beaten while
I could think I was wonderfully cool and learning to fight Theres
nothing like a fight to teach a man I was thinking fast and learning
more in three seconds than Jacks sparring could have taught me in three
weeks People think that blows hurt in a fight but they dontnot
till afterwards I fancy that a fighting man if he isnt altogether an
animal suffers more mentally than he does physically

While I was getting my wind I could hear through the moonlight and still
air the sound of Marys voice singing up at the house I thought hard
into the future even as I fought The fight only seemed something that
was passing

I was on my feet again and at it and presently I lunged out and felt
such a jar in my arm that I thought it was telescoped I thought Id put
out my wrist and elbow And Romany was lying on the broad of his back

I heard Jack draw three breaths of relief in one He said nothing as
he straightened me up but I could feel his heart beating He said
afterwards that he didnt speak because he thought a word might spoil
it

I went down again but Jack told me afterwards that he FELT I was all
right when he lifted me

Then Romany went down then we fell together and the chaps separated
us I got another knockdown blow in and was beginning to enjoy the
novelty of it when Romany staggered and limped

Ive done he said Ive twisted my ankle Hed caught his heel
against a tuft of grass

Shake hands yelled Jimmy Nowlett

I stepped forward but Romany took his coat and limped to his horse

If yer dont shake hands with Wilson Ill lamb yer howled Jimmy but
Jack told him to let the man alone and Romany got on his horse somehow
and rode off

I saw Jim Bullock stoop and pick up something from the grass and heard
him swear in surprise There was some whispering and presently Jim
said

If I thought that Id kill him

What is it asked Jack

Jim held up a butchers knife It was common for a man to carry a
butchers knife in a sheath fastened to his belt

Why did you let your man fight with a butchers knife in his belt
asked Jimmy Nowlett

But the knife could easily have fallen out when Romany fell and we
decided it that way

Any way said Jimmy Nowlett if hed stuck Joe in hot blood before us
all it wouldnt be so bad as if he sneaked up and stuck him in the back
in the dark But youd best keep an eye over yer shoulder for a year or
two Joe That chaps got Eyetalian blood in him somewhere And now the
best thing you chaps can do is to keep your mouth shut and keep all this
dark from the gals

Jack hurried me on ahead He seemed to act queer and when I glanced
at him I could have sworn that there was water in his eyes I said that
Jack had no sentiment except for himself but I forgot and Im sorry I
said it

Whats up Jack I asked

Nothing said Jack

Whats up you old fool I said

Nothing said Jack except that Im damned proud of you Joe you
old ass and he put his arm round my shoulders and gave me a shake
I didnt know it was in you JoeI wouldnt have said it before
or listened to any other man say it but I didnt think you had the
pluckGods truth I didnt Come along and get your face fixed up

We got into my room quietly and Jack got a dish of water and told one
of the chaps to sneak a piece of fresh beef from somewhere

Jack was as proud as a dog with a tin tail as he fussed round me
He fixed up my face in the best style he knew and he knew a good
manyhed been mended himself so often

While he was at work we heard a sudden hush and a scraping of feet
amongst the chaps that Jack had kicked out of the room and a girls
voice whispered Is he hurt Tell me I want to knowI might be able
to help

It made my heart jump I can tell you Jack went out at once and there
was some whispering When he came back he seemed wild

What is it Jack I asked

Oh nothing he said only that damned slut of a halfcaste cook
overheard some of those blanky fools arguing as to how Romanys knife
got out of the sheath and shes put a nice yarn round amongst the
girls Theres a regular bobbery but its all right now Jimmy
Nowletts telling em lies at a great rate

Presently there was another hush outside and a saucer with vinegar and
brown paper was handed in

One of the chaps brought some beer and whisky from the pub and we had
a quiet little time in my room Jack wanted to stay all night but I
reminded him that his little wife was waiting for him in Solong so he
said hed be round early in the morning and went home

I felt the reaction pretty bad I didnt feel proud of the affair at
all I thought it was a low brutal business all round Romany was a
quiet chap after all and the chaps had no right to chyack him Perhaps
hed had a hard life and carried a big swag of trouble that we didnt
know anything about He seemed a lonely man Id gone through enough
myself to teach me not to judge men I made up my mind to tell him how I
felt about the matter next time we met Perhaps I made my usual mistake
of bothering about feelings in another party that hadnt any feelings
at allperhaps I didnt but its generally best to chance it on the
kind side in a case like this Altogether I felt as if Id made another
fool of myself and been a weak coward I drank the rest of the beer and
went to sleep

About daylight I woke and heard Jacks horse on the gravel He came
round the back of the buggyshed and up to my door and then suddenly
a girl screamed out I pulled on my trousers and lasticside boots and
hurried out It was Mary herself dressed and sitting on an old stone
step at the back of the kitchen with her face in her hands and Jack was
off his horse and stooping by her side with his hand on her shoulder
She kept saying I thought you were I thought you were I
didnt catch the name An old singlebarrel muzzleloader shotgun was
lying in the grass at her feet It was the gun they used to keep loaded
and hanging in straps in a room of the kitchen ready for a shot at a
cunning old hawk that they called Tarnal Death and that used to be
always after the chickens

When Mary lifted her face it was as white as notepaper and her eyes
seemed to grow wilder when she caught sight of me

Oh you did frighten me Mr Barnes she gasped Then she gave a little
ghost of a laugh and stood up and some colour came back

Oh Im a little fool she said quickly I thought I heard old
Tarnal Death at the chickens and I thought it would be a great thing
if I got the gun and brought him down so I got up and dressed quietly
so as not to wake Sarah And then you came round the corner and
frightened me I dont know what you must think of me Mr Barnes

Never mind said Jack You go and have a sleep or you wont be
able to dance tonight Never mind the gunIll put that away And he
steered her round to the door of her room off the brick verandah where
she slept with one of the other girls

Well thats a rum start I said

Yes it is said Jack its very funny Well hows your face this
morning Joe

He seemed a lot more serious than usual

We were hard at work all the morning cleaning out the big woolshed and
getting it ready for the dance hanging hoops for the candles making
seats c I kept out of sight of the girls as much as I could One side
of my face was a sight and the other wasnt too classical I felt as if
I had been stung by a swarm of bees

Youre a fresh sweetscented beauty now and no mistake Joe said
Jimmy Nowletthe was going to play the accordion that night You ought
to fetch the girls now Joe But never mind your facell go down
in about three weeks My lower jaw is crooked yet but that fight
straightened my nose that had been knocked crooked when I was a boyso
I didnt lose much beauty by it

When wed done in the shed Jack took me aside and said

Look here Joe if you wont come to the dance tonightand I cant
say youd ornament itI tell you what youll do You get little Mary
away on the quiet and take her out for a strolland act like a man The
jobs finished now and you wont get another chance like this

But how am I to get her out I said

Never you mind You be mooching round down by the big pepperminttree
near the rivergate say about halfpast ten

What goodll that do

Never you mind You just do as youre told thats all youve got to
do said Jack and he went home to get dressed and bring his wife

After the dancing started that night I had a peep in once or twice The
first time I saw Mary dancing with Jack and looking serious and the
second time she was dancing with the blarsted Jackaroo dude and looking
excited and happy I noticed that some of the girls that I could see
sitting on a stool along the opposite wall whispered and gave Mary
black looks as the Jackaroo swung her past It struck me pretty forcibly
that I should have taken fighting lessons from him instead of from poor
Romany I went away and walked about four miles down the river road
getting out of the way into the Bush whenever I saw any chap riding
along I thought of poor Romany and wondered where he was and thought
that there wasnt much to choose between us as far as happiness was
concerned Perhaps he was walking by himself in the Bush and feeling
like I did I wished I could shake hands with him

But somehow about halfpast ten I drifted back to the river sliprails
and leant over them in the shadow of the pepperminttree looking at
the rows of riverwillows in the moonlight I didnt expect anything in
spite of what Jack said

I didnt like the idea of hanging myself Id been with a party who
found a man hanging in the Bush and it was no place for a woman round
where he was And Id helped drag two bodies out of the Cudgeegong river
in a flood and they werent sleeping beauties I thought it was a pity
that a chap couldnt lie down on a grassy bank in a graceful position in
the moonlight and die just by thinking of itand die with his eyes
and mouth shut But then I remembered that I wouldnt make a beautiful
corpse anyway it went with the face I had on me

I was just getting comfortably miserable when I heard a step behind me
and my heart gave a jump And I gave a start too

Oh is that you Mr Wilson said a timid little voice

Yes I said Is that you Mary

And she said yes It was the first time I called her Mary but she did
not seem to notice it

Did I frighten you I asked

Noyesjust a little she said I didnt know there was any
one then she stopped

Why arent you dancing I asked her

Oh Im tired she said It was too hot in the woolshed I thought
Id like to come out and get my head cool and be quiet a little while

Yes I said it must be hot in the woolshed

She stood looking out over the willows Presently she said It must be
very dull for you Mr Wilsonyou must feel lonely Mr Barnes said
Then she gave a little gasp and stoppedas if she was just going to put
her foot in it

How beautiful the moonlight looks on the willows she said

Yes I said doesnt it Supposing we have a stroll by the river

Oh thank you Mr Wilson Id like it very much

I didnt notice it then but now I come to think of it it was a
beautiful scene there was a horseshoe of high blue hills round behind
the house with the river running round under the slopes and in front
was a rounded hill covered with pines and pine ridges and a soft blue
peak away over the ridges ever so far in the distance

I had a handkerchief over the worst of my face and kept the best side
turned to her We walked down by the river and didnt say anything for
a good while I was thinking hard We came to a white smooth log in a
quiet place out of sight of the house

Suppose we sit down for a while Mary I said

If you like Mr Wilson she said

There was about a foot of log between us

What a beautiful night she said

Yes I said isnt it

Presently she said I suppose you know Im going away next month Mr
Wilson

I felt suddenly empty No I said I didnt know that

Yes she said I thought you knew Im going to try and get into the
hospital to be trained for a nurse and if that doesnt come off Ill
get a place as assistant publicschool teacher

We didnt say anything for a good while

I suppose you wont be sorry to go Miss Brand I said

II dont know she said Everybodys been so kind to me here

She sat looking straight before her and I fancied her eyes glistened
I put my arm round her shoulders but she didnt seem to notice it In
fact I scarcely noticed it myself at the time

So you think youll be sorry to go away I said

Yes Mr Wilson I suppose Ill fret for a while Its been my home you
know

I pressed my hand on her shoulder just a little so as she couldnt
pretend not to know it was there But she didnt seem to notice

Ah well I said I suppose Ill be on the wallaby again next week

Will you Mr Wilson she said Her voice seemed very soft

I slipped my arm round her waist under her arm My heart was going like
clockwork now

Presently she said

Dont you think its time to go back now Mr Wilson

Oh theres plenty of time I said I shifted up and put my arm
farther round and held her closer She sat straight up looking right
in front of her but she began to breathe hard

Mary I said

Yes she said

Call me Joe I said

II dont like to she said I dont think it would be right

So I just turned her face round and kissed her She clung to me and
cried

What is it Mary I asked

She only held me tighter and cried

What is it Mary I said Aint you well Aint you happy

Yes Joe she said Im very happy Then she said Oh your poor
face Cant I do anything for it

No I said Thats all right My face doesnt hurt me a bit now

But she didnt seem right

What is it Mary I said Are you tired You didnt sleep last
night Then I got an inspiration

Mary I said what were you doing out with the gun this morning

And after some coaxing it all came out a bit hysterical

I couldnt sleepI was frightened Oh I had such a terrible dream
about you Joe I thought Romany came back and got into your room and
stabbed you with his knife I got up and dressed and about daybreak
I heard a horse at the gate then I got the gun down from the
wallandand Mr Barnes came round the corner and frightened me Hes
something like Romany you know

Then I got as much of her as I could into my arms

And oh but wasnt I happy walking home with Mary that night She was
too little for me to put my arm round her waist so I put it round
her shoulder and that felt just as good I remember I asked her whod
cleaned up my room and washed my things but she wouldnt tell

She wouldnt go back to the dance yet she said shed go into her room
and rest a while There was no one near the old verandah and when she
stood on the end of the floor she was just on a level with my shoulder

Mary I whispered put your arms round my neck and kiss me

She put her arms round my neck but she didnt kiss me she only hid her
face

Kiss me Mary I said

II dont like to she whispered

Why not Mary

Then I felt her crying or laughing or half crying and half laughing
Im not sure to this day which it was

Why wont you kiss me Mary Dont you love me

Because she said becausebecause II dontI dont think its
right forfor a girl toto kiss a man unless shes going to be his
wife

Then it dawned on me Id forgot all about proposing

Mary I said would you marry a chap like me

And that was all right

 

Next morning Mary cleared out my room and sorted out my things and
didnt take the slightest notice of the other girls astonishment

But she made me promise to speak to old Black and I did the same
evening I found him sitting on the log by the fence having a yarn on
the quiet with an old Bushman and when the old Bushman got up and went
away I sat down

Well Joe said Black I see somebodys been spoiling your face for
the dance And after a bit he said Well Joe what is it Do you want
another job If you do youll have to ask Mrs Black or Bob Bob was
his eldest son theyre managing the station for me now you know He
could be bitter sometimes in his quiet way

No I said its not that Boss

Well what is it Joe

Iwell the fact is I want little Mary

He puffed at his pipe for a long time then I thought he spoke

What did you say Boss I said

Nothing Joe he said I was going to say a lot but it wouldnt be
any use My father used to say a lot to me before I was married

I waited a good while for him to speak

Well Boss I said what about Mary

Oh I suppose thats all right Joe he said II beg your pardon I
got thinking of the days when I was courting Mrs Black




Brightens SisterInLaw


Jim was born on Gulgong New South Wales We used to say on
Gulgongand old diggers still talked of being on th Gulgongthough
the goldfield there had been worked out for years and the place was
only a dusty little pastoral town in the scrubs Gulgong was about the
last of the great alluvial rushes of the roaring daysand dreary
and dismal enough it looked when I was there The expression on came
from being on the diggings or goldfieldthe workings or the goldfield
was all underneath of course so we lived or starved ON themnot in
nor at em

Mary and I had been married about two years when Jim cameHis name
wasnt Jim by the way it was John Henry after an uncle godfather
but we called him Jim from the firstand before itbecause Jim was a
popular Bush name and most of my old mates were Jims The Bush is full
of goodhearted scamps called Jim

We lived in an old weatherboard shanty that had been a slygrogshop
and the Lord knows what else in the palmy days of Gulgong and I did
a bit of digging fossicking rather a bit of shearing a bit of
fencing a bit of Bushcarpentering tanksinkinganything just to
keep the billy boiling

We had a lot of trouble with Jim with his teeth He was bad with every
one of them and we had most of them lancedcouldnt pull him through
without I remember we got one lanced and the gum healed over before
the tooth came through and we had to get it cut again He was a plucky
little chap and after the first time he never whimpered when the doctor
was lancing his gum he used to say tar afterwards and want to bring
the lance home with him

The first turn we got with Jim was the worst I had had the wife and Jim
out camping with me in a tent at a dam I was making at Cattle Creek I
had two men working for me and a boy to drive one of the tipdrays
and I took Mary out to cook for us And it was lucky for us that the
contract was finished and we got back to Gulgong and within reach of
a doctor the day we did We were just camping in the house with our
goods and chattels anyhow for the night and we were hardly back home
an hour when Jim took convulsions for the first time

Did you ever see a child in convulsions You wouldnt want to see it
again it plays the devil with a mans nerves Id got the beds fixed up
on the floor and the billies on the fireI was going to make some tea
and put a piece of corned beef on to boil over nightwhen Jim
hed been queer all day and his mother was trying to hush him to
sleepJim he screamed out twice Hed been crying a good deal and
I was dogtired and worried over some money a man owed me or Id have
noticed at once that there was something unusual in the way the child
cried out as it was I didnt turn round till Mary screamed Joe
Joe You know how a woman cries out when her child is in danger or
dyingshort and sharp and terrible Joe Look look Oh my God our
child Get the bath quick quick its convulsions

Jim was bent back like a bow stiff as a bullockyoke in his mothers
arms and his eyeballs were turned up and fixeda thing I saw twice
afterwards and dont want ever to see again

I was falling over things getting the tub and the hot water when the
woman who lived next door rushed in She called to her husband to run
for the doctor and before the doctor came she and Mary had got Jim into
a hot bath and pulled him through

The neighbour woman made me up a shakedown in another room and stayed
with Mary that night but it was a long while before I got Jim and
Marys screams out of my head and fell asleep

You may depend I kept the fire in and a bucket of water hot over it
for a good many nights after that but it always happens like this
there came a night when the fright had worn off when I was too tired
to bother about the fire and that night Jim took us by surprise Our
woodheap was done and I broke up a new chair to get a fire and had
to run a quarter of a mile for water but this turn wasnt so bad as the
first and we pulled him through

You never saw a child in convulsions Well you dont want to It must
be only a matter of seconds but it seems long minutes and half an
hour afterwards the child might be laughing and playing with you
or stretched out dead It shook me up a lot I was always pretty
highstrung and sensitive After Jim took the first fit every time he
cried or turned over or stretched out in the night Id jump I was
always feeling his forehead in the dark to see if he was feverish or
feeling his limbs to see if he was limp yet Mary and I often laughed
about itafterwards I tried sleeping in another room but for nights
after Jims first attack Id be just dozing off into a sound sleep
when Id hear him scream as plain as could be and Id hear Mary cry
JoeJoeshort sharp and terribleand Id be up and into their
room like a shot only to find them sleeping peacefully Then Id feel
Jims head and his breathing for signs of convulsions see to the fire
and water and go back to bed and try to sleep For the first few nights
I was like that all night and Id feel relieved when daylight came
Id be in first thing to see if they were all right then Id sleep till
dinnertime if it was Sunday or I had no work But then I was run down
about that time I was worried about some money for a woolshed I put up
and never got paid for and besides Id been pretty wild before I met
Mary

I was fighting hard thenstruggling for something better Both Mary and
I were born to better things and thats what made the life so hard for
us

Jim got on all right for a while we used to watch him well and have
his teeth lanced in time

It used to hurt and worry me to see howjust as he was getting fat
and rosy and like a natural happy child and Id feel proud to take him
outa tooth would come along and hed get thin and white and pale and
biggereyed and oldfashioned Wed say Hell be safe when he gets his
eyeteeth but he didnt get them till he was two then Hell be safe
when he gets his twoyearold teeth they didnt come till he was going
on for three

He was a wonderful little chapYes I know all about parents thinking
that their child is the best in the world If your boy is small for his
age friends will say that small children make big men that hes a
very bright intelligent child and that its better to have a bright
intelligent child than a big sleepy lump of fat And if your boy is
dull and sleepy they say that the dullest boys make the cleverest
menand all the rest of it I never took any notice of that sort of
clattertook it for what it was worth but all the same I dont
think I ever saw such a child as Jim was when he turned two He was
everybodys favourite They spoilt him rather I had my own ideas about
bringing up a child I reckoned Mary was too soft with Jim Shed say
Put that whatever it was out of Jims reach will you Joe and
Id say No leave it there and make him understand hes not to have
it Make him have his meals without any nonsense and go to bed at a
regular hour Id say Mary and I had many a breeze over Jim Shed
say that I forgot he was only a baby but I held that a baby could be
trained from the first week and I believe I was right

But after all what are you to do Youll see a boy that was brought up
strict turn out a scamp and another that was dragged up anyhow by the
hair of the head as the saying is turn out well Then again when
a child is delicateand you might lose him any dayyou dont like to
spank him though he might be turning out a little fiend as delicate
children often do Suppose you gave a child a hammering and the same
night he took convulsions or something and diedhowd you feel about
it You never know what a child is going to take any more than you can
tell what some women are going to say or do

I was very fond of Jim and we were great chums Sometimes Id sit
and wonder what the deuce he was thinking about and often the way he
talked hed make me uneasy When he was two he wanted a pipe above all
things and Id get him a clean new clay and hed sit by my side on the
edge of the verandah or on a log of the woodheap in the cool of the
evening and suck away at his pipe and try to spit when he saw me do
it He seemed to understand that a cold empty pipe wasnt quite the
thing yet to have the sense to know that he couldnt smoke tobacco
yet he made the best he could of things And if he broke a clay pipe
he wouldnt have a new one and thered be a row the old one had to be
mended up somehow with string or wire If I got my hair cut hed
want his cut too and it always troubled him to see me shaveas if he
thought there must be something wrong somewhere else he ought to have
to be shaved too I lathered him one day and pretended to shave him
he sat through it as solemn as an owl but didnt seem to appreciate
itperhaps he had sense enough to know that it couldnt possibly be the
real thing He felt his face looked very hard at the lather I scraped
off and whimpered No blood daddy

I used to cut myself a good deal I was always impatient over shaving

Then he went in to interview his mother about it She understood his
lingo better than I did

But I wasnt always at ease with him Sometimes hed sit looking into
the fire with his head on one side and Id watch him and wonder what
he was thinking about I might as well have wondered what a Chinaman
was thinking about till he seemed at least twenty years older than me
sometimes when I moved or spoke hed glance round just as if to see
what that old fool of a dadda of his was doing now

I used to have a fancy that there was something Eastern or
Asiaticsomething older than our civilisation or religionabout
oldfashioned children Once I started to explain my idea to a woman I
thought would understandand as it happened she had an oldfashioned
child with very slant eyesa little tartar he was too I suppose
it was the sight of him that unconsciously reminded me of my infernal
theory and set me off on it without warning me Anyhow it got me
mixed up in an awful row with the woman and her husbandand all their
tribe It wasnt an easy thing to explain myself out of it and the row
hasnt been fixed up yet There were some Chinamen in the district

I took a goodsize fencing contract the frontage of a tenmile paddock
near Gulgong and did well out of it The railway had got as far as the
Cudgeegong riversome twenty miles from Gulgong and two hundred
from the coastand carrying was good then I had a couple of
draughthorses that I worked in the tipdrays when I was tanksinking
and one or two others running in the Bush I bought a brokendown waggon
cheap tinkered it up myselfchristened it The Same Old Thingand
started carrying from the railway terminus through Gulgong and along the
bush roads and tracks that branch out fanlike through the scrubs to the
onepub towns and sheep and cattle stations out there in the howling
wilderness It wasnt much of a team There were the two heavy horses
for shafters a stunted colt that Id bought out of the pound for
thirty shillings a light springcart horse an old grey mare with
points like a big redandwhite Australian store bullock and with the
grit of an old washerwoman to work and a horse that had spanked along
in Cob  Cos mailcoach in his time I had a couple there that didnt
belong to me I worked them for the feeding of them in the dry weather
And I had all sorts of harness that I mended and fixed up myself It
was a mixed team but I took light stuff got through pretty quick and
freight rates were high So I got along

Before this whenever I made a few pounds Id sink a shaft somewhere
prospecting for gold but Mary never let me rest till she talked me out
of that

I made up my mind to take on a small selection farmthat an old mate of
mine had fenced in and cleared and afterwards chucked upabout thirty
miles out west of Gulgong at a place called Laheys Creek The places
were all called Laheys Creek or Spicers Flat or Murphys Flat or
Ryans Crossing or some such nameround there I reckoned Id have
a run for the horses and be able to grow a bit of feed I always had a
dread of taking Mary and the children too far away from a doctoror a
good woman neighbour but there were some people came to live on Laheys
Creek and besides there was a young brother of Marysa young scamp
his name was Jim too and we called him Jimmy at first to make room
for our Jimhe hated the name Jimmy or James He came to live with
uswithout askingand I thought hed find enough work at Laheys
Creek to keep him out of mischief He wasnt to be depended on muchhe
thought nothing of riding off five hundred miles or so to have a look
at the countrybut he was fond of Mary and hed stay by her till I
got some one else to keep her company while I was on the road He would
be a protection against sundowners or any shearers who happened to
wander that way in the DTs after a spree Mary had a married sister
come to live at Gulgong just before we left and nothing would suit her
and her husband but we must leave little Jim with them for a month or
sotill we got settled down at Laheys Creek They were newly married

Mary was to have driven into Gulgong in the springcart at the end
of the month and taken Jim home but when the time came she wasnt too
welland besides the tyres of the cart were loose and I hadnt time
to get them cut so we let Jims time run on a week or so longer till I
happened to come out through Gulgong from the river with a small load of
flour for Laheys Creek way The roads were good the weather grandno
chance of it raining and I had a spare tarpaulin if it didI would
only camp out one night so I decided to take Jim home with me

Jim was turning three then and he was a cure He was so oldfashioned
that he used to frighten me sometimesId almost think that there was
something supernatural about him though of course I never took any
notice of that rot about some children being too oldfashioned to live
Theres always the ghoulish old hag and some not so old nor haggish
either wholl come round and shake up young parents with such croaks
as Youll never rear that childhes too bright for his age To the
devil with them I say

But I really thought that Jim was too intelligent for his age and I
often told Mary that he ought to be kept back and not let talk too much
to old diggers and long lanky jokers of Bushmen who rode in and hung
their horses outside my place on Sunday afternoons

I dont believe in parents talking about their own children
everlastinglyyou get sick of hearing them and their kids are
generally little devils and turn out larrikins as likely as not

But for all that I really think that Jim when he was three years old
was the most wonderful little chap in every way that I ever saw

For the first hour or so along the road he was telling me all about
his adventures at his aunties

But they spoilt me too much dad he said as solemn as a native bear
An besides a boy ought to stick to his parrans

I was taking out a cattlepup for a drover I knew and the pup took up a
good deal of Jims time

Sometimes hed jolt me the way he talked and other times Id have
to turn away my head and cough or shout at the horses to keep from
laughing outright And once when I was taken that way he said

What are you jerking your shoulders and coughing and grunting and
going on that way for dad Why dont you tell me something

Tell you what Jim

Tell me some talk

So I told him all the talk I could think of And I had to brighten up
I can tell you and not draw too much on my imaginationfor Jim was a
terror at crossexamination when the fit took him and he didnt think
twice about telling you when he thought you were talking nonsense Once
he said

Im glad you took me home with you dad Youll get to know Jim

What I said

Youll get to know Jim

But dont I know you already

No you dont You never has time to know Jim at home

And looking back I saw that it was cruel true I had known in my heart
all along that this was the truth but it came to me like a blow from
Jim You see it had been a hard struggle for the last year or so and
when I was home for a day or two I was generally too busy or too tired
and worried or full of schemes for the future to take much notice of
Jim Mary used to speak to me about it sometimes You never take notice
of the child shed say You could surely find a few minutes of an
evening Whats the use of always worrying and brooding Your brain will
go with a snap some day and if you get over it it will teach you a
lesson Youll be an old man and Jim a young one before you realise
that you had a child once Then it will be too late

This sort of talk from Mary always bored me and made me impatient with
her because I knew it all too well I never worried for myselfonly
for Mary and the children And often as the days went by I said to
myself Ill take more notice of Jim and give Mary more of my time
just as soon as I can see things clear ahead a bit And the hard days
went on and the weeks and the months and the years Ah well

Mary used to say when things would get worse Why dont you talk
to me Joe Why dont you tell me your thoughts instead of shutting
yourself up in yourself and broodingeating your heart out Its hard
for me I get to think youre tired of me and selfish I might be cross
and speak sharp to you when you are in trouble How am I to know if you
dont tell me

But I didnt think shed understand

And so getting acquainted and chumming and dozing with the gums
closing over our heads here and there and the ragged patches of
sunlight and shade passing up over the horses over us on the front of
the load over the load and down on to the white dusty road againJim
and I got along the lonely Bush road and over the ridges some fifteen
miles before sunset and camped at Ryans Crossing on Sandy Creek for
the night I got the horses out and took the harness off Jim wanted
badly to help me but I made him stay on the load for one of the
horsesa vicious redeyed chestnutwas a kicker hed broken a
mans leg I got the feedbags stretched across the shafts and the
chaffandcorn into them and there stood the horses all round with
their rumps north south and west and their heads between the shafts
munching and switching their tails We use double shafts you know for
horseteamstwo pairs side by sideand prop them up and stretch bags
between them letting the bags sag to serve as feedboxes I threw the
spare tarpaulin over the wheels on one side letting about half of
it lie on the ground in case of damp and so making a floor and a
breakwind I threw down bags and the blankets and possum rug against
the wheel to make a camp for Jim and the cattlepup and got a gincase
we used for a tuckerbox the fryingpan and billy down and made a good
fire at a log close handy and soon everything was comfortable Ryans
Crossing was a grand camp I stood with my pipe in my mouth my hands
behind my back and my back to the fire and took the country in

Reedy Creek came down along a western spur of the range the banks here
were deep and green and the water ran clear over the granite bars
boulders and gravel Behind us was a dreary flat covered with those
gnarled greybarked dryrotted native appletrees about as much
like appletrees as the native bear is like any other and a nasty bit
of sanddusty road that I was always glad to get over in wet weather
To the left on our side of the creek were reedy marshes with frogs
croaking and across the creek the dark boxscrubcovered ridges ended
in steep sidings coming down to the creekbank and to the main road
that skirted them running on west up over a saddle in the ridges and
on towards Dubbo The road by Laheys Creek to a place called Cobborah
branched off through dreary appletree and stringybark flats to the
left just beyond the crossing all these fanlike branch tracks from the
Cudgeegong were inside a big horseshoe in the Great Western Line and
so they gave small carriers a chance now that Cob  Cos coaches and
the big teams and vans had shifted out of the main western terminus
There were tall sheoaks all along the creek and a clump of big ones
over a deep waterhole just above the crossing The creek oaks have
rough barked trunks like English elms but are much taller and higher
to the branchesand the leaves are reedy Kendel the Australian
poet calls them the sheoak harps Aeolian Those trees are always
sighsighsighingmore of a sigh than a sough or the whoosh of
gumtrees in the wind You always hear them sighing even when you cant
feel any wind Its the same with telegraph wires put your head against
a telegraphpost on a dead still day and youll hear and feel the
faraway roar of the wires But then the oaks are not connected with the
distance where there might be wind and they dont ROAR in a gale only
sigh louder and softer according to the wind and never seem to go above
or below a certain pitchlike a big harp with all the strings the
same I used to have a theory that those creek oaks got the winds voice
telephoned to them so to speak through the ground

I happened to look down and there was Jim I thought he was on the
tarpaulin playing with the pup he was standing close beside me with
his legs wide apart his hands behind his back and his back to the
fire

He held his head a little on one side and there was such an old old
wise expression in his big brown eyesjust as if hed been a child for
a hundred years or so or as though he were listening to those oaks and
understanding them in a fatherly sort of way

Dad he said presentlyDad do you think Ill ever grow up to be a
man

Whwhy Jim I gasped

Because I dont want to

I couldnt think of anything against this It made me uneasy But I
remembered I used to have a childish dread of growing up to be a man

Jim I said to break the silence do you hear what the sheoaks
say

No I dont Is they talking

Yes I said without thinking

What is they saying he asked

I took the bucket and went down to the creek for some water for tea I
thought Jim would follow with a little tin billy he had but he didnt
when I got back to the fire he was again on the possum rug comforting
the pup I fried some bacon and eggs that Id brought out with me Jim
sang out from the waggon

Dont cook too much dadI mightnt be hungry

I got the tin plates and pintpots and things out on a clean new
flourbag in honour of Jim and dished up He was leaning back on the
rug looking at the pup in a listless sort of way I reckoned he was
tired out and pulled the gincase up close to him for a table and put
his plate on it But he only tried a mouthful or two and then he said

I aint hungry dad Youll have to eat it all

It made me uneasyI never liked to see a child of mine turn from his
food They had given him some tinned salmon in Gulgong and I was afraid
that that was upsetting him I was always against tinned muck

Sick Jim I asked

No dad I aint sick I dont know whats the matter with me

Have some tea sonny

Yes dad

I gave him some tea with some milk in it that Id brought in a bottle
from his aunts for him He took a sip or two and then put the pintpot
on the gincase

Jims tired dad he said

I made him lie down while I fixed up a camp for the night It had turned
a bit chilly so I let the big tarpaulin down all roundit was made to
cover a high load the flour in the waggon didnt come above the rail
so the tarpaulin came down well on to the ground I fixed Jim up a
comfortable bed under the tailend of the waggon when I went to lift
him in he was lying back looking up at the stars in a halfdreamy
halffascinated way that I didnt like Whenever Jim was extra
oldfashioned or affectionate there was danger

How do you feel now sonny

It seemed a minute before he heard me and turned from the stars

Jims better dad Then he said something like The stars are looking
at me I thought he was half asleep I took off his jacket and boots
and carried him in under the waggon and made him comfortable for the
night

Kiss me nightnight daddy he said

Id rather he hadnt asked meit was a bad sign As I was going to the
fire he called me back

What is it Jim

Get me my things and the cattlepup please daddy

I was scared now His things were some toys and rubbish hed brought
from Gulgong and I remembered the last time he had convulsions he
took all his toys and a kitten to bed with him And nightnight and
daddy were twoyearold language to Jim Id thought hed forgotten
those wordshe seemed to be going back

Are you quite warm enough Jim

Yes dad

I started to walk up and downI always did this when I was extra
worried

I was frightened now about Jim though I tried to hide the fact from
myself Presently he called me again

What is it Jim

Take the blankets off me fahverJims sick Theyd been teaching
him to say father

I was scared now I remembered a neighbour of ours had a little girl die
she swallowed a pin and when she was going she said

Take the blankets off me muvverIm dying

And I couldnt get that out of my head

I threw back a fold of the possum rug and felt Jims headhe seemed
cool enough

Where do you feel bad sonny

No answer for a while then he said suddenly but in a voice as if he
were talking in his sleep

Put my boots on please daddy I want to go home to muvver

I held his hand and comforted him for a while then he sleptin a
restless feverish sort of way

I got the bucket I used for water for the horses and stood it over the
fire I ran to the creek with the big kerosenetin bucket and got
it full of cold water and stood it handy I got the spade we always
carried one to dig wheels out of bogs in wet weather and turned a
corner of the tarpaulin back dug a hole and trod the tarpaulin down
into the hole to serve for a bath in case of the worst I had a tin of
mustard and meant to fight a good round for Jim if death came along

I stooped in under the tailboard of the waggon and felt Jim His head
was burning hot and his skin parched and dry as a bone

Then I lost nerve and started blundering backward and forward between
the waggon and the fire and repeating what Id heard Mary say the last
time we fought for Jim God dont take my child God dont take my
boy Id never had much faith in doctors but my God I wanted one
then The nearest was fifteen miles away

I threw back my head and stared up at the branches in desperation
andWell I dont ask you to take much stock in this though most old
Bushmen will believe anything of the Bush by night andNow it might
have been that I was all unstrung or it might have been a patch of sky
outlined in the gently moving branches or the blue smoke rising up But
I saw the figure of a woman all white come down down nearly to the
limbs of the trees point on up the main road and then float up and up
and vanish still pointing I thought Mary was dead Then it flashed on
me

Four or five miles up the road over the saddle was an old shanty
that had been a halfway inn before the Great Western Line got round as
far as Dubbo and took the coach traffic off those old Bush roads A man
named Brighten lived there He was a selector did a little farming
and as much slygrog selling as he could He was marriedbut it wasnt
that Id thought of them but she was a childish wornout spiritless
woman and both were pretty ratty from hardship and lonelinessthey
werent likely to be of any use to me But it was this Id heard talk
among some women in Gulgong of a sister of Brightens wife whod gone
out to live with them lately shed been a hospital matron in the city
they said and there were yarns about her Some said she got the sack
for exposing the doctorsor carrying on with themI didnt remember
which The fact of a city woman going out to live in such a place with
such people was enough to make talk among women in a town twenty miles
away but then there must have been something extra about her else
Bushmen wouldnt have talked and carried her name so far and I wanted
a woman out of the ordinary now I even reasoned this way thinking
like lightning as I knelt over Jim between the big back wheels of the
waggon

I had an old racing mare that I used as a riding hack following the
team In a minute I had her saddled and bridled I tied the end of a
halffull chaffbag shook the chaff into each end and dumped it on to
the pommel as a cushion or buffer for Jim I wrapped him in a blanket
and scrambled into the saddle with him

The next minute we were stumbling down the steep bank clattering and
splashing over the crossing and struggling up the opposite bank to the
level The mare as I told you was an old racer but brokenwindedshe
must have run without wind after the first half mile She had the old
racing instinct in her strong and whenever I rode in company Id have
to pull her hard else shed race the other horse or burst She ran low
fore and aft and was the easiest horse I ever rode She ran like
wheels on rails with a bit of a tremble now and thenlike a railway
carriagewhen she settled down to it

The chaffbag had slipped off in the creek I suppose and I let the
bridlerein go and held Jim up to me like a baby the whole way Let the
strongest man who isnt used to it hold a baby in one position for
five minutesand Jim was fairly heavy But I never felt the ache in my
arms that nightit must have gone before I was in a fit state of mind
to feel it And at home Id often growled about being asked to hold the
baby for a few minutes I could never brood comfortably and nurse a baby
at the same time It was a ghostly moonlight night Theres no timber in
the world so ghostly as the Australian Bush in moonlightor just about
daybreak The allshaped patches of moonlight falling between ragged
twisted boughs the ghostly bluewhite bark of the whitebox trees a
dead naked white ringbarked tree or dead white stump starting out here
and there and the ragged patches of shade and light on the road that
made anything from the shape of a spotted bullock to a naked
corpse laid out stark Roads and tracks through the Bush made by
moonlightevery one seeming straighter and clearer than the real one
you have to trust to your horse then Sometimes the naked white trunk of
a red stringybark tree where a sheet of bark had been taken off would
start out like a ghost from the dark Bush And dew or frost glistening
on these things according to the season Now and again a great grey
kangaroo that had been feeding on a green patch down by the road would
start with a thumpthump and away up the siding

The Bush seemed full of ghosts that nightall going my wayand being
left behind by the mare Once I stopped to look at Jim I just sat
back and the mare proppedshed been a stockhorse and was used
to cuttingout I felt Jims hands and forehead he was in a burning
fever I bent forward and the old mare settled down to it again I kept
saying out loudand Mary and me often laughed about it afterwards
Hes limp yetJims limp yet the words seemed jerked out of me by
sheer frightHes limp yet till the mares feet took it up Then
just when I thought she was doing her best and racing her hardest she
suddenly started forward like a cable tram gliding along on its own and
the grip put on suddenly It was just what shed do when Id be riding
alone and a strange horse drew up from behindthe old racing instinct
I FELT the thing too I felt as if a strange horse WAS there And
thenthe words just jerked out of me by sheer funkI started saying
Death is riding tonight Death is racing tonight Death is
riding tonight till the hoofs took that up And I believe the old
mare felt the black horse at her side and was going to beat him or break
her heart

I was mad with anxiety and fright I remember I kept saying Ill be
kinder to Mary after this Ill take more notice of Jim and the rest
of it

I dont know how the old mare got up the last pinch She must have
slackened pace but I never noticed it I just held Jim up to me and
gripped the saddle with my kneesI remember the saddle jerked from the
desperate jumps of her till I thought the girth would go We topped the
gap and were going down into a gully they called Dead Mans Hollow and
there at the back of a ghostly clearing that opened from the road
where there were some blacksoil springs was a long low oblong
weatherboardandshingle building with blind broken windows in the
gableends and a wide steep verandah roof slanting down almost to the
level of the windowsillsthere was something sinister about it I
thoughtlike the hat of a jailbird slouched over his eyes The place
looked both deserted and haunted I saw no light but that was because
of the moonlight outside The mare turned in at the corner of the
clearing to take a short cut to the shanty and as she struggled across
some marshy ground my heart kept jerking out the words Its deserted
Theyve gone away Its deserted The mare went round to the back and
pulled up between the back door and a big barkandslab kitchen Some
one shouted from inside

Whos there

Its me Joe Wilson I want your sisterinlawIve got the boyhes
sick and dying

Brighten came out pulling up his moleskins What boy he asked

Here take him I shouted and let me get down

Whats the matter with him asked Brighten and he seemed to hang
back And just as I made to get my leg over the saddle Jims head went
back over my arm he stiffened and I saw his eyeballs turned up and
glistening in the moonlight

I felt cold all over then and sick in the stomachbut CLEARHEADED in
a way strange wasnt it I dont know why I didnt get down and rush
into the kitchen to get a bath ready I only felt as if the worst had
come and I wished it were over and gone I even thought of Mary and the
funeral

Then a woman ran out of the housea big hardlooking woman She had
on a wrapper of some sort and her feet were bare She laid her hand on
Jim looked at his face and then snatched him from me and ran into the
kitchenand me down and after her As great good luck would have it
they had some dirty clothes on to boil in a kerosene tindishcloths or
something

Brightens sisterinlaw dragged a tub out from under the table
wrenched the bucket off the hook and dumped in the water dishcloths
and all snatched a can of cold water from a corner dashed that in
and felt the water with her handholding Jim up to her hip all the
timeand I wont say how he looked She stood him in the tub and
started dashing water over him tearing off his clothes between the
splashes

Here that tin of mustardthere on the shelf she shouted to me

She knocked the lid off the tin on the edge of the tub and went on
splashing and spanking Jim

It seemed an eternity And I Why I never thought clearer in my life I
felt coldbloodedI felt as if Id like an excuse to go outside till
it was all over I thought of Mary and the funeraland wished that that
was past All this in a flash as it were I felt that it would be a
great relief and only wished the funeral was months past I feltwell
altogether selfish I only thought for myself

Brightens sisterinlaw splashed and spanked him hardhard enough to
break his back I thought andafter about half an hour it seemedthe
end came Jims limbs relaxed he slipped down into the tub and the
pupils of his eyes came down They seemed dull and expressionless like
the eyes of a new baby but he was back for the world again

I dropped on the stool by the table

Its all right she said Its all over now I wasnt going to let
him die I was only thinking Well its over now but it will come on
again I wish it was over for good Im tired of it

She called to her sister Mrs Brighten a washedout helpless little
fool of a woman whod been running in and out and whimpering all the
time

Here Jessie bring the new white blanket off my bed And you
Brighten take some of that wood off the fire and stuff something in
that hole there to stop the draught

Brightenhe was a nuggety little hairy man with no expression to be
seen for whiskershad been running in with sticks and back logs from
the woodheap He took the wood out stuffed up the crack and went
inside and brought out a black bottlegot a cup from the shelf and put
both down near my elbow

Mrs Brighten started to get some supper or breakfast or whatever it
was ready She had a clean cloth and set the table tidily I noticed
that all the tins were polished bright old coffee and mustardtins
and the like that they used instead of sugarbasins and teacaddies and
saltcellars and the kitchen was kept as clean as possible She was
all right at little things I knew a haggard workedout Bushwoman who
put her whole soulor all shed got leftinto polishing old tins till
they dazzled your eyes

I didnt feel inclined for corned beef and damper and postandrail
tea So I sat and squinted when I thought she wasnt looking at
Brightens sisterinlaw She was a big woman her hands and feet were
big but wellshaped and all in proportionthey fitted her She was a
handsome womanabout forty I should think She had a square chin and
a straight thinlipped mouthstraight save for a hint of a turn down
at the corners which I fancied and I have strange fancies had been a
sign of weakness in the days before she grew hard There was no sign
of weakness now She had hard grey eyes and blueblack hair She hadnt
spoken yet She didnt ask me how the boy took ill or I got there or
who or what I wasat least not until the next evening at teatime

She sat upright with Jim wrapped in the blanket and laid across her
knees with one hand under his neck and the other laid lightly on him
and she just rocked him gently

She sat looking hard and straight before her just as Ive seen a tired
needlewoman sit with her work in her lap and look away back into the
past And Jim might have been the work in her lap for all she seemed to
think of him Now and then she knitted her forehead and blinked

Suddenly she glanced round and saidin a tone as if I was her husband
and she didnt think much of me

Why dont you eat something

Beg pardon

Eat something

I drank some tea and sneaked another look at her I was beginning to
feel more natural and wanted Jim again now that the colour was coming
back into his face and he didnt look like an unnaturally stiff and
staring corpse I felt a lump rising and wanted to thank her I sneaked
another look at her

She was staring straight before herI never saw a womans face change
so suddenlyI never saw a womans eyes so haggard and hopeless Then
her great chest heaved twice I heard her draw a long shuddering breath
like a knockedout horse and two great tears dropped from her wide
open eyes down her cheeks like raindrops on a face of stone And in the
firelight they seemed tinged with blood

I looked away quick feeling full up myself And presently I hadnt
seen her look round she said

Go to bed

Beg pardon Her face was the same as before the tears

Go to bed Theres a bed made for you inside on the sofa

Butthe teamI must

What

The team I left it at the camp I must look to it

Oh Well Brighten will ride down and bring it up in the morningor
send the halfcaste Now you go to bed and get a good rest The boy
will be all right Ill see to that

I went outit was a relief to get outand looked to the mare Brighten
had got her some corn and chaff in a candlebox but she couldnt eat
yet She just stood or hung resting one hindleg and then the other
with her nose over the boxand she sobbed I put my arms round her neck
and my face down on her ragged mane and cried for the second time since
I was a boy

  Maize or Indian cornwheat is never called corn in
 Australia

As I started to go in I heard Brightens sisterinlaw say suddenly and
sharply

Take THAT away Jessie

And presently I saw Mrs Brighten go into the house with the black
bottle

The moon had gone behind the range I stood for a minute between the
house and the kitchen and peeped in through the kitchen window

She had moved away from the fire and sat near the table She bent over
Jim and held him up close to her and rocked herself to and fro

I went to bed and slept till the next afternoon I woke just in time
to hear the tailend of a conversation between Jim and Brightens
sisterinlaw He was asking her out to our place and she promising to
come

And now says Jim I want to go home to muffer in The Same Ol
Fling

What

Jim repeated

Oh The Same Old Thingthe waggon

The rest of the afternoon I poked round the gullies with old Brighten
looking at some indications of the existence of gold he had found
It was no use trying to pump him concerning his sisterinlaw
Brighten was an old hand and had learned in the old Bushranging and
cattlestealing days to know nothing about other peoples business And
by the way I noticed then that the more you talk and listen to a bad
character the more you lose your dislike for him

I never saw such a change in a woman as in Brightens sisterinlaw
that evening She was bright and jolly and seemed at least ten years
younger She bustled round and helped her sister to get tea ready She
rooted out some old china that Mrs Brighten had stowed away somewhere
and set the table as I seldom saw it set out there She propped Jim up
with pillows and laughed and played with him like a great girl She
described Sydney and Sydney life as Id never heard it described before
and she knew as much about the Bush and old digging days as I did She
kept old Brighten and me listening and laughing till nearly midnight
And she seemed quick to understand everything when I talked If she
wanted to explain anything that we hadnt seen she wouldnt say that it
was like alike aand hesitate you know what I mean shed hit the
right thing on the head at once A squatter with a very round flaming
red face and a white cork hat had gone by in the afternoon she said
it was like a mushroom on the rising moon She gave me a lot of good
hints about children

But she was quiet again next morning I harnessed up and she dressed
Jim and gave him his breakfast and made a comfortable place for him
on the load with the possum rug and a spare pillow She got up on the
wheel to do it herself Then was the awkward time Id half start to
speak to her and then turn away and go fixing up round the horses and
then make another false start to say goodbye At last she took Jim up
in her arms and kissed him and lifted him on the wheel but he put his
arms tight round her neck and kissed hera thing Jim seldom did
with anybody except his mother for he wasnt what youd call an
affectionate childhed never more than offer his cheek to me in his
oldfashioned way Id got up the other side of the load to take him
from her

Here take him she said

I saw his mouth twitching as I lifted him Jim seldom cried nowadaysno
matter how much he was hurt I gained some time fixing Jim comfortable

Youd better make a start she said You want to get home early with
that boy

I got down and went round to where she stood I held out my hand and
tried to speak but my voice went like an ungreased waggon wheel and I
gave it up and only squeezed her hand

Thats all right she said then tears came into her eyes and she
suddenly put her hand on my shoulder and kissed me on the cheek You be
offyoure only a boy yourself Take care of that boy be kind to your
wife and take care of yourself

Will you come to see us

Some day she said

I started the horses and looked round once more She was looking up at
Jim who was waving his hand to her from the top of the load And I saw
that haggard hungry hopeless look come into her eyes in spite of the
tears


I smoothed over that story and shortened it a lot when I told it to
MaryI didnt want to upset her But some time after I brought Jim
home from Gulgong and while I was at home with the team for a few days
nothing would suit Mary but she must go over to Brightens shanty and
see Brightens sisterinlaw So James drove her over one morning in the
springcart it was a long way and they stayed at Brightens overnight
and didnt get back till late the next afternoon Id got the place in a
pigmuck as Mary said doing for myself and I was having a snooze
on the sofa when they got back The first thing I remember was some one
stroking my head and kissing me and I heard Mary saying My poor boy
My poor old boy

I sat up with a jerk I thought that Jim had gone off again But it
seems that Mary was only referring to me Then she started to pull grey
hairs out of my head and put em in an empty matchboxto see how many
shed get She used to do this when she felt a bit soft I dont
know what she said to Brightens sisterinlaw or what Brightens
sisterinlaw said to her but Mary was extra gentle for the next few
days




Water Them Geraniums




I A Lonely Track


The time Mary and I shifted out into the Bush from Gulgong to settle on
the land at Laheys Creek

Id sold the two tipdrays that I used for tanksinking and dammaking
and I took the traps out in the waggon on top of a small load of rations
and horsefeed that I was taking to a sheepstation out that way Mary
drove out in the springcart You remember we left little Jim with
his aunt in Gulgong till we got settled down Id sent James Marys
brother out the day before on horseback with two or three cows and
some heifers and steers and calves we had and Id told him to clean up
a bit and make the hut as bright and cheerful as possible before Mary
came

We hadnt much in the way of furniture There was the fourposter cedar
bedstead that I bought before we were married and Mary was rather proud
of it it had turned posts and joints that bolted together There was
a plain hardwood table that Mary called her ironingtable upside
down on top of the load with the bedding and blankets between the
legs there were four of those common black kitchenchairswith apples
painted on the hard board backsthat we used for the parlour there was
a cheap batten sofa with arms at the ends and turned rails between the
uprights of the arms we were a little proud of the turned rails and
there was the campoven and the threelegged pot and pans and buckets
stuck about the load and hanging under the tailboard of the waggon

There was the little Wilcox  Gibbs sewingmachinemy present to Mary
when we were married and what a present looking back to it There
was a cheap little rockingchair and a lookingglass and some
pictures that were presents from Marys friends and sister She had her
mantelshelf ornaments and crockery and nicknacks packed away in the
linen and old clothes in a big tub made of half a cask and a box
that had been Jims cradle The live stock was a cat in one box and in
another an old rooster and three hens that formed cliques two against
one turn about as three of the same sex will do all over the world I
had my old cattledog and of course a pup on the loadI always had a
pup that I gave away or sold and didnt get paid for or had touched
stolen as soon as it was old enough James had his three spidery
sneaking thieving coldblooded kangaroodogs with him I was taking
out three months provisions in the way of rationsugar tea flour and
potatoes c

I started early and Mary caught up to me at Ryans Crossing on Sandy
Creek where we boiled the billy and had some dinner

Mary bustled about the camp and admired the scenery and talked too much
for her and was extra cheerful and kept her face turned from me as
much as possible I soon saw what was the matter Shed been crying
to herself coming along the road I thought it was all on account of
leaving little Jim behind for the first time She told me that she
couldnt make up her mind till the last moment to leave him and that
a mile or two along the road shed have turned back for him only that
she knew her sister would laugh at her She was always terribly anxious
about the children

We cheered each other up and Mary drove with me the rest of the way
to the creek along the lonely branch track across nativeappletree
flats It was a dreary hopeless track There was no horizon nothing
but the rough ashen trunks of the gnarled and stunted trees in all
directions little or no undergrowth and the ground save for the
coarse brownish tufts of dead grass as bare as the road for it was
a dry season there had been no rain for months and I wondered what I
should do with the cattle if there wasnt more grass on the creek

In this sort of country a stranger might travel for miles without
seeming to have moved for all the difference there is in the scenery
The new tracks were blazedthat is slices of bark cut off from both
sides of trees within sight of each other in a line to mark the track
until the horses and wheelmarks made it plain A smart Bushman with
a sharp tomahawk can blaze a track as he rides But a Bushman a little
used to the country soon picks out differences amongst the trees half
unconsciously as it were and so finds his way about

Mary and I didnt talk much along this trackwe couldnt have heard
each other very well anyway for the clockclock of the waggon and
the rattle of the cart over the hard lumpy ground And I suppose we
both began to feel pretty dismal as the shadows lengthened Id noticed
lately that Mary and I had got out of the habit of talking to each
othernoticed it in a vague sort of way that irritated me as vague
things will irritate one when I thought of it But then I thought It
wont last longIll make life brighter for her byandby

As we went alongand the track seemed endlessI got brooding of
course back into the past And I feel now when its too late that
Mary must have been thinking that way too I thought of my early
boyhood of the hard life of grubbin and milkin and fencin and
ploughin and ringbarkin c and all for nothing The few months
at the little barkschool with a teacher who couldnt spell The cursed
ambition or craving that tortured my soul as a boyambition or craving
forI didnt know what for For something better and brighter anyhow
And I made the life harder by reading at night

It all passed before me as I followed on in the waggon behind Mary in
the springcart I thought of these old things more than I thought of
her She had tried to help me to better things And I tried tooI had
the energy of halfadozen men when I saw a road clear before me
but shied at the first check Then I brooded or dreamed of making a
homethat one might call a homefor Marysome day Ah well

And what was Mary thinking about along the lonely changeless miles I
never thought of that Of her kind careless gentleman father perhaps
Of her girlhood Of her homesnot the huts and camps she lived in with
me Of our futureshe used to plan a lot and talk a good deal of our
futurebut not lately These things didnt strike me at the timeI was
so deep in my own brooding Did she think nowdid she begin to feel
now that she had made a great mistake and thrown away her life but must
make the best of it This might have roused me had I thought of it But
whenever I thought Mary was getting indifferent towards me Id think
Ill soon win her back Well be sweethearts againwhen things
brighten up a bit

Its an awful thing to me now I look back to it to think how far apart
we had grown what strangers we were to each other It seems now as
though we had been sweethearts long years before and had parted and
had never really met since

The sun was going down when Mary called out

Theres our place Joe

She hadnt seen it before and somehow it came new and with a shock to
me who had been out here several times Ahead through the trees to
the right was a dark green clump of the oaks standing out of the creek
darker for the dead grey grass and bluegrey bush on the barren ridge in
the background Across the creek it was only a deep narrow guttera
watercourse with a chain of waterholes after rain across on the
other bank stood the hut on a narrow flat between the spur and the
creek and a little higher than this side The land was much better than
on our old selection and there was good soil along the creek on both
sides I expected a rush of selectors out here soon A few acres round
the hut was cleared and fenced in by a light tworail fence of timber
split from logs and saplings The man who took up this selection left it
because his wife died here

It was a small oblong hut built of split slabs and he had roofed it
with shingles which he split in spare times There was no verandah but
I built one later on At the end of the house was a big slabandbark
shed bigger than the hut itself with a kitchen a skillion for tools
harness and horsefeed and a spare bedroom partitioned off with sheets
of bark and old chaffbags The house itself was floored roughly with
cracks between the boards there were cracks between the slabs all
roundthough hed nailed strips of tin from old kerosenetins over
some of them the partitionedoff bedroom was lined with old chaffbags
with newspapers pasted over them for wallpaper There was no ceiling
calico or otherwise and we could see the round pine rafters and
battens and the under ends of the shingles But ceilings make a hut hot
and harbour insects and reptilessnakes sometimes There was one
small glass window in the diningroom with three panes and a sheet
of greased paper and the rest were rough wooden shutters There was a
pretty good cowyard and calfpen andthat was about all There was
no dam or tank I made one later on there was a watercask with the
hoops falling off and the staves gaping at the corner of the house and
spouting made of lengths of bent tin ran round under the eaves Water
from a new shingle roof is winered for a year or two and water from
a stringybark roof is like tanwater for years In dry weather the
selector had got his house water from a cask sunk in the gravel at
the bottom of the deepest waterhole in the creek And the longer the
drought lasted the farther he had to go down the creek for his water
with a cask on a cart and take his cows to drink if he had any Four
five six or seven mileseven ten miles to water is nothing in some
places


James hadnt found himself called upon to do more than milk old Spot
the grandmother cow of our mob pen the calf at night make a fire
in the kitchen and sweep out the house with a bough He helped me
unharness and water and feed the horses and then started to get the
furniture off the waggon and into the house James wasnt lazyso
long as one thing didnt last too long but he was too uncomfortably
practical and matteroffact for me Mary and I had some tea in the
kitchen The kitchen was permanently furnished with a table of split
slabs adzed smooth on top and supported by four stakes driven into the
ground a threelegged stool and a block of wood and two long
stools made of halfround slabs sapling trunks split in halves with
augerholes bored in the round side and sticks stuck into them for legs
The floor was of clay the chimney of slabs and tin the fireplace
was about eight feet wide lined with clay and with a blackened pole
across with sooty chains and wire hooks on it for the pots

Mary didnt seem able to eat She sat on the threelegged stool near the
fire though it was warm weather and kept her face turned from me
Mary was still pretty but not the little dumpling she had been she was
thinner now She had big dark hazel eyes that shone a little too much
when she was pleased or excited I thought at times that there was
something very German about her expression also something aristocratic
about the turn of her nose which nipped in at the nostrils when she
spoke There was nothing aristocratic about me Mary was German in
figure and walk I used sometimes to call her Little Duchy and Pigeon
Toes She had a will of her own as shown sometimes by the obstinate
knit in her forehead between the eyes

Mary sat still by the fire and presently I saw her chin tremble

What is it Mary

She turned her face farther from me I felt tired disappointed and
irritatedsuffering from a reaction

Now what is it Mary I asked Im sick of this sort of thing
Havent you got everything you wanted Youve had your own way Whats
the matter with you now

You know very well Joe

But I DONT know I said I knew too well

She said nothing

Look here Mary I said putting my hand on her shoulder dont go on
like that tell me whats the matter

Its only this she said suddenly I cant stand this life here it
will kill me

I had a pannikin of tea in my hand and I banged it down on the table

This is more than a man can stand I shouted You know very well that
it was you that dragged me out here You run me on to this Why werent
you content to stay in Gulgong

And what sort of a place was Gulgong Joe asked Mary quietly

I thought even then in a flash what sort of a place Gulgong was A
wretched remnant of a town on an abandoned goldfield One street each
side of the dusty main road three or four onestorey square brick
cottages with hip roofs of galvanised iron that glared in the heatfour
rooms and a passagethe policestation bankmanager and schoolmasters
cottages c Halfadozen tumbledown weatherboard shantiesthe three
pubs the two stores and the postoffice The town tailing off into
weatherboard boxes with tin tops and old bark hutsrelics of the
digging dayspropped up by many rotting poles The men when at home
mostly asleep or droning over their pipes or hanging about the verandah
posts of the pubs saying Ullo Bill or Ullo Jimor
sometimes drunk The women mostly hags who blackened each others and
girls characters with their tongues and criticised the aristocracys
washing hung out on the line And the colour of the clothes Does that
woman wash her clothes at all or only soak em and hang em outthat
was Gulgong

Well why didnt you come to Sydney as I wanted you to I asked Mary

You know very well Joe said Mary quietly

I knew very well but the knowledge only maddened me I had had an idea
of getting a billet in one of the big woolstoresI was a fair wool
expertbut Mary was afraid of the drink I could keep well away from it
so long as I worked hard in the Bush I had gone to Sydney twice since
I met Mary once before we were married and she forgave me when I came
back and once afterwards I got a billet there then and was going to
send for her in a month After eight weeks she raised the money somehow
and came to Sydney and brought me home I got pretty low down that
time

But Mary I said it would have been different this time You would
have been with me I can take a glass now or leave it alone

As long as you take a glass there is danger she said

Well what did you want to advise me to come out here for if you cant
stand it Why didnt you stay where you were I asked

Well she said why werent you more decided

Id sat down but I jumped to my feet then

Good God I shouted this is more than any man can stand Ill chuck
it all up Im damned well sick and tired of the whole thing

So am I Joe said Mary wearily

We quarrelled badly thenthat first hour in our new home I know now
whose fault it was

I got my hat and went out and started to walk down the creek I didnt
feel bitter against MaryI had spoken too cruelly to her to feel that
way Looking back I could see plainly that if I had taken her advice
all through instead of now and again things would have been all right
with me I had come away and left her crying in the hut and James
telling her in a brotherly way that it was all her fault The trouble
was that I never liked to give in or go halfway to make it upnot
halfwayit was all the way or nothing with our natures

If I dont make a stand now Id say Ill never be master I gave up
the reins when I got married and Ill have to get them back again

What women some men are But the time came and not many years after
when I stood by the bed where Mary lay white and still and amongst
other things I kept saying Ill give in MaryIll give in and
then Id laugh They thought that I was raving mad and took me from the
room But that time was to come

As I walked down the creek track in the moonlight the question rang in
my ears again as it had done when I first caught sight of the house
that evening

Why did I bring her here

I was not fit to go on the land The place was only fit for some
stolid German or Scotsman or even Englishman and his wife who had no
ambition but to bullock and make a farm of the place I had only drifted
here through carelessness brooding and discontent

I walked on and on till I was more than halfway to the only
neighboursa wretched selectors family about four miles down the
creekand I thought Id go on to the house and see if they had any
fresh meat

A mile or two farther I saw the loom of the bark hut they lived in on
a patchy clearing in the scrub and heard the voice of the selectors
wifeI had seen her several times she was a gaunt haggard Bushwoman
and I supposed the reason why she hadnt gone mad through hardship
and loneliness was that she hadnt either the brains or the memory to go
farther than she could see through the trunks of the appletrees

You Annay Annie

Yees from somewhere in the gloom

Didnt I tell yer to water them geraniums

Well didnt I

Dont tell lies or Ill break yer young back

I did I tell yerthe water wont soak inter the ashes

Geraniums were the only flowers I saw grow in the drought out there
I remembered this woman had a few dirty greygreen leaves behind some
sticks against the bark wall near the door and in spite of the sticks
the fowls used to get in and scratch beds under the geraniums and
scratch dust over them and ashes were thrown therewith an idea of
helping the flower I suppose and greasy dishwater when fresh water
was scarcetill you might as well try to water a dish of fat

Then the womans voice again

You Tommay Tommy

Silence save for an echo on the ridge

You TomMAY

Yees shrill shriek from across the creek

Didnt I tell you to ride up to them new people and see if they want
any meat or any think in one long screech

WellI karnt find the horse

Wellfinditfirstthinkinthemorning and
AnddontforgittotellMrsWisonthatmotherllbeupassoonasshecan


I didnt feel like going to the womans house that night I feltand
the thought came like a whipstroke on my heartthat this was what Mary
would come to if I left her here

I turned and started to walk home fast Id made up my mind Id take
Mary straight back to Gulgong in the morningI forgot about the load I
had to take to the sheep station Id say Look here Girlie thats
what I used to call her well leave this wretched life well leave
the Bush for ever Well go to Sydney and Ill be a man and work my
way up And Id sell waggon horses and all and go

When I got to the hut it was lighted up Mary had the only kerosene
lamp a slush lamp and two tallow candles going She had got both rooms
washed outto Jamess disgust for he had to move the furniture and
boxes about She had a lot of things unpacked on the table she had
laid clean newspapers on the mantelshelfa slab on two pegs over the
fireplaceand put the little wooden clock in the centre and some of
the ornaments on each side and was tacking a strip of vandyked American
oilcloth round the rough edge of the slab

How does that look Joe Well soon get things shipshape

I kissed her but she had her mouth full of tacks I went out in the
kitchen drank a pint of cold tea and sat down

Somehow I didnt feel satisfied with the way things had gone




II Past Carin


Next morning things looked a lot brighter Things always look brighter
in the morningmore so in the Australian Bush I should think than in
most other places It is when the sun goes down on the dark bed of the
lonely Bush and the sunset flashes like a sea of fire and then fades
and then glows out again like a bank of coals and then burns away to
ashesit is then that old things come home to one And strange newold
things too that haunt and depress you terribly and that you cant
understand I often think how at sunset the past must come home to
newchum blacksheep sent out to Australia and drifted into the Bush
I used to think that they couldnt have much brains or the loneliness
would drive them mad

Id decided to let James take the team for a trip or two He could drive
alright he was a better business man and no doubt would manage better
than meas long as the novelty lasted and Id stay at home for a
week or so till Mary got used to the place or I could get a girl from
somewhere to come and stay with her The first weeks or few months of
loneliness are the worst as a rule I believe as they say the first
weeks in jail areI was never there I know its so with tramping or
hard graft the first day or two are twice as hard as any of the rest
But for my part I could never get used to loneliness and dulness the
last days used to be the worst with me then Id have to make a move or
drink When youve been too much and too long alone in a lonely place
you begin to do queer things and think queer thoughtsprovided you have
any imagination at all Youll sometimes sit of an evening and watch the
lonely track by the hour for a horseman or a cart or some one thats
never likely to come that waysome one or a stranger that you cant
and dont really expect to see I think that most men who have been
alone in the Bush for any length of timeand married couples tooare
more or less mad With married couples it is generally the husband who
is painfully shy and awkward when strangers come The woman seems to
stand the loneliness better and can hold her own with strangers as a
rule Its only afterwards and looking back that you see how queer you
got Shepherds and boundaryriders who are alone for months MUST have
their periodical spree at the nearest shanty else theyd go raving
mad Drink is the only break in the awful monotony and the yearly or
halfyearly spree is the only thing theyve got to look forward to it
keeps their minds fixed on something definite ahead

  Graft work The term is now applied in Australia to
 all sorts of work from bullockdriving to writing poetry

But Mary kept her head pretty well through the first months of
loneliness WEEKS rather I should say for it wasnt as bad as it
might have been farther upcountry there was generally some one came
of a Sunday afternoona springcart with a couple of women or maybe
a familyor a lanky shy Bush native or two on lanky shy horses On
a quiet Sunday after Id brought Jim home Mary would dress him and
herselfjust the same as if we were in townand make me get up on one
end and put on a collar and take her and Jim for a walk along the creek
She said she wanted to keep me civilised She tried to make a gentleman
of me for years but gave it up gradually

Well It was the first morning on the creek I was greasing the
waggonwheels and James out after the horse and Mary hanging out
clothes in an old print dress and a big ugly white hood when I heard
her being hailed as Hi missus from the front sliprails

It was a boy on horseback He was a lighthaired very much freckled boy
of fourteen or fifteen with a small head but with limbs especially
his bare sunblotched shanks that might have belonged to a grown
man He had a good face and frank grey eyes An old nearly black
cabbagetree hat rested on the butts of his ears turning them out at
right angles from his head and rather dirty sprouts they were He wore
a dirty torn Crimean shirt and a pair of mans moleskin trousers rolled
up above the knees with the wide waistband gathered under a greenhide
belt I noticed later on that even when he wore trousers short enough
for him he always rolled em up above the knees when on horseback for
some reason of his own to suggest leggings perhaps for he had them
rolled up in all weathers and he wouldnt have bothered to save them
from the sweat of the horse even if that horse ever sweated

He was seated astride a threebushel bag thrown across the ridgepole of
a big grey horse with a coffinshaped head and built astern something
after the style of a roughly put up hiproofed boxbark humpy His
colour was like old boxbark too a dirty bluishgrey and one time
when I saw his rump looming out of the scrub I really thought it was
some old shepherds hut that I hadnt noticed there before When he
cantered it was like the humpy starting off on its cornerposts

  Humpy a rough hut

Are you Mrs Wilson asked the boy

Yes said Mary

Well mother told me to ride acrost and see if you wanted anythink We
killed lars night and Ive fetched a piece er cow

Piece of WHAT asked Mary

He grinned and handed a sugarbag across the rail with something heavy
in the bottom of it that nearly jerked Marys arm out when she took
it It was a piece of beef that looked as if it had been cut off with a
woodaxe but it was fresh and clean

Oh Im so glad cried Mary She was always impulsive save to me
sometimes I was just wondering where we were going to get any fresh
meat How kind of your mother Tell her Im very much obliged to her
indeed And she felt behind her for a poor little purse she had And
nowhow much did your mother say it would be

The boy blinked at her and scratched his head

How much will it be he repeated puzzled Ohhow much does it weigh
Isposeyermean Well it aint been weighed at allwe aint got no
scales A butcher does all that sort of think We just kills it and
cooks it and eats itand goes by guess What wont keep we salts down
in the cask I reckon it weighs about a ton by the weight of it if yer
wanter know Mother thought that if she sent any more it would go bad
before you could scoff it I cant see

Yes yes said Mary getting confused But what I want to know is
how do you manage when you sell it

He glared at her and scratched his head Sell it Why we only goes
halves in a steer with some one or sells steers to the butcheror
maybe some meat to a party of fencers or surveyors or tanksinkers or
them sorter people

Yes yes but what I want to know is how much am I to send your mother
for this

How much what

Money of course you stupid boy said Mary You seem a very stupid
boy

Then he saw what she was driving at He began to fling his heels
convulsively against the sides of his horse jerking his body backward
and forward at the same time as if to wind up and start some clockwork
machinery inside the horse that made it go and seemed to need
repairing or oiling

We aint that sorter people missus he said We dont sell meat
to new people that come to settle here Then jerking his thumb
contemptuously towards the ridges Go over ter Walls if yer wanter buy
meat they sell meat ter strangers Wall was the big squatter over the
ridges

Oh said Mary Im SO sorry Thank your mother for me She IS kind

Oh thats nothink She said to tell yer shell be up as soon as she
can Shed have come up yisterday eveningshe thought yerd feel lonely
comin new to a place like thisbut she couldnt git up

The machinery inside the old horse showed signs of starting You
almost heard the wooden joints CREAK as he lurched forward like an old
proppedup humpy when the rotting props give way but at the sound of
Marys voice he settled back on his foundations again It must have been
a very poor selection that couldnt afford a better spare horse than
that

Reach me that lump er wood will yer missus said the boy and he
pointed to one of my spreads for the teamchains that lay inside the
fence Ill fling it back agin over the fence when I git this ole cow
started

But wait a minuteIve forgotten your mothers name said Mary

He grabbed at his thatch impatiently Me motherohthe old womans
names Mrs Spicer Git up karnt yer He twisted himself round and
brought the stretcher down on one of the horses points and he had
many with a crack that must have jarred his wrist

Do you go to school asked Mary There was a threedaysaweek school
over the ridges at Walls station

No he jerked out keeping his legs going Mewhy Im going on fur
fifteen The last teacher at Walls finished me Im going to Queensland
next month drovin Queensland border was over three hundred miles
away

Finished you How asked Mary

Me edgercation of course How do yer expect me to start this horse
when yer keep talkin

He split the spread over the horses point threw the pieces over the
fence and was off his elbows and legs flinging wildly and the old
sawstool lumbering along the road like an old working bullock trying a
canter That horse wasnt a trotter

And next month he DID start for Queensland He was a younger son and a
surplus boy on a wretched povertystricken selection and as there was
northin doin in the district his father in a burst of fatherly
kindness I suppose made him a present of the old horse and a new
pair of Blucher boots and I gave him an old saddle and a coat and he
started for the NeverNever Country

And Ill bet he got there But Im doubtful if the old horse did

Mary gave the boy five shillings and I dont think he had anything more
except a clean shirt and an extra pair of white cotton socks

Spicers farm was a big bark humpy on a patchy clearing in the native
appletree scrub The clearing was fenced in by a light doglegged
fence a fence of sapling poles resting on forks and Xshaped uprights
and the dusty ground round the house was almost entirely covered with
cattledung There was no attempt at cultivation when I came to live on
the creek but there were old furrowmarks amongst the stumps of another
shapeless patch in the scrub near the hut There was a wretched sapling
cowyard and calfpen and a cowbail with one sheet of bark over it for
shelter There was no dairy to be seen and I suppose the milk was set
in one of the two skillion rooms or leantos behind the hutthe
other was the boys bedroom The Spicers kept a few cows and steers
and had thirty or forty sheep Mrs Spicer used to drive down the creek
once aweek in her rickety old springcart to Cobborah with butter
and eggs The hut was nearly as bare inside as it was outjust a frame
of roundtimber sapling poles covered with bark The furniture was
permanent unless you rooted it up like in our kitchen a rough slab
table on stakes driven into the ground and seats made the same
way Mary told me afterwards that the beds in the bagandbark
partitionedoff room mothers bedroom were simply poles laid side
by side on crosspieces supported by stakes driven into the ground with
straw mattresses and some wornout bedclothes Mrs Spicer had an old
patchwork quilt in rags and the remains of a white one and Mary said
it was pitiful to see how these things would be spread over the bedsto
hide them as much as possiblewhen she went down there A packingcase
with something like an old print skirt draped round it and a cracked
lookingglass without a frame on top was the dressingtable
There were a couple of gincases for a wardrobe The boys beds were
threebushel bags stretched between poles fastened to uprights The
floor was the original surface tramped hard worn uneven with much
sweeping and with puddles in rainy weather where the roof leaked Mrs
Spicer used to stand old tins dishes and buckets under as many of
the leaks as she could The saucepans kettles and boilers were old
kerosenetins and billies They used kerosenetins too cut longways in
halves for setting the milk in The plates and cups were of tin
there were two or three cups without saucers and a crockery plate or
twoalso two mugs cracked and without handles one with For a Good
Boy and the other with For a Good Girl on it but all these were kept
on the mantelshelf for ornament and for company They were the only
ornaments in the house save a little wooden clock that hadnt gone for
years Mrs Spicer had a superstition that she had some things packed
away from the children

The pictures were cut from old copies of the Illustrated Sydney News
and pasted on to the bark I remember this because I remembered long
ago the Spencers who were our neighbours when I was a boy had the
walls of their bedroom covered with illustrations of the American Civil
War cut from illustrated London papers and I used to sneak into
mothers bedroom with Fred Spencer whenever we got the chance and
gloat over the prints I gave him a blade of a pocketknife once for
taking me in there

I saw very little of Spicer He was a big dark darkhaired and
whiskered man I had an idea that he wasnt a selector at all only a
dummy for the squatter of the Cobborah run You see selectors were
allowed to take up land on runs or pastoral leases The squatters
kept them off as much as possible by all manner of dodges and paltry
persecution The squatter would get as much freehold as he could afford
select as much land as the law allowed one man to take up and then
employ dummies dummy selectors to take up bits of land that he fancied
about his run and hold them for him

Spicer seemed gloomy and unsociable He was seldom at home He was
generally supposed to be away shearin or fencin or workin on
somebodys station It turned out that the last six months he was away
it was on the evidence of a cask of beef and a hide with the brand cut
out found in his camp on a fencing contract upcountry and which he
and his mates couldnt account for satisfactorily while the squatter
could Then the family lived mostly on bread and honey or bread and
treacle or bread and dripping and tea Every ounce of butter and every
egg was needed for the market to keep them in flour tea and sugar
Mary found that out but couldnt help them muchexcept by stuffing
the children with bread and meat or bread and jam whenever they came up
to our placefor Mrs Spicer was proud with the pride that lies down in
the end and turns its face to the wall and dies

Once when Mary asked Annie the eldest girl at home if she was
hungry she denied itbut she looked it A ragged mite she had with her
explained things The little fellow said

Mother told Annie not to say we was hungry if yer asked but if yer
give us anythink to eat we was to take it an say thenk yer Mrs
Wilson

I wouldnt a told yer a lie but I thought Jimmy would split on me
Mrs Wilson said Annie Thenk yer Mrs Wilson

She was not a big woman She was gaunt and flatchested and her face
was burnt to a brick as they say out there She had brown eyes
nearly red and a little wildlooking at times and a sharp faceground
sharp by hardshipthe cheeks drawn in She had an expression
likewell like a woman who had been very curious and suspicious at one
time and wanted to know everybodys business and hear everything and
had lost all her curiosity without losing the expression or the quick
suspicious movements of the head I dont suppose you understand I
cant explain it any other way She was not more than forty

I remember the first morning I saw her I was going up the creek to look
at the selection for the first time and called at the hut to see if she
had a bit of fresh mutton as I had none and was sick of corned beef

Yesofcourse she said in a sharp nasty tone as if to say Is
there anything more you want while the shops open Id met just the
same sort of woman years before while I was carrying swag between the
shearingsheds in the awful scrubs out west of the Darling river so I
didnt turn on my heels and walk away I waited for her to speak again

Comeinside she said and sit down I see youve got the waggon
outside I spose your names Wilson aint it Youre thinkin about
takin on Harry Marshfields selection up the creek so I heard Wait
till I fry you a chop and boil the billy

Her voice sounded more than anything else like a voice coming out of
a phonographI heard one in Sydney the other dayand not like a voice
coming out of her But sometimes when she got outside her everyday
life on this selection she spoke in a sort ofin a sort of lost
gropinginthedark kind of voice

She didnt talk much this timejust spoke in a mechanical way of the
drought and the hard times an butter n eggs bein down an her
husban an eldest son bein away an that makin it so hard for her

I dont know how many children she had I never got a chance to count
them for they were nearly all small and shy as piccaninnies and used
to run and hide when anybody came They were mostly nearly as black as
piccaninnies too She must have averaged a baby ayear for yearsand
God only knows how she got over her confinements Once they said she
only had a black gin with her She had an elder boy and girl but she
seldom spoke of them The girl Liza was in service in Sydney Im
afraid I knew what that meant The elder son was away He had been a
bit of a favourite round there it seemed

Some one might ask her Hows your son Jack Mrs Spicer or Heard of
Jack lately and where is he now

Oh hes somewheres up country shed say in the groping voice or
Hes drovin in Queenslan or Shearin on the Darlin the last time
I heerd from him We aint had a line from him sinceles seesince
Chrismas fore last

And shed turn her haggard eyes in a helpless hopeless sort of way
towards the westtowards upcountry and OutBack


  OutBack is always west of the Bushman no matter how
 far out he be


The eldest girl at home was nine or ten with a little old face and
lines across her forehead she had an older expression than her mother
Tommy went to Queensland as I told you The eldest son at home Bill
older than Tommy was a bit wild

Ive passed the place in smothering hot mornings in December when the
droppings about the cowyard had crumpled to dust that rose in the
warm sickly sunrise wind and seen that woman at work in the cowyard
bailing up and legroping cows milking or hauling at a rope round
the neck of a halfgrown calf that was too strong for her and she was
tough as fencingwire or humping great buckets of sour milk to the
pigs or the poddies handfed calves in the pen Id get off the
horse and give her a hand sometimes with a young steer or a cranky old
cow that wouldnt bailup and threatened her with her horns Shed
say

Thenk yer Mr Wilson Do yer think were ever goin to have any rain

Ive ridden past the place on bitter black rainy mornings in June or
July and seen her trudging about the yardthat was ankledeep in black
liquid filthwith an old pair of Blucher boots on and an old coat of
her husbands or maybe a threebushel bag over her shoulders Ive seen
her climbing on the roof by means of the watercask at the corner and
trying to stop a leak by shoving a piece of tin in under the bark And
when Id fixed the leak

Thenk yer Mr Wilson This drop of rains a blessin Come in and have
a dry at the fire and Ill make yer a cup of tea And if I was in a
hurry Come in man alive Come in and dry yerself a bit till the rain
holds up Yer cant go home like this Yerll git yer death o cold

Ive even seen her in the terrible drought climbing sheoaks and
appletrees by a makeshift ladder and awkwardly lopping off boughs to
feed the starving cattle

Jist tryin ter keep the milkers alive till the rain comes

They said that when the pleuropneumonia was in the district and amongst
her cattle she bled and physicked them herself and fed those that were
down with slices of halfripe pumpkins from a crop that had failed

An one day she told Mary there was a big barren heifer that we
called Queen Elizabeth that was down with the ploorer Shed been down
for four days and hadnt moved when one mornin I dumped some wheaten
chaffwe had a few bags that Spicer brought homeI dumped it in front
of her nose anwould yer blieve me Mrs Wilsonshe stumbled onter
her feet an chased me all the way to the house I had to pick up me
skirts an run Wasnt it rediclus

They had a sense of the ridiculous most of those poor sundried
Bushwomen I fancy that that helped save them from madness

We lost nearly all our milkers she told Mary I remember one day
Tommy came running to the house and screamed Marther mother theres
another milker down with the ploorer Jist as if it was great news
Well Mrs Wilson I was deadbeat an I giv in I jist sat down
to have a good cry and felt for my hankerchiefit WAS a rag of a
hankerchief full of holes all me others was in the wash Without
seein what I was doin I put me finger through one hole in the
hankerchief an me thumb through the other and poked me fingers into
me eyes instead of wipin them Then I had to laugh

Theres a story that once when the Bush or rather grass fires were
out all along the creek on Spicers side Walls station hands were up
above our place trying to keep the fire back from the boundary and
towards evening one of the men happened to think of the Spicers they
saw smoke down that way Spicer was away from home and they had a small
crop of wheat nearly ripe on the selection

My God that poor devil of a woman will be burnt out if she aint
already shouted young Billy Wall Come along three or four of you
chapsit was shearingtime and there were plenty of men on the
station

They raced down the creek to Spicers and were just in time to save the
wheat She had her sleeves tucked up and was beating out the burning
grass with a bough Shed been at it for an hour and was as black as a
gin they said She only said when theyd turned the fire Thenk yer
Wait an Ill make some tea

 

After tea the first Sunday she came to see us Mary asked

Dont you feel lonely Mrs Spicer when your husband goes away

Wellno Mrs Wilson she said in the groping sort of voice I uster
once I remember when we lived on the Cudgeegong riverwe lived in
a brick house thenthe first time Spicer had to go away from home I
nearly fretted my eyes out And he was only goin shearin for a month
I muster bin a fool but then we were only jist married a little while
Hes been away drovin in Queenslan as long as eighteen months at a
time since then But her voice seemed to grope in the dark more
than ever I dont mindI somehow seem to have got past carin
Besidesbesides Spicer was a very different man then to what he is
now Hes got so moody and gloomy at home he hardly ever speaks

Mary sat silent for a minute thinking Then Mrs Spicer roused herself

Oh I dont know what Im talkin about You mustnt take any notice of
me Mrs WilsonI dont often go on like this I do believe Im gittin
a bit ratty at times It must be the heat and the dulness

But once or twice afterwards she referred to a time when Spicer was a
different man to what he was now

I walked home with her a piece along the creek She said nothing for
a long time and seemed to be thinking in a puzzled way Then she said
suddenly

Whatdidyoubringherherefor Shes only a girl

I beg pardon Mrs Spicer

Oh I dont know what Im talkin about I blieve Im gittin ratty
You mustnt take any notice of me Mr Wilson

She wasnt much company for Mary and often when she had a child with
her shed start taking notice of the baby while Mary was talking which
used to exasperate Mary But poor Mrs Spicer couldnt help it and she
seemed to hear all the same

Her great trouble was that she couldnt git no reglar schoolin for
the children

I learns em at home as much as I can But I dont git a minute to
call me own an Im ginerally that deadbeat at night that Im fit for
nothink

Mary had some of the children up now and then later on and taught them
a little When she first offered to do so Mrs Spicer laid hold of the
handiest youngster and said

Theredo you hear that Mrs Wilson is goin to teach yer an
its more than yer deserve the youngster had been cryin over
something Now go up an say Thenk yer Mrs Wilson And if yer
aint good and dont do as she tells yer Ill break every bone in yer
young body

The poor little devil stammered something and escaped

The children were sent by turns over to Walls to Sundayschool When
Tommy was at home he had a new pair of elasticside boots and there was
no end of rows about them in the familyfor the mother made him lend
them to his sister Annie to go to Sundayschool in in her turn There
were only about three pairs of anyway decent boots in the family and
these were saved for great occasions The children were always as clean
and tidy as possible when they came to our place

And I think the saddest and most pathetic sight on the face of Gods
earth is the children of very poor people made to appear well the
broken wornout boots polished or greased the blackened inked pieces
of string for laces the clean patched pinafores over the wretched
threadbare frocks Behind the little row of children handinhandand
no matter where they areI always see the worn face of the mother

Towards the end of the first year on the selection our little girl came
Id sent Mary to Gulgong for four months that time and when she came
back with the baby Mrs Spicer used to come up pretty often She came up
several times when Mary was ill to lend a hand She wouldnt sit down
and condole with Mary or waste her time asking questions or talking
about the time when she was ill herself Shed take off her hata
shapeless little lump of black straw she wore for visitinggive
her hair a quick brush back with the palms of her hands roll up her
sleeves and set to work to tidy up She seemed to take most pleasure
in sorting out our childrens clothes and dressing them Perhaps she
used to dress her own like that in the days when Spicer was a different
man from what he was now She seemed interested in the fashionplates
of some womens journals we had and used to study them with an interest
that puzzled me for she was not likely to go in for fashion She never
talked of her early girlhood but Mary from some things she noticed
was inclined to think that Mrs Spicer had been fairly well brought up
For instance Dr Balanfantie from Cudgeegong came out to see Walls
wife and drove up the creek to our place on his way back to see how
Mary and the baby were getting on Mary got out some crockery and some
tablenapkins that she had packed away for occasions like this and
she said that the way Mrs Spicer handled the things and helped set the
table though she did it in a mechanical sort of way convinced her
that she had been used to tablenapkins at one time in her life

Sometimes after a long pause in the conversation Mrs Spicer would say
suddenly

Oh I dont think Ill come up next week Mrs Wilson

Why Mrs Spicer

Because the visits doesnt do me any good I git the dismals
afterwards

Why Mrs Spicer What on earth do you mean

OhIdontknowwhatImtalkinabout You mustnt take any notice
of me And shed put on her hat kiss the childrenand Mary too
sometimes as if she mistook her for a childand go

Mary thought her a little mad at times But I seemed to understand

Once when Mrs Spicer was sick Mary went down to her and down again
next day As she was coming away the second time Mrs Spicer said

I wish you wouldnt come down any more till Im on me feet Mrs Wilson
The children can do for me

Why Mrs Spicer

Well the place is in such a muck and it hurts me

We were the aristocrats of Laheys Creek Whenever we drove down on
Sunday afternoon to see Mrs Spicer and as soon as we got near enough
for them to hear the rattle of the cart wed see the children running
to the house as fast as they could split and hear them screaming

Oh marther Here comes Mr and Mrs Wilson in their springcart

And wed see her bustle round and two or three fowls fly out the
front door and shed lay hold of a broom made of a bound bunch of
broomstuffcoarse reedy grass or bush from the ridgeswith a stick
stuck in it and flick out the floor with a flick or two round in front
of the door perhaps The floor nearly always needed at least one flick
of the broom on account of the fowls Or shed catch a youngster and
scrub his face with a wet end of a cloudy towel or twist the towel
round her finger and dig out his earsas if she was anxious to have him
hear every word that was going to be said

No matter what state the house would be in shed always say I was jist
expectin yer Mrs Wilson And she was original in that anyway

She had an old patched and darned white tablecloth that she used to
spread on the table when we were there as a matter of course The
others is in the wash so you must excuse this Mrs Wilson but I saw
by the eyes of the children that the cloth was rather a wonderful thing
to them I must really git some more knives an forks next time Im in
Cobborah shed say The children break an lose em till Im ashamed
to ask Christians ter sit down ter the table

She had many Bush yarns some of them very funny some of them rather
ghastly but all interesting and with a grim sort of humour about them
But the effect was often spoilt by her screaming at the children to
Drive out them fowls karnt yer or Take yer maulies hands outer
the sugar or Dont touch Mrs Wilsons baby with them dirty maulies
or Dont stand starin at Mrs Wilson with yer mouth an ears in that
vulgar way

Poor woman she seemed everlastingly nagging at the children It was
a habit but they didnt seem to mind Most Bushwomen get the nagging
habit I remember one who had the prettiest dearest sweetest most
willing and affectionate little girl I think I ever saw and she nagged
that child from daylight till darkand after it Taking it all round
I think that the nagging habit in a mother is often worse on ordinary
children and more deadly on sensitive youngsters than the drinking
habit in a father

One of the yarns Mrs Spicer told us was about a squatter she knew who
used to go wrong in his head every now and again and try to commit
suicide Once when the stationhand who was watching him had his eye
off him for a minute he hanged himself to a beam in the stable The
men ran in and found him hanging and kicking They let him hang for
a while said Mrs Spicer till he went black in the face and stopped
kicking Then they cut him down and threw a bucket of water over him

Why what on earth did they let the man hang for asked Mary

To give him a good bellyful of it they thought it would cure him of
tryin to hang himself again

Well thats the coolest thing I ever heard of said Mary

Thats jist what the magistrate said Mrs Wilson said Mrs Spicer

One morning said Mrs Spicer Spicer had gone off on his horse
somewhere and I was alone with the children when a man came to the
door and said

For Gods sake woman give me a drink

Lord only knows where he came from He was dressed like a new chumhis
clothes was good but he looked as if hed been sleepin in them in the
Bush for a month He was very shaky I had some coffee that mornin
so I gave him some in a pint pot he drank it and then he stood on his
head till he tumbled over and then he stood up on his feet and said
Thenk yer mum

I was so surprised that I didnt know what to say so I jist said
Would you like some more coffee

Yes thenk yer he saidabout two quarts

I nearly filled the pint pot and he drank it and stood on his head
as long as he could and when he got right end up he said Thenk yer
mumits a fine day and then he walked off He had two saddlestraps
in his hands

Why what did he stand on his head for asked Mary

To wash it up and down I suppose to get twice as much taste of the
coffee He had no hat I sent Tommy across to Walls to tell them that
there was a man wanderin about the Bush in the horrors of drink and
to get some one to ride for the police But they was too late for he
hanged himself that night

O Lord cried Mary

Yes right close to here jist down the creek where the track to Walls
branches off Tommy found him while he was out after the cows Hangin
to the branch of a tree with the two saddlestraps

Mary stared at her speechless

Tommy came home yellin with fright I sent him over to Walls at once
After breakfast the minute my eyes was off them the children slipped
away and went down there They came back screamin at the tops of their
voices I did give it to them I reckon they wont want ter see a dead
body again in a hurry Every time Id mention it theyd huddle together
or ketch hold of me skirts and howl

Yerll go agen when I tell yer not to Id say

Oh no mother theyd howl

Yer wanted ter see a man hangin I said

Oh dont mother Dont talk about it

Yer wouldnt be satisfied till yer see it Id say yer had to see
it or burst Yer satisfied now aint yer

Oh dont mother

Yer run all the way there I spose

Dont mother

But yer run faster back didnt yer

Oh dont mother

But said Mrs Spicer in conclusion Id been down to see it myself
before they was up

And aint you afraid to live alone here after all these horrible
things asked Mary

Well no I dont mind I seem to have got past carin for anythink
now I felt it a little when Tommy went awaythe first time I felt
anythink for years But Im over that now

Havent you got any friends in the district Mrs Spicer

Oh yes Theres me married sister near Cobborah and a married brother
near Dubbo hes got a station They wanted to take me an the children
between them or take some of the younger children But I couldnt bring
my mind to break up the home I want to keep the children together as
much as possible Theres enough of them gone God knows But its a
comfort to know that theres some one to see to them if anythink happens
to me

 

One dayI was on my way home with the team that dayAnnie Spicer came
running up the creek in terrible trouble

Oh Mrs Wilson something terribls happened at home A trooper
mounted policemanthey called them mounted troopers out there a
troopers come and took Billy Billy was the eldest son at home

What

Its true Mrs Wilson

What for What did the policeman say

Hehehe said IIm very sorry Mrs Spicer butII want
William

It turned out that William was wanted on account of a horse missed from
Walls station and sold downcountry

An mother took on awful sobbed Annie an now shell only sit
stockstill an stare in front of her and wont take no notice of any
of us Oh its awful Mrs Wilson The policeman said hed tell Aunt
Emma Mrs Spicers sister at Cobborah and send her out But I had to
come to you an Ive run all the way

James put the horse to the cart and drove Mary down

Mary told me all about it when I came home

I found her just as Annie said but she broke down and cried in my
arms Oh Joe it was awful She didnt cry like a woman I heard a man
at Haviland cry at his brothers funeral and it was just like that She
came round a bit after a while Her sisters with her now Oh Joe
you must take me away from the Bush

Later on Mary said

How the oaks are sighing tonight Joe

 

Next morning I rode across to Walls station and tackled the old man
but he was a hard man and wouldnt listen to mein fact he ordered
me off the station I was a selector and that was enough for him But
young Billy Wall rode after me

Look here Joe he said its a blanky shame All for the sake of a
horse And as if that poor devil of a woman hasnt got enough to put up
with already I wouldnt do it for twenty horses ILL tackle the boss
and if he wont listen to me Ill walk off the run for the last time
if I have to carry my swag

Billy Wall managed it The charge was withdrawn and we got young Billy
Spicer off upcountry

But poor Mrs Spicer was never the same after that She seldom came up to
our place unless Mary dragged her so to speak and then she would talk
of nothing but her last trouble till her visits were painful to look
forward to

If it only could have been kep quietfor the sake of the other
children they are all I think of now I tried to bring em all up
decent but I spose it was my fault somehow Its the disgrace thats
killin meI cant bear it

I was at home one Sunday with Mary and a jolly Bushgirl named Maggie
Charlsworth who rode over sometimes from Walls station I must tell
you about her some other time James was shook after her and we got
talkin about Mrs Spicer Maggie was very warm about old Wall

I expected Mrs Spicer up today said Mary She seems better lately

Why cried Maggie Charlsworth if that aint Annie coming running up
along the creek Somethings the matter

We all jumped up and ran out

What is it Annie cried Mary

Oh Mrs Wilson Mothers asleep and we cant wake her

What

Itsits the truth Mrs Wilson

How long has she been asleep

Since lars night

My God cried Mary SINCE LAST NIGHT

No Mrs Wilson not all the time she woke wonst about daylight this
mornin She called me and said she didnt feel well and Id have to
manage the milkin

Was that all she said

No She said not to go for you and she said to feed the pigs and
calves and she said to be sure and water them geraniums

Mary wanted to go but I wouldnt let her James and I saddled our
horses and rode down the creek

 

Mrs Spicer looked very little different from what she did when I last
saw her alive It was some time before we could believe that she was
dead But she was past carin right enough




A Double Buggy at Laheys Creek




I Spuds and a Womans Obstinacy


Ever since we were married it had been Marys great ambition to have a
buggy The house or furniture didnt matter so muchout there in the
Bush where we werebut where there were no railways or coaches and
the roads were long and mostly hot and dusty a buggy was the great
thing I had a few pounds when we were married and was going to get
one then but new buggies went high and another party got hold of a
secondhand one that Id had my eye on so Mary thought it over and at
last she said Never mind the buggy Joe get a sewingmachine and Ill
be satisfied Ill want the machine more than the buggy for a while
Wait till were better off

After that whenever I took a contractto put up a fence or woolshed
or sink a dam or somethingMary would say You ought to knock a buggy
out of this job Joe but something always turned upbad weather or
sickness Once I cut my foot with the adze and was laid up and another
time a dam I was making was washed away by a flood before I finished
it Then Mary would say Ah wellnever mind Joe Wait till we are
better off But she felt it hard the time I built a woolshed and
didnt get paid for it for wed as good as settled about another
secondhand buggy then

I always had a fancy for carpentering and was handy with tools I made
a springcartbody and wheelsin spare time out of colonial hardwood
and got Little the blacksmith to do the ironwork I painted the cart
myself It wasnt much lighter than one of the tipdrays I had but it
WAS a springcart and Mary pretended to be satisfied with it anyway I
didnt hear any more of the buggy for a while

I sold that cart for fourteen pounds to a Chinese gardener who wanted
a strong cart to carry his vegetables round through the Bush It was
just before our first youngster came I told Mary that I wanted the
money in case of extra expenseand she didnt fret much at losing
that cart But the fact was that I was going to make another try for
a buggy as a present for Mary when the child was born I thought of
getting the turnout while she was laid up keeping it dark from her
till she was on her feet again and then showing her the buggy standing
in the shed But she had a bad time and I had to have the doctor
regularly and get a proper nurse and a lot of things extra so the
buggy idea was knocked on the head I was set on it too Id thought of
how when Mary was up and getting strong Id say one morning Go round
and have a look in the shed Mary Ive got a few fowls for you or
something like thatand follow her round to watch her eyes when she saw
the buggy I never told Mary about thatit wouldnt have done any good

Later on I got some good timbermostly scraps that were given to
meand made a light body for a springcart Galletly the coachbuilder
at Cudgeegong had got a dozen pairs of American hickory wheels up from
Sydney for light springcarts and he let me have a pair for cost price
and carriage I got him to iron the cart and he put it through
the paintshop for nothing He sent it out too at the tail of Tom
Tarrants big vanto increase the surprise We were swells then for
a while I heard no more of a buggy until after wed been settled at
Laheys Creek for a couple of years

I told you how I went into the carrying line and took up a selection at
Laheys Creekfor a run for the horses and to grow a bit of feedand
shifted Mary and little Jim out there from Gulgong with Marys young
scamp of a brother James to keep them company while I was on the road
The first year I did well enough carrying but I never cared for itit
was too slow and besides I was always anxious when I was away from
home The game was right enough for a single manor a married one whose
wife had got the nagging habit as many Bushwomen haveGod help em
and who wanted peace and quietness sometimes Besides other small
carriers started seeing me getting on and Tom Tarrant the
coachdriver at Cudgeegong had another heavy springvan built and put
it on the roads and he took a lot of the light stuff

The second year I made a riseout of spuds of all the things in the
world It was Marys idea Down at the lower end of our selectionMary
called it the runwas a shallow watercourse called Snakes Creek dry
most of the year except for a muddy waterhole or two and just above
the junction where it ran into Laheys Creek was a low piece of good
blacksoil flat on our sideabout three acres The flat was fairly
clear when I came to the selectionsave for a few logs that had been
washed up there in some big old man flood way back in blackfellows
times and one day when I had a spell at home I got the horses and
tracechains and dragged the logs togetherthose that wouldnt split
for fencing timberand burnt them off I had a notion to get the flat
ploughed and make a lucernpaddock of it There was a good waterhole
under a clump of sheoak in the bend and Mary used to take her stools
and tubs and boiler down there in the springcart in hot weather and
wash the clothes under the shade of the treesit was cooler and
saved carrying water to the house And one evening after shed done the
washing she said to me

Look here Joe the farmers out here never seem to get a new idea they
dont seem to me ever to try and find out beforehand what the market is
going to be likethey just go on farming the same old way and putting
in the same old crops year after year They sow wheat and if it comes
on anything like the thing they reap and thresh it if it doesnt
they mow it for hayand some of em dont have the brains to do that in
time Now I was looking at that bit of flat you cleared and it struck
me that it wouldnt be a half bad idea to get a bag of seedpotatoes
and have the land ploughedold Corny George would do it cheapand
get them put in at once Potatoes have been dear all round for the last
couple of years

I told her she was talking nonsense that the ground was no good for
potatoes and the whole district was too dry Everybody I know has
tried it one time or another and made nothing of it I said

All the more reason why you should try it Joe said Mary Just try
one crop It might rain for weeks and then youll be sorry you didnt
take my advice

But I tell you the ground is not potatoground I said

How do you know You havent sown any there yet

But Ive turned up the surface and looked at it Its not rich enough
and too dry I tell you You need swampy boggy ground for potatoes Do
you think I dont know land when I see it

But you havent TRIED to grow potatoes there yet Joe How do you
know

I didnt listen to any more Mary was obstinate when she got an idea
into her head It was no use arguing with her All the time Id be
talking shed just knit her forehead and go on thinking straight ahead
on the track shed startedjust as if I wasnt thereand it used to
make me mad Shed keep driving at me till I took her advice or lost my
temperI did both at the same time mostly

I took my pipe and went out to smoke and cool down

A couple of days after the potato breeze I started with the team down
to Cudgeegong for a load of fencingwire I had to bring out and after
Id kissed Mary goodbye she said

Look here Joe if you bring out a bag of seedpotatoes James and I
will slice them and old Corny George down the creek would bring his
plough up in the dray and plough the ground for very little We could
put the potatoes in ourselves if the ground were only ploughed

I thought shed forgotten all about it There was no time to argueId
be sure to lose my temper and then Id either have to waste an hour
comforting Mary or go off in a huff as the women call it and be
miserable for the trip So I said Id see about it She gave me another
hug and a kiss Dont forget Joe she said as I started Think it
over on the road I reckon she had the best of it that time

About five miles along just as I turned into the main road I heard
some one galloping after me and I saw young James on his hack I got a
start for I thought that something had gone wrong at home I remember
the first day I left Mary on the creek for the first five or six miles
I was halfadozen times on the point of turning backonly I thought
shed laugh at me

What is it James I shouted before he came upbut I saw he was
grinning

Mary says to tell you not to forget to bring a hoe out with you

You clear off home I said or Ill lay the whip about your young
hide and dont come riding after me again as if the run was on fire

Well you neednt get shirty with me he said I dont want to have
anything to do with a hoe And he rode off

I DID get thinking about those potatoes though I hadnt meant to I
knew of an independent man in that district whod made his money out
of a crop of potatoes but that was away back in the roaring
Fifties54when spuds went up to twentyeight shillings a
hundredweight in Sydney on account of the gold rush We might get
good rain now and anyway it wouldnt cost much to put the potatoes
in If they came on well it would be a few pounds in my pocket if the
crop was a failure Id have a better show with Mary next time she was
struck by an idea outside housekeeping and have something to grumble
about when I felt grumpy

I got a couple of bags of potatoeswe could use those that were
left over and I got a small iron plough and a harrow that Little the
blacksmith had lying in his yard and let me have cheaponly about
a pound more than I told Mary I gave for them When I took advice I
generally made the mistake of taking more than was offered or adding
notions of my own It was vanity I suppose If the crop came on well I
could claim the ploughandharrow part of the idea anyway It didnt
strike me that if the crop failed Mary would have the plough and harrow
against me for old Corny would plough the ground for ten or fifteen
shillings Anyway Id want a plough and harrow later on and I might
as well get it now it would give James something to do

I came out by the western road by Guntawang and up the creek home and
the first thing I saw was old Corny George ploughing the flat And
Mary was down on the bank superintending Shed got James with the
tracechains and the spare horses and had made him clear off every
stick and bush where another furrow might be squeezed in Old Corny
looked pretty grumpy on ithed broken all his ploughshares but one in
the roots and James didnt look much brighter Mary had an old felt
hat and a new pair of lasticside boots of mine on and the boots were
covered with clay for shed been down hustling James to get a rotten
old stump out of the way by the time Corny came round with his next
furrow

I thought Id make the boots easy for you Joe said Mary

Its all right Mary I said Im not going to growl Those boots
were a bone of contention between us but she generally got them off
before I got home

Her face fell a little when she saw the plough and harrow in the waggon
but I said that would be all rightwed want a plough anyway

I thought you wanted old Corny to plough the ground she said

I never said so

But when I sent Jim after you about the hoe to put the spuds in you
didnt say you wouldnt bring it she said

I had a few days at home and entered into the spirit of the thing When
Corny was done James and I crossploughed the land and got a stump or
two a big log and some scrub out of the way at the upper end and added
nearly an acre and ploughed that James was all right at most Bushwork
hed bullock so long as the novelty lasted he liked ploughing or
fencing or any graft he could make a show at He didnt care for
grubbing out stumps or splitting posts and rails We sliced the
potatoes of an eveningand there was trouble between Mary and James
over cutting through the eyes There was no time for the hoeand
besides it wasnt a novelty to Jamesso I just ran furrows and they
dropped the spuds in behind me and I turned another furrow over them
and ran the harrow over the ground I think I hilled those spuds too
with furrowsor a crop of Indian corn I put in later on

It rained heavenshard for over a week we had regular showers all
through and it was the finest crop of potatoes ever seen in the
district I believe at first Mary used to slip down at daybreak to see
if the potatoes were up and shed write to me about them on the road
I forget how many bags I got but the few who had grown potatoes in the
district sent theirs to Sydney and spuds went up to twelve and fifteen
shillings a hundredweight in that district I made a few quid out of
mineand saved carriage too for I could take them out on the waggon
Then Mary began to hear through James of a buggy that some one had for
sale cheap or a dogcart that somebody else wanted to get rid ofand
let me know about it in an offhand way




II Joe Wilsons Luck


There was good grass on the selection all the year Id picked up
a small lotabout twenty headof halfstarved steers for next to
nothing and turned them on the run they came on wonderfully and my
brotherinlaw Marys sisters husband who was running a butchery
at Gulgong gave me a good price for them His carts ran out twenty or
thirty miles to little bits of goldrushes that were going on at th
Home Rule Happy Valley Guntawang Tallawang and Cooyal and those
places round there and he was doing well

Mary had heard of a light American waggonette when the steers wenta
traybody arrangement and she thought shed do with that It would
be better than the buggy Joe she saidthered be more room for
the children and besides I could take butter and eggs to Gulgong
or Cobborah when we get a few more cows Then James heard of a small
flock of sheep that a selectorwho was about starved off his selection
out Talbragar waywanted to get rid of James reckoned he could get
them for less than halfacrown ahead Wed had a heavy shower of rain
that came over the ranges and didnt seem to go beyond our boundaries
Mary said Its a pity to see all that grass going to waste Joe
Better get those sheep and try your luck with them Leave some money
with me and Ill send James over for them Never mind about the
buggywell get that when were on our feet

So James rode across to Talbragar and drove a hard bargain with that
unfortunate selector and brought the sheep home There were about two
hundred wethers and ewes and they were young and looked a good breed
too but so poor they could scarcely travel they soon picked up
though The drought was blazing all round and OutBack and I think that
my corner of the ridges was the only place where there was any grass to
speak of We had another shower or two and the grass held out Chaps
began to talk of Joe Wilsons luck

I would have liked to shear those sheep but I hadnt time to get a shed
or anything readyalong towards Christmas there was a bit of a boom
in the carrying line Wethers in wool were going as high as thirteen
to fifteen shillings at the Homebush yards at Sydney so I arranged to
truck the sheep down from the river by rail with another small lot that
was going and I started James off with them He took the west road and
down Guntawang way a big farmer who saw James with the sheep and who
was speculating or adding to his stock or took a fancy to the wool
offered James as much for them as he reckoned Id get in Sydney after
paying the carriage and the agents and the auctioneer James put the
sheep in a paddock and rode back to me He was all there where riding
was concerned I told him to let the sheep go James made a Greener
shotgun and got his saddle done up out of that job

I took up a couple more fortyacre blocksone in Jamess name to
encourage him with the fencing There was a good slice of land in an
angle between the range and the creek farther down which everybody
thought belonged to Wall the squatter but Mary got an idea and went
to the local land office and found out that it was unoccupied Crown
land and so I took it up on pastoral lease and got a few more
sheepId saved some of the bestlooking ewes from the last lot

One eveningI was going down next day for a load of fencingwire for
myselfMary said

Joe do you know that the Matthews have got a new double buggy

The Matthews were a big family of cockatoos along up the main road and
I didnt think much of them The sons were all badeggs though the
old woman and girls were right enough

Well what of that I said Theyre up to their neck in debt and
camping like blackfellows in a big bark humpy They do well to go
flashing round in a double buggy

But that isnt what I was going to say said Mary They want to sell
their old single buggy James says Im sure you could get it for six or
seven pounds and you could have it done up

I wish James to the devil I said Cant he find anything better to
do than ride round after cockandbull yarns about buggies

Well said Mary it was James who got the steers and the sheep

Well one word led to another and we said things we didnt meanbut
couldnt forget in a hurry I remember I said something about Mary
always dragging me back just when I was getting my head above water and
struggling to make a home for her and the children and that hurt her
and she spoke of the homes shed had since she was married And that
cut me deep

It was about the worst quarrel we had When she began to cry I got my
hat and went out and walked up and down by the creek I hated anything
that looked like injusticeI was so sensitive about it that it made
me unjust sometimes I tried to think I was right but I couldntit
wouldnt have made me feel any better if I could have thought so I got
thinking of Marys first year on the selection and the life shed had
since we were married

When I went in shed cried herself to sleep I bent over and Mary I
whispered

She seemed to wake up

JoeJoe she said

What is it Mary I said

Im pretty well sure that old Spots calf isnt in the pen Make James
go at once

Old Spots last calf was two years old now so Mary was talking in her
sleep and dreaming she was back in her first year

We both laughed when I told her about it afterwards but I didnt feel
like laughing just then

Later on in the night she called out in her sleep

JoeJoe Put that buggy in the shed or the sun will blister the
varnish

I wish I could say that that was the last time I ever spoke unkindly to
Mary

Next morning I got up early and fried the bacon and made the tea and
took Marys breakfast in to herlike I used to do sometimes when we
were first married She didnt say anythingjust pulled my head down
and kissed me

When I was ready to start Mary said

Youd better take the springcart in behind the dray and get the tyres
cut and set Theyre ready to drop off and James has been wedging them
up till hes tired of it The last time I was out with the children
I had to knock one of them back with a stone therell be an accident
yet

So I lashed the shafts of the cart under the tail of the waggon and
mean and ridiculous enough the cart looked going along that way It
suggested a man stooping along handcuffed with his arms held out and
down in front of him

It was dull weather and the scrubs looked extra dreary and endlessand
I got thinking of old things Everything was going all right with me
but that didnt keep me from brooding sometimestrying to hatch out
stones like an old hen we had at home I think taking it all round I
used to be happier when I was mostly hardupand more generous When I
had ten pounds I was more likely to listen to a chap who said Lend me
a poundnote Joe than when I had fifty THEN I fought shy of careless
chapsand lost mates that I wanted afterwardsand got the name of
being mean When I got a good cheque Id be as miserable as a miser over
the first ten pounds I spent but when I got down to the last Id buy
things for the house And now that I was getting on I hated to spend
a pound on anything But then the farther I got away from poverty the
greater the fear I had of itand besides there was always before us
all the thought of the terrible drought with blazing runs as bare and
dusty as the road and dead stock rotting every yard all along the
barren creeks

I had a long yarn with Marys sister and her husband that night in
Gulgong and it brightened me up I had a fancy that that sort of a
brotherinlaw made a better mate than a nearer one Tom Tarrant had
one and he said it was sympathy But while we were yarning I couldnt
help thinking of Mary out there in the hut on the Creek with no one to
talk to but the children or James who was sulky at home or Black
Mary or Black Jimmy our black boys father and mother who werent
oversentimental Or maybe a selectors wife the nearest was five
miles away who could talk only of two or three thingslambin and
shearin and cookin for the men and what she said to her old man
and what he said to herand her own ailmentsover and over again

Its a wonder it didnt drive Mary madI know I could never listen to
that woman more than an hour Marys sister said

Now if Mary had a comfortable buggy she could drive in with the
children oftener Then she wouldnt feel the loneliness so much

I said Good night then and turned in There was no getting away from
that buggy Whenever Marys sister started hinting about a buggy I
reckoned it was a putup job between them




III The Ghost of Marys Sacrifice


When I got to Gudgeegong I stopped at Galletlys coachshop to leave the
cart The Galletlys were good fellows there were two brothersone was
a saddler and harnessmaker Big brownbearded menthe biggest men in
the district twas said

Their old man had died lately and left them some money they had men
and only worked in their shops when they felt inclined or there was a
special work to do they were both firstclass tradesmen I went into
the painters shop to have a look at a double buggy that Galletly had
built for a man who couldnt pay cash for it when it was finishedand
Galletly wouldnt trust him

There it stood behind a calico screen that the coachpainters used to
keep out the dust when they were varnishing It was a firstclass piece
of workpole shafts cushions whip lamps and all complete If you
only wanted to drive one horse you could take out the pole and put in
the shafts and there you were There was a tilt over the front seat
if you only wanted the buggy to carry two you could fold down the back
seat and there you had a handsome roomy single buggy It would go
near fifty pounds

While I was looking at it Bill Galletly came in and slapped me on the
back

Now theres a chance for you Joe he said I saw you rubbing your
head round that buggy the last time you were in You wouldnt get a
better one in the colonies and you wont see another like it in the
district again in a hurryfor it doesnt pay to build em Now youre a
fullblown squatter and its time you took little Mary for a fly round
in her own buggy now and then instead of having her stuck out there in
the scrub or jolting through the dust in a cart like some old Mother
Flourbag

He called her little Mary because the Galletly family had known her
when she was a girl

I rubbed my head and looked at the buggy again It was a great
temptation

Look here Joe said Bill Galletly in a quieter tone Ill tell you
what Ill do Ill let YOU have the buggy You can take it out and send
along a bit of a cheque when you feel you can manage it and the rest
later ona year will do or even two years Youve had a hard pull
and Im not likely to be hard up for money in a hurry

They were good fellows the Galletlys but they knew their men I
happened to know that Bill Galletly wouldnt let the man he built the
buggy for take it out of the shop without cash down though he was a
bigbug round there But that didnt make it easier for me

Just then Robert Galletly came into the shop He was rather quieter than
his brother but the two were very much alike

Look here Bob said Bill heres a chance for you to get rid of your
harness Joe Wilsons going to take that buggy off my hands

Bob Galletly put his foot up on a sawstool took one hand out of his
pockets rested his elbow on his knee and his chin on the palm of his
hand and bunched up his big beard with his fingers as he always did
when he was thinking Presently he took his foot down put his hand
back in his pocket and said to me Well Joe Ive got a double set of
harness made for the man who ordered that damned buggy and if you like
Ill let you have it I suppose when Bill there has squeezed all he
can out of you Ill stand a show of getting something Hes a regular
Shylock he is

I pushed my hat forward and rubbed the back of my head and stared at the
buggy

Come across to the Royal Joe said Bob

But I knew that a beer would settle the business so I said Id get the
wool up to the station first and think it over and have a drink when I
came back

I thought it over on the way to the station but it didnt seem good
enough I wanted to get some more sheep and there was the new run to
be fenced in and the instalments on the selections I wanted lots of
things that I couldnt well do without Then again the farther I got
away from debt and hardupedness the greater the horror I had of it I
had two horses that would do but Id have to get another later on and
altogether the buggy would run me nearer a hundred than fifty pounds
Supposing a dry season threw me back with that buggy on my hands
Besides I wanted a spell If I got the buggy it would only mean an
extra turn of hard graft for me No Id take Mary for a trip to Sydney
and shed have to be satisfied with that

Id got it settled and was just turning in through the big white
gates to the goodsshed when young Black the squatter dashed past the
station in his big new waggonette with his wife and a driver and a lot
of portmanteaus and rugs and things They were going to do the grand
in Sydney over Christmas Now it was young Black who was so shook after
Mary when she was in service with the Blacks before the old man died
and if I hadnt come alongand if girls never cared for vagabondsMary
would have been mistress of Haviland homestead with servants to wait on
her and she was far better fitted for it than the one that was there
She would have been going to Sydney every holiday and putting up at the
old Royal with every comfort that a woman could ask for and seeing
a play every night And Id have been knocking around amongst the big
stations OutBack or maybe drinking myself to death at the shanties

The Blacks didnt see me as I went by ragged and dusty and with an
old nearly black cabbagetree hat drawn over my eyes I didnt care
a damn for them or any one else at most times but I had moods when I
felt things

One of Blacks big wool teams was just coming away from the shed and
the driver a big dark rough fellow with some foreign blood in him
didnt seem inclined to wheel his team an inch out of the middle of the
road I stopped my horses and waited He looked at me and I looked at
himhard Then he wheeled off scowling and swearing at his horses
Id given him a hiding six or seven years before and he hadnt
forgotten it And I felt then as if I wouldnt mind trying to give some
one a hiding

The goods clerk must have thought that Joe Wilson was pretty grumpy that
day I was thinking of Mary out there in the lonely hut on a barren
creek in the Bushfor it was little betterwith no one to speak to
except a haggard wornout Bushwoman or two that came to see her
on Sunday I thought of the hardships she went through in the first
yearthat I havent told you about yet of the time she was ill and I
away and no one to understand of the time she was alone with James and
Jim sick and of the loneliness she fought through out there I thought
of Mary outside in the blazing heat with an old print dress and a
felt hat and a pair of lasticsiders of mine on doing the work of
a station manager as well as that of a housewife and mother And her
cheeks were getting thin and her colour was going I thought of the
gaunt brickbrown sawfile voiced hopeless and spiritless Bushwomen I
knewand some of them not much older than Mary

When I went back down into the town I had a drink with Bill Galletly at
the Royal and that settled the buggy then Bob shouted and I took the
harness Then I shouted to wet the bargain When I was going Bob said
Send in that young scamp of a brother of Marys with the horses if
the collars dont fit Ill fix up a pair of makeshifts and alter the
others I thought they both gripped my hand harder than usual but that
might have been the beer

  Shout to buy a round of drinksA L 1997




IV The Buggy Comes Home


I whipped the cat a bit the first twenty miles or so but then I
thought what did it matter What was the use of grinding to save money
until we were too old to enjoy it If we had to go down in the world
again we might as well fall out of a buggy as out of a draythered be
some talk about it anyway and perhaps a little sympathy When Mary had
the buggy she wouldnt be tied down so much to that wretched hole in the
Bush and the Sydney trips neednt be off either I could drive down to
Wallerawang on the main line where Mary had some people and leave the
buggy and horses there and take the train to Sydney or go right on by
the old coachroad over the Blue Mountains it would be a grand drive
I thought best to tell Marys sister at Gulgong about the buggy I told
her Id keep it dark from Mary till the buggy came home She entered
into the spirit of the thing and said shed give the world to be able
to go out with the buggy if only to see Mary open her eyes when she saw
it but she couldnt go on account of a new baby she had I was rather
glad she couldnt for it would spoil the surprise a little I thought
I wanted that all to myself

I got home about sunset next day and after tea when Id finished
telling Mary all the news and a few lies as to why I didnt bring the
cart back and one or two other things I sat with James out on a log
of the woodheap where we generally had our smokes and interviews and
told him all about the buggy He whistled then he said

But what do you want to make it such a Bushranging business for
Why cant you tell Mary now It will cheer her up Shes been pretty
miserable since youve been away this trip

I want it to be a surprise I said

Well Ive got nothing to say against a surprise out in a hole like
this but it ud take a lot to surprise me What am I to say to Mary
about taking the two horses in Ill only want one to bring the cart
out and shes sure to ask

Tell her youre going to get yours shod

But he had a set of slippers only the other day She knows as much
about horses as we do I dont mind telling a lie so long as a chap has
only got to tell a straight lie and be done with it But Mary asks so
many questions

Well drive the other horse up the creek early and pick him up as you
go

Yes And shell want to know what I want with two bridles But Ill fix
herYOU neednt worry

And James I said get a chamois leather and spongewell want em
anywayand you might give the buggy a wash down in the creek coming
home Its sure to be covered with dust

Ohorlright

And if you can time yourself to get here in the cool of the evening
or just about sunset

What for

Id thought it would be better to have the buggy there in the cool
of the evening when Mary would have time to get excited and get over
itbetter than in the blazing hot morning when the sun rose as hot as
at noon and wed have the long broiling day before us

What do you want me to come at sunset for asked James Do you want
me to camp out in the scrub and turn up like a blooming sundowner

Oh well I said get here at midnight if you like

We didnt say anything for a whilejust sat and puffed at our pipes
Then I said

Well what are you thinking about

Im thinking its time you got a new hat the sun seems to get in
through your old one too much and he got out of my reach and went to
see about penning the calves Before we turned in he said

Well what am I to get out of the job Joe

He had his eye on a doublebarrel gun that Franca the gunsmith in
Cudgeegong hadone barrel shot and the other rifle so I said

How much does Franca want for that gun

Fiveten but I think hed take my single barrel off it Anyway I can
squeeze a couple of quid out of Phil Lambert for the single barrel
Phil was his bosom chum

All right I said Make the best bargain you can

He got his own breakfast and made an early start next morning to get
clear of any instructions or messages that Mary might have forgotten to
give him overnight He took his gun with him

Id always thought that a man was a fool who couldnt keep a secret
from his wifethat there was something womanish about him I found out
Those three days waiting for the buggy were about the longest I ever
spent in my life It made me scotty with every one and everything
and poor Mary had to suffer for it I put in the time patching up the
harness and mending the stockyard and the roof and the third morning
I rode up the ridges to look for trees for fencingtimber I remember I
hurried home that afternoon because I thought the buggy might get there
before me

At teatime I got Mary on to the buggy business

Whats the good of a single buggy to you Mary I asked Theres only
room for two and what are you going to do with the children when we go
out together

We can put them on the floor at our feet like other people do I can
always fold up a blanket or possum rug for them to sit on

But she didnt take half so much interest in buggy talk as she would
have taken at any other time when I didnt want her to Women are
aggravating that way But the poor girl was tired and not very well and
both the children were cross She did look knocked up

Well give the buggy a rest Joe she said I thought I heard it
coming then It seems as far off as ever I dont know why you want to
harp on it today Now dont look so cross JoeI didnt mean to hurt
you Well wait until we can get a double buggy since youre so set on
it Therell be plenty of time when were better off

After tea when the youngsters were in bed and shed washed up we sat
outside on the edge of the verandah floor Mary sewing and I smoking
and watching the track up the creek

Why dont you talk Joe asked Mary You scarcely ever speak to me
now its like drawing blood out of a stone to get a word from you What
makes you so cross Joe

Well Ive got nothing to say

But you should find something Think of meits very miserable for me
Have you anything on your mind Is there any new trouble Better tell
me no matter what it is and not go worrying and brooding and making
both our lives miserable If you never tell one anything how can you
expect me to understand

I said there was nothing the matter

But there must be to make you so unbearable Have you been drinking
Joeor gambling

I asked her what shed accuse me of next

And another thing I want to speak to you about she went on Now
dont knit up your forehead like that Joe and get impatient

Well what is it

I wish you wouldnt swear in the hearing of the children Now little
Jim today he was trying to fix his little gocart and it wouldnt run
right andand

Well what did he say

Hehe she seemed a little hysterical trying not to laughhe said
damn it

I had to laugh Mary tried to keep serious but it was no use

Never mind old woman I said putting an arm round her for her
mouth was trembling and she was crying more than laughing It wont be
always like this Just wait till were a bit better off

Just then a black boy we had I must tell you about him some other time
came sidling along by the wall as if he were afraid somebody was going
to hit himpoor little devil I never did

What is it Harry said Mary

Buggy comin I bin thinkit

Where

He pointed up the creek

Sure its a buggy

Yes missus

How many horses

Onetwo

We knew that he could hear and see things long before we could Mary
went and perched on the woodheap and shaded her eyesthough the sun
had goneand peered through between the eternal grey trunks of the
stunted trees on the flat across the creek Presently she jumped down
and came running in

Theres some one coming in a buggy Joe she cried excitedly And
both my white tablecloths are rough dry Harry put two flatirons down
to the fire quick and put on some more wood Its lucky I kept those
new sheets packed away Get up out of that Joe What are you sitting
grinning like that for Go and get on another shirt HurryWhy Its
only Jamesby himself

She stared at me and I sat there grinning like a fool

Joe she said whose buggy is that

Well I suppose its yours I said

She caught her breath and stared at the buggy and then at me again
James drove down out of sight into the crossing and came up close to
the house

Oh Joe what have you done cried Mary Why its a new double
buggy Then she rushed at me and hugged my head Why didnt you tell
me Joe You poor old boyand Ive been nagging at you all day and
she hugged me again

James got down and started taking the horses outas if it was an
everyday occurrence I saw the doublebarrel gun sticking out from under
the seat Hed stopped to wash the buggy and I suppose thats what made
him grumpy Mary stood on the verandah with her eyes twice as big as
usual and breathing hardtaking the buggy in

James skimmed the harness off and the horses shook themselves and
went down to the dam for a drink Youd better look under the seats
growled James as he took his gun out with great care

Mary dived for the buggy There was a dozen of lemonade and gingerbeer
in a candlebox from GalletlyJames said that Galletlys men had a
gallon of beer and they cheered him James I suppose he meant they
cheered the buggy as he drove off there was a little bit of a
ham from Pat Murphy the storekeeper at Home Rule that hed cured
himselfit was the biggest I ever saw there were three loaves of
bakers bread a cake and a dozen yards of something to make up for
the children from Aunt Gertrude at Gulgong there was a freshwater
cod that long Dave Regan had caught the night before in the Macquarie
river and sent out packed in salt in a box there was a holland suit
for the black boy with red braid to trim it and there was a jar of
preserved ginger and some lollies sweets for the lil boy and
a rumlooking Chinese doll and a rattle for lil girl from Sun Tong
Lee our storekeeper at GulgongJames was chummy with Sun Tong Lee
and got his powder and shot and caps there on tick when he was short of
money And James said that the people would have loaded the buggy with
rubbish if hed waited They all seemed glad to see Joe Wilson getting
onand these things did me good

We got the things inside and I dont think either of us knew what we
were saying or doing for the next halfhour Then James put his head in
and said in a very injured tone

What about my tea I aint had anything to speak of since I left
Cudgeegong I want some grub

Then Mary pulled herself together

Youll have your tea directly she said Pick up that harness at
once and hang it on the pegs in the skillion and you Joe back
that buggy under the end of the verandah the dew will be on it
presentlyand well put wet bags up in front of it tomorrow to
keep the sun off And James will have to go back to Cudgeegong for the
cartwe cant have that buggy to knock about in

All right said Jamesanything Only get me some grub

Mary fried the fish in case it wouldnt keep till the morning and
rubbed over the tablecloths now the irons were hotJames growling
all the timeand got out some crockery she had packed away that had
belonged to her mother and set the table in a style that made James
uncomfortable

I want some grubnot a blooming banquet he said And he growled a
lot because Mary wanted him to eat his fish without a knife and that
sort of Tommyrot When hed finished he took his gun and the black
boy and the dogs and went out possumshooting

When we were alone Mary climbed into the buggy to try the seat and
made me get up alongside her We hadnt had such a comfortable seat for
years but we soon got down in case any one came by for we began to
feel like a pair of fools up there

Then we sat side by side on the edge of the verandah and talked
more than wed done for yearsand there was a good deal of Do you
remember in itand I think we got to understand each other better
that night

And at last Mary said Do you know Joe why I feel tonight
justjust like I did the day we were married

And somehow I had that strange shy sort of feeling too




The Writer Wants to Say a Word


In writing the first sketch of the Joe Wilson series which happened
to be Brightens Sisterinlaw I had an idea of making Joe Wilson a
strong character Whether he is or not the reader must judge It seems
to me that the mans natural sentimental selfishness goodnature
softness or weaknesscall it which you likedeveloped as I wrote
on

I know Joe Wilson very well He has been through deep trouble since the
day he brought the double buggy to Laheys Creek I met him in Sydney
the other day Tall and straight yetrather straighter than he had
beendressed in a comfortable serviceable sac suit of saddletweed
and wearing a new sugarloaf cabbagetree hat he looked over the
hurrying street people calmly as though they were sheep of which he was
not in charge and which were not likely to get boxed with his Not
the worst way in which to regard the world

He talked deliberately and quietly in all that roar and rush He is a
young man yet comparatively speaking but it would take little Mary a
long while now to pick the grey hairs out of his head and the process
would leave him pretty bald

In two or three short sketches in another book I hope to complete the
story of his life




Part II




The Golden Graveyard


Mother Middleton was an awful woman an old hand transported convict
some said The prefix mother in Australia mostly means old hag
and is applied in that sense In early boyhood we understood from
old diggers that Mother Middletonin common with most other old
handshad been sent out for knocking a donkey off a henroost We
had never seen a donkey She drank like a fish and swore like a trooper
when the spirit moved her she went on periodical sprees and swore on
most occasions There was a fearsome yarn which impressed us greatly
as boys to the effect that once in her best or worst days she had
pulled a mounted policeman off his horse and halfkilled him with a
heavy pickhandle which she used for poking down clothes in her boiler
She said that he had insulted her

She could still knock down a tree and cut a load of firewood with any
Bushman she was square and muscular with arms like a navvys she had
often worked shifts below and on top with her husband when hed be
putting down a prospecting shaft without a mate as he often had to
dobecause of her mainly Old diggers said that it was lovely to see
how shed spin up a heavy greenhide bucket full of clay and tailings
and land and empty it with a twist of her wrist Most men were afraid of
her and few diggers wives were strongminded enough to seek a second
row with Mother Middleton Her voice could be heard right across Golden
Gully and Specimen Flat whether raised in argument or in friendly
greeting She came to the old Pipeclay diggings with the rough crowd
mostly Irish and when the old and new Pipeclays were worked out she
went with the rush to Gulgong about the last of the great alluvial or
poormans goldfields and came back to Pipeclay when the Log Paddock
goldfield broke out adjacent to the old fields and so helped prove
the truth of the old diggers saying that no matter how thoroughly
ground has been worked there is always room for a new Ballarat

Jimmy Middleton died at Log Paddock and was buried about the last
in the little old cemeteryappertaining to the old farming town on the
river about four miles awaywhich adjoined the district racecourse in
the Bush on the far edge of Specimen Flat She conducted the funeral
Some said she made the coffin and there were alleged jokes to the
effect that her tongue had provided the corpse but this I think was
unfair and cruel for she loved Jimmy Middleton in her awful way and
was for all I ever heard to the contrary a good wife to him She then
lived in a hut in Log Paddock on a little money in the bank and did
sewing and washing for single diggers

I remember hearing her one morning in neighbourly conversation carried
on across the gully with a selector Peter Olsen who was hopelessly
slaving to farm a dusty patch in the scrub

Why dont you chuck up that dusthole and go up country and settle on
good land Peter Olsen Youre only slaving your stomach out here She
didnt say stomach

Peter Olsen mildwhiskered little man afraid of his wife But then
you know my wife is so delicate Mrs Middleton I wouldnt like to take
her out in the Bush

Mrs Middleton Delicate be damned shes only shamming at her
loudest Why dont you kick her off the bed and the book out of her
hand and make her go to work Shes as delicate as I am Are you a man
Peter Olsen or a

This for the edification of the wife and of all within half a mile

Long Paddock was petering There were a few claims still being worked
down at the lowest end where big redandwhite wasteheaps of clay and
gravel rising above the bluegrey gumbushes advertised deep sinking
and little yellow claystained streams running towards the creek over
the droughtparched surface told of trouble with the water belowtime
lost in baling and extra expense in timbering And diggers came up with
their flannels and moleskins yellow and heavy and dripping with wet
mullock

Most of the diggers had gone to other fields but there were a few
prospecting in parties and singly out on the flats and amongst the
ridges round Pipeclay Sinking holes in search of a new Ballarat

Dave Reganlanky easygoing Bush native Jim Bentlya bit of a Flash
Jack and Andy Pagea character like what Kit in the Old Curiosity
Shop might have been after a voyage to Australia and some Colonial
experience These three were mates from habit and not necessity for
it was all shallow sinking where they worked They were poking down
potholes in the scrub in the vicinity of the racecourse where the
sinking was from ten to fifteen feet

Dave had theoriesideers or notions he called them Jim Bently laid
claim to nonehe ran by sight not scent like a kangaroodog Andy
Pageby the way great admirer and faithful retainer of Dave Reganwas
simple and trusting but on critical occasions he was apt to be
obstinately uncomfortably exasperatingly truthful honest and he had
reverence for higher things

Dave thought hard all one quiet drowsy Sunday afternoon and next
morning he as head of the party started to sink a hole as close to the
cemetery fence as he dared It was a nice quiet spot in the thick scrub
about three panels along the fence from the farthest corner post
from the road They bottomed here at nine feet and found encouraging
indications They drove tunnelled inwards at right angles to the
fence and at a point immediately beneath it they were making tucker
a few feet farther and they were making wages The old alluvial bottom
sloped gently that way The bottom here by the way was shelving
brownish rotten rock

Just inside the cemetery fence and at right angles to Daves drive
lay the shell containing all that was left of the late fiercely lamented
James Middleton with older graves close at each end A grave
was supposed to be six feet deep and local gravediggers had been
conscientious The old alluvial bottom sloped from nine to fifteen feet
here

Dave worked the ground all round from the bottom of his shaft
timberingie putting in a sapling prophere and there where he
worked wide but the payable dirt ran in under the cemetery and in no
other direction

Dave Jim and Andy held a consultation in camp over their pipes
after tea as a result of which Andy next morning rolled up his swag
sorrowfully but firmly shook hands with Dave and Jim and started to
tramp OutBack to look for work on a sheepstation

This was Daves theorydrawn from a little experience and many long
yarns with old diggers

He had bottomed on a slope to an old original watercourse covered with
clay and gravel from the hills by centuries of rains to the depth of
from nine or ten to twenty feet he had bottomed on a gutter running
into the bed of the old buried creek and carrying patches and streaks
of wash or goldbearing dirt If he went on he might strike it rich
at any stroke of his pick he might strike the rich lead which was
supposed to exist round there There was always supposed to be a rich
lead round there somewhere Theres gold in them ridges yetif a man
can only git at it says the toothless old relic of the Roaring Days

Dave might strike a ledge pocket or pothole holding wash rich
with gold He had prospected on the opposite side of the cemetery found
no gold and the bottom sloping upwards towards the graveyard He had
prospected at the back of the cemetery found a few colours and the
bottom sloping downwards towards the point under the cemetery towards
which all indications were now leading him He had sunk shafts across
the road opposite the cemetery frontage and found the sinking twenty
feet and not a colour of gold Probably the whole of the ground under
the cemetery was richmaybe the richest in the district The old
gravediggers had not been golddiggersbesides the graves being six
feet would none of them have touched the alluvial bottom There
was nothing strange in the fact that none of the crowd of experienced
diggers who rushed the district had thought of the cemetery and
racecourse Old brick chimneys and houses the clay for the bricks of
which had been taken from sites of subsequent goldfields had been put
through the crushingmill in subsequent years and had yielded payable
gold Fossicking Chinamen were said to have been the first to detect a
case of this kind

Dave reckoned to strike the lead or a shelf or ledge with a good
streak of wash lying along it at a point about forty feet within the
cemetery But a theory in alluvial goldmining was much like a theory
in gambling in some respects The theory might be right enough but old
volcanic disturbancesthe shrinkage of the earths surface and that
sort of old thingupset everything You might follow good gold along
a ledge just under the grass till it suddenly broke off and the
continuation might be a hundred feet or so under your nose

Had the ground in the cemetery been open Dave would have gone to the
point under which he expected the gold to lie sunk a shaft there and
worked the ground It would have been the quickest and easiest wayit
would have saved the labour and the time lost in dragging heavy buckets
of dirt along a low lengthy drive to the shaft outside the fence But
it was very doubtful if the Government could have been moved to open
the cemetery even on the strongest evidence of the existence of a rich
goldfield under it and backed by the influence of a number of diggers
and their backerswhich last was what Dave wished for least of all He
wanted above all things to keep the thing shady Then again the old
clannish local spirit of the old farming town rooted in years way back
of the goldfields would have been too strong for the Government or
even a rush of wild diggers

Well work this thing on the strict QT said Dave

He and Jim had a consultation by the camp fire outside their tent Jim
grumbled in conclusion

Well then best go under Jimmy Middleton Its the shortest and
straightest and Jimmys the freshest anyway

Then there was another trouble How were they to account for the size of
the wasteheap of clay on the surface which would be the result of such
an extraordinary length of drive or tunnel for shallow sinkings Dave
had an idea of carrying some of the dirt away by night and putting it
down a deserted shaft close by but that would double the labour and
might lead to detection sooner than anything else There were boys
possumhunting on those flats every night Then Dave got an idea

There was supposed to existand it has since been provedanother a
second goldbearing alluvial bottom on that field and several had tried
for it One the town watchmaker had sunk all his money in duffers
trying for the second bottom It was supposed to exist at a depth
of from eighty to a hundred feeton solid rock I suppose This
watchmaker an Italian would put men on to sink and superintend in
person and whenever he came to a little colourshowing shelf or
false bottom thirty or forty feet downhed go rooting round and spoil
the shaft and then start to sink another It was extraordinary that
he hadnt the sense to sink straight down thoroughly test the second
bottom and if he found no gold there to fill the shaft up to the other
bottoms or build platforms at the proper level and then explore them
He was living in a lunatic asylum the last time I heard of him And the
last time I heard from that field they were boring the ground like a
sieve with the latest machinery to find the best place to put down a
deep shaft and finding gold from the second bottom on the bore But Im
right off the line again

Old Pinter Ballarat diggerhis theory on second and other bottoms
ran as follows

Ye see THIS here grass surfacethis here surface with trees an grass
on it that were livin on has got nothin to do with us This here
bottom in the shaller sinkins that were workin on is the slope to the
bed of the NEW crick that was on the surface about the time that men was
missin links The false bottoms thirty or forty feet down kin be said
to have been on the surface about the time that men was monkeys The
SECON bottomeighty or a hundred feet downwas on the surface about
the time when men was frogs Now

But its with the missinglink surface we have to do and had the
friends of the local departed known what Dave and Jim were up to they
would have regarded them as something lower than missinglinks

Well give out were tryin for the second bottom said Dave Regan
Well have to rig a fan for air anyhow and you dont want air in
shallow sinkings

And some one will come poking round and look down the hole and see the
bottom said Jim Bently

We must keep em away said Dave Tar the bottom or cover it with
tarred canvas to make it black Then they wont see it Theres not
many diggers left and the rest are going theyre chucking up the
claims in Log Paddock Besides I could get drunk and pick rows with the
rest and they wouldnt come near me The farmers aint in love with
us diggers so they wont bother us No man has a right to come poking
round another mans claim it aint ettykitIll root up that old
ettykit and stand to itits rather worn out now but thats no matter
Well shift the tent down near the claim and see that no one comes
nosing round on Sunday Theyll think were only some more secondbottom
lunatics like Francea the mining watchmaker Were going to get our
fortune out from under that old graveyard Jim You leave it all to me
till youre born again with brains

Daves schemes were always elaborate and that was why they so often
came to the ground He logged up his windlass platform a little higher
bent about eighty feet of rope to the bole of the windlass which was a
new one and thereafter whenever a suspiciouslooking party that is
to say a digger hove in sight Dave would let down about forty feet of
rope and then wind with simulated exertion until the slack was taken
up and the rope lifted the bucket from the shallow bottom

It would look better to have a whippole and a horse but we cant
afford them just yet said Dave

But Im a little behind They drove straight in under the cemetery
finding good wash all the way The edge of Jimmy Middletons box
appeared in the top corner of the face the working end of the drive
They went under the buttend of the grave They shoved up the end of the
shell with a prop to prevent the possibility of an accident which might
disturb the mound above they puddledie rammedstiff clay up round
the edges to keep the loose earth from dribbling down and having given
the bottom of the coffin a good coat of tar they got over or rather
under an unpleasant matter

Jim Bently smoked and burnt paper during his shift below and grumbled a
good deal Blowed if I ever thought Id be rooting for gold down among
the blanky dead men he said But the dirt panned out better every
dish they washed and Dave worked the wash out right and left as they
drove

But one fine morning who should come along but the very last man
whom Dave wished to see round thereOld Pinter James Poynton
Californian and Victorian digger of the old school Hed been
prospecting down the creek carried his pick over his shoulderthreaded
through the eye in the heft of his bigbladed shorthandled shovel that
hung behindand his golddish under his arm

I mightnt get a chance again to explain what a golddish and what
goldwashing is A gold washingdish is a flat dishnearer the shape
of a bedroom bathtub than anything else I have seen in England or the
dish we used for setting milkI dont know whether the same is used
here the golddish measures say eighteen inches across the top You
get it full of wash dirt squat down at a convenient place at the edge
of the waterhole where there is a rest for the dish in the water just
below its own depth You sink the dish and let the clay and gravel soak
a while then you work and rub it up with your hands and as the clay
dissolves dish it off as muddy water or mullock You are careful to
wash the pebbles in case there is any gold sticking to them And so till
all the muddy or clayey matter is gone and there is nothing but clean
gravel in the bottom of the dish You work this off carefully turning
the dish about this way and that and swishing the water round in it It
requires some practice The gold keeps to the bottom of the dish by
its own weight At last there is only a little halfmoon of sand or fine
gravel in the bottom lower edge of the dishyou work the dish slanting
from you Presently the gold if there was any in the dirt appears in
colours grains or little nuggets along the base of the halfmoon of
sand The more gold there is in the dirt or the coarser the gold is
the sooner it appears A practised digger can work off the last speck of
gravel without losing a colour by just working the water round and
off in the dish Also a careful digger could throw a handful of gold
in a tub of dirt and washing it off in dishfuls recover practically
every colour

The goldwashing cradle is a box shaped something like a boot and
the size of a travelling trunk with rockers on like a babys cradle
and a stick up behind for a handle on top where youll put your foot
into the boot is a tray with a perforated iron bottom the clay and
gravel is thrown on the tray water thrown on it and the cradle rocked
smartly The finer gravel and the mullock goes through and down over a
sloping board covered with blanket and with ledges on it to catch the
gold The dish was mostly used for prospecting large quantities of wash
dirt was put through the horsepower puddlingmachine which there
isnt room to describe here

Ello Dave said Pinter after looking with mild surprise at the size
of Daves wasteheap Tryin for the second bottom

Yes said Dave guttural

Pinter dropped his tools with a clatter at the foot of the wasteheap
and scratched under his ear like an old cockatoo which bird he
resembled Then he went to the windlass and resting his hands on his
knees he peered down while Dave stood by helpless and hopeless

Pinter straightened himself blinking like an owl and looked carelessly
over the graveyard

Tryin for a secon bottom he reflected absently Eh Dave

Dave only stood and looked black

Pinter tilted back his head and scratched the roots of his
chinfeathers which stuck out all round like a dirty ragged fan held
horizontally

Kullers is safe reflected Pinter

All right snapped Dave I suppose we must let him into it

Kullers was a big American buck nigger and had been Pinters mate for
some timePinter was a man of odd mates and what Pinter meant was that
Kullers was safe to hold his tongue

Next morning Pinter and his coloured mate appeared on the ground early
Pinter with some tools and the nigger with a windlassbole on his
shoulders Pinter chose a spot about three panels or thirty feet along
the other fence the back fence of the cemetery and started his hole
He lost no time for the sake of appearances he sunk his shaft and
started to drive straight for the point under the cemetery for which
Dave was making he gave out that he had bottomed on good indications
running in the other direction and would work the ground outside the
fence Meanwhile Dave rigged a fanpartly for the sake of appearances
but mainly because his and Jims lively imaginations made the air in the
drive worse than it really was A fan is a thing like a paddlewheel
rigged in a box about the size of a cradle and something the shape of
a shoe but rounded over the top There is a small grooved wheel on the
axle of the fan outside and an endless line like a clothesline is
carried over this wheel and a groove in the edge of a high light wooden
drivingwheel rigged between two uprights in the rear and with a handle
to turn Thats how the thing is driven A windchute like an endless
pillowslip made of calico with the mouth tacked over the open toe of
the fanbox and the end taken down the shaft and along the drivethis
carries the fresh air into the workings

Dave was working the ground on each side as he went when one morning
a thought struck him that should have struck him the day Pinter went to
work He felt mad that it hadnt struck him sooner

Pinter and Kullers had also shifted their tent down into a nice quiet
place in the Bush close handy so early next Sunday morning while
Pinter and Kullers were asleep Dave posted Jim Bently to watch their
tent and whistle an alarm if they stirred and then dropped down into
Pinters hole and saw at a glance what he was up to

After that Dave lost no time he drove straight on encouraged by the
thuds of Pinters and Kullers picks drawing nearer They would strike
his tunnel at right angles Both parties worked long hours only
knocking off to fry a bit of steak in the pan boil the billy and throw
themselves dressed on their bunks to get a few hours sleep Pinter had
practical experience and a line clear of graves and he made good time
The two parties now found it more comfortable to be not on speaking
terms Individually they grew furtive and began to feel criminal
likeat least Dave and Jim did Theyd start if a horse stumbled
through the Bush and expected to see a mounted policeman ride up at
any moment and hear him ask questions They had driven about thirtyfive
feet when one Saturday afternoon the strain became too great and Dave
and Jim got drunk The spree lasted over Sunday and on Monday morning
they felt too shaky to come to work and had more drink On Monday
afternoon Kullers whose shift it was below stuck his pick through the
face of his drive into the wall of Daves about four feet from the end
of it the clay flaked away leaving a hole as big as a washhand basin
They knocked off for the day and decided to let the other party take the
offensive

Tuesday morning Dave and Jim came to work still feeling shaky Jim
went below crawled along the drive lit his candle and stuck it in the
spiked iron socket and the spike in the wall of the drive quite close
to the hole without noticing either the hole or the increased freshness
in the air He started picking away at the face and scraping the clay
back from under his feet and didnt hear Kullers come to work Kullers
came in softly and decided to try a bit of cheerful bluff He stuck his
great round black face through the hole the whites of his eyes rolling
horribly in the candlelight and said with a deep guffaw

Ullo you dar

No bandicoot ever went into his hole with the dogs after him quicker
than Jim came out of his He scrambled up the shaft by the footholes
and sat on the edge of the wasteheap looking very pale

Whats the matter asked Dave Have you seen a ghost

Ive seen thethe devil gasped Jim ImIm done with this here
ghoul business

The parties got on speaking terms again Dave was very warm but Jims
language was worse Pinter scratched his chinfeathers reflectively till
the other party cooled There was no appealing to the Commissioner for
goldfields they were outside all law whether of the goldfields or
otherwiseso they did the only thing possible and sensible they joined
forces and became Poynton Regan  Party They agreed to work the
ground from the separate shafts and decided to go ahead irrespective
of appearances and get as much dirt out and cradled as possible before
the inevitable exposure came along They found plenty of payable dirt
and soon the drive ended in a cluster of roomy chambers They timbered
up many coffins of various ages burnt tarred canvas and brown
paper and kept the fan going Outside they paid the storekeeper with
difficulty and talked of hard times

But one fine sunny morning after about a week of partnership they got
a bad scare Jim and Kullers were below getting out dirt for all they
were worth and Pinter and Dave at their windlasses when who should
march down from the cemetery gate but Mother Middleton herself She was
a hard woman to look at She still wore the oldfashioned crinoline and
her hair in a greasy net and on this as on most other sober occasions
she wore the expression of a rough Irish navvy who has just enough drink
to make him nasty and is looking out for an excuse for a row She had
a stride like a grenadier A digger had once measured her step by her
footprints in the mud where she had stepped across a gutter it measured
three feet from toe to heel

She marched to the grave of Jimmy Middleton laid a dingy bunch of
flowers thereon with the gesture of an angry man banging his fist down
on the table turned on her heel and marched out The diggers were dirt
beneath her feet Presently they heard her drive on in her springcart
on her way into town and they drew breaths of relief

It was afternoon Dave and Pinter were feeling tired and were just
deciding to knock off work for that day when they heard a scuffling in
the direction of the different shafts and both Jim and Kullers dropped
down and bundled in in a great hurry Jim chuckled in a silly way as if
there was something funny and Kullers guffawed in sympathy

Whats up now demanded Dave apprehensively

Mother Middleton said Jim shes blind mad drunk and shes got a
bottle in one hand and a new pitchfork in the other that shes bringing
out for some one

How the hell did she drop to it exclaimed Pinter

Dunno said Jim Anyway shes coming for us Listen to her

They didnt have to listen hard The language which came down the
shaftthey werent sure which oneand along the drives was enough to
scare up the dead and make them take to the Bush

Why didnt you fools make off into the Bush and give us a chance
instead of giving her a lead here asked Dave

Jim and Kullers began to wish they had done so

Mrs Middleton began to throw stones down the shaftit was Pintersand
they even the oldest and most anxious began to grin in spite of
themselves for they knew she couldnt hurt them from the surface and
that though she had been a working digger herself she couldnt fill
both shafts before the fumes of liquor overtook her

I wonder which shaf shell come down asked Kullers in a tone
befitting the place and occasion

Youd better go and watch your shaft Pinter said Dave and Jim and
Ill watch mine

II wont said Pinter hurriedly ImIm a modest man

Then they heard a clang in the direction of Pinters shaft

Shes thrown her bottle down said Dave

Jim crawled along the drive a piece urged by curiosity and returned
hurriedly

Shes broke the pitchfork off short to use in the drive and I believe
shes coming down

Her crinolinell handicap her said Pinter vacantly thats a
comfort

Shes took it off said Dave excitedly and peering along Pinters
drive they saw first an elasticsided boot then a redstriped
stocking then a section of scarlet petticoat

Lemme out roared Pinter lurching forward and making a swimming
motion with his hands in the direction of Daves drive Kullers
was already gone and Jim well on the way Dave lanky and awkward
scrambled up the shaft last Mrs Middleton made good time considering
she had the darkness to face and didnt know the workings and when Dave
reached the top he had a tear in the leg of his moleskins and the blood
ran from a nasty scratch But he didnt wait to argue over the price of
a new pair of trousers He made off through the Bush in the direction of
an encouraging whistle thrown back by Jim

Shes too drunk to get her story listened to tonight said Dave But
tomorrow shell bring the neighbourhood down on us

And shes enough without the neighbourhood reflected Pinter

Some time after dark they returned cautiously reconnoitred their camp
and after hiding in a hollow log such things as they couldnt carry
they rolled up their tents like the Arabs and silently stole away




The Chinamans Ghost


Simple as striking matches said Dave Regan Bushman but it gave me
the biggest scare I ever hadexcept perhaps the time I stumbled in
the dark into a sixfeet diggers hole which might have been eighty
feet deep for all I knew when I was falling There was an eightyfeet
shaft left open close by

It was the night of the day after the Queens birthday I was sinking a
shaft with Jim Bently and Andy Page on the old Redclay goldfield and
we camped in a tent on the creek Jim and me went to some races that was
held at Peter Andersons pub about four miles across the ridges on
Queens birthday Andy was a quiet sort of chap a teetotaller and
wed disgusted him the last time he was out for a holiday with us so he
stayed at home and washed and mended his clothes and read an arithmetic
book He used to keep the accounts and it took him most of his spare
time

Jim and me had a pretty high time We all got pretty tight after the
races and I wanted to fight Jim or Jim wanted to fight meI dont
remember which We were old chums and we nearly always wanted to fight
each other when we got a bit on and wed fight if we werent stopped I
remember once Jim got maudlin drunk and begged and prayed of me to fight
him as if he was praying for his life Tom Tarrant the coachdriver
used to say that Jim and me must be related else we wouldnt hate each
other so much when we were tight and truthful

Anyway this day Jim got the sulks and caught his horse and went home
early in the evening My dog went home with him too I must have been
carrying on pretty bad to disgust the dog

Next evening I got disgusted with myself and started to walk home Id
lost my hat so Peter Anderson lent me an old one of his that hed worn
on Ballarat he said it was a hard straw flat broadbrimmed affair
and fitted my headache pretty tight Peter gave me a small flask of
whisky to help me home I had to go across some flats and up a long dark
gully called Murderers Gully and over a gap called Dead Mans Gap
and down the ridge and gullies to Redclay Creek The lonely flats
were covered with bluegrey gum bush and looked ghostly enough in the
moonlight and I was pretty shaky but I had a pull at the flask and a
mouthful of water at a creek and felt right enough I began to whistle
and then to sing I never used to sing unless I thought I was a couple
of miles out of earshot of any one

Murderers Gully was deep and pretty dark most times and of course it
was haunted Women and children wouldnt go through it after dark and
even me when Id grown up Id hold my back pretty holler and whistle
and walk quick going along there at nighttime Were all afraid of
ghosts but we wont let on

Some one had skinned a dead calf during the day and left it on the
track and it gave me a jump I promise you It looked like two corpses
laid out naked I finished the whisky and started up over the gap All
of a sudden a great old man kangaroo went across the track with a
thudthud and up the siding and that startled me Then the naked
white glistening trunk of a stringybark tree where some one had
stripped off a sheet of bark started out from a bend in the track in a
shaft of moonlight and that gave me a jerk I was pretty shaky before
I started There was a Chinamans grave close by the track on the top
of the gap An old chow had lived in a hut there for many years and
fossicked on the old diggings and one day he was found dead in the
hut and the Government gave some one a pound to bury him When I was a
nipper we reckoned that his ghost haunted the gap and cursed in Chinese
because the bones hadnt been sent home to China It was a lonely
ghostly place enough

It had been a smotheringly hot day and very close coming across the
flats and up the gullynot a breath of air but now as I got higher I
saw signs of the thunderstorm wed expected all day and felt the breath
of a warm breeze on my face When I got into the top of the gap the
first thing I saw was something white amongst the dark bushes over the
spot where the Chinamans grave was and I stood staring at it with
both eyes It moved out of the shadow presently and I saw that it was
a white bullock and I felt relieved Id hardly felt relieved when all
at once there came a patpatpat of running feet close behind me
I jumped round quick but there was nothing there and while I stood
staring all ways for Sunday there came a patpat then a pause and
then patpatpatpat behind me again it was like some one dodging and
running off that time I started to walk down the track pretty fast
but hadnt gone a dozen yards when patpatpat it was close behind me
again I jerked my eyes over my shoulder but kept my legs going There
was nothing behind but I fancied I saw something slip into the Bush to
the right It must have been the moonlight on the moving boughs there
was a good breeze blowing now I got down to a more level track and
was making across a spur to the main road when patpat patpatpat
patpatpat it was after me again Then I began to runand it began
to run too patpatpat after me all the time I hadnt time to look
round Over the spur and down the siding and across the flat to the road
I went as fast as I could split my legs apart I had a scared idea that
I was getting a touch of the jimjams and that frightened me more
than any outside ghost could have done I stumbled a few times and
saved myself but just before I reached the road I fell slithering
on to my hands on the grass and gravel I thought Id broken both
my wrists I stayed for a moment on my hands and knees quaking and
listening squinting round like a great gohana I couldnt hear nor
see anything I picked myself up and had hardly got on one end when
patpat it was after me again I must have run a mile and a half
altogether that night It was still about threequarters of a mile to
the camp and I ran till my heart beat in my head and my lungs choked up
in my throat I saw our tentfire and took off my hat to run faster The
footsteps stopped then something about the hat touched my fingers and
I stared at itand the thing dawned on me I hadnt noticed at Peter
Andersonsmy head was too swimmy to notice anything It was an old hat
of the style that the first diggers used to wear with a couple of loose
ribbon ends three or four inches long from the band behind As long
as I walked quietly through the gully and there was no wind the tails
didnt flap but when I got up into the breeze they flapped or were
still according to how the wind lifted them or pressed them down flat
on the brim And when I ran they tapped all the time and the hat being
tight on my head the tapping of the ribbon ends against the straw
sounded loud of course

I sat down on a log for a while to get some of my wind back and cool
down and then I went to the camp as quietly as I could and had a long
drink of water

You seem to be a bit winded Dave said Jim Bently and mighty
thirsty Did the Chinamans ghost chase you

I told him not to talk rot and went into the tent and lay down on my
bunk and had a good rest




The Loaded Dog


Dave Regan Jim Bently and Andy Page were sinking a shaft at Stony
Creek in search of a rich gold quartz reef which was supposed to exist
in the vicinity There is always a rich reef supposed to exist in the
vicinity the only questions are whether it is ten feet or hundreds
beneath the surface and in which direction They had struck some
pretty solid rock also water which kept them baling They used the
oldfashioned blastingpowder and timefuse Theyd make a sausage or
cartridge of blastingpowder in a skin of strong calico or canvas the
mouth sewn and bound round the end of the fuse theyd dip the cartridge
in melted tallow to make it watertight get the drillhole as dry as
possible drop in the cartridge with some dry dust and wad and ram with
stiff clay and broken brick Then theyd light the fuse and get out of
the hole and wait The result was usually an ugly pothole in the bottom
of the shaft and half a barrowload of broken rock

There was plenty of fish in the creek freshwater bream cod catfish
and tailers The party were fond of fish and Andy and Dave of fishing
Andy would fish for three hours at a stretch if encouraged by a nibble
or a bite now and thensay once in twenty minutes The butcher was
always willing to give meat in exchange for fish when they caught more
than they could eat but now it was winter and these fish wouldnt
bite However the creek was low just a chain of muddy waterholes
from the hole with a few bucketfuls in it to the sizable pool with an
average depth of six or seven feet and they could get fish by baling
out the smaller holes or muddying up the water in the larger ones
till the fish rose to the surface There was the catfish with spikes
growing out of the sides of its head and if you got pricked youd know
it as Dave said Andy took off his boots tucked up his trousers and
went into a hole one day to stir up the mud with his feet and he knew
it Dave scooped one out with his hand and got pricked and he knew it
too his arm swelled and the pain throbbed up into his shoulder and
down into his stomach too he said like a toothache he had once and
kept him awake for two nightsonly the toothache pain had a burred
edge Dave said

Dave got an idea

Why not blow the fish up in the big waterhole with a cartridge he
said Ill try it

He thought the thing out and Andy Page worked it out Andy usually put
Daves theories into practice if they were practicable or bore the
blame for the failure and the chaffing of his mates if they werent

He made a cartridge about three times the size of those they used in the
rock Jim Bently said it was big enough to blow the bottom out of the
river The inner skin was of stout calico Andy stuck the end of a
sixfoot piece of fuse well down in the powder and bound the mouth of
the bag firmly to it with whipcord The idea was to sink the cartridge
in the water with the open end of the fuse attached to a float on
the surface ready for lighting Andy dipped the cartridge in melted
beeswax to make it watertight Well have to leave it some time
before we light it said Dave to give the fish time to get over their
scare when we put it in and come nosing round again so well want it
well watertight

Round the cartridge Andy at Daves suggestion bound a strip of sail
canvasthat they used for making waterbagsto increase the force of
the explosion and round that he pasted layers of stiff brown paperon
the plan of the sort of fireworks we called guncrackers He let the
paper dry in the sun then he sewed a covering of two thicknesses
of canvas over it and bound the thing from end to end with stout
fishingline Daves schemes were elaborate and he often worked his
inventions out to nothing The cartridge was rigid and solid enough
nowa formidable bomb but Andy and Dave wanted to be sure Andy sewed
on another layer of canvas dipped the cartridge in melted tallow
twisted a length of fencingwire round it as an afterthought dipped it
in tallow again and stood it carefully against a tentpeg where hed
know where to find it and wound the fuse loosely round it Then he
went to the campfire to try some potatoes which were boiling in their
jackets in a billy and to see about frying some chops for dinner Dave
and Jim were at work in the claim that morning

They had a big black young retriever dogor rather an overgrown pup a
big foolish fourfooted mate who was always slobbering round them
and lashing their legs with his heavy tail that swung round like a
stockwhip Most of his head was usually a red idiotic slobbering grin
of appreciation of his own silliness He seemed to take life the world
his twolegged mates and his own instinct as a huge joke Hed retrieve
anything he carted back most of the camp rubbish that Andy threw
away They had a cat that died in hot weather and Andy threw it a good
distance away in the scrub and early one morning the dog found the cat
after it had been dead a week or so and carried it back to camp
and laid it just inside the tentflaps where it could best make
its presence known when the mates should rise and begin to sniff
suspiciously in the sickly smothering atmosphere of the summer sunrise
He used to retrieve them when they went in swimming hed jump in after
them and take their hands in his mouth and try to swim out with them
and scratch their naked bodies with his paws They loved him for his
goodheartedness and his foolishness but when they wished to enjoy a
swim they had to tie him up in camp

He watched Andy with great interest all the morning making the
cartridge and hindered him considerably trying to help but about noon
he went off to the claim to see how Dave and Jim were getting on and to
come home to dinner with them Andy saw them coming and put a panful of
muttonchops on the fire Andy was cook today Dave and Jim stood with
their backs to the fire as Bushmen do in all weathers waiting till
dinner should be ready The retriever went nosing round after something
he seemed to have missed

Andys brain still worked on the cartridge his eye was caught by the
glare of an empty kerosenetin lying in the bushes and it struck him
that it wouldnt be a bad idea to sink the cartridge packed with clay
sand or stones in the tin to increase the force of the explosion He
may have been all out from a scientific point of view but the notion
looked all right to him Jim Bently by the way wasnt interested in
their damned silliness Andy noticed an empty treacletinthe
sort with the little tin neck or spout soldered on to the top for the
convenience of pouring out the treacleand it struck him that this
would have made the best kind of cartridgecase he would only have had
to pour in the powder stick the fuse in through the neck and cork and
seal it with beeswax He was turning to suggest this to Dave when
Dave glanced over his shoulder to see how the chops were doingand
bolted He explained afterwards that he thought he heard the pan
spluttering extra and looked to see if the chops were burning Jim
Bently looked behind and bolted after Dave Andy stood stockstill
staring after them

Run Andy run they shouted back at him Run Look behind you you
fool Andy turned slowly and looked and there close behind him was
the retriever with the cartridge in his mouthwedged into his broadest
and silliest grin And that wasnt all The dog had come round the fire
to Andy and the loose end of the fuse had trailed and waggled over the
burning sticks into the blaze Andy had slit and nicked the firing end
of the fuse well and now it was hissing and spitting properly

Andys legs started with a jolt his legs started before his brain did
and he made after Dave and Jim And the dog followed Andy

Dave and Jim were good runnersJim the bestfor a short distance Andy
was slow and heavy but he had the strength and the wind and could last
The dog leapt and capered round him delighted as a dog could be to find
his mates as he thought on for a frolic Dave and Jim kept shouting
back Dont foller us dont foller us you coloured fool but Andy
kept on no matter how they dodged They could never explain any
more than the dog why they followed each other but so they ran Dave
keeping in Jims track in all its turnings Andy after Dave and the
dog circling round Andythe live fuse swishing in all directions and
hissing and spluttering and stinking Jim yelling to Dave not to follow
him Dave shouting to Andy to go in another directionto spread out
and Andy roaring at the dog to go home Then Andys brain began to work
stimulated by the crisis he tried to get a running kick at the dog but
the dog dodged he snatched up sticks and stones and threw them at the
dog and ran on again The retriever saw that hed made a mistake about
Andy and left him and bounded after Dave Dave who had the presence of
mind to think that the fuses time wasnt up yet made a dive and a grab
for the dog caught him by the tail and as he swung round snatched
the cartridge out of his mouth and flung it as far as he could the dog
immediately bounded after it and retrieved it Dave roared and cursed at
the dog who seeing that Dave was offended left him and went after Jim
who was well ahead Jim swung to a sapling and went up it like a native
bear it was a young sapling and Jim couldnt safely get more than ten
or twelve feet from the ground The dog laid the cartridge as carefully
as if it was a kitten at the foot of the sapling and capered and
leaped and whooped joyously round under Jim The big pup reckoned that
this was part of the larkhe was all right nowit was Jim who was out
for a spree The fuse sounded as if it were going a mile a minute Jim
tried to climb higher and the sapling bent and cracked Jim fell on his
feet and ran The dog swooped on the cartridge and followed It all took
but a very few moments Jim ran to a diggers hole about ten feet deep
and dropped down into itlanding on soft mudand was safe The dog
grinned sardonically down on him over the edge for a moment as if he
thought it would be a good lark to drop the cartridge down on Jim

Go away Tommy said Jim feebly go away

The dog bounded off after Dave who was the only one in sight now Andy
had dropped behind a log where he lay flat on his face having suddenly
remembered a picture of the RussoTurkish war with a circle of
Turks lying flat on their faces as if they were ashamed round a
newlyarrived shell

There was a small hotel or shanty on the creek on the main road not
far from the claim Dave was desperate the time flew much faster in
his stimulated imagination than it did in reality so he made for the
shanty There were several casual Bushmen on the verandah and in the
bar Dave rushed into the bar banging the door to behind him My dog
he gasped in reply to the astonished stare of the publican the blanky
retrieverhes got a live cartridge in his mouth

The retriever finding the front door shut against him had bounded
round and in by the back way and now stood smiling in the doorway
leading from the passage the cartridge still in his mouth and the fuse
spluttering They burst out of that bar Tommy bounded first after one
and then after another for being a young dog he tried to make friends
with everybody

The Bushmen ran round corners and some shut themselves in the stable
There was a new weatherboard and corrugatediron kitchen and washhouse
on piles in the backyard with some women washing clothes inside
Dave and the publican bundled in there and shut the doorthe publican
cursing Dave and calling him a crimson fool in hurried tones and
wanting to know what the hell he came here for

The retriever went in under the kitchen amongst the piles but luckily
for those inside there was a vicious yellow mongrel cattledog sulking
and nursing his nastiness under therea sneaking fighting thieving
canine whom neighbours had tried for years to shoot or poison Tommy
saw his dangerhed had experience from this dogand started out and
across the yard still sticking to the cartridge Halfway across
the yard the yellow dog caught him and nipped him Tommy dropped the
cartridge gave one terrified yell and took to the Bush The yellow dog
followed him to the fence and then ran back to see what he had dropped

Nearly a dozen other dogs came from round all the corners and under the
buildingsspidery thievish coldblooded kangaroodogs mongrel sheep
and cattledogs vicious black and yellow dogsthat slip after you in
the dark nip your heels and vanish without explainingand yapping
yelping small fry They kept at a respectable distance round the nasty
yellow dog for it was dangerous to go near him when he thought he had
found something which might be good for a dog to eat He sniffed at the
cartridge twice and was just taking a third cautious sniff when

It was very good blasting powdera new brand that Dave had recently got
up from Sydney and the cartridge had been excellently well made Andy
was very patient and painstaking in all he did and nearly as handy as
the average sailor with needles twine canvas and rope

Bushmen say that that kitchen jumped off its piles and on again When
the smoke and dust cleared away the remains of the nasty yellow dog
were lying against the paling fence of the yard looking as if he had
been kicked into a fire by a horse and afterwards rolled in the dust
under a barrow and finally thrown against the fence from a distance
Several saddlehorses which had been hangingup round the verandah
were galloping wildly down the road in clouds of dust with broken
bridlereins flying and from a circle round the outskirts from every
point of the compass in the scrub came the yelping of dogs Two of them
went home to the place where they were born thirty miles away and
reached it the same night and stayed there it was not till towards
evening that the rest came back cautiously to make inquiries One was
trying to walk on two legs and most of em looked more or less singed
and a little singed stumpytailed dog who had been in the habit of
hopping the back half of him along on one leg had reason to be glad
that hed saved up the other leg all those years for he needed it
now There was one old oneeyed cattledog round that shanty for years
afterwards who couldnt stand the smell of a gun being cleaned He it
was who had taken an interest only second to that of the yellow dog in
the cartridge Bushmen said that it was amusing to slip up on his blind
side and stick a dirty ramrod under his nose he wouldnt wait to bring
his solitary eye to bearhed take to the Bush and stay out all night

For half an hour or so after the explosion there were several Bushmen
round behind the stable who crouched doubled up against the wall or
rolled gently on the dust trying to laugh without shrieking There
were two white women in hysterics at the house and a halfcaste rushing
aimlessly round with a dipper of cold water The publican was holding
his wife tight and begging her between her squawks to hold up for my
sake Mary or Ill lam the life out of ye

Dave decided to apologise later on when things had settled a bit and
went back to camp And the dog that had done it all Tommy the great
idiotic mongrel retriever came slobbering round Dave and lashing his
legs with his tail and trotted home after him smiling his broadest
longest and reddest smile of amiability and apparently satisfied for
one afternoon with the fun hed had

Andy chained the dog up securely and cooked some more chops while Dave
went to help Jim out of the hole

And most of this is why for years afterwards lanky easygoing
Bushmen riding lazily past Daves camp would cry in a lazy drawl and
with just a hint of the nasal twang

Ello Daave Hows the fishin getting on Daave




Poisonous Jimmy Gets Left




I Dave Regans Yarn


When we got tired of digging about MudgeeBudgee and getting no gold
said Dave Regan Bushman me and my mate Jim Bently decided to take a
turn at droving so we went with Bob Baker the drover overland with a
big mob of cattle way up into Northern Queensland

We couldnt get a job on the home track and we spent most of our
money like a pair of fools at a pub at a town way up over the border
where they had a flash barmaid from Brisbane We sold our packhorses
and packsaddles and rode out of that town with our swags on our
ridinghorses in front of us We had another spree at another place and
by the time we got near New South Wales we were pretty well stumped

Just the other side of Mulgatown near the border we came on a big mob
of cattle in a paddock and a party of drovers camped on the creek They
had brought the cattle down from the north and were going no farther
with them their boss had ridden on into Mulgatown to get the cheques to
pay them off and they were waiting for him

And Poisonous Jimmy is waiting for us said one of them

Poisonous Jimmy kept a shanty a piece along the road from their camp
towards Mulgatown He was called Poisonous Jimmy perhaps on account
of his liquor or perhaps because he had a job of poisoning dingoes on a
station in the Bogan scrubs at one time He was a sharp publican He had
a girl and they said that whenever a shearingshed cutout on his side
and he saw the shearers coming along the road hed say to the girl
Run and get your best frock on Mary Heres the shearers comin And
if a chequeman wouldnt drink hed try to get him into his bar and shout
for him till he was too drunk to keep his hands out of his pockets

But he wont get us said another of the drovers Im going to ride
straight into Mulgatown and send my money home by the post as soon as I
get it

Youve always said that Jack said the first drover

We yarned a while and had some tea and then me and Jim got on our
horses and rode on We were burned to bricks and ragged and dusty and
parched up enough and so were our horses We only had a few shillings
to carry us four or five hundred miles home but it was mighty hot and
dusty and we felt that we must have a drink at the shanty This was
west of the sixpennyline at that timeall drinks were a shilling along
here

Just before we reached the shanty I got an idea

Well plant our swags in the scrub I said to Jim

What for said Jim

Never mindyoull see I said

So we unstrapped our swags and hid them in the mulga scrub by the
side of the road then we rode on to the shanty got down and hung our
horses to the verandah posts

Poisonous came out at once with a smile on him that would have made
anybody homesick

He was a short nuggety man and could use his hands they said he
looked as if hed be a nasty vicious cool customer in a fighthe
wasnt the sort of man youd care to try and swindle a second time
He had a monkey shave when he shaved but now it was all frill and
stubblelike a bush fence round a stubblefield He had a broken nose
and a cunning sharp suspicious eye that squinted and a cold stony eye
that seemed fixed If you didnt know him well you might talk to him for
five minutes looking at him in the cold stony eye and then discover
that it was the sharp cunning little eye that was watching you all the
time It was awful embarrassing It must have made him awkward to deal
with in a fight

Good day mates he said

Good day we said

Its hot

Its hot

We went into the bar and Poisonous got behind the counter

What are you going to have he asked rubbing up his glasses with a
rag

We had two longbeers

Never mind that said Poisonous seeing me put my hand in my pocket
its my shout I dont suppose your boss is back yet I saw him go in
to Mulgatown this morning

No he aint back I said I wish he was Were getting tired of
waiting for him Well give him another hour and then some of us will
have to ride in to see whether hes got on the boose and get hold of
him if he has

I suppose youre waiting for your cheques he said turning to fix
some bottles on the shelf

Yes I said we are and I winked at Jim and Jim winked back as
solemn as an owl

Poisonous asked us all about the trip and how long wed been on the
track and what sort of a boss we had dropping the questions offhand
now an then as for the sake of conversation We could see that he
was trying to get at the size of our supposed cheques so we answered
accordingly

Have another drink he said and he filled the pewters up again
Its up to me and he set to work boring out the glasses with his rag
as if he was shorthanded and the bar was crowded with customers and
screwing up his face into what I suppose he considered an innocent or
unconscious expression The girl began to sidle in and out with a smart
frock and a seeyouafterdark smirk on

Have you had dinner she asked We could have done with a good meal
but it was too riskythe drovers boss might come along while we were
at dinner and get into conversation with Poisonous So we said wed had
dinner

Poisonous filled our pewters again in an offhand way

I wish the boss would come said Jim with a yawn I want to get into
Mulgatown tonight and I want to get some shirts and things before I go
in I aint got a decent rag to me back I dont suppose theres ten bob
amongst the lot of us

There was a general store back on the creek near the drovers camp

Oh go to the store and get what you want said Poisonous taking a
sovereign from the till and tossing it on to the counter You can fix
it up with me when your boss comes Bring your mates along

Thank you said Jim taking up the sovereign carelessly and dropping
it into his pocket

Well Jim I said suppose we get back to camp and see how the chaps
are getting on

All right said Jim

Tell them to come down and get a drink said Poisonous or wait
you can take some beer along to them if you like and he gave us half
a gallon of beer in a billycan He knew what the first drink meant with
Bushmen back from a long dry trip

We got on our horses I holding the billy very carefully and rode back
to where our swags were

I say said Jim when wed strapped the swags to the saddles
suppose we take the beer back to those chaps its meant for them and
its only a fair thing anywayweve got as much as we can hold till we
get into Mulgatown

It might get them into a row I said and they seem decent chaps
Lets hang the billy on a twig and that old swagman thats coming along
will think theres angels in the Bush

Oh whats a row said Jim They can take care of themselves
theyll have the beer anyway and a lark with Poisonous when they take
the can back and it comes to explanations Ill ride back to them

So Jim rode back to the drovers camp with the beer and when he came
back to me he said that the drovers seemed surprised but they drank
good luck to him

We rode round through the mulga behind the shanty and came out on the
road again on the Mulgatown side we only stayed at Mulgatown to buy
some tucker and tobacco then we pushed on and camped for the night
about seven miles on the safe side of the town




II Told by One of the Other Drovers


Talkin o Poisonous Jimmy I can tell you a yarn about him Wed
brought a mob of cattle down for a squatter the other side of Mulgatown
We camped about seven miles the other side of the town waitin for the
station hands to come and take charge of the stock while the boss rode
on into town to draw our money Some of us was goin back though in
the end we all went into Mulgatown and had a boose up with the boss But
while we was waitin there come along two fellers that had been drovin
up north They yarned a while an then went on to Poisonous Jimmys
place an in about an hour one on em come ridin back with a can of
beer that he said Poisonous had sent for us We all knew Jimmys little
gamesthe beer was a bait to get us on the drunk at his place but we
drunk the beer and reckoned to have a lark with him afterwards When
the boss come back an the station hands to take the bullocks we
started into Mulgatown We stopped outside Poisonouss place an handed
the can to the girl that was grinnin on the verandah Poisonous come
out with a grin on him like a parson with a broken nose

Good day boys he says

Good day Poisonous we says

Its hot he says

Its blanky hot I says

He seemed to expect us to get down Where are you off to he says

Mulgatown I says It will be cooler there and we sung out
Solong Poisonous and rode on

He stood starin for a minute then he started shoutin Hi hi
there after us but we took no notice an rode on When we looked
back last he was runnin into the scrub with a bridle in his hand

We jogged along easily till we got within a mile of Mulgatown when
we heard somebody gallopin after us an lookin back we saw it was
Poisonous

He was too mad and too winded to speak at first so he rode along with
us a bit gasping then he burst out

Wheres them other two carnal blanks he shouted

What other two I asked Were all here Whats the matter with you
anyway

All here he yelled Youre a lurid liar What the flamin sheol do
you mean by swiggin my beer an flingin the coloured can in me face
without as much as thank yer Dyer think Im a flamin

Oh but Poisonous Jimmy was wild

Well well pay for your dirty beer says one of the chaps puttin
his hand in his pocket We didnt want yer slush It tasted as if it
had been used before

Pay for it yelled Jimmy Illwell take it out of one of yer
bleedin hides

We stopped at once and I got down an obliged Jimmy for a few rounds
He was a nasty customer to fight he could use his hands and was cool
as a cucumber as soon as he took his coat off besides he had one
squirmy little business eye and a big walleye an even if you knowed
him well you couldnt help watchin the stony eyeit was no good
watchin his eyes you had to watch his hands and he might have
managed me if the boss hadnt stopped the fight The boss was a big
quietvoiced man that didnt swear

Now look here Myles said the boss Jimmys name was MylesNow
look here Myles sez the boss whats all this about

Whats all this about says Jimmy gettin excited agen Why two
fellers that belonged to your party come along to my place an put up
halfadozen drinks an borrered a sovereign an got a can o beer on
the strength of their cheques They sez they was waitin for youan I
want my crimson money out o some one

What was they like asks the boss

Like shouted Poisonous swearin all the time One was a blanky
long sandy sawny feller and the other was a short slim feller with
black hair Your blanky men knows all about them because they had the
blanky billy o beer

Now whats this all about you chaps sez the boss to us

So we told him as much as we knowed about them two fellers

Ive heard men swear that could swear in a rough shearinshed but I
never heard a man swear like Poisonous Jimmy when he saw how hed been
left It was enough to split stumps He said he wanted to see those
fellers just once before he died

He rode with us into Mulgatown got mad drunk an started out along
the road with a tomahawk after the long sandy feller and the slim dark
feller but two mounted police went after him an fetched him back He
said he only wanted justice he said he only wanted to stun them two
fellers till he could give em in charge

They fined him ten bob




The Ghostly Door

Told by one of Daves mates



Dave and I were tramping on a lonely Bush track in New Zealand making
for a sawmill where we expected to get work and we were caught in one
of those threedays gales with rain and hail in it and cold enough to
cut off a mans legs Camping out was not to be thought of so we
just tramped on in silence with the stinging pain coming between our
shoulderbladesfrom cold weariness and the weight of our swagsand
our boots full of water going splosh splosh splosh along the
track We were settled to itto drag on like wet weary muddy working
bullocks till we came to somewherewhen just before darkness settled
down we saw the loom of a humpy of some sort on the slope of a
tussock hill back from the road and we made for it without holding a
consultation

It was a tworoomed hut built of waste timber from a sawmill and was
either a deserted settlers home or a hut attached to an abandoned
sawmill round there somewhere The windows were boarded up We dumped
our swags under the little verandah and banged at the door to make
sure then Dave pulled a couple of boards off a window and looked in
there was light enough to see that the place was empty Dave pulled
off some more boards put his arm in through a broken pane clicked the
catch back and then pushed up the window and got in I handed in the
swags to him The room was very draughty the wind came in through
the broken window and the cracks between the slabs so we tried the
partitionedoff roomthe bedroomand that was better It had been
lined with chaffbags and there were two stretchers left by some
timbergetters or other Bush contractors whod camped there last and
there were a box and a couple of threelegged stools

We carried the remnant of the woodheap inside made a fire and put
the billy on We unrolled our swags and spread the blankets on the
stretchers and then we stripped and hung our clothes about the fire
to dry There was plenty in our tuckerbags so we had a good feed I
hadnt shaved for days and Dave had a coarse red beard with a twist in
it like an illused fibre brusha beard that got redder the longer it
grew he had a hooked nose and his hair stood straight up I never saw
a man so easygoing about the expression and so scared about the head
and he was very tall with long thin hairy legs We must have looked a
weird pair as we sat there naked on the low threelegged stools with
the billy and the tucker on the box between us and ate our bread and
meat with claspknives

I shouldnt wonder says Dave but this is the whare where the
murder was that we heard about along the road I suppose if any one was
to come along now and look in hed get scared Then after a while he
looked down at the flooringboards close to my feet and scratched
his ear and said That looks very much like a bloodstain under your
stool doesnt it Jim

  Whare whorrie Maori name for house

I shifted my feet and presently moved the stool farther away from the
fireit was too hot

I wouldnt have liked to camp there by myself but I dont think Dave
would have mindedhed knocked round too much in the Australian Bush to
mind anything much or to be surprised at anything besides he was more
than half murdered once by a man who said afterwards that hed mistook
him for some one else he must have been a very shortsighted murderer

Presently we put tobacco matches and bits of candle we had on the two
stools by the heads of our bunks turned in and filled up and smoked
comfortably dropping in a lazy word now and again about nothing in
particular Once I happened to look across at Dave and saw him sitting
up a bit and watching the door The door opened very slowly wide and
a black cat walked in looked first at me then at Dave and walked out
again and the door closed behind it

Dave scratched his ear Thats rum he said I could have sworn I
fastened that door They must have left the cat behind

It looks like it I said Neither of us has been on the boose
lately

He got out of bed and up on his long hairy spindleshanks

The door had the ordinary common black oblong lock with a brass knob
Dave tried the latch and found it fast he turned the knob opened the
door and called Pusspusspuss but the cat wouldnt come He shut
the door tried the knob to see that the catch had caught and got into
bed again

Hed scarcely settled down when the door opened slowly the black cat
walked in stared hard at Dave and suddenly turned and darted out as
the door closed smartly

I looked at Dave and he looked at mehard then he scratched the back
of his head I never saw a man look so puzzled in the face and scared
about the head

He got out of bed very cautiously took a stick of firewood in his hand
sneaked up to the door and snatched it open There was no one there
Dave took the candle and went into the next room but couldnt see the
cat He came back and sat down by the fire and meowed and presently
the cat answered him and came in from somewhereshed been outside
the window I suppose he kept on meowing and she sidled up and rubbed
against his hairy shin Dave could generally bring a cat that way
He had a weakness for cats Id seen him kick a dog and hammer a
horsebrutally I thoughtbut I never saw him hurt a cat or let any
one else do it Dave was good to cats if a cat had a family where Dave
was round hed see her all right and comfortable and only drown a fair
surplus He said once to me I can understand a man kicking a dog or
hammering a horse when it plays up but I cant understand a man hurting
a cat

He gave this cat something to eat Then he went and held the light close
to the lock of the door but could see nothing wrong with it He found a
key on the mantelshelf and locked the door He got into bed again and
the cat jumped up and curled down at the foot and started her old drum
going like shot in a sieve Dave bent down and patted her to tell her
hed meant no harm when he stretched out his legs and then he settled
down again

We had some books of the Deadwood Dick school Dave was reading The
Grisly Ghost of the Haunted Gulch and I had The Dismembered Hand
or The Disembowelled Corpse or some such names They were firstclass
preparation for a ghost

I was reading away and getting drowsy when I noticed a movement and
saw Daves frightened head rising with the terrified shadow of it on
the wall He was staring at the door over his book with both eyes
And that door was opening againslowlyand Dave had locked it I never
felt anything so creepy the foot of my bunk was behind the door and
I drew up my feet as it came open it opened wide and stood so We
waited for five minutes it seemed hearing each other breathe watching
for the door to close then Dave got out very gingerly and up on one
end and went to the door like a cat on wet bricks

You shot the bolt OUTSIDE the catch I said as he caught hold of the
doorlike one grabs a crawfish

Ill swear I didnt said Dave But hed already turned the key a
couple of times so he couldnt be sure He shut and locked the door
again Now get out and see for yourself he said

I got out and tried the door a couple of times and found it all right
Then we both tried and agreed that it was locked

I got back into bed and Dave was about half in when a thought struck
him He got the heaviest piece of firewood and stood it against the
door

What are you doing that for I asked

If theres a brokendown burglar camped round here and trying any of
his funny business well hear him if he tries to come in while were
asleep says Dave Then he got back into bed We composed our nerves
with the Haunted Gulch and The Disembowelled Corpse and after a
while I heard Dave snore and was just dropping off when the stick fell
from the door against my big toe and then to the ground with tremendous
clatter I snatched up my feet and sat up with a jerk and so did
Davethe cat went over the partition That door opened only a little
way this time paused and shut suddenly Dave got out grabbed a stick
skipped to the door and clutched at the knob as if it were a nettle
and the door wouldnt comeit was fast and locked Then Daves face
began to look as frightened as his hair He lit his candle at the fire
and asked me to come with him he unlocked the door and we went into the
other room Dave shading his candle very carefully and feeling his way
slow with his feet The room was empty we tried the outer door and
found it locked

It muster gone by the winder whispered Dave I noticed that he said
it instead of he I saw that he himself was shook up and it only
needed that to scare me bad

We went back to the bedroom had a drink of cold tea and lit our pipes
Then Dave took the waterproof cover off his bunk spread it on the
floor laid his blankets on top of it his spare clothes c on top of
them and started to roll up his swag

What are you going to do Dave I asked

Im going to take the track says Dave and camp somewhere farther
on You can stay here if you like and come on in the morning

I started to roll up my swag at once We dressed and fastened on the
tuckerbags took up the billies and got outside without making any
noise We held our backs pretty hollow till we got down on to the road

That comes of camping in a deserted house said Dave when we were
safe on the track No Australian Bushman cares to camp in an abandoned
homestead or even near itprobably because a deserted home looks
ghostlier in the Australian Bush than anywhere else in the world

It was blowing hard but not raining so much

We went on along the track for a couple of miles and camped on the
sheltered side of a round tussock hill in a hole where there had been a
landslip We used all our candleends to get a fire alight but once we
got it started we knocked the wet bark off manuka sticks and logs and
piled them on and soon had a roaring fire When the ground got a little
drier we rigged a bit of shelter from the showers with some sticks and
the oilcloth swagcovers then we made some coffee and got through the
night pretty comfortably In the morning Dave said Im going back to
that house

What for I said

Im going to find out whats the matter with that crimson door If I
dont Ill never be able to sleep easy within a mile of a door so long
as I live

So we went back It was still blowing The thing was simple enough by
daylightafter a little watching and experimenting The house was built
of odds and ends and badly fitted It gave in the wind in almost any
directionnot much not more than an inch or so but just enough to
throw the doorframe out of plumb and out of square in such a way as to
bring the latch and bolt of the lock clear of the catch the doorframe
was of scraps joined Then the door swung open according to the hang of
it and when the gust was over the house gave back and the door swung
tothe frame easing just a little in another direction I suppose
it would take Edison to invent a thing like that that came about by
accident The different strengths and directions of the gusts of wind
must have accounted for the variations of the doors movementsand
maybe the draught of our big fire had helped

Dave scratched his head a good bit

I never lived in a house yet he said as we came awayI never lived
in a house yet without there was something wrong with it Gimme a good
tent




A Wild Irishman


About seven years ago I drifted from OutBack in Australia to
Wellington the capital of New Zealand and up country to a little town
called Pahiatua which meaneth the home of the gods and is situated
in the Wairarappa rippling or sparkling water district They have a
pretty little legend to the effect that the name of the district was not
originally suggested by its rivers streams and lakes but by the
tears alleged to have been noticed by a dusky squire in the eyes of
a warrior chief who was looking his first or lastI dont remember
whichupon the scene He was the discoverer I suppose now I come to
think of it else the place would have been already named Maybe the
scene reminded the old cannibal of the home of his childhood

Pahiatua was not the home of my god and it rained for five weeks
While waiting for a remittance from an Australian newspaperwhich I
anxiously hoped would arrive in time for enough of it to be left after
paying board to take me away somewhereI spent many hours in the
little shop of a shoemaker who had been a digger and he told me yarns
of the old days on the West Coast of Middle Island And ever and anon
he returned to one a hardcase from the West Coast called The Flour
of Wheat and his cousin and his mate Dinny Murphy dead And ever
and again the shoemaker he was large humorous and goodnatured made
me promise that when I dropped across an old West Coast diggerno
matter who or what he was or whether he was drunk or soberId ask him
if he knew the Flour of Wheat and hear what he had to say

I make no attempt to give any one shade of the Irish brogueit cant be
done in writing


Theres the little red Irishman said the shoemaker who was Irish
himself who always wants to fight when he has a glass in him and
theres the big sarcastic dark Irishman who makes more trouble and
fights at a spree than halfadozen little red ones put together
and theres the cheerful easygoing Irishman Now the Flour was a
combination of all three and several other sorts He was known from the
first amongst the boys at Th Canary as the Flour o Wheat but no one
knew exactly why Some said that the right name was the Flower not
Flour and that he was called that because there was no flower on
wheat The name might have been a compliment paid to the mans character
by some one who understood and appreciated itor appreciated it without
understanding it Or it might have come of some chance saying of the
Flour himself or his matesor an accident with bags of flour He might
have worked in a mill But weve had enough of that Its the mannot
the name He was just a big dark blueeyed Irish digger He worked
hard drank hard fought hardand didnt swear No man had ever heard
him swear except once all things were lovely with him He was
always lucky He got gold and threw it away

The Flour was sent out to Australia by his friends in connection with
some trouble in Ireland in eighteensomething The date doesnt matter
there was mostly trouble in Ireland in those days and nobody that
knew the man could have the slightest doubt that he helped the
troubleprovided he was there at the time I heard all this from a man
who knew him in Australia The relatives that he was sent out to were
soon very anxious to see the end of him He was as wild as they made
them in Ireland When he had a few drinks hed walk restlessly to and
fro outside the shanty swinging his right arm across in front of him
with elbow bent and hand closed as if he had a head in chancery and
muttering as though in explanation to himself

Oi must be walkin or foightinOi must be walkin or foightinOi
must be walkin or foightin

They say that he wanted to eat his Australian relatives before he was
done and the story goes that one night while he was on the spree they
put their belongings into a cart and took to the Bush

Theres no floury record for several years then the Flour turned up on
the west coast of New Zealand and was never very far from a pub kept
by a cousin that he had tracked unearthed or discovered somehow at a
place called Th Canary I remember the first time I saw the Flour

I was on a bit of a spree myself at Th Canary and one evening I was
standing outside Bradys the Flours cousins place with Tom Lyons and
Dinny Murphy when I saw a big man coming across the flat with a swag on
his back

B God theres the Flour o Wheat comin this minute says Dinny
Murphy to Tom an no one else

B God yere right says Tom

There were a lot of new chums in the big room at the back drinking and
dancing and singing and Tom says to Dinny

Dinny Ill bet you a quid an the Flourll run against some of those
new chums before hes an hour on the spot

But Dinny wouldnt take him up He knew the Flour

Good day Tom Good day Dinny

Good day to you Flour

I was introduced

Well boys come along says the Flour

And so we went inside with him The Flour had a few drinks and then
he went into the backroom where the new chums were One of them was
dancing a jig and so the Flour stood up in front of him and commenced
to dance too And presently the new chum made a step that didnt please
the Flour so he hit him between the eyes and knocked him downfair
an flat on his back

Take that he says Take that me lovely whippersnapper an lay
there You cant dance How dare ye stand up in front of me face to
dance when ye cant dance

He shouted and drank and gambled and danced and sang and fought
the new chums all night and in the morning he said

Well boys we had a grand time last night Come and have a drink with
me

And of course they went in and had a drink with him

 

Next morning the Flour was walking along the street when he met a
drunken disreputable old hag known among the boys as the Nipper

Good MORNING me lovely Flour o Wheat says she

Good MORNING me lovely Nipper says the Flour

And with that she outs with a bottle she had in her dress and smashed
him across the face with it Broke the bottle to smithereens

A policeman saw her do it and took her up and they had the Flour as a
witness whether he liked it or not And a lovely sight he looked with
his face all done up in bloody bandages and only one damaged eye and a
corner of his mouth on duty

Its nothing at all your Honour he said to the SM only a
pinscratchits nothing at all Let it pass I had no right to speak
to the lovely woman at all

But they didnt let it passthey fined her a quid

And the Flour paid the fine

But alas for human nature It was pretty much the same even in those
days and amongst those men as it is now A man couldnt do a woman
a good turn without the dirtyminded blackguards taking it for granted
there was something between them It was a great joke amongst the boys
who knew the Flour and who also knew the Nipper but as it was carried
too far in some quarters it got to be no joke to the Flournor to
those who laughed too loud or grinned too long

 

The Flours cousin thought he was a sharp man The Flour got stiff
He hadnt any money and his credit had run out so he went and got
a blank summons from one of the police he knew He pretended that he
wanted to frighten a man who owed him some money Then he filled it up
and took it to his cousin

What dye think of that he says handing the summons across the bar
What dye think of me lovely Dinny Murphy now

Why whats this all about

Thats what I want to know I borrowed a fivepoundnote off of him a
fortnight ago when I was drunk an now he sends me that

Well I never would have dreamd that of Dinny says the cousin
scratching his head and blinking Whats come over him at all

Thats what I want to know

What have you been doing to the man

Divil a thing that Im aware of

The cousin rubbed his chintuft between his forefinger and thumb

Well what am I to do about it asked the Flour impatiently

Do Pay the man of course

How can I pay the lovely man when I havent got the price of a drink
about me

The cousin scratched his chin

Wellhere Ill lend you a fivepoundnote for a month or two Go and
pay the man and get back to work

And the Flour went and found Dinny Murphy and the pair of them had a
howling spree together up at Bradys the opposition pub And the cousin
said he thought all the time he was being had

     

He was nasty sometimes when he was about half drunk For instance
hed come on the ground when the Orewell sports were in full swing and
walk round soliloquising just loud enough for you to hear and just
when a big event was coming off hed pass within earshot of some
committee menwho had been bursting themselves for weeks to work the
thing up and make it a successsaying to himself

Wheres the Orewell sports that I hear so much about I dont see
them Can any one direct me to the Orewell sports

Or hed pass a raffle lottery luckybag or goldenbarrel business of
some sort

No gamblin for the Flour I dont believe in their little shwindles
It ought to be shtopped Leadin young people ashtray

Or hed pass an Englishman he didnt like

Look at Jinneral Roberts Hes a man Hes an Irishman England has
to come to Ireland for its Jinnerals Luk at Jinneral Roberts in the
marshes of Candyhar

 

They always had sports at Orewell Creek on New Years Dayexcept
onceand old Duncan was always therenever missed it till the day he
died He was a digger a humorous and goodhearted hardcase They all
knew old Duncan

But one New Years Eve he didnt turn up and was missed at once
Wheres old Duncan Any one seen old Duncan Oh hell turn up
alright They inquired and argued and waited but Duncan didnt come

Duncan was working at Duffers The boys inquired of fellows who came
from Duffers but they hadnt seen him for two days They had fully
expected to find him at the creek He wasnt at Aliaura nor Notown They
inquired of men who came from Nelson Creek but Duncan wasnt there

Theres something happened to the lovely man said the Flour of Wheat
at last Some of us had better see about it

Pretty soon this was the general opinion and so a party started out
over the hills to Duffers before daylight in the morning headed by the
Flour


The door of Duncans whare was closedBUT NOT PADLOCKED The Flour
noticed this gave his head a jerk opened the door and went in The
hut was tidied up and swept outeven the fireplace Duncan had lifted
the boxes and cleaned up and his little bag of gold stood on a
shelf by his sideall ready for his spree On the table lay a clean
neckerchief folded ready to tie on The blankets had been folded neatly
and laid on the bunk and on them was stretched Old Duncan with his
arms lying crossed on his chest and one footwith a boot onresting
on the ground He had his clean things on and was dressed except for
one boot the necktie and his hat Heart disease

Take your hats off and come in quietly lads said the Flour Heres
the lovely man lying dead in his bunk

There were no sports at Orewell that New Year Some one said that the
crowd from Nelson Creek might object to the sports being postponed on
old Duncans account but the Flour said hed see to that

One or two did object but the Flour reasoned with them and there were
no sports

And the Flour used to say afterwards Ah but it was a grand time we
had at the funeral when Duncan died at Duffers

     

The Flour of Wheat carried his mate Dinny Murphy all the way in from
Th Canary to the hospital on his back Dinny was very badthe man was
dying of the dysentery or something The Flour laid him down on a spare
bunk in the receptionroom and hailed the staff

Inside therecome out

The doctor and some of the hospital people came to see what was the
matter The doctor was a heavy swell with a big cigar held up in front
of him between two fat soft yellowwhite fingers and a dandy little
pair of goldrimmed eyeglasses nipped onto his nose with a spring

Theres me lovely mate lying there dying of the dysentry says the
Flour and youve got to fix him up and bring him round

Then he shook his fist in the doctors face and said

If you let that lovely man dielook out

The doctor was startled He backed off at first then he took a puff at
his cigar stepped forward had a careless look at Dinny and gave some
order to the attendants The Flour went to the door turned half round
as he went out and shook his fist at them again and said

If you let that lovely man diemind

In about twenty minutes he came back wheeling a case of whisky in a
barrow He carried the case inside and dumped it down on the floor

There he said pour that into the lovely man

Then he shook his fist at such members of the staff as were visible
and said

If you let that lovely man dielook out

They were used to hardcases and didnt take much notice of him but
he had the hospital in an awful mess he was there all hours of the day
and night he would go down town have a few drinks and a fight maybe
and then hed say Ah well Ill have to go up and see how me lovely
mates getting on

And every time hed go up hed shake his fist at the hospital in
general and threaten to murder em all if they let Dinny Murphy die

Well Dinny Murphy died one night The next morning the Flour met the
doctor in the street and hauled off and hit him between the eyes and
knocked him down before he had time to see who it was

Stay there ye little whippersnapper said the Flour of Wheat you
let that lovely man die

The police happened to be out of town that day and while they were
waiting for them the Flour got a coffin and carried it up to the
hospital and stood it on end by the doorway

Ive come for me lovely mate he said to the scared staffor as much
of it as he baled up and couldnt escape him Hand him over Hes going
back to be buried with his friends at Th Canary Now dont be sneaking
round and sidling off you there you neednt be frightened Ive
settled with the doctor

But they called in a man who had some influence with the Flour and
between themand with the assistance of the prettiest nurse on the
premisesthey persuaded him to wait Dinny wasnt ready yet there were
papers to sign it wouldnt be decent to the dead he had to be
prayed over he had to be washed and shaved and fixed up decent and
comfortable Anyway theyd have him ready in an hour or take the
consequences

The Flour objected on the ground that all this could be done equally as
well and better by the boys at Th Canary However he said Ill
be round in an hour and if you havent got me lovely mate readylook
out Then he shook his fist sternly at them once more and said

I know yer dirty tricks and dodges and if theres eer a pinscratch
on me mates bodylook out If theres a pairin of Dinnys toenail
missinlook out

Then he went outtaking the coffin with him

And when the police came to his lodgings to arrest him they found the
coffin on the floor by the side of the bed and the Flour lying in it on
his back with his arms folded peacefully on his bosom He was as
dead drunk as any man could get to be and still be alive They knocked
airholes in the coffinlid screwed it on and carried the coffin the
Flour and all to the local lockup They laid their burden down on the
bare cold floor of the prisoncell and then went out locked the door
and departed several ways to put the boys up to it And about midnight
the boys gathered round with a supply of liquor and waited and
somewhere along in the small hours there was a howl as of a strong
Irishman in Purgatory and presently the voice of the Flour was heard to
plead in changed and awful tones

Pray for me soul boyspray for me soul Let bygones be bygones
between us boys and pray for me lovely soul The lovely Flours in
Purgatory

Then silence for a while and then a sound like a draywheel passing
over a packingcase That was the only time on record that the Flour
was heard to swear And he swore then

They didnt pray for himthey gave him a month And when he came
out he went halfway across the road to meet the doctor and heto his
credit perhapscame the other half They had a drink together and
the Flour presented the doctor with a fine specimen of coarse gold for a
pin

It was the will o God after all doctor said the Flour It was
the will o God Let bygones be bygones between us gimme your hand
doctor Goodbye

Then he left for Th Canary




The Babies in the Bush


 Oh tell her a tale of the fairies bright
 That only the Bushmen know
 Who guide the feet of the lost aright
 Or carry them up through the starry night
 Where the Bushlost babies go


He was one of those men who seldom smile There are many in the
Australian Bush where drift wrecks and failures of all stations and
professions and of none and from all the world Or if they do smile
the smile is either mechanical or bitter as a rulecynical They seldom
talk The sort of men who as bosses are set down by the majorityand
without reason or evidenceas being proud hard and selfishtoo
mean to live and too big for their boots

But when the Boss did smile his expression was very very gentle and
very sad I have seen him smile down on a little child who persisted in
sitting on his knee and prattling to him in spite of his silence and
gloom He was tall and gaunt with haggard grey eyeshaunted grey eyes
sometimesand hair and beard thick and strong but grey He was not
above fortyfive He was of the type of men who die in harness with
their hair thick and strong but grey or white when it should be brown
The opposite type I fancy would be the soft darkhaired blueeyed
men who grow bald sooner than they grow grey and fat and contented and
die respectably in their beds

His name was HeadWalter Head He was a boss drover on the overland
routes I engaged with him at a place north of the Queensland border to
travel down to Bathurst on the Great Western Line in New South Wales
with something over a thousand head of store bullocks for the Sydney
market I am an Australian Bushman with city experiencea rover of
course and a neerdowell I suppose I was born with brains and a
thin skinworse luck It was in the days before I was married and I
went by the name of Jack Ellis this tripnot because the police
were after me but because I used to tell yarns about a man named Jack
Ellisand so the chaps nicknamed me

The Boss spoke little to the men hed sit at tucker or with his pipe
by the campfire nearly as silently as he rode his nightwatch round the
big restless weirdlooking mob of bullocks camped on the dusky
starlit plain I believe that from the first he spoke oftener and more
confidentially to me than to any other of the droving party There was a
something of sympathy between usI cant explain what it was It seemed
as though it were an understood thing between us that we understood each
other He sometimes said things to me which would have needed a deal of
explanationso I thoughthad he said them to any other of the party
Hed often after brooding a long while start a sentence and break off
with You know Jack And somehow I understood without being able to
explain why We had never met before I engaged with him for this trip
His men respected him but he was not a popular boss he was too gloomy
and never drank a glass nor shouted on the trip he was reckoned a
mean boss and rather a niggerdriver

He was full of Adam Lindsay Gordon the EnglishAustralian poet who
shot himself and so was I I lost an old copy of Gordons poems on the
route and the Boss overheard me inquiring about it later on he asked
me if I liked Gordon We got to it rather sheepishly at first but
byandby wed quote Gordon freely in turn when we were alone in camp
Those are grand lines about Burke and Wills the explorers arent
they Jack hed say after chewing his cud or rather the stem of his
briar for a long while without a word He had his pipe in his mouth as
often as any of us but somehow I fancied he didnt enjoy it an empty
pipe or a stick would have suited him just as well it seemed to me
Those are great lines hed say

 In Collins Street standeth a statue tall
 A statue tall on a pillar of stone
 Telling its story to great and small
 Of the dust reclaimed from the sandwaste lone

 

 Weary and wasted worn and wan
 Feeble and faint and languid and low
 He lay on the desert a dying man
 Who has gone my friends where we all must go

 Thats a grand thing Jack How does it go
 With a pistol clenched in his failing hand
 And the film of death oer his fading eyes
 He saw the sun go down on the sand

 The Boss would straighten up with a sigh that might have been half a yawn
 And he slept and never saw it rise
 speaking with a sort of quiet force all the time
 Then maybe hed stand with his back to the fire roasting his dusty leggings
 with his hands behind his back and looking out over the dusky plain

 What mattered the sand or the whitning chalk
 The blighted herbage or blackened log
 The crooked beak of the eaglehawk
 Or the hot red tongue of the native dog

They dont matter much do they Jack

Damned if I think they do Boss Id say

 The couch was rugged those sextons rude
 But in spite of a leaden shroud we know
 That the bravest and fairest are earthworms food
 Where once they have gone where we all must go

Once he repeated the poem containing the lines

 Love when we wandered here together
 Hand in hand through the sparkling weather
 God surely loved us a little then

Beautiful lines those Jack

 Then skies were fairer and shores were firmer
 And the blue sea over the white sand rolled
 Babble and prattle and prattle and murmur

How does it go Jack He stood up and turned his face to the light but
not before I had a glimpse of it I think that the saddest eyes on earth
are mostly womens eyes but Ive seen few so sad as the Bosss were
just then

It seemed strange that he a Bushman preferred Gordons sea poems to
his horsey and bushy rhymes but so he did I fancy his favourite poem
was that one of Gordons with the lines

 I would that with sleepy soft embraces
 The sea would fold me would find me rest
 In the luminous depths of its secret places
 Where the wealth of Gods marvels is manifest

He usually spoke quietly in a tone as though death were in camp but
after wed been on Gordons poetry for a while hed end it abruptly
with Well its time to turn in or Its time to turn out or hed
give me an order in connection with the cattle He had been a welltodo
squatter on the Lachlan riverside in New South Wales and had been
ruined by the drought they said One night in camp and after smoking
in silence for nearly an hour he asked

Do you know Fisher Jackthe man that owns these bullocks

Ive heard of him I said Fisher was a big squatter with stations
both in New South Wales and in Queensland

Well he came to my station on the Lachlan years ago without a penny in
his pocket or decent rag to his back or a crust in his tuckerbag and
I gave him a job Hes my boss now Ah well its the way of Australia
you know Jack

The Boss had one man who went on every droving trip with him he
was bred on the Bosss station they said and had been with him
practically all his life His name was Andy I forget his other name
if he really had one Andy had charge of the drovingplant a tilted
twohorse waggonette in which we carried the rations and horsefeed
and he did the cooking and kept accounts The Boss had no head for
figures Andy might have been twentyfive or thirtyfive or anything in
between His hair stuck up like a wellmade brush all round and his big
grey eyes also had an inquiring expression His weakness was girls or
he theirs I dont know which halfcastes not barred He was I think
the most innocent goodnatured and openhearted scamp I ever met
Towards the middle of the trip Andy spoke to me one night alone in camp
about the Boss

The Boss seems to have taken to you Jack all right

Think so I said I thought I smelt jealousy and detected a sneer

Im sure of it Its very seldom HE takes to any one

I said nothing

Then after a while Andy said suddenly

Look here Jack Im glad of it Id like to see him make a chum of
some one if only for one trip And dont you make any mistake about the
Boss Hes a white man Theres precious few that know himprecious few
now but I do and itll do him a lot of good to have some one to yarn
with And Andy said no more on the subject for that trip

The long hot dusty miles dragged by across the blazing plainsbig
clearings ratherand through the sweltering hot scrubs and we reached
Bathurst at last and then the hot dusty days and weeks and months that
wed left behind us to the Great NorthWest seemed as nothingas I
suppose life will seem when we come to the end of it

The bullocks were going by rail from Bathurst to Sydney We were all one
long afternoon getting them into the trucks and when wed finished the
boss said to me

Look here Jack youre going on to Sydney arent you

Yes Im going down to have a fly round

Well why not wait and go down with Andy in the morning Hes going
down in charge of the cattle The cattletrain starts about daylight It
wont be so comfortable as the passenger but youll save your fare and
you can give Andy a hand with the cattle Youve only got to have a
look at em every other station and poke up any that fall down in the
trucks You and Andy are mates arent you

I said it would just suit me Somehow I fancied that the Boss seemed
anxious to have my company for one more evening and to tell the truth
I felt really sorry to part with him Id had to work as hard as any
of the other chaps but I liked him and I believed he liked me Hed
struck me as a man whod been quietened down by some heavy trouble and
I felt sorry for him without knowing what the trouble was

Come and have a drink Boss I said The agent had paid us off during
the day

He turned into a hotel with me

I dont drink Jack he said but Ill take a glass with you

I didnt know you were a teetotaller Boss I said I had not been
surprised at his keeping so strictly from the drink on the trip but now
that it was over it was a different thing

Im not a teetotaller Jack he said I can take a glass or leave
it And he called for a long beer and we drank Heres luck to each
other

Well I said I wish I could take a glass or leave it And I meant
it

Then the Boss spoke as Id never heard him speak before I thought for
the moment that the one drink had affected him but I understood before
the night was over He laid his hand on my shoulder with a grip like a
man who has suddenly made up his mind to lend you five pounds Jack
he said theres worse things than drinking and theres worse things
than heavy smoking When a man who smokes gets such a load of trouble on
him that he can find no comfort in his pipe then its a heavy load
And when a man who drinks gets so deep into trouble that he can find no
comfort in liquor then its deep trouble Take my tip for it Jack

He broke off and half turned away with a jerk of his head as if
impatient with himself then presently he spoke in his usual quiet
tone

But youre only a boy yet Jack Never mind me I wont ask you to take
the second drink You dont want it and besides I know the signs

He paused leaning with both hands on the edge of the counter and
looking down between his arms at the floor He stood that way thinking
for a while then he suddenly straightened up like a man whod made up
his mind to something

I want you to come along home with me Jack he said well fix you a
shakedown

I forgot to tell you that he was married and lived in Bathurst

But wont it put Mrs Head about

Not at all Shes expecting you Come along theres nothing to see in
Bathurst and youll have plenty of knocking round in Sydney Come on
well just be in time for tea

He lived in a brick cottage on the outskirts of the townan
oldfashioned cottage with ivy and climbing roses like you see in some
of those old settled districts There was I remember the stump of a
tree in front covered with ivy till it looked like a giants club with
the thick end up

When we got to the house the Boss paused a minute with his hand on the
gate Hed been home a couple of days having ridden in ahead of the
bullocks

Jack he said I must tell you that Mrs Head had a great trouble at
one time Wewe lost our two children It does her good to talk to a
stranger now and againshes always better afterwards but theres very
few I care to bring Youyou neednt notice anything strange And agree
with her Jack You know Jack

Thats all right Boss I said Id knocked about the Bush too long
and run against too many strange characters and things to be surprised
at anything much

The door opened and he took a little woman in his arms I saw by the
light of a lamp in the room behind that the womans hair was grey and
I reckoned that he had his mother living with him Andwe do have odd
thoughts at odd times in a flashand I wondered how Mrs Head and her
motherinlaw got on together But the next minute I was in the room
and introduced to My wife Mrs Head and staring at her with both
eyes

It was his wife I dont think I can describe her For the first minute
or two coming in out of the dark and before my eyes got used to the
lamplight I had an impression as of a little old womanone of those
freshfaced wellpreserved little old ladieswho dressed young wore
false teeth and aped the giddy girl But this was because of Mrs Heads
impulsive welcome of me and her grey hair The hair was not so grey as
I thought at first seeing it with the lamplight behind it it was like
dullbrown hair lightly dusted with flour She wore it short and
it became her that way There was something aristocratic about her
faceher nose and chinI fancied and something that you couldnt
describe She had big dark eyesdarkbrown I thought though they
might have been hazel they were a bit too big and bright for me and
now and again when she got excited the white showed all round the
pupilsjust a little but a little was enough

She seemed extra glad to see me I thought at first that she was a bit
of a gusher

Oh Im so glad youve come Mr Ellis she said giving my hand a
grip WalterMr Headhas been speaking to me about you Ive been
expecting you Sit down by the fire Mr Ellis tea will be ready
presently Dont you find it a bit chilly She shivered It was a bit
chilly now at night on the Bathurst plains The table was set for tea
and set rather in swell style The cottage was too well furnished
even for a lucky boss drovers home the furniture looked as if it had
belonged to a tony homestead at one time I felt a bit strange at first
sitting down to tea and almost wished that I was having a comfortable
tuckin at a restaurant or in a pub diningroom But she knew a lot
about the Bush and chatted away and asked questions about the trip
and soon put me at my ease You see for the last year or two Id
taken my tucker in my handshunk of damper and meat and a claspknife
mostlysitting on my heel in the dust or on a log or a tuckerbox

There was a hard brown wrinkled old woman that the Heads called
Auntie She waited at the table but Mrs Head kept bustling round
herself most of the time helping us Andy came in to tea

Mrs Head bustled round like a girl of twenty instead of a woman of
thirtyseven as Andy afterwards told me she was She had the figure and
movements of a girl and the impulsiveness and expression tooa womanly
girl but sometimes I fancied there was something very childish about
her face and talk After tea she and the Boss sat on one side of the
fire and Andy and I on the otherAndy a little behind me at the corner
of the table

WalterMr Headtells me youve been out on the Lachlan river Mr
Ellis she said as soon as shed settled down and she leaned forward
as if eager to hear that Id been there

Yes Mrs Head Ive knocked round all about out there

She sat up straight and put the tips of her fingers to the side of her
forehead and knitted her brows This was a trick she hadshe often did
it during the evening And when she did that she seemed to forget what
shed said last

She smoothed her forehead and clasped her hands in her lap

Oh Im so glad to meet somebody from the back country Mr Ellis
she said Walter so seldom brings a stranger here and I get tired of
talking to the same people about the same things and seeing the same
faces You dont know what a relief it is Mr Ellis to see a new face
and talk to a stranger

I can quite understand that Mrs Head I said And so I could I never
stayed more than three months in one place if I could help it

She looked into the fire and seemed to try to think The Boss
straightened up and stroked her head with his big sunbrowned hand and
then put his arm round her shoulders This brought her back

You know we had a station out on the Lachlan Mr Ellis Did Walter ever
tell you about the time we lived there

No I said glancing at the Boss I know you had a station there
but you know the Boss doesnt talk much

Tell Jack Maggie said the Boss I dont mind

She smiled You know Walter Mr Ellis she said You wont mind him
He doesnt like me to talk about the children he thinks it upsets me
but thats foolish it always relieves me to talk to a stranger She
leaned forward eagerly it seemed and went on quickly Ive been
wanting to tell you about the children ever since Walter spoke to me
about you I knew you would understand directly I saw your face These
town people dont understand I like to talk to a Bushman You know we
lost our children out on the station The fairies took them Did Walter
ever tell you about the fairies taking the children away

This was a facer II beg pardon I commenced when Andy gave me a
dig in the back Then I saw it all

No Mrs Head The Boss didnt tell me about that

You surely know about the Bush Fairies Mr Ellis she said her big
eyes fixed on my facethe Bush Fairies that look after the little ones
that are lost in the Bush and take them away from the Bush if they are
not found Youve surely heard of them Mr Ellis Most Bushmen have that
Ive spoken to Maybe youve seen them Andy there has Andy gave me
another dig

Of course Ive heard of them Mrs Head I said but I cant swear
that Ive seen one

Andy has Havent you Andy

Of course I have Mrs Head Didnt I tell you all about it the last
time we were home

And didnt you ever tell Mr Ellis Andy

Of course he did I said coming to Andys rescue I remember it now
You told me that night we camped on the Bogan river Andy

Of course said Andy

Did he tell you about finding a lost child and the fairy with it

Yes said Andy I told him all about that

And the fairy was just going to take the child away when Andy found it
and when the fairy saw Andy she flew away

Yes I said thats what Andy told me

And what did you say the fairy was like Andy asked Mrs Head fixing
her eyes on his face

Like It was like one of them angels you see in Bible pictures Mrs
Head said Andy promptly sitting bolt upright and keeping his big
innocent grey eyes fixed on hers lest she might think he was telling
lies It was just like the angel in that Christinthestable picture
we had at home on the stationthe righthand one in blue

She smiled You couldnt call it an idiotic smile nor the foolish
smile you see sometimes in melancholy mad people It was more of a happy
childish smile

I was so foolish at first and gave poor Walter and the doctors a lot
of trouble she said Of course it never struck me until afterwards
that the fairies had taken the children

She pressed the tips of the fingers of both hands to her forehead and
sat so for a while then she roused herself again

But what am I thinking about I havent started to tell you about the
children at all yet Auntie bring the childrens portraits will you
please Youll find them on my dressingtable

The old woman seemed to hesitate

Go on Auntie and do what I ask you said Mrs Head Dont be
foolish You know Im all right now

You mustnt take any notice of Auntie Mr Ellis she said with a
smile while the old womans back was turned Poor old body shes a
bit crotchety at times as old women are She doesnt like me to get
talking about the children Shes got an idea that if I do Ill start
talking nonsense as I used to do the first year after the children were
lost I was very foolish then wasnt I Walter

You were Maggie said the Boss But thats all past You mustnt
think of that time any more

You see said Mrs Head in explanation to me at first nothing would
drive it out of my head that the children had wandered about until they
perished of hunger and thirst in the Bush As if the Bush Fairies would
let them do that

You were very foolish Maggie said the Boss but dont think about
that

The old woman brought the portraits a little boy and a little girl
they must have been very pretty children

You see said Mrs Head taking the portraits eagerly and giving them
to me one by one we had these taken in Sydney some years before the
children were lost they were much younger then Wallys is not a good
portrait he was teething then and very thin Thats him standing on
the chair Isnt the pose good See hes got one hand and one little
foot forward and an eager look in his eyes The portrait is very dark
and youve got to look close to see the foot He wants a toy rabbit that
the photographer is tossing up to make him laugh In the next portrait
hes sitting on the chairhes just settled himself to enjoy the fun
But see how happy little Maggie looks You can see my arm where I was
holding her in the chair She was six months old then and little Wally
had just turned two

She put the portraits up on the mantelshelf

Let me see Wally thats little Walter you knowWally was five and
little Maggie three and a half when we lost them Werent they Walter

Yes Maggie said the Boss

You were away Walter when it happened

Yes Maggie said the Bosscheerfully it seemed to meI was away

And we couldnt find you Walter You see she said to me WalterMr
Headwas away in Sydney on business and we couldnt find his address
It was a beautiful morning though rather warm and just after the
breakup of the drought The grass was kneehigh all over the run It
was a lonely place there wasnt much bush cleared round the homestead
just a hundred yards or so and the great awful scrubs ran back from the
edges of the clearing all round for miles and milesfifty or a hundred
miles in some directions without a break didnt they Walter

Yes Maggie

I was alone at the house except for Mary a halfcaste girl we had who
used to help me with the housework and the children Andy was out on the
run with the men mustering sheep werent you Andy

Yes Mrs Head

I used to watch the children close as they got to run about because
if they once got into the edge of the scrub theyd be lost but this
morning little Wally begged hard to be let take his little sister down
under a clump of bluegums in a corner of the home paddock to gather
buttercups You remember that clump of gums Walter

I remember Maggie

I wont go through the fence a step mumma little Wally said I
could see Old Peteran old shepherd and stationhand we hadI could
see him working on a dam we were making across a creek that ran down
there You remember Old Peter Walter

Of course I do Maggie

I knew that Old Peter would keep an eye to the children so I told
little Wally to keep tight hold of his sisters hand and go straight
down to Old Peter and tell him I sent them

She was leaning forward with her hands clasping her knee and telling me
all this with a strange sort of eagerness

The little ones toddled off hand in hand with their other hands
holding fast their straw hats In case a bad wind blowed as little
Maggie said I saw them stoop under the first fence and that was the
last that any one saw of them

Except the fairies Maggie said the Boss quickly

Of course Walter except the fairies

She pressed her fingers to her temples again for a minute

It seems that Old Peter was going to ride out to the musterers camp
that morning with bread for the men and he left his work at the dam
and started into the Bush after his horse just as I turned back into the
house and before the children got near him They either followed
him for some distance or wandered into the Bush after flowers or
butterflies She broke off and then suddenly asked me Do you
think the Bush Fairies would entice children away Mr Ellis

The Boss caught my eye and frowned and shook his head slightly

No Im sure they wouldnt Mrs Head I saidat least not from what
I know of them

She thought or tried to think again for a while in her helpless
puzzled way Then she went on speaking rapidly and rather
mechanically it seemed to me

The first I knew of it was when Peter came to the house about an hour
afterwards leading his horse and without the children I saidI
said O my God wheres the children Her fingers fluttered up to her
temples

Dont mind about that Maggie said the Boss hurriedly stroking her
head Tell Jack about the fairies

You were away at the time Walter

Yes Maggie

And we couldnt find you Walter

No Maggie very gently He rested his elbow on his knee and his chin
on his hand and looked into the fire

It wasnt your fault Walter but if you had been at home do you think
the fairies would have taken the children

Of course they would Maggie They had to the children were lost

And theyre bringing the children home next year

Yes Maggienext year

She lifted her hands to her head in a startled way and it was some time
before she went on again There was no need to tell me about the lost
children I could see it all She and the halfcaste rushing towards
where the children were seen last with Old Peter after them The
hurried search in the nearer scrub The mother calling all the time
for Maggie and Wally and growing wilder as the minutes flew past Old
Peters ride to the musterers camp Horsemen seeming to turn up in no
time and from nowhere as they do in a case like this and no matter
how lonely the district Bushmen galloping through the scrub in all
directions The hurried search the first day and the mother mad with
anxiety as night came on Her long hopeless wildeyed watch through
the night starting up at every sound of a horses hoof and reading
the worst in one glance at the riders face The systematic work of the
searchparties next day and the days following How those days do fly
past The women from the next run or selection and some from the town
driving from ten or twenty miles perhaps to stay with and try to
comfort the mother Put the horse to the cart Jim I must go to that
poor woman Comforting her with improbable stories of children who had
been lost for days and were none the worse for it when they were
found The mounted policemen out with the black trackers Searchparties
cooeeing to each other about the Bush and lighting signalfires The
reckless breakneck rides for news or more help And the Boss himself
wildeyed and haggard riding about the Bush with Andy and one or two
others perhaps and searching hopelessly days after the rest had given
up all hope of finding the children alive All this passed before me as
Mrs Head talked her voice sounding the while as if she were in another
room and when I roused myself to listen she was on to the fairies
again

It was very foolish of me Mr Ellis Weeks aftermonths after I
thinkId insist on going out on the verandah at dusk and calling for
the children Id stand there and call Maggie and Wally until
Walter took me inside sometimes he had to force me inside Poor Walter
But of course I didnt know about the fairies then Mr Ellis I was
really out of my mind for a time

No wonder you were Mrs Head I said It was terrible trouble

Yes and I made it worse I was so selfish in my trouble But its all
right now Walter she said rumpling the Bosss hair Ill never be
so foolish again

Of course you wont Maggie

Were very happy now arent we Walter

Of course we are Maggie

And the children are coming back next year

Next year Maggie

He leaned over the fire and stirred it up

You mustnt take any notice of us Mr Ellis she went on Poor Walter
is away so much that Im afraid I make a little too much of him when he
does come home

She paused and pressed her fingers to her temples again Then she said
quickly

They used to tell me that it was all nonsense about the fairies but
they were no friends of mine I shouldnt have listened to them Walter
You told me not to But then I was really not in my right mind

Who used to tell you that Mrs Head I asked

The Voices she said you know about the Voices Walter

Yes Maggie But you dont hear the Voices now Maggie he asked
anxiously You havent heard them since Ive been away this time have
you Maggie

No Walter Theyve gone away a long time I hear voices now sometimes
but theyre the Bush Fairies voices I hear them calling Maggie and
Wally to come with them She paused again And sometimes I think I
hear them call me But of course I couldnt go away without you Walter
But Im foolish again I was going to ask you about the other voices Mr
Ellis They used to say that it was madness about the fairies but then
if the fairies hadnt taken the children Black Jimmy or the black
trackers with the police could have tracked and found them at once

Of course they could Mrs Head I said

They said that the trackers couldnt track them because there was rain
a few hours after the children were lost But that was ridiculous It
was only a thunderstorm

Why I said Ive known the blacks to track a man after a weeks
heavy rain

She had her head between her fingers again and when she looked up it
was in a scared way

Oh Walter she said clutching the Bosss arm whatever have I been
talking about What must Mr Ellis think of me Oh why did you let me
talk like that

He put his arm round her Andy nudged me and got up

Where are you going Mr Ellis she asked hurriedly Youre not going
tonight Aunties made a bed for you in Andys room You mustnt mind
me

Jack and Andy are going out for a little while said the Boss
Theyll be in to supper Well have a yarn Maggie

Be sure you come back to supper Mr Ellis she said I really dont
know what you must think of meIve been talking all the time

Oh Ive enjoyed myself Mrs Head I said and Andy hooked me out

Shell have a good cry and be better now said Andy when we got away
from the house She might be better for months She has been fairly
reasonable for over a year but the Boss found her pretty bad when he
came back this time It upset him a lot I can tell you She has turns
now and again and always ends up like she did just now She gets a
longing to talk about it to a Bushman and a stranger it seems to do her
good The doctors against it but doctors dont know everything

Its all true about the children then I asked

Its cruel true said Andy

And were the bodies never found

Yes then after a long pause I found them

You did

Yes in the scrub and not so very far from home eitherand in a
fairly clear space Its a wonder the searchparties missed it but it
often happens that way Perhaps the little ones wandered a long way and
came round in a circle I found them about two months after they were
lost They had to be found if only for the Bosss sake You see in
a case like this and when the bodies arent found the parents never
quite lose the idea that the little ones are wandering about the Bush
tonight it might be years after and perishing from hunger thirst
or cold That mad idea haunts em all their lives Its the same I
believe with friends drowned at sea Friends ashore are haunted for a
long while with the idea of the white sodden corpse tossing about and
drifting round in the water

And you never told Mrs Head about the children being found

Not for a long time It wouldnt have done any good She was raving
mad for months He took her to Sydney and then to Melbourneto the best
doctors he could find in Australia They could do no good so he sold
the stationsacrificed everything and took her to England

To England

Yes and then to Germany to a big German doctor there Hed offer a
thousand pounds where they only wanted fifty It was no good She
got worse in England and raved to go back to Australia and find the
children The doctors advised him to take her back and he did He spent
all his money travelling saloon and with reserved cabins and a
nurse and trying to get her cured thats why hes droving now She was
restless in Sydney She wanted to go back to the station and wait there
till the fairies brought the children home Shed been getting the fairy
idea into her head slowly all the time The Boss encouraged it But the
station was sold and he couldnt have lived there anyway without going
mad himself Hed married her from Bathurst Both of them have got
friends and relations here so he thought best to bring her here He
persuaded her that the fairies were going to bring the children here
Everybodys very kind to them I think its a mistake to run away from a
town where youre known in a case like this though most people do it
It was years before he gave up hope I think he has hopes yetafter
shes been fairly well for a longish time

And you never tried telling her that the children were found

Yes the Boss did The little ones were buried on the Lachlan river at
first but the Boss got a horror of having them buried in the Bush so
he had them brought to Sydney and buried in the Waverley Cemetery near
the sea He bought the ground and room for himself and Maggie when they
go out Its all the ground he owns in wide Australia and once he had
thousands of acres He took her to the grave one day The doctors were
against it but he couldnt rest till he tried it He took her out and
explained it all to her She scarcely seemed interested She read the
names on the stone and said it was a nice stone and asked questions
about how the children were found and brought here She seemed quite
sensible and very cool about it But when he got her home she was back
on the fairy idea again He tried another day but it was no use so
then he let it be I think its better as it is Now and again at her
best she seems to understand that the children were found dead and
buried and shell talk sensibly about it and ask questions in a quiet
way and make him promise to take her to Sydney to see the grave
next time hes down But it doesnt last long and shes always worse
afterwards

We turned into a bar and had a beer It was a very quiet drink Andy
shouted in his turn and while I was drinking the second beer a
thought struck me

The Boss was away when the children were lost

Yes said Andy

Strange you couldnt find him

Yes it was strange but HELL have to tell you about that Very likely
he will its either all or nothing with him

I feel damned sorry for the Boss I said

Youd be sorrier if you knew all said Andy Its the worst trouble
that can happen to a man Its like living with the dead Itsits
like a man living with his dead wife

When we went home supper was ready We found Mrs Head bright and
cheerful bustling round Youd have thought her one of the happiest and
brightest little women in Australia Not a word about children or the
fairies She knew the Bush and asked me all about my trips She told
some good Bush stories too It was the pleasantest hour Id spent for a
long time

Good night Mr Ellis she said brightly shaking hands with me when
Andy and I were going to turn in And dont forget your pipe Here it
is I know that Bushmen like to have a whiff or two when they turn
in Walter smokes in bed I dont mind You can smoke all night if you
like

She seems all right I said to Andy when we were in our room

He shook his head mournfully Wed left the door ajar and we could hear
the Boss talking to her quietly Then we heard her speak she had a very
clear voice

Yes Ill tell you the truth Walter Ive been deceiving you Walter
all the time but I did it for the best Dont be angry with me Walter
The Voices did come back while you were away Oh how I longed for you
to come back They havent come since youve been home Walter You
must stay with me a while now Those awful Voices kept calling me and
telling me lies about the children Walter They told me to kill myself
they told me it was all my own faultthat I killed the children They
said I was a drag on you and theyd laughHa ha halike that
Theyd say Come on Maggie come on Maggie They told me to come to
the river Walter

Andy closed the door His face was very miserable

We turned in and I can tell you I enjoyed a soft white bed after months
and months of sleeping out at night between watches on the hard ground
or the sand or at best on a few boughs when I wasnt too tired to pull
them down and my saddle for a pillow

But the story of the children haunted me for an hour or two Ive never
since quite made up my mind as to why the Boss took me home Probably
he really did think it would do his wife good to talk to a stranger
perhaps he wanted me to understandmaybe he was weakening as he grew
older and craved for a new word or handgrip of sympathy now and then

When I did get to sleep I could have slept for three or four days but
Andy roused me out about four oclock The old woman that they called
Auntie was up and had a good breakfast of eggs and bacon and coffee
ready in the detached kitchen at the back We moved about on tiptoe and
had our breakfast quietly

The wife made me promise to wake her to see to our breakfast and say
Goodbye to you but I want her to sleep this morning Jack said the
Boss Im going to walk down as far as the station with you She made
up a parcel of fruit and sandwiches for you and Andy Dont forget it

Andy went on ahead The Boss and I walked down the wide silent street
which was also the main road and we walked two or three hundred yards
without speaking He didnt seem sociable this morning or any way
sentimental when he did speak it was something about the cattle

But I had to speak I felt a swelling and rising up in my chest and at
last I made a swallow and blurted out

Look here Boss old chap Im damned sorry

Our hands came together and gripped The ghostly Australian daybreak was
over the Bathurst plains

We went on another hundred yards or so and then the Boss said quietly

I was away when the children were lost Jack I used to go on a howling
spree every six or nine months Maggie never knew Id tell her I had to
go to Sydney on business or OutBack to look after some stock When
the children were lost and for nearly a fortnight after I was beastly
drunk in an outoftheway shanty in the Busha sly grogshop The old
brute that kept it was too true to me He thought that the story of the
lost children was a trick to get me home and he swore that he hadnt
seen me He never told me I could have found those children Jack They
were mostly new chums and fools about the run and not one of the three
policemen was a Bushman I knew those scrubs better than any man in the
country

I reached for his hand again and gave it a grip That was all I could
do for him

Goodbye Jack he said at the door of the brakevan Goodbye
Andykeep those bullocks on their feet

The cattletrain went on towards the Blue Mountains Andy and I sat
silent for a while watching the guard fry three eggs on a plate over a
coalstove in the centre of the van

Does the boss never go to Sydney I asked

Very seldom said Andy and then only when he has to on business
When he finishes his business with the stock agents he takes a run out
to Waverley Cemetery perhaps and comes home by the next train

After a while I said He told me about the drink Andyabout his being
on the spree when the children were lost

Well Jack said Andy thats the thing thats been killing him ever
since and it happened over ten years ago




A Bush Dance



Tap tap tap tap

The little schoolhouse and residence in the scrub was lighted brightly
in the midst of the close solid blackness of that moonless December
night when the sky and stars were smothered and suffocated by drought
haze

It was the evening of the school childrens Feast That is to say that
the children had been sent and let go and the younger ones fetched
through the blazing heat to the school one day early in the holidays
and racedsometimes in couples tied together by the legsand caked
and bunned and finally improved upon by the local Chadband and got
rid of The schoolroom had been cleared for dancing the maps rolled and
tied the desks and blackboards stacked against the wall outside Tea
was over and the trestles and boards whereon had been spread better
things than had been provided for the unfortunate youngsters had been
taken outside to keep the desks and blackboards company

On stools running end to end along one side of the room sat about twenty
more or less blooming country girls of from fifteen to twenty odd

On the rest of the stools running end to end along the other wall sat
about twenty more or less blooming chaps

It was evident that something was seriously wrong None of the girls
spoke above a hushed whisper None of the men spoke above a hushed oath
Now and again two or three sidled out and if you had followed them you
would have found that they went outside to listen hard into the darkness
and to swear

Tap tap tap

The rows moved uneasily and some of the girls turned pale faces
nervously towards the sidedoor in the direction of the sound

Taptap

The tapping came from the kitchen at the rear of the teachers
residence and was uncomfortably suggestive of a coffin being made it
was also accompanied by a sickly indescribable odourmore like that of
warm cheap glue than anything else

In the schoolroom was a painful scene of strained listening Whenever
one of the men returned from outside or put his head in at the door
all eyes were fastened on him in the flash of a single eye and then
withdrawn hopelessly At the sound of a horses step all eyes and ears
were on the door till some one muttered Its only the horses in the
paddock

Some of the girls eyes began to glisten suspiciously and at last the
belle of the partya great darkhaired pinkandwhite Blue Mountain
girl who had been sitting for a full minute staring before her with
blue eyes unnaturally bright suddenly covered her face with her hands
rose and started blindly from the room from which she was steered in
a hurry by two sympathetic and rather upset girl friends and as she
passed out she was heard sobbing hysterically

Oh I cant help it I did want to dance Its a shshame I cant help
it II want to dance I rode twenty miles to danceandand I want to
dance

A tall strapping young Bushman rose without disguise and followed the
girl out The rest began to talk loudly of stock dogs and horses and
other Bush things but above their voices rang out that of the girl from
the outsidebeing man comforted

I cant help it Jack I did want to dance II had suchsucha
jobto get motherandand father to let me comeandand now

The two girl friends came back He sez to leave her to him they
whispered in reply to an interrogatory glance from the schoolmistress

Itsits no use Jack came the voice of grief You dont know
whatwhat father and motheris II wontbe ableto geget
awayagainforfornot till Im married perhaps

The schoolmistress glanced uneasily along the row of girls Ill take
her into my room and make her lie down she whispered to her sister
who was staying with her Shell start some of the other girls
presentlyits just the weather for it and she passed out quietly
That schoolmistress was a woman of penetration

A final taptap from the kitchen then a sound like the squawk of a
hurt or frightened child and the faces in the room turned quickly in
that direction and brightened But there came a bang and a sound like
damn and hopelessness settled down

A shout from the outer darkness and most of the men and some of the
girls rose and hurried out Fragments of conversation heard in the
darkness

Its two horses I tell you

Its three you

Lay you

Put the stuff up

A clack of gate thrown open

Who is it Tom

Voices from gatewards yelling Johnny Mears Theyve got Johnny
Mears

Then rose yells and a cheer such as is seldom heard in scrublands

Out in the kitchen long Dave Regan grabbed from the far side of the
table where he had thrown it a burst and battered concertina which
he had been for the last hour vainly trying to patch and make airtight
and holding it out towards the backdoor between his palms as a
football is held he let it drop and fetched it neatly on the toe of
his ridingboot It was a beautiful kick the concertina shot out into
the blackness from which was projected in return first a short
sudden howl then a face with one eye glaring and the other covered by
an enormous brickcoloured hand and a voice that wanted to know who
shot that lurid loaf of bread

But from the schoolroom was heard the loud free voice of Joe Matthews
MC

Take yer partners Hurry up Take yer partners Theyve got Johnny
Mears with his fiddle




The BuckJumper

Saturday afternoon

There were about a dozen Bush natives from anywhere most of them lanky
and easygoing hanging about the little slabandbark hotel on the
edge of the scrub at Capertee Camp a teamsters camp when Cob  Cos
mailcoach and six came dashing down the siding from round Crown Ridge
in all its glory to the end of the twelvemile stage Some wiry
illused hacks were hanging to the fence and to saplings about the
place The fresh coachhorses stood ready in a stockyard close to the
shanty As the coach climbed the nearer bank of the creek at the foot of
the ridge six of the Bushmen detached themselves from verandah posts
from their heels from the clay floor of the verandah and the rough slab
wall against which theyd been resting and joined a group of four or
five who stood round one He stood with his back to the corner post
of the stockyard his feet well braced out in front of him and
contemplated the toes of his tight new lasticside boots and whistled
softly He was a cleanlimbed handsome fellow with ridingcords
leggings and a blue sash he was GraecoRomannosed blueeyed and
his glossy curly black hair bunched up in front of the brim of a new
cabbagetree hat set well back on his head

Do it for a quid Jack asked one

Damned if I will Jim said the young man at the post Ill do it for
a fivernot a blanky sprat less

Jim took off his hat and shoved it round and bobs were chucked
into it The result was about thirty shillings

Jack glanced contemptuously into the crown of the hat

Not me he said showing some emotion for the first time Dyer think
Im going to risk me blanky neck for your blanky amusement for thirty
blanky bob Ill ride the blanky horse for a fiver and Ill feel the
blanky quids in my pocket before I get on

Meanwhile the coach had dashed up to the door of the shanty There
were about twenty passengers aboardinside on the boxseat on the
tailboard and hanging on to the roofmost of them Sydney men going up
to the Mudgee races They got down and went inside with the driver for
a drink while the stablemen changed horses The Bushmen raised their
voices a little and argued

One of the passengers was a big stout hearty mana goodhearted
sporting man and a racehorseowner according to his brands He had
a round red face and a white cork hat Whats those chaps got on
outside he asked the publican

Oh its a bet theyve got on about riding a horse replied the
publican The flashlooking chap with the sash is Flash Jack the
horsebreaker and they reckon theyve got the champion outlaw in the
district out therethat chestnut horse in the yard

The sporting man was interested at once and went out and joined the
Bushmen

Well chaps what have you got on here he asked cheerily

Oh said Jim carelessly its only a bit of a bet about ridin
that blanky chestnut in the corner of the yard there He indicated an
ungroomed chestnut horse fenced off by a couple of long sapling poles
in a corner of the stockyard Flash Jack therehe reckons hes the
champion horsebreaker round hereFlash Jack reckons he can take it out
of that horse first try

Whats up with the horse inquired the big redfaced man It looks
quiet enough Why Id ride it myself

Would yer said Jim who had hair that stood straight up and an
innocent inquiring expression Looks quiet does he YOU ought to know
more about horses than to go by the looks of em Hes quiet enough just
now when theres no one near him but you should have been here an
hour ago That horse has killed two men and put another chaps shoulder
outbesides breaking a coves leg It took six of us all the morning to
run him in and get the saddle on him and now Flash Jack wants to back
out of it

Euraliar remarked Flash Jack cheerfully I said Id ride that blanky
horse out of the yard for a fiver I aint goin to risk my blanky neck
for nothing and only to amuse you blanks

He said hed ride the horse inside the yard for a quid said Jim

And get smashed against the rails said Flash Jack I would be a
fool Id rather take my chance outside in the scruband its rough
country round here

Well how much do you want asked the man in the mushroom hat

A fiver I said replied Jack indifferently And the blanky stuff in
my pocket before I get on the blanky horse

Are you frightened of us running away without paying you inquired one
of the passengers who had gathered round

Im frightened of the horse bolting with me without me being paid
said Flash Jack I know that horse hes got a mouth like iron I might
be at the bottom of the cliff on Crown Ridge road in twenty minutes with
my head caved in and then what chance for the quids

You wouldnt want em then suggested a passenger Or saywed
leave the fiver with the publican to bury you

Flash Jack ignored that passenger He eyed his boots and softly whistled
a tune

All right said the man in the cork hat putting his hand in his
pocket Ill start with a quid stump up you chaps

The five pounds were got together

Ill lay a quid to half a quid he dont stick on ten minutes shouted
Jim to his mates as soon as he saw that the event was to come off The
passengers also betted amongst themselves Flash Jack after putting the
money in his breechespocket let down the rails and led the horse into
the middle of the yard

Quiet as an old cow snorted a passenger in disgust I believe its a
sell

Wait a bit said Jim to the passenger wait a bit and youll see

They waited and saw

Flash Jack leisurely mounted the horse rode slowly out of the yard and
trotted briskly round the corner of the shanty and into the scrub which
swallowed him more completely than the sea might have done

Most of the other Bushmen mounted their horses and followed Flash Jack
to a clearing in the scrub at a safe distance from the shanty then
they dismounted and hung on to saplings or leaned against their horses
while they laughed

At the hotel there was just time for another drink The driver climbed
to his seat and shouted All aboard in his usual tone The passengers
climbed to their places thinking hard A mile or so along the road the
man with the cork hat remarked with much truth

Those blanky Bushmen have got too much time to think

 

The Bushmen returned to the shanty as soon as the coach was out of
sight and proceeded to knock down the fiver




Jimmy Grimshaws Wooing


The Halfway House at Tinned Dog OutBack in Australia kept Daniel
Myerslicensed to retail spirituous and fermented liquorsin drink and
the horrors for upward of five years at the end of which time he lay
hidden for weeks in a back skillion an object which no decent man would
care to seeor hear when it gave forth sound Good accommodation
for man and beast but few shanties save his own might for a
consideration have accommodated the sort of beast which the man Myers
had become towards the end of his career But at last the eccentric Bush
doctor Doc Wild who perhaps could drink as much as Myers without
its having any further effect upon his temperament than to keep him
awake and cynical pronounced the publican dead enough to be buried
legally so the widow buried him had the skillion cleaned out and the
sign altered to read Margaret Myers licensed c and continued to
conduct the pub just as she had run it for over five years with the
joyful and blessed exception that there was no longer a human pig and
pigstye attached and that the atmosphere was calm Most of the regular
patrons of the Halfway House could have their horrors decently and
comparatively quietlyor otherwise have them privatelyin the Big
Scrub adjacent but Myers had not been one of that sort

Mrs Myers settled herself to enjoy life comfortably and happily at
the fixed age of thirtynine for the next seven years or so She was
a pleasantfaced dumpling who had been baked solid in the droughts of
OutBack without losing her good looks and had put up with a hard life
and Myers all those years without losing her good humour and nature
Probably had her husband been the opposite kind of man she would have
been differenthaggard badtempered and altogether impossiblefor
of such is woman But then it might be taken into consideration that she
had been practically a widow during at least the last five years of her
husbands alleged life

Mrs Myers was reckoned a good catch in the district but it soon seemed
that she was not to be caught

It would be a grand thing one of the periodical boozers of Tinned Dog
would say to his mates for one of us to have his name up on a pub it
would save a lot of money

It wouldnt save you anything Bill if I got it was the retort You
neednt come round chewing my lug then Id give you one drink and no
more

The publican at Dead Camel station managers professional shearers
even one or two solvent squatters and promising cockatoos tried their
luck in vain In answer to the suggestion that she ought to have a man
to knock round and look after things she retorted that she had had one
and was perfectly satisfied Few travlers on those tracks but tried
a bit of bearup in that direction but all to no purpose Chequemen
knocked down their cheques manfully at the Halfway Houseto get
courage and goodwill and put it off till at the last moment they
offered themselves abjectly to the landlady which was worse than bad
judgment on their partit was very silly and she told them so

One or two swore off and swore to keep straight but she had no faith
in them and when they found that out it hurt their feelings so much
that they broke out and went on recordbreaking sprees

About the end of each shearing the sign was touched up with an extra
coat of paint on the Margaret whereat suitors looked hopeless

One or two of the rejected died of love in the horrors in the Big
Scrubanyway the verdict was that they died of love aggravated by the
horrors But the climax was reached when a Queensland shearer seizing
the opportunity when the mate whose turn it was to watch him fell
asleep went down to the yard and hanged himself on the butchers
gallowshaving first removed his clothes with some drinklurid idea of
leaving the world as naked as he came into it He climbed the pole sat
astride on top fixed the rope to neck and bar but gave a yella yell
of drunken triumphbefore he dropped and woke his mates

They cut him down and brought him to Next day he apologised to Mrs
Myers said Ah well So long to the rest and departedcured of
drink and love apparently The verdict was that the blanky fool should
have dropped before he yelled but she was upset and annoyed and it
began to look as though if she wished to continue to live on happily
and comfortably for a few years longer at the fixed age of thirtynine
she would either have to give up the pub or get married

Her fame was carried far and wide and she became a woman whose name was
mentioned with respect in rough shearingsheds and huts and round the
campfire

About thirty miles south of Tinned Dog one James Grimshaw
widowerotherwise known as Old Jimmy though he was little past
middle agehad a small selection which he had worked let given up
and tackled afresh with sinews of war drawn from fencing contracts
ever since the death of his young wife some fifteen years agone He was
a practical squarefaced cleanshaven clean and tidy man with a
certain cleanness about the shape of his limbs which suggested the
old jockey or hostler There were two strong theories in connection with
Jimmyone was that he had had a university education and the other
that he couldnt write his own name Not nearly such a ridiculous nor
simple case OutBack as it might seem

Jimmy smoked and listened without comment to the heard tells in
connection with Mrs Myers till at last one night at the end of his
contract and over a last pipe he said quietly Ill go up to Tinned
Dog next week and try my luck

His mates and the casual Jims and Bills were taken too suddenly to
laugh and the laugh having been lost as Bland Holt the Australian
actor would put it in a professional sense the audience had time to
think with the result that the joker swung his hand down through an
imaginary table and exclaimed

By God Jimmyll do it Applause

 

So one drowsy afternoon at the time of the year when the breathless day
runs on past 7 PM Mrs Myers sat sewing in the bar parlour when a
cleanshaved cleanshirted cleanneckerchiefed cleanmoleskinned
greasedblucheredaltogether a model or stage swagman came up was
served in the bar by the halfcaste female cook and took his way to the
riverbank where he rigged a small tent and made a model camp

A couple of hours later he sat on a stool on the verandah smoking a
clean clay pipe Just before the sunset meal Mrs Myers asked Is that
travler there yet Mary

Yes missus Clean pfellar that

The landlady knitted her forehead over her sewing as women do when
limited for stuff or wondering whether a section has been cut
wrongor perhaps she thought of that other who hadnt been a clean
pfellar She put her work aside and stood in the doorway looking out
across the clearing

Goodday mister she said seeming to become aware of him for the
first time

Goodday missus

Hot

Hot

Pause

Travlin

No not particular

She waited for him to explain Myers was always explaining when he
wasnt raving But the swagman smoked on

Have a drink she suggested to keep her end up

No thank you missus I had one an hour or so ago I never take more
than two adayone before breakfast if I can get it and a nightcap

What a contrast to Myers she thought

Come and have some tea its ready

Thank you I dont mind if I do

They got on very slowly but comfortably She got little out of him
except the facts that he had a selection had finished a contract
and was just having a look at the country He politely declined a
shakedown saying he had a comfortable camp and preferred being out
this weather She got his name with a bytheway as he rose to leave
and he went back to camp

He caught a cod and they had it for breakfast next morning and
got along so comfortable over breakfast that he put in the forenoon
pottering about the gates and stable with a hammer a saw and a box of
nails

And wellto make it shortwhen the big Tinned Dog shed had cutout
and the shearers struck the Halfway House they were greatly impressed
by a brandnew sign whereon glistened the words

 HALFWAY HOUSE HOTEL
 BY
 JAMES GRIMSHAW
 Good Stabling

The last time I saw Mrs Grimshaw she looked about thirtyfive




At Dead Dingo


It was blazing hot outside and smothering hot inside the weatherboard
and iron shanty at Dead Dingo a place on the Cleared Road where
there was a pub and a policestation and which was sometimes called
Roasted and other times Potted Dingonicknames suggested by the
everlasting drought and the vicinity of the onepub township of Tinned
Dog

From the front verandah the scene was straightcleared road running
right and left to OutBack and to Bourke and ankledeep in the red
sand dust for perhaps a hundred miles the rest bluegrey bush dust
and the heatwave blazing across every object

There were only four in the barroom though it was New Years Day
There werent many more in the county The girl sat behind the barthe
coolest place in the shantyreading Deadwood Dick On a worn and torn
and battered horsehair sofa which had seen cooler places and better
days lay an awful and healthy example a bearded swagman with his arms
twisted over his head and his face to the wall sleeping off the death
of the dead drunk Bill and Jimshearer and rouseaboutsat at a table
playing cards It was about three oclock in the afternoon and they had
been gambling since nineand the greater part of the night beforeso
they were probably in a worse condition morally and perhaps
physically than the drunken swagman on the sofa

Close under the bar in a dangerous place for his legs and tail lay a
sheepdog with a chain attached to his collar and wound round his neck

Presently a thump on the table and Bill unlucky gambler rose with an
oath that would have been savage if it hadnt been drawled

Stumped inquired Jim

Not a blanky lurid deener drawled Bill

Jim drew his reluctant hands from the cards his eyes went slowly and
hopelessly round the room and out the door There was something in the
eyes of both except when on the cardtable of the look of a man waking
in a strange place

Got anything asked Jim fingering the cards again

Bill sucked in his cheeks collecting the saliva with difficulty and
spat out on to the verandah floor

Thats all I got he drawled Its gone now

Jim leaned back in his chair twisted yawned and caught sight of the
dog

That there dog yours he asked brightening

They had evidently been strangers the day before or as strange to each
other as Bushmen can be

Bill scratched behind his ear and blinked at the dog The dog woke
suddenly to a flea fact

Yes drawled Bill hes mine

Well Im going OutBack and I want a dog said Jim gathering the
cards briskly Half a quid agin the dog

Half a quid be drawled Bill Call it a quid

Half a blanky quid

A gory lurid quid drawled Bill desperately and he stooped over his
swag

But Jims hands were itching in a ghastly way over the cards

Alright Call it a quid

The drunkard on the sofa stirred showed signs of waking but died
again Remember this it might come in useful

Bill sat down to the table once more

Jim rose first winner of the dog He stretched yawned Ah well and
shouted drinks Then he shouldered his swag stirred the dog up with his
foot unwound the chain said Ah wellso long and drifted out and
along the road toward OutBack the dog following with head and tail
down

Bill scored another drink on account of girlpity for bad luck
shouldered his swag said So long Mary and drifted out and along
the road towards Tinned Dog on the Bourke side

 

A long drowsy half hour passedthe sort of half hour that is as long
as an hour in the places where days are as long as years and years hold
about as much as days do in other places

The man on the sofa woke with a start and looked scared and wild for a
moment then he brought his dusty broken boots to the floor rested his
elbows on his knees took his unfortunate head between his hands and
came back to life gradually

He lifted his head looked at the girl across the top of the bar and
formed with his lips rather than spoke the words

Put up a drink

  Put up a drinkie Give me a drink on credit or
 Chalk it up

She shook her head tightly and went on reading

He staggered up and leaning on the bar made desperate distress
signals with hand eyes and mouth

No she snapped I means no when I says no Youve had too many last
drinks already and the boss says you aint to have another If you
swear again or bother me Ill call him

He hung sullenly on the counter for a while then lurched to his
swag and shouldered it hopelessly and wearily Then he blinked round
whistled waited a moment went on to the front verandah peered round
through the heat with bloodshot eyes and whistled again He turned and
started through to the backdoor

What the devil do you want now demanded the girl interrupted in her
reading for the third time by him Stampin all over the house You
cant go through there Its privit I do wish to goodness youd git

Where the blazes is that there dog o mine got to he muttered Did
you see a dog

No What do I want with your dog

He whistled out in front again and round each corner Then he came back
with a decided step and tone

Look here that there dog was lyin there agin the wall when I went
to sleep He wouldnt stir from me or my swag in a year if he wasnt
dragged Hes been blanky well touched stolen and I wouldnter lost
him for a fiver Are you sure you aint seen a dog then suddenly as
the thought struck him Wheres them two chaps that was playin cards
when I wenter sleep

Why exclaimed the girl without thinking there was a dog now I
come to think of it but I thought it belonged to one of them chaps
Anyway they played for it and the other chap won it and took it away

He stared at her blankly with thunder gathering in the blankness

What sort of a dog was it

Dog described the chain round the neck settled it

He scowled at her darkly

Now look here he said youve allowed gamblin in this baryour
boss has Youve got no right to let spielers gamble away a mans dog
Is a customer to lose his dog every time he has a doze to suit your
boss Ill go straight across to the police camp and put you away and
I dont care if you lose your licence I aint goin to lose my dog I
wouldnter taken a tenpound note for that blanky dog I

She was filling a pewter hastily

Here for Gods sake have a drink an stop yer row

He drank with satisfaction Then he hung on the bar with one elbow and
scowled out the door

Which blanky way did them chaps go he growled

The one that took the dog went towards Tinned Dog

And Ill haveter go all the blanky way back after him and most likely
lose me shed Here jerking the empty pewter across the bar fill that
up again Im narked properly I am and Ill take twentyfour blanky
hours to cool down now I wouldnter lost that dog for twenty quid

He drank again with deeper satisfaction then he shuffled out
muttering swearing and threatening louder every step and took the
track to Tinned Dog

 

Now the man girl or woman who told me this yarn has never quite
settled it in his or her mind as to who really owned the dog I leave it
to you




Telling Mrs Baker


Most Bushmen who hadnt known Bob Baker to speak to had heard tell
of him Hed been a squatter not many years before on the Macquarie
river in New South Wales and had made money in the good seasons and
had gone in for horseracing and racehorsebreeding and long trips to
Sydney where he put up at swell hotels and went the pace So after a
pretty severe drought when the sheep died by thousands on his runs Bob
Baker went under and the bank took over his station and put a manager
in charge

Hed been a jolly openhanded popular man which means that hed been
a selfish man as far as his wife and children were concerned for
they had to suffer for it in the end Such generosity is often born of
vanity or moral cowardice or both mixed Its very nice to hear the
chaps sing For hes a jolly good fellow but youve mostly got to pay
for it twicefirst in company and afterwards alone I once heard the
chaps singing that I was a jolly good fellow when I was leaving a place
and they were giving me a sendoff It thrilled me and brought a warm
gush to my eyes but all the same I wished I had half the money Id
lent them and spent on em and I wished Id used the time Id wasted
to be a jolly good fellow

When I first met Bob Baker he was a bossdrover on the great
northwestern route and his wife lived at the township of Solong on
the Sydney side He was going north to new country round by the Gulf of
Carpentaria with a big mob of cattle on a two years trip and I and
my mate Andy MCulloch engaged to go with him We wanted to have a
look at the Gulf Country

After we had crossed the Queensland border it seemed to me that the Boss
was too fond of going into wayside shanties and town pubs Andy had been
with him on another trip and he told me that the Boss was only going
this way lately Andy knew Mrs Baker well and seemed to think a deal of
her Shes a good little woman said Andy One of the right stuff I
worked on their station for a while when I was a nipper and I know
She was always a damned sight too good for the Boss but she believed in
him When I was coming away this time she says to me Look here Andy
Im afraid Robert is drinking again Now I want you to look after him
for me as much as you canyou seem to have as much influence with him
as any one I want you to promise me that youll never have a drink with
him

And I promised said Andy and Ill keep my word Andy was a chap
who could keep his word and nothing else And no matter how the Boss
persuaded or sneered or swore at him Andy would never drink with him

It got worse and worse the Boss would ride on ahead and get drunk at a
shanty and sometimes hed be days behind us and when hed catch up to
us his temper would be just about as much as we could stand At last he
went on a howling spree at Mulgatown about a hundred and fifty miles
north of the border and what was worse he got in tow with a flash
barmaid thereone of those girls who are engaged by the publicans up
country as baits for chequemen

He went mad over that girl He drew an advance cheque from the
stockowners agent there and knocked that down then he raised some
more money somehow and spent thatmostly on the girl

We did all we could Andy got him along the track for a couple of
stages and just when we thought he was all right he slipped us in the
night and went back

We had two other men with us but had the devils own bother on account
of the cattle It was a mixedup job all round You see it was all big
runs round there and we had to keep the bullocks moving along the route
all the time or else get into trouble for trespass The agent wasnt
going to go to the expense of putting the cattle in a paddock until
the Boss sobered up there was very little grass on the route or the
travellingstock reserves or camps so we had to keep travelling for
grass

The world might wobble and all the banks go bung but the cattle have
to go throughthats the law of the stockroutes So the agent wired
to the owners and when he got their reply he sacked the Boss and sent
the cattle on in charge of another man The new Boss was a drover coming
south after a trip he had his two brothers with him so he didnt want
me and Andy but anyway we were full up of this trip so we arranged
between the agent and the new Boss to get most of the wages due to
usthe Boss had drawn some of our stuff and spent it

We could have started on the back track at once but drunk or sober
mad or sane good or bad it isnt Bush religion to desert a mate in a
hole and the Boss was a mate of ours so we stuck to him

We camped on the creek outside the town and kept him in the camp with
us as much as possible and did all we could for him

How could I face his wife if I went home without him asked Andy or
any of his old mates

The Boss got himself turned out of the pub where the barmaid was and
then hed hang round the other pubs and get drink somehow and fight
and get knocked about He was an awful object by this time wildeyed
and gaunt and he hadnt washed or shaved for days

Andy got the constable in charge of the police station to lock him up
for a night but it only made him worse we took him back to the camp
next morning and while our eyes were off him for a few minutes he
slipped away into the scrub stripped himself naked and started to hang
himself to a leaning tree with a piece of clothesline rope We got to
him just in time

Then Andy wired to the Bosss brother Ned who was fighting the drought
the rabbitpest and the banks on a small station back on the border
Andy reckoned it was about time to do something

Perhaps the Boss hadnt been quite right in his head before he started
drinkinghe had acted queer some time now we came to think of
it maybe hed got a touch of sunstroke or got brooding over his
troublesanyway he died in the horrors within the week

His brother Ned turned up on the last day and Bob thought he was the
devil and grappled with him It took the three of us to hold the Boss
down sometimes

Sometimes towards the end hed be sensible for a few minutes and talk
about his poor wife and children and immediately afterwards hed
fall acursing me and Andy and Ned and calling us devils He cursed
everything he cursed his wife and children and yelled that they were
dragging him down to hell He died raving mad It was the worst case of
death in the horrors of drink that I ever saw or heard of in the Bush

Ned saw to the funeral it was very hot weather and men have to be
buried quick who die out there in the hot weatherespecially men who
die in the state the Boss was in Then Ned went to the publichouse
where the barmaid was and called the landlord out It was a desperate
fight the publican was a big man and a bit of a fighting man but
Ned was one of those quiet simpleminded chaps who will carry a thing
through to death when they make up their minds He gave that publican
nearly as good a thrashing as he deserved The constable in charge of
the station backed Ned while another policeman picked up the publican
Sounds queer to you city people doesnt it

Next morning we three started south We stayed a couple of days at
Ned Bakers station on the border and then started on our
threehundredmile ride downcountry The weather was still very hot so
we decided to travel at night for a while and left Neds place at dusk
He parted from us at the homestead gate He gave Andy a small packet
done up in canvas for Mrs Baker which Andy told me contained Bobs
pocketbook letters and papers We looked back after wed gone a
piece along the dusty road and saw Ned still standing by the gate and
a very lonely figure he looked Ned was a bachelor Poor old Ned said
Andy to me He was in love with Mrs Bob Baker before she got married
but she picked the wrong mangirls mostly do Ned and Bob were together
on the Macquarie but Ned left when his brother married and hes been
up in these Godforsaken scrubs ever since Look I want to tell you
something Jack Ned has written to Mrs Bob to tell her that Bob died of
fever and everything was done for him that could be done and that he
died easyand all that sort of thing Ned sent her some money and she
is to think that it was the money due to Bob when he died Now Ill have
to go and see her when we get to Solong theres no getting out of it
Ill have to face herand youll have to come with me

Damned if I will I said

But youll have to said Andy Youll have to stick to me youre
surely not crawler enough to desert a mate in a case like this Ill
have to lie like hellIll have to lie as I never lied to a woman
before and youll have to back me and corroborate every lie

Id never seen Andy show so much emotion

Theres plenty of time to fix up a good yarn said Andy He said no
more about Mrs Baker and we only mentioned the Bosss name casually
until we were within about a days ride of Solong then Andy told me the
yarn hed made up about the Bosss death

And I want you to listen Jack he said and remember every wordand
if you can fix up a better yarn you can tell me afterwards Now it
was like this the Boss wasnt too well when he crossed the border He
complained of pains in his back and head and a stinging pain in the back
of his neck and he had dysentery badbut that doesnt matter its
lucky I aint supposed to tell a woman all the symptoms The Boss stuck
to the job as long as he could but we managed the cattle and made it as
easy as we could for him Hed just take it easy and ride on from camp
to camp and rest One night I rode to a town off the route or you did
if you like and got some medicine for him that made him better for a
while but at last a day or two this side of Mulgatown he had to give
up A squatter there drove him into town in his buggy and put him up
at the best hotel The publican knew the Boss and did all he could for
himput him in the best room and wired for another doctor We wired for
Ned as soon as we saw how bad the Boss was and Ned rode night and day
and got there three days before the Boss died The Boss was a bit off
his head some of the time with the fever but was calm and quiet towards
the end and died easy He talked a lot about his wife and children and
told us to tell the wife not to fret but to cheer up for the childrens
sake How does that sound

Id been thinking while I listened and an idea struck me

Why not let her know the truth I asked Shes sure to hear of
it sooner or later and if she knew he was only a selfish drunken
blackguard she might get over it all the sooner

You dont know women Jack said Andy quietly And anyway even if
she is a sensible woman weve got a dead mate to consider as well as a
living woman

But shes sure to hear the truth sooner or later I said the Boss
was so well known

And thats just the reason why the truth might be kept from her said
Andy If he wasnt well knownand nobody could help liking him after
all when he was straightif he wasnt so well known the truth might
leak out unawares She wont know if I can help it or at least not yet
a while If I see any chaps that come from the North Ill put them up
to it Ill tell MGrath the publican at Solong too hes a straight
manhell keep his ears open and warn chaps One of Mrs Bakers sisters
is staying with her and Ill give her a hint so that she can warn off
any women that might get hold of a yarn Besides Mrs Baker is sure to
go and live in Sydney where all her people areshe was a Sydney girl
and shes not likely to meet any one there that will tell her the truth
I can tell her that it was the last wish of the Boss that she should
shift to Sydney

We smoked and thought a while and byandby Andy had what he called a
happy thought He went to his saddlebags and got out the small canvas
packet that Ned had given him it was sewn up with packingthread and
Andy ripped it open with his pocketknife

What are you doing Andy I asked

Neds an innocent old fool as far as sin is concerned said Andy I
guess he hasnt looked through the Bosss letters and Im just going to
see that theres nothing here that will make liars of us

He looked through the letters and papers by the light of the fire There
were some letters from Mrs Baker to her husband also a portrait of her
and the children these Andy put aside But there were other letters
from barmaids and women who were not fit to be seen in the same street
with the Bosss wife and there were portraitsone or two flash ones
There were two letters from other mens wives too

And one of those men at least was an old mate of his said Andy in
a tone of disgust

He threw the lot into the fire then he went through the Bosss
pocketbook and tore out some leaves that had notes and addresses on
them and burnt them too Then he sewed up the packet again and put it
away in his saddlebag

Such is life said Andy with a yawn that might have been half a sigh

We rode into Solong early in the day turned our horses out in a
paddock and put up at MGraths pub until such time as we made up our
minds as to what wed do or where wed go We had an idea of waiting
until the shearing season started and then making OutBack to the big
sheds

Neither of us was in a hurry to go and face Mrs Baker Well go after
dinner said Andy at first then after dinner we had a drink and felt
sleepywe werent used to big dinners of roastbeef and vegetables and
pudding and besides it was drowsy weatherso we decided to have a
snooze and then go When we woke up it was late in the afternoon so we
thought wed put it off till after tea It wouldnt be manners to walk
in while theyre at tea said Andyit would look as if we only came
for some grub

But while we were at tea a little girl came with a message that Mrs
Baker wanted to see us and would be very much obliged if wed call
up as soon as possible You see in those small towns you cant move
without the thing getting round inside of half an hour

Well have to face the music now said Andy and no get out of it
He seemed to hang back more than I did There was another pub opposite
where Mrs Baker lived and when we got up the street a bit I said to
Andy

Suppose we go and have another drink first Andy We might be kept in
there an hour or two

You dont want another drink said Andy rather short Why you seem
to be going the same way as the Boss But it was Andy that edged off
towards the pub when we got near Mrs Bakers place All right he
said Come on Well have this other drink since you want it so bad

We had the drink then we buttoned up our coats and started across the
roadwed bought new shirts and collars and spruced up a bit Halfway
across Andy grabbed my arm and asked

How do you feel now Jack

Oh IM all right I said

For Gods sake said Andy dont put your foot in it and make a mess
of it

I wont if you dont

Mrs Bakers cottage was a little weatherboard box affair back in a
garden When we went in through the gate Andy gripped my arm again and
whispered

For Gods sake stick to me now Jack

Ill stick all right I saidyouve been having too much beer
Andy

I had seen Mrs Baker before and remembered her as a cheerful contented
sort of woman bustling about the house and getting the Bosss shirts
and things ready when we started North Just the sort of woman that is
contented with housework and the children and with nothing particular
about her in the way of brains But now she sat by the fire looking like
the ghost of herself I wouldnt have recognised her at first I never
saw such a change in a woman and it came like a shock to me

Her sister let us in and after a first glance at Mrs Baker I had eyes
for the sister and no one else She was a Sydney girl about twentyfour
or twentyfive and fresh and fairnot like the sunbrowned women we
were used to see She was a pretty brighteyed girl and seemed quick
to understand and very sympathetic She had been educated Andy had
told me and wrote stories for the Sydney Bulletin and other Sydney
papers She had her hair done and was dressed in the city style and
that took us back a bit at first

Its very good of you to come said Mrs Baker in a weak weary voice
when we first went in I heard you were in town

We were just coming when we got your message said Andy Wed have
come before only we had to see to the horses

Its very kind of you Im sure said Mrs Baker

They wanted us to have tea but we said wed just had it Then Miss
Standish the sister wanted us to have tea and cake but we didnt feel
as if we could handle cups and saucers and pieces of cake successfully
just then

There was something the matter with one of the children in a backroom
and the sister went to see to it Mrs Baker cried a little quietly

You mustnt mind me she said Ill be all right presently and then
I want you to tell me all about poor Bob Its seeing you that saw the
last of him that set me off

Andy and I sat stiff and straight on two chairs against the wall
and held our hats tight and stared at a picture of Wellington meeting
Blucher on the opposite wall I thought it was lucky that that picture
was there

The child was calling mumma and Mrs Baker went in to it and her
sister came out Best tell her all about it and get it over she
whispered to Andy Shell never be content until she hears all about
poor Bob from some one who was with him when he died Let me take your
hats Make yourselves comfortable

She took the hats and put them on the sewingmachine I wished shed let
us keep them for now we had nothing to hold on to and nothing to do
with our hands and as for being comfortable we were just about as
comfortable as two cats on wet bricks

When Mrs Baker came into the room she brought little Bobby Baker about
four years old he wanted to see Andy He ran to Andy at once and Andy
took him up on his knee He was a pretty child but he reminded me too
much of his father

Im so glad youve come Andy said Bobby

Are you Bobby

Yes I wants to ask you about daddy You saw him go away didnt you
and he fixed his great wondering eyes on Andys face

Yes said Andy

He went up among the stars didnt he

Yes said Andy

And he isnt coming back to Bobby any more

No said Andy But Bobbys going to him byandby

Mrs Baker had been leaning back in her chair resting her head on her
hand tears glistening in her eyes now she began to sob and her sister
took her out of the room

Andy looked miserable I wish to God I was off this job he whispered
to me

Is that the girl that writes the stories I asked

Yes he said staring at me in a hopeless sort of way and poems
too

Is Bobby going up among the stars asked Bobby

Yes said Andyif Bobbys good

And auntie

Yes

And mumma

Yes

Are you going Andy

Yes said Andy hopelessly

Did you see daddy go up amongst the stars Andy

Yes said Andy I saw him go up

And he isnt coming down again any more

No said Andy

Why isnt he

Because hes going to wait up there for you and mumma Bobby

There was a long pause and then Bobby asked

Are you going to give me a shilling Andy with the same expression of
innocent wonder in his eyes

Andy slipped halfacrown into his hand Auntie came in and told him
hed see Andy in the morning and took him away to bed after hed kissed
us both solemnly and presently she and Mrs Baker settled down to hear
Andys story

Brace up now Jack and keep your wits about you whispered Andy to me
just before they came in

Poor Bobs brother Ned wrote to me said Mrs Baker but he scarcely
told me anything Neds a good fellow but hes very simple and never
thinks of anything

Andy told her about the Boss not being well after he crossed the border

I knew he was not well said Mrs Baker before he left I didnt want
him to go I tried hard to persuade him not to go this trip I had a
feeling that I oughtnt to let him go But hed never think of anything
but me and the children He promised hed give up droving after this
trip and get something to do near home The life was too much for
himriding in all weathers and camping out in the rain and living like
a dog But he was never content at home It was all for the sake of me
and the children He wanted to make money and start on a station again
I shouldnt have let him go He only thought of me and the children Oh
my poor dear kind dead husband She broke down again and sobbed and
her sister comforted her while Andy and I stared at Wellington meeting
Blucher on the field of Waterloo I thought the artist had heaped up the
dead a bit extra and I thought that I wouldnt like to be trod on by
horses even if I was dead

Dont you mind said Miss Standish shell be all right presently
and she handed us the Illustrated Sydney Journal This was a great
reliefwe bumped our heads over the pictures

Mrs Baker made Andy go on again and he told her how the Boss broke down
near Mulgatown Mrs Baker was opposite him and Miss Standish opposite
me Both of them kept their eyes on Andys face he sat with his hair
straight up like a brush as usual and kept his big innocent grey eyes
fixed on Mrs Bakers face all the time he was speaking I watched Miss
Standish I thought she was the prettiest girl Id ever seen it was a
bad case of love at first sight but she was far and away above me and
the case was hopeless I began to feel pretty miserable and to think
back into the past I just heard Andy droning away by my side

So we fixed him up comfortable in the waggonette with the blankets
and coats and things Andy was saying and the squatter started into
Mulgatown It was about thirty miles Jack wasnt it he asked
turning suddenly to me He always looked so innocent that there were
times when I itched to knock him down

More like thirtyfive I said waking up

Miss Standish fixed her eyes on me and I had another look at Wellington
and Blucher

They were all very good and kind to the Boss said Andy They thought
a lot of him up there Everybody was fond of him

I know it said Mrs Baker Nobody could help liking him He was one
of the kindest men that ever lived

Tanner the publican couldnt have been kinder to his own brother
said Andy The local doctor was a decent chap but he was only a young
fellow and Tanner hadnt much faith in him so he wired for an older
doctor at Mackintyre and he even sent out fresh horses to meet the
doctors buggy Everything was done that could be done I assure you
Mrs Baker

I believe it said Mrs Baker And you dont know how it relieves me
to hear it And did the publican do all this at his own expense

He wouldnt take a penny Mrs Baker

He must have been a good true man I wish I could thank him

Oh Ned thanked him for you said Andy though without meaning more
than he said

I wouldnt have fancied that Ned would have thought of that said Mrs
Baker When I first heard of my poor husbands death I thought perhaps
hed been drinking againthat worried me a bit

He never touched a drop after he left Solong I can assure you Mrs
Baker said Andy quickly

Now I noticed that Miss Standish seemed surprised or puzzled once or
twice while Andy was speaking and leaned forward to listen to him
then she leaned back in her chair and clasped her hands behind her head
and looked at him with halfshut eyes in a way I didnt like Once or
twice she looked at me as if she was going to ask me a question but I
always looked away quick and stared at Blucher and Wellington or into
the empty fireplace till I felt that her eyes were off me Then she
asked Andy a question or two in all innocence I believe now but it
scared him and at last he watched his chance and winked at her sharp
Then she gave a little gasp and shut up like a steel trap

The sick child in the bedroom coughed and cried again Mrs Baker went
to it We three sat like a deafanddumb institution Andy and I staring
all over the place presently Miss Standish excused herself and went
out of the room after her sister She looked hard at Andy as she left
the room but he kept his eyes away

Brace up now Jack whispered Andy to me the worst is coming

When they came in again Mrs Baker made Andy go on with his story

Hehe died very quietly said Andy hitching round and resting his
elbows on his knees and looking into the fireplace so as to have his
face away from the light Miss Standish put her arm round her sister
He died very easy said Andy He was a bit off his head at times but
that was while the fever was on him He didnt suffer much towards the
endI dont think he suffered at all He talked a lot about you and
the children Andy was speaking very softly now He said that you
were not to fret but to cheer up for the childrens sake It was the
biggest funeral ever seen round there

Mrs Baker was crying softly Andy got the packet half out of his pocket
but shoved it back again

The only thing that hurts me now says Mrs Baker presently is to
think of my poor husband buried out there in the lonely Bush so far
from home Itscruel and she was sobbing again

Oh thats all right Mrs Baker said Andy losing his head a little
Ned will see to that Ned is going to arrange to have him brought down
and buried in Sydney Which was about the first thing Andy had told her
that evening that wasnt a lie Ned had said he would do it as soon as
he sold his wool

Its very kind indeed of Ned sobbed Mrs Baker Id never have
dreamed he was so kindhearted and thoughtful I misjudged him all
along And that is all you have to tell me about poor Robert

Yes said Andythen one of his happy thoughts struck him Except
that he hoped youd shift to Sydney Mrs Baker where youve got friends
and relations He thought it would be better for you and the children
He told me to tell you that

He was thoughtful up to the end said Mrs Baker It was just like
poor Robertalways thinking of me and the children We are going to
Sydney next week

Andy looked relieved We talked a little more and Miss Standish wanted
to make coffee for us but we had to go and see to our horses We got up
and bumped against each other and got each others hats and promised
Mrs Baker wed come again

Thank you very much for coming she said shaking hands with us I
feel much better now You dont know how much you have relieved me Now
mind you have promised to come and see me again for the last time

Andy caught her sisters eye and jerked his head towards the door to let
her know he wanted to speak to her outside

Goodbye Mrs Baker he said holding on to her hand And dont you
fret Youveyouve got the children yet Itsits all for the best
and besides the Boss said you wasnt to fret And he blundered out
after me and Miss Standish

She came out to the gate with us and Andy gave her the packet

I want you to give that to her he said its his letters and papers
I hadnt the heart to give it to her somehow

Tell me Mr MCulloch she said Youve kept something backyou
havent told her the truth It would be better and safer for me to know
Was it an accidentor the drink

It was the drink said Andy I was going to tell youI thought it
would be best to tell you I had made up my mind to do it but somehow
I couldnt have done it if you hadnt asked me

Tell me all she said It would be better for me to know

Come a little farther away from the house said Andy She came along
the fence a piece with us and Andy told her as much of the truth as he
could

Ill hurry her off to Sydney she said We can get away this week as
well as next Then she stood for a minute before us breathing quickly
her hands behind her back and her eyes shining in the moonlight She
looked splendid

I want to thank you for her sake she said quickly You are good men
I like the Bushmen They are grand menthey are noble Ill probably
never see either of you again so it doesnt matter and she put her
white hand on Andys shoulder and kissed him fair and square on the
mouth And you too she said to me I was taller than Andy and had
to stoop Goodbye she said and ran to the gate and in waving her
hand to us We lifted our hats again and turned down the road

I dont think it did either of us any harm




A Hero in DingoScrubs


This is a storyabout the only oneof Job Falconer Boss of the
Talbragar sheepstation up country in New South Wales in the early
Eightieswhen there were still runs in the DingoScrubs out of the
hands of the banks and yet squatters who lived on their stations

Job would never tell the story himself at least not complete and as
his family grew up he would become as angry as it was in his easygoing
nature to become if reference were made to the incident in his presence
But his wifelittle plump brighteyed Gerty Falconeroften told the
story in the mysterious voice which women use in speaking of private
matters amongst themselvesbut with brightening eyes to women friends
over tea and always to a new woman friend And on such occasions she
would be particularly tender towards the unconscious Job and ruffle his
thin sandy hair in a way that embarrassed him in companymade him look
as sheepish as an old bighorned ram that has just been shorn and turned
amongst the ewes And the woman friend on parting would give Jobs hand
a squeeze which would surprise him mildly and look at him as if she
could love him

According to a theory of mine Job to fit the story should have been
tall and dark and stern or gloomy and quicktempered But he wasnt
He was fairly tall but he was freshcomplexioned and sandy his skin
was pink to scarlet in some weathers with blotches of umber and his
eyes were palegrey his big forehead loomed babyishly his arms were
short and his legs bowed to the saddle Altogether he was an awkward
unlovely Bush birdon foot in the saddle it was different He hadnt
even a temper

The impression on Jobs mind which many years afterwards brought about
the incident was strong enough When Job was a boy of fourteen he saw
his fathers horse come home riderlesscircling and snorting up by the
stockyard head jerked down whenever the hoof trod on one of the snapped
ends of the bridlereins and saddle twisted over the side with bruised
pommel and kneepad broken off

Jobs father wasnt hurt much but Jobs mother an emotional woman and
then in a delicate state of health survived the shock for three months
only She wasnt quite right in her head they said from the day
the horse came home till the last hour before she died And strange to
say Jobs father from whom Job inherited his seemingly placid nature
died three months later The doctor from the town was of the opinion
that he must have sustained internal injuries when the horse threw
him Doc Wild eccentric Bush doctor reckoned that Jobs father was
hurt inside when his wife died and hurt so badly that he couldnt pull
round But doctors differ all over the world


Well the story of Job himself came about in this way He had been
married a year and had lately started woolraising on a pastoral lease
he had taken up at Talbragar it was a new run with new slabandbark
huts on the creek for a homestead new shearingshed yardswife and
everything new and he was expecting a baby Job felt brandnew himself
at the time so he said It was a lonely place for a young woman
but Gerty was a settlers daughter The newness took away some of the
loneliness she said and there was truth in that a Bush home in the
scrubs looks lonelier the older it gets and ghostlier in the twilight
as the bark and slabs whiten or rather grow grey in fierce summers
And theres nothing under Gods sky so weird so aggressively lonely as
a deserted old home in the Bush

Jobs wife had a halfcaste gin for company when Job was away on the
run and the nearest white woman a hard but honest Lancashire woman
from within the kicking radius in Lancashirewife of a selector was
only seven miles away She promised to be on hand and came over two or
three times aweek but Job grew restless as Gertys time drew near and
wished that he had insisted on sending her to the nearest town thirty
miles away as originally proposed Gertys mother who lived in town
was coming to see her over her trouble Job had made arrangements with
the town doctor but prompt attendance could hardly be expected of a
doctor who was very busy who was too fat to ride and who lived thirty
miles away

Job in common with most Bushmen and their families round there had
more faith in Doc Wild a weird Yankee who made medicine in a saucepan
and worked more cures on Bushmen than did the other three doctors of
the district togethermaybe because the Bushmen had faith in him or
he knew the Bush and Bush constitutionsor perhaps because hed do
things which no respectable practitioner dared do Ive described him
in another story Some said he was a quack and some said he wasnt
There are scores of wrecks and mysteries like him in the Bush He drank
fearfully and on his own but was seldom incapable of performing an
operation Experienced Bushmen preferred him threequarters drunk when
perfectly sober he was apt to be a bit shaky He was tall gaunt had
a pointed black moustache bushy eyebrows and piercing black eyes His
movements were eccentric He lived where he happened to bein a town
hotel in the best room of a homestead in the skillion of a slygrog
shanty in a shearers diggers shepherds or boundaryriders hut
in a surveyors camp or a blackfellows campor when the horrors were
on him by a log in the lonely Bush It seemed all one to him He lost
all his things sometimeseven his clothes but he never lost a pigskin
bag which contained his surgical instruments and papers Except once
then he gave the blacks 5 Pounds to find it for him

His patients included all from the big squatter to Black Jimmy and he
rode as far and fast to a squatters home as to a swagmans camp When
nothing was to be expected from a poor selector or a station hand and
the doctor was hard up he went to the squatter for a few pounds He
had on occasions been offered cheques of 50 Pounds and 100 Pounds by
squatters for pulling round their wives or children but such offers
always angered him When he asked for 5 Pounds he resented being offered
a 10 Pound cheque He once sued a doctor for alleging that he held no
diploma but the magistrate on reading certain papers suggested a
settlement out of court which both doctors agreed tothe other doctor
apologising briefly in the local paper It was noticed thereafter
that the magistrate and town doctors treated Doc Wild with great
respecteven at his worst The thing was never explained and the case
deepened the mystery which surrounded Doc Wild

As Job Falconers crisis approached Doc Wild was located at a shanty
on the main road about halfway between Jobs station and the town
Township of ComebyChanceexpressive name and the shanty was the
Dead Dingo Hotel kept by James Mylesknown as Poisonous Jimmy
perhaps as a compliment to or a libel on the liquor he sold Jobs
brother Mac was stationed at the Dead Dingo Hotel with instructions
to hang round on some pretence see that the doctor didnt either drink
himself into the DTs or get sober enough to become restless to
prevent his going away or to follow him if he did and to bring him
to the station in about a weeks time Mac rather more careless
brighter and more energetic than his brother was carrying out these
instructions while pretending with rather great success to be himself
on the spree at the shanty

But one morning early in the specified week Jobs uneasiness was
suddenly greatly increased by certain symptoms so he sent the black boy
for the neighbours wife and decided to ride to ComebyChance to hurry
out Gertys mother and see by the way how Doc Wild and Mac were
getting on On the arrival of the neighbours wife who drove over in a
springcart Job mounted his horse a freshly broken filly and started

Dont be anxious Job said Gerty as he bent down to kiss her Well
be all right Wait youd better take the gunyou might see those
dingoes again Ill get it for you

The dingoes native dogs were very bad amongst the sheep and Job and
Gerty had started three together close to the track the last time they
were out in companywithout the gun of course Gerty took the loaded
gun carefully down from its straps on the bedroom wall carried it out
and handed it up to Job who bent and kissed her again and then rode
off

It was a hot daythe beginning of a long drought as Job found to his
bitter cost He followed the track for five or six miles through the
thick monotonous scrub and then turned off to make a short cut to the
main road across a big ringbarked flat The tall gumtrees had been
ringbarked a ring of bark taken out round the butts or rather
sappedthat is a ring cut in through the sapin order to kill them
so that the little strength in the poor soil should not be drawn out
by the living roots and the natural grass on which Australian stock
depends should have a better show The hard dead trees raised their
barkless and whitened trunks and leafless branches for three or four
miles and the grey and brown grass stood tall between dying in the
first breaths of the coming drought All was becoming grey and ashen
here the heat blazing and dancing across objects and the pale brassy
dome of the sky cloudless over all the sun a glaring white disc with
its edges almost melting into the sky Job held his gun carelessly ready
it was a doublebarrelled muzzleloader one barrel chokebore for
shot and the other rifled and he kept an eye out for dingoes He was
saving his horse for a long ride jogging along in the careless Bush
fashion hitched a little to one sideand Im not sure that he didnt
have a leg thrown up and across in front of the pommel of the saddlehe
was riding along in the careless Bush fashion and thinking
fatherly thoughts in advance perhaps when suddenly a great black
greasylooking iguana scuttled off from the side of the track amongst
the dry tufts of grass and shreds of dead bark and started up a
sapling It was a whopper Job said afterwards must have been over
six feet and a foot across the body It scared me nearly as much as the
filly

The filly shied off like a rocket Job kept his seat instinctively
as was natural to him but before he could more than grab at the
reinlying loosely on the pommelthe filly fetched up against a dead
boxtree hard as castiron and Jobs left leg was jammed from stirrup
to pocket I felt the blood flare up he said and I knowed that
thatJob swore now and then in an easygoing wayI knowed that
that blanky leg was broken alright I threw the gun from me and freed
my left foot from the stirrup with my hand and managed to fall to the
right as the filly started off again

What follows comes from the statements of Doc Wild and Mac Falconer
and Jobs own wanderings in his mind as he called them They took
a blanky mean advantage of me he said when they had me down and I
couldnt talk sense

The filly circled off a bit and then stood staringas a mob of
brumbies when fired at will sometimes stand watching the smoke Jobs
leg was smashed badly and the pain must have been terrible But he
thought then with a flash as men do in a fix No doubt the scene at
the lonely Bush home of his boyhood started up before him his fathers
horse appeared riderless and he saw the look in his mothers eyes

Now a Bushmans first best and quickest chance in a fix like this is
that his horse go home riderless the home be alarmed and the horses
tracks followed back to him otherwise he might lie there for days for
weekstill the growing grass buries his mouldering bones Job was on an
old sheeptrack across a flat where few might have occasion to come for
months but he did not consider this He crawled to his gun then to a
log dragging gun and smashed leg after him How he did it he doesnt
know Halflying on one side he rested the barrel on the log took aim
at the filly pulled both triggers and then fell over and lay with his
head against the log and the gunbarrel sliding down rested on his
neck He had fainted The crows were interested and the ants would come
byandby


Now Doc Wild had inspirations anyway he did things which seemed
after they were done to have been suggested by inspiration and in no
other possible way He often turned up where and when he was wanted
above all men and at no other time He had gipsy blood they said but
anyway being the mystery he was and having the face he had and living
the life he livedand doing the things he didit was quite probable
that he was more nearly in touch than we with that awful invisible world
all round and between us of which we only see distorted faces and hear
disjointed utterances when we are suffering a recoveryor going mad

On the morning of Jobs accident and after a long brooding silence
Doc Wild suddenly said to Mac Falconer

Git the hosses Mac Well go to the station

Mac used to the doctors eccentricities went to see about the horses

And then who should drive up but Mrs SpencerJobs motherinlawon
her way from the town to the station She stayed to have a cup of tea
and give her horses a feed She was squarefaced and considered a
rather hard and practical woman but she had plenty of solid flesh good
sympathetic commonsense and deepset humorous blue eyes She lived
in the town comfortably on the interest of some money which her husband
left in the bank She drove an American waggonette with a good width
and length of tray behind and on this occasion she had a pole and two
horses In the trap were a new flock mattress and pillows a generous
pair of new white blankets and boxes containing necessaries
delicacies and luxuries All round she was an excellent motherinlaw
for a man to have on hand at a critical time

And speaking of motherinlaw I would like to put in a word for her
right here She is universally considered a nuisance in times of peace
and comfort but when illness or serious trouble comes home Then its

motherinlaw all times

Mac had some trouble in finding and catching one of the horses Mrs
Spencer drove on and Mac and the doctor caught up to her about a mile
before she reached the homestead track which turned in through the
scrubs at the corner of the big ringbarked flat

Doc Wild and Mac followed the cartroad and as they jogged along in
the edge of the scrub the doctor glanced once or twice across the flat
through the dead naked branches Mac looked that way The crows were
hopping about the branches of a tree way out in the middle of the flat
flopping down from branch to branch to the grass then rising hurriedly
and circling

Dead beast there said Mac out of his Bushcraft

Nodying said Doc Wild with less Bush experience but more
intellect

Theres some steers of Jobs out there somewhere muttered Mac Then
suddenly It aint droughtits the ploorer at last or Im blanked

Mac feared the advent of that cattleplague pleuropneumonia which
was raging on some other stations but had been hitherto kept clear of
Jobs run

Well go and see if you like suggested Doc Wild

They turned out across the flat the horses picking their way amongst
the dried tufts and fallen branches

Theer aint no sign o cattle theer said the doctor more likely a
ewe in trouble about her lamb

Oh the blanky dingoes at the sheep said Mac I wish we had a
gunmight get a shot at them

Doc Wild hitched the skirt of a long China silk coat he wore free of
a hippocket He always carried a revolver In case I feel obliged to
shoot a first person singular one of these hot days he explained once
whereat Bushmen scratched the backs of their heads and thought feebly
without result

Wed never git near enough for a shot said the doctor then he
commenced to hum fragments from a Bush song about the finding of a lost
Bushman in the last stages of death by thirst

 The crows kept flyin up boys
 The crows kept flyin up
 The dog he seen and whimpered boys
 Though he was but a pup

It must be something or other muttered Mac Look at them blanky
crows

 The lost was found we brought him round
 And took him from the place
 While the ants was swarmin on the ground
 And the crows was sayin grace

My God whats that cried Mac who was a little in advance and rode
a tall horse

It was Jobs filly lying saddled and bridled with a riflebullet as
they found on subsequent examination through shoulders and chest and
her head full of kangarooshot She was feebly rocking her head against
the ground and marking the dust with her hoof as if trying to write
the reason of it there

The doctor drew his revolver took a cartridge from his waistcoat
pocket and put the filly out of her misery in a very scientific manner
then somethingprofessional instinct or the something supernatural
about the doctorled him straight to the log hidden in the grass
where Job lay as we left him and about fifty yards from the dead filly
which must have staggered off some little way after being shot Mac
followed the doctor shaking violently

Oh my God he cried with the woman in his voiceand his face so
pale that his freckles stood out like buttons as Doc Wild saidoh
my God hes shot himself

No he hasnt said the doctor deftly turning Job into a healthier
position with his head from under the log and his mouth to the air then
he ran his eyes and hands over him and Job moaned Hes got a
broken leg said the doctor Even then he couldnt resist making a
characteristic remark half to himself A man doesnt shoot himself
when hes going to be made a lawful father for the first time unless he
can see a long way into the future Then he took out his whiskyflask
and said briskly to Mac Leave me your waterbag Mac carried a
canvas waterbag slung under his horses neck ride back to the track
stop Mrs Spencer and bring the waggonette here Tell her its only a
broken leg

Mac mounted and rode off at a breakneck pace

As he worked the doctor muttered He shot his horse Thats what gits
me The fool might have lain there for a week Id never have suspected
spite in that carcass and I ought to know men

But as Job came round a little Doc Wild was enlightened

Wheres the filly cried Job suddenly between groans

Shes all right said the doctor

Stop her cried Job struggling to risestop heroh God my leg

Keep quiet you fool

Stop her yelled Job

Why stop her asked the doctor She wont go fur he added

Shell go home to Gerty shouted Job For Gods sake stop her

Oh drawled the doctor to himself I might have guessed that And I
ought to know men

Dont take me home demanded Job in a semisensible interval Take me
to Poisonous Jimmys and tell Gerty Im on the spree

When Mac and Mrs Spencer arrived with the waggonette Doc Wild was in
his shirtsleeves his Chinese silk coat having gone for bandages The
lower half of Jobs trouserleg and his lasticside boot lay on the
ground neatly cut off and his bandaged leg was sandwiched between
two strips of bark with grass stuffed in the hollows and bound by
saddlestraps

Thats all I kin do for him for the present

Mrs Spencer was a strong woman mentally but she arrived rather pale and
a little shaky nevertheless she called out as soon as she got within
earshot of the doctor

Whats Job been doing now Job by the way had never been remarkable
for doing anything

Hes got his leg broke and shot his horse replied the doctor But
he added whether hes been a hero or a fool I dunno Anyway its a
mess all round

They unrolled the bed blankets and pillows in the bottom of the trap
backed it against the log to have a step and got Job in It was a
ticklish job but they had to manage it Job maddened by pain and heat
only kept from fainting by whisky groaning and raving and yelling to
them to stop his horse

Lucky we got him before the ants did muttered the doctor Then he had
an inspiration

You bring him on to the shepherds hut this side the station We must
leave him there Drive carefully and pour brandy into him now and then
when the brandys done pour whisky then ginkeep the rum till the
last the doctor had put a supply of spirits in the waggonette at
Poisonous Jimmys Ill take Macs horse and ride on and send Peter
the station hand back to the hut to meet you Ill be back myself if
I can THIS BUSINESS WILL HURRY UP THINGS AT THE STATION

Which last was one of those apparently insane remarks of the doctors
which no sane nor sober man could fathom or see a reason forexcept in
Doc Wilds madness

He rode off at a gallop The burden of Jobs raving all the way rested
on the dead filly

Stop her She must not go home to Gerty God help me shoot
Whoawhoa there CopecopecopeSteady Jessie old girl
Aim straightaim straight Aim for me GodIve missed Stop her
c

I never met a character like that commented the doctor afterwards
inside a man that looked like Job on the outside Ive met men behind
revolvers and big mustarshes in Califonia but Ive met a derned sight
more men behind nothing but a goodnatured grin here in Australia
These lanky sawney Bushmen will do things in an easygoing way some day
thatll make the old world sit up and think hard

He reached the station in time and twenty minutes or half an hour
later he left the case in the hands of the Lancashire womanwhom he saw
reason to admireand rode back to the hut to help Job whom they soon
fixed up as comfortably as possible

They humbugged Mrs Falconer first with a yarn of Jobs alleged
phenomenal shyness and gradually as she grew stronger and the truth
less important they told it to her And so instead of Job being
pushed scarletfaced into the bedroom to see his firstborn Gerty
Falconer herself took the child down to the hut and so presented Uncle
Job with my first and favourite cousin and Bush chum

Doc Wild stayed round until he saw Job comfortably moved to the
homestead then he prepared to depart

Im sorry said Job who was still weakIm sorry for that there
filly I was breaking her in to sidesaddle for Gerty when she should
get about I wouldnt have lost her for twenty quid

Never mind Job said the doctor I too once shot an animal I was
fond ofand for the sake of a womanbut that animal walked on two legs
and wore trousers Goodbye Job

And he left for Poisonous Jimmys




The Little World Left Behind


I lately revisited a western agricultural district in Australia after
many years The railway had reached it but otherwise things were
drearily hopelessly depressingly unchanged There was the same old
grant comprising several thousands of acres of the richest land in the
district lying idle still except for a few horses allowed to run there
for a shilling ahead per week

There were the same old selectionsabout as far off as ever from
becoming freeholdsshoved back among the barren ridges dusty little
patches in the scrub full of stones and stumps and called farms
deserted every few years and tackled again by some little driedup
family or some old hatter and then given best once more There was
the cluster of farms on the flat and in the foot of the gully owned by
Australians of Irish or English descent with the same number of stumps
in the wheatpaddock the same broken fences and tumbledown huts and
yards and the same weak sleepy attempt made every season to scratch up
the ground and raise a crop And along the creek the German farmersthe
only people there worthy of the nametoiling men women and children
from daylight till dark like slaves just as they always had done the
elder sons stoopshouldered old men at thirty

The row about the boundary fence between the Sweeneys and the Joneses
was unfinished still and the old feud between the Dunderblitzens
and the Blitzendunders was more deadly than everit started three
generations ago over a stray bull The ODunn was still fighting for his
great object in life which was not to be onneighborly as he put it
I DONT want to be onneighborly he said but Ill be aven wid some
of em yit Its almost impossible for a dacent man to live in sich a
neighborhood and not be onneighborly thry how he will But Ill be aven
wid some of em yit marruk my wurrud

Joness red steerit couldnt have been the same red steerwas
continually breaking into Rooneys whate an bringin ivery head av
the other cattle afther him and ruinin him intirely The Rooneys and
MKenzies were at daggers drawn even to the youngest child over the
impounding of a horse belonging to Pat Rooneys brotherinlaw by a
distant relation of the MKenzies which had happened nine years ago

The same sunburned masculine women went past to market twice aweek
in the same old carts and driving much the same quality of carrion The
string of overloaded springcarts buggies and sweating horses went
whirling into town to service through clouds of dust and broiling
heat on Sunday morning and came driving cruelly out again at noon
The neighbours sons rode over in the afternoon as of old and hung up
their poor illused little horses to bake in the sun and sat on their
heels about the verandah and drawled drearily concerning crops fruit
trees and vines and horses and cattle the drought and smut and
rust in wheat and the ploorer pleuropneumonia in cattle
and other cheerful things that there colt or filly or that there
cattledog pup or bitch o mine or Jims They always talked
most of farming there where no farming worthy of the name was
possibleexcept by Germans and Chinamen Towards evening the old local
relic of the golden days dropped in and announced that he intended to
put down a shaft next week in a spot where hed been going to put
it down twenty years agoand every week since It was nearly time that
somebody sunk a hole and buried him there

An old local body named Mrs Witherly still went into town twice aweek
with her bit av prodjuce as ODunn called it She still drove a long
bony blind horse in a long rickety dray with a stout sapling for a
whip and about twenty yards of clothesline reins The floor of the
dray covered part of an acre and one wheel was always ahead of the
otheror behind according to which shaft was pulled She wore to all
appearances the same short frock faded shawl mens lastic sides and
white hood that she had on when the world was made She still stopped
just twenty minutes at old Mrs Leatherlys on the way in for a yarn and
a cup of teaas she had always done on the same days and at the same
time within the memory of the hoariest local liar However she had a
new clothesline bent on to the old horses front endand we fancy that
was the reason she didnt recognise us at first She had never looked
younger than a hard hundred within the memory of man Her shrivelled
face was the colour of leather and crossed and recrossed with lines
till there wasnt room for any more But her eyes were bright yet and
twinkled with humour at times

She had been in the Bush for fifty years and had fought fires
droughts hunger and thirst floods cattle and crop diseases and all
the things that God curses Australian settlers with She had had two
husbands and it could be said of neither that he had ever done an
honest days work or any good for himself or any one else She had
reared something under fifteen children her own and others and there
was scarcely one of them that had not given her trouble Her sons had
brought disgrace on her old head over and over again but she held up
that same old head through it all and looked her narrow ignorant world
in the faceand lived it down She had worked like a slave for fifty
years yet she had more energy and endurance than many modern city women
in her shrivelled old body She was a daughter of English aristocrats

And we who live our weak lives of fifty years or so in the citieswe
grow maudlin over our sorrows and beer and ask whether life is worth
living or not

I sought in the farming town relief from the general and particular
sameness of things but there was none The railway station was about
the only new building in town The old signs even were as badly in need
of retouching as of old I picked up a copy of the local Advertiser
which newspaper had been started in the early days by a brilliant
drunkard who drank himself to death just as the fathers of our nation
were beginning to get educated up to his style He might have made
Australian journalism very different from what it is There was nothing
new in the Advertiserthere had been nothing new since the last time
the drunkard had been sober enough to hold a pen There was the same
old enjoyable trip to Drybone whereof the editor was the hero and
something about an onthewhole very enjoyable evening in some place
that was tastefully decorated and where the visitors did justice to the
good things provided and the small hours and dancing and our host and
hostess and respected fellowtownsmen also divers young ladies sang
very nicely and a young Mr Somebody favoured the company with a comic
song

There was the same trespassing on the valuable space by the old
subscriber who said that he had said before and would say again and
he proceeded to say the same things which he said in the same paper when
we first heard our father reading it to our mother Farther on the old
subscriber proceeded to maintain and recalled attention to the fact
that it was just exactly as he had said After which he made a few
abstract incoherent remarks about the surrounding district and
concluded by stating that he must now conclude and thanking the
editor for trespassing on the aforesaid valuable space

There was the usual leader on the Government and an agitation was still
carried on by means of horriblyconstructed correspondence to both
papers for a bridge over DryHole Creek at Dustbina place where no
sane man ever had occasion to go

I took up the unreliable contemporary but found nothing there except
a letter from Parent another from Ratepayer a leader on the
Government and A Trip to Limeburn which latter I suppose was made in
opposition to the trip to Drybone

There was nothing new in the town Even the almost inevitable gang of
city spoilers hadnt arrived with the railway They would have been
a relief There was the monotonous aldermanic row and the worse than
hopeless little herd of aldermen the weird agricultural portion of whom
came in on council days in white starched and ironed coats as we had
always remembered them They were aggressively barren of ideas but
on this occasion they had risen above themselves for one of them had
remembered something his grandfather old time English alderman had
told him and they were stirring up all the old local quarrels and
family spite of the district over a motion or an amendment on a motion
that a letterfrom another enlightened body and bearing on an
equally important matter which letter had been sent through the
post sufficiently stamped delivered to the secretary handed to the
chairman read aloud in council and passed round several times for
private perusalover a motion that such letter be received

There was a maintenance case coming onto the usual wellventilated
disgust of the local religious crank who was on the jury but the case
differed in no essential point from other cases which were always coming
on and going off in my time It was not at all romantic The local youth
was not even brilliant in adultery

After I had been a week in that town the Governor decided to visit
it and preparations were made to welcome him and present him with
an address Then I thought that it was time to go and slipped away
unnoticed in the general lunacy




The NeverNever Country


 By homestead hut and shearingshed
 By railroad coach and track
 By lonely graves of our brave dead
 UpCountry and OutBack
 To where neath glorious clustered stars
 The dreamy plains expand
 My home lies wide a thousand miles
 In the NeverNever Land

 It lies beyond the farming belt
 Wide wastes of scrub and plain
 A blazing desert in the drought
 A lakeland after rain
 To the skyline sweeps the waving grass
 Or whirls the scorching sand
 A phantom land a mystic land
 The NeverNever Land

 Where lone Mount Desolation lies
 Mounts Dreadful and Despair
 Tis lost beneath the rainless skies
 In hopeless deserts there
 It spreads norwest by NoMans Land
 Where clouds are seldom seen
 To where the cattlestations lie
 Three hundred miles between

 The drovers of the Great Stock Routes
 The strange Gulf country know
 Where travelling from the southern droughts
 The big lean bullocks go
 And camped by night where plains lie wide
 Like some old oceans bed
 The watchmen in the starlight ride
 Round fifteen hundred head

 And west of named and numbered days
 The shearers walk and ride
 Jack Cornstalk and the Neerdowell
 And the greybeard side by side
 They veil their eyes from moon and stars
 And slumber on the sand
 Sad memories sleep as years go round
 In NeverNever Land

 By lonely huts northwest of Bourke
 Through years of flood and drought
 The best of English blacksheep work
 Their own salvation out
 Wild freshfaced boys grown gaunt and brown
 Stifflipped and haggardeyed
 They live the Dead Past grimly down
 Where boundaryriders ride

 The College Wreck who sunk beneath
 Then rose above his shame
 Tramps West in mateship with the man
 Who cannot write his name
 Tis there where on the barren track
 No last halfcrusts begrudged
 Where saint and sinner side by side
 Judge not and are not judged

 Oh rebels to society
 The Outcasts of the West
 Oh hopeless eyes that smile for me
 And broken hearts that jest
 The pluck to face a thousand miles
 The grit to see it through
 The communism perfected
 AndI am proud of you

 The Arab to true desert sand
 The Finn to fields of snow
 The Flaxstick turns to Maoriland
 Where the seasons come and go
 And this old fact comes home to me
 And will not let me rest
 However barren it may be
 Your own land is the best

 And lest at ease I should forget
 True mateship after all
 My waterbag and billy yet
 Are hanging on the wall
 And if my fate should show the sign
 Id tramp to sunsets grand
 With gaunt and sterneyed mates of mine
 In NeverNever Land

A Note on the Author and the Text


Henry Lawson was born near Grenfell New South Wales Australia on 17
June 1867 Although he has since become the most acclaimed Australian
writer in his own lifetime his writing was often on the sidehis
real work was whatever he could find often painting houses or
doing rough carpentry His writing was often taken from memories of his
childhood especially at PipeclayEurunderee In his autobiography he
states that many of his characters were taken from the better class of
diggers and bushmen he knew there His experiences at this time
deeply influenced his work for it is interesting to note a number of
descriptions and phrases that are identical in his autobiography and in
his stories and poems He died in Sydney 2 September 1922 Much of his
writing was for periodicals and even his regular publications were
so varied including books originally released as one volume being
reprinted as two and vice versa that the multitude of permutations
cannot be listed here However the following should give a basic
outline of his major works


 Books of Short Stories
 While the Billy Boils 1896
 On the Track 1900
 Over the Sliprails 1900
 The Country I Come From 1901  These works were first published
 Joe Wilson and His Mates 1901  in England during or shortly after
 Children of the Bush 1902  Lawsons stay there
 Send Round the Hat 1907  These two books were first published
 The Romance of the Swag 1907  as Children of the Bush
 The Rising of the Court 1910

 Poetry
 In the Days When the World Was Wide 1896
 Verses Popular and Humorous 1900
 When I Was King and Other Verses 1905
 The Skyline Riders 1910
 Selected Poems of Henry Lawson 1918


Joe Wilson and His Mates was later published as two separate volumes
Joe Wilson and Joe Wilsons Mates which correspond to Parts I  II
in Joe Wilson and His Mates This work was first published in England
which may be evident from some of Lawsons comments in the text which
are directed at English readers For example Lawson writes in The
Golden Graveyard A gold washingdish is a flat dishnearer the shape
of a bedroom bathtub than anything else I have seen in England or the
dish we used for setting milkI dont know whether the same is used
here

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

assistance they need is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms

remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
