blacking

L ANNE Everythings built on something isnt it And whats THAT

L ANNE He never says that he always says hed have done anything
for you

JAMES Wellthats the same thing

L ANNE It isntits the opposite What is class hatred James

JAMES Wisely Ah A lot o people thought when the war was over

in the papers about the wonderful unity that was comin I could ha
told em different

L ANNE Why should people hate I like everybody

JAMES You know such a lot o people dont you

L ANNE Well Daddy likes everybody and Mother likes everybody
except the people who dont like Daddy I bar Miss Stokes of

bar everybody that looks down their noses at me Out there in the
trenches thered come a shell and orfd go some orficers head an
Id think That might ha been mewere all equal in the sight o
the stars But when I got home again among the torfs I says to

youve put it on again with mufti

L ANNE James are your breeches made of mufti

in the bin close to where the taper was Its a bomb

She is about to pick it up when JAMES takes her by the waist and puts
her aside

 positions in front of the bins The voice comes nearer THE

 evening dress and in the dim light radiates a startled
 composure

regretted sometimes that I didnt have a shot at it myself
influencin other people without disclosin your identitysomething
very attractive about that Lowering his voice Between man and
man nowwhat do you think of the situation of the countrythese
processions of the unemployedthe Red Flag an the Marsillaisy in
the streetsall this talk about an upheaval

JAMES Sepulchrally Igh explosive

PRESS Taking out his notebook Too much anyway to let it drop

 A pleasant voice calls Poulder Hallo

POULDER Forming a trumpet with his hand Me Lord

 As LORD WILLIAM appears JAMES overcome by reminiscences
 salutes and is mechanically answered LORD WILLIAM has
 charm His hair and moustache are crisp and just beginning to
 grizzle His bearing is free easy and only faintly armoured
 He will go far to meet you any day He is in full evening
 dress

LORD W Cheerfully I say Poulder what have you and James been
doing to the Press Liberty of the Pressit isnt what it was but
there is a limit Where is he

 He turns to Jams between whom and himself there is still the
 freemasonry of the trenches

JAMES Pointing to POULDER Beind the parapet me Lord

 THE PRESS mopes out from where he has involuntarily been
 screened by POULDER who looks at JAMES severely LORD WILLIAM
 hides a smile

PRESS Very glad to meet you Lord William My presence down here
is quite involuntary

LORD W With a charming smile I know The Press has to put its
erto go to the bottom of everything Wheres this bomb Poulder
Ah

 He looks into the wine cooler

PRESS Taking out his notebook Could I have a word with you on
the crisis before dinner Lord William

LORD W Its time you and James were up Poulder Indicating the
cooler Look after this tell Lady William Ill be there in a
minute

POULDER Very good me Lord

 He goes followed by JAMES carrying the cooler

 As THE PRESS turns to look after them LORD WILLIAM catches
 sight of his back

LORD W I must apologise sir Can I brush you

PRESS Dusting himself Thanks its only behind He opens his
notebook Now Lord William if youd kindly outline your views on
the national situation after such a narrow escape from death I feel
they might have a moral effect My paper as you know is concerned
withthe deeper aspect of things By the way what do you value
your house and collection at

LORD W Twisting his little mustache Really I cant Really

PRESS Might I say a quarter of a millionlifted in two seconds and
a halfhundred thousand to the second It brings it home you know

LORD W No no dash it No

PRESS Disappointed I seenot draw attention to your property in
the present excited state of public feeling Well suppose we
approach it from the viewpoint of the AntiSweating dinner I have
the list of guestsvery weighty

LORD W Taken some liftingwouldnt they

PRESS Seriously May I say that you designed the dinner to soften
the tension at this crisis You saw that case I suppose this
morning of the woman dying of starvation in Bethnal Green

LORD W Desperately Yesyes Ive been horribly affected I
always knew this slump would come after the war sooner or later

PRESS Writing  had predicted slump

LORD W You see Ive been an AntiSweating man for years and I
thought if only we could come together now

PRESS Nodding I seeI see Get Society interested in the
Sweated through the dinner I have the menu here He produces it

LORD W Good God manmore than that I want to show the people
that we stand side by side with them as we did in the trenches The
whole things too jolly awful I lie awake over it

 He walks up and down

PRESS Scribbling One moment please Ill just get that down
Too jolly awfullies awake over it Was wearing a white waistcoat
with pearl buttons At a sign of resentment from his victim
I want the human touch Lord Williamits everything in my paper
What do you say about this attempt to bomb you

LORD W Well in a way I think its dd natural

PRESS Scribbling Lord William thought it dd natural

LORD W Overhearing No no dont put that down What I mean is
I should like to get hold of those fellows that are singing the
Marseillaise about the streetsfellows that have been in the war
real sports they are you knowthorough good chaps at bottomand
say to them Have a feeling heart boys put yourself in my
position I dont believe a bit theyd want to bomb me then

 He walks up and down

PRESS Scribbling and muttering The idea of brotherhood Dyou
mind my saying that Word brotherhoodalways effectivealways

 He writes

LORD E Bewildered Brotherhood Well its pure accident that
Im here and theyre there All the same I cant pretend to be
starving Cant go out into Hyde Park and stand on a tub can I
But if I could only show them what I feeltheyre such good chaps
poor devils

PRESS I quite appreciate He writes Camel and needles eye
You were at Eton and Oxford Your constituency I know Clubs But
I can get all that Is it your view that Christianity is on the
upgrade Lord William

LORD W Dubious What dyou mean by Christianitylovingkindness
and that Of course I think that dogmas got the knock

 He walks

PRESS Writing Lord William thought dogma had got the knock
I should like you just to develop your definition of Christianity
Lovingkindness strikes rather a new note

LORD W New What about the Sermon on the Mount

PRESS Writing Refers to Sermon on Mount I take it you dont
belong to any Church Lord William

LORD W Exasperated Well reallyIve been baptised and that
sort of thing But look here

PRESS Oh you can trust meI shant say anything that youll
regret Now do you consider that a religious revival would help to
quiet the country

LORD W Well I think it would be a deuced good thing if everybody
were a bit more kind

PRESS Ah Musing I feel that your views are strikingly
original Lord William If you could just open out on them a little
more How far would you apply kindness in practice

LORD W Can you apply it in theory

PRESS I believe it is done But would you allow yourself to be
blown up with impunity

LORD W Well thats a bit extreme But I quite sympathise with
this chap Imagine yourself in his shoes He sees a huge house all
these bottles us swilling them down perhaps hes got a starving
wife or consumptive kids

PRESS Writing and murmuring Umm Kids

LORD W He thinks But for the grace of God there swill I Why
should that blighter have everything and I nothing and all that

PRESS Writing And all that Eagerly Yes

LORD W And graduallyyou seethis contrastbecomes an obsession
with him Theres got to be an example made he thinks ander
he makes it dont you know

PRESS Writing Yees Andwhen youre the example

LORD W Well you feel a bit blue of course But my point is that
you quite see it

PRESS From the other world Do you believe in a future life Lord
William The public took a lot of interest in the question if you
remember at the time of the war It might revive at any moment if
theres to be a revolution

LORD W The wish is always father to the thought isnt it

PRESS Yes Buterdoesnt the question of a future life rather
bear on your point about kindness If there isnt onewhy be kind

LORD W Well I should say one oughtnt to be kind for any motive
thats selfinterest but just because one feels it dont you know

PRESS Writing vigorously Thats very newvery new

LORD W Simply You chaps are wonderful

PRESS Doubtfully You mean werewere

LORD W No really You have such a dd hard time It must be
perfectly beastly to interview fellows like me

PRESS Oh Not at all Lord William Not at all I assure you
compared with a literary man itsits almost heavenly

LORD W You must have a wonderful knowledge of things

PRESS Bridling a little WellI shouldnt say that

LORD W I dont see how you can avoid it You turn your hands to
everything

PRESS Modestly Wellyes Yes

LORD W I say Is there really going to be a revolution or are you
making it up you Press

PRESS We dont know We never know whether we come before the
event or it comes before us

LORD W Thatsvery deepvery dip Dyou mind lending me your
notebook a moment Id like to stick that down All right Ill
use the other end THE PRESS hands it hypnotically

LORD W Jotting Thanks awfully Now whats your real opinion of
the situation

PRESS As a man or a Press man

LORD W Is there any difference

PRESS Is there any connection

LORD W Well as a man

PRESS As a man I think its rotten

LORD W Jotting Rotten And as a pressman

PRESS Smiling Prime

LORD W What Like a Stilton cheese Ha ha

 He is about to write

PRESS My stunt Lord William You said that

 He jots it on his cuff

LORD W But look here Would you say that a strong press movement
would help to quiet the country

PRESS Well as you ask me Lord William Ill tell you No
newspapers for a month would do the trick

LORD W Jotting By Jove Thats brilliant

PRESS Yes but I should starve He suddenly looks up and his
eyes like gimlets bore their way into LORD WILLIAMS pleasant
troubled face Lord William you could do me a real kindness
Authorise me to go and interview the fellow who left the bomb here
Ive got his address I promise you to do it most discreetly Fact
iswellIm in low water Since the war we simply cant get
sensation enough for the new taste Now if I could have an article
headed Bombed and Bombersort of double interview you know itd
very likely set me on my legs again Very earnestly Look
He holds out his frayed wristbands

LORD W Grasping his hand My dear chap certainly Go and
interview this blighter and then bring him round here You can do
that for one Id very much like to see him as a matter of fact

PRESS Thanks awfully I shall never forget it Oh might I have
my notebook

 LORD WILLIAM hands it back

LORD W And look here if theres anythingwhen a fellows
fortunate and anothers not

He puts his hand into his breast pocket

PRESS Oh thank you But you see I shall have to write you up a
bit Lord William The old aristocracyyou know what the public
still expects if you were to lend me money you might feel

LORD W By Jove Never should have dreamt

PRESS No But it wouldnt do Have you a photograph of yourself

LORD W Not on me

PRESS Pity By the way has it occurred to you that there may be
another bomb on the premises

LORD W Phew Ill have a look

 He looks at his watch and begins hurriedly searching the bins
 bending down and going on his knees THE PRESS reverses the
 notebook again and sketches him

PRESS To himself Ah Thatll do Lord William examines the
foundations of his house

 A voice calls Bill THE PRESS snaps the notebook to and
 looks up There where the communication trench runs in
 stands a tall and elegant woman in the extreme of evening
 dress

 With presence of mind Lady William Youll find Lord William
Oh Have you a photograph of him

LADY W Not on me

PRESS Eyeing her ErnoI suppose notno Excuse me He
sidles past her and is gone

LADY W With lifted eyebrows Bill

LORD W Emerging dusting his knees Hallo Nell I was just
making sure there wasnt another bomb

LADY W Yes thats why I came dawn Who was that person

LORD W Press

LADY W He looked awfully yellow I hope you havent been giving
yourself away

LORD W Dubiously Well I dont know Theyre like corkscrews

LADY W What did he ask you

LORD W What didnt he

LADY W Well what did you tell him

LORD W That Id been baptisedbut he promised not to put it down

LADY W Bill you are absurd

 She gives a light tittle laugh

LORD W I dont remember anything else except that it was quite
natural we should be bombed dont you know

LADY W Why what harm have we done

LORD W Been born my dear Suddenly serious I say Nell how am
I to tell what this fellow felt when he left that bomb here

LADY W Why do you want to

LORD W Out there one used to know what ones men felt

LADY W Staring My dear boy I really dont think you ought to
see the Press it always upsets you

LORD W Well Why should you and I be going to eat ourselves silly
to improve the condition of the sweated when

LADY W Calmly When theyre going to improve ours if we dont
look out Weve got to get in first Bill

LORD W Gloomily I know Its all fear Thats it Here we

They stand about a yard apart and banding their faces towards each
other kiss on the lips

L ANNE Appearing suddenly from the communication trench and
tiptoeing silently between them Oh Mum You and Daddy ARE
wasting time Dinners ready you know


 CURTAIN




ACT II

 The single room of old MRS LEMMY in a small grey house in
 Bethnal Green the room of one cumbered by little save age and
 the crockery debris of the past A bed a cupboard a coloured
 portrait of Queen Victoria andof all thingsa fiddle
 hanging on the wall By the side of old MRS LEMMY in her chair
 is a pile of corduroy trousers her days sweated sewing and a
 small table She sits with her back to the window through
 which in the last of the light the opposite side of the little
 grey street is visible under the evening sky where hangs one
 white cloud shaped like a horned beast She is still sewing
 and her lips move Being old and lonely she has that habit of
 talking to herself distressing to those who cannot overhear
 From the smack of her tongue she was once a West Country cottage
 woman from the look of her creased parchmenty face she was
 once a pretty girl with black eyes in which there is still much
 vitality The door is opened with difficulty and a little girl
 enters carrying a pile of unfinished corduroy trousers nearly
 as large as herself She puts them down against the wall and
 advances She is eleven or twelve years old largeeyed dark
 haired and sallow Half a woman of this and half of another
 world except when as now she is as irresponsible a bit of life
 as a little flowering weed growing out of a wall She stands
 looking at MRS LEMMY with dancing eyes

L AIDA Ive brought yer tomorrers trahsers Ynt yer finished
