Foreword



 Ive tinkered at my bits of rhymes
 In weary woeful waiting times
 In doleful hours of battledin
 Ere yet they brought the wounded in
 Through vigils of the fateful night
 In lousy barns by candlelight
 In dugouts sagging and aflood
 On stretchers stiff and bleared with blood
 By ragged grove by ruined road
 By hearths accurst where Love abode
 By broken altars blackened shrines
 Ive tinkered at my bits of rhymes

 Ive solaced me with scraps of song
 The desolated ways along
 Through sickly fields all shrapnelsown
 And meadows reaped by death alone
 By blazing cross and splintered spire
 By headless Virgin in the mire
 By gardens gashed amid their bloom
 By gutted grave by shattered tomb
 Beside the dying and the dead
 Where rocket green and rocket red
 In trembling pools of poising light
 With flowers of flame festoon the night
 Ah me by what dark ways of wrong
 Ive cheered my heart with scraps of song

 So heres my sheaf of warwon verse
 And some is bad and some is worse
 And if at times I curse a bit
 You neednt read that part of it
 For through it all like horror runs
 The red resentment of the guns
 And you yourself would mutter when
 You took the things that once were men
 And sped them through that zone of hate
 To where the dripping surgeons wait
 And wonder too if in Gods sight
 War ever ever can be right

 Yet may it not be crime and war
 But effort misdirected are
 And if theres good in war and crime
 There may be in my bits of rhyme
 My songs from out the slaughter mill
 So take or leave them as you will




The Call

 France August first 1914



 Far and near high and clear
 Hark to the call of War
 Over the gorse and the golden dells
 Ringing and swinging of clamorous bells
 Praying and saying of wild farewells
 War War War

 High and low all must go
 Hark to the shout of War
 Leave to the women the harvest yield
 Gird ye men for the sinister field
 A sabre instead of a scythe to wield
 War Red War

 Rich and poor lord and boor
 Hark to the blast of War
 Tinker and tailor and millionaire
 Actor in triumph and priest in prayer
 Comrades now in the hell out there
 Sweep to the fire of War

 Prince and page sot and sage
 Hark to the roar of War
 Poet professor and circus clown
 Chimneysweeper and fop o the town
 Into the pot and be melted down
 Into the pot of War

 Women all hear the call
 The pitiless call of War
 Look your last on your dearest ones
 Brothers and husbands fathers sons
 Swift they go to the ravenous guns
 The gluttonous guns of War

 Everywhere thrill the air
 The maniac bells of War
 There will be little of sleeping tonight
 There will be wailing and weeping tonight
 Deaths red sickle is reaping tonight
 War War War




The Fool



 But it isnt playing the game he said
 And he slammed his books away
 The Latin and Greek Ive got in my head
 Will do for a duller day
 Rubbish I cried The bugles call
 Isnt for lads from school
 Dye think hed listen Oh not at all
 So I called him a fool a fool

 Now theres his dog by his empty bed
 And the flute he used to play
 And his favourite bat    but Dick hes dead
 Somewhere in France they say
 Dick with his rapture of song and sun
 Dick of the yellow hair
 Dicky whose life had but begun
 Carrioncold out there

 Look at his prizes all in a row
 Surely a hint of fame
 Now hes finished withnothing to show
 Doesnt it seem a shame
 Look from the window All you see
 Was to be his one day
 Forest and furrow lawn and lea
 And he goes and chucks it away

 Chucks it away to die in the dark
 Somebody saw him fall
 Part of him mud part of him blood
 The rest of himnot at all
 And yet Ill bet he was never afraid
 And he went as the best of em go
 For his hand was clenched on his broken blade
 And his face was turned to the foe

 And I called him a fool    oh how blind was I
 And the cup of my griefs abrim
 Will Glory o England ever die
 So long as weve lads like him
 So long as weve fond and fearless fools
 Who spurning fortune and fame
 Turn out with the rallying cry of their schools
 Just bent on playing the game

 A fool Ah no He was more than wise
 His was the proudest part
 He died with the glory of faith in his eyes
 And the glory of love in his heart
 And though theres never a grave to tell
 Nor a cross to mark his fall
 Thank God we know that he batted well
 In the last great Game of all




The Volunteer



 Sez I My Country calls Well let it call
 I grins perlitely and declines wiv thanks
 Go let em plaster every blighted wall
 Eres _ONE_ they dont stampede into the ranks
 Them politicians with their greasy ways
 Them empiregrabbersfight for em No fear
 Ive seen this mess acomin from the days
 Of Algyserious and Aggydear
 Ive felt me passion rise and swell
 But    wot the ell Bill Wot the ell

 Sez I My Country Mine I likes their cheek
 Me mudbespattered by the cars they drive
 Wot makes my measly thirty bob a week
 And sweats red blood to keep meself alive
 Fight for the right to slave that they may spend
 Them in their mansions me ere in my slum
 No let em fight wots something to defend
 But me Ive nothinlet the Kaiser come
 And so I cusses ard and well
 But    wot the ell Bill Wot the ell

 Sez I If they would do the decent thing
 And shield the missis and the little uns
 Why even _I_ might shout God save the King
 And face the chances of them ungry guns
 But weve got three another on the way
 Its that wot makes me snarl and set me jor
 The wife and nippers wot of em I say
 If I gets knocked out in this blasted war
 Gets proper busted by a shell
 But    wot the ell Bill Wot the ell

 Ay wot the ells the use of all this talk
 Today some boys in blue was passin me
 And some of em they ad no legs to walk
 And some of em they ad no eyes to see
 Andwell I couldnt look em in the face
 And so Im goin goin to declare
 Im under fortyone and take me place
 To face the music with the bunch out there
 A fool you say Maybe youre right
 Ill ave no peace unless I fight
 Ive ceased to think I only know
 Ive gotta go Bill gotta go




The Convalescent



    So I walked among the willows very quietly all night
 There was no moon at all at all no timid star alight
 There was no light at all at all I wint from tree to tree
 And I called him as his mother called but he nivver answered me

 Oh I called him all the nighttime as I walked the wood alone
 And I listened and I listened but I nivver heard a moan
 Then I found him at the dawnin when the sorry sky was red
 I was lookin for the livin but I only found the dead

 Sure I know that it was Shamus by the silver cross he wore
 But the bugles they were callin and I heard the cannon roar
 Oh I had no time to tarry so I said a little prayer
 And I clasped his hands together and I left him lyin there

 Now the birds are singin singin and Im home in Donegal
 And its Springtime and Im thinkin that I only dreamed it all
 I dreamed about that evil wood all crowded with its dead
 Where I knelt beside me brother when the battledawn was red

 Where I prayed beside me brother ere I wint to fight anew
 Such dreams as these are evil dreams I cant believe its true
 Where all is love and laughter sure its hard to think of loss   
 But mothers sayin nothin and she clasps_A SILVER CROSS_




The Man from Athabaska



 Oh the wife she tried to tell me that twas nothing but the thrumming
 Of a woodpecker arapping on the hollow of a tree
 And she thought that I was fooling when I said it was the drumming
 Of the mustering of legions and twas calling unto me
 Twas calling me to pull my freight and hop across the sea

 And amending of my fishnets sure I started up in wonder
 For I heard a savage roaring and twas coming from afar
 Oh the wife she tried to tell me that twas only summer thunder
 And she laughed a bit sarcastic when I told her it was War
 Twas the chariots of battle where the mighty armies are

 Then down the lake came Halfbreed Tom with russet sail aflying
 And the word he said was War again so what was I to do
 Oh the dogs they took to howling and the missis took to crying
 As I flung my silver foxes in the little birch canoe
 Yes the old girl stood ablubbing till an island hid the view

 Says the factor Mike youre crazy They have soldier men aplenty
 Youre as grizzled as a badger and youre sixty year or so
 But I havent missed a scrap says I since I was one and twenty
 And shall I miss the biggest You can bet your whiskersno
 So I sold my furs and started    and thats eighteen months ago

 For I joined the Foreign Legion and they put me for a starter
 In the trenches of the Argonne with the Boche a step away
 And the partner on my right hand was an apache from Montmartre
 On my left there was a millionaire from Pittsburg U S A
 Poor fellow They collected him in bits the other day

 But Im sprier than a chipmunk save a touch of the lumbago
 And they calls me Old Methoosalah and blagues me all the day
 Im their exhibition sniper and they work me like a Dago
 And laugh to see me plug a Boche a half a mile away
 Oh I hold the highest record in the regiment they say

 And at night they gather round me and I tell them of my roaming
 In the Country of the Crepuscule beside the Frozen Sea
 Where the muskox runs unchallenged and the cariboo goes homing
 And they sit like little children just as quiet as can be
 Men of every crime and colour how they harken unto me

 And I tell them of the Furland of the tumpline and the paddle
 Of secret rivers loitering that no one will explore
 And I tell them of the ranges of the packstrap and the saddle
 And they fill their pipes in silence and their eyes beseech for more
 While above the starshells fizzle and the high explosives roar

 And I tell of lakes fishhaunted where the big bull moose are calling
 And forests still as sepulchres with never trail or track
 And valleys packed with purple gloom and mountain peaks appalling
 And I tell them of my cabin on the shore at Fond du Lac
 And I find myself athinking Sure I wish that I was back

 So I brag of bear and beaver while the batteries are roaring
 And the fellows on the firing steps are blazing at the foe
 And I yarn of fur and feather when the marmites are asoaring
 And they listen to my stories seven poilus in a row
 Seven lean and lousy poilus with their cigarettes aglow

 And I tell them when its over how Ill hike for Athabaska
 And those seven greasy poilus they are crazy to go too
 And Ill give the wife the pickletub I promised and Ill ask her
 The price of mink and marten and the run of cariboo
 And Ill get my traps in order and Ill start to work anew

 For Ive had my fill of fighting and Ive seen a nation scattered
 And an army swung to slaughter and a river red with gore
 And a city all asmoulder and    as if it really mattered
 For the lake is yonder dreaming and my cabins on the shore
 And the dogs are leaping madly and the wife is singing gladly
 And Ill rest in Athabaska and Ill leave it nevermore




The Red Retreat


 _Tramp tramp the grim road the road from Mons to Wipers
 Ive ammered out this ditty with me bruised and bleedin feet
 Tramp tramp the dim roadwe didnt ave no pipers
 And bellies that was oller was the drums we ad to beat
 Tramp tramp the bad road the bits o kiddies cryin there
 The fell birds aflyin there the ouses all aflame
 Tramp tramp the sad road the pals I left alyin there
 Red there and dead there    Oh blimy its a shame_

 Asingin Oos Yer Lady Friend we started out from Arver
 Asingin till our froats was drywe didnt care a ang
 The Frenchies ow they lined the way and slung us their palaver
 And all we knowed to arnser was the one word vang
 They gave us booze and caporal and cheered for us like crazy
 And all the pretty gels was out to kiss us as we passed
 And ow they all went dotty when we owled the Marcelaisey
 Oh Gawd Them was the appy days the days too good to last

 We started out for God Knows Where we started out aroarin
 We ollered Ere We Are Again and struth but we was dry
 The dust was gummin up our ears and ow the sweat was pourin
 The road was long the sun was like a brazier in the sky
 We wondered where the Uns waswe wasnt long awonderin
 For down a scruff of illside they rushes like a flood
 Then oh twas music eavenly our batteries athunderin
 And arms and legs went soarin in the fountain of their blood

 For on they came like beeswarms ahochin and asingin
 We pumped the bullets into em we couldnt miss a shot
 But though we mowed em down like grass like grass was they aspringin
 And all our ands was blistered for our rifles was so ot
 We roared with battlefury and we lammed the stuffin out of em
 And then we fixed our baynets and we spitted em like meat
 You should ave eard the beggars squeal
 you should ave seen the rout of em
 And ow we cussed and wondered when the word came Retreat

 Retreat That was the ell of it It fair upset our abits
 Arunnin from them blighters over alf the roads of France
 Ascurryin before em like a lot of blurry rabbits
 And knowin we could smash em if we just ad alf a chance
 Retreat That was the bitter bit alimpin and ablunderin
 All day and night ahoofin it and sleepin on our feet
 Afightin rear guard actions for a bit o rest and wonderin
 If sugar beets or mangels was the olesomest to eat

 Ho yus there isnt many left that started out so cheerily
 There was no bands aplayin and we ad no autmobeels
 Our tummies they was oller and our eads was angin wearily
 And if we stopped to light a fag the Uns was on our eels
 That rotten road I cant forget the kids and mothers flyin there
 The bits of barns ablazin and the orrid sights I sor
 The stiffs that lined the wayside me own pals alyin there
 Their faces covered over wiv a little eap of stror

 _Tramp tramp the red road the wicked bullets ummin
 Ive panted out this ditty with me ot ard breath
 Tramp tramp the dread road the Boches all acomin
 The lootin and the shootin and the shrieks o death
 Tramp tramp the fell road the mad orde pursuin there
 And ow we urled it back again them grim grey waves
 Tramp tramp the ell road the orror and the ruin there
 The graves of me mateys there the grim sour graves_




The Haggis of Private McPhee



 Hae ye heard whit ma auld mithers postit tae me
 It fair maks me hamesick says Private McPhee
 And whit did she send ye says Private McPhun
 As he cockit his rifle and bleezed at a Hun
 A haggis A _HAGGIS_ says Private McPhee
 The brawest big haggis I ever did see
 And think its the morn when fond memory turns
 Tae haggis and whuskeythe Birthday o Burns
 We maun find a dram then well ca in the rest
 O the lads and well hae a Burns Nicht wi the best

 Be ready at sundoon snapped Sergeant McCole
 I want you two men for the Listnin Patrol
 Then Private McPhee looked at Private McPhun
 Im thinkin ma lad were confoundedly done
 Then Private McPhun looked at Private McPhee
 Im thinkin auld chap its a aff wi oor spree
 But up spoke their crony wee Wullie McNair
 Jist lea yer braw haggis for me tae prepare
 And as for the dram if I search the camp roun
 We maun hae a drappie tae jist haud it doon
 Sae rin lads and think though the nicht it be black
 O the haggis thats waitin ye when ye get back

 My but it wis waesome on Naebuddys Land
 And the deid they were rottin on every hand
 And the rockets like corpse candles hauntit the sky
 And the winds o destruction went shudderin by
 There wis skelpin o bullets and skirlin o shells
 And breengin o bombs and a thoosand deathknells
 But cooryin doon in a Jack Johnson hole
 Little fashed the twa men o the Listnin Patrol
 For sweeter than honey and bricht as a gem
 Wis the thocht o the haggis that waitit for them

 Yet alas in oor moments o sunniest cheer
 Calamitys aften maist cruelly near
 And while the twa talked o their puddin divine
 The Boches below them were howkin a mine
 And while the twa cracked o the feast they would hae
 The fuse it wis burnin and burnin away
 Then sudden a roar like the thunner o doom
 A hellleap o flame    then the wheesht o the tomb

 Haw Jock Are ye hurtit says Private McPhun
 Ay Geordie theyve got me Im fearin Im done
 Its ma leg Im jist thinkin its aff at the knee
 Yed best gang and leave me says Private McPhee
 Oh leave ye I wunna says Private McPhun
 And leave ye I canna for though I micht run
 Its no faur I wud gang its no muckle Id see
 Im blindit and thats whits the maitter wi me
 Then Private McPhee sadly shakit his heid
 If we bide here for lang well be bidin for deid
 And yet Geordie lad I could gang weel content
 If Id tasted that haggis ma auld mither sent
 Thats droll says McPhun yeve jist speakit ma mind
 Oh I ken its a terrible thing tae be blind
 And yet its no that that embitters ma lot
 Its missin that braw muckle haggis yeve got
 For a while they were silent then up once again
 Spoke Private McPhee though he whussilt wi pain
 And why should we miss it Between you and me
 Weve legs for tae run and weve eyes for tae see
 You lend me your shanks and Ill lend you ma sicht
 And well baith hae a kytefu o haggis the nicht

 Oh the sky it wis dourlike and dreepin a wee
 When Private McPhun gruppit Private McPhee
 Oh the glaur it wis fylin and crieshin the grun
 When Private McPhee guidit Private McPhun
 Keep clear o them corpsestheyre maybe no deid
 Haud on Theres a big muckle crater aheid
 Look oot Theres a sap well be haein a coup
 A staurshell For Godsake Doun lad on yer daup
 Bear aff tae yer richt    Aw yer jist daein fine
 Before the nichts feenished on haggis well dine

 There wis death and destruction on every hand
 There wis havoc and horror on Naebuddys Land
 And the shells bickered doun wi a crump and a glare
 And the hameless wee bullets were dingin the air
 Yet on they went staggerin cooryin doun
 When the stutter and cluck o a Maxim crept roun
 And the legs o McPhun they were sturdy and stoot
 And McPhee on his back kept a bonnie lookoot
 On on ma brave lad Were no faur frae the goal
 I can hear the braw sweerin o Sergeant McCole

 But strength has its leemit and Private McPhun
 Wi a sab and a curse fell his length on the grun
 Then Private McPhee shoutit doon in his ear
 Jist think o the haggis I smell it from here
 Its gushin wi juice its embaumin the air
 Its steamin for us and werejistabootthere
 Then Private McPhun answers Dommit auld chap
 For the sake o that haggis Ill gang till I drap
 And he gets on his feet wi a heave and a strain
 And onward he staggers in passion and pain
 And the flare and the glare and the fury increase
 Till youd think theyd jist taken a hell on a lease
 And on they go reelin in peetifu plight
 And someone is shoutin away on their right
 And someone is runnin and noo they can hear
 A sound like a prayer and a sound like a cheer
 And swift through the crash and the flash and the din
 The lads o the Hielands are bringin them in

 Theyre baith sairly woundit but is it no droll
 Hoo they rave aboot haggis says Sergeant McCole
 When hirplin alang comes wee Wullie McNair
 And they a wonnert why he wis greetin sae sair
 And he says Id jist liftit it oot o the pot
 And there it lay steamin and savoury hot
 When sudden I dooked at the fleech o a shell
 And it_DRAPPED ON THE HAGGIS AND DINGED IT TAE HELL_

 And oh but the lads were fair taken aback
 Then sudden the order wis passed tae attack
 And up from the trenches like lions they leapt
 And on through the nicht like a torrent they swept
 On on wi their bayonets thirstin before
 On on tae the foe wi a rush and a roar
 And wild to the welkin their battlecry rang
 And doon on the Boches like tigers they sprang
 And there wisna a man but had death in his ee
 For he thocht o the haggis o Private McPhee




The Lark



 From wrathred dawn to wrathred dawn
 The guns have brayed without abate
 And now the sick sun looks upon
 The bleared bloodboltered fields of hate
 As if it loathed to rise again
 How strange the hush Yet sudden hark
 From yon downtrodden gold of grain
 The leaping rapture of a lark

 A fusillade of melody
 That sprays us from yon trench of sky
 A new amazing enemy
 We cannot silence though we try
 A battery on radiant wings
 That from yon gap of golden fleece
 Hurls at us hopes of such strange things
 As joy and home and love and peace

 Pure heart of song do you not know
 That we are making earth a hell
 Or is it that you try to show
 Life still is joy and all is well
 Brave little wings Ah not in vain
 You beat into that bit of blue
 Lo we who pant in wars red rain
 Lift shining eyes see Heaven too




The Odyssey of Erbert Iggins



 Me and Ed and a stretcher
 Out on the nootral ground
 If theres one dead corpse Ill betcher
 Theres a undred smellin around
 Me and Eddie OBrian
 Both of the R A M C
 Its a ell of a night
 For a soul to take flight
 As Eddie remarks to me
 Me and Ed crawlin omeward
 Thinkin our job is done
 When sudden and clear
 Wot do we ear
 Owl of a wounded Un

 Got to take im snaps Eddy
 Got to take all we can
 E may be a Germ
 Wiv the eart of a worm
 But blarst im aint e a man
 So e sloshes out fixin a dressin
 Ed always a medical knack
 When that wounded Un
 E rolls to is gun
 And e plugs me pal in the back

 Now what would you do I arst you
 There was me slaughtered mate
 There was that Un
 Id collered is gun
 Asnarlin is ymn of ate
 Wot did I do Ere whisper   
 Ed a shiny bald top to is ead
 But when I got through
 Between me and you
 It was orrid and jaggy and red

 Ang on like a limpet Eddy
 Thank Gord you aint dead after all
 Its slow and its sure and its steady
 Which is ard for es big and Im small
 The rockets are shootin and shinin
 Its rainin a perishin flood
 The bullets are buzzin and whinin
 And Im up to me stern in the mud
 Theres all kinds of owlin and ootin
 Its black as a bucket of tar
 Oh Im doin my bit
 But Im avin a fit
 And I wish I was ome wiv Mar

 Stick on like a plaster Eddy
 Old sport youre aslackin your grip
 Gord But Im crocky already
 My feet ow they slither and slip
 There goes the biff of a bullet
 The Boches have got us for fair
 Another one_WHUT_
 The son of a slut
 E managed to miss by a air
 Ow Wot was it jabbed at me shoulder
 Gave it a dooce of a wrench
 Is it Eddy or me
 Wots ableedin so free
 Crust but its long to the trench
 I aint just as strong as a Sandow
 And Ed aint a flapper by far
 Im blamed if I understand ow
 Weve managed to get where we are
 But eres for a bit of a breather
 Steady there Ed arf a mo
 Old pal its all right
 Its a ell of a fight
 But are we downearted Nooo

 Now war is a funny thing aint it
 Its the rummiest sort of a go
 For when its most real
 Its then that you feel
 Youre awatchin a cinema show
 Eres me wots a barbers assistant
 Hey presto Its somewheres in France
 And Im ere in a pit
 Where a coalbox as it
 And its all like a giddy romance
 The ruddy quickfirers are spittin
 The eavies are bellowin ate
 And ere I am cashooly sittin
 And oldin the ead of me mate
 Them gharstly green starshells is beamin
 Ot shrapnel is poppin like rain
 And Im sayin Bert Iggins youre dreamin
 And youll wake up in Ampstead again
 Youll wake up and ear yourself sayin
 Would you like sir to ave a shampoo
 Stead of sheddin yer blood
 In the rain and the mud
 Which is someow the right thing to do
 Which is someow yer oaryeyed dooty
 Wot youre doin the best wot you can
 For Ampstead and ome and beauty
 And youve been and youve slaughtered a man
 A feller wot punctured your partner
 Oh you ammered im ard on the ead
 And you still see is eyes
 Starin bang at the skies
 And you aint even sorry es dead
 But you wish you was back in your diggins
 Asleep on your mouldy old stror
 Oh youre doin yer bit Erbert Iggins
 But you aint just enjoyin the war

 Ang on like a hoctopus Eddy
 Its us for the bombbelt again
 Except for the shrap
 Which as it me a tap
 Im feelin as right as the rain
 Its my silly old feet wot are slippin
 Its as dark as a ogsead o sin
 But dont be oneasy my pippin
 Im goin to pilot you in
 Its my silly old ead wot is reelin
 The bullets is buzzin like bees
 Me shoulders redot
 And Im bleedin a lot
 And me legs is oninged at the knees
 But were staggerin nearer and nearer
 Just stick it old sport play the game
 I make em out clearer and clearer
 Our trenches asnappin with flame
 Oh were stumblin closer and closer
 Ang on there lad Just one more try
 Did you say Put you down Damn it no sir
 Ill carry you in if I die
 By cracky old feller theyve seen us
 Theyre sendin out stretchers for two
 Lets give em the hoorah between us
 Anged lucky we arent booked through
 My flipper is mashed to a jelly
 A bullet as tickled your spleen
 Weve shed lots of gore
 And were leakin some more
 Butwot a hoccasion its been
 Ho Ere comes the rescuin party
 Theyre crawlin out cautious and slow
 Come Buck up and greet em my earty
 Shoulder to shoulderso
 They mustnt think we was downearted
 Old pal we was never downearted
 If they arsts us if we was downearted
 Well owl in their fyces Nooo




A Song of Winter Weather



 It isnt the foe that we fear
 It isnt the bullets that whine
 It isnt the business career
 Of a shell or the bust of a mine
 It isnt the snipers who seek
 To nip our young hopes in the bud
 No it isnt the guns
 And it isnt the Huns
 Its the MUD
 MUD
 MUD

 It isnt the melee we mind
 That often is rather good fun
 It isnt the shrapnel we find
 Obtrusive when rained by the ton
 It isnt the bounce of the bombs
 That gives us a positive pain
 Its the strafing we get
 When the weather is wet
 Its the RAIN
 RAIN
 RAIN

 It isnt because we lack grit
 We shrink from the horrors of war
 We dont mind the battle a bit
 In fact that is what we are for
 It isnt the rumjars and things
 Make us wish we were back in the fold
 Its the fingers that freeze
 In the boreal breeze
 Its the COLD
 COLD
 COLD

 Oh the rain the mud and the cold
 The cold the mud and the rain
 With weather at zero its hard for a hero
 From language thats rude to refrain
 With porridgy muck to the knees
 With sky thats apouring a flood
 Sure the worst of our foes
 Are the pains and the woes
 Of the RAIN
 the COLD
 and the MUD




Tipperary Days



 Oh werent they the fine boys You never saw the beat of them
 Singing all together with their throats bronzebare
 Fightingfit and mirthmad music in the feet of them
 Swinging on to glory and the wrath out there
 Laughing by and chaffing by frolic in the smiles of them
 On the road the white road all the afternoon
 Strangers in a strange land miles and miles and miles of them
 Battlebound and hearthigh and singing this tune

 _Its a long way to Tipperary
 Its a long way to go
 Its a long way to Tipperary
 And the sweetest girl I know
 Goodbye Piccadilly
 Farewell Lester Square
 Its a long long way to Tipperary
 But my hearts right there_

 Come Yvonne and Juliette Come Mimi and cheer for them
 Throw them flowers and kisses as they pass you by
 Arent they the lovely lads Havent you a tear for them
 Going out so gallantly to dare and die
 What is it theyre singing so Some high hymn of Motherland
 Some immortal chanson of their Faith and King
 Marseillaise or Brabancon anthem of that other land
 Dears let us remember it that song they sing

 _Cest un chemin long to Tepararee
 Cest un chemin long cest vrai
 Cest un chemin long to Tepararee
 Et la belle fille quje connais
 Bonjour Peekadeely
 Au revoir Lestaire Squaire
 Cest un chemin long to Tepararee
 Mais mon coeur ees zaire_

 The gallant old Contemptibles There isnt much remains of them
 So full of fun and fitness and asinging in their pride
 For some are cold as clabber and the corby picks the brains of them
 And some are back in Blighty and awishing they had died
 And yet it seems but yesterday that great glad sight of them
 Swinging on to battle as the sky grew black and black
 But oh their glee and glory and the great grim fight of them
 Just whistle Tipperary and it all comes back

 _Its a long way to Tipperary
 Which means ome anywhere
 Its a long way to Tipperary
 And the things wot make you care
 Goodbye Piccadilly
 Ow I opes my folks is well
 Its a long long way to Tipperary
 R Aint War just ell_




Fleurette

 The Wounded Canadian Speaks



 My leg Its off at the knee
 Do I miss it Well some You see
 Ive had it since I was born
 And lately a devilish corn
 I rather chuckle with glee
 To think how Ive fooled that corn

 But Ill hobble around all right
 It isnt that its my face
 Oh I know Im a hideous sight
 Hardly a thing in place
 Sort of gargoyle youd say
 Nurse wont give me a glass
 But I see the folks as they pass
 Shudder and turn away
 Turn away in distress   
 Mirror enough I guess

 Im gay You bet I _am_ gay
 But I wasnt a while ago
 If youd seen me even today
 The darndest picture of woe
 With this Caliban mug of mine
 So ravaged and raw and red
 Turned to the wallin fine
 Wishing that I was dead   
 What has happened since then
 Since I lay with my face to the wall
 The most despairing of men
 Listen Ill tell you all

 That poilu across the way
 With the shrapnel wound in his head
 Has a sister she came today
 To sit awhile by his bed
 All morning I heard him fret
 Oh when will she come Fleurette

 Then sudden a joyous cry
 The tripping of little feet
 The softest tenderest sigh
 A voice so fresh and sweet
 Clear as a silver bell
 Fresh as the morning dews
 Cest toi cest toi Marcel
 Mon frere comme je suis heureuse

 So over the blankets rim
 I raised my terrible face
 And I sawhow I envied him
 A girl of such delicate grace
 Sixteen all laughter and love
 As gay as a linnet and yet
 As tenderly sweet as a dove
 Half woman half childFleurette

 Then I turned to the wall again
 I was awfully blue you see
 And I thought with a bitter pain
 Such visions are not for me
 So there like a log I lay
 All hidden I thought from view
 When sudden I heard her say
 Ah Who is that malheureux
 Then briefly I heard him tell
 However he came to know
 How Id smothered a bomb that fell
 Into the trench and so
 None of my men were hit
 Though it busted me up a bit

 Well I didnt quiver an eye
 And he chattered and there she sat
 And I fancied I heard her sigh
 But I wouldnt just swear to that
 And maybe she wasnt so bright
 Though she talked in a merry strain
 And I closed my eyes ever so tight
 Yet I saw her ever so plain
 Her dear little tilted nose
 Her delicate dimpled chin
 Her mouth like a budding rose
 And the glistening pearls within
 Her eyes like the violet
 Such a rare little queenFleurette

 And at last when she rose to go
 The light was a little dim
 And I ventured to peep and so
 I saw her graceful and slim
 And she kissed him and kissed him and oh
 How I envied and envied him

 So when she was gone I said
 In rather a dreary voice
 To him of the opposite bed
 Ah friend how you must rejoice
 But me Im a thing of dread
 For me nevermore the bliss
 The thrill of a womans kiss

 Then I stopped for lo she was there
 And a great light shone in her eyes
 And me I could only stare
 I was taken so by surprise
 When gently she bent her head
 May I kiss you Sergeant she said

 Then she kissed my burning lips
 With her mouth like a scented flower
 And I thrilled to the fingertips
 And I hadnt even the power
 To say God bless you dear
 And I felt such a precious tear
 Fall on my withered cheek
 And darn it I couldnt speak

 And so she went sadly away
 And I knew that my eyes were wet
 Ah not to my dying day
 Will I forget forget
 Can you wonder now I am gay
 God bless her that little Fleurette




Funk



 When your marrer bone seems oller
 And youre glad you aint no taller
 And youre all ashakin like you ad the chills
 When your skin creeps like a pullets
 And youre duckin all the bullets
 And youre green as gorgonzola round the gills
 When your legs seem made of jelly
 And youre squeamish in the belly
 And you want to turn about and do a bunk
 For Gawds sake kid dont show it
 Dont let your mateys know it
 Youre just sufferin from funk funk funk

 Of course theres no denyin
 That it aint so easy tryin
 To grin and grip your rifle by the butt
 When the ole world rips asunder
 And you sees yer pal go under
 As a bunch of shrapnel sprays im on the nut
 I admit its ard contrivin
 When you ears the shells arrivin
 To discover youre a bloomin bit o spunk
 But my lad youve got to do it
 And your God will see you through it
 For wot E ates is funk funk funk

 So stand up son look gritty
 And just um a lively ditty
 And only be afraid to be afraid
 Just old yer rifle steady
 And ave yer baynit ready
 For thats the way good soldiermen is made
 And if you as to die
 As it sometimes appens why
 Far better die a ero than a skunk
 Adoin of yer bit
 And soto ell with it
 There aint no bloomin funk funk funk




Our Hero



 Flowers only flowersbring me dainty posies
 Blossoms for forgetfulness that was all he said
 So we sacked our gardens violets and roses
 Lilies white and bluebells laid we on his bed
 Soft his pale hands touched them tenderly caressing
 Soft into his tired eyes came a little light
 Such a wistful lovelook gentle as a blessing
 There amid the flowers waited he the night

 I would have you raise me I can see the West then
 I would see the sun set once before I go
 So he lay agazing seemed to be at rest then
 Quiet as a spirit in the golden glow
 So he lay awatching rosy castles crumbling
 Moats of blinding amber bastions of flame
 Rugged rifts of opal crimson turrets tumbling
 So he lay adreaming till the shadows came

 Open wide the window theres a lark asinging
 Theres a glad lark singing in the evening sky
 How its wild with rapture radiantly winging
 Oh its good to hear that when one has to die
 I am horrorhaunted from the hell they found me
 I am battlebroken all I want is rest
 Ah Its good to die so blossoms all around me
 And a kind lark singing in the golden West

 Flowers song and sunshine just one thing is wanting
 Just the happy laughter of a little child
 So we brought our dearest Doris allenchanting
 Tenderly he kissed her radiant he smiled
 In the golden peacetime you will tell the story
 How for you and yours sweet bitter deaths were ours   
 God bless little children So he passed to glory
 So we left him sleeping still amid the flowrs




My Mate



 Ive been sittin starin starin at is muddy pair of boots
 And tryin to convince meself its im
 Look out there lad That sniperes a dysey when e shoots
 Ell be layin of you out the same as Jim
 Jim as lies there in the dugout wiv is blanket round is ead
 To keep is brains from mixin wiv the mud
 And is face as white as putty and is overcoat all red
 Like es spilt a bloomin paintpotbut its blood

 And Im tryin to remember of a time we wasnt pals
 Ow often weve played ookey im and me
 And sometimes it was musicalls and sometimes it was gals
 And even there we ad no disagree
 For when e copped Mariar Jones the one I liked the best
 I shook is and and loaned im arf a quid
 I saw im through the parsons job I elped im make is nest
 I even stood godfarther to the kid

 So when the war broke out sez e Well wot abaht it Joe
 Well wot abaht it lad sez I to im
 Is missis made a awful fuss but e was mad to go
 E always was ighsperrited was Jim
 Well none of its been eaven and the most of its been ell
 But weve shared our baccy and weve alved our bread
 Wed all the luck at Wipers and we shaved through Noove Chapelle
 And    that snipin barstard gits im on the ead

 Now wot I wants to know is why it wasnt me was took
 Ive only got meself e stands for three
 Im plainer than a louse while e was andsome as a dook
 E always _was_ a better man than me
 E was goin ome next Toosday e was appy as a lark
 And ed just received a letter from is kid
 And e struck a match to show me as we stood there in the dark
 When    that bleedin bullet got im on the lid

 E was killed so awful sudden that e adnt time to die
 E sorto jumped and came down wiv a thud
 Them corpsylookin starshells kept astreamin in the sky
 And there e lay like nothin in the mud
 And there e lay so quiet wiv no mansard to is ead
 And Im sick and blamed if I can understand
 The pots of alf and alf weve ad and _ZIP_ like thates dead
 Wiv the letter of is nipper in is and

 Theres some as fights for freedom and theres some as fights for fun
 But me my lad I fights for bleedin ate
 You can blame the war and blast it but I opes it wont be done
 Till I gets the bloomin bloodprice for me mate
 Itll take a bit o bayonet to level up for Jim
 Then if Im spared I think Ill ave a bid
 Wiv er that was Mariar Jones to take the place of im
 To sorter be a farther to is kid




Milking Time



 Theres a drip of honeysuckle in the deep green lane
 Theres old Martin jogging homeward on his worn old wain
 There are cherry petals falling and a cuckoo calling calling
 And a score of larks God bless em    but its all pain pain
 For you see I am not really there at all not at all
 For you see Im in the trenches where the crumpcrumps fall
 And the bits o shells are screaming and its only blessed dreaming
 That in fancy I am seeming back in old Saint Pol

 Oh Ive thought of it so often since Ive come down here
 And I never dreamt that any place could be so dear
 The silvered whinstone houses and the rosy men in blouses
 And the kindly whitecapped women with their eyes springclear
 And mothers sitting knitting where her roses climb
 And the angelus is calling with a soft soft chime
 And the seawind comes caressing and the lights a golden blessing
 And Yvonne Yvonne is guessing that its milking time

 Oh its Sunday for shes wearing of her broidered gown
 And she draws the pasture pickets and the cows come down
 And their feet are powdered yellow and their voices honeymellow
 And they bring a scent of clover and their eyes are brown
 And Yvonne is dreaming after but her eyes are blue
 And her lips are made for laughter and her white teeth too
 And her mouth is like a cherry and a dimple mocking merry
 Is lurking in the very cheek she turns to you

 So I walk beside her kindly and she laughs at me
 And I heap her arms with lilac from the lilac tree
 And a golden light is welling and a golden peace is dwelling
 And a thousand birds are telling how its good to be
 And what are pouting lips for if they cant be kissed
 And Ive filled her arms with blossom so she cant resist
 And the cows are sadly straying and her mother must be saying
 That Yvonne is long delaying    _GOD HOW CLOSE THAT MISSED_

 A nice polite reminder that the Boche are nigh
 That were here to fight like devils and if needbe die
 That from kissing pretty wenches to the frantic firingbenches
 Of the battered tattered trenches is a far far cry
 Yet still Im sitting dreaming in the glare and grime
 And once again Im hearing of them churchbells chime
 And how I wonder whether in the golden summer weather
 We will fetch the cows together when its milking time   
 English voice months later
 _OW BILL A ROTTIN FRENCHY WHEW E AINT ARF PRIME_




Young Fellow My Lad



 Where are you going Young Fellow My Lad
 On this glittering morn of May
 Im going to join the Colours Dad
 Theyre looking for men they say
 But youre only a boy Young Fellow My Lad
 You arent obliged to go
 Im seventeen and a quarter Dad
 And ever so strong you know

     

 So youre off to France Young Fellow My Lad
 And youre looking so fit and bright
 Im terribly sorry to leave you Dad
 But I feel that Im doing right
 God bless you and keep you Young Fellow My Lad
 Youre all of my life you know
 Dont worry Ill soon be back dear Dad
 And Im awfully proud to go

     

 Why dont you write Young Fellow My Lad
 I watch for the post each day
 And I miss you so and Im awfully sad
 And its months since you went away
 And Ive had the fire in the parlour lit
 And Im keeping it burning bright
 Till my boy comes home and here I sit
 Into the quiet night

     

 What is the matter Young Fellow My Lad
 No letter again today
 Why did the postman look so sad
 And sigh as he turned away
 I hear them tell that weve gained new ground
 But a terrible price weve paid
 God grant my boy that youre safe and sound
 But oh Im afraid afraid

     

 Theyve told me the truth Young Fellow My Lad
 Youll never come back again
 _OH GOD THE DREAMS AND THE DREAMS IVE HAD
 AND THE HOPES IVE NURSED IN VAIN_
 For you passed in the night Young Fellow My Lad
 And you proved in the cruel test
 Of the screaming shell and the battle hell
 That my boy was one of the best

 So youll live youll live Young Fellow My Lad
 In the gleam of the evening star
 In the woodnote wild and the laugh of the child
 In all sweet things that are
 And youll never die my wonderful boy
 While life is noble and true
 For all our beauty and hope and joy
 We will owe to our lads like you




A Song of the Sandbags



 No Bill Im not aspooning out no patriotic tosh
 The cove beind the sandbags aint a deathorglory cuss
 And though I strafes em good and ard I doesnt ate the Boche
 I guess theyre mostly decent just the same as most of us
 I guess they loves their omes and kids as much as you or me
 And just the same as you or me theyd rather shake than fight
 And if wed appened to be born at BerlinontheSpree
 Wed be out there with Ans and Fritz dead sure that we was right

 Astandin up to the sandbags
 Its funny the thoughts wot come
 Starin into the darkness
 Earin the bullets um
 _ZING ZIP PING RIP
 ARK OW THE BULLETS UM_
 Aleanin against the sandbags
 Wiv me rifle under me ear
 Oh Ive ad more thoughts on a sentrygo
 Than I used to ave in a year

 I wonder Bill if Ans and Fritz is wonderin like me
 Wots at the bottom of it all Wot all the slaughters for
 E thinks es right of course e aint but this we both agree
 If them as made it ad to fight there wouldnt be no war
 If them as lies in feather beds while we kips in the mud
 If them as makes their fortoons while we fights for em like ell
 If them as slings their pot of ink just ad to sling their blood
 By Crust Im thinkin there ud be another tale to tell

 Shiverin up to the sandbags
 With a hicicle stead of a spine
 Dont it seem funny the things you think
 Ere in the firin line
 _WHEE WHUT ZIZ ZUT
 LORD OW THE BULLETS WHINE_
 Hunkerin down when a starshell
 Cracks in a sputter of light
 You can jaw to yer soul by the sandbags
 Most any old time o night

 They talks o Englands glory and aoldin of our trade
 Of Empire and igh destiny until were fair flimflammed
 But if its for the likes o that that bloody war is made
 Then wot I say is Empire and igh destiny be damned
 Theres only one good cause Bill for poor blokes like us to fight
 Thats selfdefence for earth and ome and them that bears our name
 And thats wot Im adoin by the sandbags ere tonight   
 But Fritz out there will tell you es adoin of the same

 Starin over the sandbags
 Sick of the ole damn thing
 Firin to keep meself awake
 Earin the bullets sing
 _HISS TWANG TSING PANG
 SAUCY THE BULLETS SING_
 Dreamin ere by the sandbags
 Of a day when war will cease
 When Ans and Fritz and Bill and me
 Will clink our mugs in fraternity
 And the Brotherhood of Labour will be
 The Brotherhood of Peace




On the Wire



 O God take the sun from the sky
 Its burning me scorching me up
 God cant You hear my cry
 Water A poor little cup
 Its laughing the cursed sun
 See how it swells and swells
 Fierce as a hundred hells
 God will it never have done
 Its searing the flesh on my bones
 Its beating with hammers red
 My eyeballs into my head
 Its parching my very moans
 See Its the size of the sky
 And the sky is a torrent of fire
 Foaming on me as I lie
 Here on the wire    the wire   

 Of the thousands that wheeze and hum
 Heedlessly over my head
 Why cant a bullet come
 Pierce to my brain instead
 Blacken forever my brain
 Finish forever my pain
 Here in the hellish glare
 Why must I suffer so
 Is it God doesnt care
 Is it God doesnt know
 Oh to be killed outright
 Clean in the clash of the fight
 That is a golden death
 That is a boon but this   
 Drawing an anguished breath
 Under a hot abyss
 Under a stooping sky
 Of seething sulphurous fire
 Scorching me up as I lie
 Here on the wire    the wire   

 Hasten O God Thy night
 Hide from my eyes the sight
 Of the body I stare and see
 Shattered so hideously
 I cant believe that its mine
 My body was white and sweet
 Flawless and fair and fine
 Shapely from head to feet
 Oh no I can never be
 The thing of horror I see
 Under the rifle fire
 Trussed on the wire    the wire   

 Of night and of death I dream
 Night that will bring me peace
 Coolness and starry gleam
 Stillness and deaths release
 Ages and ages have passed
 Lo it is night at last
 Night but the guns roar out
 Night but the hosts attack
 Red and yellow and black
 Geysers of doom upspout
 Silver and green and red
 Starshells hover and spread
 Yonder off to the right
 Fiercely kindles the fight
 Roaring near and more near
 Thundering now in my ear
 Close to me close    Oh hark
 Someone moans in the dark
 I hear but I cannot see
 I hear as the rest retire
 Someone is caught like me
 Caught on the wire    the wire   

 Again the shuddering dawn
 Weird and wicked and wan
 Again and Ive not yet gone
 The man whom I heard is dead
 Now I can understand
 A bullet hole in his head
 A pistol gripped in his hand
 Well he knew what to do
 Yes and now I know too   

 Hark the resentful guns
 Oh how thankful am I
 To think my beloved ones
 Will never know how I die
 Ive suffered more than my share
 Im shattered beyond repair
 Ive fought like a man the fight
 And now I demand the right
 God how his fingers cling
 To do without shame this thing
 Good theres a bullet still
 Now Im ready to fire
 Blame me God if You will
 Here on the wire    the wire   




Bills Grave



 Im gatherin flowers by the wayside to lay on the grave of Bill
 Ive sneaked away from the billet cause Jim wouldnt understand
 Ed call me a silly fatead and larf till it made im ill
 To see me ere in the cornfield wiv a big bookay in me and

 For Jim and me we are rough uns but Bill was one o the best
 We listed and learned together to larf at the wust wot comes
 Then Bill copped a packet proper and took is departure West
 So sudden e adnt a minit to say goodbye to is chums

 And they took me to where e was planted a sort of a measly mound
 And thinks I ow Bill would be tickled bein so soft and queer
 If I gathered a bunch o them wildflowers and sort of arranged them round
 Like a kind of a bloody headpiece    and thats the reason Im ere

 But not for the love of glory I wouldnt ave Jim to know
 Ed call me a slobberin Cissy and larf till is sides was sore
 Id ave larfed at meself too it isnt so long ago
 But someow it changes a feller avin a taste o war

 It elps a man to be elpful to know wot is pals is worth
 Them golden poppies is blazin like lamps some fairy as lit
 Im fond o them big white dysies    Now Jims o the salt o the earth
 But e as got a tongue wots a terror and e aint sentimental a bit

 I likes them blue chaps wots idin so shylike among the corn
 Wont Bill be glad We was allus thicker n thieves us three
 Why Oos that singin so earty _JIM_ And as sure as Im born
 Es there in the giddy cornfields agatherin flowers like me

 Quick Drop me posy beind me I watches im for a while
 Then I says Wot o there Chummy Wot price the little bookay
 And e starts like a bloke wots guilty and e says with a sheepish smile
 Shes a bit of orl right the widder wot keeps the estaminay

 So e goes away in a urry and I wishes im best o luck
 And I picks up me bunch o wildflowers and the lights gettin sorto dim
 When I makes me way to the boneyard
 and    I stares like a man wots stuck
 For wot do I see _BILLS GRAVEMOUND STREWN WITH THE FLOWERS OF JIM_

 Of course I wont never tell im bein a tactical lad
 And Jim parleyvoos to the widder Trez beans lamoor compree
 Oh ed die of shame if e knew I knew but say wont Bill be glad
 When e stares through the bleedin clods and sees
 the blossoms of Jim and me




Jean Desprez



 Oh ye whose hearts are resonant and ring to Wars romance
 Hear ye the story of a boy a peasant boy of France
 A lad uncouth and warped with toil yet who when trial came
 Could feel within his soul upleap and soar the sacred flame
 Could stand upright and scorn and smite as only heroes may
 Oh harken Let me try to tell the tale of Jean Desprez

 With fire and sword the Teuton horde was ravaging the land
 And there was darkness and despair grim death on every hand
 Red fields of slaughter sloping down to ruins black abyss
 The wolves of war ran evilfanged and little did they miss
 And on they came with fear and flame to burn and loot and slay
 Until they reached the redroofed croft the home of Jean Desprez

 Rout out the village one and all the Uhlan Captain said
 Behold Some hand has fired a shot My trumpeter is dead
 Now shall they Prussian vengeance know now shall they rue the day
 For by this sacred German slain ten of these dogs shall pay
 They drove the cowering peasants forth women and babes and men
 And from the last with many a jeer the Captain chose he ten
 Ten simple peasants bowed with toil they stood they knew not why
 Against the grey wall of the church hearing their children cry
 Hearing their wives and mothers wail with faces dazed they stood
 A moment only    _READY FIRE_ They weltered in their blood

 But there was one who gazed unseen who heard the frenzied cries
 Who saw these men in sabots fall before their childrens eyes
 A Zouave wounded in a ditch and knowing death was nigh
 He laughed with joy Ah here is where I settle ere I die
 He clutched his rifle once again and long he aimed and well   
 A shot Beside his victims ten the Uhlan Captain fell

 They dragged the wounded Zouave out their rage was like a flame
 With bayonets they pinned him down until their Major came
 A blonde fullblooded man he was and arrogant of eye
 He stared to see with shattered skull his favourite Captain lie
 Nay do not finish him so quick this foreign swine he cried
 Go nail him to the big church door he shall be crucified

 With bayonets through hands and feet they nailed the Zouave there
 And there was anguish in his eyes and horror in his stare
 Water A single drop he moaned but how they jeered at him
 And mocked him with an empty cup and saw his sight grow dim
 And as in agony of death with blood his lips were wet
 The Prussian Major gaily laughed and lit a cigarette

 But mid the whitefaced villagers who cowered in horror by
 Was one who saw the woeful sight who heard the woeful cry
 Water One little drop I beg For love of Christ who died   
 It was the little Jean Desprez who turned and stole aside
 It was the little barefoot boy who came with cup abrim
 And walked up to the dying man and gave the drink to him

 A roar of rage They seize the boy they tear him fast away
 The Prussian Major swings around no longer is he gay
 His teeth are wolfishly agleam his face all dark with spite
 Go shoot the brat he snarls that dare defy our Prussian might
 Yet stay I have another thought Ill kindly be and spare
 Quick give the lad a rifle charged and set him squarely there
 And bid him shoot and shoot to kill Haste Make him understand
 The dying dog he fain would save shall perish by his hand
 And all his kindred they shall see and all shall curse his name
 Who bought his life at such a cost the price of death and shame

 They brought the boy wildeyed with fear they made him understand
 They stood him by the dying man a rifle in his hand
 Make haste said they the time is short and you must kill or die
 The Major puffed his cigarette amusement in his eye
 And then the dying Zouave heard and raised his weary head
 Shoot son twill be the best for both shoot swift and straight he said
 Fire first and last and do not flinch for lost to hope am I
 And I will murmur _VIVE LA FRANCE_ and bless you ere I die

 Halfblind with blows the boy stood there he seemed to swoon and sway
 Then in that moment woke the soul of little Jean Desprez
 He saw the woods go sheening down the larks were singing clear
 And oh the scents and sounds of spring how sweet they were how dear
 He felt the scent of newmown hay a soft breeze fanned his brow
 O God the paths of peace and toil How precious were they now
 The summer days and summer ways how bright with hope and bliss
 The autumn such a dream of gold    and all must end in this
 This shining rifle in his hand that shambles all around
 The Zouave there with dying glare the blood upon the ground
 The brutal faces round him ringed the evil eyes aflame
 That Prussian bully standing by as if he watched a game
 Make haste and shoot the Major sneered a minute more I give
 A minute more to kill your friend if you yourself would live

 They only saw a barefoot boy with blanched and twitching face
 They did not see within his eyes the glory of his race
 The glory of a million men who for fair France have died
 The splendour of selfsacrifice that will not be denied
 Yet    he was but a peasant lad and oh but life was sweet   
 Your minutes nearly gone my lad he heard a voice repeat
 Shoot Shoot the dying Zouave moaned Shoot Shoot the soldiers said
 Then Jean Desprez reached out and shot    _THE PRUSSIAN MAJOR DEAD_

 But Cheese and Crust Im crazy now Ive done me little stunt
 To sniff the air of Blighty in the mawnin

 Ive looked on cider flowin till it fairly turned me ead
 But oh the finest scoff will be when all is done and said

 And there be furrin gels to kiss and scented furrin wine
 But theres no land like England and no other gel like mine
 Thank Gawd for dear old Blighty in the mawnin




Cocotte



 When a girls sixteen and as poor as shes pretty
 And she hasnt a friend and she hasnt a home
 Heighho Shes as safe in Paris city
 As a lamb nightstrayed where the wild wolves roam
 And that was I oh its seven years now
 Some waters run down the Seine since then
 And Ive almost forgotten the pangs and the tears now
 And Ive almost taken the measure of men

 Oh I found me a lover who loved me only
 Artist and poet and almost a boy
 And my heart was bruised and my life was lonely
 And him I adored with a wonderful joy
 If hed come to me with his pockets empty
 How wed have laughed in a garret gay
 But he was rich and in radiant plenty
 We lived in a villa at Viroflay

 Then came the War and of bliss bereft me
 Then came the call and he went away
 All that he had in the world he left me
 With the rosewreathed villa at Viroflay
 Then came the news and the tragic story
 My hero my splendid lover was dead
 Sword in hand on the field of glory
 And he died with my name on his lips they said

 So here am I in my widows mourning
 The weeds Ive really no right to wear
 And women fix me with eyes of scorning
 Call me cocotte but I do not care
 And men look at me with eyes that borrow
 The brightness of love but I turn away
 Alone say I I will live with Sorrow
 In my little villa at Viroflay

 And lo Im living alone with Pity
 And they say that pity from loves not far
 Let me tell you all last week in the city
 I took the metro at Saint Lazare
 And the carriage was crowded to overflowing
 And when there entered at Chateaudun
 Two wounded poilus with medals showing
 I eagerly gave my seat to one

 You should have seen them theyd slipped deaths clutches
 But sadder a sight you will rarely find
 One had a leg off and walked on crutches
 The other a bit of a boy was blind
 And they both sat down and the lad was trying
 To grope his way as a blind man tries
 And half of the women around were crying
 And some of the men had tears in their eyes

 How he stirred me this blind boy clinging
 Just like a child to his crippled chum
 But I did not cry Oh no a singing
 Came to my heart for a year so dumb
 Then I knew that at threeandtwenty
 There is wonderful work to be done
 Comfort and kindness and joy in plenty
 Peace and light and love to be won

 Oh thought I could mine eyes be given
 To one who will live in the dark alway
 To love and to servetwould make life Heaven
 Here in my villa at Viroflay
 So I left my poilus and now you wonder
 Why today I am so elate   
 Look In the glory of sunshine yonder
 Theyre bringing my blind boy in at the gate




My Baynit



 When first I left Blighty they gave me a baynit
 And told me it ad to be smothered wiv gore
 But blimey I avent been able to stain it
 So far as Ive gone wiv the vintage of war
 For aint it a fraud when a Boche and yours truly
 Gits into a mix in the grit and the grime
 E jerks up is ands wiv a yell and es duly
 Part of me outfit every time

 Left right Hans and Fritz
 Goose step keep up yer mits
 Oh my Aint it a shyme
 Part of me outfit every time

 At toasting a biscuit me baynits a dandy
 Ive used it to open a bully beef can
 For pokin the fire it comes in werry andy
 For any old thing but for stickin a man

 Extended like monkeys wots tryin to climb
 And I uses me baynitto slit their suspenders
 Part of me outfit every time

 Four Uns lor wot a bag
 Ere Fritz sample a fag
 Oh my aint it a gyme

Carry On



 Its easy to fight when everythings right
 And youre mad with the thrill and the glory
 Its easy to cheer when victorys near
 And wallow in fields that are gory
 Its a different song when everythings wrong
 When youre feeling infernally mortal
 When its ten against one and hope there is none
 Buck up little soldier and chortle

 Carry on Carry on
 There isnt much punch in your blow
 Youre glaring and staring and hitting out blind
 Youre muddy and bloody but never you mind
 Carry on Carry on
 You havent the ghost of a show
 Its looking like death but while youve a breath
 Carry on my son Carry on

 And so in the strife of the battle of life
 Its easy to fight when youre winning
 Its easy to slave and starve and be brave
 When the dawn of success is beginning
 But the man who can meet despair and defeat
 With a cheer theres the man of Gods choosing
 The man who can fight to Heavens own height
 Is the man who can fight when hes losing

 Carry on Carry on
 Things never were looming so black
 But show that you havent a cowardly streak
 And though youre unlucky you never are weak
 Carry on Carry on
 Brace up for another attack
 Its looking like hell butyou never can tell
 Carry on old man Carry on

 There are some who drift out in the deserts of doubt
 And some who in brutishness wallow
 There are others I know who in piety go
 Because of a Heaven to follow
 But to labour with zest and to give of your best
 For the sweetness and joy of the giving
 To help folks along with a hand and a song
 Why theres the real sunshine of living

 Carry on Carry on
 Fight the good fight and true
 Believe in your mission greet life with a cheer
 Theres big work to do and thats why you are here
 Carry on Carry on
 Let the world be the better for you
 And at last when you die let this be your cry
 _CARRY ON MY SOUL CARRY ON_




Over the Parapet



 All day long when the shells sail over
 I stand at the sandbags and take my chance
 But at night at night Im a reckless rover
 And over the parapet gleams Romance
 Romance Romance How Ive dreamed it writing
 Dreary old records of money and mart
 Me with my head chuckful of fighting
 And the blood of vikings to thrill my heart

 But little I thought that my time was coming
 Sudden and splendid supreme and soon
 And here I am with the bullets humming
 As I crawl and I curse the light of the moon
 Out alone for adventure thirsting
 Out in mysterious No Mans Land
 Prone with the dead when a starshell bursting
 Flares on the horrors on every hand
 There are ruby stars and they drip and wiggle
 And the grasses gleam in a light bloodred
 There are emerald stars and their tails they wriggle
 And ghastly they glare on the face of the dead
 But the worst of all are the stars of whiteness
 That spill in a pool of pearly flame
 Pretty as gems in their silver brightness
 And etching a man for a bullets aim

 Yet oh its great to be here with danger
 Here in the weird deathpregnant dark
 In the devils pasture a stealthy ranger
 When the moon is decently hiding Hark
 What was that Was it just the shiver
 Of an eerie wind or a clammy hand
 The rustle of grass or the passing quiver
 Of one of the ghosts of No Mans Land

 Its only at night when the ghosts awaken
 And gibber and whisper horrible things
 For to every foot of this Godforsaken
 Zone of jeopard some horror clings
 Ugh What was that It felt like a jelly
 That flattish mound in the noisome grass
 You three big rats running free of its belly
 Out of my way and let me pass

 But if theres horror theres beauty wonder
 The trench lights gleam and the rockets play
 That flood of magnificent orange yonder
 Is a battery blazing miles away
 With a rush and a singing a great shell passes
 The rifles resentfully bicker and brawl
 And here I crouch in the dewdrenched grasses
 And look and listen and love it all

 God What a life But I must make haste now
 Before the shadow of night be spent
 Its little the time there is to waste now
 If Id do the job for which I was sent
 My bombs are right and my clippers ready
 And I wriggle out to the chosen place
 When I hear a rustle    Steady    Steady
 Who am I staring slap in the face

 There in the dark I can hear him breathing
 A foot away and as still as death
 And my heart beats hard and my brain is seething
 And I know hes a Hun by the smell of his breath
 Then Will you surrender I whisper hoarsely
 For its death swift death to utter a cry
 English schweinhund he murmurs coarsely
 Then well fight it out in the dark say I

 So we grip and we slip and we trip and wrestle
 There in the gutter of No Mans Land
 And I feel my nails in his windpipe nestle
 And he tries to gouge but I bite his hand
 And he tries to squeal but I squeeze him tighter
 Now I say I can kill you fine
 But tell me first you Teutonic blighter
 Have you any children He answers Nein

 _NINE_ Well I cannot kill such a father
 So I tie his hands and I leave him there
 Do I finish my little job Well rather
 And I get home safe with some light to spare
 Heighho by day its just prosy duty
 Doing the same old song and dance
 But oh with the nightjoy glory beauty
 Over the parapetLife Romance




The Ballad of Soulful Sam



 You want me to tell you a story a yarn of the firin line
 Of our thin red kharki eroes out there where the bullets whine
 Out there where the bombs are bustin
 and the cannons like elldoors slam
 Just order another drink boys and Ill tell you of Soulful Sam

 Oh Sam he was never ilarious though Ive ad some mates as was wus
 He adnt C B on his programme he never was known to cuss
 For a card or a skirt or a beermug he adnt a friendly word
 But when it came down to Scriptures say Wasnt he just a bird

 He always ad tracts in his pocket the which he would haste to present
 And though the fellers would use them in ways that they never was meant
 I used to read em religious and frequent Ive been impressed
 By some of them bundles of oly dope he carried around in his vest

 For Iand oh ow I shudder at the orror the word conveys
 Ave beenlet me whisper it oarselya gambler alf of me days
 A gambler you eara gambler It makes me wishful to weep
 And yet ow its true my brethrenId rather gamble than sleep

 Ive gambled the ole world over from Monte Carlo to Maine
 From Dawson City to Dover from San Francisco to Spain
 Cards They ave been me ruin Theyve taken me pride and me pelf
 And when Id no one to play withwhy Id go and Id play by meself

 And Sam e would sit and watch me as I shuffled a greasy deck
 And ed say Youre bound to Perdition
 And Id answer Git off me neck
 And thats ow we came to get friendly though built on a different plan
 Me wots a desprite gambler im sich a good young man

 But on to me tale Just imagine    Darkness The battlefront
 The furious Uns attackin Us ones abearin the brunt
 Me crouchin beind a sandbag tryin ard to keep calm
 When I ears someone singin a ymn toon beold it is Soulful Sam

 Yes right in the crash of the combat in the fury of flash and flame
 E was shootin and singin serenely as if e enjoyed the same
 And there in the eat of the battle as the ordes of demons attacked
 He dipped down into is tunic and e anded me out a tract

 Then a starshell flared and I read it Oh Flee From the Wrath to Come
 Nice cheerful subject I tell yer when youre earin the bullets um
 And before I ad time to thank im just one of them bits of lead
 Comes slingin along in a urry and it its my partner    Dead

 No siree not by a long sight For it plugged im ard on the chest
 Just where ed tracts for a army corps stowed away in is vest
 On its mission of death that bullet ustled along and it caved
 A ole in them tracts to is ide boysbut the life o me pal was saved

 And there as e showed me in triumph and orror was chokin me breath
 On came another bullet on its orrible mission of death
 On through the night it cavorted seekin its aven of rest
 And it zipped through a crack in the sandbags
 and it wolloped me bang on the breast

 Was I killed do you ask Oh no boys Why am I sittin ere
 Gazin with mournful vision at a mug long empty of beer
 With a throat as dry as aoh thanky I dont much mind if I do
 Beer with a dash of ollands thats my particular brew

 Yes that was a terrible moment It ammered me ard oer the eart
 It bowled me down like a ninepin and I looked for the gore to start
 And I saw in the flash of a moment in that thunder of hate and strife
 Me wretched past like a pitchurthe sins of a gamblers life

 For I ad no tracts to save me to thwart that mad missiles doom
 I ad no pious pamphlets to elp me to cheat the tomb
 I ad no oly leaflets to baffle a bullets aim
 Id onlya deck of cards boys but    _IT SEEMED TO DO JUST THE SAME_




Only a Boche



 We brought him in from between the lines wed better have let him lie
 For whats the use of risking ones skin for a _TYKE_ thats going to die
 Whats the use of tearing him loose under a gruelling fire
 When hes shot in the head and worse than dead
 and all messed up on the wire

 However I say we brought him in _DIABLE_ The mud was bad
 The trench was crooked and greasy and high and oh what a time we had
 And often we slipped and often we tripped but never he made a moan
 And how we were wet with blood and with sweat
 but we carried him in like our own

 Now there he lies in the dugout dim awaiting the ambulance
 And the doctor shrugs his shoulders at him
 and remarks He hasnt a chance
 And we squat and smoke at our game of bridge
 on the glistening strawpacked floor
 And above our oaths we can hear his breath deepdrawn in a kind of snore

 For the dressing station is long and low and the candles gutter dim
 And the mean light falls on the cold clay walls
 and our faces bristly and grim
 And we flap our cards on the lousy straw and we laugh and jibe as we play
 And youd never know that the cursed foe was less than a mile away
 As we con our cards in the rancid gloom oppressed by that snoring breath
 Youd never dream that our broad roofbeam was swept by the broom of death

 Heighho My turn for the dummy hand I rise and I stretch a bit
 The fetid air is making me yawn and my cigarettes unlit
 So I go to the nearest candle flame and the man we brought is there
 And his face is white in the shabby light and I stand at his feet and stare
 Stand for a while and quietly stare for strange though it seems to be
 The dying Boche on the stretcher there has a queer resemblance to me

 It gives one a kind of a turn you know to come on a thing like that
 Its just as if I were lying there with a turban of blood for a hat
 Lying there in a coat greygreen instead of a coat greyblue
 With one of my eyes all shot away and my brain half tumbling through
 Lying there with a chest that heaves like a bellows up and down
 And a cheek as white as snow on a grave and lips that are coffee brown

 And confound him too He wears like me on his finger a wedding ring
 And around his neck as around my own by a greasy bit of string
 A locket hangs with a womans face and I turn it about to see
 Just as I thought    on the other side the faces of children three
 Clustered together cherublike three little laughing girls
 With the usual tiny rosebud mouths and the usual silken curls
 Zut I say He has beaten me for me I have only two
 And I push the locket beneath his shirt feeling a little blue

 Oh it isnt cheerful to see a man the marvellous work of God
 Crushed in the mutilation mill crushed to a smeary clod
 Oh it isnt cheerful to hear him moan but it isnt that I mind
 It isnt the anguish that goes with him its the anguish he leaves behind
 For his going opens a tragic door that gives on a world of pain
 And the death he dies those who live and love will die again and again

 So here I am at my cards once more but its kind of spoiling my play
 Thinking of those three brats of his so many a mile away
 War is war and hes only a Boche and we all of us take our chance
 But all the same Ill be mighty glad when Im hearing the ambulance
 One foe the less but all the same Im heartily glad Im not
 The man who gave him his broken head the sniper who fired the shot

 No trumps you make it I think you said Youll pardon me if I err
 For a moment I thought of other things   
 _MON DIEU QUELLE VACHE DE GUERRE_




Pilgrims



 For oh when the war will be over
 Well go and well look for our dead
 Well go when the bees on the clover
 And the plume of the poppy is red
 Well go when the years at its gayest
 When meadows are laughing with flowrs
 And there where the crosses are greyest
 Well seek for the cross that is ours

 For they cry to us Friends we are lonely
 Aweary the night and the day
 But come in the blossomtime only
 Come when our graves will be gay
 When daffodils all are ablowing
 And larks are athrilling the skies
 Oh come with the hearts of you glowing
 And the joy of the Spring in your eyes

 But never oh never come sighing
 For ours was the Splendid Release
 And oh but twas joy in the dying
 To know we were winning you Peace
 So come when the valleys are sheening
 And fledged with the promise of grain
 And here where our graves will be greening
 Just smile and be happy again

 And so when the war will be over
 Well seek for the Wonderful One
 And maiden will look for her lover
 And mother will look for her son
 And there will be end to our grieving
 And gladness will gleam over loss
 Asglory beyond all believing
 We point    to a name on a cross

Tricolour



 _POPPIES_ you try to tell me glowing there in the wheat
 Poppies Ah no You mock me Its blood I tell you its blood
 Its gleaming wet in the grasses its glistning warm in the wheat
 It dabbles the ferns and the clover it brims in an angry flood
 It leaps to the startled heavens it smothers the sun it cries
 With scarlet voices of triumph from blossom and bough and blade
 See the bright horror of it Its roaring out of the skies
 And the whole red world is awelter    Oh God Im afraid Im afraid

 _CORNFLOWERS_ you say just cornflowers gemming the golden grain
 Ah no You cant deceive me Cant I believe my eyes
 Look Its the dead my comrades stark on the dreadful plain
 All in their darkblue blouses staring up at the skies
 Comrades of canteen laughter dumb in the yellow wheat
 See how they sprawl and huddle See how their brows are white
 Goaded on to the shambles there in death and defeat   
 Father of Pity hide them Hasten O God Thy night

 _LILIES_ the light is waning only lilies you say
 Nestling and softly shining there where the speargrass waves
 No my friend I know better brighter I see than day
 Its the poor little wooden crosses over their quiet graves
 Oh how theyre gleaming gleaming See Each cross has a crown
 Yes its true I am dying little will be the loss   
 Darkness    but look In Heaven a light and its shining down   
 Gods accolade Lift me up friends Im going to win_MY CROSS_




A Pot of Tea



 You make it in your messtin by the braziers rosy gleam
 You watch it cloud then settle amber clear
 You lift it with your baynit and you sniff the fragrant steam
 The very breath of it is ripe with cheer
 Youre awful cold and dirty and acursin of your lot
 You scoff the blushin alf of it so rich and rippin ot
 It bucks you up like anythink just seems to touch the spot
 God bless the man that first discovered Tea

 Since I came out to fight in France which aint the other day
 I think Ive drunk enough to float a barge
 All kinds of fancy foreign dope from caffy and doo lay
 To rum they serves you out before a charge
 In back rooms of estaminays Ive gurgled pints of cham
 Ive swilled down mugs of cider till Ive felt a bloomin dam
 But struth they all aint in it with the vintage of Assam
 God bless the man that first invented Tea

 I think them lazy lumps o gods wot kips on asphodel
 Swigs nectar thats a flavour of Oolong
 I only wish them sons o guns agrillin down in ell
 Could ave their daily ration of Suchong
 Hurrah Im off to battle which is ell and eaven too
 And if I dont give some poor bloke a sextons job to do
 Tonight by Fritzs campfire wont I ave a gorgeous brew
 For fightin mustnt interfere with Tea
 Tonight well all be tellin of the Boches that we slew
 As we drink the giddy victory in Tea




The Revelation



 _The same old sprint in the morning boys to the same old din and smut
 Chained all day to the same old desk down in the same old rut
 Posting the same old greasy books catching the same old train
 Oh how will I manage to stick it all if I ever get back again_

 Weve bidden goodbye to life in a cage were finished with pushing a pen
 Theyre pumping us full of bellicose rage theyre showing us how to be men
 Were only beginning to find ourselves were wonders of brawn and thew
 But when we go back to our Sissy jobsoh what are we going to do

 For shoulders curved with the counter stoop will be carried erect and square
 And faces white from the office light will be bronzed by the open air
 And well walk with the stride of a newborn pride
 with a newfound joy in our eyes
 Scornful men who have diced with death under the naked skies

 And when we get back to the dreary grind and the baldheaded bosss call
 Dont you think that the dingy windowblind and the dingier office wall
 Will suddenly melt to a vision of space of violent flamescarred night
 Then    oh the joy of the dangerthrill and oh the roar of the fight

 Dont you think as we peddle a card of pins the counter will fade away
 And again well be seeing the sandbag rims and the barbwires misty grey
 As a flat voice asks for a pound of tea dont you fancy well hear instead
 The nightwind moan and the soothing drone of the packet thats overhead

 Dont you guess that the things were seeing now
 will haunt us through all the years
 Heaven and hell rolled into one glory and blood and tears
 Lifes pattern picked with a scarlet thread where once we wove with a grey
 To remind us all how we played our part in the shock of an epic day

 Oh were booked for the Great Adventure now
 were pledged to the Real Romance
 Well find ourselves or well lose ourselves somewhere in giddy old France
 Well know the zest of the fighters life the best that we have well give
 Well hunger and thirst well die    but first
 well live by the gods well live

 Well breathe free air and well bivouac under the starry sky
 Well march with men and well fight with men
 and well see men laugh and die
 Well know such joy as we never dreamed well fathom the deeps of pain
 But the hardest bit of it all will bewhen we come back home again

 _For some of us smirk in a chiffon shop
 and some of us teach in a school
 Some of us help with the seat of our pants to polish an office stool
 The merits of somebodys soap or jam some of us seek to explain
 But all of us wonder what well do when we have to go back again_




Grandpere



 And so when he reached my bed
 The General made a stand
 My brave young fellow he said
 I would shake your hand

 So I lifted my arm the right
 With never a hand at all
 Only a stump a sight
 Fit to appal

 Well well Now thats too bad
 Thats sorrowful luck he said
 But there You give me my lad
 The left instead

 So from under the blankets rim
 I raised and showed him the other
 A snag as ugly and grim
 As its ugly brother

 He looked at each jagged wrist
 He looked but he did not speak
 And then he bent down and kissed
 Me on either cheek

 You wonder now I dont mind
 I hadnt a hand to offer   
 They tell me you know Im blind
 _TWAS GRANDPEERE JOFFRE_




Son



 He hurried away young heart of joy under our Devon sky
 And I watched him go my beautiful boy and a weary woman was I
 For my hair is grey and his was gold hed the best of his life to live
 And Id loved him so and Im old Im old and hes all I had to give

 Ah yes he was proud and swift and gay but oh how my eyes were dim
 With the sun in his heart he went away but he took the sun with him
 For look How the leaves are falling now
 and the winter wont be long   
 Oh boy my boy with the sunny brow and the lips of love and of song

 How we used to sit at the days sweet end we two by the firelights gleam
 And wed drift to the Valley of Lets Pretend
 on the beautiful river of Dream
 Oh dear little heart All wealth untold would I gladly gladly pay
 Could I just for a moment closely hold that golden head to my grey

 For I gaze in the fire and Im seeing there a child and he waves to me
 And I run and I hold him up in the air and he laughs and shouts with glee
 A little bundle of love and mirth crying Come Mumsie dear
 Ah me If he called from the ends of the earth
 I know that my heart would hear

     

 Yet the thought comes thrilling through all my pain
 how worthier could he die
 Yea a loss like that is a glorious gain and pitiful proud am I
 For Peace must be bought with blood and tears
 and the boys of our hearts must pay
 And so in our joy of the afteryears let us bless them every day

 And though I know theres a hasty grave with a poor little cross at its head
 And the gold of his youth he so gladly gave yet to me hell never be dead
 And the sun in my Devon lane will be gay and my boy will be with me still
 So Im finding the heart to smile and say Oh God if it be Thy Will




The Black Dudeen



 _Humping it here in the dugout
 Sucking me black dudeen
 Id like to say in a general way
 Theres nothing like Nickyteen
 Theres nothing like Nickyteen me boys
 Be it pipes or snipes or cigars
 So be sure that a bloke
 Has plenty to smoke
 If you wants him to fight your wars_

 When Ive eat my fill and my belt is snug
 I begin to think of my baccy plug
 I whittle a fill in my horny palm
 And the bowl of me old clay pipe I cram
 I trim the edges I tamp it down
 I nurse a light with an anxious frown
 I begin to draw and my cheeks tuck in
 And all my face is a blissful grin
 And up in a cloud the good smoke goes
 And the good pipe glimmers and fades and glows
 In its throat it chuckles a cheery song
 For I likes it hot and I likes it strong
 Oh its good is grub when youre feeling hollow
 But the best of a meals the smoke to follow

 There was Micky and me on a night patrol
 Having to hide in a fizzbang hole
 And sure I thought I was worse than dead
 Wi them crumpcrumps hustlin over me head
 Sure I thought twas the dirty spot
 Hammer and tongs till the air was hot
 And mind you water up to your knees
 And cold A monkey of brass would freeze
 And if we ventured our noses out
 A typewriter clattered its pills about
 The field of glory Well I dont think
 Id sooner be safe and snug in clink

 Then Micky he goes and he cops one bad
 He always was having illluck poor lad
 Says he Old chummy Im booked right through
 Death and me as a wrongday voo
 But    avent you got a pinch of shag
 Id sell me perishin soul for a fag
 And there he shivered and cussed his luck
 So I gave him me old black pipe to suck
 And he heaves a sigh and he takes to it
 Like a babby takes to his mammys tit
 Like an infant takes to his mothers breast
 Poor little Micky he went to rest

 But the dawn was near though the night was black
 So I left him there and I started back
 And I laughed as the silly old bullets came
 For the bullet aint made wots got me name
 Yet some of em buzzed onhealthily near
 And one little blighter just chipped me ear
 But there I got to the trench all right
 When sudden I jumped wi a start o fright
 And a word that doesnt look well in type
 _ID CLEAN FORGOTTEN ME OLD CLAY PIPE_

 So I had to do it all over again
 Crawling out on that filthy plain
 Through shells and bombs and bullets and all
 Only this timeI do not crawl
 I run like a man wots missing a train
 Or a tomcat caught in a plump of rain
 I hear the spit of a quickfire gun
 Tickle my heels but I run I run

 Through crash and crackle and flicker and flame
 Oh the packet aint issued wots got me name
 I run like a man thats no ideer
 Of hunting around for a sooveneer
 I run bang into a German chap
 And he stares like an owl so I bash his map
 And just to show him that Im his boss
 I gives him a kick on the parados
 And I marches him back with me all serene
 With _TUCKED IN ME GUB ME OLD DUDEEN_

 _Sitting here in the trenches
 Me hearts asplittin with spleen
 For a parcel o lead comes missing me head
 But it smashes me old dudeen
 God blast that redheaded sniper
 Ill give him somethin to snipe
 Before the wars through
 Just see how I do
 That blighter that smashed me pipe_




The Little Pioupiou

  The French Tommy



 Oh some of us lolled in the chateau
 And some of us slinked in the slum
 But now we are here with a song and a cheer
 To serve at the sign of the drum
 They put us in trousers of scarlet
 In big sloppy ulsters of blue
 In boots that are flat a box of a hat
 And they call us the little pioupiou
 Pioupiou
 The laughing and quaffing pioupiou
 The swinging and singing pioupiou
 And so with a rattle we march to the battle
 The weary but cheery pioupiou

 _Encore un petit verre de vin
 Pour nous mettre en route
 Encore un petit verre de vin
 Pour nous mettre en train_

 They drive us headon for the slaughter
 We havent got much of a chance
 The issue looks bad but were awfully glad
 To battle and die for La France
 For some must be killed that is certain
 Theres only ones duty to do
 So we leap to the fray in the glorious way
 They expect of the little pioupiou
 En avant
 The way of the gallant pioupiou
 The dashing and smashing pioupiou
 The way grim and gory that leads us to glory
 Is the way of the little pioupiou

 _Allons enfants de la Patrie
 Le jour de gloire est arrive_

 Today you would scarce recognise us
 Such veterans warwise are we
 So grimy and hard so calloused and scarred
 So crummy yet gay as can be
 Weve finished with trousers of scarlet
 Theyre giving us breeches of blue
 With a helmet instead of a cap on our head
 Yet still were the little pioupiou
 Nous les aurons
 The jesting unresting pioupiou
 The cheering unfearing pioupiou
 The keepyourheadlevel and fightlikethedevil
 The dying defying pioupiou

 _A la bayonette Jusqua la mort
 Sonnez la charge clairons_




Bill the Bomber



 The poppies gleamed like bloody pools through cottonwoolly mist
 The Captain kept alookin at the watch upon his wrist
 And there we smoked and squatted as we watched the shrapnel flame
 Twas wonnerful Im tellin you how fast them bullets came
 Twas weary work the waiting though I tried to sleep a wink
 For waitin means athinkin and it doesnt do to think
 So I closed my eyes a little and I had a niceish dream
 Of astandin by a dresser with a dish of Devon cream
 But I hadnt time to sample it for suddenlike I woke
 Come on me lads the Captain says n I climbed out through the smoke

 We spread out in the open it was like a bath of lead
 But the boys they cheered and hollered fit to raise the bloody dead
 Till a beastly bullet copped em then they lay without a sound
 And its oddwe didnt seem to heed them corpses on the ground
 And I kept on thinkin thinkin as the bullets faster flew
 How they picks the werry best men and they lets the rotters through
 So indiscriminatin like they spares a man of sin
 And a rare lad wots a husband and a father gets done in
 And while havin these reflections and advancin on the run
 A bullet biffs me shoulder and says I Thats number one

 Well it downed me for a jiffy but I didnt lose me calm
 For I knew that I was needed Im a bomber so I am
 I ad lost me cap and rifle but I carried on because
 I ad me bombs and knew that they was needed so they was
 We didnt ave no singin now nor many men to cheer
 Maybe the shrapnel drowned em crashin out so werry near
 And the Maxims got us sideways and the bullets faster flew
 And I copped one on me flipper and says I Thats number two

 I was pleased it was the left one for I ad me bombs ye see
 And twas ard if theyd be wasted like and all along o me
 And Id lost me at and riflebut I told you that before
 So I packed me mit inside me coat and carried on once more
 But the rumpus it was wicked and the men were scarcer yet
 And I felt me ginger goin but me jaws I kindo set
 And we passed the Boche first trenches which was eapin igh with dead
 And we started for their second which was fifty feet ahead
 When something like a ammer smashed me savage on the knee
 And down I came all muck and blood Says I Thats number three

 So there I lay all elpless like and bloody sick at that
 And worryin like anythink because Id lost me at
 And thinkin of me missis and the partin words she said
 If you gets killed write quick ol man and tell me as youre dead
 And lookin at me bunch o bombsthat was the ardest blow
 To think Id never ave the chance to url them at the foe
 And there was all our boys in front afightin there like mad
 And me as could ave elped em wiv the lovely bombs I ad
 And so I cussed and cussed and then I struggled back again
 Into that bit of battered trench packed solid with its slain

 Now as I lay alyin there and blastin of me lot
 And wishin I could just dispose of all them bombs Id got
 I sees within the doorway of a shy retirin dugout
 Six Boches all agrinnin and their Captain stuck is mug out
 And they ad a nice machine gun and I twigged what they was at
 And they fixed it on a tripod and I watched em like a cat
 And they got it in position and they seemed so werry glad
 Like theyd got us in a deathtrap which condemn their souls they ad
 For there our boys was fightin fifty yards in front and ere
 This lousy bunch of Boches they ad got us in the rear

 Oh it set me blood aboilin and I quite forgot me pain
 So I started crawlin crawlin over all them mounds of slain
 And them barstards was so busylike they ad no eyes for me
 And me bleedin leg was draggin but me right arm it was free   
 And now they ave it all in shape and swingin sweet and clear
 And now theyre all excited like butI am drawin near
 And now they ave it loaded up and now theyre takin aim   
 Rattattattat Oh here says I is where I join the game
 And my right arm it goes swingin and a bomb it goes aslingin
 And that typewriter goes wingin in a thunderbolt of flame

 Then these Boches wot was left of em they tumbled down their ole
 And up I climbed a mound of dead and down on them I stole
 And oh that blessed moment when I heard their frightened yell
 And I laughed down in that dugout ere I bombed their souls to hell
 And now Im in the hospital surprised that Im alive
 We started out a thousand men we came back thirtyfive
 And Im minus of a trotter but Im most amazin gay
 For me bombs they wasnt wasted though you might say thrown away




The Whistle of Sandy McGraw



 You may talk o your lutes and your dulcimers fine
 Your harps and your tabors and cymbals and a
 But here in the trenches jist gie me for mine
 The wee penny whistle o Sandy McGraw
 Oh its Sandy ma lad will you lilt us a tune
 And Sandy is willin and trillin like mad
 Sae silvery sweet that we a throng aroun
 And some o its gay but the maist o its sad
 Jist the wee simple airs that sink intae your hert
 And grup ye wi love and wi longin for hame
 And ye glour like an owl till youre feelin the stert
 O a tear and you blink wi a feelin o shame
 For his songs o the heather and here in the dirt
 You listen and dream o a land thats sae braw
 And he maks you forget a the harm and the hurt
 For he pipes like a laverock does Sandy McGraw

     

 At Eepers I mind me when rank upon rank
 We rose from the trenches and swept like the gale
 Till the rapidfire guns got us fell on the flank
 And the murderin bullets came swishin like hail
 Till a that were left o us faltered and broke
 Till it seemed for a moment a panicky rout
 When shrill through the fume and the flash and the smoke
 The wee valiant voice o a whistle piped out
 The Campbells are Comin Then into the fray
 We bounded wi bayonets reekin and raw
 And oh we fair revelled in glory that day
 Jist thanks to the whistle o Sandy McGraw

     

 At Loose it wis after a sconnersome fecht
 On the field o the slain I wis crawlin aboot
 And the rockets were burnin red holes in the nicht
 And the guns they were veciously thunderin oot
 When sudden I heard a bit sound like a sigh
 And there in a crumphole a kiltie I saw
 Whit ails ye ma lad Are ye woundit says I
 Ive lost ma wee whustle says Sandy McGraw
 Twas oot by yon bing where we pressed the attack
 It drapped frae ma pooch and between noo and dawn
 There isna much time so Im jist crawlin back   
 Yere daft man I telt him but Sandy wis gone

 Weel I waited a wee then I crawled oot masel
 And the big stuff wis gorin and roarin around
 And I seemed tae be under the oxter o hell
 And Creation wis crackin tae bits by the sound
 And I says in ma mind Gang ye back ye auld fule
 When I thrilled tae a note that wis saucy and sma
 And there in a crater collected and cool
 Wi his wee penny whistle wis Sandy McGraw
 Ay there he wis playin as gleg as could be
 And listenin hard wis a spectacled Boche
 Then Sandy turned roon and he noddit tae me
 And he says Dinna blab on me Sergeant McTosh
 The auld chap is deein He likes me tae play
 Its makin him happy Jist see his een shine
 And thrillin and sweet in the hert o the fray
 Wee Sandy wis playin The Watch on the Rhine

     

 The last scene o atwas the day that we took
 That bit o black ruin they ca Labbiesell
 It seemed the hale hillside jist shivered and shook
 And the red skies were roarin and spewin oot shell
 And the Sergeants were cursin tae keep us in hand
 And hard on the leash we were strainin like dugs
 When upward we shot at the word o command
 And the bullets were dingin their songs in oor lugs
 And onward we swept wi a yell and a cheer
 And a wis destruction confusion and din
 And we knew that the trench o the Boches wis near
 And it seemed jist the safest bit hole tae be in
 So we a tumbled doon and the Boches were there
 And they held up their hands and they yelled Kamarad
 And I merched aff wi ten wi their palms in the air
 And my I wis proodlike and my I wis glad
 And I thocht if ma lassie could see me jist then   
 When sudden I sobered at somethin I saw
 And I stopped and I stared and I halted ma men
 For there on a stretcher wis Sandy McGraw

 Weel he looks in ma face jist as game as ye please
 Ye ken hoo I hate tae be workin says he
 But noo I can play in the street for bawbees
 Wi baith o ma legs taken aff at the knee
 And though I could see he wis rackit wi pain
 He reached for his whistle and stertit tae play
 And quaverin sweet wis the pensive refrain
 The floors o the forest are a wede away
 Then sudden he stoppit Man wis it no grand
 Hoo we took a them trenches    He shakit his heid
 Illnoplaynaemair feebly doon frae his hand
 Slipped the wee penny whistle and_SANDY WIS DEID_

     

 And so you may talk o your Steinways and Strads
 Your wonderful organs and brasses sae braw
 But oot in the trenches jist gie me ma lads
 Yon wee penny whistle o Sandy McGraw




The StretcherBearer



 My stretcher is one scarlet stain
 And as I tries to scrape it clean
 I tell you wotIm sick with pain
 For all Ive eard for all Ive seen
 Around me is the ellish night
 And as the wars red rim I trace
 I wonder if in Eavens height
 Our God dont turn away Is Face

 I dont care oose the Crime may be
 I olds no brief for kin or clan
 I ymns no ate I only see
 As man destroys his brother man
 I waves no flag I only know
 As ere beside the dead I wait
 A million earts is weighed with woe
 A million omes is desolate

 In drippin darkness far and near
 All night Ive sought them woeful ones
 Dawn shudders up and still I ear
 The crimson chorus of the guns
 Look like a ball of blood the sun
 Angs oer the scene of wrath and wrong   
 Quick Stretcherbearers on the run
 _O PRINCE OF PEACE OW LONG OW LONG_




Wounded



 Is it not strange A year ago today
 With scarce a thought beyond the humdrum round
 I did my decent job and earned my pay
 Was averagely happy Ill be bound
 Ay in my little groove I was content
 Seeing my life run smoothly to the end
 With prosy days in stolid labour spent
 And jolly nights a pipe a glass a friend
 In Gods good time a hearth fires cosy gleam
 A wife and kids and all a fellow needs
 When presto like a bubble goes my dream
 I leap upon the Stage of Splendid Deeds
 I yell with rage I wallow deep in gore
 I that was clerk in a drysalters store

 Stranger than any book Ive ever read
 Here on the reeking battlefield I lie
 Under the stars propped up with smeary dead
 Like too if no one takes me in to die
 Hit on the arms legs liver lungs and gall
 Damn glad theres nothing more of me to hit
 But calm and feeling never pain at all
 And full of wonder at the turn of it
 For of the dead around me three are mine
 Three foemen vanquished in the whirl of fight
 So if I die I have no right to whine
 I feel Ive done my little bit all right
 I dont know howbut there the beggars are
 As dead as herrings pickled in a jar

 And here am I worse wounded than I thought
 For in the fight a bullet beelike stings
 You never heed the air is metalhot
 And all alive with little flicking wings
 _BUT ON YOU CHARGE_ You see the fellows fall
 Your pal was by your side fair fightingmad
 You turn to him and lo no pal at all
 You wonder vaguely if hes copped it bad
 _BUT ON YOU CHARGE_ The heavens vomit death
 And vicious death is besoming the ground
 Youre blind with sweat youre dazed and out of breath
 And though you yell you cannot hear a sound
 _BUT ON YOU CHARGE_ Oh Wars a rousing game
 Around you smoky clouds like ogres tower
 The earth is rowelled deep with spurs of flame
 And on your helmet stones and ashes shower
 _BUT ON YOU CHARGE_ Its odd You have no fear
 Machinegun bullets whip and lash your path
 Red yellow black the smoky giants rear
 The shrapnel rips the heavens roar in wrath
 _BUT ON YOU CHARGE_ Barbed wire all trampled down
 The ground all gored and rent as by a blast
 Grim heaps of grey where once were heaps of brown
 A ragged ditchthe Hun first line at last
 All smashed to hell Their second right ahead
 _SO ON YOU CHARGE_ Theres nothing else to do
 More reeking holes blood barbed wire gruesome dead
 Your puttee straps undonethat worries you
 You glare around You think youre all alone
 But no your chums come surging left and right
 The nearest chap flops down without a groan
 His face still snarling with the rage of fight
 Ha heres the second trenchjust like the first
 Only a little more so more laid out
 More pounded flamecorroded deathaccurst
 A pretty piece of work beyond a doubt
 Now for the third and there your job is done
 _SO ON YOU CHARGE_ You never stop to think
 Your cursed puttees trailing as you run
 You feel youd sell your soul to have a drink
 The acrid air is full of cracking whips
 You wonder how it is youre going still
 You foam with rage Oh God to be at grips
 With someone you can rush and crush and kill
 Your sleeve is dripping blood youre seeing red
 Youre battlemad your turn is coming now
 See theres the jagged barbed wire straight ahead
 And theres the trenchyoull get there anyhow
 Your puttee catches on a strand of wire
 And down you go perhaps it saves your life
 For over sandbag rims you see em fire
 Cropheaded chaps their eyes ablaze with strife
 You crawl you cower then once again you plunge
 With all your comrades roaring at your heels
 _HAVE AT EM LADS_ You stab you jab you lunge
 A blaze of glory then the red world reels
 A crash of triumph then    youre faint a bit   
 That cursed puttee Now to fasten it   

 Well thats the charge And now Im here alone
 Ive built a little wall of Hun on Hun
 To shield me from the leaden bees that drone
 It saves me worry and it hurts em none
 The only thing Im wondering is when
 Some stretchermen will stroll along my way
 It isnt much thats left of me but then
 Where life is hope is so at least they say
 Well if Im spared Ill be the happy lad
 I tell you I wont envy any king
 Ive stood the racket and Im proud and glad
 Ive had my crowning hour Oh Wars the thing
 It gives us common working chaps our chance
 A taste of glory chivalry romance

 Ay War they say is hell its heaven too
 It lets a man discover what hes worth
 It takes his measure shows what he can do
 Gives him a joy like nothing else on earth
 It fans in him a flame that otherwise
 Would flicker out these drab discordant days
 It teaches him in pain and sacrifice
 Faith fortitude grim courage past all praise
 Yes War is good So here beside my slain
 A happy wreck I wait amid the din
 For even if I perish mines the gain   
 Hi there you fellows WONT you take me in
 Give me a fag to smoke upon the way   
 Weve taken La Boiselle The hell you say
 Well that would make a corpse sit up and grin   
 Lead on Ill live to fight another day




Faith



 Since all that is was ever bound to be
 Since grim eternal laws our Being bind
 And both the riddle and the answer find
 And both the carnage and the calm decree
 Since plain within the Book of Destiny
 Is written all the journey of mankind
 Inexorably to the end since blind
 And mortal puppets playing parts are we

 Then lets have faith good cometh out of ill
 The power that shaped the strife shall end the strife
 Then lets bow down before the Unknown Will
 Fight on believing all is well with life
 Seeing within the worst of Wars red rage
 The gleam the glory of the Golden Age




The Coward



 Ave you seen Bills mug in the Noos today
 Es gyned the Victoriar Cross they say
 Little Bill wot would grizzle and run away
 If you it im a swipe on the jawr
 Es slaughtered the Kaisers men in tons
 Es captured one of their quickfire guns
 And e adnt no practice in killin Uns
 Afore e went off to the war

 Little Bill wot I nussed in is byby clothes
 Little Bill wot told me is childish woes
 Ow often Ive tidied is pore little nose
 Wiv the em of me pinnyfore
 And now all the papers is praises ring
 And es been and es shaken the and of the King
 And I sawr im today in the ward pore thing
 Where theyre patchin im up once more

 And e says Wot dye think of it Lizer Ann
 And I says Well I cant make it out old man
 Youd ook it as soon as a scrap began
 When you was a bit of a kid
 And e whispers Ere on the quiet Liz
 Theyre makin too much of the ole damn biz
 And the papers is printin me ugly phiz
 But    Im anged if I know wot I did

 Oh the Captain comes and e says Look ere
 Theyre far too quiet out there its queer
 Theyre up to somethinooll volunteer
 To crawl in the dark and see
 Then I felt me eart like a ammer go
 And up jumps a chap and e says Right O
 But I chips in straight and I says Oh no
 Es a missis and kidstake me

 And the next I knew I was sneakin out
 And the oozy corpses was all about
 And I felt so scared I wanted to shout
 And me skin fair prickled wiv fear
 And I sez You coward You ad no right
 To take on the job of a man this night
 Yet still I kept creepin till orrid sight
 The trench of the Uns was near

 It was all so dark it was all so still
 Yet somethin pushed me against me will
 Ow I wanted to turn Yet I crawled until
 I was seein a dim light shine
 Then thinks I Ill just go a little bit
 And see wot the doose I can make of it
 And it seemed to come from the mouth of a pit
 Christmas sez I a _MINE_

 Then eres the part wot I cant explain
 I wanted to make for ome again
 But somethin was blazin inside me brain
 So I crawled to the trench instead
 Then I saw the bullet ead of a Un
 And e stood by a rapidfirer gun
 And I lifted a rock and I it im one
 And e dropped like a chunk o lead

 Then all the Uns that was underground
 Comes up with a rush and on with a bound
 And I swings that giddy old Maxim round
 And belts em solid and square
 You see I was off me chump wiv fear
 If Im sellin me life sez I its dear
 And the trench was narrow and they was near
 So I peppered the brutes for fair

 So I eld em back and I yelled wiv fright
 And the boys attacked and we ad a fight
 And we captured a section o trench that night
 Which we didnt expect to get
 And they found me there with me Maxim gun
 And Id laid out a score if Id laid out one
 And I fainted away when the thing was done
 And I avent got over it yet

 So thats the istory Bill told me
 Of course its all on the strict Q T
 It wouldnt do to get out you see
 As e hacted against is will
 But es convalescin wiv all is might
 And e opes to be fit for another fight
 Say Aint e a bit of the real all right
 Wots the matter with Bill




Missis Moriartys Boy



 Missis Moriarty called last week and says she to me says she
 Sure the heart of mes broken entirely now
 its the fortunate woman you are
 Youve still got your Dinnis to cheer up your home
 but me Patsy boy where is he
 Lyin alone cold as a stone kilt in the weariful wahr
 Oh Im seein him now as I looked on him last
 wid his hair all curly and bright
 And the wonderful tenderful heart he had and his eyes as he wint away
 Shinin and lookin down on me from the pride of his proper height
 Sure Ill remember me boy like that if I live to me dyin day

 And just as she spoke them very same words me Dinnis came in at the door
 Came in from McGonigles ould shebeen came in from drinkin his pay
 And Missis Moriarty looked at him and she didnt say anny more
 But she wrapped her head in her ould black shawl and she quietly wint away
 And what was I thinkin I ask ye now as I put me Dinnis to bed
 Wid him ravin and cursin one half of the night as cold by his side I sat
 Was I thinkin the poor ould woman she was
 wid her Patsy slaughtered and dead
 Was I weepin for Missis Moriarty Im not so sure about that

 Missis Moriarty goes about wid a shinin look on her face
 Wid her grey hair under her ould black shawl
 and the eyes of her mothermild
 Some say shes a little bit off her head but annyway its the case
 Her timpers so swate that you nivver would tell
 shed be losin her only child
 And I think as I wait up ivery night for me Dinnis to come home blind
 And Im hearin his stumblin foot on the stair along about halfpast three
 Sure theres many a way of breakin a heart and I havent made up me mind
 Would I be Missis Moriarty or Missis Moriarty me




My Foe

 A Belgian PriestSoldier Speaks


 _GURR_ You cochon Stand and fight
 Show your mettle Snarl and bite
 Spawn of an accursed race
 Turn and meet me face to face
 Here amid the wreck and rout
 Let us grip and have it out
 Here where ruins rock and reel
 Let us settle steel to steel
 Look Our houses how they spit
 Sparks from brands your friends have lit
 See Our gutters running red
 Bright with blood your friends have shed
 Hark Amid your drunken brawl
 How our maidens shriek and call
 Why have _YOU_ come here alone
 To this hearths bloodspattered stone
 Come to ravish come to loot
 Come to play the ghoulish brute
 Ah indeed We well are met
 Bayonet to bayonet
 God I never killed a man
 Now Ill do the best I can
 Rip you to the evil heart
 Laugh to see the lifeblood start
 Bah You swine I hate you so
 Show you mercy No    and no   

 There Ive done it See He lies
 Death astaring from his eyes
 Glazing eyeballs panting breath
 How its horrible is Death
 Plucking at his bloody lips
 With his trembling fingertips
 Choking in a dreadful way
 As if he would something say
 In that uncouth tongue of his   
 Oh how horrible Death is

 How I wish that he would die
 So unnerved unmanned am I
 See His twitching face is white
 See His bubbling blood is bright
 Why do I not shout with glee
 What strange spell is over me
 There he lies the fight was fair
 Let me toss my cap in air
 Why am I so silent Why
 Do I pray for him to die
 Where is all my vengeful joy
 Ugh _MY FOE IS BUT A BOY_

 Id a brother of his age
 Perished in the wars red rage
 Perished in the Ypres hell
 Oh I loved my brother well
 And though I be hard and grim
 How it makes me think of him
 He had just such flaxen hair
 As the lad thats lying there
 Just such frank blue eyes were his   
 God How horrible war is

 I have reason to be gay
 There is one less foe to slay
 I have reason to be glad
 Yetmy foe is such a lad
 So I watch in dull amaze
 See his dying eyes aglaze
 See his face grow glorified
 See his hands outstretched and wide
 To that bit of ruined wall
 Where the flames have ceased to crawl
 Where amid the crumbling bricks
 Hangs _A BLACKENED CRUCIFIX_

 Now oh now I understand
 Quick I press it in his hand
 Close his feeble fingertips
 Hold it to his faltering lips
 As I watch his welling blood
 I would stem it if I could
 God of Pity let him live
 God of Love forgive forgive

     

 His face looked strangely as he died
 Like that of One they crucified
 And in the pocket of his coat
 I found a letter thus he wrote
 The things Ive seen Oh mother dear
 Im wondering can God be here
 Tonight amid the drunken brawl
 I saw a Cross hung on a wall
 Ill seek it now and there alone
 Perhaps I may atone atone   

 Ah no Tis I who must atone
 No other saw but God alone
 Yet how can I forget the sight
 Of that face so woeful white
 Dead I kissed him as he lay
 Knelt by him and tried to pray
 Left him lying there at rest
 Crucifix upon his breast

 Not for him the pity be
 Ye who pity pity me
 Crawling now the ways I trod
 Bloodguilty in sight of God

The Song of the Pacifist



 What do they matter our headlong hates when we take the toll of our Dead
 Think ye our glory and gain will pay for the torrent of blood we have shed
 By the cheers of our Victory will the heart of the mother be comforted

 If by the Victory all we mean is a broken and brooding foe
 Is the pomp and power of a glittring hour and a truce for an age or so
 By the claycold hand on the broken blade we have smitten a bootless blow

 If by the Triumph we only prove that the sword we sheathe is bright
 That justice and truth and love endure that freedoms throned on the height
 That the feebler folks shall be unafraid that Might shall never be Right

 If this be all by the blooddrenched plains by the havoc of fire and fear
 By the rending roar of the War of Wars by the Dead so doubly dear   
 Then our Victory is a vast defeat and it mocks us as we cheer

 Victory there can be but one hallowed in every land
 When by the graves of our common dead we who were foemen stand
 And in the hush of our common grief hand is tendered to hand

 Triumph Yes when out of the dust in the splendour of their release
 The spirits of those who fell go forth and they hallow our hearts to peace
 And brothers in pain with worldwide voice
 we clamour that War shall cease

 Glory Ay when from blackest loss shall be born most radiant gain
 When over the gory fields shall rise a star that never shall wane
 Then and then only our Dead shall know that they have not falln in vain

 When our childrens children shall talk of War as a madness that may not be
 When we thank our God for our grief today and blazon from sea to sea
 In the name of the Dead the banner of Peace    _THAT WILL BE VICTORY_




The Twins



 There were two brothers John and James
 And when the town went up in flames
 To save the house of James dashed John
 Then turned and lo his own was gone

 And when the great World War began
 To volunteer John promptly ran
 And while he learned live bombs to lob
 James stayed at home andsneaked his job

 John came home with a missing limb
 That didnt seem to worry him
 But oh it set his brain awhirl
 To find that James hadsneaked his girl

 Time passed John tried his grief to drown
 Today James owns onehalf the town
 His army contracts riches yield
 And John Well _SEARCH THE POTTERS FIELD_




The Song of the Soldierborn



 _Give me the scorn of the stars and a peak defiant
 Wail of the pines and a wind with the shout of a giant
 Night and a trail unknown and a heart reliant_

 Give me to live and love in the old bold fashion
 A soldiers billet at night and a soldiers ration
 A heart that leaps to the fight with a soldiers passion

 For I hold as a simple faith theres no denying
 The trade of a soldiers the only trade worth plying
 The death of a soldiers the only death worth dying

 So let me go and leave your safety behind me
 Go to the spaces of hazard where nothing shall bind me
 Go till the word is Warand then you will find me

 Then you will call me and claim me because you will need me
 Cheer me and gird me and into the battlewrath speed me   
 And when its over spurn me and no longer heed me

 For guile and a purse goldgreased are the arms you carry
 With deeds of paper you fight and with pens you parry
 You call on the hounds of the law your foes to harry

 You with your Art for its own sake posing and prinking
 You with your Live and be merry eating and drinking
 You with your Peace at all hazard from bright blood shrinking

 Fools I will tell you now though the red rain patters
 And a million of men go down its little it matters   
 Theres the Flag upflung to the stars though it streams in tatters

 Theres a glory gold never can buy to yearn and to cry for
 Theres a hope thats as old as the sky to suffer and sigh for
 Theres a faith that outdazzles the sun to martyr and die for

 Ah no its my dream that War will never be ended
 That men will perish like men and valour be splendid
 That the Flag by the sword will be served and honour defended

 That the tale of my fights will never be ancient story
 That though my eye may be dim and my beard be hoary
 Ill die as a soldier dies on the Field of Glory

 _So give me a strong right arm for a wrongs swift righting
 Stave of a song on my lips as my sword is smiting
 Death in my boots maybe but fighting fighting_




Afternoon Tea



 As I was saying    No thank you I never take cream with my tea
 Cows werent allowed in the trenchesgot out of the habit ysee
 As I was saying our Colonel leaped up like a youngster of ten
 Come on lads he shouts and well show em
 And he sprang to the head of the men
 Then some bally thing seemed to trip him
 and he fell on his face with a slam   
 Oh he died like a true British soldier
 and the last word he uttered was Damn
 And hang it I loved the old fellow and something just burst in my brain
 And I cared no more for the bullets than I would for a shower of rain
 Twas an awfly funny sensation I say this is jolly nice tea
 I felt as if something had broken by gad I was suddenly free
 Free for a glorified moment beyond regulations and laws
 Free just to wallow in slaughter as the chap of the Stone Age was
 So on I went joyously nursing a Berserker rage of my own
 And though all my chaps were behind me feeling most frightfly alone
 With the bullets and shells dingdonging
 and the krock and the swish of the shrap
 And I found myself humming Ben Bolt   
 Will you pass me the sugar old chap
 Two lumps please    What was I saying Oh yes the jolly old dash
 We simply ripped through the barrage and on with a roar and a crash
 My fellowsOld Nick couldnt stop em On on they went with a yell
 Till they tripped on the Boches sandbagsnothing much left to tell
 A trench so tattered and battered that even a rat couldnt live
 Some corpses tangled and mangled wire you could pass through a sieve
 The jolly old guns had bilked us cheated us out of our show
 And my fellows were simply yearning for a red mixup with the foe
 So I shouted to them to follow and on we went roaring again
 Battletuned and exultant on in the leaden rain
 Then all at once a machine gun barks from a bit of a bank
 And our Major roars in a fury Weve got to take it on flank
 He was running like fire to lead us when down like a stone he comes
 As full of typewriter bullets as a pudding is full of plums
 So I took his job and we got em    By gad we got em like rats
 Down in a deep shellcrater we fought like Kilkenny cats
 Twas pleasant just for a moment to be sheltered and out of range
 With someone you _SAW_ to go forit made an agreeable change
 And the Boches that missed my bullets my chaps gave a bayonet jolt
 And all the time I remember I whistled and hummed Ben Bolt

 Well that little job was over so hell for leather we ran
 On to the second line trenchesthats where the fun began
 For though we had strafed em like fury there still were some Boches about
 And my fellows teeth set and eyes glaring like terriers routed em out
 Then I stumbled on one of their dugouts and I shouted Is anyone there
 And a voice Yes one but Im wounded came faint up the narrow stair
 And my man was descending before me when sudden a cry a shot
 I say this cake is delicious You make it yourself do you not
 My man Oh they killed the poor devil for if there was one there was ten
 So after Id bombed em sufficient I went down at the head of my men
 And four tried to sneak from a bunkhole
 but we cornered the rotters all right
 Id rather not go into details twas messy that bit of the fight
 But all of its beastly messy lets talk of pleasanter things
 The skirts that the girls are wearing ridiculous fluffy things
 So short that they show    Oh hang it Well if I must I must
 We cleaned out the second trench line bomb and bayonet thrust
 And on we went to the third one quite calloused to crumping by now
 And some of our fellows whod passed us were making a deuce of a row
 And my chapswell I just couldnt hold em
 Its strange how it is with gore
 In some ways its just like whiskey if you taste it you must have more
 Their eyes were like beacons of battle by gad sir they _COULDNT_ be calmed
 So I headed em bang for the bombbelt racing like billybedamned
 Oh it didnt take long to arrive there those who arrived at all
 The machine guns were certainly chronic the shindy enough to appal
 Oh yes I omitted to tell you Id wounds on the chest and the head
 And my shirt was torn to a gunrag and my face bloodgummy and red
 Im thinking I looked like a madman I fancy I felt one too
 Half naked and swinging a rifle    God what a glorious do
 As I sit here in old Piccadilly sipping my afternoon tea
 I see a blind bulletchipped devil and its hard to believe that its me
 I see a wild wardamaged demon smashing out left and right
 And humming Ben Bolt rather loudly and hugely enjoying the fight
 And as for my men may God bless em Ive loved em ever since then
 They fought like the shining angels theyre the pick o the land my men
 And the trench was a reeking shambles not a Boche to be seen alive
 So I thought but on rounding a traverse I came on a covey of five
 And four of em threw up their flippers
 but the fifth chap a sergeant was game
 And though Id a bomb and revolver he came at me just the same
 A sporty thing that I tell you I just couldnt blow him to hell
 So I swung to the point of his jawbone and down like a ninepin he fell
 And then when Id brought him to reason he wasnt half bad that Hun
 He bandaged my head and my shortrib as well as the Doc could have done
 So back I went with my Boches as gay as a twoyearold colt
 And it suddenly struck me as rummy I still was ahumming Ben Bolt
 And now by Jove how Ive bored you Youve just let me babble away
 Lets talk of the things that _MATTER_your car or the newest play   




The Mourners



 I look into the aching womb of night
 I look across the mist that masks the dead
 The moon is tired and gives but little light
 The stars have gone to bed

 The earth is sick and seems to breathe with pain
 A lost wind whimpers in a mangled tree
 I do not see the foul corpsecluttered plain
 The dead I do not see

 The slain I _WOULD_ not see    and so I lift
 My eyes from out the shambles where they lie
 When lo a million womanfaces drift
 Like pale leaves through the sky

 The cheeks of some are channelled deep with tears
 But some are tearless with wild eyes that stare
 Into the shadow of the coming years
 Of fathomless despair

 And some are young and some are very old
 And some are rich some poor beyond belief
 Yet all are strangely like set in the mould
 Of everlasting grief

 They fill the vast of Heaven face on face
 And then I see one weeping with the rest
 Whose eyes beseech me for a moments space   
 Oh eyes I love the best

 Nay I but dream The sky is all forlorn
 And theres the plain of battle writhing red
 God pity them the womenfolk who mourn
 How happy are the dead




LEnvoi



 My job is done my rhymes are ranked and ready
 My wordbattalions marching verse by verse
 Here stanzacompanies are none too steady
 There printplatoons are weak but might be worse
 And as in marshalled order I review them
 My typebrigades unfearful of the fray
 My eyes that seek their faults are seeing through them
 Immortal visions of an epic day

 It seems Im in a giant bowlingalley
 The hidden heavies round me crash and thud
 A spire snaps like a pipestem in the valley
 The rising sun is like a ball of blood
 Along the road the fantassins are pouring
 And some are gay as fire and some steelstern   
 Then back again I see the red tide pouring
 Along the reeking road from Hebuterne

 And once again I seek Hill SixtySeven
 The Hun lines grey and peaceful in my sight
 When suddenly the rosy air is riven
 A coalbox blots the boyou on my right
 Or else to evil Carnoy I am stealing
 Past sentinels who hail with bated breath
 Where not a cigarette sparks dim revealing
 May hint our mission in that zone of death

 I see across the shrapnelseeded meadows
 The jagged rubbleheap of La Boiselle
 Bloodguilty Fricourt brooding in the shadows
 And Thiepvals chateau empty as a shell
 Down Alberts riven streets the moon is leering
 The Hanging Virgin takes its bitter ray
 And all the road from Hamel I am hearing
 The silver rage of bugles over Bray

 Once more within the skys deep sapphire hollow
 I sight a swimming Taube a fairy thing
 I watch the angry shell flame flash and follow
 In feather puffs that flick a tilted wing
 And then it fades with shrapnel mirrors flashing
 The flashes bloom to blossoms lily gold
 The batteries are rancorously crashing
 And life is just as full as it can hold

 Oh spacious days of glory and of grieving
 Oh sounding hours of lustre and of loss
 Let us be glad we lived you still believing
 The God who gave the cannon gave the Cross
 Let us be sure amid these seething passions
 The lusts of blood and hate our souls abhor
 The Power that Order out of Chaos fashions
 Smites fiercest in the wrathred forge of War   
 Have faith Fight on Amid the battlehell
 Love triumphs Freedom beacons all is well
