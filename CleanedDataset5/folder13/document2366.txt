THE BELDONALD HOLBEIN
by Henry James


CHAPTER I


Mrs Munden had not yet been to my studio on so good a pretext as when
she first intimated that it would be quite open to meshould I only
care as she called it to throw the handkerchiefto paint her beautiful
sisterinlaw I neednt go here more than is essential into the
question of Mrs Munden who would really by the way be a story in
herself She has a manner of her own of putting things and some of
those she has put to me Her implication was that Lady Beldonald
hadnt only seen and admired certain examples of my work but had
literally been prepossessed in favour of the painters personality Had
I been struck with this sketch I might easily have imagined her ladyship
was throwing me the handkerchief She hasnt done my visitor said
what she ought

Do you mean she has done what she oughtnt

Nothing horridah dear no And something in Mrs Mundens tone with
the way she appeared to muse a moment even suggested to me that what she
oughtnt was perhaps what Lady Beldonald had too much neglected She
hasnt got on

Whats the matter with her

Well to begin with shes American

But I thought that was the way of ways to get on

Its one of them But its one of the ways of being awfully out of it
too There are so many

So many Americans I asked

Yes plenty of _them_ Mrs Munden sighed So many ways I mean of
being one

But if your sisterinlaws way is to be beautiful

Oh there are different ways of that too

And she hasnt taken the right way

Well my friend returned as if it were rather difficult to express
she hasnt done with it

I see I laughed what she oughtnt

Mrs Munden in a manner corrected me but it _was_ difficult to express
My brother at all events was certainly selfish Till he died she was
almost never in London they wintered year after year for what he
supposed to be his healthwhich it didnt help since he was so much too
soon to meet his endin the south of France and in the dullest holes he
could pick out and when they came back to England he always kept her in
the country I must say for her that she always behaved beautifully
Since his death she has been more in London but on a stupidly
unsuccessful footing I dont think she quite understands She hasnt
what I should call a life It may be of course that she doesnt want
one Thats just what I cant exactly find out I cant make out how
much she knows

I can easily make out I returned with hilarity how much _you_ do

Well youre very horrid Perhaps shes too old

Too old for what I persisted

For anything Of course shes no longer even a little young only
preservedoh but preserved like bottled fruit in syrup I want to
help her if only because she gets on my nerves and I really think the
way of it would be just the right thing of yours at the Academy and on
the line

But suppose I threw out she should give on my nerves

Oh she will But isnt that all in the days work and dont great
beauties always

_You_ dont I interrupted but I at any rate saw Lady Beldonald later
onthe day came when her kinswoman brought her and then I saw how her
life must have its centre in her own idea of her appearance Nothing
else about her matteredone knew her all when one knew that Shes
indeed in one particular I think sole of her kinda person whom vanity
has had the odd effect of keeping positively safe and sound This
passion is supposed surely for the most part to be a principle of
perversion and of injury leading astray those who listen to it and
landing them sooner or later in this or that complication but it has
landed her ladyship nowhere whateverit has kept her from the first
moment of full consciousness one feels exactly in the same place It
has protected her from every danger has made her absolutely proper and
prim If shes preserved as Mrs Munden originally described her to
me its her vanity that has beautifully done itputting her years ago
in a plateglass case and closing up the receptacle against every breath
of air How shouldnt she be preserved when you might smash your
knuckles on this transparency before you could crack it And she isoh
amazingly Preservation is scarce the word for the rare condition of her
surface She looks _naturally_ new as if she took out every night her
large lovely varnished eyes and put them in water The thing was to
paint her I perceived in the glass casea most tempting attaching
feat render to the full the shining interposing plate and the general
showwindow effect

It was agreed though it wasnt quite arranged that she should sit to
me If it wasnt quite arranged this was because as I was made to
understand from an early stage the conditions from our start must be
such as should exclude all elements of disturbance such in a word as
she herself should judge absolutely favourable And it seemed that these
conditions were easily imperilled Suddenly for instance at a moment
when I was expecting her to meet an appointmentthe firstthat I had
proposed I received a hurried visit from Mrs Munden who came on her
behalf to let me know that the season happened just not to be propitious
and that our friend couldnt be quite sure to the hour when it would
again become so She felt nothing would make it so but a total absence of
worry

Oh a total absence I said is a large order We live in a worrying
world

Yes and she feels exactly thatmore than youd think Its in fact
just why she mustnt have as she has now a particular distress on at
the very moment She wants of course to look her best and such things
tell on her appearance

I shook my head Nothing tells on her appearance Nothing reaches it
in any way nothing gets _at_ it However I can understand her anxiety
But whats her particular distress

Why the illness of Miss Dadd

And who in the worlds Miss Dadd

Her most intimate friend and constant companionthe lady who was with
us here that first day

Oh the little round black woman who gurgled with admiration

None other But she was taken ill last week and it may very well be
that shell gurgle no more She was very bad yesterday and is no better
today and Ninas much upset If anything happens to Miss Dadd shell
have to get another and though she has had two or three before that
wont be so easy

Two or three Miss Dadds is it possible And still wanting another I
recalled the poor lady completely now No I shouldnt indeed think it
would be easy to get another But why is a succession of them necessary
to Lady Beldonalds existence

Cant you guess Mrs Munden looked deep yet impatient They help

Help what Help whom

Why every one You and me for instance To do what Why to think Nina
beautiful She has them for that purpose they serve as foils as
accents serve on syllables as terms of comparison They make her stand
out Its an effect of contrast that must be familiar to you artists
its what a woman does when she puts a band of black velvet under a pearl
ornament that may require as she thinks a little showing off

I wondered Do you mean she always has them black

Dear no Ive seen them blue green yellow They may be what they
like so long as theyre always one other thing

Hideous

Mrs Munden made a mouth for it Hideous is too much to say she
doesnt really require them as bad as that But consistently
cheerfully loyally plain Its really a most happy relation She loves
them for it

And for what do they love _her_

Why just for the amiability that they produce in her Then also for
their home Its a career for them

I see But if thats the case I asked why are they so difficult to
find

Oh they must be safe its all in that her being able to depend on them
to keep to the terms of the bargain and never have moments of risingas
even the ugliest woman will now and then say when shes in
lovesuperior to themselves

I turned it over Then if they cant inspire passions the poor things
maynt even at least feel them

She distinctly deprecates it Thats why such a man as you may be after
all a complication

I continued to brood Youre very sure Miss Dadds ailment isnt an
affection that being smothered has struck in My joke however
wasnt well timed for I afterwards learned that the unfortunate ladys
state had been even while I spoke such as to forbid all hope The
worst symptoms had appeared she was destined not to recover and a week
later I heard from Mrs Munden that she would in fact gurgle no more




CHAPTER II


All this had been for Lady Beldonald an agitation so great that access to
her apartment was denied for a time even to her sisterinlaw It was
much more out of the question of course that she should unveil her face
to a person of my special business with it so that the question of the
portrait was by common consent left to depend on that of the installation
of a successor to her late companion Such a successor I gathered from
Mrs Munden widowed childless and lonely as well as inapt for the minor
offices she had absolutely to have a more or less humble _alter ago_ to
deal with the servants keep the accounts make the tea and watch the
windowblinds Nothing seemed more natural than that she should marry
again and obviously that might come yet the predecessors of Miss Dadd
had been contemporaneous with a first husband so that others formed in
her image might be contemporaneous with a second I was much occupied in
those months at any rate and these questions and their ramifications
losing themselves for a while to my view I was only brought back to them
by Mrs Mundens arrival one day with the news that we were all right
againher sisterinlaw was once more suited A certain Mrs Brash
an American relative whom she hadnt seen for years but with whom she
had continued to communicate was to come out to her immediately and
this person it appeared could be quite trusted to meet the conditions
She was uglyugly enough without abuse of it and was unlimitedly good
The position offered her by Lady Beldonald was moreover exactly what she
needed widowed also after many troubles and reverses with her fortune
of the smallest and her various children either buried or placed about
she had never had time or means to visit England and would really be
grateful in her declining years for the new experience and the pleasant
light work involved in her cousins hospitality They had been much
together early in life and Lady Beldonald was immensely fond of herwould
in fact have tried to get hold of her before hadnt Mrs Brash been
always in bondage to family duties to the variety of her tribulations I
daresay I laughed at my friends use of the term positionthe
position one might call it of a candlestick or a signpost and I
daresay I must have asked if the special service the poor lady was to
render had been made clear to her Mrs Munden left me in any case with
the rather droll image of her faring forth across the sea quite
consciously and resignedly to perform it

The point of the communication had however been that my sitter was again
looking up and would doubtless on the arrival and due initiation of Mrs
Brash be in form really to wait on me The situation must further to
my knowledge have developed happily for I arranged with Mrs Munden
that our friend now all ready to begin but wanting first just to see
the things I had most recently done should come once more as a final
preliminary to my studio A good foreign friend of mine a French
painter Paul Outreau was at the moment in London and I had proposed
as he was much interested in types to get together for his amusement a
small afternoon party Every one came my big room was full there was
music and a modest spread and Ive not forgotten the light of admiration
in Outreaus expressive face as at the end of half an hour he came up to
me in his enthusiasm _Bonte divine mon cherque cette vieille est
donc belle_

I had tried to collect all the beauty I could and also all the youth so
that for a moment I was at a loss I had talked to many people and
provided for the music and there were figures in the crowd that were
still lost to me What old woman do you mean

I dont know her nameshe was over by the door a moment ago I asked
somebody and was told I think that shes American

I looked about and saw one of my guests attach a pair of fine eyes to
Outreau very much as if she knew he must be talking of her Oh Lady
Beldonald Yes shes handsome but the great point about her is that
she has been put up to keep and that she wouldnt be flattered if she
knew you spoke of her as old A box of sardines is old only after it
has been opened Lady Beldonald never has yet beenbut Im going to do
it I joked but I was somewhat disappointed It was a type that with
his unerring sense for the _banal_ I shouldnt have expected Outreau to
pick out

Youre going to paint her But my dear man she is paintedand as
neither you nor I can do it _Ou estelle donc_ He had lost her and I
saw I had made a mistake Shes the greatest of all the great Holbeins

I was relieved Ah then not Lady Beldonald But do I possess a Holbein
of _any_ price unawares

There she isthere she is Dear dear dear what a head And I saw
whom he meantand what a small old lady in a black dress and a black
bonnet both relieved with a little white who had evidently just
changed her place to reach a corner from which more of the room and of
the scene was presented to her She appeared unnoticed and unknown and
I immediately recognised that some other guest must have brought her and
for want of opportunity had as yet to call my attention to her But two
things simultaneously with this and with each other struck me with
force one of them the truth of Outreaus description of her the other
the fact that the person bringing her could only have been Lady
Beldonald She _was_ a Holbeinof the first water yet she was also
Mrs Brash the imported foil the indispensable accent the
successor to the dreary Miss Dadd By the time I had put these things
togetherOutreaus American having helped meI was in just such full
possession of her face as I had found myself on the other first
occasion of that of her patroness Only with so different a
consequence I couldnt look at her enough and I stared and stared till
I became aware she might have fancied me challenging her as a person
unpresented All the same Outreau went on equally held _cest une
tete a faire_ If I were only staying long enough for a crack at her
But I tell you whatand he seized my armbring her over

Over

To Paris Shed have a _succes fou_

Ah thanks my dear fellow I was now quite in a position to say shes
the handsomest thing in London andfor what I might do with her was
already before me with intensityI propose to keep her to myself It
was before me with intensity in the light of Mrs Brashs distant
perfection of a little white old face in which every wrinkle was the
touch of a master but something else I suddenly felt was not less so
for Lady Beldonald in the other quarter and though she couldnt have
made out the subject of our notice continued to fix us and her eyes had
the challenge of those of the woman of consequence who has missed
something A moment later I was close to her apologising first for not
having been more on the spot at her arrival but saying in the next
breath uncontrollably Why my dear lady its a Holbein

A Holbein What

Why the wonderful sharp old face so extraordinarily consummately
drawnin the frame of black velvet That of Mrs Brash I meanisnt
it her nameyour companion

This was the beginning of a most odd matterthe essence of my anecdote
and I think the very first note of the oddity must have sounded for me in
the tone in which her ladyship spoke after giving me a silent look It
seemed to come to me out of a distance immeasurably removed from Holbein
Mrs Brash isnt my companion in the sense you appear to mean Shes
my rather near relation and a very dear old friend I love herand you
must know her

Know her Rather Why to see her is to want on the spot to go for
her She also must sit for me

_She_ Louisa Brash If Lady Beldonald had the theory that her beauty
directly showed it when things werent well with her this impression
which the fixed sweetness of her serenity had hitherto struck me by no
means as justifying gave me now my first glimpse of its grounds It was
as if I had never before seen her face invaded by anything I should have
called an expression This expression moreover was of the faintestwas
like the effect produced on a surface by an agitation both deep within
and as yet much confused Have you told her so she then quickly
asked as if to soften the sound of her surprise

Dear no Ive but just noticed herOutreau a moment ago put me on her
But were both so taken and he also wants

To _paint_ her Lady Beldonald uncontrollably murmured

Dont be afraid we shall fight for her I returned with a laugh for
this tone Mrs Brash was still where I could see her without appearing
to stare and she mightnt have seen I was looking at her though her
protectress Im afraid could scarce have failed of that certainty We
must each take our turn and at any rate shes a wonderful thing so that
if youll let her go to Paris Outreau promises her there

_There_ my companion gasped

A career bigger still than among us as he considers we havent half
their eye He guarantees her _a succes fou_

She couldnt get over it Louisa Brash In Paris

They do see I went on more than we and they live extraordinarily
dont you know in that But shell do something here too

And what will she do

If frankly now I couldnt help giving Mrs Brash a longer look so after
it I could as little resist sounding my converser Youll see Only
give her time

She said nothing during the moment in which she met my eyes but then
Time it seems to me is exactly what you and your friend want If you
havent talked with her

We havent seen her Oh we see bang offwith a click like a steel
spring Its our trade its our life and we should be donkeys if we
made mistakes Thats the way I saw you yourself my lady if I may say
so thats the way with a long pin straight through your body Ive got
you And just so Ive got _her_

All this for reasons had brought my guest to her feet but her eyes had
while we talked never once followed the direction of mine You call her
a Holbein

Outreau did and I of course immediately recognised it Dont you She
brings the old boy to life Its just as I should call you a Titian You
bring _him_ to life

She couldnt be said to relax because she couldnt be said to have
hardened but something at any rate on this took place in hersomething
indeed quite disconnected from what I would have called her Dont you
understand that she has always been supposed It had the ring of
impatience nevertheless it stopped short on a scruple

I knew what it was however well enough to say it for her if she
preferred To be nothing whatever to look at To be unfortunately
plainor even if you like repulsively ugly Oh yes I understand it
perfectly just as I understandI have to as a part of my trademany
other forms of stupidity Its nothing new to one that ninetynine
people out of a hundred have no eyes no sense no taste There are
whole communities impenetrably sealed I dont say your friends a
person to make the men turn round in Regent Street But it adds to the
joy of the few who do see that they have it so much to themselves Where
in the world can she have lived You must tell me all about thator
rather if shell be so good _she_ must

You mean then to speak to her

I wondered as she pulled up again Of her beauty

Her beauty cried Lady Beldonald so loud that two or three persons
looked round

Ah with every precaution of respect I declared in a much lower tone
But her back was by this time turned to me and in the movement as it
were one of the strangest little dramas Ive ever known was well
launched




CHAPTER III


It was a drama of small smothered intensely private things and I knew of
but one other person in the secret yet that person and I found it
exquisitely susceptible of notation followed it with an interest the
mutual communication of which did much for our enjoyment and were
present with emotion at its touching catastrophe The small casefor so
small a casehad made a great stride even before my little party
separated and in fact within the next ten minutes

In that space of time two things had happened one of which was that I
made the acquaintance of Mrs Brash and the other that Mrs Munden
reached me cleaving the crowd with one of her usual pieces of news
What she had to impart was that on her having just before asked Nina if
the conditions of our sitting had been arranged with me Nina had
replied with something like perversity that she didnt propose to
arrange them that the whole affair was off again and that she
preferred not to be further beset for the present The question for Mrs
Munden was naturally what had happened and whether I understood Oh I
understood perfectly and what I at first most understood was that even
when I had brought in the name of Mrs Brash intelligence wasnt yet in
Mrs Munden She was quite as surprised as Lady Beldonald had been on
hearing of the esteem in which I held Mrs Brashs appearance She was
stupefied at learning that I had just in my ardour proposed to its
proprietress to sit to me Only she came round promptlywhich Lady
Beldonald really never did Mrs Munden was in fact wonderful for when
I had given her quickly Why shes a Holbein you know absolutely she
took it up after a first fine vacancy with an immediate abysmal Oh
_is_ she that as a piece of social gymnastics did her the greatest
honour and she was in fact the first in London to spread the tidings
For a faceabout it was magnificent But she was also the first I must
add to see what would really happenthough this she put before me only
a week or two later It will kill her my dearthats what it will
do

She meant neither more nor less than that it would kill Lady Beldonald if
I were to paint Mrs Brash for at this lurid light had we arrived in so
short a space of time It was for me to decide whether my aesthetic need
of giving life to my idea was such as to justify me in destroying it in a
woman after all in most eyes so beautiful The situation was indeed
sufficiently queer for it remained to be seen what I should positively
gain by giving up Mrs Brash I appeared to have in any case lost Lady
Beldonald now too upsetit was always Mrs Mundens word about her
and as I inferred her own about herselfto meet me again on our
previous footing The only thing I of course soon saw was to temporise
to drop the whole question for the present and yet so far as possible
keep each of the pair in view I may as well say at once that this plan
and this process gave their principal interest to the next several
months Mrs Brash had turned up if I remember early in the new year
and her little wonderful career was in our particular circle one of the
features of the following season It was at all events for myself the
most attaching its not my fault if I am so put together as often to
find more life in situations obscure and subject to interpretation than
in the gross rattle of the foreground And there were all sorts of
things things touching amusing mystifyingand above all such an
instance as I had never yet metin this funny little fortune of the
useful American cousin Mrs Munden was promptly at one with me as to
the rarity and to a near and human view the beauty and interest of the
position We had neither of us ever before seen that degree and that
special sort of personal success come to a woman for the first time so
late in life I found it an example of poetic of absolutely retributive
justice so that my desire grew great to work it as we say on those
lines I had seen it all from the original moment at my studio the poor
lady had never known an hours appreciationwhich moreover in perfect
good faith she had never missed The very first thing I did after
inducing so unintentionally the resentful retreat of her protectress had
been to go straight over to her and say almost without preliminaries that
I should hold myself immeasurably obliged for a few patient sittings
What I thus came face to face with was on the instant her whole
unenlightened past and the full if foreshortened revelation of what
among us all was now unfailingly in store for her To turn the handle
and start that tune came to me on the spot as a temptation Here was a
poor lady who had waited for the approach of old age to find out what she
was worth Here was a benighted being to whom it was to be disclosed in
her fiftyseventh yearI was to make that outthat she had something
that might pass for a face She looked much more than her age and was
fairly frightenedas if I had been trying on her some possibly heartless
London trickwhen she had taken in my appeal That showed me in what an
air she had lived andas I should have been tempted to put it had I
spoken outamong what children of darkness Later on I did them more
justice saw more that her wonderful points must have been points largely
the fruit of time and even that possibly she might never in all her life
have looked so well as at this particular moment It might have been
that if her hour had struck I just happened to be present at the
striking What had occurred all the same was at the worst a notable
comedy

The famous irony of fate takes many forms but I had never yet seen it
take quite this one She had been had over on an understanding and
she wasnt playing fair She had broken the law of her ugliness and had
turned beautiful on the hands of her employer More interesting even
perhaps than a view of the conscious triumph that this might prepare for
her and of which had I doubted of my own judgement I could still take
Outreaus fine start as the full guaranteemore interesting was the
question of the process by which such a history could get itself enacted
The curious thing was that all the while the reasons of her having passed
for plainthe reasons for Lady Beldonalds fond calculation which they
quite justifiedwere written large in her face so large that it was
easy to understand them as the only ones she herself had ever read What
was it then that actually made the old stale sentence mean something so
differentinto what new combinations what extraordinary language
unknown but understood at a glance had time and life translated it The
only thing to be said was that time and life were artists who beat us
all working with recipes and secrets we could never find out I really
ought to have like a lecturer or a showman a chart or a blackboard to
present properly the relation in the wonderful old tender battered
blanched face between the original elements and the exquisite final
style I could do it with chalks but I can scarcely do it with words
However the thing was for any artist who respected himself to _feel_
itwhich I abundantly did and then not to conceal from _her_ I felt
itwhich I neglected as little But she was really to do her complete
justice the last to understand and Im not sure that to the endfor
there was an endshe quite made it all out or knew where she was When
youve been brought up for fifty years on black it must be hard to adjust
your organism at a days notice to goldcolour Her whole nature had
been pitched in the key of her supposed plainness She had known how to
be uglyit was the only thing she had learnt save if possible how not
to mind it Being beautiful took in any case a new set of muscles It
was on the prior conviction literally that she had developed her
admirable dress instinctively felicitous always either black or white
and a matter of rather severe squareness and studied line She was
magnificently neat everything she showed had a way of looking both old
and fresh and there was on every occasion the same picture in her draped
headdraped in lowfalling blackand the fine white plaits of a
painters white somehow disposed on her chest What had happened was
that these arrangements determined by certain considerations lent
themselves in effect much better to certain others Adopted in mere shy
silence they had really only deepened her accent It was singular
moreover that so constituted there was nothing in her aspect of the
ascetic or the nun She was a good hard sixteenthcentury figure not
withered with innocence bleached rather by life in the open She was in
short just what we had made of her a Holbein for a great Museum and our
position Mrs Mundens and mine rapidly became that of persons having
such a treasure to dispose of The worldI speak of course mainly of
the artworldflocked to see it




CHAPTER IV


But has she any idea herself poor thing was the way I had put it to
Mrs Munden on our next meeting after the incident at my studio with the
effect however only of leaving my friend at first to take me as
alluding to Mrs Brashs possible prevision of the chatter she might
create I had my own sense of thatthis provision had been nil the
question was of her consciousness of the office for which Lady Beldonald
had counted on her and for which we were so promptly proceeding to spoil
her altogether

Oh I think she arrived with a goodish notion Mrs Munden had replied
when I had explained for shes clever too you know as well as good
looking and I dont see how if she ever really _knew_ Nina she could
have supposed for a moment that she wasnt wanted for whatever she might
have left to give up Hasnt she moreover always been made to feel that
shes ugly enough for anything It was even at this point already
wonderful how my friend had mastered the case and what lights alike for
its past and its future she was prepared to throw on it If she has
seen herself as ugly enough for anything she has seen herselfand that
was the only wayas ugly enough for Nina and she has had her own manner
of showing that she understands without making Nina commit herself to
anything vulgar Women are never without ways for doing such thingsboth
for communicating and receiving knowledgethat I cant explain to you
and that you wouldnt understand if I could since you must be a woman
even to do that I daresay theyve expressed it all to each other simply
in the language of kisses But doesnt it at any rate make something
rather beautiful of the relation between them as affected by our
discovery

I had a laugh for her plural possessive The point is of course that if
there was a conscious bargain and our action on Mrs Brash is to deprive
her of the sense of keeping her side of it various things may happen
that wont be good either for her or for ourselves She may
conscientiously throw up the position

Yes my companion musedfor she is conscientious Or Nina without
waiting for that may cast her forth

I faced it all Then we should have to keep her

As a regular model Mrs Munden was ready for anything Oh that would
be lovely

But I further worked it out The difficulty is that shes not a model
hang itthat shes too good for one that shes the very thing herself
When Outreau and I have each had our go that will be all therell be
nothing left for any one else Therefore it behoves us quite to
understand that our attitudes a responsibility If we cant do for her
positively more than Nina does

We must let her alone My companion continued to muse I see

Yet dont I returned see too much We _can_ do more

Than Nina She was again on the spot It wouldnt after all be
difficult We only want the directly opposite thingand which is the
only one the poor dear can give Unless indeed she suggested we
simply retractwe back out

I turned it over Its too late for that Whether Mrs Brashs peace
is gone I cant say But Ninas is

Yes and theres no way to bring it back that wont sacrifice her
friend We cant turn round and say Mrs Brash is ugly can we But
fancy Ninas not having _seen_ Mrs Munden exclaimed

She doesnt see now I answered She cant Im certain make out
what we mean The woman for _her_ still is just what she always was
But she has nevertheless had her stroke and her blindness while she
wavers and gropes in the dark only adds to her discomfort Her blow was
to see the attention of the world deviate

All the same I dont think you know my interlocutress said that
Nina will have made her a scene or that whatever we do shell ever make
her one That isnt the way it will happen for shes exactly as
conscientious as Mrs Brash

Then what is the way I asked

It will just happen in silence

And what will it as you call it be

Isnt that what we want really to see

Well I replied after a turn or two about whether we want it or not
its exactly what we _shall_ see which is a reason the more for
fancying between the pair therein the quiet exquisite house and full
of superiorities and suppressions as they both arethe extraordinary
situation If I said just now that its too late to do anything but
assent its because Ive taken the full measure of what happened at my
studio It took but a few momentsbut she tasted of the tree

My companion wondered Nina

Mrs Brash And to have to put it so ministered while I took yet
another turn to a sort of agitation Our attitude was a responsibility

But I had suggested something else to my friend who appeared for a
moment detached Should you say shell hate her worse if she _doesnt_
see

Lady Beldonald Doesnt see what we see you mean than if she does Ah
I give _that_ up I laughed But what I can tell you is why I hold
that as I said just now we can do most We can do this we can give to
a harmless and sensitive creature hitherto practically disinheritedand
give with an unexpectedness that will immensely add to its pricethe
pure joy of a deep draught of the very pride of life of an acclaimed
personal triumph in our superior sophisticated world

Mrs Munden had a glow of response for my sudden eloquence Oh it will
be beautiful




CHAPTER V


Well thats what on the whole and in spite of everything it really
was It has dropped into my memory a rich little gallery of pictures a
regular panorama of those occasions that were to minister to the view
from which I had so for a moment extracted a lyric inspiration I see
Mrs Brash on each of these occasions practically enthroned and
surrounded and more or less mobbed see the hurrying and the nudging and
the pressing and the staring see the people making up and introduced
and catch the word when they have had their turn hear it above all the
great oneAh yes the famous Holbeinpassed about with that
perfection of promptitude that makes the motions of the London mind so
happy a mixture of those of the parrot and the sheep Nothing would be
easier of course than to tell the whole little tale with an eye only for
that silly side of it Great was the silliness but great also as to this
case of poor Mrs Brash I will say for it the good nature Of course
furthermore it took in particular our set with its positive child
terror of the _banal_ to be either so foolish or so wise though indeed
Ive never quite known where our set begins and ends and have had to
content myself on this score with the indication once given me by a lady
next whom I was placed at dinner Oh its bounded on the north by Ibsen
and on the south by Sargent Mrs Brash never sat to me she absolutely
declined and when she declared that it was quite enough for her that I
had with that fine precipitation invited her I quite took this as she
meant it before we had gone very far our understanding hers and mine
was complete Her attitude was as happy as her success was prodigious
The sacrifice of the portrait was a sacrifice to the true inwardness of
Lady Beldonald and did much for the time I divined toward muffling
their domestic tension All it was thus in her power to sayand I heard
of a few cases of her having said itwas that she was sure I would have
painted her beautifully if she hadnt prevented me She couldnt even
tell the truth which was that I certainly would have done so if Lady
Beldonald hadnt and she never could mention the subject at all before
that personage I can only describe the affair naturally from the
outside and heaven forbid indeed that I should try too closely to
reconstruct the possible strange intercourse of these good friends at
home

My anecdote however would lose half the point it may have to show were
I to omit all mention of the consummate turn her ladyship appeared
gradually to have found herself able to give her deportment She had
made it impossible I should myself bring up our old our original
question but there was real distinction in her manner of now accepting
certain other possibilities Let me do her that justice her effort at
magnanimity must have been immense There couldnt fail of course to be
ways in which poor Mrs Brash paid for it How much she had to pay we
were in fact soon enough to see and its my intimate conviction that as
a climax her life at last was the price But while she lived at
leastand it was with an intensity for those wondrous weeks of which
she had never dreamedLady Beldonald herself faced the music This is
what I mean by the possibilities by the sharp actualities indeed that
she accepted She took our friend out she showed her at home never
attempted to hide or to betray her played her no trick whatever so long
as the ordeal lasted She drank deep on her side too of the cupthe
cup that for her own lips could only be bitterness There was I think
scarce a special success of her companions at which she wasnt
personally present Mrs Mundens theory of the silence in which all
this would be muffled for them was none the less and in abundance
confirmed by our observations The whole thing was to be the death of
one or the other of them but they never spoke of it at tea I remember
even that Nina went so far as to say to me once looking me full in the
eyes quite sublimely Ive made out what you meanshe _is_ a picture
The beauty of this moreover was that as Im persuaded she hadnt really
made it out at allthe words were the mere hypocrisy of her reflective
endeavour for virtue She couldnt possibly have made it out her friend
was as much as ever dreadfully plain to her she must have wondered to
the last what on earth possessed us Wouldnt it in fact have been after
all just this failure of vision this supreme stupidity in short that
kept the catastrophe so long at bay There was a certain sense of
greatness for her in seeing so many of us so absurdly mistaken and I
recall that on various occasions and in particular when she uttered the
words just quoted this high serenity as a sign of the relief of her
soreness if not of the effort of her conscience did something quite
visible to my eyes and also quite unprecedented for the beauty of her
face She got a real lift from itsuch a momentary discernible
sublimity that I recollect coming out on the spot with a queer crude
amused Do you know I believe I could paint you _now_

She was a fool not to have closed with me then and there for what has
happened since has altered everythingwhat was to happen a little later
was so much more than I could swallow This was the disappearance of the
famous Holbein from one day to the otherproducing a consternation among
us all as great as if the Venus of Milo had suddenly vanished from the
Louvre She has simply shipped her straight backthe explanation was
given in that form by Mrs Munden who added that any cord pulled tight
enough would end at last by snapping At the snap in any case we
mightily jumped for the masterpiece we had for three or four months been
living with had made us feel its presence as a luminous lesson and a
daily need We recognised more than ever that it had been for high
finish the gem of our collectionwe found what a blank it left on the
wall Lady Beldonald might fill up the blank but we couldnt That she
did soon fill it upand heaven help us _how_ was put before me after
an interval of no great length but during which I hadnt seen her I
dined on the Christmas of last year at Mrs Mundens and Nina with a
scratch lot as our hostess said was there so that the preliminary
wait being longish she could approach me very sweetly Ill come to
you tomorrow if you like she said and the effect of it after a first
stare at her was to make me look all round I took in by these two
motions two things one of which was that though now again so satisfied
herself of her high state she could give me nothing comparable to what I
should have got had she taken me up at the moment of my meeting her on
her distinguished concession the other that she was suited afresh and
that Mrs Brashs successor was fully installed Mrs Brashs successor
was at the other side of the room and I became conscious that Mrs
Munden was waiting to see my eyes seek her I guessed the meaning of the
wait what was one this time to say Oh first and foremost assuredly
that it was immensely droll for this time at least there was no mistake
The lady I looked upon and as to whom my friend again quite at sea
appealed to me for a formula was as little a Holbein or a specimen of
any other school as she was like Lady Beldonald herself a Titian The
formula was easy to give for the amusement was that her prettinessyes
literally prodigiously her prettinesswas distinct Lady Beldonald
had been magnificenthad been almost intelligent Miss Whatshername
continues pretty continues even young and doesnt matter a straw She
matters so ideally little that Lady Beldonald is practically safer I
judge than she has ever been There hasnt been a symptom of chatter
about this person and I believe her protectress is much surprised that
were not more struck

It was at any rate strictly impossible to me to make an appointment for
the day as to which I have just recorded Ninas proposal and the turn of
events since then has not quickened my eagerness Mrs Munden remained
in correspondence with Mrs Brashto the extent that is of three
letters each of which she showed me They so told to our imagination
her terrible little story that we were quite preparedor thought we
werefor her going out like a snuffed candle She resisted on her
return to her original conditions less than a year the taste of the
tree as I had called it had been fatal to her what she had contentedly
enough lived without before for half a century she couldnt now live
without for a day I know nothing of her original conditionssome minor
American citysave that for her to have gone back to them was clearly to
have stepped out of her frame We performed Mrs Munden and I a small
funeral service for her by talking it all over and making it all out It
wasntthe minor American citya market for Holbeins and what had
occurred was that the poor old picture banished from its museum and
refreshed by the rise of no new movement to hang it was capable of the
miracle of a silent revolution of itself turning in its dire dishonour
its face to the wall So it stood without the intervention of the ghost
of a critic till they happened to pull it round again and find it mere
dead paint Well it had had if thats anything its season of fame
its name on a thousand tongues and printed in capitals in the catalogue
We hadnt been at fault I havent all the same the least note of
hernot a scratch And I did her so in intention Mrs Munden
continues to remind me however that this is not the sort of rendering
with which on the other side after all Lady Beldonald proposes to
content herself She has come back to the question of her own portrait
Let me settle it then at last Since she _will_ have the real
thingwell hang it she shall
