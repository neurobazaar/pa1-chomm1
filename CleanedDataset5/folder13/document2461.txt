PREFACE

An indistinct recollection of the very pretty little tale called The
BellowsMender suggested the plot of this Drama The incidents are
however greatly altered from those in the tale and the characters
entirely recast

Having long had a wish to illustrate certain periods of the French
history so in the selection of the date in which the scenes of this
play are laid I saw that the era of the Republic was that in which the
incidents were rendered most probable in which the probationary career
of the hero could well be made sufficiently rapid for dramatic effect
and in which the character of the time itself was depicted by the
agencies necessary to the conduct of the narrative For during the early
years of the first and most brilliant successes of the French Republic
in the general ferment of society and the brief equalization of ranks
Claudes highplaced love his ardent feelings his unsettled principles
the struggle between which makes the passion of this drama his
ambition and his career were phenomena that characterized the age and
in which the spirit of the nation went along with the extravagance of
the individual

The play itself was composed with a twofold object In the first place
sympathizing with the enterprise of Mr Macready as Manager of Covent
Garden and believing that many of the higher interests of the Drama
were involved in the success or failure of an enterprise equally
hazardous and disinterested I felt if I may so presume to express
myself something of the Brotherhood of Art and it was only for Mr
Macready to think it possible that I might serve him in order to induce
me to make the attempt

Secondly in that attempt I was mainly anxious to see whether or
not after the comparative failure on the stage of The Duchess de la
Valliere certain critics had truly declared that it was not in my
power to attain the art of dramatic construction and theatrical effect
I felt indeed that it was in this that a writer accustomed to the
narrative class of composition would have the most both to learn and
unlearn Accordingly it was to the development of the plot and the
arrangement of the incidents that I directed my chief attentionand I
sought to throw whatever belongs to poetry less into the diction and
the felicity of words than into the construction of the story the
creation of the characters and the spirit of the pervading sentiment

The authorship of the play was neither avowed nor suspected until the
play had established itself in public favor The announcement of my
name was the signal for attacks chiefly political to which it is now
needless to refer When a work has outlived for some time the earlier
hostilities of criticism there comes a new race of critics to which a
writer may for the most part calmly trust for a fair consideration
whether of the faults or the merits of his performance

who rises disdainfullyMademoiselle I have ventured to wait upon
you in a hope that you must long since have divined Last night when
you outshone all the beauty of Lyons you completed your conquest
over me You know that my fortune is not exceeded by any estate in the
provinceyou know that but for the Revolution which has defrauded
me of my titles I should be noble May I then trust that you will not
reject my alliance I offer you my hand and heart

Pauline aside He has the air of a man who confers a favorAloud
Sir you are very condescendingI thank you humbly but being duly
sensible of my own demerits you must allow me to decline the honor you
propose Curtsies and turns away

Beau Decline Impossibleyou are not seriousMadam suffer me to
appeal to you I am a suitor for your daughters handthe settlements
shall be worthy of her beauty and my station May I wait on M
Deschappelles

Mme Deschap M Deschappelles never interferes in the domestic
arrangementsyou are very obliging If you were still a marquis or if
my daughter were intended to marry a commonerwhy perhaps we might
give you the preference

Beau A commonerwe are all commoners in France now

Mme Deschap In France yes but there is a nobility still left in the
other countries in Europe We are quite aware of your good qualities
and dont doubt that you will find some lady more suitable to your
pretensions We shall be always happy to see you as an acquaintance M
BeauseantMy dear child the carriage will be here presently

Beau Say no more madamsay no moreAside Refused and by
a merchants daughterrefused It will be all over Lyons before
sunsetI will go and bury myself in my chateau study philosophy
and turn womanhater Refused they ought to be sent to a madhouse
Ladies I have the honor to wish you a very good morning Exit

Mme Deschap How forward these men areI think child we kept up our
dignity Any girl however inexperienced knows how to accept an
offer but it requires a vast deal of address to refuse one with proper
condescension and disdain I used to practise it at school with the
dancingmaster

Enter DAMAS

Damas Good morning cousin DeschappellesWell Pauline are you
recovered from last nights ballSo many triumphs must be very
fatiguing Even M Glavis sighed most piteously when you departed but
that might be the effect of the supper

Pauline M Glavis indeed

Mme Deschap M Glavisas if my daughter would think of M Glavis

Damas Heydaywhy notHis father left him a very pretty fortune
and his birth is higher than yours cousin Deschappelles But perhaps
you are looking to M Beauseanthis father was a marquis before the
Revolution

Pauline M BeauseantCousin you delight in tormenting me

Mme Deschap Dont mind him PaulineCousin Damas you have no
susceptibility of feelingthere is a certain indelicacy in all your
ideasM Beauseant knows already that he is no match for my daughter

Damas Pooh pooh one would think you intended your daughter to marry a
prince

Mme Deschap Well and if I didwhat thenMany a foreign prince

Damas interrupting her Foreign princeforeign fiddlestickyou
ought to be ashamed of such nonsense at your time of life

Mme Deschap My time of lifeThat is an expression never applied to
any lady till she is sixtynine and threequartersand only then by
the clergyman of the parish

Enter Servant

Servant Madame the carriage is at the door Exit

Mme Deschap Come child put on your bonnetyou really have a very
thoroughbred airnot at all like your poor fatherFondly Ah you
little coquette when a young lady is always making mischief it is a
sure sign that she takes after her mother

Pauline Good day cousin Damasand a better humor to youGoing
back to the table and taking the flowers Who could have sent me these
flowers Exeunt PAULINE and MADAME DESCHAPPELLES

Damas That would be an excellent girl if her head had not been turned
I fear she is now become incorrigible Zounds what a lucky fellow I am
to be still a bachelor They may talk of the devotion of the sexbut
the most faithful attachment in life is that of a woman in lovewith
herself Exit

SCENE II

The exterior of a small Village Innsign the Golden LionA few
leagues from Lyons which is seen at a distance

Beau behind the scenes Yes you may bait the horses we shall rest
here an hour

Enter BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS

Gla Really my dear Beauseant consider that I have promised to spend
a day or two with you at your chateau that I am quite at your mercy for
my entertainmentand yet you are as silent and as gloomy as a mute at
a funeral or an Englishman at a party of pleasure

Beau Bear with methe fact is that I am miserable

Gla Youthe richest and gayest bachelor in Lyons

Beau It is because I am a bachelor that I am miserableThou knowest
Paulinethe only daughter of the rich merchant Mons Deschappelles

Gla Know herwho does notas pretty as Venus and as proud as Juno

Beau Her taste is worse than her prideDrawing himself up Know
Glavis she has actually refused me

Gla aside So she has mevery consoling In all cases of
heartache the application of another mans disappointment draws
out the pain and allays the irritationAloud Refused you and
wherefore

Beau I know not unless it be because the Revolution swept away my
fathers title of Marquisand she will not marry a commoner Now as
we have no noblemen left in Franceas we are all citizens and equals
she can only hope that in spite of the war some English Milord or
German Count will risk his life by coming to Lyons that this fille du
Roturier may condescend to accept him Refused me and with scornBy
Heaven Ill not submit to it tamelyIm in a perfect fever of
mortification and rageRefuse me indeed

Gla Be comforted my dear fellowI will tell you a secret For the
same reason she refused ME

Beau Youthats a very different matter But give me your hand
Glaviswell think of some plan to humble her Mille diables I should
like to see her married to a strolling player

Enter Landlord and his Daughter from the Inn

Beau You raise my curiosityproceed

Land Well then about four years ago old Melnotte died and left his
son well to do in the world We then all observed that a great change
came over young Claude he took to reading and Latin and hired a
professor from Lyons who had so much in his head that he was forced to
wear a great fullbottom wig to cover it Then he took a fencingmaster
and a dancingmaster and a musicmaster and then he learned to paint
and at last it was said that young Claude was to go to Paris and set
up for a painter The lads laughed at him at first but he is a stout
fellow is Claude and as brave as a lion and soon taught them to laugh
the wrong side of their mouths and now all the boys swear by him and
all the girls pray for him

Beau A promising youth certainly And why do they call him Prince

Land Partly because he is at the head of them all and partly because
he has such a proud way with him and wears such fine clothesand in
short looks like a prince

Beau And what could have turned the foolish fellows brain The
Revolution I suppose

Land Yesthe revolution that turns us all topsyturvythe revolution
of Love

Beau Romantic young Corydon And with whom is he in love

person than the Beauty of Lyons Pauline Deschappelles

Land You may laugh but it is as true as I stand here

Beau And what does the Beauty of Lyons say to his suit

Land Lord sir she never even condescended to look at him though when
he was a boy he worked in her fathers garden

Beau Are you sure of that

Land His mother says that Mademoiselle does not know him by sight

Beau taking Glavis aside I have hit itI have it here is our
revenge Here is a prince for our haughty damsel Do you take me

Gla Deuce take me if I do

elegant clown pass himself off as a foreign princelend him money

Pauline Would it not be delicious

Gla With all my heartbut the dinner

ACT IISCENE I

The Gardens of M DESCHAPPELLEs house at Lyonsthe house seen at the
back of the stage

Enter BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS

Beau Well what think you of my plot Has it not succeeded to a
miracle The instant that I introduced his Highness the Prince of Como
to the pompous mother and the scornful daughter it was all over with
them he camehe sawhe conquered and though it is not many days
since he arrived they have already promised him the hand of Pauline

Gla It is lucky though that you told them his highness travelled
incognito for fear the Directory who are not very fond of princes
should lay him by the heels for he has a wonderful wish to keep up his
rank and scatters our gold about with as much coolness as if he were
watering his own flowerpots

Beau True he is damnably extravagant I think the sly dog does it out
of malice How ever it must be owned that he reflects credit on his
loyal subjects and makes a very pretty figure in his fine clothes with
my diamond snuffbox

Gla And my diamond ring But do you think he will be firm to the last
I fancy I see symptoms of relenting he will never keep up his rank if
he once let out his conscience

Beau His oath binds him he cannot retract without being foresworn
and those low fellows are always superstitious But as it is I tremble
lest he be discovered that bluff Colonel Damas Madame Deschappelles
cousin evidently suspects him we must make haste and conclude the
farce I have thought of a plan to end it this very day

Gla This very day Poor Pauline her dream will be soon over

Beau Yes this day they shall be married this evening according to
his oath he shall carry his bride to the Golden Lion and then pomp
equipage retinue and title all shall vanish at once and her Highness
the Princess shall find that she has refused the son of a Marquis to
marry the son of a gardenerOh Pauline once loved now hated yet
still not relinquished thou shalt drain the cup to the dregsthou
shalt know what it is to be humbled

Enter from the house MELNOTTE as the Prince of Como leading in
PAULINE MADAME

BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS bow respectfully fully PAULINE and MELNOTTE walk

Mme Deschap Good morning gentlemen really I am so fatigued with
laughter the dear Prince is so entertaining What wit he has Any one
may see that he has spent his whole life in courts

Damas And what the deuce do you know about courts cousin
Deschappelles You women regard men just as you buy booksyou never
care about what is in them but how they are bound and lettered
Sdeath I dont think you would even look at your Bible if it had not a
title to it

Mme Deschap How coarse you are cousin Damasquite the manners of a
barrackyou dont deserve to be one of our family really we must drop
your acquaintance when Pauline marries I cannot patronize any relations
that would discredit my future soninlaw the Prince of Como

Mel advancing These are beautiful gardens madame BEAUSEANT and
GLAVIS retirewho planned them

Mme Deschap A gardener named Melnotte your highnessan honest man
who knew his station I cant say as much for his sona presuming

Pauline Yes how you would have laughed at them Prince you who write
such beautiful verses

Mel This Melnotte must be a monstrous impudent person

Damas Is he goodlooking

Mme Deschap I never notice such canaillean ugly meanlooking clown
if I remember right

Damas Yet I heard your porter say he was wonderfully like his highness

Mel taking snuff You are complimentary

Mme Deschap For shame cousin Damaslike the Prince indeed

Pauline Like you Ah mother like our beautiful prince Ill never
speak to you again cousin Damas

Mel aside Humphrank is a great beautifier I never passed for
an Apollo while I was a peasant if I am so handsome as a prince what
should I be as an emperor Aloud Monsieur Beauseant will you honor
me Offers snuff

Beau No your highness I have no small vices

Mel Nay if it were a vice youd be sure to have it Monsieur
Beauseant

Mme Deschap Ha hahow very severewhat wit

Beau in a rage and aside Curse his impertinence

Mme Deschap What a superb snuffbox Pauline And what a beautiful
ring

Mel You like the boxa trifleinteresting perhaps from associations
a present from Louis XIV to my greatgreat grandmother Honor me
byaccepting it

Beau plucking him by the sleeve Howwhat the devil My boxare you
mad It is worth five hundred louis

Mel unheeding him and turning to PAULINE And you like this ring
Ah it has indeed a lustre since your eyes have shone on it placing it
on her finger Henceforth hold me sweet enchantress the Slave of the
Ring

Gla pulling him Stay staywhat are you about My maiden aunts
legacya diamond of the first water You shall be hanged for swindling
sir

Mel pretending not to hear It is curious this ring it is the one
with which my grandfather the Doge of Venice married the Adriatic

Madame and PAULINE examine the ring Mel to BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS
Fie gentlemen princes must be generousTurns to DAMAS who watches
them closely These kind friends have my interest so much at heart
that they are as careful of my property as if it were their own

Beau and Gla confusedly Ha havery good joke that

Appears to remonstrate with MELNOTTE in dumb show

Damas Whats all that whispering I am sure there is some juggle here
hang me if I think he is an Italian after all Gad Ill try him
Servitore umillissimo Eccellenza  Your Excellencys most humble
servant

Mel Humwhat does he mean I wonder

Damas Godo di vedervi in buona salute  I am glad to see you in good
health

Mel Hemhem

Damas Fa bel tempothe si dice di nuovo   Fine weather What news

Mel Well sir whats all that gibberish

Damas Oh ohonly Italian your highnessThe Prince of Como does
not understand his own language

Mel Not as you pronounce it who the deuce could

Mme Deschap Ha ha cousin Damas never pretend to what you dont
know

Pauline Ha ha cousin Damas you speak Italian indeed

Makes a mocking gesture at him

Beau to GLAVIS Clever doghow ready

Gla Ready yes with my diamond ringDamn his readiness

Damas Laugh at melaugh at a Colonel in the French armythe
fellows an impostor I know he is Ill see if he understands fighting
as well as he does ItalianGoes up to him and aside Sir you are a
jackanapesCan you construe that

Mel No sir I never construe affronts in the presence of ladies
byandby I shall be happy to take a lessonor give one

Damas Ill find the occasion never fear

Mme Deschap Where are you going cousin

Damas To correct my Italian Exit

Beau to GLAVIS Let us after and pacify him he evidently suspects
something

Gla Yesbut my diamond ring

Beau And my boxWe are overtaxed fellowsubjectswe must stop the
supplies and dethrone the prince

Gla Princehe ought to be heirapparent to King Stork

Exeunt BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS

Mme Deschap Dare I ask your highness to forgive my cousins
insufferable vulgarity

Pauline Oh yesyou will forgive his manner for the sake of his heart

Mel And the sake of his cousinAh madam there is one comfort in
rankwe are so sure of our position that we are not easily affronted
Besides M Damas has bought the right of indulgence from his friends
by never showing it to his enemies

Pauline Ah he is indeed as brave in action as he is rude in speech
He rose from the ranks to his present grade and in two years

Mel In two yearstwo years did you say

Mme Deschap aside I dont like leaving girls alone with their
lovers but with a prince it would be so illbred to be prudish
Exit

Mel You can be proud of your connection with one who owes his position
to meritnot birth

Pauline Why yes but still

Mel Still what Pauline

Pauline There is something glorious in the heritage of command A man
who has ancestors is like a representative of the past

Mel True but like other representatives nine times out of ten he is
a silent member Ah Pauline not to the past but to the future looks
true nobility and finds its blazon in posterity

Pauline You say this to please me who have no ancestors but you
prince must be proud of so illustrious a race

Mel No no I would not were I fifty times a prince be a pensioner
on the dead I honor birth and ancestry when they are regarded as the
incentives to exertion not the titledeeds to sloth I honor the laurels
that overshadow the graves of our fathers it is our fathers I emulate
when I desire that beneath the evergreen I myself have planted my own
ashes may repose Dearest couldst thou but see with my eyes

Pauline I cannot forego pride when I look on thee and think that thou
lovest me Sweet Prince tell me again of thy palace by the Lake of
Como it is so pleasant to hear of thy splendors since thou didst
swear to me that they would be desolate without Pauline and when thou
describest them it is with a mocking lip and a noble scorn as if
custom had made thee disdain greatness

Mel Nay dearest nay if thou wouldst have me paint The home to which
could love fulfil its prayers This hand would lead thee listen

  The reader will observe that Melnotte evades the request
 of Pauline He proceeds to describe a home which he does
 not say he possesses but to which he would lead her could
 Love fulfil its prayers This caution is intended as a
 reply to a sagacious critic who censures the description
 because it is not an exact and prosaic inventory of the
 characteristics of the Lake of ComoWhen Melnotte for
 instance talks of birds that syllable the name of Pauline
 by the way a literal translation from an Italian poet he
 is not thinking of ornithology but probably of the Arabian
 Nights He is venting the extravagant but natural
 enthusiasm of the poet and the lover

 A deep vale
 Shut out by Alphine hills from the rude world
 Near a clear lake margind by fruits of gold
 And whispering myrtles glassing softest skies
 As cloudless save with rare and roseate shadows
 As I would have thy fate

 Pauline My own dear love

 Mel A palace lifting to eternal summer
 Its marble walls from out a glossy bower
 Of coolest foliage musical with birds
 Whose songs should syllable thy name At noon
 Wed sit beneath the arching vines and wonder
 Why Earth could be unhappy while the Heavens
 Still left us youth and love Wed have no friends
 That were not lovers no ambition save
 To excel them all in love wed read no books
 That were not tales of lovethat we might smile
 To think how poorly eloquence of words
 Translates the poetry of hearts like ours
 And when night came amidst the breathless Heavens
 Wed guess what star should be our home when love
 Becomes immortal while the perfumed light
 Stole through the mists of alabaster lamps
 And every air was heavy with the sighs
 Of orangegroves and music from sweet lutes
 And murmurs of low fountains that gush forth
 I the midst of rosesDost thou like the picture

 Pauline Oh as the bee upon the flower I hang
 Upon the honey of thy eloquent tongue
 Am I not blest And if I love too wildly
 Who would not love thee like Pauline

 Mel bitterly Oh false one
 It is the prince thou lovest not the man
 If in the stead of luxury pomp and power
 I had painted poverty and toil and care
 Thou hadst found no honey on my tonguePauline
 That is not love

 Pauline Thou wrongst me cruel Prince
 At first in truth I might not have been won
 Save through the weakness of a flatterd pride
 But nowoh trust mecouldst thou fall from power
 And sink

 Mel As low as that poor gardeners son
 Who dared to lift his eyes to thee

 Pauline Even then
 Methinks thou wouldst be only made more dear
 By the sweet thought that I could prove how deep
 Is womans love We are like the insects caught
 By the poor glittering of a garish flame
 But oh the wings once scorchd the brightest star
 Lures us no more and by the fatal light
 We cling till death

 Mel Angel Aside O conscience conscience
 It must not be her love hath grown a torture
 Worse than her hate I will at once to Beauseant
 Andha he comes Sweet love one moment leave me
 I have business with these gentlemenII
 Will forwith join you

Pauline Do not tarry long Exit

SCENE II

MELNOTTES cottageWidow bustling abouta table spread for supper

Widow So I think that looks very neat He sent me a line so blotted
that I can scarcely read it to say he would be here almost immediately
She must have loved him well indeed to have forgotten his birth for
though he was introduced to her in disguise he is too honorable not to
have revealed to her the artifice which her love only could forgive
Well I do not wonder at it for though my son is not a prince he ought
to be one and thats almost as good Knock at the door Ah here they
are

Enter MELNOTTE and PAULINE

Widow Oh my boythe pride of my heartwelcome welcome I beg
pardon maam but I do love him so

Pauline Good woman I reallywhy prince what is thisdoes the old
lady know you Oh I guess you have done her some service Another
proof of your kind heart is it not

Mel Of my kind heart ay

Pauline So you know the prince

Widow Know him madamAh I begin to fear it is you who know him not

Pauline Do you think she is mad Can we stay here my lord I think
theres something very wild about her

Mel Madam Ino I cannot tell her my knees knock together what a
coward is a man who has lost his honor Speak to herspeak to her to
his mothertell her thatO Heaven that I were dead

Pauline How confused he looksthis strange placethis womanwhat
can it meanI half suspectWho are you madamwho are you cant
you speak are you struck dumb

Widow Claude you have not deceived herAh shame upon you I
thought that before you went to the altar she was to have known all

Pauline All whatMy blood freezes in my veins

Widow Poor ladydare I tell her Claude MELNOTTE makes a sign of
assent Know you not then madam that this young man is of poor though
honest parents Know you not that you are wedded to my son Claude
Melnotte

Pauline Your son holdhold do not speak to meApproaches
MELNOTTE and lays her hand on his armIs this a jest is it I know
it is only speakone wordone look one smile I cannot believeI
who loved thee soI cannot believe that thou art such aNo I will not
wrong thee by a harsh wordSpeak

Mel Leave ushave pity on her on me leave us

Widow Oh Claude that I should live to see thee bowed by shame thee
of whom I was so proud Exit by the staircase

Pauline Her sonher son

Mel Now lady hear me

Pauline Hear thee Ay speakher son have fiends a parent speak
That thou mayst silence cursesspeak

Mel No curse me Thy curse would blast me less than thy forgiveness

 Pauline laughing wildly
 This is thy palace where the perfumed light
 Steals through the mist of alabaster lamps
 And every air is heavy with the sighs
 Of orangegroves and music from the sweet lutes
 And murmurs of low fountains that gush forth
 I the midst of roses Dost thou like the picture
 This is my bridal home and thou my bridegroom
 O foolO dupeO wretchI see it all
 Thy byword and the jeer of every tongue
 In Lyons Hast thou in thy heart one touch
 Of human kindness if thou hast why kill me
 And save thy wife from madness No it cannot
 It cannot be this is some horrid dream
 I shall wake soonTouching him Art flesh art man or but
 The shadows seen in sleep It is too real
 What have I done to thee how sinnd against thee
 That thou shouldst crush me thus

 Mel Pauline by pride
 Angels have fallen ere thy time by pride
 That sole alloy of thy most lovely mould
 The evil spirit of a bitter love
 And a revengeful heart had power upon thee
 From my first years my soul was filld with thee
 I saw thee midst the flowrs the lowly boy
 Tended unmarkd by theea spirit of bloom
 And joy and freshness as if Spring itself
 Were made a living thing and wore thy shape
 I saw thee and the passionate heart of man
 Enterd the breast of the wilddreaming boy
 And from that hour I grewwhat to the last
 I shall bethine adorer Well this love
 Vain frantic guilty if thou wilt became
 A fountain of ambition and bright hope
 I thought of tales that by the winter hearth
 Old gossips tellhow maidens sprung from kings
 Have stoopd from their high sphere how love like death
 Levels all ranks and lays the shepherds crook
 Beside the sceptre Thus I made my home
 In the soft palace of a fairy Future
 My father died and I the peasantborn
 Was my own lord Then did I seek to rise
 Out of the prison of my mean estate
 And with such jewels as the exploring mind
 Brings from the caves of knowledge buy my ransom
 From those twin gaolers of the daring heart
 Low birth and iron fortune Thy bright image
 Glassd in my soul took all the hues of glory
 And lured me on to those inspiring toils
 By which man masters men For thee I grew
 A midnight student oer the dreams of sages
 For thee I sought to borrow from each grace
 And every muse such attributes as lend
 Ideal charms to love I thought of thee
 And passion taught me poesyof thee
 And on the painters canvas grew the life
 Of beauty Art became the shadow
 Of the dear starlight of thy haunting eyes
 Men calld me vainsome madI heeded not
 But still toild onhoped onfor it was sweet
 If not to win to feel more worthy thee

 Pauline Has he a magic to exorcise hate

 Mel At last in one mad hour I dared to pour
 The thoughts that burst their channels into song
 And sent them to theesuch a tribute lady
 As beauty rarely scorns even from the meanest
 The nameappended by the burning heart
 That longd to show its idol what bright things
 It had createdyea the enthusiasts name
 That should have been thy triumph was thy scorn
 That very hourwhen passion turnd to wrath
 Resembled hatred mostwhen thy disdain
 Made my whole soul a chaosin that hour
 The tempters found me a revengeful tool
 For their revenge Thou hadst trampled on the worm
 It turnd and stung thee

 Pauline Love sir hath no sting
 What was the slight of a poor powerless girl
 To the deep wrong of this most vile revenge
 Oh how I loved this mana serfa slave

 Mel Hold lady No not slave Despair is free
 I will not tell thee of the throesthe struggles
 The anguishthe remorse No let it pass
 And let me come to such most poor atonement
 Yet in my power Pauline

 Approaching her with great emotion and about to take her hand

 Pauline No touch me not
 I know my fate You are by law my tyrant
 And IO Heavena peasants wife Ill work
 Toildrudgedo what thou wiltbut touch me not
 Let my wrongs make me sacred

 Mel Do not fear me
 Thou dost not know me madam at the altar
 My vengeance ceasedmy guilty oath expired
 Henceforth no image of some marble saint
 Niched in cathedral aisles is hallowd more
 From the rude hand of sacrilegious wrong
 I am thy husbandnay thou needst not shudder
 Here at thy feet I lay a husbands rights
 A marriage thus unholyunfulfilld
 A bond of fraudis by the laws of France
 Made void and null Tonight sleepsleep in peace
 Tomorrow pure and virgin as this morn
 I bore thee bathed in blushes from the shrine
 Thy fathers arms shall take thee to thy home
 The law shall do thee justice and restore
 Thy right to bless another with thy love
 And when thou art happy and hast half forgot
 Him who so lovedso wrongd thee think at least
 Heaven left some remnant of the angel still
 In that poor peasants nature

 Ho my mother Enter Widow

 Conduct this ladyshe is not my wife
 She is our guestour honord guest my mother

 Beneath the touch of my abhorred love
 Places her on a seat Therewe are strangers now

ACT V

Two years and a half from the date of Act IV

SCENE I

The Streets of Lyons

Enter First Second and Third Officers

First Officer Well here we are at Lyons with gallant old Damas it is
his native place

Second Officer Yes he has gained a step in the army since he was here
last The Lyonnese ought to be very proud of stout General Damas

Third Officer Promotion is quick in the French army This
mysterious Morierthe hero of Lodi and the favorite of the
commanderinchiefhas risen to a colonels rank to two years and a
half Enter DAMAS as a General

Damas Good morrow gentlemen I hope you will amuse yourselves during
our short stay at Lyons It is a fine city improved since I left it
Ah it is a pleasure to grow old when the years that bring decay to
ourselves do but ripen the prosperity of our country You have not met
with Morier

First Officer No we were just speaking of him

Second Officer Pray general can you tell us who this Morier really
is

Damas Iswhy a colonel in the French army

Third Officer True But what was he at first

Damas At first Why a baby in long clothes I suppose

First Officer Ha ha Ever facetious general

Second Officer to Third The general is sore upon this point you
will only chafe himAny commands general

Damas None Good day to you Exeunt Second and Third Officers

Damas Our comrades are very inquisitive Poor Morier is the subject of
a vast deal of curiosity

First Officer Say interest rather general His constant melancholy
the loneliness of his habitshis daring valor his brilliant rise
in the professionyour friendship and the favors of the
commanderinchiefall tend to make him as much the matter of gossip
as of admiration But where is he general I have missed him all the
morning

Damas Why captain Ill let you into a secret My young friend has
come with me to Lyons in hopes of finding a miracle

First Officer A miracle

Damas Yes a miracle in other wordsa constant woman

First Officer Oh an affair of love

Damas Exactly so No sooner did he enter Lyons than he waved his hand
to me threw himself from his horse and is now I warrant asking every
one who can know anything about the matter whether a certain lady is
still true to a certain gentleman

First Officer Success to him and of that success there can be no
doubt The gallant Colonel Morier the hero of Lodi might make his
choice out of the proudest families in France

Damas Oh if pride be a recommendation the lady and her mother are
most handsomely endowed By the way captain if you should chance to
meet with Morier tell him he will find me at the hotel

First Officer I will general Exit

Damas Now will I go to the Deschappelles and make a report to my young
Colonel Ha by Mars Bacchus Apollo Virorumhere comes Monsieur
Beauseant

Enter BEAUSEANT

Good morrow Monsieur Beauseant How fares it with you

Beau aside Damas that is unfortunateif the Italian campaign
should have filled his pockets he may seek to baffle me in the moment
of my victory Aloud Your servant generalfor such I think is
your new distinction Just arrived in Lyons

Damas Not an hour ago Well how go on the Deschappelles Have they
forgiven you in that affair of young Melnotte You had some hand in that
notable deviceeh

Beau Why less than you think for The fellow imposed upon me I have
set it all right now What has become of him He could not have joined
the army after all There is no such name in the books

Damas I know nothing about Melnotte As you say I never heard the name
in the Grand Army

Beau HemYou are not married general

Damas Do I look like a married man sirNo thank Heaven My
profession is to make widows not wives

Beau You must have gained much booty in Italy Pauline will be your
heiresseh

Damas Booty Not I Heiress to what Two trunks and a portmanteau
four horsesthree swords two suits of regimentals and six pair of
white leather inexpressibles A pretty fortune for a young lady

Beau aside Then all is safe Aloud Ha ha Is that really all
your capital General Damas Why I thought Italy had been a second
Mexico to you soldiers

Damas All a tossup sir I was not one of the lucky ones My friend
Morier indeed saved something handsome But our commanderinchief
took care of him and Morier is a thrifty economical dognot like the
rest of us soldiers who spend our money as carelessly as if it were our
blood

Beau Well it is no matter I do not want fortune with Pauline And you
must know General Damas that your fair cousin has at length consented
to reward my long and ardent attachment

Damas Youthe devil Why she is already married There is no
divorce

Beau True but this very day she is formally to authorize the necessary
proceedings this very day she is to sign the contract that is to make
her mine within one week from the day on which her present illegal
marriage is annulled

Damas You tell me wondersWonders No I believe anything of women

Beau I must wish you good morning As he is going enter
DESCHAPPELLES

M Deschap Oh Beauseant well met Let us come to the notary at once

Damas to Deschap Why cousin

M Deschap Damas welcome to Lyons Pray call on us my wife will be
delighted to see you

Damas Your wife beblessed for her condescension But taking him
aside what do I hear Is it possible that your daughter has consented
to a divorcethat she will marry Monsieur Beauseant

M Deschap Certainly What have you to say against it A gentleman of
birth fortune character We are not so proud as we were even my wife
has had enough of nobility and princes

Damas But Pauline loved that young man so tenderly

M Deschap taking snuff That was two years and a half ago

Damas Very true Poor Melnotte

M Deschap But do not talk of that impostor I hope he is dead or has
left the country Nay even were he in Lyons at this moment he ought
to rejoice that in an honorable and suitable alliance my daughter may
forget her sufferings and his crime

DamasNay if it be all settled I have no more to say Monsieur
Beauseant informs me that the contract is to be signed this very day

M Deschap It is at one oclock precisely Will you be one of the
witnesses

Damas INo that is to sayyes certainlyat one oclock I will
wait on you

M Deschap Till then adieucome Beauseant

Exeunt BEAUSEANT and DESCHAPELLES

 Damas The man who sets his heart upon a woman
 Is a chameleon and doth feed on air
 From air he takes his colorsholds his life
 Changes with every windgrows lean or fat
 Rosy with hope or green with jealousy
 Or pallid with despairjust as the gale
 Varies from North to Southfrom heat to cold
 Oh woman woman thou shouldst have few sins
 Of thine own to answer for Thou art the author
 Of such a book of follies in a man
 That it would need the tears of all the angels
 To blot the record out

Enter MELNOTTE pale and agitated

I need not tell thee Thou hast heard

Mel The worst I have

Damas Be cheerd others are fair as she is

 Mel Others The world is crumbled at my feet
 She was my world filld up the whole of being
 Smiled in the sunshinewalkd the glorious earth
 Sate in my heartwas the sweet life of life
 The Past was hers I dreamt not of a Future
 That did not wear her shape Memry and Hope
 Alike are gone Pauline is faithless Henceforth
 The universal space is desolate

Damas Hope yet

 Mel Hope yesone hope is left me still
 A soldiers grave Glory has died with love
 I look into my heart and where I saw
 Pauline see Death

 After a pauseBut am I not deceived
 I went but by the rumor of the town
 Rumor is falseI was too hasty Damas
 Whom hast thou seen

Damas Thy rival and her father Arm thyself for the truthHe heeds
not

Mel She

 Will never know how deeply she was loved
 The charitable night that wont to bring
 Comfort today in bright and eloquent dreams
 Is henceforth leagued with misery Sleep farewell
 Or else become eternal Oh the waking
 From false oblivion and to see the sun
 And know she is anothers

Damas Be a man

 Mel I am a manit is the sting of woe
 Like mine that tells us we are men

 Damas The false one
 Did not deserve thee

 Mel HushNo word against her
 Why should she keep through years and silent absence
 The holy tablets of her virgin faith
 True to a traitors name Oh blame her not
 It were a sharper grief to think her worthless
 Than to be what I am Todaytoday
 They said Today This day so wildly welcomed
 This clay my soul had singled out of time
 And markd for bliss This day oh could I see her
 See her once more unknown but hear her voice
 So that one echo of its music might
 Make ruin less appalling in its silence

 Damas Easily done Come with me to her house
 Your dressyour cloakmoustachethe bronzed hues
 Of time and toilthe name you bearbelief
 In your absence all will ward away suspicion
 Keep in the shade Ay I would have you come
 There may be hope Pauline is yet so young
 They may have forced her to these second bridals
 Out of mistaken love

 Mel No bid me hope not
 Bid me not hope I could not bear again
 To fall from such a heaven One gleam of sunshine
 And the ice breaks and I am lost Oh Damas
 Theres no such thing as courage in a man
 The veriest slave that ever crawld from danger
 Might spurn me now When first I lost her Damas
 I bore it did I not I still had hope
 And now II Bursts into an agony of grief

 Damas What comrade all the women
 That ever smiled destruction on brave hearts
 Were not worth tears like these

 Mel Tis pastforget it
 I am prepared life has no further ills
 The cloud has broken in that stormy rain
 And on the waste I stand alone with Heaven

 Damas His very face is changed a breaking heart
 Does its work soonCome Melnotte rouse thyself
 One effort more Again thoult see her

 Mel See her
 There is a passion in that simple sentence
 That shivers all the pride and power of reason
 Into a chaos

Damas Time wanes come ere yet It be too late

Mel Terrible wordsToo late Lead on One last look more and then

Damas Forget her

Mel Forget her yesFor death remembers not Exeunt

SCENE II

A room in the house of MONSIEUR DESCHAPPELLES PAULINE seated in great
dejection

 Pauline It is so then I must be false to Love
 Or sacrifice a father Oh my Claude
 My lover and my husband Have I lived
 To pray that thou mayest find some fairer boon
 Than the deep faith of this devoted heart
 Nourishd till nownow broken

Enter MONSIEUR DESCHAPPELLES

 M Deschap My dear child
 How shall I thankhow bless thee Thou hast saved
 I will not say my fortuneI could bear
 Reverse and shrink notbut that prouder wealth
 Which merchants value mostmy name my credit
 The hardwon honors of a toilsome life
 These thou hast saved my child

 Pauline Is there no hope
 No hope but this

 M Deschap None If without the sum
 Which Beauseant offers for thy hand this day
 Sinks to the westtomorrow brings our ruin
 And hundreds mingled in that ruin curse
 The bankrupt merchant and the insolvent herd
 We feasted and made merry cry in scorn
 How pride has fallenLo the bankrupt merchant
 My daughter thou hast saved us

Pauline And am lost

M Deschap Come let me hope that Beauseants love

 Pauline His love
 Talk not of love Love has no thought of self
 Love buys not with the ruthless usurers gold
 The loathsome prostitution of a hand
 Without a heart Love sacrifices all things
 To bless the thing it loves He knows not love
 Father his love is hatehis hope revenge
 My tears my anguish my remorse for falsehood
 These are the joys that he wrings from our despair

 M Deschap If thou deemst thus reject him Shame and ruin
 Were better than thy miserythink no more ont
 My sand is wellnigh runwhat boots it when
 The glass is broken Well annul the contract
 And if tomorrow in the prisoners cell
 These aged limbs are laid why still my child
 Ill think thou art spared and wait the Liberal Hour
 That lays the beggar by the side of kings

 Pauline Nonoforgive me You my honord father
 You who so loved so cherishd me whose lips
 Never knew one harsh word Im not ungrateful
 I am but humanhush Now call the bridegroom
 You see I am preparedno tearsall calm
 But father talk no more of love

 M Deschap My child
 Tis but one struggle he is young rich noble
 Thy state will rank first mid the dames of Lyons
 And when this heart can shelter thee no more
 Thy youth will not be guardianless

 Pauline I have set
 My foot upon the ploughshareI will pass
 The fiery ordeal Aside Merciful Heaven support me
 And on the absent wanderer shed the light
 Of happier starslost evermore to me

Enter MADAME DESCHAPPELLES BEAUSEANT GLAVIS and Notary

Mme Deschap Why Pauline you are quite in deshabilleyou ought to
be more alive to the importance of this joyful occasion We had once
looked higher it is true but you see after all Monsieur Beauseants
father was a Marquis and thats a great comfort Pedigree and
jointureyou have them both in Monsieur Beauseant A young lady
decorously brought up should only have two considerations in her choice
of a husband first is his birth honorable secondly will his death
be advantageous All other trifling details should be left to parental
anxiety

Beau approaching and waving aside Madame Ah Pauline let me hope
that you are reconciled to an event which confers such rapture upon me

Pauline I am reconciled to my doom

Beau Doom is a harsh word sweet lady

Pauline aside This man must have some mercyhis heart cannot be
marble Aloud Oh sir be justbe generous Seize a noble triumpha
great revenge Save the father and spare the child

Beau aside joyjoy alike to my hatred and my passion The haughty
Pauline is at last my suppliant Aloud You ask from me what I
have not the sublime virtue to granta virtue reserved only for
the gardeners son I cannot forego my hopes in the moment of their
fulfilment I adhere to the contractyour fathers ruin or your hand

Damas Holdyou see my friend Morier Melnotte is his most intimate
friendfought in the same fieldsslept in the same tent Have you any

 The friend ofMelnotte

 Mel Lady yes

 Pauline And you will see him
 And you will bear to himayword for word
 All that this heart which breaks in parting from him
 Would send ere still for ever

 Mel He hath told me
 You have the right to choose from out the world
 A worthier bridegroomhe forgoes all claim
 Even to murmur at his doom Speak on

 Pauline Tell him for years I never nursed a thought
 That was not histhat on his wandering way
 Daily and nightly pourd a mourners prayers
 Tell him evn now that I would rather share
 His lowliest lotwalk by his side an outcast
 Work for him beg with himlive upon the light
 Of one kind smile from himthan wear the crown
 The Bourbon lost

 Mel aside Am I already mad
 And does delirium utter such sweet words
 Into a dreamers ear Aloud You love him thus
 And yet desert him

 Pauline Say that if his eye
 Could read this heartits struggles its temptations
 His love itself would pardon that desertion
 Look on that poor old manhe is my father
 He stands upon the verge of an abyss
 He calls his child to save him Shall I shrink
 From him who gave me birthwithhold my hand
 And see a parent perish Tell him this
 And saythat we shall meet again in Heaven

 Mel LadyIIwhat is this riddlewhat
 The nature of this sacrifice

 Pauline pointing to DAMAS Go ask him

 Beau from the table The papers are preparedwe only need
 Your hand and seal

 Mel Stay ladyone word more
 Were but your duty with your faith united
 Would you still share the lowborn peasants lot

 Pauline Would I Ah better death with him I love
 Than all the pompwhich is but as the flowers
 That crown the victimTurning away I am ready

MELNOTTE rushes to DAMAS

Damas ThereThis is the schedulethis the total

 Beau to DESCHAPPELLES showing notes These
 Are yours the instant she has signd you are
 Still the great House of Lyons

The Notary is about to hand the contract to PAULINE when MELNOTTE
seizes it and tears it

Beau Are you mad

M Deschap How Sir What means this insult

 Mel Peace old man
 I have a prior claim Before the face
 Of man and Heaven I urge it I outbid
 Yon sordid huckster for your priceless jewel Giving a pocketbook
 There is the sum twice told Blush not to take it
 Theres not a coin that is not bought and hallowd
 In the cause of nations with a soldiers blood

Beau Torments and death

Pauline That voice Thou art

Mel Thy husband

PAULINE rushes into his arms

 Look up Look up Paulinefor I can bear
 Thine eyes The stain is blotted from my name
 I have redeemd mine honor I can call
 On France to sanction thy divine forgiveness
 Oh joyOh rapture By the midnight watchfires
 Thus have I seen thee thus foretold this hour
 And midst the roar of battle thus have heard
 The beating of thy heart against my own

 Beau Foold duped and triumphd over in the hour
 Of mine own victory Curses on ye both
 May thorns be planted in the marriagebed
 And love grow sourd and blackend into hate
 Such as the hate that gnaws me

 Damas Curse away
 And let me tell thee Beauseant a wise proverb
 The Arabs haveCurses are like young chickens
 Solemnly And still come home to roost

 Beau Their happiness
 Maddens my soul I am powerless and revengeless To MADAME
 I wish you joy Ha ha the gardeners son Exit

 Damas to GLAVIS Your friend intends to hang himself Methinks
 You ought to be his travelling companion

Gla Sir you are exceedingly obliging Exit

 Pauline Oh
 My father you are savedand by my husband
 Ah blessed hour

Mel Yet you weep still Pauline

Pauline But on thy breastthese tears are sweet and holy

 M Deschap You have won love and honor nobly sir
 Take herbe happy both

 Mme Deschap Im all astonishd
 Who then is Colonel Morier

Damas You behold him

 Mel Morier no more after this happy day
 I would not bear again my fathers name
 Till I could deem it spotless The hours come
 Heaven smiled on conscience As the soldier rose
 From rank to rank how sacred was the fame
 That cancelld crime and raised him nearer thee

 Mme Deschap A Colonel and a hero Well thats something
 Hes wondrously improved I wish you joy sir

 Mel Ah the same love that tempts us into sin
 If it be true love works out its redemption
 And he who seeks repentance for the Past
 Should woo the Angel Virtue in the Future

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
