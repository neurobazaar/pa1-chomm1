INTRODUCTION

The rigid conventionality of the theatre has been frequently remarked
upon Why the world should ever fear a radical indeed is hard to see
since he has against him the whole dead weight of society but least of
all need the radical be dreaded in the theatre When the average person
pays money for his amusements he is little inclined to be pleased with
something which doesnt amuse him and what amuses him nine times out
of ten is what has amused him That is why changes in the theatre are
relatively slow and customs long prevail even till it seems they may
corrupt the theatrical world

For many generations in our playhouse it was the custom to follow the
long play of the evening with an afterpiece generally in one act but
always brief and almost always gay if not farcical Audiences which
in the early days assembled before seven oclock had to be sent home
happy After the tragedy the slapstick or the loud guffaw after
Romeo and Juliet Cibbers Hob in the Well after King Lear The
Irish Widow These two illustrations are taken at random from the
programs of the Charleston theatre in 1773 This custom persisted
until comparatively recent times The fathers and mothers of the present
generation can remember when William Warren at the Boston Museum would
turn of an evening from such a part as his deephearted Sir Peter Teazle
to the loud and empty vociferations of a Morton farce The entertainment
in those days would hardly have been considered complete without the
afterpiece or as time went on sometimes the curtain raiser It is
by no means certain that theatre seats were always cheaper than today
In some cases certainly they were relatively quite as high But it
is certain that you got more for your money You frequently saw your
favorite actor in two contrasted roles two contrasted styles of acting
perhaps and you saw him from early evening till a decently late hour
You didnt get to the theatre at 830 wait for the curtain to rise on a
thinspun drawingroom comedy at 845 and begin hunting for your wraps
at 1035 One hates to think in fact what would have happened to a
manager fifty years ago who didnt give more than that for the price
of a ticket Our fathers and mothers watched their pennies more sharply
than we do

For various reasons one of them no doubt being the growth of cheaper
forms of amusement and the consequent desertion from the traditional
playhouse of a considerable body of those who least like and can least
afford to spend money irrespective of returns the afterpiece and
curtain raiser have practically vanished from our stage They have so
completely vanished in fact that theatre goers have lost not only the
habit of expecting them but the imaginative flexibility to enjoy them
If you should play Romeo and Juliet today and then follow it with
a oneact farce your audience would be uncomfortably bewildered They
would be unable to make the necessary adjustment of mood If you focus
your vision rapidly from a near to a far object you probably suffer
from eyestrain Similarly the jump from one play to the other in the
theatre gives a modern audience mind or moodstrain It is largely
a matter of habit We today have lost the trick through lack of
practice The old custom is dead we are fixed in a new one If Maude
Adams for instance should follow The Little Minister with a roaring
farce or Sothern should turn on the same evening from If I Were King
to Box and Cox we should feel that some artistic unity had been
rudely violated nor am I at all sure being a product of this
generation but that we should be quite right

Matters standing as they do then it seems to me that the talk
we frequently hear about reviving the art of the oneact play by
restoring the curtain raisers or afterpieces to the programs of our
theatres is reactionary and futile All recent attempts to pad out
a slim play with an additional short one have failed to meet with
approval even when the short piece was so masterly a work as Barries
The Will splendidly acted by John Drew or the same authors Twelve
Pound Look acted by Miss Barrymore Nor is it at all certain that the
oneact plays of our parents and grandparents and greatgrandparents
the names of which you may read by the thousands on ancient playbills
added anything to the store of dramatic literature Some of them are
decently entombed in the catacombs of Lacys British Drama or still
available for amateurs in Frenchs library Did you ever try to read
one Of course there was Box and Cox but it is doubtful if there
will be any great celebration at the tercentenary of Mortons death
For the most part those ancient afterpieces were frankly padding
conventional farces to fill up the bill and send the audiences home
happy To the real art of the drama or the development of the oneact
play as a form of serious literary expression they made precious little
contribution They were a theatrical tradition a convention

But the oneact play nonetheless has an obvious right to existence as
much as the short story and there are plentiful proofs that it can be
as terse vivid and significant Most novelists dont tack on a short
story at the end of their books for full measure but issue their contes
either in collections or in the pages of the magazines What similar
chances are there or can there be for the oneact play the dramatic
short story

An obvious chance is offered by vaudeville The vaudeville audience
is in the mood for rapid alterations of attention it has the habit of
variety This is just as much a convention of vaudeville as the single
play is now a convention of the traditional theatre Indeed anything
longer than a oneact play in vaudeville would be frowned upon Any
one wishing to push the analogy can find more than one correspondence
between a vaudeville program and the contents of a popular magazine
each certainly is the present refuge of short fiction Yet vaudeville
can hardly be considered an ideal cradle for a serious dramatic art
Shall we say that the analogy to the popular magazine still holds
The average playletatrocious wordin the variety theatres is
a dreadful thing crude obvious often sensational or sentimental
usually very badly acted at least in the minor recircles and still
more a frank padding a thing of the footlights than the afterpiece
of our parents It has been frequently said by those optimists who are
forever discovering the birth of the arts in popular amusements that
vaudeville audiences will appreciate and applaud the best This is
only in part true They will appreciate the best juggler the cleverest
trained dog the most appealing ballad singer such as Chevalier or Harry
Lauder But they will no more appreciate those subtleties of dramatic
art which must have free play in the serious development of the oneact
play than the readers of a popular magazine in America or England
either would appreciate Kiplings They or George Moores The Wild
Goose or de Maupassants La Ficelle To expect them to is silly
and to expect that because the supreme vivid example of any form is
comprehensible to all classes and all mixtures of classes therefore the
supreme example is going to be developed out of the commonplace stuff
such mixed audiences daily enjoy is equally to misunderstand the
evolution of an art product in our complex modern world But indeed
the matter scarce calls for argument Vaudeville itself furnishes
the answer Where are its oneact plays which can be called dramatic
literature It is a hopeful sign perhaps that certain of the plays
in this volume have percolated into the varieties But they were not
cradled there

If the traditional theatre then is now in a rut which affords no room
for the oneact play and if vaudeville is an empty cradle for this
branch of dramatic art where shall we turn The oneact play today has
found refuge and encouragement in the experimental theatres and among
the amateurs The best oneact plays so far written in English have come
out of Ireland chiefly from the Abbey Theatre in Dublin where they were
first acted by a company recruited from amateur players Synges Riders
to the Sea Yeatss The Hour Glass the comedies of Lady Gregory and
others of that school have not only proved the power of this form
to carry the sense of reality but its power as well to reach tragic
intensity or high poetic beauty The sombre loveliness and cleansing
reality of Synges masterpiece are almost unrivaled in our shortplay
literature Not from the Abbey Theatre but from the pen of an Irishman
Lord Dunsany have come such short fantasies as The Gods of the
Mountain and The Glittering Gate which the socalled commercial
theatre has quite ignored but which have been played extensively by
amateurs and experimental theatres throughout America and the latter
piece especially has probably been provocative of more experimental
stagecraft and a greater stimulation of poetic fancy among amateur
producers than any drama short or long written in recent years

When the Washington Square Players for the most part amateurs of the
theatre began their experiment in the spring of 1915 they began with
a bill of oneact plays With but two exceptions all their succeeding
productions have been composed of oneact plays usually in groups of
four the last one for the evening sometimes being a pantomime It
should be noted that a program of four oneact plays has the unity of
a collection A short play following a long one is overbalanced and the
program seems to most of us awry The reason for this choice was not
entirely a devotion to the art of the oneact play When players are
inexperienced it is far easier to present a group of plays of one act
than it is to sustain a single set of characters for an entire evening
The action moves more rapidly the tale is told before the monotony of
the actors becomes too apparent Moreover the difference between the
plays helps to furnish that variety which the players themselves cannot
supply by their impersonations Still again it was no doubt easier for
the Washington Square Players to find novelties within their capacity
in the oneact form than in the longer medium At any rate they did
produce oneact plays and are still producing them

Four of these plays are presented in this book four which won approval
first on the stage of the Bandbox Theatre and later acted by other
players in various other theatres One of them Overtones is a
theatrical novelty which if prolonged beyond the oneact form would
become monotonous Another Helenas Husband is a bantering satire
an intellectual skit which would equally suffer by prolongation
Eugenically Speaking could certainly bear no further extension unless
its mood were deepened into seriousness Finally The Clod approaches
the true episodic roundness of the oneact drama or the short story
in its best estate Here is a single episode of reality taken from its
context and set apart for contemplation It begins at the proper moment
for understanding it ends when the tale is told There is here
more than a hint of the art of Guy de Maupassant And the episode is
theatrically excitinga prime requisite for practical performance and
spiritually significanta prime requisite for the serious consideration
of intelligent spectators In these four plays then written for the
Washington Square Players the oneact form demonstrates its right
to our attention and cultivation for it takes interesting ideas or
situations which are incapable of expansion into longer dramas and makes
intelligent entertainment of what otherwise would be lost

Because such organizations as the Abbey Theatre have demonstrated the
value of the oneact play in portraying local life in stimulating a
local stage literature because such organizations in America as the
Washington Square Players have demonstrated the superior value of the
oneact play as a weapon with which to win recognition and build up the
histrionic capacity to tackle longer works and finally because the
oneact play offers such obvious advantages to amateurs it seems fairly
certain that in the immediate future at least the oneact play in
America as a serious art form will be cultivated by the experimental
theatres the socalled Little Theatres and by the more ambitious and
talented amateurs As our experimental theatres increase in numberand
they are increasingit will probably play its part and perhaps no
insignificant a part in the development of a national drama through
the development of a local drama and the cultivation of a taste
for selfexpression in various communities It is only when these
experimental theatres are sufficient in number and the amateur
spirit has been sufficiently aroused in various communities that the
commercial theatre of tradition will be seriously influenced When that
time comesif it does comeone of the results will undoubtedly be a
more flexible theatre the growth of repertoire companies the expansion
of the activities of popular players In a more flexible theatre where
repertoire is a rule rather than a strange and dreaded experiment and
where actors pride themselves on versatility and the public honors them
for it the oneact play will again have its place but not then as a
curtain raiser or afterpiece to pad out an evening or send the suburbs
home happy but as a serious branch of dramatic art In that happy
day Barrie will not be the only firstclass talent in the commercial
playhouse daring the oneact form or at least able to induce a
commercial manager to produce his work in that form

But that time is not yet The oneact play in our country today is an
ally of the amateurs and the innovators For that very reason
perhaps it is the form which will bear the most watching for signs of
imagination and for flashes of insight and interpretative significance

PREFACE TO THE PLAYS

If fools did not rush in where theatrical angels fear to tread this
Preface would never have been written Two years back the Washington
Square Players were called by many who had theatrical experience
fools Now some term us pioneers The future may write us fools again
or something betterthe conclusion being that the difference between
the fool and the pioneer lies in the outcome the secret that the
motive power behind both is enthusiasm

Without enthusiasm the Washington Square Players could never have come
into existence nor survived From the first when we had barely enough
money for rent and none for the costumes and properties we borrowed and
disguised ours was an enthusiasm strong in quantity as well as quality
The theatre is a peculiar art Both in production and reception it
requires numbers and an enduring faith Many a similar attempt has
failed because its experimentation and expression have been restricted
by a single point of view Many have not continued because the desire
has waned in the face of the hardships and sacrifices entailed But the
Players rightly had a plural name We were and are a collection of
many individualsactors authors artists and artloversall fired
with the sincere desire to give to playgoers something they had not been
able previously to find on the American stage And our desire has been
strong enough to face and fight and to continue to face and fight
the evergrowing everchanging problems of finance art and human
interrelations which are the inescapable factors of the theatre

We believed in the democracy of the drama But we understand democracy
to mean not the gratification of the taste of the many to the exclusion
of that of the few but the satisfaction of all tastes We had no
quarrel with the stage as it was save that there wasnt enough of it
We felt there was a public that wanted something other than it could
getas evidenced by the rise of such institutions as the Drama
Leagueand that that public was large enough to support what it wanted
once it learned where to find it The problem was to bridge the gap of
waiting And it was met by the sacrifices of all those who worked at
first for nothing and then for little more so that the Players would
not fall into debt in the process of reaching an audience As an able
New York dramatic critic stated the establishment of the Washington
Square Players was merely one more proof that in America as elsewhere
joy was a greater incentive to work than money

This enthusiasm among the workers both in quality and quantity was
generously shared by the spectators The public which looked for plays
acting and producing different from what it could find on the regular
stage proved us right in believing that it was sufficiently large and
interested to warrant our experiment Critics and patrons gave us from
the first and we hope will continue to give us that personal interest
and sympathetic appreciation which have been among the most vital
factors contributing to our growth

So far we have produced thirtytwo plays of oneact and greater length
and of these twenty have been American The emphasis of our interest has
been placed on the American playwright because we feel that no American
theatre can be really successful unless it develops a native drama to
present and interpret those emotions ideas characters and conditions
with which we as Americans are primarily concerned

Of these twenty American plays the Drama League has selected four for
this volume of its series Excluding comment on my farcefor an author
is notoriously unfit to judge his own workI think it may be said that
these represent a fair example of the success the Players have met with
in trying to encourage the writing of American plays with freshness and
sincerity of theme and development skilful delineation of character
nondidactic presentation of an idea and dramatic and esthetic
effectiveness without theatricalism They are the early products of a
new movement in the American theatre of which we are happy to be a
part and if their publication meets with the sympathetic appreciative
reception that has been accorded their production we feel and hope that
not only these authors not only the Washington Square Players but all
of the workers in this new movement will be encouraged and stimulated to
a further effort a greater mastery and a bigger achievement

The back wall is broken at stage left by the projection at right angles
of a partially enclosed staircase four steps of which leading to the
landing are visible to the audience Underneath the enclosed stairway
is a cubbyhole with a door in front of the door stands a small table
To the left of this table is a kitchen chair A door leading to the yard
is in the centre of the unbroken wall back to the right of the door
a cupboard to the left a stove In the wall right are two windows
Between them is a bench on which there are a pail and a dipper
above the bench a towel hanging on a nail and above the towel a
doublebarrelled shotgun suspended on two pegs

In the wall left and well down stage is a closed door leading to
another room In the centre of the kitchen stands a large table to the
right and left of this two straightbacked chairs

The walls are roughly plastered The stage is lighted by the moon which
shines into the room through the windows and a candle on table centre
When the door back is opened a glimpse of a desolate farmyard is seen
in the moonlight

When the curtain rises THADDEUS TRASK a man of fifty or sixty years
of age short and thick set slow in speech and movement yet in perfect
health sits lazily smoking his pipe in a chair at the right of the
centre table

After a moment MARY TRASK a tired emaciated woman whose years equal
her husbands enters from the yard carrying a pail of water and a
lantern She puts the pail on the bench and hangs the lantern above it
then crosses to the stove

MARY fills the kettle with water and puts it on the stove closes
the door back takes the lantern from the wall tries twice before she
succeeds in blowing it out Puts the lantern on the table before the
cubbyhole Drags herself up the stairs pausing a moment on the top
step for breath before she disappears from sight There is a silence
Then the door back is opened a trifle and a mans hand is seen
Cautiously the door is opened wide and a young NORTHERN SOLDIER is
silhouetted on the threshold He wears a dirty uniform and has a bloody
bandage tied about his head He is wounded sick and exhausted He
stands at the door a moment listening intently then hastily crosses
to the centre table looking for food He bumps against the chair and
mutters an oath Finding nothing on the table he moves toward the
cupboard Suddenly the galloping of horses is heard in the distance The
NORTHERNER starts then rushes to the window nearer the audience For a
moment the sound ceases then it begins again growing gradually louder
and louder The NORTHERNER hurries through the door left Horses and
voices are heard in the yard and almost immediately heavy thundering
knocks sound on the door back A racket is heard above stairs The
knockers on the door grow impatient and push the door open A large
powerful SOUTHERN SERGEANT and a smaller more youthful TROOPER of
the same army enter At the same time THADDEUS appears on the stairs
carrying a candle

SERGEANT to THADDEUS not unkindly Sorry my friend but you were so
darn slow bout openin the door that we had to walk in Has there been
a Northern soldier round here today

THADDEUS timidly I aint seed one

MARY comes downstairs slowly She is all atremble

THADDEUS Say Mary you was h

SERGEANT Well search the place

SERGEANT sharply Whats that woman

MARY There aint no one here an yere keepin us from our sleep

SERGEANT Your sleep This is an affair of life and death Get us a
lantern

THADDEUS moves to the table which stands in front of the cubbyhole
and lights the lantern from the candle which he holds in his hand He
hands the lantern to the SERGEANT

SERGEANT seeing the door to the cubbyhole Ha Tryin to hide the
door are you by puttin a table in front of it You cant fool me To
THADDEUS Pull the table away and lets see whats behind the door

THADDEUS Its a cubbyhole an aint been opened in years

SERGEANT sternly and emphatically I said to open the door

THADDEUS sets the candle on the larger table moves the smaller table
to the right and opens the door to the cubbyhole Anger is seen on
MARYS face The SERGEANT takes a longbarrelled revolver from his belt
and peers into the cubbyhole He sees nothing

SERGEANT returning his revolver to his belt Were goin to tear this
place to pieces till we find him You might just as well hand him over
now

MARY There aint no one here

SERGEANT All right Now well see Dick you stand guard at the door

DICK goes to the door back and stands gazing out into the nighthis
back to the audience

SERGEANT to THADDEUS Come along man Ill have a look at the
upstairs To MARY You sit down in that chair points to the chair at
right of table and feeling for a sufficiently strong threat Dont you
stir or IllIll set fire to your house To THADDEUS Go on ahead

THADDEUS and the SERGEANT go upstairs MARY sinks almost lifelessly
into the chair She is the picture of fear She sits facing left
Suddenly she leans forward The door left is being opened She opens her
eyes wide and draws her breath sharply She opens her mouth as though
she would scream but makes no sound The NORTHERNER comes slowly and
cautiously through the door DICK cannot see him because of the jog in
the wall MARY only stares in bewilderment at the NORTHERNER as
the man with eyes fixed appealingly on her opens the door to the
cubbyhole and crawls inside

DICK Woman

MARY almost with a crythinking that DICK has seen the NORTHERNER
Yes

DICK Have you got an apple handy Im starved MARY moves to the
cupboard to get the apple for DICK The SERGEANT and THADDEUS come
downstairs The SERGEANT seeing that MARY is not where he left her
looks about quickly and discovers her at the cupboard

SERGEANT Here whatd I tell you Id do if you moved from that chair

MARY with great fear Oh I didntI onlyhe wanted

DICK Its all right Sergeant I asked her to get me an apple

SERGEANT Dick take this lantern and search the barn DICK takes the
lantern from the SERGEANT and goes out back To THADDEUS Come in
here with me Takes the candle from centre table The SERGEANT and
THADDEUS move toward the door left As though in a stupor MARY starts
to follow Sit down MARY falls into the chair at the right of the
centre table The SERGEANT and THADDEUS go into the room at left They
can be heard moving furniture about MARYS eyes fall on a pin on the
floor She bends over picks it up and fastens it in her belt The
SERGEANT and THADDEUS return

SERGEANT If I find him now after all the trouble youve given me
you know whatll happen Theres likely to be two dead men and a woman
instead of only the Yankee

DICK bounding into the room Sergeant

SERGEANT What is it DICK hurries to the SERGEANT and says something
in a low voice to him Satisfaction shows on the latters face

SERGEANT Now my good people how did that horse get here

THADDEUS What horse


DICK Theres a horse in the barn with a saddle on his back I swear
hes been ridden lately

THADDEUS amazed There is

SERGEANT You know it To MARY Come woman who drove that horse
here

MARY silent for a momenther eyes on the floor I dont know I
didnt hear nothin

THADDEUS moving in the direction of the door back Let me go an see

SERGEANT pushing THADDEUS back No you dont You two have done
enough to justify the harshest measures Show us the mans hidingplace

THADDEUS If theres anybody here hes come in the night without our
knowin it I tell ye I didnt see anybody an she didnt an

SERGEANT has been watching MARY Where is he The SERGEANTS tone
makes THADDEUS jump There is a pause during which MARY seems trying
to compose herself Then slowly she lifts her eyes and looks at the
SERGEANT

MARY There aint nobody in the house cept us two

SERGEANT to DICK Did you search all the outbuildings

DICK Yes Theres not a trace of him except the horse

SERGEANT wiping the perspiration from his face speaks with apparent
deliberation at first but increases to great strength and emphasis He
didnt have much of a start of us and I think he was wounded A farmer
down the road said he heard hoofbeats The man the other side of you
heard nothing and the horse is in your barn Slowly draws revolver
and points it at THADDEUS There are ways of making people confess

THADDEUS covering his face with his hands For Gods sake dont I
know that horse looks badbut as I live I aint heard a sound or seen
anybody Id give the man up in a minute if he was here

SERGEANT lowering his gun Yes I guess you would You wouldnt want
me to hand you and your wife over to our army to be shot down like dogs
MARY shivers Swings round sharply and points the gun at MARY Your
wife knows where hes hid

MARY breaking out in irritating rasping voice Im sure I wish I did
An Id tell ye quick an git ye out of here Taint no fun fer me to
have ye prowlin all over my house Ye aint got no right t torment me
like this Lord knows how Ill git my days work done if I cant have
my sleep

SERGEANT has been gazing at her in astonishment lowers his gun Good
God what a clod Nothing but her own petty existence In different
voice to MARY Ill have to ask you to get us something to eat Were
famished With relief but showing some anger MARY turns to the stove
She lights the fire and puts more coffee in the pot

SERGEANT Come Dick we better give our poor horses some water Theyre
all tired out In lower voice The man isnt here If he were he
couldnt get away while were in the yard To THADDEUS Get us a pail
to give the horses some water Sees the pails on the bench Picks one
of them up and moves toward the door

the empty chamber

MARY alarmed What ye goin t do with that gun

NORTHERNER Dont be afraid Its not load

Go call them in Save your poor skin and your husbands if you can Call

MARY stands beside the table trembling terribly The SERGEANT DICK
and THADDEUS come running in

SERGEANT What did you yell for No answer Seizing her by the arm
Answer

MARY I knocked the dipper off the table It scared me

SERGEANT dropping wearily into chair at left of centre table Well

MARY stands gazing at him It aint finished

OFFICER worn out by his days work and MARYS stupidity from now on
absolutely brutish Youve had time to cook a dozen meals Youre as
slow as a snail What did you do all the time we were in the barn

MARY I didnt do nothin

SERGEANT You lazy female Now get a move on and give us something fit
to eat Dont try to get rid of any leftovers on us If you do youll
suffer for it

MARY stands looking at him Dont you know anything you brainless
farmdrudge Hurry I said

MARY turns to the stove THADDEUS sits in chair at left of smaller
table

DICK What a night My stomachs as hollow as these peoples heads
Takes towel which hangs above the bench and wipes the barrel of his gun
with it

MARY sees DICK Thats one of my best towels

DICK Cant help it

SERGEANT Tend to the breakfast Thats enough for you to do at one
time

DICK puts his gun on the smaller table and sits at right of centre
table

SERGEANT quietly to DICK I dont see how he gave us the slip

DICK He knew we were after him and drove his horse in here and went
on afoot Clever scheme I must admit

THADDEUS endeavoring to get them into conversation Have ye rid far

DICK shortly Far enough

THADDEUS Twenty miles or so

DICK Perhaps

THADDEUS How long ye been chasin the critter

SERGEANT Shut up man Dont you see we dont want to talk to you Take
hold and hurry woman My patiences at an end

MARY puts a loaf of bread some fried eggs and a coffee pot on the
table

MARY There I hope yere satisfied

The SERGEANT and DICK pull their chairs to the table and begin to
eat

SERGEANT Is this all we get Come it wont do you any good to be
stingy Obviously from now on everything the SERGEANT says drives
MARY nearer madness

MARY Its all I got

SERGEANT It isnt a mouthful for a chickadee Give us some butter

MARY There aint none

SERGEANT No butter on a farm God the way you lie

MARY I

SERGEANT Shut up

DICK Have you got any cider

SERGEANT Dont ask She and the man probably drank themselves stupid on
it Throws fork on floor I never struck such a place in my life Get
me another fork How do you expect me to eat with that bent thing

MARY stoops with difficulty and picks up the fork Gets another from
the cupboard and gives it to the SERGEANT

SERGEANT Now give us some salt Dont you know that folks eat it on
eggs

MARY crosses to the cupboard mistakes the pepper for the salt and
puts it on the table

SERGEANT sprinkles pepper on his food I said salt woman Spelling
SALT Salt Salt

MARY goes to the cupboard returns to the table with the salt Almost
ready to drop she drags herself to the window nearer back and leans
against it watching the SOUTHERNERS like a hunted animal THADDEUS sits
nodding in the corner The SERGEANT and DICK go on devouring the food
The SERGEANT pours the coffee Puts his cup to his lips takes one
swallow then jumping to his feet and upsetting his chair as he does
so he hurls his cup to the floor The crash of china stirs THADDEUS
MARY shakes in terror

SERGEANT bellowing and pointing to the fluid trickling on the floor
Have you tried to poison us you God damn hag

MARY screams and the faces of the men turn white It is like the cry
of the animal goaded beyond endurance

MARY screeching Call my coffee poison will ye Call me a hag Ill
learn ye Im a woman and yere drivin me crazy Snatches the
gun from the wall points it at the SERGEANT and fires Keeps on
screeching The SERGEANT falls to the floor DICK rushes for his gun

THADDEUS Mary Mary

MARY aiming at DICK and firing I aint a hag Im a woman but yere
killin me

DICK falls just as he reaches his gun THADDEUS is in the corner with
his hands over his ears The NORTHERNER stands on the stairs MARY
continues to pull the trigger of the empty gun The NORTHERNER is
motionless for a moment then he goes to THADDEUS and shakes him

NORTHERNER Go get my horse quick

THADDEUS obeys The NORTHERNER turns to MARY She gazes at him but
does not understand a word he says

NORTHERNER with great fervor Im ashamed of what I said The whole
country will hear of this and you Takes her hand and presses it to
his lips then turns and hurries out of the house MARY still holds the
gun in her hand She pushes a strand of gray hair back from her face
and begins to pick up the fragments of the broken coffee cup

MARY in dead flat tone Ill have to drink out the tin cup now

The hoofbeats of the NORTHERNERS horse are heard

CHARACTERS

 UNA A girl
 GEORGE COXEY A conductor
 MR BRAITHEWAITE A financier
 JARVIS A butler


TIME Between today and tomorrow

SCENE A room in the Braithewaite mansion richly but tastefully
furnished Among these furnishings it is necessary for the play to note
besides the door at the back only the table that stands a little to the
right of the centre of the room with a statue on it and three chairs
which stand one to the right one to the left and one in the middle
It is a winter afternoon and the room is illuminated by invisible
lights

Enter UNA followed by GEORGE COXEY UNA is a charming fashionable
girl of twenty with a suave blend of will and poise GEORGE COXEY is a
handsome wellbuilt magneticlooking youth of about twentyfive He is
dressed in the garb of a streetcar conductor and carries the cap in his
hand Although somewhat inconvenienced and preoccupied with the novelty
of his surroundings and his situation he remains in the main in
excellent selfpossession an occasional twinkle in his eye showing that
he is even quietly alive to a certain humor in the adventure Above all
his attitude is that rare one which we like to feel typical of American
youth of facing an unusual situation firmly and seeing and grasping
its possibilities quickly

He stands near the door waiting examining the room and warming his
hands while UNA goes to the bell and rings it and then proceeds to the
mirror to primp a little When she is finished she turns and notices
him

UNA Why my dear man sit down She points to a chair at the right

GEORGE Thanks after you

UNA laughs Oh Excuse me I forgot Youre a car conductor Naturally
youre polite

GEORGE Not naturally Miss But Ive learned

UNA An apt pupil too Let me teach you then that the ruder you are to
a woman the more shell hate youor love you She goes up to him and
invites him with a gesture Sit down

GEORGE remains immobile The polite are not only bourgeois theyre
boring

GEORGE When I know Im right I stick to it

UNA But you must grow tired of standing

GEORGE If I did Id lose my job

UNA You have already Sit down

GEORGE firmly After you

UNA taking the chair centre and sitting on it Youre splendid Now

GEORGE sits in the offered chair a little stiffly

UNA Isnt that better than ringing up fares

GEORGE smiling at his attempt at a pun Fairly

UNA rising perturbed No You mustnt do that Thats vulgar

GEORGE rising in alarm What have I done

UNA vexed again Sit down You mustnt jump up when I do He remains
standing Vexed but smiling she sits Well there He sits down You
punned You mustnt We all like puns but its good form to call them
bad taste

Enter JARVIS the Butler

JARVIS starts slightly at perceiving the situation but controls
himself Did you ring for me Miss

UNA Yes Please tell my father that Id like to see him at once

JARVIS goes out

UNA Do you know the reason that you are here

GEORGE The hundred dollars you gave me

UNA No

GEORGE Yes I wouldnt have left my job if you hadnt given me that

UNA I suppose not But I mean do you know why I brought you here

GEORGE Im waiting to see

UNA enthusiastically I wonder if youll like it

GEORGE Your father

UNA No Dads a dear That is he is when he sees you mean business

Enter MR BRAITHEWAITE He is a wellpreserved man near sixty almost
always completely master of himself On seeing COXEY he too gives a
little start and then controls himself

BRAITHEWAITE Una dear

UNA jumping up in excitement Oh Daddy Im so glad you were in To
GEORGE who has risen too Keep your seat Draw up a chair DadIve
done it

BRAITHEWAITE Done what

UNA bringing up a chair and placing it to her right Do sit down Dad
Hes so delicious He wont sit down till we doand you know how much
they have to stand

BRAITHEWAITE looks at GEORGE and UNA and then sits in the chair
allotted to him whereupon UNA sits in hers and then GEORGE sits down
Now dear what is it you have done

UNA Selected a husband

GEORGE moves a little uneasily BRAITHEWAITE looks at GEORGE and then
speaks to UNA

BRAITHEWAITE You mean

UNA pointing to GEORGE Him GEORGE rises in discomfiture Do sit
down Were all sitting now you see GEORGE brings himself to sit down
again

BRAITHEWAITE But my dear

UNA Now dont say a word until you hear the whole story You read that
article by Shaw in the Metropolitan didnt you I did You remember
what he wrote The best eugenic guide is the sex attractionthe Voice
of Nature He thinks the trouble is at present that we dare not marry
out of our own sphere But Ill show you exactly what he says She
fusses in her handbag and pulls out a sheet of a magazine which she
unfolds as she says I always carry the article with me Its so
stimulating

BRAITHEWAITE protesting Youre not going to read me a whole Shaw
article are you Its five oclock now and weve a dinner date at
eight dear

UNA Its a Shaw article not a Shaw preface However Ill only read
the passage Ive marked Listen She reads I do not believe you will
ever have any improvement in the human race until you greatly widen
the area of possible sexual selection until you make it as wide as
the numbers of the community make it Just consider what occurs at the
present time I walk down Oxford Street let me say as a young man He
might just as well have said young woman you know

BRAITHEWAITE And

UNA continues reading I see a woman who takes my fancy With me it
would be a man of course

BRAITHEWAITE For your purpose of course

UNA continuing again I fall in love with her It would seem very
sensible in an intelligent community that I should take off my hat and
say to this lady Will you excuse me but you attract me strongly
and if you are not already engaged would you mind taking my name
and address and considering whether you would care to marry me
BRAITHEWAITE looks uncomfortably at GEORGE who looks uncomfortable
though amused himself Now I have no such chance at present

BRAITHEWAITE Exactly You see he admits it

UNA Yes but why shouldnt I have the chance That set me thinking I
decided he was right I am intelligent am I not

BRAITHEWAITE I refuse to commit myself dear until I hear all your
story

UNA Well I decided Id make the chance You see IIve been led to
think recently that I ought to be getting married

BRAITHEWAITE May I ask why

UNA Yes dear but Id rather not answer

BRAITHEWAITE I beg pardon

UNA And when I looked about me for the possibilities in my own set
Ishe makes a facewell I wasnt attracted

BRAITHEWAITE I admit in society as a rule the women grow stronger
and the men weaker

UNA Exactly And I knew you wanted to be a proud grandfather

BRAITHEWAITE Youre mistaken dear I hadnt given the subject any
thought so I had no desires

UNA Well I have BRAITHEWAITE slightly shows that he is perhaps
shocked UNA notices this and continues in explanation given the
subject a good deal of thought Ive spent days buying secondhand
clothing to give away at the missions and lodging houses in order to
have a look

BRAITHEWAITE At least there was charity in that

UNA Yes You see I didnt want charity to have to begin at my home
Selfpreservation is the first law of Nature

BRAITHEWAITE And selfpropagation I suppose the second

UNA Wellthe missions were no good They were all so starved and
pinchedlooking there I couldnt tell what theyd be like if they got
proper nourishment And I didnt want to take a chance So I went to
some coal yards

BRAITHEWAITE To find the devil not so black as painted

UNA with a grimace Blacker I couldnt see what they looked like Of
course if I could have asked them to wash their faces

BRAITHEWAITE looking at GEORGE Considering what you have done I
dont see

UNA I did ask one but he made some vulgar remark about black dirt and
red paint So I left him

BRAITHEWAITE And then

UNA I spent all today riding up and down town in street cars Its
very fascinating Dad All you can see for a nickel I never realized
what a public benefactor you were

BRAITHEWAITE modestly Oh I am amply repaid

UNA in explanation to GEORGE Dads the president of your traction
company you know GEORGE rises in fright Oh thats all right Ive
lost you your job but Ill get you a better one as I promised Dont be
afraid of Dadin the parlor Sit down

BRAITHEWAITE to GEORGE You might as well make yourself physically
comfortable you know Theres no telling how my daughter may make us
feel in other ways

GEORGE sits down again regaining his composure a little

BRAITHEWAITE to UNA And so today you investigated travelling in
street cars

UNA Yes Joyriding you know Then I saw himand decided I knew he
wouldnt dare to propose to meunder existing conditions

BRAITHEWAITE So you asked him to marry you

UNA Certainly not Ive too much consideration for you dear

BRAITHEWAITE But I thought you said

UNA I decided to bring him home to get your consent first
BRAITHEWAITE starts to say something I knew youd approve when you
saw him But I wanted to be sure I hadnt overlooked anything And if
I had I didnt want to have raised his hopes for nothing To GEORGE
Would you mind standing a moment now until Dad looks you over

GEORGE fidgets a little in embarrassment

BRAITHEWAITE My dear do you think the gentleman

UNA Gentleman Oh yes I forgot I neednt have been so clumsy
She rises GEORGE rises automatically She continues to GEORGE I
apologize

BRAITHEWAITE also rising and moving his chair aside I fear you have
been too rude

UNA So do I Ive never even introduced you Father this isthis
is To GEORGE By the wayI forgot to askwhat is your name

GEORGE Coxey Miss

UNA sounding it Coxey Whats the first name I cant call my husband
Coxey you know

GEORGE George Miss

UNA triumphantly George Theres a fine virile name for you George
Coxey How strong that sounds One of those names that would go equally
well in the blue book or the police blotter

GEORGE I never

UNA Dont disclaim I know youve never been arrested One can see your
goodness in your face

BRAITHEWAITE reprovingly Many of the best people go to jail now
dear

UNA I know But hes not rich and thank heaven hes not a fanatic
Isnt he goodlooking And Im sure hes strong See those hands of
hisa little rough of course but I like that and so firm and for
his job wonderfully clean Dont hide them George They attracted me
from the start

BRAITHEWAITE How did you come here with my daughter at all sir

UNA quickly I got off with him at the car barn when he finished his
run and asked him

BRAITHEWAITE Didnt you know you would lose your job by leaving that
way

GEORGE with a suppressed smile Yes sir

BRAITHEWAITE And you came at any rate

GEORGE You see sir she gave me

UNA interrupting hurriedly A beseeching look Just one I didnt use
more than was necessary Pointedly to GEORGE You see George I have
learnt economy from father He hates me to be extravagant

BRAITHEWAITE That my dear is the chief objection I have to this
episodeits extravagance

UNA Please dont call it an episode father

BRAITHEWAITE You must admit itsrather unusual

UNA In England lords always marry chorus girls

BRAITHEWAITE But he is a conductor

GEORGE angry Yes And conductors are

UNA As hard working as chorus girlsonly Dont be snobbish George
Of course a conductor is more unusual I admit I cant help that
though To her father You shouldnt have called me Una if you
didnt want me to be unique

BRAITHEWAITE reminiscently That was most unfortunatemost It was
your mothers idea She believed in symbolsand in a small family

UNA Oh Was that why Well no matter Ive always thought it meant
individuality and Ive done my best to live up to it She looks at the
statue That statue ought to be on the other side of the room

BRAITHEWAITE Ill have some of the men move it tomorrow

UNA Id like to see the effect now

BRAITHEWAITE slightly annoyed at this seeming irrelevance I wish I
could teach you concentration Im not strong enough to move it myself
dear and

GEORGE Can I

BRAITHEWAITE Why

UNA Oh If you would

GEORGE goes over to it and then hesitates what to do with his cap which
he has in his hand

UNA Ill take that

GEORGE giving it to her Thanks He bends and lifts the statue
without effort while UNA watches him admiringly fingering his cap
When he reaches the other side of the room he stops waveringly
awaiting instructions

UNA talking as GEORGE waits Look at him Hes as fine as the statue
isnt he And you know what you think of that See the strength he has

BRAITHEWAITE Well

UNA to GEORGE Thank you so much You may put it back again That was
all I wanted After GEORGE has I hope I didnt overtax you

GEORGE Oh it aint very heavy

UNA triumphantly to her father You see

BRAITHEWAITE But he uses aint

UNA imitating the reproof of her father Many of the best people use
aint now dear

BRAITHEWAITE Not with his enunciation

UNA What was yours like when you were a railroad signalman

BRAITHEWAITE Una The past of a public man should be private

UNA George has our childrens future before him All the others I know
have only their parents past behind You could give him a job suitable
for my husband Ill make my husband suitable for the job

BRAITHEWAITE But you dont know him my dear

UNA I dont know myself for that matter If I dont like him its easy
enough to go to Reno

BRAITHEWAITE Then you insist

UNA Im tremendously eager Its so unusual

BRAITHEWAITE I suppose I could sue Shaw

UNA Dont be silly Sue an Englishman with German sympathies Wheres
your neutrality

BRAITHEWAITE sinking into a chair Very well

UNA running up to GEORGE with delight Then its settled dear Were
going to marry

GEORGE Excuse me Miss we aint

BRAITHEWAITE shocked Aint again

UNA troubled Oh please

BRAITHEWAITE You see what plunging means I told you I believed in

UNA walking up and down thinking Sh Be quiet father Dont lose
your head

BRAITHEWAITE Better than losing your heart

UNA laughing I have it Of course How stupid of me not to think
George

GEORGE Yes Miss

BRAITHEWAITE Wouldnt you better call him Mr Coxey now

UNA paying no heed to her fathers remark George you must divorce
your wife

GEORGE Me Why shes as good as gold and

UNA Thats unfortunate Thinking Then Ill have to run away with you
and let her get the divorce

BRAITHEWAITE now really shocked Una

UNA innocently What Dad Have you something better to suggest

BRAITHEWAITE fuming I cant permit it I didnt mind the uncommon
scandal of your marrying a car conductor but I absolutely draw the line
at common scandal

UNA a little bored Father dear why will you sometimes talk to me
as though I were the Public Service Commission Theres going to be no
scandal You can keep it out of the newspapers

GEORGE Excuse me but that dont make any difference I dont want to
get a divorce

UNA You dont Why

GEORGE embarrassed Sounds like a song I know butI love my wife

UNA in despair And youre the unusual man Im to marry

BRAITHEWAITE with the contempt of a professional toward an amateur
Stealing nickels doesnt develop the imagination

UNA desperately How can you love your wife Some simple economizing
prosaic hausfrau who

GEORGE with spirit I dont know what youre saying but you better be
careful not to insult my wife Shes as good as you are and a rectors
daughter

UNA dumbfounded What

GEORGE Yes Daughter of one of the biggest skypilots in town I met
her at a settlement house She put the question to me too

UNA angry and doubting She

GEORGE Sure Ive been through something like this before or Id never
been able to stand it so well

UNA as before Your wife

GEORGE Had a good deal more pluck than you though Up and told her
father she would marry me if he liked it or lumped it He said hed cut
her And he did We never seen him since But Naomi and I dont care
Thats her name so you can see shes a Biblepoachers daughter Naomi
and Ive been happier than any people on earth Sternly Shes taught
me to stand when a lady was standing Thats why I wouldnt obey you
Shes teaching me how to speak too and if I do say aint and a
lot of other things I oughtnt to when Im excited that aiisnt her
fault

UNA Then sheNaomihas done everything unusual that I wanted to do
before I did

GEORGE Sure You cant be unusual today Too much brains been in the
world before

UNA How is it I never heard this story if her fathers so well known

GEORGE And my job

BRAITHEWAITE Ill see you still keep it

GEORGE Thanks I dont want to

BRAITHEWAITE No

GEORGE I want a better

BRAITHEWAITE putting his daughter aside Indeed Pray what

GEORGE nonchalantly Superintendent or something I leave it to you
You know more about what jobs there are than I do

BRAITHEWAITE controlling his anger And on what basis do you ask for a
better job

GEORGE Naomi always said my chance would come and I could take it if I
had nerve and my eyes open I think nows the time

BRAITHEWAITE Why

GEORGE Oh this story about your daughter wouldnt look nice

UNA Oh

BRAITHEWAITE You forget the power your fatherinlaw and I have in the
press

GEORGE No I dont But I remember that you cant keep me from
spreading the news among your men And I dont think

BRAITHEWAITE angry and advancing on him I could have you prosecuted
for blackmail sir Have you no honor

GEORGE Sure My honor says provide for your family Ive got the
makings of a big man in me Mr Braithewaite You cant chain me down
with a poor mans morals

BRAITHEWAITE Well I

GEORGE Ill work in any job you give me too Im not asking for a
cinch only a chance If she pointing to UNAcould teach me Naomi
can

BRAITHEWAITE after a pause Well call around at my office in the
morning

GEORGE Thanks He goes out

UNA sitting to weep And I thought I could be unusual

BRAITHEWAITE patting her Its easy enough for Shaw dear He only
writes it

UNA jumping up Thats it Ill write it Ill write a play showing
its useless trying to escape the usual Running up to her father
GEORGES cap in her hands That will be unusual wont it Dad

Reenter GEORGE

GEORGE Excuse me I left my cap

UNA stretching it out to him without looking at him Here it is

GEORGE taking it Thanks Approaching her Buck up Miss You meant
well

UNA I suppose I was too daring

GEORGE If you ask me I think the trouble was you and that Shaw fellow
wasnt daring enough Marriage is a very particular sort of business
Now if youd come up to me in the street and just asked me to UNA
and BRAITHEWAITE look at GEORGE WellII guess Ill go But remember
my tip next try Miss

He goes out quickly leaving UNA gradually grasping the idea and
appreciating it while her fathers shock at what GEORGE has said is
increased only by noticing his daughters reception of the words

CHARACTERS

 HARRIET a cultured woman
 HETTY her primitive self
 MARGARET a cultured woman
 MAGGIE her primitive self

TIME The present

SCENE HARRIETS fashionable livingroom The door at the back leads
to the hall In the centre a tea table with a chair either side At the
back a cabinet

HARRIETS gown is a light jealous green Her counterpart HETTY
wears a gown of the same design but in a darker shade MARGARET wears a
gown of lavender chiffon while her counterpart MAGGIE wears a gown of
the same design in purple a purple scarf veiling her face Chiffon is
used to give a sheer effect suggesting a possibility of primitive
and cultured selves merging into one woman The primitive and cultured
selves never come into actual physical contact but try to sustain the
impression of mental conflict HARRIET never sees HETTY never talks to
her but rather thinks aloud looking into space HETTY however looks at
HARRIET talks intently and shadows her continually The same is true of
MARGARET and MAGGIE The voices of the cultured women are affected
and lingering the voices of the primitive impulsive and more or less
staccato When the curtain rises HARRIET is seated right of tea table
busying herself with the tea things

HETTY Harriet There is no answer Harriet my other self There is
no answer My trained self

HARRIET listens intently Yes From behind HARRIETS chair HETTY
rises slowly

HARRIET Well

HETTY looking at HARRIET admiringly Oh Harriet you are beautiful
today

HARRIET Am I presentable Hetty

HETTY Suits me

HARRIET Ive tried to make the best of the good points

HARRIET I am your subtle overtones

HETTY But together we are one woman the wife of Charles Goodrich

HARRIET There I disagree with you Hetty I alone am his wife

HETTY indignantly Harriet how can you say such a thing

HARRIET Certainly I am the one who flatters him I have to be the one
who talks to him If I gave you a chance you would tell him at once that
you dislike him

HETTY moving away I dont love him thats certain

HARRIET You leave all the fibbing to me He doesnt suspect that my
calm suave manner hides your hatred Considering the amount of scheming
it causes me it can safely be said that he is my husband

HETTY Oh if you love him

HARRIET I I havent any feelings It isnt my business to love
anybody

HETTY Then why need you object to calling him my husband

HARRIET I resent your appropriation of a man who is managed only
through the cleverness of my artifice

HETTY You may be clever enough to deceive him Harriet but I am still
the one who suffers I cant forget he is my husband I cant forget
that I might have married John Caldwell

HARRIET How foolish of you to remember John just because we met his
wife by chance

HETTY Thats what I want to talk to you about She may be here at any
moment I want to advise you about what to say to her this afternoon

HARRIET By all means tell me now and dont interrupt while she is here
You have a most annoying habit of talking to me when people are present
Sometimes it is all I can do to keep my poise and appear not to be
listening to you

HETTY Impress her

HARRIET Hetty dear is it not my custom to impress people

HETTY I hate her

HARRIET I cant let her see that

HETTY I hate her because she married John

HARRIET Only after you had refused him

HETTY turning on HARRIET Was it my fault that I refused him

HARRIET Thats right blame me

HETTY It was your fault You told me he was too poor and never would be
able to do anything in painting Look at him now known in Europe just
returned from eight years in Paris famous

HARRIET It was too poor a gamble at the time It was much safer to
accept Charless money and position

HETTY And then John married Margaret within the year

HARRIET Out of spite

HETTY Freckled gawkylooking thing she was too

HARRIET a little sadly Europe improved her She was stunning the
other morning

HETTY Make her jealous today

HARRIET Shall I be haughty or cordial or caustic or

HETTY Above all else you must let her know that we are rich

HARRIET Oh yes I do that quite easily now

HETTY You must put it on a bit

HARRIET Never fear

HETTY Tell her I love my husband

HARRIET My husband

HETTY Are you going to quarrel with me

HARRIET moves away No I have no desire to quarrel with you It is
quite too uncomfortable I couldnt get away from you if I tried

HETTY stamping her foot and following HARRIET You were a stupid fool
to make me refuse John Ill never forgive younever

HARRIET stopping and holding up her hand Dont get me all excited
Ill be in no condition to meet her properly this afternoon

HETTY passionately I could choke you for robbing me of John

HARRIET retreating Dont muss me

HETTY You dont know how you have made me suffer

HARRIET beginning to feel the strength of HETTYS emotion surge through
her and trying to conquer it It is not my business to have heartaches

HETTY Youre bloodless Nothing but shamshamwhile I

HARRIET emotionally Be quiet I cant let her see that I have been
fighting with my inner self

HETTY And now after all my suffering you say it has cost you more than
it has cost me to be married to Charles But its the pain here in my
heartIve paid the priceIve paidCharles is not your husband

HARRIET trying to conquer emotion He is

HETTY follows HARRIET He isnt

HARRIET weakly He is

HETTY towering over HARRIET He isnt Ill kill you

HARRIET overpowered sinks into a chair Dontdontyoure stronger
than Iyoure

HETTY Say hes mine

HARRIET Hes ours

HETTY the telephone rings There she is now

HETTY hurries to phone but HARRIET regains her supremacy

HARRIET authoritatively Wait I cant let the telephone girl down
there hear my real self It isnt proper At phone Show Mrs
Caldwell up

HETTY Im so excited my hearts in my mouth

HARRIET at the mirror A nice state youve put my nerves into

HETTY Dont let her see youre nervous

HARRIET Quick put the veil on or shell see you shining through me
HARRIET takes a scarf of chiffon that has been lying over the back of a
chair and drapes it on HETTY covering her face The chiffon is the same
color of their gowns but paler in shade so that it pales HETTYS darker
gown to match HARRIETS lighter one As HETTY moves in the following
scene the chiffon falls away revealing now and then the gown of deeper
dye underneath

  The vaudeville production did not use Harriets line
 about the veil because at the rise of the curtain Hetty is
 already veiled in chiffon the same dark green shade as her
 gown


HETTY Tell her Charles is rich and fascinatingboast of our friends
make her feel she needs us

HARRIET Ill make her ask John to paint us

HETTY Thats just my thoughtif John paints our portrait

HARRIET We can wear an exquisite gown

HETTY And make him fall in love again and

HARRIET schemingly Yes

MARGARET parts the portieres back centre and extends her hand MARGARET
is followed by her counterpart MAGGIE Oh MARGARET Im so glad to see
you

HETTY to MAGGIE Thats a lie

MARGARET in superficial voice throughout Its enchanting to see you
Harriet

MAGGIE in emotional voice throughout Id bite you if I dared

HARRIET to MARGARET Wasnt our meeting a stroke of luck

MARGARET coming down left of table Ive thought of you so often
HARRIET and to come back and find you living in New York

HARRIET coming down right of table Mr Goodrich has many interests
here

MAGGIE to MARGARET Flatter her

MARGARET I know Mr Goodrich is so successful

HETTY to HARRIET Tell her were rich

HARRIET to MARGARET Wont you sit down

MARGARET takes a chair What a beautiful cabinet

  What beautiful lamps In vaudeville production

HARRIET Do you like it Im afraid Charles paid an extravagant price

MAGGIE to HETTY I dont believe it

MARGARET sitting down To HARRIET I am sure he must have

HARRIET sitting down How well you are looking Margaret

HETTY Yes you are not There are circles under your eyes

MAGGIE to HETTY I havent eaten since breakfast and Im hungry

MARGARET to HARRIET How well you are looking too

MAGGIE to HETTY You have hard lines about your lips are you happy

HETTY to HARRIET Dont let her know that Im unhappy

HARRIET to MARGARET Why shouldnt I look well My life is full
happy complete

MAGGIE I wonder

HETTY in HARRIETS ear Tell her we have an automobile

MARGARET to HARRIET My life is complete too

MAGGIE My heart is torn with sorrow my husband cannot make a living
He will kill himself if he does not get an order for a painting

MARGARET laughs You must come and see us in our studio John has been
doing some excellent portraits He cannot begin to fill his orders

HETTY to HARRIET Tell her we have an automobile

HARRIET to MARGARET Do you take lemon in your tea

MAGGIE Take cream Its more filling

MARGARET looking nonchalantly at tea things No cream if you please
How cozy

MAGGIE glaring at tea things Only cakes I could eat them all

HARRIET to MARGARET How many lumps

MAGGIE to MARGARET Sugar is nourishing

MARGARET to HARRIET Three please I used to drink very sweet coffee
in Turkey and ever since Ive

HETTY I dont believe you were ever in Turkey

MAGGIE I wasnt but it is none of your business

HARRIET pouring tea Have you been in Turkey do tell me about it

MAGGIE to MARGARET Change the subject

MARGARET to HARRIET You must go there You have so much taste in
dress you would enjoy seeing their costumes

MAGGIE Isnt she going to pass the cake

MARGARET to HARRIET John painted several portraits there

HETTY to HARRIET Why dont you stop her bragging and tell her we have
an automobile

HARRIET offers cake across the table to MARGARET Cake

MAGGIE stands back of MARGARET shadowing her as HETTY shadows HARRIET
MAGGIE reaches claws out for the cake and groans with joy At last
But her claws do not touch the cake

MARGARET with a graceful nonchalant hand places cake upon her plate
and bites at it slowly and delicately Thank you

HETTY to HARRIET Automobile

MAGGIE to MARGARET Follow up the costumes with the suggestion that
she would make a good model for John It isnt too early to begin
getting what you came for

MARGARET ignoring MAGGIE What delicious cake

HETTY excitedly to HARRIET Theres your chance for the auto

HARRIET nonchalantly to MARGARET Yes it is good cake isnt it
There are always a great many people buying it at Harpers I sat in my
automobile fifteen minutes this morning waiting for my chauffeur to get
it

MAGGIE to MARGARET Make her order a portrait

MARGARET to HARRIET If you stopped at Harpers you must have noticed
the new gowns at Hendersons Arent the shop windows alluring these
days

HARRIET Even my chauffeur notices them

MAGGIE I know you have an automobile I heard you the first time

MARGARET I notice gowns now with an artists eye as John does The one
you have on my dear is very paintable

HETTY Dont let her see youre anxious to be painted

HARRIET nonchalantly Oh its just a little model

MAGGIE to MARGARET Dont seem anxious to get the order

MARGARET nonchalantly Perhaps it isnt the gown itself but the way
you wear it that pleases the eye Some people can wear anything with
grace

HETTY Yes Im very graceful

HARRIET to MARGARET You flatter me my dear

MARGARET On the contrary Harriet I have an intense admiration for
you I remember how beautiful you wereas a girl In fact I was quite
jealous when John was paying you so much attention

HETTY She is gloating because I lost him

HARRIET Those were childhood days in a country town

MAGGIE to MARGARET Shes trying to make you feel that John was only a
country boy

MARGARET Most great men have come from the country There is a fair
chance that John will be added to the list

HETTY I know it and I am bitterly jealous of you

HARRIET Undoubtedly he owes much of his success to you Margaret your
experience in economy and your ability to endure hardship Those first
few years in Paris must have been a struggle

MAGGIE She is sneering at your poverty

MARGARET Yes we did find life difficult at first not the luxurious
start a girl has who marries wealth

HETTY to HARRIET Deny that you married Charles for his money
HARRIET deems it wise to ignore HETTYS advice

MARGARET But John and I are so congenial in our tastes that we were
impervious to hardship or unhappiness

HETTY in anguish Do you love each other Is it really true

HARRIET sweetly Did you have all the romance of starving for his art

MAGGIE to MARGARET Shes taunting you Get even with her

MARGARET Not for long Prince Rier soon discovered Johns genius and
introduced him royally to wealthy Parisians who gave him many orders

HETTY to MAGGIE Are you telling the truth or are you lying

HARRIET If he had so many opportunities there you must have had great
inducements to come back to the States

MAGGIE to HETTY We did but not the kind you think

MARGARET John became the rage among Americans travelling in France
too and they simply insisted upon his coming here

HARRIET Whom is he going to paint here

MAGGIE frightened What names dare I make up

MARGARET calmly Just at present Miss Dorothy Ainsworth of Oregon is
posing You may not know the name but she is the daughter of a wealthy
miner who found gold in Alaska

HARRIET I dare say there are many Western people we have never heard
of

MARGARET You must have found social life in New York very interesting
Harriet after the simplicity of our home town

HETTY to MAGGIE Theres no need to remind us that our beginnings were
the same

HARRIET Of course Charless family made everything delightful for me
They are so well connected

MAGGIE to MARGARET Flatter her

MARGARET I heard it mentioned yesterday that you had made yourself very
popular Some one said you were very clever

HARRIET pleased Who told you that

MAGGIE Nobody

MARGARET pleasantly Oh confidences should be suspectedrespected
I mean They said too that you are gaining some reputation as a critic
of art

HARRIET I make no pretenses

MARGARET Are you and Mr Goodrich interested in the same things too

HETTY No

HARRIET Yes indeed Charles and I are inseparable

MAGGIE I wonder

HARRIET Do have another cake

MAGGIE in relief Oh yes Again her claws extend but do not touch
the cake

MARGARET takes cake delicately I really shouldntafter my big
luncheon John took me to the Ritz and we are invited to the Bedfords
for dinnerthey have such a magnificent house near the driveI really
shouldnt but the cakes are so good

MAGGIE Starving

HARRIET to MARGARET More tea

MAGGIE Yes

MARGARET No thank you How wonderfully life has arranged itself for
you Wealth position a happy marriage every opportunity to enjoy all
pleasures beauty arthow happy you must be

HETTY in anguish Dont call me happy Ive never been happy since
I gave up John All these years without hima future without
himnonoI shall win him backaway from youaway from you

HARRIET does not see MAGGIE pointing to cream and MARGARET stealing
some I sometimes think it is unfair for any one to be as happy as I
am Charles and I are just as much in love now as when we married To me
he is just the dearest man in the world

MAGGIE passionately My John is I love him so much I could die for
him Im going through hunger and want to make him great and he loves
me He worships me

MARGARET leisurely to HARRIET I should like to meet Mr Goodrich
Bring him to our studio John has some sketches to show Not many
because all the portraits have been purchased by the subjects He gets
as much as four thousand dollars now

HETTY to HARRIET Dont pay that much

HARRIET to MARGARET As much as that

MARGARET It is not really too much when one considers that John is in
the foremost rank of artists today A picture painted by him now will
double and treble in value

MAGGIE Its all a lie He is growing weak with despair

HARRIET Does he paint all day long

MAGGIE No he draws advertisements for our bread

MARGARET to HARRIET When you and your husband come to see us
telephone first

MAGGIE Yes so he can get the advertisements out of the way

MARGARET Otherwise you might arrive while he has a sitter and John
refuses to let me disturb him then

HETTY Make her ask for an order

HARRIET to MARGARET Le Grange offered to paint me for a thousand

MARGARET Louis Le Granges reputation isnt worth more than that

HARRIET Well Ive heard his work well mentioned

MAGGIE Yes he is doing splendid work

MARGARET Oh dear me no He is only praised by the masses He is
accepted not at all by artists themselves

HETTY anxiously Must I really pay the full price

HARRIET Le Grange thought I would make a good subject

MAGGIE to MARGARET Let her fish for it

MARGARET Of course you would Why dont you let Le Grange paint you if
you trust him

HETTY She doesnt seem anxious to have John do it

HARRIET But if Le Grange isnt accepted by artists it would be a waste
of time to pose for him wouldnt it

MARGARET Yes I think it would

MAGGIE passionately to HETTY across back of table Give us the order
John is so despondent he cant endure much longer Help us Help me
Save us

HETTY to HARRIET Dont seem too eager

HARRIET And yet if he charges only a thousand one might consider it

MARGARET If you really wish to be painted why dont you give a little
more and have a portrait really worth while John might be induced to do
you for a little below his usual price considering that you used to be
such good friends

HETTY in glee Hurrah

HARRIET quietly to MARGARET Thats very nice of you to suggestof
course I dont know

MAGGIE in fear For Gods sake say yes

MARGARET quietly to HARRIET Of course I dont know whether John
would He is very peculiar in these matters He sets his value on his
work and thinks it beneath him to discuss price

HETTY to MAGGIE You neednt try to make us feel small

MARGARET Still I might quite delicately mention to him that inasmuch
as you have many influential friends you would be very glad toto

MAGGIE to HETTY Finish what I dont want to say

HETTY to HARRIET Help her out

HARRIET Oh yes introductions will follow the exhibition of my
portrait No doubt I

HETTY to HARRIET Be patronizing

HARRIET No doubt I shall be able to introduce your husband to his
advantage

MAGGIE relieved Saved

MARGARET If I find John in a propitious mood I shall take pleasure for
your sake in telling him about your beauty Just as you are sitting now
would be a lovely pose

MAGGIE to MARGARET We can go now

HETTY to HARRIET Dont let her think she is doing us a favor

HARRIET It will give me pleasure to add my name to your husbands list
of patronesses

MAGGIE excitedly to MARGARET Run home and tell John the good news

MARGARET leisurely to HARRIET I little guessed when I came for
a pleasant chat about old times that it would develop into business
arrangements I had no idea Harriet that you had any intention of
being painted By Le Grange too Well I came just in time to rescue
you

MAGGIE to MARGARET Run home and tell John Hurry hurry

HETTY to HARRIET You managed the order very neatly She doesnt
suspect that you wanted it

HARRIET Now if I am not satisfied with my portrait I shall blame you
Margaret dear I am relying upon your opinion of Johns talent

MAGGIE to MARGARET She doesnt suspect what you came for Run home
and tell John

HARRIET You always had a brilliant mind Margaret

MARGARET Ah it is you who flatter now

MAGGIE to MARGARET You dont have to stay so long Hurry home

HARRIET Ah one does not flatter when one tells the truth

MARGARET smiles I must be going or you will have me completely under
your spell

HETTY looks at clock Yes do go I have to dress for dinner

HARRIET to MARGARET Oh dont hurry

MAGGIE to HETTY I hate you

MARGARET to HARRIET No really I must but I hope we shall see each
other often at the studio I find you so stimulating

HETTY to MAGGIE I hate you

HARRIET to MARGARET It is indeed gratifying to find a kindred spirit

MAGGIE to HETTY I came for your gold

MARGARET to HARRIET How delightful it is to know you again

HETTY to MAGGIE I am going to make you and your husband suffer

HARRIET My kind regards to John

MAGGIE to HETTY He has forgotten all about you

MARGARET rises He will be so happy to receive them

HETTY to MAGGIE I can hardly wait to talk to him again

HARRIET I shall wait then until you send me word

MARGARET offering her hand Ill speak to John about it as soon as I
can and tell you when to come

HARRIET takes MARGARETS hand affectionately HETTY and MAGGIE rush at
each other throw back their veils and fling their speeches fiercely at
each other

HETTY I love himI love him

MAGGIE Hes starvingIm starving

HETTY Im going to take him away from you

MAGGIE I want your moneyand your influence

HETTY and MAGGIE Im going to rob yourob you

There is a cymbal crash the lights go out and come up again slowly
leaving only MARGARET and HARRIET visible

MARGARET quietly to HARRIET Ive had such a delightful afternoon

HARRIET offering her hand It has been a joy to see you

MARGARET sweetly to HARRIET Goodbye

HARRIET sweetly to MARGARET as she kisses her Goodbye my dear

CHARACTERS

 HELENA the Queen
 TSUMU a black woman slave to Helena
 MENELAUS the King
 ANALYTIKOS the Kings librarian
 PARIS a shepherd

SCENE Is that archeolological mystery a Greek interior A door on the
right leads to the KINGS library one on the left to the apartments of
the QUEEN Back right is the main entrance leading to the palace Next
this running the full length of the wall is a window with a platform
built out over the main court Beyond is a view of hills bright with
lemon groves and in the far distance shimmers the sea On the wall near
the QUEENS room hangs an old shield rusty with disuse A bust of Zeus
stands on a pedestal against the right wall There are low coffers about
the room from which hang the ends of vivid colored robes The scene is
bathed in intense sunlight

TSUMU is massaging the QUEEN

HELENA Theres no doubt about it

TSUMU Analytikos says there is much doubt about all things

HELENA Never mind what he says I envy you your complexion

TSUMU falling prostrate before HELENA Whom the Queen envies should
beware

HELENA annoyed Get up Tsumu You make me nervous tumbling about like
that

TSUMU still on the floor Why does the great Queen envy Tsumu

HELENA Get up you silly She kicks her I envy you because you can
run about and never worry about getting sunburnt

TSUMU on her knees The radiant beauty of the Queen is unspoilable

HELENA Thats just whats worrying me Tsumu When beauty is so perfect
the slightest jar may mean a jolt She goes over and looks at her
reflection in the shield I cant see myself as well as I would like
to The Kings shield is tarnished Menelaus has been too long out of
battle

TSUMU handing her a hand mirror The Gods will keep Sparta free from
strife

HELENA Ill have you beaten if you assume that prophetic tone with me
Theres one thing I cant stand and thats a knowall Flinging the
hand mirror to the floor

TSUMU in alarm Gods grant you havent bent it

HELENA These little mirrors are useless His shield is the only thing
in which I can see myself fulllength If he only went to war hed have
to have it cleaned

TSUMU putting the mirror on a table near the QUEEN The King is a
lover of peace

HELENA The King is a lover of comfort Have you noticed that he spends
more time than he used to in the library

TSUMU He is busy with questions of State

HELENA You know perfectly well that when anythings the matter with the
Government its always straightened out at the other end of the palace
Finish my shoulder She examines her arm I doubt if there is a finer
skin than this in Sparta

TSUMU begins to massage the QUEENS shoulder

HELENA taking up a mirror That touch of deep carmine right here in
the centre of my lips was quite an idea

TSUMU busily pounding the QUEEN An inspiration of the Gods

HELENA The Gods have nothing to do with it I copied it from a low
woman I saw at the circus I cant understand how these bad women have
such good ideas HELENA twists about

TSUMU If your majesty doesnt sit still I may pinch you

HELENA boxing her ears None of your tricks you ebony fiend

TSUMU crouching Descendant of paradise forgive me

HELENA If you bruise my perfect flesh the King will kill you My
beauty is his religion He can sit for hours as if at prayer just
examining the arch of my foot Tsumu you may kiss my foot

TSUMU prostrate May the Gods make me worthy of your kindness

HELENA Thats enough Tsumu are you married

TSUMU getting up Ive been so busy having babies I never had time to
get married

HELENA Its a great disillusionment

TSUMU aghast What

HELENA Im not complaining Moo Moo is the best of husbands but
sometimes being adored too much is trying She sighs deeply I think
Ill wear my heliotrope this afternoon

A trumpet sounds below in the courtyard TSUMU goes to the window

TSUMU They are changing the guards at the gates of the palace Its
almost time for your bath She begins scraping the massage ointment
back into the box

HELENA Youre as careful with that ointment as Moo Moo is with me

TSUMU Precious things need precious guarding

HELENA Its very shortsighted on Moo Moos part to send everybody
to the galleys who dares lift a head when I pass byand all those
nicelooking soldiers Whythe only men I ever see besides Moo Moo are
Analytikos and a lot of useless eunuchs

TSUMU Oh those eunuchs

HELENA as she sits dreaming I wish I wish She stops short

TSUMU You have but to speak your desire to the King

HELENA shocked Tsumu How can you think of such a thing Im not a
bad woman

TSUMU He would die for you

HELENA relieved Ah Do you think so Tsumu

TSUMU All Sparta knows that His Majesty is a lover of peace and yet he
would rush into battle to save you

HELENA I should love to have men fighting for me

TSUMU in high alarm May Zeus turn a deaf ear to your voice

HELENA Dont be impertinent Tsumu Ive got to have some sort of
amusement

TSUMU Youve only to wait till next week and you can see another of
the priestesses sacrificed to Diana

HELENA That doesnt interest me any longer The girls are positively
beginning to like it No My mind is set on war

TSUMU terrified I have five fathers of my children to lose

HELENA War oror

TSUMU hopefully Have I been so long your slave that I no longer know
your wish

HELENA very simply Well I should like to have a lover

TSUMU springs up and rushes over in horror to draw the curtains across
the door to the library All of a tremble Gods grant they didnt hear
you

HELENA Dont be alarmed Tsumu Analytikos is over eighty She bursts
into a loud peal of laughter and MENELAUS rushes into the room

MENELAUS in high irritation I wish you wouldnt make so much noise in
here A King might at least expect quiet in his own palace

HELENA Tsumu see if my bath is ready TSUMU exits You used not
speak like that to me Moo Moo

MENELAUS in a temper How many times must I tell you that my name is
Menelaus and that it isnt Moo Moo

HELENA sweetly Ill never do it again Moo Moo She giggles

MENELAUS Your laugh gets on my nerves Its louder than it used to be

HELENA If you wish it Ill never never laugh again

MENELAUS Youve promised that too often

HELENA sadly Things are not as they used to be

MENELAUS Are you going to start that again

HELENA with a tinge of melancholy I suppose youd like me to be still
and sad

MENELAUS bitterly Is it too much to hope that you might be still and
happy

HELENA speaking very quickly and tragically Dont treat me cruelly
Moo Moo You dont understand me No man ever really understands a
woman There are terrible depths to my nature I had a long talk with
Dr Aesculapius only last week and he told me Im too introspective
Its the curse of us emotional women Im really quite worried but much
you care much you care A note of tears comes into her voice Im
sure you dont love me any more Moo Moo No No Dont answer me If
you did you couldnt speak to me the way you do Ive never wronged
you in deed or in thought No nevernever Ive given up my hopes and
aspirations because I knew you wanted me around you And now NOW
She can contain the tears no longer Because I have neglected my
beauty and because I am old and ugly you regret that Ulysses or
Agamemnon didnt marry me when you all wanted me and I know you curse
the day you ever saw me She is breathless

MENELAUS fuming Well Have you done

HELENA No I could say a great deal more but Im not a talkative
woman

ANALYTIKOS comes in from the library

ANALYTIKOS Your Majesty are we to read no longer today

HELENA I have something to say to the King ANALYTIKOS goes toward the
library MENELAUS anxiously stops him

MENELAUS No Stay here You are a wise man and will understand the
wisdom of the Queen

ANALYTIKOS bowing to HELENA Helena is wise as she is beautiful

MENELAUS She is attempting to prove to me in a thousand words that
shes a silent woman

ANALYTIKOS Women are seldom silent HELENA resents this Their beauty
is forever speaking for them

HELENA The years have indeed taught you wisdom TSUMU enters

TSUMU The almond water awaits Your Majesty

HELENA I hope you havent forgotten the chiropodist

TSUMU He has been commanded but hes always late Hes so busy

HELENA in a purring tone to MENELAUS Moo Moo

MENELAUS bored turns away

HELENA to TSUMU I think after all Ill wear my Sicily blue

She and TSUMU go into the QUEENS apartment

ANALYTIKOS Shall we go back to the library

MENELAUS My mind is unhinged againthat woman with her endless
protestations

ANALYTIKOS I am sorry the poets no longer divert you

MENELAUS A little poetry is always too much

ANALYTIKOS Tomorrow we will try the historians

MENELAUS No Not the historians I want the truth for a change

ANALYTIKOS The truth

MENELAUS Where in books can I find escape from the grim reality of
being hitched for life to such a wife Bah

ANALYTIKOS Philosophy teaches

MENELAUS Why have the Gods made woman necessary to man and made them
fools

ANALYTIKOS For seventy years I have been resolving the problem of woman
and even at my age

MENELAUS Give it up old man The answer isdont

ANALYTIKOS Such endless variety and yet

MENELAUS with the conviction of finality There are only two sorts of
women Those who are failures and those who realize it

ANALYTIKOS Is not Penelope the model wife of your cousin Ulysses an
exception

MENELAUS Duty is the refuge of the unbeautiful She is as commonplace
as she is ugly And then with deep bitterness Why didnt he marry
Helen when we all wanted her He was too wise for that He is the only
man Ive ever known who seems able to direct destiny

ANALYTIKOS You should not blame the Gods for a lack of will

MENELAUS shouting Will Heaven knows I do not lack the will to rid
myself of this painted puppet but where is the instrument ready to my
hand

At this moment a SHEPHERD of Apollonian beauty leaps across the rail of
the balcony and bounds into the room MENELAUS and ANALYTIKOS start back
in amazement

ANALYTIKOS Who are you

PARIS An adventurer

ANALYTIKOS Then you have reached the end of your story In a moment you
will die

PARIS I have no faith in prophets

ANALYTIKOS The soldiers of the King will give you faith Dont you know
that it means death for any man to enter the apartments of the Queen

PARIS looking from one to the other Oh So youre a couple of
eunuchs

Though nearly eighty this is too much for ANALYTIKOS to bear He rushes
to call the guards but MENELAUS stops him

PARIS to ANALYTIKOS Thanks

ANALYTIKOS You thank me for telling you your doom

PARIS Nofor convincing me that Im where I want to be Its taken
me a long while but I knew Id get here And then very intimately to
MENELAUS Wheres the Queen

MENELAUS Where do you come from

PARIS From the hills I had come down into the marketplace to sell
my sheep I had my hood filled with apples They were goldenred like a
thousand sunsets

MENELAUS annoyed You might skip those bucolic details

PARIS At the fair I met three ancient gypsies

MENELAUS What have they to do with you coming here

PARIS You dont seem very patient Cant I tell my story in my own way
They asked me for the apple I was eating and I asked them what theyd
give for it

MENELAUS Im not interested in market quotations

PARIS You take everything so literally Im sure youre easily bored

MENELAUS with meaning I am

PARIS going on cheerfully The first was to give me all the money she
could beg and the second was to tell me all the truth she could learn
by listening and the third promised me a pretty girl So I chose
He hesitates

ANALYTIKOS You cannot escape by spinning out your tale

PARIS Death is the end of one story and the beginning of another

MENELAUS Well Well Come to the point Which did you choose

PARIS smiling Well you see Id been in the hills for a long while
so I picked the girl

ANALYTIKOS It would have been better for you if you had chosen wisdom

PARIS I knew youd say that

ANALYTIKOS I have spoken truly In a moment you will die

PARIS It is because the old have forgotten life that they preach
wisdom

MENELAUS So you chose the girl Well go on

PARIS This made the other cronies angry and when I tossed her the
apple one of the others yelped at me You may as well seek the Queen of
Sparta she is the fairest of women And as I turned away I heard their
laughter but the words had set my heart aflame and though it costs me
my life Ill follow the adventure

ANALYTIKOS scandalized Havent we heard enough of this

MENELAUS deeply No I want to hear how the story ends It may amuse
the King He makes a sign to ANALYTIKOS

PARIS And on the ship at night I looked long at the stars and dreamed
of possessing Helen ANALYTIKOS makes an involuntary movement toward
the balcony but MENELAUS stops him Desire has been my guiding Mercury
the Fates are with me and here I am

ANALYTIKOS The wrath of the King will show you no mercy

PARIS nonchalantly Im not afraid of the King Hes fat anda fool

ANALYTIKOS Shall I call the guards MENELAUS stops him

MENELAUS very significantly So you would give your life for a glimpse
of the Queen

PARIS swiftly Yes My immortal soul and if the fables tell the
truth the sight will be worth the forfeit

MENELAUS suddenly jumping up It shall be as you wish

PARIS buoyantly Venus has smiled on me

MENELAUS In there beyond the library you will find a room with a bath
Wait there till I call you

PARIS Is this some trick to catch me

MENELAUS A Spartan cannot lie

PARIS What will happen to you if the King hears of this

MENELAUS I will answer for the king Go

PARIS exits into the library

ANALYTIKOS rubbing his hands Shall I order the boiling oil

MENELAUS surprised Oil

ANALYTIKOS Now that he is being cleaned for the sacrifice

MENELAUS His torture will be greater than being boiled alive

ANALYTIKOS eagerly Youll have him hurled from the walls of the
palace to a forest of waiting spears below

MENELAUS None is so blind as he who sees too much

ANALYTIKOS Your Majesty is subtle in his cruelty

MENELAUS Havent the years taught you the cheapness of revenge

ANALYTIKOS mystified You do not intend to alter destiny

MENELAUS Never before has destiny been so clear to me

ANALYTIKOS Then the boy must die

MENELAUS with slow determination No He has been sent by the Gods to
save me

ANALYTIKOS Your majesty He is trembling with apprehension

MENELAUS with unbudgeable conviction Helena must elope with him

ANALYTIKOS falling into a seat Ye Gods

MENELAUS quickly I couldnt divorce the Queen That would set a bad
example

ANALYTIKOS Yes very

MENELAUS I couldnt desert her That would be beneath my honor

ANALYTIKOS deeply Was there no other way

MENELAUS pompously The King can do no wrong and besides I hate the
smell of blood Are you a prophet as well as a scholar Will she go

ANALYTIKOS Tonight I will read the stars

MENELAUS meaningfully By tonight Ill not need you to tell me
ANALYTIKOS sits deep in thought Well

ANALYTIKOS Ethics cite no precedent

MENELAUS Do you mean to say Im not justified

ANALYTIKOS cogitating Who can establish the punctilious ratio between
necessity and desire

MENELAUS beginning to fume This is no time for language Just put
yourself in my place

ANALYTIKOS Being you how can I judge as I

MENELAUS losing control May you choke on your dialectics Zeus
himself could have stood it no longer

ANALYTIKOS Have you given her soul a chance to grow

MENELAUS Her soul indeed Its shut in her rouge pot He has been
strutting about Suddenly he sits down crushing a roll of papyrus
He takes it up and in utter disgust reads The perfect hip its
development and permanence Bah He flings it to the floor Ive done
what I had to do and Gods grant the bait may be sweet enough to catch
the Queen

ANALYTIKOS If you had diverted yourself with a war or two you might
have forgotten your troubles at home

MENELAUS frightened I detest dissension of any kindmy dream was
perpetual peace in comfortable domesticity with a womanly woman to warm
my sandals

ANALYTIKOS Is not the Queen

MENELAUS No No The whole world is but her mirror And Im expected to
face that woman every morning at breakfast for the rest of my life and
by Venus thats more than even a King can bear

ANALYTIKOS Even a King cannot alter destiny I warn you whom the Gods
have joined together

MENELAUS in an outburst Is for man to break asunder

ANALYTIKOS deeply shocked You talk like an atheist

MENELAUS I never allow religion to interfere with life Go call the
victim and see that he be left alone with the Queen MENELAUS exits and
ANALYTIKOS goes over to the door of the library and summons PARIS who
enters clad in a gorgeous robe

PARIS I found this in there It looks rather well doesnt it Ah So
youre alone I suppose that stupid friend of yours has gone to tell the
King When do I see the Queen

ANALYTIKOS At once He goes to the door of the QUEENS apartment and
claps his hand TSUMU enters and at the sight of her PARIS recoils the
full length of the room

PARIS I thought the Queen was a blonde

ANALYTIKOS Tell Her Majesty a stranger awaits her here TSUMU exits
her eyes wide on PARIS You should thank the Gods for this moment

PARIS his eyes on the door You do it for me I can never remember all
their names

HELENA enters clad in her Sicily blue crowned with a garland of golden
flowers She and PARIS stand riveted looking at each other Their
attitude might be described as fatalistic ANALYTIKOS watches them for
a moment and then with hands and head lifted to heaven he goes into the
library

PARIS quivering with emotion I have the most strange sensation of
having seen you before Something I cant explain

HELENA quite practically Please dont bother about all sorts of fine
distinctions Under the influence of Analytikos and my husband life has
become a mess of indecision Im a simple direct woman and I expect you
to say just what you think

PARIS Do you Very well then He comes a step nearer to her Fate
is impelling me toward you

HELENA Yes Thats much better So youre a fatalist Its very Greek
I dont see what our dramatists would do without it

PARIS In my country there are no dramatists We are too busy with
reality

HELENA Your people must be uncivilized barbarians

PARIS My people are a genuine people There is but one thing we
worship

HELENA Dont tell me its money

PARIS Its

HELENA Analytikos says if there werent any money there wouldnt be
any of those ridiculous socialists

PARIS It isnt money Its sincerity

HELENA I too believe in sincerity Its the loveliest thing in the
world

PARIS And the most dangerous

HELENA The truth is never dangerous

PARIS Except when told

HELENA making room on the couch for him to sit next to her You
mustnt say wicked things to me

PARIS Can your theories survive a test

HELENA beautifully Truth is eternal and survives all tests

PARIS No Perhaps after all your soul is not ready for the supremest
heights

HELENA Do you mean to say Im not religious Religion teaches the
meaning of love

PARIS Has it taught you to love your husband

HELENA starting up and immediately sitting down again How dare you
speak to me like that

PARIS You see I was right He goes toward the balcony

HELENA stopping him Whatever made you think so

PARIS Ive heard people talk of the King You could never love a man
like that

HELENA beautifully A womans first duty is to love her husband

PARIS There is a higher right than duty

HELENA with conviction Right is right

PARIS with admiration The world has libelled you

HELENA Me The Queen

PARIS You are as wise as you are beautiful

HELENA smiling coyly Why you hardly know me

PARIS I know you I better than all men

HELENA You

PARIS rapturously Human law has given you to Menelaus but divine law
makes you mine

HELENA in amazement What

PARIS I alone appreciate your beauty I alone can reach your soul

HELENA Ah

PARIS You hate your husband

HELENA drawing back Why do you look at me like that

PARIS To see if theres one woman in the world who dares tell the
truth

HELENA My husband doesnt understand me

PARIS with conviction I knew you detested him

HELENA He never listens to my aspirations

PARIS Egoist

HELENA assuming an irresistible pose Im tired of being only lovely
He doesnt realize the meaning of spiritual intercourse of soul
communion

PARIS Fool

HELENA You dare call Moo Moo a fool

PARIS Has he not been too blind to see that your soul outshines your
beauty Then very dramatically Youre stifling

HELENA clearing her throat II

PARIS He has made you sit upon your wings HELENA jumping up shifts
her position You are groping in the darkness

HELENA Dont be silly Its very light in here

PARIS undisturbed You are stumbling and I have come to lead you He
steps toward her

HELENA Stop right there PARIS stops No man but the King can come
within ten feet of me Its a court tradition

PARIS Necessity knows no tradition He falls on his knees before her
I shall come close to you though the flame of your beauty consume me

HELENA Youd better be careful what you say to me Remember Im the
Queen

PARIS No man weighs his words who has but a moment to live

HELENA You said that exactly like an actor He leans very close to
her What are you doing now

PARIS I am looking into you You are the clear glass in which I read
the secret of the universe

HELENA The secret of the universe Ah Perhaps you could understand me

PARIS First you must understand yourself

HELENA instinctively taking up a mirror How

PARIS You must break with all this prose With an unconscious gesture
he sweeps a tray of toilet articles from the table HELENA emits a
little shriek

HELENA The ointment

PARIS rushing to the window and pointing to the distance And climb to
infinite poesie

HELENA catching his enthusiasm says very blandly There is nothing in
the world like poetry

PARIS lyrically Have you ever heard the poignant breathing of the
stars

HELENA No I dont believe in astrology

PARIS Have you ever smelt the powdery mists of the sun

HELENA I should sneeze myself to death

PARIS Have you ever listened to the sapphire soul of the sea

HELENA Has the sea a soul But please dont stop talking You do it so
beautifully

PARIS Deeds are sweeter than words Shall we go hand in hand to meet
eternity

HELENA not comprehending him Thats very pretty Say it again

PARIS passionately Theres but a moment of life left me I shall
stifle it in ecstasy Helena Helena I adore you

HELENA jumping up in high surprise Youre not making love to me you
naughty boy

PARIS Helena

HELENA Youve spoken to me so little and already you dare to do that

PARIS impetuously I am a lover of life I skip the inessentials

HELENA Remember who I am

PARIS I have not forgotten Daughter of Heaven Suddenly he leaps to
his feet Listen

HELENA Shhh Thats the King and Analytikos in the library

PARIS No No Dont you hear the flutter of wings

HELENA Wings

PARIS ecstatically Venus mother of Love

HELENA alarmed What is it

PARIS She has sent her messenger I hear the patter of little feet

HELENA Those little feet are the soldiers below in the courtyard A
trumpet sounds

PARIS the truth of the situation breaking through his emotion In a
moment I shall be killed

HELENA Killed

PARIS Save me and save yourself

HELENA Myself

PARIS I shall rescue you and lead you on to life

HELENA No one has ever spoken to me like that before

PARIS This is the first time your ears have heard the truth

HELENA Was it of you Ive been dreaming

PARIS Your dream was but your unrealized desire

HELENA Menelaus has never made me feel like this And then with a
sudden shriek Oh Im a wicked woman

PARIS No No

HELENA For years Ive been living with a man I didnt love

PARIS Yes Yes

HELENA Im lost

PARIS at a loss No Yes Yes No

HELENA It was a profanation of the most holy

PARIS The holiest awaits you Helena Our love will lighten the
Plutonian realms

HELENA Menelaus never spoke to me like that

PARIS Tis but the first whisper of my adoration

HELENA I cant face him every morning at breakfast for the rest of my
life Thats even more than a Queen can bear

PARIS I am waiting to release you

HELENA Ive stood it for seven years

PARIS Ive been coming to you since the beginning of time

HELENA There is something urging me to go with you something I do not
understand

PARIS Quick There is but a moment left us He takes her rapturously
in his arms There is a passionate embrace in the midst of which TSUMU
enters

TSUMU The chiropodist has come

HELENA Bring me my outer garment and my purse

TSUMU exits her eyes wide on PARIS

PARIS Helena Helena

HELENA looks about her and takes up the papyrus that MENELAUS has flung
to the floor

HELENA A last word to the King She looks at the papyrus No this
wont do I shall have to take this with me

PARIS What is it

HELENA Maskandas discourse on the hip

A trumpet sounds below in the courtyard

PARIS excitedly Leave itor your hip may cost me my head We havent
a minute to spare Hurry Hurry

HELENA takes up an eyebrow pencil and writes on the back of the
papyrus She looks for a place to put it and seeing the shield she
smears it with some of the ointment and sticks the papyrus to it

PARIS watching her in ecstasy You are the fairest of all fair women
and your name will blaze as a symbol throughout eternity TSUMU enters
with the purse and the QUEENS outer robe

HELENA tossing the purse to PARIS Here we may need this

PARIS throwing it back to TSUMU This for your silence daughter of
darkness A prince has no heed of purses

TSUMU looking at him A prince

HELENA gloriously My prince of poetry My deliverer

PARIS divinely My queen of love

They go out TSUMU looking after them in speechless amazement Suddenly
she sees the papyrus on the shield runs over and reads it and then
rushes to the door of the library

TSUMU calling Analytikos She hides the purse in her bosom
ANALYTIKOS enters scroll in hand

ANALYTIKOS Has the Queen summoned me

TSUMU mysteriously A terrible thing has happened

ANALYTIKOS Whats the matter

TSUMU Wheres the King

ANALYTIKOS In the library

TSUMU I have news more precious than the gold of Midas

ANALYTIKOS giving her a purse Well What is it

TSUMU speaking very dramatically and watching the effect of her words
The Queen has deserted Menelaus

ANALYTIKOS receiving the shock philosophically Swift are the ways of
Nature The Gods have smiled upon him

TSUMU The Gods have forsaken the King to smile upon a prince

ANALYTIKOS What

TSUMU He was a prince

ANALYTIKOS apprehensively Why do you say that

TSUMU clutching her bosom I have a good reason to know There is a
sound of voices below in the courtyard MENELAUS rushes in expectantly
TSUMU falls prostrate before him Oh King in thy bottomless agony
blame not a blameless negress The Queen has fled

MENELAUS in his delight forgetting himself and flinging her a purse
Is it true

TSUMU Woe Woe is me

MENELAUS storming Out of my sight you eyeless Argus

ANALYTIKOS to TSUMU Quick send a messenger Find out who he was
TSUMU sticks the third purse in her bosom and runs out

MENELAUS with radiant happiness kneeling before the bust of Zeus
Ye Gods I thank ye Peace and a happy life at last The shouts in the
courtyard grow louder

ANALYTIKOS The news has spread through the palace

MENELAUS in trepidation springing up No one would dare stop the
progress of the Queen

TSUMU rushes in and prostrates herself before the KING Woe is me
They have gone by the road to the harbor

MENELAUS anxiously Yes Yes

TSUMU By the Kings orders no man has dared gaze upon Her Majesty They
all fell prostrate before her

MENELAUS Good Good Attempting to cover his delight Go Go You
garrulous dog TSUMU gets up and points to shield ANALYTIKOS and the
KING look toward it ANALYTIKOS tears off the papyrus and brings it to
MENELAUS TSUMU watching them exits

MENELAUS reading I am not a bad woman I did what I had to do
How Greek to blame fate for what one wants to do TSUMU again comes
tumbling in

TSUMU again prostrate before the KING A rumor flies through the city
Hehe

ANALYTIKOS anxiously Well Well

TSUMU Hehe

MENELAUS furiously to ANALYTIKOS Rid me of this croaking raven

TSUMU Evil has fallen on Sparta He

ANALYTIKOS Yesyes

MENELAUS in a rage Out of my sight perfidious Nubian Sounds of
confusion in the courtyard Suddenly she springs to her feet and yells
at the top of her voice

TSUMU He was Paris Prince of Troy

They all start back ANALYTIKOS stumbles into a seat MENELAUS turns
pale TSUMU leers like a black Nemesis

ANALYTIKOS very ominously Who can read the secret of the Fates

MENELAUS frightened What do you mean

ANALYTIKOS He is the son of Priam King of Troy

TSUMU adding fuel And of Hecuba Queen of the Trojans She rushes
out to spread the news

ANALYTIKOS That makes the matter international

MENELAUS quickly But we have treaties with Troy

ANALYTIKOS Circumstances alter treaties They will mean nothing

MENELAUS Nothing

ANALYTIKOS No more than a scrap of papyrus Sparta will fight to regain
her Queen

MENELAUS But I dont want her back

ANALYTIKOS Can you tell that to Sparta Remember the King can do no
wrong Last night I dreamed of war

MENELAUS No No Dont say that After the scandal I cant be expected
to fight to get her back

ANALYTIKOS Sparta will see with the eyes of chivalry

MENELAUS fuming But I dont believe in war

ANALYTIKOS still obdurate Have you forgotten the oath pledged of old
with Ulysses and Agamemnon They have sworn if ever the time came to
fight and defend the Queen

MENELAUS bitterly I didnt think of the triple alliance

ANALYTIKOS Can Sparta ask less of her King

MENELAUS Lets hear the other side We can perhaps arbitrate Peace at
any price

ANALYTIKOS Some bargains are too cheap

MENELAUS hopelessly But I am a pacifist

ANALYTIKOS You are Menelaus of Sparta and Spartas a nation of
soldiers

MENELAUS desperately I am too proud to fight

ANALYTIKOS Here put on your shield A great clamor comes up from
the courtyard ANALYTIKOS steps out on the balcony and is greeted with
shouts of The King The King Addressing the crowd People of Sparta
this calamity has been forced upon us

MENELAUS winces We are a peaceful people But thanks to our
unparalleled efficiency the military system of Sparta is the most
powerful in all Greece and we can mobilize in half an hour

Loud acclaims from the people MENELAUS the papyrus still in hand
crawls over and attempts to stop ANALYTIKOS

ANALYTIKOS not noticing him In the midst of connubial and communal
peace the thunderbolt has fallen on the KingMENELAUS tugs at
ANALYTIKOS robe Broken in spirit as he is he is already pawing the
ground like a battle steed Never will we lay down our arms We and
Jupiter Cheers Never until the Queen is restored to Menelaus Never
even if it takes ten years

MENELAUS squirms A loud cheer

HELENAS HUSBAND Even now the King is buckling on his shield More
cheers ANALYTIKOS steps farther forward and then with bursting
eloquence

 One hate we have and one alone Yells from below
 Hate by water and hate by land
 Hate of the head and hate of the hand
 Hate of Paris and hate of Troy
 That has broken the Queen for a moments toy
 The yells grow fiercer
 Zeus thunder will shatter the Trojan throne
 We have one hate and one alone

MENELAUS sits on the floor dejectedly looking at the papyrus A thunder
of voices from the people

We have one hate and one alone Troy Troy

Helmets and swords are thrown into the air The cheers grow tumultuous
trumpets are blown and the curtain falls

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
