ALL ROADS LEAD TO CALVARY


CHAPTER I


She had not meant to stay for the service The door had stood invitingly
open and a glimpse of the interior had suggested to her the idea that it
would make good copy Old London Churches Their Social and Historical
Associations It would be easy to collect anecdotes of the famous
people who had attended them She might fix up a series for one of the
religious papers It promised quite exceptional material this
particular specimen rich in tombs and monuments There was character
about it a scent of bygone days She pictured the vanished
congregations in their powdered wigs and stiff brocades How picturesque
must have been the marriages that had taken place there say in the reign
of Queen Anne or of the early Georges The church would have been
ancient even then With its air of faded grandeur its sculptured
recesses and dark niches the tattered banners hanging from its roof it
must have made an admirable background Perhaps an historical novel in
the Thackeray vein She could see her heroine walking up the aisle on
the arm of her proud old soldier father Later on when her journalistic
position was more established she might think of it It was still quite
early There would be nearly half an hour before the first worshippers
would be likely to arrive just time enough to jot down a few notes If
she did ever take to literature it would be the realistic school she
felt that would appeal to her The rest too would be pleasant after
her long walk from Westminster She would find a secluded seat in one of
the high stiff pews and let the atmosphere of the place sink into her

And then the pewopener had stolen up unobserved and had taken it so for
granted that she would like to be shown round and had seemed so pleased
and eager that she had not the heart to repel her A curious little old
party with a smooth peachlike complexion and white soft hair that the
fading twilight stealing through the yellow glass turned to gold So
that at first sight Joan took her for a child The voice too was so
absurdly childishappealing and yet confident Not until they were
crossing the aisle where the clearer light streamed in through the open
doors did Joan see that she was very old and feeble with about her
figure that curious patient droop that comes to the workworn She
proved to be most interesting and full of helpful information Mary
Stopperton was her name She had lived in the neighbourhood all her
life had as a girl worked for the Leigh Hunts and had assisted Mrs
Carlyle She had been very frightened of the great man himself and had
always hidden herself behind doors or squeezed herself into corners and
stopped breathing whenever there had been any fear of meeting him upon
the stairs Until one day having darted into a cupboard to escape from
him and drawn the door to after her it turned out to be the cupboard in
which Carlyle was used to keep his boots So that there was quite a
struggle between them she holding grimly on to the door inside and
Carlyle equally determined to open it and get his boots It had ended in
her exposure with trembling knees and scarlet face and Carlyle had
addressed her as woman and had insisted on knowing what she was doing
there And after that she had lost all terror of him And he had even
allowed her with a grim smile to enter occasionally the sacred study with
her broom and pan It had evidently made a lasting impression upon her
that privilege

They didnt get on very well together Mr and Mrs Carlyle Joan
queried scenting the opportunity of obtaining firstclass evidence

There wasnt much difference so far as I could see between them and
most of us answered the little old lady Youre not married dear
she continued glancing at Joans ungloved hand but people must have a
deal of patience when they have to live with us for twentyfour hours a
day You see little things we do and say without thinking and little
ways we have that we do not notice ourselves may all the time be
irritating to other people

What about the other people irritating us suggested Joan

Yes dear and of course that can happen too agreed the little old
lady

Did he Carlyle ever come to this church asked Joan

Mary Stopperton was afraid he never had in spite of its being so near
And yet he was a dear good Christianin his way Mary Stopperton felt
sure

How do you mean in his way demanded Joan It certainly if Froude
was to be trusted could not have been the orthodox way

Well you see dear explained the little old lady he gave up things
He could have ridden in his carriageshe was quoting it seemed the
words of the Carlyles old servantif hed written the sort of lies
that people pay for being told instead of throwing the truth at their
head

But even that would not make him a Christian argued Joan

It is part of it dear isnt it insisted Mary Stopperton To suffer
for ones faith I think Jesus must have liked him for that

They had commenced with the narrow strip of burial ground lying between
the south side of the church and Cheyne Walk And there the little pew
opener had showed her the grave of Anna afterwards Mrs Spragg Who
long declining wedlock and aspiring above her sex fought under her
brother with arms and manly attire in a flagship against the French As
also of Mary Astell her contemporary who had written a spirited Essay
in Defence of the Fair Sex So there had been a Suffrage Movement as
far back as in the days of Pope and Swift

Returning to the interior Joan had duly admired the Cheyne monument but
had been unable to disguise her amusement before the tomb of Mrs
Colvile whom the sculptor had represented as a somewhat impatient lady
refusing to await the day of resurrection but pushing through her coffin
and starting for Heaven in her graveclothes Pausing in front of the
Dacre monument Joan wondered if the actor of that name who had
committed suicide in Australia and whose London address she remembered
had been Dacre House just round the corner was descended from the
family thinking that if so it would give an uptodate touch to the
article She had fully decided now to write it But Mary Stopperton
could not inform her They had ended up in the chapel of Sir Thomas
More He too had given up things including his head Though Mary
Stopperton siding with Father Morris was convinced he had now got it
back and that with the remainder of his bones it rested in the tomb
before them

There the little pewopener had left her having to show the
earlycomers to their seats and Joan had found an outoftheway pew
from where she could command a view of the whole church They were
chiefly poor folk the congregation with here and there a sprinkling of
faded gentility They seemed in keeping with the place The twilight
faded and a snuffy old man shuffled round and lit the gas

It was all so sweet and restful Religion had never appealed to her
before The businesslike service in the bare cold chapel where she had
sat swinging her feet and yawning as a child had only repelled her She
could recall her father aloof and aweinspiring in his Sunday black
passing round the bag Her mother always veiled sitting beside her a
thin tall woman with passionate eyes and ever restless hands the women
mostly overdressed and the sleek prosperous men trying to look meek At
school and at Girton chapel which she had attended no oftener than she
was obliged had had about it the same atmosphere of chill compulsion
But here was poetry She wondered if after all religion might not have
its place in the worldin company with the other arts It would be a
pity for it to die out There seemed nothing to take its place All
these lovely cathedrals these dear little old churches that for
centuries had been the focus of mens thoughts and aspirations The
harbour lights illumining the troubled waters of their lives What
could be done with them They could hardly be maintained out of the
public funds as mere mementoes of the past Besides there were too many
of them The taxpayer would naturally grumble As Town Halls Assembly
Rooms The idea was unthinkable It would be like a performance of
Barnums Circus in the Coliseum at Rome Yes they would disappear
Though not she was glad to think in her time In towns the space
would be required for other buildings Here and there some gradually
decaying specimen would be allowed to survive taking its place with the
feudal castles and walled cities of the Continent the joy of the
American tourist the textbook of the antiquary A pity Yes but then
from the aesthetic point of view it was a pity that the groves of ancient
Greece had ever been cut down and replanted with currant bushes their
altars scattered that the stones of the temples of Isis should have come
to be the shelter of the fisher of the Nile and the corn wave in the
wind above the buried shrines of Mexico All these dead truths that from
time to time had encumbered the living world Each in its turn had had
to be cleared away

And yet was it altogether a dead truth this passionate belief in a
personal God who had ordered all things for the best who could be
appealed to for comfort for help Might it not be as good an
explanation as any other of the mystery surrounding us It had been so
universal She was not sure where but somewhere she had come across an
analogy that had strongly impressed her The fact that a man feels
thirstythough at the time he may be wandering through the Desert of
Saharaproves that somewhere in the world there is water Might not
the success of Christianity in responding to human needs be evidence in
its favour The Love of God the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost the Grace
of Our Lord Jesus Christ Were not all human needs provided for in that
one comprehensive promise the desperate need of man to be convinced that
behind all the seeming muddle was a loving hand guiding towards good the
need of the soul in its loneliness for fellowship for strengthening the
need of man in his weakness for the kindly grace of human sympathy of
human example

And then as fate would have it the first lesson happened to be the
story of Jonah and the whale Half a dozen shocked faces turned suddenly
towards her told Joan that at some point in the thrilling history she
must unconsciously have laughed Fortunately she was alone in the pew
and feeling herself scarlet squeezed herself into its farthest corner
and drew down her veil

No it would have to go A religion that solemnly demanded of grown men
and women in the twentieth century that they should sit and listen with
reverential awe to a prehistoric edition of Grimms Fairy Stories
including Noah and his ark the adventures of Samson and Delilah the
conversations between Balaam and his ass and culminating in what if it
were not so appallingly wicked an idea would be the most comical of them
all the conception of an elaborately organized Hell into which the God
of the Christians plunged his creatures for all eternity Of what use
was such a religion as that going to be to the world of the future

She must have knelt and stood mechanically for the service was ended
The pulpit was occupied by an elderly uninterestinglooking man with a
troublesome cough But one sentence he had let fall had gripped her
attention For a moment she could not remember it and then it came to
her All Roads lead to Calvary It struck her as rather good Perhaps
he was going to be worth listening to To all of us sooner or later
he was saying comes a choosing of two ways either the road leading to
success the gratification of desires the honour and approval of our
fellowmenor the path to Calvary

And then he had wandered off into a maze of detail The tradesman
dreaming perhaps of becoming a Whiteley having to choose whether to go
forward or remain for all time in the little shop The statesmanshould
he abide by the faith that is in him and suffer loss of popularity or
renounce his God and enter the Cabinet The artist the writer the mere
labourerthere were too many of them A few wellchosen examples would
have sufficed And then that irritating cough

And yet every now and then he would be arresting In his prime Joan
felt he must have been a great preacher Even now decrepit and wheezy
he was capable of flashes of magnetism of eloquence The passage where
he pictured the Garden of Gethsemane The fair Jerusalem only hidden
from us by the shadows So easy to return to Its soft lights shining
through the trees beckoning to us its mingled voices stealing to us
through the silence whispering to us of its wellremembered ways its
pleasant places its open doorways friends and loved ones waiting for
us And above the rockstrewn Calvary and crowning its summit clear
against the starlit sky the cold dark cross Not perhaps to us the
bleeding hands and feet but to all the bitter tears Our Calvary may be
a very little hill compared with the mountains where Prometheus suffered
but to us it is steep and lonely

There he should have stopped It would have been a good note on which to
finish But it seemed there was another point he wished to make Even
to the sinner Calvary calls To Judaseven to him the gates of the life
giving Garden of Gethsemane had not been closed With his thirty pieces
of silver he could have stolen away In some distant crowded city of the
Roman Empire have lived unknown forgotten Life still had its
pleasures its rewards To him also had been given the choice The
thirty pieces of silver that had meant so much to him He flings them at
the feet of his tempters They would not take them back He rushes out
and hangs himself Shame and death With his own hands he will build
his own cross none to help him He tooeven Judas climbs his
Calvary Enters into the fellowship of those who through all ages have
trod its stony pathway

Joan waited till the last of the congregation had disappeared and then
joined the little pewopener who was waiting to close the doors Joan
asked her what she had thought of the sermon but Mary Stopperton being
a little deaf had not heard it

It was quite goodthe matter of it Joan told her All Roads lead to
Calvary The idea is that there comes a time to all of us when we have
to choose Whether like your friend Carlyle we will give up things
for our faiths sake Or go for the carriage and pair

Mary Stopperton laughed He is quite right dear she said It does
seem to come and it is so hard You have to pray and pray and pray And
even then we cannot always do it She touched with her little withered
fingers Joans fine white hand But you are so strong and brave she
continued with another little laugh It wont be so difficult for
you

It was not until well on her way home that Joan recalling the
conversation found herself smiling at Mary Stoppertons literal
acceptation of the argument At the time she remembered the shadow of
a fear had passed over her

Mary Stopperton did not know the name of the preacher It was quite
common for chance substitutes to officiate there especially in the
evening Joan had insisted on her acceptance of a shilling and had made
a note of her address feeling instinctively that the little old woman
would come in useful from a journalistic point of view

Shaking hands with her she had turned eastward intending to walk to
Sloane Square and there take the bus At the corner of Oakley Street she
overtook him He was evidently a stranger to the neighbourhood and was
peering up through his glasses to see the name of the street and Joan
caught sight of his face beneath a gas lamp

And suddenly it came to her that it was a face she knew In the dimlit
church she had not seen him clearly He was still peering upward Joan
stole another glance Yes she had met him somewhere He was very
changed quite different but she was sure of it It was a long time
ago She must have been quite a child




CHAPTER II


One of Joans earliest recollections was the picture of herself standing
before the high cheval glass in her mothers dressingroom Her clothes
lay scattered far and wide falling where she had flung them not a shred
of any kind of covering was left to her She must have been very small
for she could remember looking up and seeing high above her head the two
brass knobs by which the glass was fastened to its frame Suddenly out
of the upper portion of the glass there looked a scared red face It
hovered there a moment and over it in swift succession there passed the
expressions first of petrified amazement secondly of shocked
indignation and thirdly of righteous wrath And then it swooped down
upon her and the image in the glass became a confusion of small naked
arms and legs mingled with green cotton gloves and purple bonnet strings

You young imp of Satan demanded Mrs Mundayher feelings of outraged
virtue exaggerating perhaps her real sentiments What are you doing

Go away Ise looking at myself had explained Joan struggling
furiously to regain the glass

But where are your clothes was Mrs Mundays wonder

Ise tooked them off explained Joan A piece of information that
really all things considered seemed unnecessary

But cant you see yourself you wicked child without stripping yourself
as naked as you were born

No maintained Joan stoutly I hate clothes As a matter of fact
she didnt even in those early days On the contrary one of her
favourite amusements was dressing up This sudden overmastering desire
to arrive at the truth about herself had been a new conceit

I wanted to see myself Clothes aint me was all she would or could
vouchsafe and Mrs Munday had shook her head and had freely confessed
that there were things beyond her and that Joan was one of them and had
succeeded partly by force partly by persuasion in restoring to Joan
once more the semblance of a Christian child

It was Mrs Munday poor soul who all unconsciously had planted the
seeds of disbelief in Joans mind Mrs Mundays God from Joans point
of view was a most objectionable personage He talked a lotor rather
Mrs Munday talked for Himabout His love for little children But it
seemed He only loved them when they were good Joan was under no
delusions about herself If those were His terms well then so far as
she could see He wasnt going to be of much use to her Besides if He
hated naughty children why did He make them naughty At a moderate
estimate quite half Joans wickedness so it seemed to Joan came to her
unbidden Take for example that selfexamination before the cheval
glass The idea had come into her mind It had never occurred to her
that it was wicked If as Mrs Munday explained it was the Devil that
had whispered it to her then what did God mean by allowing the Devil to
go about persuading little girls to do indecent things God could do
everything Why didnt He smash the Devil It seemed to Joan a mean
trick look at it how you would Fancy leaving a little girl to fight
the Devil all by herself And then get angry because the Devil won Joan
came to cordially dislike Mrs Mundays God

Looking back it was easy enough to smile but the agony of many nights
when she had lain awake for hours battling with her childish terrors had
left a burning sense of anger in Joans heart Poor mazed bewildered
Mrs Munday preaching the eternal damnation of the wickedwho had loved
her who had only thought to do her duty the blame was not hers But
that a religion capable of inflicting such suffering upon the innocent
should still be preached maintained by the State That its educated
followers no longer believed in a physical Hell that its more advanced
clergy had entered into a conspiracy of silence on the subject was no
answer The great mass of the people were not educated Official
Christendom in every country still preached the everlasting torture of
the majority of the human race as a well thought out part of the
Creators scheme No leader had been bold enough to come forward and
denounce it as an insult to his God As one grew older kindly mother
Nature ever seeking to ease the selfinflicted burdens of her foolish
brood gave one forgetfulness insensibility The condemned criminal
puts the thought of the gallows away from him as long as may be eats
and sleeps and even jokes Mans soul grows pachydermoid But the
children Their sensitive brains exposed to every cruel breath No
philosophic doubt permitted to them No learned disputation on the
relationship between the literal and the allegorical for the easing of
their frenzied fears How many million tiny whitefaced figures
scattered over Christian Europe and America stared out each night into a
vision of black horror how many million tiny hands clutched wildly at
the bedclothes The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
if they had done their duty would have prosecuted before now the
Archbishop of Canterbury

Of course she would go to Hell As a special kindness some generous
relative had on Joans seventh birthday given her an edition of Dantes
Inferno with illustrations by Dore From it she was able to form some
notion of what her eternity was likely to be And God all the while up
in His Heaven surrounded by that glorious band of praisetrumpeting
angels watching her out of the corner of His eye Her courage saved her
from despair Defiance came to her aid Let Him send her to Hell She
was not going to pray to Him and make up to Him He was a wicked God
Yes He was a cruel wicked God And one night she told Him so to His
face

It had been a pretty crowded day even for so busy a sinner as little
Joan It was springtime and they had gone into the country for her
mothers health Maybe it was the season a stirring of the human sap
conducing to that feeling of being too big for ones boots as the
saying is A dangerous period of the year Indeed on the principle
that prevention is better than cure Mrs Munday had made it a custom
during April and May to administer to Joan a cooling mixture but on this
occasion had unfortunately come away without it Joan dressed for use
rather than show and without either shoes or stockings had stolen
stealthily downstairs something seemed to be calling to her
Silentlylike a thief in the night to adopt Mrs Mundays
metaphorhad slipped the heavy bolts had joined the thousand creatures
of the woodhad danced and leapt and shouted had behaved in short
more as if she had been a Pagan nymph than a happy English child She
had regained the house unnoticed as she thought the Devil no doubt
assisting her and had hidden her wet clothes in the bottom of a mighty
chest Deceitfulness in her heart she had greeted Mrs Munday in sleepy
tones from beneath the sheets and before breakfast assailed by
suspicious questions had told a deliberate lie Later in the morning
during an argument with an active young pig who was willing enough to
play at Red Riding Hood so far as eating things out of a basket was
concerned but who would not wear a nightcap she had used a wicked
word In the afternoon she might have killed the farmers only son and
heir They had had a row In one of those sad lapses from the higher
Christian standards into which Satan was always egging her she had
pushed him and he had tumbled head over heels into the horsepond The
reason that instead of lying there and drowning he had got up and walked
back to the house howling fit to wake the Seven Sleepers was that God
watching over little children had arranged for the incident taking place
on that side of the pond where it was shallow Had the scrimmage
occurred on the opposite bank beneath which the water was much deeper
Joan in all probability would have had murder on her soul It seemed to
Joan that if God allpowerful and allforeseeing had been so careful in
selecting the site He might with equal ease have prevented the row from
ever taking place Why couldnt the little beast have been guided back
from school through the orchard much the shorter way instead of being
brought round by the yard so as to come upon her at a moment when she
was feeling a bit shorttempered to put it mildly And why had God
allowed him to call her Carrots That Joan should have put it this
way instead of going down on her knees and thanking the Lord for having
saved her from a crime was proof of her inborn evil disposition In the
evening was reached the culminating point Just before going to bed she
had murdered old George the cowman For all practical purposes she might
just as well have been successful in drowning William Augustus earlier in
the day It seemed to be one of those things that had to be Mr
Hornflower still lived it was true but that was not Joans fault Joan
standing in white nightgown beside her bed everything around her
breathing of innocence and virtue the spotless bedclothes the chintz
curtains the white hyacinths upon the windowledge Joans Bible a
present from Aunt Susan her prayerbook handsomely bound in calf a
present from Grandpapa upon their little table Mrs Munday in evening
black and cameo brooch pale red with tomb and weeping willow in white
relief sacred to the memory of the departed Mr MundayJoan standing
there erect with pale passionate face defying all these aids to
righteousness had deliberately wished Mr Hornflower dead Old George
Hornflower it was who unseen by her had passed her that morning in the
wood Grumpy old George it was who had overheard the wicked word with
which she had cursed the pig who had met William Augustus on his
emergence from the pond To Mr George Hornflower the humble instrument
in the hands of Providence helping her towards possible salvation she
ought to have been grateful And instead of that she had flung into the
agonized face of Mrs Munday these awful words

I wish he was dead

He who in his heart there was verse and chapter for it Joan was a
murderess Just as well so far as Joan was concerned might she have
taken a carvingknife and stabbed Deacon Hornflower to the heart

Joans prayers that night to the accompaniment of Mrs Mundays sobs
had a hopeless air of unreality about them Mrs Mundays kiss was cold

How long Joan lay and tossed upon her little bed she could not tell
Somewhere about the middle of the night or so it seemed to her the
frenzy seized her Flinging the bedclothes away she rose to her feet It
is difficult to stand upon a spring mattress but Joan kept her balance
Of course He was there in the room with her God was everywhere spying
upon her She could distinctly hear His measured breathing Face to
face with Him she told Him what she thought of Him She told Him He was
a cruel wicked God

There are no Victoria Crosses for sinners or surely little Joan that
night would have earned it It was not lack of imagination that helped
her courage God and she alone in the darkness He with all the forces
of the Universe behind Him He armed with His eternal pains and
penalties and eightyearold Joan the creature that He had made in His
Own Image that He could torture and destroy Hell yawned beneath her
but it had to be said Somebody ought to tell Him

You are a wicked God Joan told Him Yes You are A cruel wicked
God

And then that she might not see the walls of the room open before her
hear the wild laughter of the thousand devils that were coming to bear
her off she threw herself down her face hidden in the pillow and
clenched her hands and waited

And suddenly there burst a song It was like nothing Joan had ever heard
before So clear and loud and near that all the night seemed filled with
harmony It sank into a tender yearning cry throbbing with passionate
desire and then it rose again in thrilling ecstasy a song of hope of
victory

Joan trembling stole from her bed and drew aside the blind There was
nothing to be seen but the stars and the dim shape of the hills But
still that song filling the air with its wild triumphant melody

Years afterwards listening to the overture to _Tannhauser_ there came
back to her the memory of that night Ever through the mad Satanic
discords she could hear now faint now conquering the Pilgrims onward
march So through the jangled discords of the world one heard the Song
of Life Through the dim aeons of mans savage infancy through the
centuries of bloodshed and of horror through the dark ages of tyranny
and superstition through wrong through cruelty through hate heedless
of doom heedless of death still the nightingales song I love you I
love you I love you We will build a nest We will rear our brood I
love you I love you Life shall not die

Joan crept back into bed A new wonder had come to her And from that
night Joans belief in Mrs Mundays God began to fade circumstances
helping

Firstly there was the great event of going to school She was glad to
get away from home a massive stiffly furnished house in a wealthy
suburb of Liverpool Her mother since she could remember had been an
invalid rarely leaving her bedroom till the afternoon Her father the
owner of large engineering works she only saw as a rule at
dinnertime when she would come down to dessert It had been different
when she was very young before her mother had been taken ill Then she
had been more with them both She had dim recollections of her father
playing with her pretending to be a bear and growling at her from behind
the sofa And then he would seize and hug her and they would both laugh
while he tossed her into the air and caught her He had looked so big
and handsome All through her childhood there had been the desire to
recreate those days to spring into the air and catch her arms about his
neck She could have loved him dearly if he had only let her Once
seeking explanation she had opened her heart a little to Mrs Munday It
was disappointment Mrs Munday thought that she had not been a boy and
with that Joan had to content herself Maybe also her mothers illness
had helped to sadden him Or perhaps it was mere temperament as she
argued to herself later for which they were both responsible Those
little tricks of coaxing of tenderness of wilfulness by means of which
other girls wriggled their way so successfully into a warm nest of cosy
affection she had never been able to employ them Beneath her
selfconfidence was a shyness an immovable reserve that had always
prevented her from expressing her emotions She had inherited it
doubtless enough from him Perhaps one day between them they would
break down the barrier the strength of which seemed to lie in its very
flimsiness its impalpability

And then during college vacations returning home with growing notions
and views of her own she had found herself so often in antagonism with
him His fierce puritanism so opposed to all her enthusiasms Arguing
with him she might almost have been listening to one of his Cromwellian
ancestors risen from the dead There had been disputes between him and
his workpeople and Joan had taken the side of the men He had not been
angry with her but coldly contemptuous And yet in spite of it all if
he had only made a sign She wanted to fling herself crying into his
arms and shake himmake him listen to her wisdom sitting on his knee
with her hands clasped round his neck He was not really intolerant and
stupid That had been proved by his letting her go to a Church of
England school Her mother had expressed no wish It was he who had
selected it

Of her mother she had always stood somewhat in fear never knowing when
the mood of passionate affection would give place to a chill aversion
that seemed almost like hate Perhaps it had been good for her so she
told herself in after years her lonely unguided childhood It had
forced her to think and act for herself At school she reaped the
benefit Selfreliant confident original leadership was granted to
her as a natural prerogative Nature had helped her Nowhere does a
young girl rule more supremely by reason of her beauty than among her
fellows Joan soon grew accustomed to having her boots put on and taken
off for her all her needs of service anticipated by eager slaves
contending with one another for the privilege By giving a command by
bestowing a few moments of her conversation it was within her power to
make some small adoring girl absurdly happy for the rest of the day
while her displeasure would result in tears in fawning pleadings for
forgiveness The homage did not spoil her Rather it helped to develop
her She accepted it from the beginning as in the order of things Power
had been given to her It was her duty to see to it that she did not use
it capriciously for her own gratification No conscientious youthful
queen could have been more careful in the distribution of her
favoursthat they should be for the encouragement of the deserving the
reward of virtue more sparing of her frowns reserving them for the
rectification of error

At Girton it was more by force of will of brain that she had to make
her position There was more competition Joan welcomed it as giving
more zest to life But even there her beauty was by no means a
negligible quantity Clever brilliant young women accustomed to sweep
aside all opposition with a blaze of rhetoric found themselves to their
irritation sitting in front of her silent not so much listening to her
as looking at her It puzzled them for a time Because a girls
features are classical and her colouring attractive surely that has
nothing to do with the value of her political views Until one of them
discovered by chance that it has

Well what does Beauty think about it this one had asked laughing
She had arrived at the end of a discussion just as Joan was leaving the
room And then she gave a long low whistle feeling that she had
stumbled upon the explanation Beauty that mysterious force that from
the date of creation has ruled the world what does It think Dumb
passive as a rule exercising its influence unconsciously But if it
should become intelligent active A Philosopher has dreamed of the vast
influence that could be exercised by a dozen sincere men acting in unity
Suppose a dozen of the most beautiful women in the world could form
themselves into a league Joan found them late in the evening still
discussing it

Her mother died suddenly during her last term and Joan hurried back to
attend the funeral Her father was out when she reached home Joan
changed her traveldusty clothes and then went into the room where her
mother lay and closed the door She must have been a beautiful woman
Now that the fret and the restlessness had left her it had come back to
her The passionate eyes were closed Joan kissed the marble lids and
drawing a chair to the bedside sat down It grieved her that she had
never loved her mothernot as one ought to love ones mother
unquestioningly unreasoningly as a natural instinct For a moment a
strange thought came to her and swiftly almost guiltily she stole
across and drawing back a corner of the blind examined closely her own
features in the glass comparing them with the face of the dead woman
thus called upon to be a silent witness for or against the living Joan
drew a sigh of relief and let fall the blind There could be no
misreading the evidence Death had smoothed away the lines given back
youth It was almost uncanny the likeness between them It might have
been her drowned sister lying there And they had never known one
another Had this also been temperament again keeping them apart Why
did it imprison us each one as in a moving cell so that we never could
stretch out our arms to one another except when at rare intervals Love
or Death would unlock for a while the key Impossible that two beings
should have been so alike in feature without being more or less alike in
thought and feeling Whose fault had it been Surely her own she was
so hideously calculating Even Mrs Munday because the old lady had
been fond of her and had shown it had been of more service to her more
a companion had been nearer to her than her own mother In selfexcuse
she recalled the two or three occasions when she had tried to win her
mother But fate seemed to have decreed that their moods should never
correspond Her mothers sudden fierce outbursts of love when she would
be jealous exacting almost cruel had frightened her when she was a
child and later on had bored her Other daughters would have shown
patience unselfishness but she had always been so selfcentred Why
had she never fallen in love like other girls There had been a boy at
Brighton when she was at school therequite a nice boy who had written
her wildly extravagant loveletters It must have cost him half his
pocketmoney to get them smuggled in to her Why had she only been
amused at them They might have been beautiful if only one had read them
with sympathy One day he had caught her alone on the Downs Evidently
he had made it his business to hang about every day waiting for some such
chance He had gone down on his knees and kissed her feet and had been
so abject so pitiful that she had given him some flowers she was
wearing And he had sworn to dedicate the rest of his life to being
worthy of her condescension Poor lad She wonderedfor the first time
since that afternoonwhat had become of him There had been others a
third cousin who still wrote to her from Egypt sending her presents that
perhaps he could ill afford and whom she answered about once a year And
promising young men she had met at Cambridge ready she felt
instinctively to fall down and worship her And all the use she had had
for them was to convert them to her viewsa task so easy as to be quite
uninterestingwith a vague idea that they might come in handy in the
future when she might need help in shaping that world of the future

Only once had she ever thought of marriage And that was in favour of a
middleaged rheumatic widower with three children a professor of
chemistry very learned and justly famous For about a month she had
thought herself in love She pictured herself devoting her life to him
rubbing his poor left shoulder where it seemed he suffered most and
brushing his picturesque hair inclined to grey Fortunately his eldest
daughter was a young woman of resource or the poor gentleman naturally
carried off his feet by this adoration of youth and beauty might have
made an ass of himself But apart from this one episode she had reached
the age of twentythree heartwhole

She rose and replaced the chair And suddenly a wave of pity passed over
her for the dead woman who had always seemed so lonely in the great
stifflyfurnished house and the tears came

She was glad she had been able to cry She had always hated herself for
her lack of tears it was so unwomanly Even as a child she had rarely
cried

Her father had always been very tender very patient towards her mother
but she had not expected to find him so changed He had aged and his
shoulders drooped She had been afraid that he would want her to stay
with him and take charge of the house It had worried her considerably
It would be so difficult to refuse and yet she would have to But when
he never broached the subject she was hurt He had questioned her about
her plans the day after the funeral and had seemed only anxious to
assist them She proposed continuing at Cambridge till the end of the
term She had taken her degree the year before After that she would
go to London and commence her work

Let me know what allowance you would like me to make you when you have
thought it out Things are not what they were at the works but there
will always be enough to keep you in comfort he had told her She had
fixed it there and then at two hundred a year She would not take more
and that only until she was in a position to keep herself

I want to prove to myself she explained that I am capable of earning
my own living I am going down into the marketplace If Im no good
if I cant take care of even one poor woman Ill come back and ask you
to keep me She was sitting on the arm of his chair and laughing she
drew his head towards her and pressed it against her If I succeed if
I am strong enough to fight the world for myself and win that will mean
I am strong enough and clever enough to help others

I am only at the end of a journey when you need me he had answered
and they had kissed And next morning she returned to her own life




CHAPTER III


It was at Madge Singletons rooms that the details of Joans entry into
journalistic London were arranged The Coming of Beauty was Flora
Lessings phrase for designating the event Flora Lessing known among
her associates as Flossie was the girl who at Cambridge had
accidentally stumbled upon the explanation of Joans influence In
appearance she was of the Fluffy Ruffles type with childish innocent
eyes and the unruly curls beloved of the _Family Herald_ novelist At
the first these latter had been the result of a habit of late rising and
consequent hurried toilet operations but on the discovery that for the
purposes of her profession they possessed a market value they had been
sedulously cultivated Editors of the old order had ridiculed the idea
of her being of any use to them when two years previously she had by
combination of cheek and patience forced herself into their sanctum had
patted her paternally upon her generally ungloved hand and told her to
go back home and get some honest worthy young man to love and cherish
her

It was Carleton of the _Daily Dispatch_ group who had first divined her
possibilities With a swift glance on his way through he had picked her
out from a line of depressedlooking men and women ranged against the
wall of the dark entrance passage and with a snap of his fingers had
beckoned to her to follow him Striding in front of her up to his room
he had pointed to a chair and had left her sitting there for
threequarters of an hour while he held discussion with a stream of
subordinates managers and editors of departments who entered and
departed one after another evidently in prearranged order All of them
spoke rapidly without ever digressing by a single word from the point
giving her the impression of their speeches having been rehearsed
beforehand

Carleton himself never interrupted them Indeed one might have thought
he was not listening so engrossed he appeared to be in the pile of
letters and telegrams that lay waiting for him on his desk When they
had finished he would ask them questions still with his attention fixed
apparently upon the paper in his hand Then looking up for the first
time he would run off curt instructions much in the tone of a Commander
inChief giving orders for an immediate assault and finishing abruptly
return to his correspondence When the last as it transpired had
closed the door behind him he swung his chair round and faced her

What have you been doing he asked her

Wasting my time and money hanging about newspaper offices listening to
silly talk from old fossils she told him

And having learned that respectable journalism has no use for brains
you come to me he answered her What do you think you can do

Anything that can be done with a pen and ink she told him

Interviewing he suggested

Ive always been considered good at asking awkward questions she
assured him

He glanced at the clock Ill give you five minutes he said
Interview me

She moved to a chair beside the desk and opening her bag took out a
writingblock

What are your principles she asked him Have you got any

He looked at her sharply across the corner of the desk

I mean she continued to what fundamental rule of conduct do you
attribute your success

She leant forward fixing her eyes on him Dont tell me she
persisted that you had none That life is all just mere blind chance
Think of the young men who are hanging on your answer Wont you send
them a message

Yes he answered musingly Its your baby face that does the trick
In the ordinary way I should have known you were pulling my leg and have
shown you the door As it was I felt half inclined for the moment to
reply with some damned silly platitude that would have set all Fleet
Street laughing at me Why do my principles interest you

As a matter of fact they dont she explained But its what people
talk about whenever they discuss you

What do they say he demanded

Your friends that you never had any And your enemies that they are
always the latest she informed him

Youll do he answered with a laugh With nine men out of ten that
speech would have ended your chances You sized me up at a glance and
knew it would only interest me And your instinct is right he added
What people are saying always go straight for that

He gave her a commission then and there for a heart to heart talk with a
gentleman whom the editor of the Home News Department of the _Daily
Dispatch_ would have referred to as a Leading Literary Luminary and
who had just invented a new world in two volumes She had asked him
childish questions and had listened with wideopen eyes while he sitting
over against her and smiling benevolently had laid bare to her all the
seeming intricacies of creation and had explained to her in simple
language the necessary alterations and improvements he was hoping to
bring about in human nature He had the sensation that his hair must be
standing on end the next morning after having read in cold print what he
had said Expanding oneself before the admiring gaze of innocent
simplicity and addressing the easily amused ear of an unsympathetic
public are not the same thing He ought to have thought of that

It consoled him later that he was not the only victim The _Daily
Dispatch_ became famous for its piquant interviews especially with
elderly celebrities of the masculine gender

Its dirty work Flossie confided one day to Madge Singleton I trade
on my silly face Dont see that Im much different to any of these poor
devils They were walking home in the evening from a theatre If I
hadnt been stony broke Id never have taken it up I shall get out of
it as soon as I can afford to

I should make it a bit sooner than that suggested the elder woman
One cant always stop oneself just where one wants to when sliding down
a slope It has a knack of getting steeper and steeper as one goes on

Madge had asked Joan to come a little earlier so that they could have a
chat together before the others arrived

Ive only asked a few she explained as she led Joan into the restful
whitepanelled sittingroom that looked out upon the gardens Madge
shared a set of chambers in Grays Inn with her brother who was an actor
But I have chosen them with care

Joan murmured her thanks

I havent asked any men she added as she fixed Joan in an easy chair
before the fire I was afraid of its introducing the wrong element

Tell me asked Joan am I likely to meet with much of that sort of
thing

Oh about as much as there always is wherever men and women work
together answered Madge Its a nuisance but it has to be faced

Nature appears to have only one idea in her head she continued after a
pause so far as we men and women are concerned Shes been kinder to
the lower animals

Man has more interests Joan argued a thousand other allurements to
distract him we must cultivate his finer instincts

It doesnt seem to answer grumbled Madge One is always told it is
the artistthe brain worker the very men who have these fine instincts
who are the most sexual

She made a little impatient movement with her hands that was
characteristic of her Personally I like men she went on It is so
splendid the way they enjoy life just like a dog does whether its wet
or fine We are always blinking up at the clouds and worrying about our
hat It would be so nice to be able to have friendship with them

I dont mean that its all their fault she continued We do all we
can to attract themthe way we dress Who was it said that to every
woman every man is a potential lover We cant get it out of our minds
Its there even when we dont know it We will never succeed in
civilizing Nature

We wont despair of her laughed Joan Shes creeping up poor lady
as Whistler said of her We have passed the phase when everything she
did was right in our childish eyes Now we dare to criticize her That
shows we are growing up She will learn from us later on Shes a dear
old thing at heart

Shes been kind enough to you replied Madge somewhat irrelevantly
There was a note of irritation in her tone I suppose you know you are
supremely beautiful You seem so indifferent to it I wonder sometimes
if you do

Im not indifferent to it answered Joan Im reckoning on it to help
me

Why not she continued with a flash of defiance though Madge had not
spoken It is a weapon like any otherknowledge intellect courage
God has given me beauty I shall use it in His service

They formed a curious physical contrast these two women in this moment
Joan radiant serene sat upright in her chair her head slightly thrown
back her fine hands clasping one another so strongly that the delicate
muscles could be traced beneath the smooth white skin Madge with
puckered brows leant forward in a crouching attitude her thin nervous
hands stretched out towards the fire

How does one know when one is serving God she asked after a pause
apparently rather of herself than of Joan It seems so difficult

One feels it explained Joan

Yes but didnt they all feel it Madge suggested She still seemed to
be arguing with herself rather than with Joan Nietzsche I have been
reading him They are forming a Nietzsche Society to give lectures about
himpropagate him over here Eleanors in it up to the neck It seems
to me awful Every fibre in my being revolts against him Yet theyre
all cocksure that he is the coming prophet He must have convinced
himself that he is serving God If I were a fighter I should feel I was
serving God trying to down Him How do I know which of us is right
TorquemadaCalvin she went on without giving Joan the chance of a
reply Its easy enough to see they were wrong now But at the time
millions of people believed in themfelt it was Gods voice speaking
through them Joan of Arc Fancy dying to put a thing like that upon a
throne It would be funny if it wasnt so tragic You can say she drove
out the Englishsaved France But for what The Bartholomew massacres
The ruin of the Palatinate by Louis XIV The horrors of the French
Revolution ending with Napoleon and all the misery and degeneracy that
he bequeathed to Europe History might have worked itself out so much
better if the poor child had left it alone and minded her sheep

Wouldnt that train of argument lead to nobody ever doing anything
suggested Joan

I suppose it would mean stagnation admitted Madge And yet I dont
know Are there not forces moving towards right that are crying to us to
help them not by violence which only interruptsdelays them but by
quietly preparing the way for them You know what I mean Erasmus
always said that Luther had hindered the Reformation by stirring up
passion and hate She broke off suddenly There were tears in her
eyes Oh if God would only say what He wants of us she almost cried
call to us in trumpet tones that would ring through the world
compelling us to take sides Why cant He speak

He does answered Joan I hear His voice There are things Ive got
to do Wrongs that I must fight against Rights that I must never dare
to rest till they are won Her lips were parted Her breasts heaving
He does call to us He has girded His sword upon me

Madge looked at her in silence for quite a while How confident you
are she said How I envy you

They talked for a time about domestic matters Joan had established
herself in furnished rooms in a quiet street of pleasant Georgian houses
just behind the Abbey a member of Parliament and his wife occupied the
lower floors the landlord a retired butler and his wife an excellent
cook confining themselves to the basement and the attics The remaining
floor was tenanted by a shy young mana poet so the landlady thought
but was not sure Anyhow he had long hair lived with a pipe in his
mouth and burned his lamp long into the night Joan had omitted to ask
his name She made a note to do so

They discussed ways and means Joan calculated she could get through on
two hundred a year putting aside fifty for dress Madge was doubtful if
this would be sufficient Joan urged that she was stock size and would
be able to pick up models at sales but Madge measuring her against
herself was sure she was too full

You will find yourself expensive to dress she told her cheap things
wont go well on you and it would be madness even from a business point
of view for you not to make the best of yourself

Men stand more in awe of a welldressed woman than they do even of a
beautiful woman Madge was of opinion If you go into an office
looking dowdy theyll beat you down Tell them the price they are
offering you wont keep you in gloves for a week and theyll be ashamed
of themselves Theres nothing _infra dig_ in being mean to the poor
but not to sympathize with the rich stamps you as middle class She
laughed

Joan was worried I told Dad I should only ask him for enough to make
up two hundred a year she explained Hell laugh at me for not
knowing my own mind

I should let him advised Madge She grew thoughtful again We
cranky young women with our newfangled independent ways I guess we
hurt the old folks quite enough as it is

The bell rang and Madge opened the door herself It turned out to be
Flossie Joan had not seen her since they had been at Girton together
and was surprised at Flossies youthful get up Flossie explained and
without waiting for any possible attack flew to her own defence

The revolution that the world is waiting for was Flossies opinion
is the providing of every man and woman with a hundred and fifty a year
Then we shall all be able to afford to be noble and highminded As it
is ninetenths of the contemptible things we do comes from the necessity
of our having to earn our living A hundred and fifty a year would
deliver us from evil

Would there not still be the diamond dogcollar and the motor car left
to tempt us suggested Madge

Only the really wicked contended Flossie It would classify us We
should know then which were the sheep and which the goats At present
were all jumbled together the ungodly who sin out of mere greed and
rapacity and the just men compelled to sell their birthright of fine
instincts for a mess of meat and potatoes

Yah socialist commented Madge who was busy with the tea things

Flossie seemed struck by an idea

By Jove she exclaimed Why did I never think of it With a red flag
and my hair down Id be in all the illustrated papers It would put up
my price no end And Id be able to get out of this silly job of mine I
cant go on much longer Im getting too well known I do believe Ill
try it The shoutings easy enough She turned to Joan Are you
going to take up socialism she demanded

I may answered Joan Just to spank it and put it down again Im
rather a believer in temptationthe struggle for existence I only want
to make it a finer existence more worth the struggle in which the best
man shall rise to the top Your universal securitythat will be the
last act of the human drama the cue for ringing down the curtain

But do not all our Isms work towards that end suggested Madge

Joan was about to reply when the maids announcement of Mrs Denton
postponed the discussion

Mrs Denton was a short greyhaired lady Her large strong features
must have made her when she was young a hardlooking woman but time
and sorrow had strangely softened them while about the corners of the
thin firm mouth lurked a suggestion of humour that possibly had not
always been there Joan waiting to be introduced towered head and
shoulders above her yet when she took the small proffered hand and felt
those steely blue eyes surveying her she had the sensation of being
quite insignificant Mrs Denton seemed to be reading her and then
still retaining Joans hand she turned to Madge with a smile

So this is our new recruit she said She is come to bring healing to
the sad sick worldto right all the old old wrongs

She patted Joans hand and spoke gravely That is right dear That is
youths _metier_ to take the banner from our failing hands bear it
still a little onward Her small gloved hand closed on Joans with a
pressure that made Joan wince

And you must not despair she continued because in the end it will
seem to you that you have failed It is the fallen that win the
victories

She released Joans hand abruptly Come and see me tomorrow morning at
my office she said We will fix up something that shall be
serviceable to us both

Madge flashed Joan a look She considered Joans position already
secured Mrs Denton was the doyen of women journalists She edited a
monthly review and was leader writer of one of the most important
dailies besides being the controlling spirit of various social
movements Anyone she took up would be assured of steady work The
pay might not be able to compete with the prices paid for more popular
journalism but it would afford a foundation and give to Joan that
opportunity for influence which was her main ambition

Joan expressed her thanks She would like to have had more talk with the
stern old lady but was prevented by the entrance of two new comers The
first was Miss Lavery a handsome loudtoned young woman She ran a
nursing paper but her chief interest was in the womans suffrage
question just then coming rapidly to the front She had heard Joan
speak at Cambridge and was eager to secure her adherence being wishful
to surround herself with a group of young and goodlooking women who
should take the movement out of the hands of the frumps as she termed
them Her doubt was whether Joan would prove sufficiently tractable She
intended to offer her remunerative work upon the _Nursing News_ without
saying anything about the real motive behind trusting to gratitude to
make her task the easier

The second was a clumsylooking overdressed woman whom Miss Lavery
introduced as Mrs Phillips a very dear friend of mine who is going to
be helpful to us all adding in a hurried aside to Madge I simply had
to bring her Will explain to you another time An apology certainly
seemed to be needed The woman was absurdly out of her place She stood
there panting and slightly perspiring She was short and fat with dyed
hair As a girl she had possibly been pretty in a dimpled giggling sort
of way Joan judged her in spite of her complexion to be about forty

Joan wondered if she could be the wife of the Member of Parliament who
occupied the rooms below her in Cowley Street His name so the landlady
had told her was Phillips She put the suggestion in a whisper to
Flossie

Quite likely thought Flossie just the type that sort of man does
marry A barmaid I expect

Others continued to arrive until altogether there must have been about a
dozen women present One of them turned out to be an old schoolfellow of
Joans and two had been with her at Girton Madge had selected those who
she knew would be sympathetic and all promised help those who could not
give it direct undertaking to provide introductions and recommendations
though some of them were frankly doubtful of journalism affording Joan
anything more than the meansnot always too honestof earning a
living

I started out to preach the gospel all that sort of thing drawled a
Miss Simmonds from beneath a hat that if she had paid for it would have
cost her five guineas Now my chief purpose in life is to tickle silly
women into spending twice as much upon their clothes as their husbands
can afford bamboozling them into buying any old thing that our
Advertising Manager instructs me to boom

They talk about the editors opinions struck in a fiery little woman
who was busy flinging crumbs out of the window to a crowd of noisy
sparrows Its the Advertiser edits half the papers Write anything
that three of them object to and your proprietor tells you to change
your convictions or go Most of us change She jerked down the window
with a slam

Its the syndicates that have done it was a Mrs Elliots opinion She
wrote Society Notes for a Labour weekly When one man owned a paper
he wanted it to express his views A company is only out for profit
Your modern newspaper is just a shop Its only purpose is to attract
customers Look at the _Methodist Herald_ owned by the same syndicate
of Jews that runs the _Racing News_ They work it as far as possible
with the same staff

Were a pack of hirelings asserted the fiery little woman Our pens
are for sale to the highest bidder I had a letter from Jocelyn only two
days ago He was one of the original staff of the _Socialist_ He
writes me that he has gone as leader writer to a Conservative paper at
twice his former salary Expected me to congratulate him

One of these days somebody will start a Society for the Reformation of
the Press thought Flossie I wonder how the papers will take it

Much as Rome took Savonarola thought Madge

Mrs Denton had risen

They are right to a great extent she said to Joan But not all the
temple has been given over to the hucksters You shall place your
preaching stool in some quiet corner where the passing feet shall pause
awhile to listen

Her going was the signal for the breaking up of the party In a short
time Joan and Madge found themselves left with only Flossie

What on earth induced Helen to bring that poor old Dutch doll along with
her demanded Flossie The woman never opened her mouth all the time
Did she tell you

No answered Madge but I think I can guess She hopesor perhaps
fears would be more correctthat her husband is going to join the
Cabinet and is trying to fit herself by suddenly studying political and
social questions For a month shes been clinging like a leech to Helen
Lavery who takes her to meetings and gatherings I suppose theyve
struck up some sort of a bargain Its rather pathetic

Good Heavens What a tragedy for the man commented Flossie

What is he like asked Joan

Not much to look at if thats what you mean answered Madge Began
life as a miner I believe Looks like ending as Prime Minister

I heard him at the Albert Hall last week said Flossie Hes quite
wonderful

In what way questioned Joan

Oh you know explained Flossie Like a volcano compressed into a
steam engine

They discussed Joans plans It looked as if things were going to be
easy for her




CHAPTER IV


Yet in the end it was Carleton who opened the door for her

Mrs Denton was helpful and would have been more so if Joan had only
understood Mrs Denton lived alone in an old house in Gower Street
with a high stone hall that was always echoing to sounds that no one but
itself could ever hear Her son had settled it was supposed in one of
the Colonies No one knew what had become of him and Mrs Denton
herself never spoke of him while her daughter on whom she had centred
all her remaining hopes had died years ago To those who remembered the
girl with her weak eyes and wispy ginger coloured hair it would have
seemed comical the idea that Joan resembled her But Mrs Dentons
memory had lost itself in dreams and to her the likeness had appeared
quite wonderful The gods had given her child back to her grown strong
and brave and clever Life would have a new meaning for her Her work
would not die with her

She thought she could harness Joans enthusiasm to her own wisdom She
would warn her of the errors and pitfalls into which she herself had
fallen for she too had started as a rebel Youth should begin where
age left off Had the old lady remembered a faded dogseared volume
labelled Oddments that for many years had rested undisturbed upon its
shelf in her great library and opening it had turned to the letter E
she would have read recorded there in her own precise thin penmanship
this very wise reflection

Experience is a book that all men write but no man reads

To which she would have found added by way of complement Experience is
untranslatable We write it in the cipher of our sufferings and the key
is hidden in our memories

And turning to the letter Y she might have read

Youth comes to teach Age remains to listen and underneath the
following

The ability to learn is the last lesson we acquire

Mrs Denton had long ago given up the practice of jotting down her
thoughts experience having taught her that so often when one comes to
use them one finds that one has changed them But in the case of Joan
the recollection of these twin oddments might have saved her
disappointment Joan knew of a new road that avoided Mrs Dentons
pitfalls She grew impatient of being perpetually pulled back

For the _Nursing Times_ she wrote a series of condensed biographies
entitled Ladies of the Lamp commencing with Elizabeth Fry They
formed a record of good women who had battled for the weak and suffering
winning justice for even the uninteresting Miss Lavery was delighted
with them But when Joan proposed exposing the neglect and even cruelty
too often inflicted upon the helpless patients of private Nursing Homes
Miss Lavery shook her head

I know she said One does hear complaints about them Unfortunately
it is one of the few businesses managed entirely by women and just now
in particular if we were to say anything it would be made use of by our
enemies to injure the Cause

There was a summer years agoit came back to Joans mindwhen she had
shared lodgings with a girl chum at a crowded seaside wateringplace
The rooms were shockingly dirty and tired of dropping hints she
determined one morning to clean them herself She climbed a chair and
started on a row of shelves where lay the dust of ages It was a jerry
built house and the result was that she brought the whole lot down about
her head together with a quarter of a hundredweight of plaster

Yes I thought youd do some mischief had commented the landlady
wearily

It seemed typical A jerrybuilt world apparently With the best
intentions it seemed impossible to move in it without doing more harm
than good to it bringing things down about one that one had not
intended

She wanted to abolish steel rabbittraps She had heard the little
beggars cry It had struck her as such a harmless reform But they told
her there were worthy people in the neighbourhood of Wolverhamptonquite
a number of themwho made their living by the manufacture of steel
rabbittraps If thinking only of the rabbits you prohibited steel
rabbittraps then you condemned all these worthy people to slow
starvation The local Mayor himself wrote in answer to her article He
drew a moving picture of the sad results that might follow such an ill
considered agitation hundreds of greyhaired men too old to learn new
jobs begging from door to door shoals of little children whitefaced
and pinched sobbing women Her editor was sorry for the rabbits Had
often spent a pleasant day with them himself But after all the Human
Race claimed our first sympathies

She wanted to abolish sweating She had climbed the rotting stairways
seen the famished creatures in their holes But it seemed that if you
interfered with the complicated system based on sweating then you
dislocated the entire structure of the British export clothing trade Not
only would these poor creatures lose their admittedly wretched livingbut
still a livingbut thousands of other innocent victims would also be
involved in the common ruin All very sad but half a loafor even let
us frankly say a thin sliceis better than no bread at all

She wanted board school childrens heads examined She had examined one
or two herself It seemed to her wrong that healthy children should be
compelled to sit for hours within jumping distance of the diseased She
thought it better that the dirty should be made fit company for the clean
than the clean should be brought down to the level of the dirty It
seemed that in doing this you were destroying the independence of the
poor Opposition reformers in letters scintillating with paradox
bristling with classical allusion denounced her attempt to impose middle
class ideals upon a too long suffering proletariat Better far a few
lively little heads than a brokenspirited people robbed of their
parental rights

Through Miss Lavery she obtained an introduction to the great Sir
William He owned a group of popular provincial newspapers and was most
encouraging Sir William had often said to himself

What can I do for God who has done so much for me It seemed only
fair

He asked her down to his little place in Hampshire to talk plans over
The little place it turned out ran to forty bedrooms and was
surrounded by three hundred acres of park God had evidently done his
bit quite handsomely

It was in a secluded corner of the park that Sir William had gone down
upon one knee and gallantly kissed her hand His idea was that if she
could regard herself as his Dear Lady and allow him the honour and
privilege of being her True Knight that between them they might
accomplish something really useful There had been some difficulty about
his getting up again Sir William being an elderly gentleman subject to
rheumatism and Joan had had to expend no small amount of muscular effort
in assisting him so that the episode which should have been symbolical
ended by leaving them both red and breathless

He referred to the matter again the same evening in the library while
Lady William slept peacefully in the blue drawingroom but as it
appeared necessary that the compact should be sealed by a knightly kiss
Joan had failed to ratify it

She blamed herself on her way home The poor old gentleman could easily
have been kept in his place The suffering of an occasional harmless
caress would have purchased for her power and opportunity Had it not
been somewhat selfish of her Should she write to himsee him again

She knew that she never would It was something apart from her reason
It would not even listen to her It bade or forbade as if one were a
child without any right to a will of ones own It was decidedly
exasperating

There were others There were the editors who frankly told her that the
business of a newspaper was to write what its customers wanted to read
and that the public so far as they could judge was just about fed up
with plans for New Jerusalems at their expense And the editors who were
prepared to take up any number of reforms insisting only that they
should be new and original and promise popularity

And then she met Greyson

It was at a lunch given by Mrs Denton Greyson was a bachelor and lived
with an unmarried sister a few years older than himself He was editor
and part proprietor of an evening paper It had ideals and was in
consequence regarded by the general public with suspicion but by reason
of sincerity and braininess was rapidly becoming a power He was a shy
reserved man with an aristocratic head set upon stooping shoulders The
face was that of a dreamer but about the mouth there was suggestion of
the fighter Joan felt at her ease with him in spite of the air of
detachment that seemed part of his character Mrs Denton had paired
them off together and during the lunch one of themJoan could not
remember whichhad introduced the subject of reincarnation

Greyson was unable to accept the theory because of the fact that in old
age the mind in common with the body is subject to decay

Perhaps by the time I am fortyor let us say fifty he argued I
shall be a bright intelligent being If I die then well and good I
select a likely baby and go straight on But suppose I hang about till
eighty and die a childish old gentleman with a mind all gone to seed
What am I going to do then I shall have to begin all over again
perhaps worse off than I was before Thats not going to help us much

Joan explained it to him that old age might be likened to an illness A
genius lies upon a bed of sickness and babbles childish nonsense But
with returning life he regains his power goes on increasing it The
mind the soul has not decayed It is the lines of communication that
old age has destroyed

But surely you dont believe it he demanded

Why not laughed Joan All things are possible It was the
possession of a hand that transformed monkeys into men We used to take
things up you know and look at them and wonder and wonder and wonder
till at last there was born a thought and the world became visible It
is curiosity that will lead us to the next great discovery We must take
things up and think and think and think till one day there will come
knowledge and we shall see the universe

Joan always avoided getting excited when she thought of it

I love to make you excited Flossie had once confessed to her in the
old student days You look so ridiculously young and you are so pleased
with yourself laying down the law

She did not know she had given way to it He was leaning back in his
chair looking at her and the tired look she had noticed in his eyes
when she had been introduced to him in the drawingroom had gone out of
them

During the coffee Mrs Denton beckoned him to come to her and Miss
Greyson crossed over and took his vacant chair She had been sitting
opposite to them

Ive been hearing so much about you she said I cant help thinking
that you ought to suit my brothers paper He has all your ideas Have
you anything that you could send him

Joan considered a moment

Nothing very startling she answered I was thinking of a series of
articles on the old London Churchestouching upon the people connected
with them and the things they stood for Ive just finished the first
one

It ought to be the very thing answered Miss Greyson She was a thin
faded woman with a soft plaintive voice It will enable him to judge
your style Hes particular about that Though Im confident hell like
it she hastened to add Address it to me will you I assist him as
much as I can

Joan added a few finishing touches that evening and posted it and a day
or two later received a note asking her to call at the office

My sister is enthusiastic about your article on Chelsea Church and
insists on my taking the whole series Greyson informed her She says
you have the Stevensonian touch

Joan flushed with pleasure

And you she asked did you think it had the Stevensonian touch

No he answered it seemed to me to have more of your touch

Whats that like she demanded

They couldnt suppress you he explained Sir Thomas More with his
head under his arm bloody old Bluebeard grim Queen Bess snarling old
Swift Pope Addison Carlylethe whole grisly crowd of them I could
see you holding your own against them all explaining things to them
getting excited He laughed

His sister joined them coming in from the next room She had a proposal
to make It was that Joan should take over the weekly letter from
Clorinda It was supposed to give the views of aperhaps
unusuallysane and thoughtful woman upon the questions of the day Miss
Greyson had hitherto conducted it herself but was wishful as she
explained to be relieved of it so that she might have more time for home
affairs It would necessitate Joans frequent attendance at the office
for there would be letters from the public to be answered and points to
be discussed with her brother She was standing behind his chair with
her hands upon his head There was something strangely motherly about
her whole attitude

Greyson was surprised for the Letter had been her own conception and
had grown into a popular feature But she was evidently in earnest and
Joan accepted willingly Clorinda grew younger more selfassertive
on the whole more human But still so eminently sane and reasonable

We must not forget that she is quite a respectable lady
connectedaccording to her own accountwith the higher political
circles Joans editor would insist with a laugh

Miss Greyson working in the adjoining room would raise her head and
listen She loved to hear him laugh

Its absurd Flossie told her one morning as having met by chance they
were walking home together along the Embankment Youre not Clorinda
you ought to be writing letters to her not from her waking her up
telling her to come off her perch and find out what the earth feels
like Ill tell you what Ill do Ill trot you round to Carleton If
youre out for stirring up strife and contention well thats his game
too Hell use you for his beastly sordid ends Hed have roped in John
the Baptist if hed been running the Jerusalem Star at the time and
have given him a daily column for so long as the boom lasted Whats
that matter if hes willing to give you a start

Joan jibbed at first But in the end Flossies arguments prevailed One
afternoon a week later she was shown into Carletons private room and
the door closed behind her The light was dim and for a moment she
could see no one until Carleton who had been standing near one of the
windows came forward and placed a chair for her And they both sat
down

Ive glanced through some of your things he said Theyre all right
Theyre alive Whats your idea

Remembering Flossies counsel she went straight to the point She
wanted to talk to the people She wanted to get at them If she had
been a man she would have taken a chair and gone to Hyde Park As it
was she hadnt the nerve for Hyde Park At least she was afraid she
hadnt It might have to come to that There was a trembling in her
voice that annoyed her She was so afraid she might cry She wasnt out
for anything crazy She wanted only those things done that could be done
if the people would but lift their eyes look into one anothers faces
see the wrong and the injustice that was all around them and swear that
they would never rest till the pain and the terror had been driven from
the land She wanted soldiersmen and women who would forget their own
sweet selves not counting their own loss thinking of the greater gain
as in times of war and revolution when men gave even their lives gladly
for a dream for a hope

Without warning he switched on the electric lamp that stood upon the
desk causing her to draw back with a start

All right he said Go ahead You shall have your tub and a weekly
audience of a million readers for as long as you can keep them
interested Up with anything you like and down with everything you
dont Be careful not to land me in a libel suit Call the whole Bench
of Bishops hypocrites and all the ground landlords thieves if you will
but dont mention names And dont get me into trouble with the police
Beyond that I shant interfere with you

She was about to speak

One stipulation he went on that every article is headed with your
photograph

He read the sudden dismay in her eyes

How else do you think you are going to attract their attention he
asked her By your eloquence Hundreds of men and women as eloquent as
you could ever be are shouting to them every day Who takes any notice
of them Why should they listen any the more to youanother cranky
highbrow some old maid most likely with a bony throat and a beaky
nose If Woman is going to come into the fight she will have to use her
own weapons If she is prepared to do that shell make things hum with a
vengeance Shes the biggest force going if she only knew it

He had risen and was pacing the room

The advertiser has found that out and is showing the way He snatched
at an illustrated magazine fresh from the press that had been placed
upon his desk and opened it at the first page Johnsons Blacking he
read out advertised by a dainty little minx showing her ankles Whos
going to stop for a moment to read about somebodys blacking If a saucy
little minx isnt there to trip him up with her ankles

He turned another page Do you suffer from gout Classical lady
preparing to take a bath and very nearly ready The old Johnny in the
train stops to look at her Reads the advertisement because she seems to
want him to Rubber heels Save your boot leather Lady in evening
dressjolly pretty shoulderswaves them in front of your eyes
Otherwise youd never think of them

He fluttered the pages Then flung the thing across to her

Look at it he said Fountain pensCorn plastersCharitable
appealsMotor carsSoapsGrand pianos Its the girl in tights and
spangles outside the show that brings them trooping in

Let them see you he continued You say you want soldiers Throw off
your veil and call for them Your namesake of France Do you think if
she had contented herself with writing stirring appeals that Orleans
would have fallen She put on a becoming suit of armour and got upon a
horse where everyone could see her Chivalry isnt dead You modern
women are ashamed of yourselvesashamed of your sex You dont give it
a chance Revive it Stir the young mens blood Their souls will
follow

He reseated himself and leant across towards her

Im not talking business he said This things not going to mean
much to me one way or the other I want you to win Farm labourers
bringing up families on twelve and six a week Shirt hands working half
into the night for three farthings an hour Stinking dens for men to
live in Degraded women Half fed children Its damnable Tell them
its got to stop That the Eternal Feminine has stepped out of the
poster and commands it

A dapper young man opened the door and put his head into the room

Railway smash in Yorkshire he announced

Carleton sat up Much of a one he asked

The dapper gentleman shrugged his shoulders Three killed eight
injured so far he answered

Carletons interest appeared to collapse

Stop press column asked the dapper gentleman

Yes I suppose so replied Carleton Unless something better turns
up

The dapper young gentleman disappeared Joan had risen

May I talk it over with a friend she asked Myself Im inclined to
accept

You will if youre in earnest he answered Ill give you twenty
four hours Look in tomorrow afternoon and see Finch It will be for
the _Sunday Post_the Inset We use surfaced paper for that and can do
you justice Finch will arrange about the photograph He held out his
hand Shall be seeing you again he said

It was but a stones throw to the office of the _Evening Gazette_ She
caught Greyson just as he was leaving and put the thing before him His
sister was with him

He did not answer at first He was walking to and fro and catching his
foot in the waste paper basket he kicked it savagely out of his way so
that the contents were scattered over the room

Yes hes right he said It was the Virgin above the altar that
popularized Christianity Her face has always been womans fortune If
shes going to become a fighter it will have to be her weapon

He had used almost the same words that Carleton had used

I so want them to listen to me she said After all its only like
having a very loud voice

He looked at her and smiled Yes he said its a voice men will
listen to

Mary Greyson was standing by the fire She had not spoken hitherto

You wont give up Clorinda she asked

Joan had intended to do so but something in Marys voice caused her
against her will to change her mind

Of course not she answered I shall run them both It will be like
writing Jekyll and Hyde

What will you sign yourself he asked

My own name I think she said Joan Allway

Miss Greyson suggested her coming home to dinner with them but Joan
found an excuse She wanted to be alone




CHAPTER V


The twilight was fading as she left the office She turned northward
choosing a broad illlighted road It did not matter which way she
took She wanted to think or rather to dream

It would all fall out as she had intended She would commence by
becoming a power in journalism She was reconciled now to the photograph
ideawas even keen on it herself She would be taken full face so that
she would be looking straight into the eyes of her readers as she talked
to them It would compel her to be herself just a hopeful loving
woman a little better educated than the majority having had greater
opportunity a little further seeing maybe having had more leisure for
thought but otherwise no whit superior to any other young eager woman
of the people This absurd journalistic pose of omniscience of
infallibilitythis nonexistent garment of supreme wisdom that like the
Kings clothes in the fairy story was donned to hide his nakedness by
every strutting nonentity of Fleet Street She would have no use for it
It should be a friend a comrade a fellowservant of the great Master
taking counsel with them asking their help Government by the people
for the people It must be made real These silent thoughtfullooking
workers hurrying homewards through the darkening streets these patient
shrewdplanning housewives casting their shadows on the drawndown
blinds it was they who should be shaping the world not the journalists
to whom all life was but so much copy This monstrous conspiracy once
of the Sword of the Church now of the Press that put all Government
into the hands of a few stuffy old gentlemen politicians leader
writers without sympathy or understanding it was time that it was swept
away She would raise a new standard It should be not Listen to me
oh ye dumb but Speak to me Tell me your hidden hopes your fears
your dreams Tell me your experience your thoughts born of knowledge
of suffering

She would get into correspondence with them go among them talk to them
The difficulty at first would be in getting them to write to her to
open their minds to her These voiceless masses that never spoke but
were always being spoken for by selfappointed leaders
representatives who immediately they had climbed into prominence took
their place among the rulers and then from press and platform shouted to
them what they were to think and feel It was as if the DrillSergeant
were to claim to be the leader the representative of his squad or
the sheepdog to pose as the delegate of the sheep Dealt with always
as if they were mere herds mere flocks they had almost lost the power
of individual utterance One would have to teach them encourage them

She remembered a Sunday class she had once conducted and how for a long
time she had tried in vain to get the children to come in to take a
hand That she might get in touch with them understand their small
problems she had urged them to ask questions And there had fallen such
long silences Until at last one cheeky ragamuffin had piped out

Please Miss have you got red hair all over you Or only on your
head

For answer she had rolled up her sleeve and let them examine her arm
And then in her turn had insisted on rolling up his sleeve revealing
the fact that his arms above the wrists had evidently not too recently
been washed and the episode had ended in laughter and a babel of shrill
voices And at once they were a party of chums discussing matters
together

They were but children these tired men and women just released from
their days toil hastening homeward to their play or to their evening
tasks A little humour a little understanding a recognition of the
wonderful likeness of us all to one another underneath our outward
coverings was all that was needed to break down the barrier establish
comradeship She stood aside a moment to watch them streaming by Keen
strong faces were among them high thoughtful brows kind eyes they
must learn to think to speak for themselves

She would build again the Forum The peoples business should no longer
be settled for them behind lackeyguarded doors The good of the farm
labourer should be determined not exclusively by the squire and his
relations The man with the hoe the man with the bent back and the
patient oxlike eyes he too should be invited to the Council board
Middleclass domestic problems should be solved not solely by fine
gentlemen from Oxford the wife of the little clerk should be allowed her
say War or peace it should no longer be regarded as a question
concerning only the aged rich The common peoplethe cannon fodder the
men who would die and the women who would weep they should be given
something more than the privilege of either cheering platform patriots or
being summoned for interrupting public meetings

From a dismal side street there darted past her a small shapeless figure
in crumpled cap and apron evidently a member of that lazy overindulged
class the domestic servant Judging from the talk of the drawingrooms
the correspondence in the papers a singularly unsatisfactory body They
toiled not lived in luxury and demanded grand pianos Someone had
proposed doing something for them They themselvesit seemed that even
they had a sort of consciencewere up in arms against it Too much
kindness even they themselves perceived was bad for them They were
holding a meeting that night to explain how contented they were Six
peeresses had consented to attend and speak for them

Likely enough that there were goodfornothing cockered menials imposing
upon incompetent mistresses There were pampered slaves in Rome But
these others These poor little helpless sluts There were thousands
such in every city overworked and underfed living lonely
pleasureless lives They must be taught to speak in other voices than
the dulcet tones of peeresses By the light of the guttering candles
from their chill attics they should write to her their illspelt
visions

She had reached a quiet treebordered road surrounding a great park
Lovers furtively holding hands passed her by whispering

She would write books She would choose for her heroine a woman of the
people How full of drama of tragedy must be their stories their
problems the grim realities of life not only its mere sentimental
embroideries The daily struggle for bare existence the evershadowing
menace of unemployment of illness leaving them helpless amid the
grinding forces crushing them down on every side The ceaseless need for
courage for cunning For in the kingdom of the poor the tyrant and the
oppressor still sit in the high places the robber still rides fearless

In a noisy flaring street a thinclad woman passed her carrying a
netted bag showing two loaves In a flash it came to her what it must
mean to the poor this daily bread that in comfortable homes had come to
be regarded as a thing like water not to be considered to be used
without stint wasted thrown about Borne by those feeble knotted
hands Joan saw it revealed as something holy hallowed by labour
sanctified by suffering by sacrifice worshipped with fear and prayer

In quiet streets of stately houses she caught glimpses through
uncurtained windows of richlylaid dinnertables about which servants
moved noiselessly arranging flowers and silver She wondered idly if
she would every marry A gracious hostess gathering around her
brilliant men and women statesmen writers artists captains of
industry counselling them even learning from them encouraging shy
genius Perhaps in a perfectly harmless way allowing it the
inspiration derivable from a wellregulated devotion to herself A salon
that should be the nucleus of all those forces that influence influences
over which she would rule with sweet and wise authority The idea
appealed to her

Into the picture slightly to the background she unconsciously placed
Greyson His tall thin figure with its air of distinction seemed to fit
in Greyson would be very restful She could see his handsome ascetic
face flush with pleasure as after the guests were gone she would lean
over the back of his chair and caress for a moment his dark soft hair
tinged here and there with grey He would always adore her in that
distant undemonstrative way of his that would never be tiresome or
exacting They would have children But not too many That would make
the house noisy and distract her from her work They would be beautiful
and clever unless all the laws of heredity were to be set aside for her
especial injury She would train them shape them to be the heirs of her
labour bearing her message to the generations that should follow

At a corner where the trams and buses stopped she lingered for a while
watching the fierce struggle the weak and aged being pushed back time
after time hardly seeming to even resent it regarding it as in the
natural order of things It was so absurd apart from the injustice the
brutality of it The poor fighting among themselves She felt as once
when watching a crowd of birds to whom she had thrown a handful of crumbs
in winter time As if they had not enemies enough cats weasels rats
hawks owls the hunger and the cold And added to all they must needs
make the struggle yet harder for one another pecking at each others
eyes joining with one another to attack the fallen These tired men
these weary women palefaced lads and girls why did they not organize
among themselves some system that would do away with this daily warfare
of each against all If only they could be got to grasp the fact that
they were one family bound together by suffering Then and not till
then would they be able to make their power felt That would have to
come first the _Esprit de Corps_ of the Poor

In the end she would go into Parliament It would be bound to come soon
the womans vote And after that the opening of all doors would follow
She would wear her college robes It would be far more fitting than a
succession of flimsy frocks that would have no meaning in them What
pity it was that the art of dressingits relation to lifewas not
better understood What beautyhating devil had prompted the workers to
discard their characteristic costumes that had been both beautiful and
serviceable for these hateful slopshop clothes that made them look like
walking scarecrows Why had the coming of Democracy coincided seemingly
with the spread of ugliness dull towns mean streets paperstrewn
parks corrugated iron roofs Christian chapels that would be an insult
to a heathen idol hideous factories Why need they be hideous chimney
pot hats baggy trousers vulgar advertisements stupid fashions for
women that spoilt every line of their figure dinginess drabness
monotony everywhere It was ugliness that was strangling the soul of the
people stealing from them all dignity all selfrespect all honour for
one another robbing them of hope of reverence of joy in life

Beauty That was the key to the riddle All Nature its golden sunsets
and its silvery dawns the glory of piledup clouds the mystery of
moonlit glades its rivers winding through the meadows the calling of
its restless seas the tender witchery of Spring the blazonry of autumn
woods its purple moors and the wonder of its silent mountains its
cobwebs glittering with a thousand jewels the pageantry of starry
nights Form colour music The feathered choristers of bush and brake
raising their matin and their evensong the whispering of the leaves the
singing of the waters the voices of the winds Beauty and grace in
every living thing but man The leaping of the hares the grouping of
cattle the flight of swallows the dainty loveliness of insects wings
the glossy skin of horses rising and falling to the play of mighty
muscles Was it not seeking to make plain to us that Gods language was
beauty Man must learn beauty that he may understand God

She saw the London of the future Not the vision popular just then a
soaring whirl of machinery in motion of moving pavements and flying
omnibuses of screaming gramophones and standardized homes a city
where Electricity was King and man its soulless slave But a city of
peace of restful spaces of leisured men and women a city of fine
streets and pleasant houses where each could live his own life learning
freedom individuality a city of noble schools of workshops that should
be worthy of labour filled with light and air smoke and filth driven
from the land science no longer bound to commercialism having
discovered cleaner forces a city of gay playgrounds where children
should learn laughter of leafy walks where the creatures of the wood and
field should be as welcome guests helping to teach sympathy and
kindliness a city of music of colour of gladness Beauty worshipped
as religion ugliness banished as a sin no ugly slums no ugly cruelty
no slatternly women and brutalized men no ugly sobbing children no
ugly vice flaunting in every highway its insult to humanity a city clad
in beauty as with a living garment where God should walk with man

She had reached a neighbourhood of narrow crowded streets The women
were mostly without hats and swarthy men rolling cigarettes lounged
against doorways The place had a quaint foreign flavour Tiny cafes
filled with smoke and noise and clean inviting restaurants abounded
She was feeling hungry and choosing one the door of which stood open
revealing white tablecloths and a pleasant air of cheerfulness she
entered It was late and the tables were crowded Only at one in a far
corner could she detect a vacant place opposite to a slight pretty
looking girl very quietly dressed She made her way across and the girl
anticipating her request welcomed her with a smile They ate for a
while in silence divided only by the narrow table their heads when
they leant forward almost touching Joan noticed the short white
hands the fragrance of some delicate scent There was something odd
about her She seemed to be unnecessarily conscious of being alone
Suddenly she spoke

Nice little restaurant this she said One of the few places where
you can depend upon not being annoyed

Joan did not understand In what way she asked

Oh you know men answered the girl They come and sit down opposite
to you and wont leave you alone At most of the places youve got to
put up with it or go outside Here old Gustav never permits it

Joan was troubled She was rather looking forward to occasional
restaurant dinners where she would be able to study Londons Bohemia

You mean she asked that they force themselves upon you even if you
make it plain

Oh the plainer you make it that you dont want them the more sport
they think it interrupted the girl with a laugh

Joan hoped she was exaggerating I must try and select a table where
there is some goodnatured girl to keep me in countenance she said with
a smile

Yes I was glad to see you answered the girl Its hateful dining
by oneself Are you living alone

Yes answered Joan Im a journalist

I thought you were something answered the girl Im an artist Or
rather was she added after a pause

Why did you give it up asked Joan

Oh I havent given it up not entirely the girl answered I can
always get a couple of sovereigns for a sketch if I want it from one or
another of the framemakers And they can generally sell them for a
fiver Ive seen them marked up Have you been long in London

No answered Joan Im a Lancashire lass

Curious said the girl so am I My fathers a mill manager near
Bolton You werent educated there

No Joan admitted I went to Rodean at Brighton when I was ten years
old and so escaped it Nor were you she added with a smile judging
from your accent

No answered the other I was at HastingsMiss Gwyns Funny how we
seem to have always been near to one another Dad wanted me to be a
doctor But Id always been mad about art

Joan had taken a liking to the girl It was a spiritual vivacious face
with frank eyes and a firm mouth and the voice was low and strong

Tell me she said what interfered with it Unconsciously she was
leaning forward her chin supported by her hands Their faces were very
near to one another

The girl looked up She did not answer for a moment There came a
hardening of the mouth before she spoke

A baby she said Oh it was my own fault she continued I wanted
it It was all the talk at the time You dont remember Our right to
children No woman complete without one Maternity womans kingdom
All that sort of thing As if the storks brought them Dont suppose it
made any real difference but it just helped me to pretend that it was
something pretty and highclass Overmastering passion used to be the
explanation before that I guess its all much of a muchness just
natural instinct

The restaurant had been steadily emptying Monsieur Gustav and his ample
bosomed wife were seated at a distant table eating their own dinner

Why couldnt you have married asked Joan

The girl shrugged her shoulders Who was there for me to marry she
answered The men who wanted me clerks young tradesmen down at
homeI wasnt taking any of that lot And the men I might have fancied
were all of them too poor There was one student Hes got on since
Easy enough for him to talk about waiting Meanwhile Well its like
somebody suggesting dinner to you the day after tomorrow All right
enough if youre not troubled with an appetite

The waiter came to clear the table They were almost the last customers
left The mans tone and manner jarred upon Joan She had not noticed
it before Joan ordered coffee and the girl exchanging a joke with the
waiter added a liqueur

But why should you give up your art persisted Joan It was that was
sticking in her mind I should have thought that if only for the sake
of the child you would have gone on with it

Oh I told myself all that answered the girl Was going to devote my
life to it Did for nearly two years Till I got sick of living like a
nun never getting a bit of excitement You see Ive got the poison in
me Or maybe it had always been there

Whats become of it asked Joan The child

Mothers got it answered the girl Seemed best for the poor little
beggar Im supposed to be dead and my husband gone abroad She gave
a short dry laugh Mother brings him up to see me once a year Theyve
got quite fond of him

What are you doing now asked Joan in a low tone

Oh you neednt look so scared laughed the girl I havent come down
to that Her voice had changed It had a note of shrillness In some
indescribable way she had grown coarse Im a kept woman she
explained What else is any woman

She reached for her jacket and the waiter sprang forward and helped her
on with it prolonging the business needlessly She wished him Good
evening in a tone of distant hauteur and led the way to the door
Outside the street was dim and silent Joan held out her hand

No hope of happy endings she said with a forced laugh Couldnt
marry him I suppose

He has asked me answered the girl with a swagger Not sure that it
would suit me now Theyre not so nice to you when theyve got you fixed
up So long

She turned abruptly and walked rapidly away Joan moved instinctively in
the opposite direction and after a few minutes found herself in a broad
welllighted thoroughfare A newsboy was shouting his wares

Orrible murder of a woman Shockin details Speshul repeating it
over and over again in a hoarse expressionless monotone

He was selling the papers like hot cakes the purchasers too eager to
even wait for their change She wondered with a little lump in her
throat how many would have stopped to buy had he been calling instead
Discovery of new sonnet by Shakespeare Extra special

Through swinging doors she caught glimpses of foul interiors crowded
with men and women released from their toil taking their evening
pleasure From coloured posters outside the great theatres and music
halls vulgarity and lewdness leered at her side by side with
announcements that the house was full From every roaring corner
scintillating lights flared forth the merits of this public benefactors
whisky of this other celebritys beer it seemed the only message the
people cared to hear Even among the sirens of the pavement she noticed
that the quiet and merely pretty were hardly heeded It was everywhere
the painted and the overdressed that drew the roving eyes

She remembered a pet dog that someone had given her when she was a girl
and how one afternoon she had walked with the tears streaming down her
face because in spite of her scoldings and her pleadings it would keep
stopping to lick up filth from the roadway A kindly passerby had
laughed and told her not to mind

Why thats a sign of breeding that is Missie the man had explained
Its the classy ones that are always the worst

It had come to her afterwards craving with its soft brown troubled eyes
for forgiveness But she had never been able to break it of the habit

Must man for ever be chained by his appetites to the unclean ever be
driven back dragged down again into the dirt by his own instincts ever
be rendered useless for all finer purposes by the baseness of his own
desires

The City of her Dreams The mingled voices of the crowd shaped itself
into a mocking laugh

It seemed to her that it was she that they were laughing at pointing her
out to one another jeering at her reviling her threatening her

She hurried onward with bent head trying to escape them She felt so
small so helpless Almost she cried out in her despair

She must have walked mechanically Looking up she found herself in her
own street And as she reached her doorway the tears came suddenly

She heard a quick step behind her and turning she saw a man with a
latch key in his hand He passed her and opened the door and then
facing round stood aside for her to enter He was a sturdy thickset
man with a strong massive face It would have been ugly but for the
deep flashing eyes There was tenderness and humour in them

We are next floor neighbours he said My names Phillips

Joan thanked him As he held the door open for her their hands
accidentally touched Joan wished him goodnight and went up the stairs
There was no light in her room only the faint reflection of the street
lamp outside

She could still see him the boyish smile And his voice that had sent
her tears back again as if at the word of command

She hoped he had not seen them What a little fool she was

A little laugh escaped her




CHAPTER VI


One day Joan lunching at the club met Madge Singleton

Ive had such a funny letter from Flossie said Joan begging me
almost with tears in her ink to come to her on Sunday evening to meet a
gentleman friend of hers as she calls him and give her my opinion of
him What on earth is she up to

Its all right answered Madge She doesnt really want our opinion
of himor rather she doesnt want our real opinion of him She only
wants us to confirm hers Shes engaged to him

Flossie engaged Joan seemed surprised

Yes answered Madge It used to be a custom Young men used to ask
young women to marry them And if they consented it was called being
engaged Still prevails so I am told in certain classes

Thanks said Joan I have heard of it

I thought perhaps you hadnt from your tone explained Madge

But if shes already engaged to him why risk criticism of him argued
Joan ignoring Madges flippancy Its too late

Oh shes going to break it off unless we all assure her that we find
him brainy Madge explained with a laugh It seems her father wasnt
brainy and her mother was Or else it was the other way about Im not
quite sure But whichever it was it led to ructions Myself if hes
at all possible and seems to care for her I intend to find him
brilliant

And suppose she repeats her mothers experience suggested Joan

There were the NortonBrowns answered Madge Impossible to have
found a more evenly matched pair They both write novelsvery good
novels too and got jealous of one another and threw pressnotices at
one anothers head all breakfasttime until they separated Dont know
of any recipe myself for being happy ever after marriage except not
expecting it

Or keeping out of it altogether added Joan

Ever spent a day at the Home for Destitute Gentlewomen at East Sheen
demanded Madge

Not yet admitted Joan May have to later on

It ought to be included in every womans education Madge continued
It is reserved for spinsters of over fortyfive Susan Fleming wrote an
article upon it for the _Teachers Friend_ and spent an afternoon and
evening there A month later she married a grocer with five children
The only sound suggestion for avoiding trouble that I ever came across
was in a burlesque of the _Blue Bird_ You remember the scene where the
spirits of the children are waiting to go down to earth and be made into
babies Someone had stuck up a notice at the entrance to the gangway
Dont get born It only means worry

Flossie had her dwellingplace in a second floor bedsittingroom of a
lodging house in Queens Square Bloomsbury but the drawingroom floor
being for the moment vacant Flossie had persuaded her landlady to let
her give her party there it seemed as if fate approved of the idea The
room was fairly full when Joan arrived Flossie took her out on the
landing and closed the door behind them

You will be honest with me wont you pleaded Flossie because its
so important and I dont seem able to think for myself As they say no
man can be his own solicitor can he Of course I like him and all
thatvery much And I really believe he loves me We were children
together when Mummy was alive and then he had to go abroad and has only
just come back Of course Ive got to think of him too as he says
But then on the other hand I dont want to make a mistake That would
be so terrible for both of us and of course I am clever and there was
poor Mummy and Daddy Ill tell you all about them one day It was so
awfully sad Get him into a corner and talk to him Youll be able to
judge in a moment youre so wonderful Hes quiet on the outside but I
think theres depth in him We must go in now

She had talked so rapidly Joan felt as if her hat were being blown away
She had difficulty in recognizing Flossie All the cocksure pertness had
departed She seemed just a kid

Joan promised faithfully and Flossie standing on tiptoe suddenly
kissed her and then bustled her in

Flossies young man was standing near the fire talking or rather
listening to a birdlike little woman in a short white frock and blue
ribbons A sombre lady just behind her whom Joan from the distance took
to be her nurse turned out to be her secretary whose duty it was to be
always at hand prepared to take down any happy idea that might occur to
the birdlike little woman in the course of conversation The birdlike
little woman was Miss Rose Tolley a popular novelist She was
explaining to Flossies young man whose name was Sam Halliday the
reason for her having written Running Waters her latest novel

It is daring she admitted I must be prepared for opposition But
it had to be stated

I take myself as typical she continued When I was twenty I could
have loved you You were the type of man I did love

Mr Halliday who had been supporting the weight of his body upon his
right leg transferred the burden to his left

But now Im thirtyfive and I couldnt love you if I tried She shook
her curls at him It isnt your fault It is that I have changed
Suppose Id married you

Bit of bad luck for both of us suggested Mr Halliday

A tragedy Miss Tolley corrected him There are millions of such
tragedies being enacted around us at this moment Sensitive women
compelled to suffer the embraces of men that they have come to loathe
Whats to be done

Flossie who had been hovering impatient broke in

Oh dont you believe her she advised Mr Halliday She loves you
still Shes only teasing you This is Joan

She introduced her Miss Tolley bowed and allowed herself to be drawn
away by a lankhaired young man who had likewise been waiting for an
opening He represented the Uplift Film Association of Chicago and was
wishful to know if Miss Tolley would consent to altering the last chapter
and so providing Running Waters with a happy ending He pointed out
the hopelessness of it in its present form for film purposes

The discussion was brief Then Ill send your agent the contract to
morrow Joan overheard him say a minute later

Mr Sam Halliday she liked at once He was a cleanshaven squarejawed
young man with quiet eyes and a pleasant voice

Try and find me brainy he whispered to her as soon as Flossie was out
of earshot Talk to me about China Im quite intelligent on China

They both laughed and then shot a guilty glance in Flossies direction

Do the women really crush their feet asked Joan

Yes he answered All those who have no use for them About one per
cent of the population To listen to Miss Tolley you would think that
half the women wanted a new husband every ten years Its always the one
per cent that get themselves talked about The other ninetynine are
too busy

You are young for a philosopher said Joan

He laughed I told you Id be all right if you started me on China he
said

Why are you marrying Flossie Joan asked him She thought his point
of view would be interesting

Not sure I am yet he answered with a grin It depends upon how I get
through this evening He glanced round the room Have I got to pass
all this crowd I wonder he added

Joans eyes followed It was certainly an odd collection Flossie in
her hunt for brains had issued her invitations broadcast and her fate
had been that of the Charity concert Not all the stars upon whom she
had most depended had turned up On the other hand not a single freak
had failed her At the moment the centre of the room was occupied by a
gentleman and two ladies in classical drapery They were holding hands
in an attitude suggestive of a basrelief Joan remembered them having
seen them on one or two occasions wandering in the Kings Road Chelsea
still maintaining as far as the traffic would allow the basrelief
suggestion and generally surrounded by a crowd of children ever hopeful
that at the next corner they would stop and do something really
interesting They belonged to a society whose object was to lure the
London public by the force of example towards the adoption of the early
Greek fashions and the simpler Greek attitudes A friend of Flossies
had thrown in her lot with them but could never be induced to abandon
her umbrella They also as Joan told herself were reformers Near to
them was a picturesque gentleman with a beard down to his waist whose
stuntas Flossie would have termed itwas hygienic clothing it
seemed to contain an undue proportion of fresh air There were ladies in
coats and standup collars and gentlemen with ringlets More than one
of the guests would have been better though perhaps not happier for a
bath

I fancy thats the idea said Joan What will you do if you fail Go
back to China

Yes he answered And take her with me Poor little girl

Joan rather resented his tone

We are not all alike she remarked Some of us are quite sane

He looked straight into her eyes You are he said I have been
reading your articles They are splendid Im going to help

How can you she said I mean how will you

Shipping is my business he said Im going to help sailor men See
that they have somewhere decent to go to and dont get robbed And then
there are the Lascars poor devils Nobody ever takes their part

How did you come across them she asked The articles I mean Did
Flo give them to you

No he answered Just chance Caught sight of your photo

Tell me she said If it had been the photo of a woman with a bony
throat and a beaky nose would you have read them

He thought a moment Guess not he answered Youre just as bad he
continued Isnt it the palefaced young clergyman with the wavy hair
and the beautiful voice that you all flock to hear No getting away from
nature But it wasnt only that He hesitated

I want to know she said

You looked so young he answered I had always had the idea that it
was up to the old people to put the world to rightsthat all I had to do
was to look after myself It came to me suddenly while you were talking
to meI mean while I was reading you that if you were worrying yourself
about it Id got to come in toothat it would be mean of me not to It
wasnt like being preached to It was somebody calling for help

Instinctively she held out her hand and he grasped it

Flossie came up at the same instant She wanted to introduce him to Miss
Lavery who had just arrived

Hullo she said Are you two concluding a bargain

Yes said Joan We are founding the League of Youth Youve got to
be in it We are going to establish branches all round the world

Flossies young man was whisked away Joan who had seated herself in a
small chair was alone for a few minutes

Miss Tolley had chanced upon a Human Document with the help of which she
was hopeful of starting a Press Controversy concerning the morality or
otherwise of Running Waters The secretary stood just behind her
taking notes They had drifted quite close Joan could not help
overhearing

It always seemed to me immoral the marriage ceremony the Human
Document was explaining She was a thin sallow woman with an untidy
head and restless eyes that seemed to be always seeking something to look
at and never finding it How can we pledge the future To bind oneself
to live with a man when perhaps we have ceased to care for him its
hideous

Miss Tolley murmured agreement

Our love was beautiful continued the Human Document eager
apparently to relate her experience for the common good just because
it was a free gift We were not fettered to one another At any moment
either of us could have walked out of the house The idea never occurred
to us not for yearsfive to be exact

The secretary at a sign from Miss Tolley made a memorandum of it

And then did your feelings towards him change suddenly questioned Miss
Tolley

No explained the Human Document in the same quick even tones so
far as I was concerned I was not conscious of any alteration in my own
attitude But he felt the need of more solitudefor his development We
parted quite good friends

Oh said Miss Tolley And were there any children

Only two answered the Human Document both girls

What has become of them persisted Miss Tolley

The Human Document looked offended You do not think I would have
permitted any power on earth to separate them from me do you she
answered I said to him They are mine mine Where I go they go
Where I stay they stay He saw the justice of my argument

And they are with you now concluded Miss Tolley

You must come and see them the Human Document insisted Such dear
magnetic creatures I superintend their entire education myself We
have a cottage in Surrey Its rather a tight fit You see there are
seven of us now But the three girls can easily turn in together for a
night Abner will be delighted

Abner is your second suggested Miss Tolley

My third the Human Document corrected her After Eustace I married
Ivanoff I say married because I regard it as the holiest form of
marriage He had to return to his own country There was a political
movement on foot He felt it his duty to go I want you particularly to
meet the boy He will interest you

Miss Tolley appeared to be getting muddled Whose boy she demanded

Ivanoffs explained the Human Document He was our only child

Flossie appeared towing a whitehaired distinguishedlooking man a Mr
Folk She introduced him and immediately disappeared Joan wished she
had been left alone a little longer She would like to have heard more
Especially was she curious concerning Abner the ladys third Would the
higher moral law compel him likewise to leave the poor lady saddled
with another couple of children Or would she on this occasion get
inor rather get off first Her own fancy was to back Abner She did
catch just one sentence before Miss Tolley having obtained more food for
reflection than perhaps she wanted signalled to her secretary that the
notebook might be closed

Womans right to follow the dictates of her own heart uncontrolled by
any law the Human Document was insisting That is one of the first
things we must fight for

Mr Folk was a wellknown artist He lived in Paris You are
wonderfully like your mother he told Joan In appearance I mean he
added I knew her when she was Miss Caxton I acted with her in
America

Joan made a swift effort to hide her surprise She had never heard of
her mother having been upon the stage

I did not know that you had been an actor she answered

I wasnt really explained Mr Folk I just walked and talked
naturally It made rather a sensation at the time Your mother was a
genius You have never thought of going on the stage yourself

No said Joan I dont think Ive got what you call the artistic
temperament I have never felt drawn towards anything of that sort

I wonder he said You could hardly be your mothers daughter without
it

Tell me said Joan What was my mother like I can only remember her
as more or less of an invalid

He did not reply to her question Master or Mistress Eminent Artist
he said intends to retire from his or her particular stage whatever it
may be That paragraph ought always to be put among the obituary
notices

Whats your line he asked her I take it you have one by your being
here Besides I am sure you have I am an old fighter I can tell the
young soldier Whats your regiment

Joan laughed Im a drummer boy she answered I beat my drum each
week in a Sunday newspaper hoping the lads will follow

You feel you must beat that drum he suggested Beat it louder and
louder and louder till all the world shall hear it

Yes Joan agreed I think that does describe me

He nodded I thought you were an artist he said Dont let them
ever take your drum away from you Youll go to pieces and get into
mischief without it

I know an old actress he continued Shes the mother of four They
are all on the stage and theyve all made their mark The youngest was
born in her dressingroom just after the curtain had fallen She was
playing the Nurse to your mothers Juliet She is still the best Nurse
that I know Jacks always worrying me to chuck it and devote myself to
the children she confided to me one evening while she was waiting for
her cue But as I tell him Im more helpful to them being with them
half the day alive than all the day dead Thats an anecdote worth
remembering when your time comes If God gives woman a drum he doesnt
mean man to take it away from her She hasnt got to be playing it for
twentyfour hours a day Id like you to have seen your mothers
Cordelia

Flossie was tacking her way towards them Joan acted on impulse I
wish youd give me your address she said where I could write to you
Or perhaps you would not mind my coming and seeing you one day I would
like you to tell me more about my mother

He gave her his address in Paris where he was returning almost
immediately

Do come he said It will take me back thirtythree years I
proposed to your mother on La Grande Terrasse at St Germain We will
walk there Im still a bachelor He laughed and kissing her hand
allowed himself to be hauled away by Flossie in exchange for Mrs
Phillips for whom Miss Lavery had insisted on an invitation

Joan had met Mrs Phillips several times and once on the stairs had
stopped and spoken to her but had never been introduced to her formally
till now

We have been meaning to call on you so often panted Mrs Phillips The
room was crowded and the exertion of squeezing her way through had winded
the poor lady We take so much interest in your articles My husband
she paused for a second before venturing upon the word and the aitch
came out somewhat overaspiratedreads them most religiously You must
come and dine with us one evening

Joan answered that she would be very pleased

I will find out when Robert is free and run up and let you know she
continued Of course there are so many demands upon him especially
during this period of national crisis that I spare him all the social
duties that I can But I shall insist on his making an exception in your
case

Joan murmured her sense of favour but hoped she would not be allowed to
interfere with more pressing calls upon Mr Phillipss time

It will do him good answered Mrs Phillips getting away from them
all for an hour or two I dont see much of him myself

She glanced round and lowered her voice They tell me she said that
youre a BA

Yes answered Joan One goes in for it more out of vanity Im
afraid than for any real purpose that it serves

I took one or two prizes myself said Mrs Phillips But of course
one forgets things I was wondering if you would mind if I ran up
occasionally to ask you a question Of course as you know my usband
as ad so few advantagesthe ladys mind was concerned with more
important matters and the aspirates on this occasion got themselves
neglectedIt is wonderful what he as done without them But if now
and then I could elp him

There was something about the poor foolish painted face as it looked up
pleadingly that gave it a momentary touch of beauty

Do said Joan speaking earnestly I shall be so very pleased if you
will

Thank you said the woman Miss Lavery came up in a hurry to introduce
her to Miss Tolley I am telling all my friends to read your articles
she added resuming the gracious patroness as she bowed her adieus

Joan was alone again for a while A handsome girl with her hair cut
short and parted at the side was discussing diseases of the spine with a
curlyheaded young man in a velvet suit The gentleman was describing
some of the effects in detail Joan felt there was danger of her being
taken ill if she listened any longer and seeing Madges brother near the
door and unoccupied she made her way across to him

Niel Singleton or Keeley as he called himself upon the stage was quite
unlike his sister He was short and plump with a preternaturally solemn
face contradicted by small twinkling eyes He motioned Joan to a chair
and told her to keep quiet and not disturb the meeting

Is he brainy he whispered after a minute

I like him said Joan

I didnt ask you if you liked him he explained to her I asked you
if he was brainy Im not too sure that you like brainy men

Yes I do said Joan I like you sometimes

Now none of that he said severely Its no good your thinking of
me Im wedded to my art We are talking about Mr Halliday

What does Madge think of him asked Joan

Madge has fallen in love with him and her judgment is not to be relied
upon he said I suppose you couldnt answer a straight question if
you tried

Dont be so harsh with me pleaded Joan meekly Im trying to think
Yes she continued decidedly hes got brains

Enough for the two of them demanded Mr Singleton Because he will
want them Now think before you speak

Joan considered Yes she answered I should say hes just the man
to manage her

Then its settled he said We must save her

Save her from what demanded Joan

From his saying to himself This is Flossies idea of a party This is
the sort of thing that if I marry her I am letting myself in for If
he hasnt broken off the engagement already we may be in time

He led the way to the piano Tell Madge I want her he whispered He
struck a few notes and then in a voice that drowned every other sound in
the room struck up a comic song

The effect was magical

He followed it up with another This one with a chorus consisting
chiefly of Umpty Umpty Umpty Umpty Ay which was vociferously encored

By the time it was done with Madge had discovered a girl who could sing
Three Little Pigs and a sad palefaced gentleman who told stories At
the end of one of them Madges brother spoke to Joan in a tone more of
sorrow than of anger

Hardly the sort of anecdote that a truly noble and highminded young
woman would have received with laughter he commented

Did I laugh said Joan

Your having done so unconsciously only makes the matter worse observed
Mr Singleton I had hoped it emanated from politeness not enjoyment

Dont tease her said Madge Shes having an evening off

Joan and the Singletons were the last to go They promised to show Mr
Halliday a short cut to his hotel in Holborn

Have you thanked Miss Lessing for a pleasant evening asked Mr
Singleton turning to Mr Halliday

He laughed and put his arm round her Poor little woman he said
Youre looking so tired It was jolly at the end He kissed her

He had passed through the swing doors and they were standing on the
pavement waiting for Joans bus

Why did we all like him asked Joan Even Miss Lavery Theres
nothing extraordinary about him

Oh yes there is said Madge Love has lent him gilded armour From
his helmet waves her crest she quoted Most men look fine in that
costume Pity they cant always wear it

The conductor seemed impatient Joan sprang upon the step and waved her
hand




CHAPTER VII


Joan was making herself a cup of tea when there came a tap at the door
It was Mrs Phillips

I heard you come in she said Youre not busy are you

No answered Joan I hope youre not Im generally in about this
time and its always nice to gossip over a dish of tea

Why do you say dish of tea asked Mrs Phillips as she lowered
herself with evident satisfaction into the easy chair Joan placed for
her

Oh I dont know laughed Joan Dr Johnson always talked of a dish
of tea Gives it a literary flavour

Ive heard of him said Mrs Phillips Hes worth reading isnt he

Well he talked more amusingly than he wrote explained Joan Get
Boswells Life of him Or Ill lend you mine she added if youll be
careful of it Youll find all the passages marked that are best worth
remembering At least I think so

Thanks said Mrs Phillips You see as the wife of a public man I
get so little time for study

Is it settled yet asked Joan Are they going to make room for him in
the Cabinet

Im afraid so answered Mrs Phillips Oh of course I want him to
she corrected herself And he must of course if the King insists upon
it But I wish it hadnt all come with such a whirl What shall I have
to do do you think

Joan was pouring out the tea Oh nothing she answered but just be
agreeable to the right people Hell tell you who they are And take
care of him

I wish Id taken more interest in politics when I was young said Mrs
Phillips Of course when I was a girl women werent supposed to

Do you know I shouldnt worry about them if I were you Joan advised
her Let him forget them when hes with you A man can have too much
of a good thing she laughed

I wonder if youre right mused Mrs Phillips He does often say that
hed just as soon I didnt talk about them

Joan shot a glance from over her cup The poor puzzled face was staring
into the fire Joan could almost hear him saying it

Im sure I am she said Make homecoming a change to him As you
said yourself the other evening Its good for him to get away from it
all now and then

I must try agreed Mrs Phillips looking up What sort of things
ought I to talk to him about do you think

Joan gave an inward sigh Hadnt the poor lady any friends of her own
Oh almost anything she answered vaguely so long as its cheerful
and nonpolitical What used you to talk about before he became a great
man

There came a wistful look into the worried eyes Oh it was all so
different then she said E just liked toyou know We didnt seem
to ave to talk E was a rare one to tease I didnt know ow clever
e was then

It seemed a difficult case to advise upon How long have you been
married Joan asked

Fifteen years she answered I was a bit older than im But Ive
never looked my age they tell me Lord what a boy e was Swept you
off your feet like E wasnt the only one Id got a way with me I
suppose Anyhow the men seemed to think so There was always a few
anging about Like flies round a oneypot Mother used to say She
giggled But e wouldnt take No for an answer And I didnt want to
give it im neither I was gone on im right enough No use saying I
wasnt

You must be glad you didnt say No suggested Joan

Yes she answered Es got on I always think of that little poem
Lord Burleigh she continued whenever I get worrying about myself
Ever read it

Yes answered Joan He was a landscape painter wasnt he

Thats the one said Mrs Phillips I little thought I was letting
myself in for being the wife of a big pot when Bob Phillips came along in
is miners jacket

Youll soon get used to it Joan told her The great thing is not to
be afraid of ones fate whatever it is but just to do ones best It
was rather like talking to a child

Youre the right sort to put eart into a body Im glad I came up
said Mrs Phillips I get a bit down in the mouth sometimes when e
goes off into one of is brown studies and I dont seem to know what
es thinking about But it dont last long I was always one of the
lightearted ones

They discussed life on two thousand a year the problems it would
present and Mrs Phillips became more cheerful Joan laid herself out
to be friendly She hoped to establish an influence over Mrs Phillips
that should be for the poor ladys good and as she felt instinctively
for poor Phillipss also It was not an unpleasing face Underneath the
paint it was kind and womanly Joan was sure he would like it better
clean A few months attention to diet would make a decent figure of her
and improve her wind Joan watched her spreading the butter a quarter of
an inch thick upon her toast and restrained with difficulty the impulse
to take it away from her And her clothes Joan had seen guys carried
through the streets on the fifth of November that were less obtrusive

She remembered as she was taking her leave what she had come for which
was to invite Joan to dinner on the following Friday

Its just a homely affair she explained She had recovered her form
and was now quite the lady again Two other guests beside yourself a
Mr AirlieI am sure you will like him Hes so dilletantyand Mr
McKean Hes the young man upstairs Have you met him

Joan hadnt except once on the stairs when to avoid having to pass her
he had gone down again and out into the street From the doorstep she
had caught sight of his disappearing coattails round the corner
Yielding to impishness she had run after him and his expression of
blank horror when glancing over his shoulder he found her walking
abstractedly three yards behind him had gladdened all her evening

Joan recounted the episodeso far as the doorstep

He tried to be shy with me said Mrs Phillips but I wouldnt let
him I chipped him out of it If hes going to write plays as I told
him he will have to get over his fear of a petticoat

She offered her cheek and Joan kissed it somewhat gingerly

You wont mind Robert not wearing evening dress she said He never
will if he can help it I shall just slip on a semitoilette myself

Joan had difficulty in deciding on her own frock Her four evening
dresses as she walked round them spread out upon the bed all looked
too imposing for what Mrs Phillips had warned her would be a homely
affair She had one other a greyishfawn with sleeves to the elbow
that she had had made expressly for public dinners and political At
Homes But that would be going to the opposite extreme and might seem
discourteousto her hostess Besides mousey colours didnt really
suit her They gave her a curious sense of being affected In the end
she decided to risk a black crepedechine square cut with a girdle of
gold embroidery There couldnt be anything quieter than black and the
gold embroidery was of the simplest She would wear it without any
jewellery whatever except just a star in her hair The result as she
viewed the effect in the long glass quite satisfied her Perhaps the
jewelled star did scintillate rather It had belonged to her mother But
her hair was so full of shadows it wanted something to relieve it Also
she approved the curved line of her bare arms It was certainly very
beautiful a womans arm She took her gloves in her hand and went down

Mr Phillips was not yet in the room Mrs Phillips in applegreen with
an ostrich feather in her hair greeted her effusively and introduced
her to her fellow guests Mr Airlie was a slight elegant gentleman of
uncertain age with sandy hair and beard cut Vandyke fashion He asked
Joans permission to continue his cigarette

You have chosen the better part he informed her on her granting it
When Im not smoking Im talking

Mr McKean shook her hand vigorously without looking at her

And this is Hilda concluded Mrs Phillips She ought to be in bed if
she hadnt a naughty Daddy who spoils her

A lank blackhaired girl with a pair of burning eyes looking out of a
face that but for the thin line of the lips would have been absolutely
colourless rose suddenly from behind a bowl of artificial flowers Joan
could not suppress a slight start she had not noticed her on entering
The girl came slowly forward and Joan felt as if the uncanny eyes were
eating her up She made an effort and held out her hand with a smile
and the girls long thin fingers closed on it in a pressure that hurt
She did not speak

She only came back yesterday for the halfterm explained Mrs
Phillips Theres no keeping her away from her books Twas her own
wish to be sent to boardingschool How would you like to go to Girton
and be a BA like Miss Allway she asked turning to the child

Phillipss entrance saved the need of a reply To the evident surprise
of his wife he was in evening clothes

Hulloa Youve got em on she said

He laughed I shall have to get used to them sooner or later he said

Joan felt relievedshe hardly knew whythat he bore the test It was a
wellbuilt athletic frame and he had gone to a good tailor He looked
taller in them and the strong cleanshaven face less rugged

Joan sat next to him at the round dinnertable with the child the other
side of him She noticed that he ate as far as possible with his right
handhis hands were large but smooth and well shapedhis left
remaining under the cloth beneath which the childs right hand when
free would likewise disappear For a while the conversation consisted
chiefly of anecdotes by Mr Airlie There were few public men and women
about whom he did not know something to their disadvantage Joan
listening found herself repeating the experience of a night or two
previous when during a performance of _Hamlet_ Niel Singleton who was
playing the gravedigger had taken her behind the scenes Hamlet the
King of Denmark and the Ghost were sharing a bottle of champagne in the
Ghosts dressingroom it happened to be the Ghosts birthday On her
return to the front of the house her interest in the play was gone It
was absurd that it should be so but the fact remained

Mr Airlie had lunched the day before with a leonine old gentleman who
every Sunday morning thundered forth Social Democracy to enthusiastic
multitudes on Tower Hill Joan had once listened to him and had almost
been converted he was so tremendously in earnest She now learnt that
he lived in Curzon Street Mayfair and filled in private life the
perfectly legitimate calling of a company promoter in partnership with a
Dutch Jew His latest prospectus dwelt upon the profits to be derived
from an amalgamation of the leading tanning industries by means of which
the price of leather could be enormously increased

It was utterly illogical but her interest in the principles of Social
Democracy was gone

A very little while ago Mr Airlie in his capacity of second cousin to
one of the ladies concerned a charming girl but impulsive had been
called upon to attend a family council of a painful nature The
gentlemans name took Joans breath away it was the name of one of her
heroes an eminent writer one might almost say prophet She had
hitherto read his books with grateful reverence They pictured for her
the world made perfect and explained to her just precisely how it was to
be accomplished But as far as his own particular corner of it was
concerned he seemed to have made a sad mess of it Human nature of
quite an oldfashioned pattern had crept in and spoilt all his own
theories

Of course it was unreasonable The signpost may remain embedded in
weeds it notwithstanding points the way to the fair city She told
herself this but it left her still shorttempered She didnt care
which way it pointed She didnt believe there was any fair city

There was a famous preacher He lived the simple life in a small house
in Battersea and consecrated all his energies to the service of the
poor Almost by his unselfish zeal he had persuaded Joan of the
usefulness of the church Mr Airlie frequently visited him They
interested one another What struck Mr Airlie most was the
selfsacrificing devotion with which the reverend gentlemans wife and
family surrounded him It was beautiful to see The calls upon his
moderate purse necessitated by his widespread and much paragraphed
activities left but a narrow margin for domestic expenses with the
result that often the only fire in the house blazed brightly in the study
where Mr Airlie and the reverend gentleman sat talking while mother and
children warmed themselves with sense of duty in the cheerless kitchen
And often as Mr Airlie who was of an inquiring turn of mind had
convinced himself the only evening meal that resources would permit was
the satisfying supper for one brought by the youngest daughter to her
father where he sat alone in the small diningroom

Mr Airlie picking daintily at his food continued his stories of
philanthropists who paid starvation wages of feminists who were a holy
terror to their women folk of socialists who travelled firstclass and
spent their winters in Egypt or Monaco of stern critics of public morals
who preferred the society of youthful affinities to the continued company
of elderly wives of poets who wrote divinely about babies feet and
whose children hated them

Do you think its all true Joan whispered to her host

He shrugged his shoulders No reason why it shouldnt be he said
Ive generally found him right

Ive never been able myself he continued to understand the Lords
enthusiasm for David I suppose it was the Psalms that did it

Joan was about to offer comment but was struck dumb with astonishment on
hearing McKeans voice it seemed he could talk He was telling of an
old Scotch peasant farmer A mean cantankerous old cuss whose curious
pride it was that he had never given anything away Not a crust nor a
sixpence nor a rag and never would Many had been the attempts to make
him break his boast some for the joke of the thing and some for the
need but none had ever succeeded It was his one claim to distinction
and he guarded it

One evening it struck him that the milkpail standing just inside the
window had been tampered with Next day he marked with a scratch the
inside of the pan and returning later found the level of the milk had
sunk half an inch So he hid himself and waited and at twilight the
next day the window was stealthily pushed open and two small terror
haunted eyes peered round the room They satisfied themselves that no
one was about and a tiny hand clutching a cracked jug was thrust swiftly
in and dipped into the pan and the window softly closed

He knew the thief the grandchild of an old bedridden dame who lived some
miles away on the edge of the moor The old man stood long watching the
small cloaked figure till it was lost in the darkness It was not till
he lay upon his dying bed that he confessed it But each evening from
that day he would steal into the room and see to it himself that the
window was left ajar

After the coffee Mrs Phillips proposed their adjourning to the drawing
room the other side of the folding doors which had been left open
Phillips asked her to leave Joan and himself where they were He wanted
to talk to her He promised not to bore her for more than ten minutes

The others rose and moved away Hilda came and stood before Joan with
her hands behind her

I am going to bed now she said I wanted to see you from what Papa
told me May I kiss you

It was spoken so gravely that Joan did not ask her as in lighter mood
she might have done what it was that Phillips had said She raised her
face quietly and the child bent forward and kissed her and went out
without looking back at either of them leaving Joan more serious than
there seemed any reason for Phillips filled his pipe and lighted it

I wish I had your pen he said suddenly breaking the silence Im
all right at talking but I want to get at the others the men and women
who never come thinking it has nothing to do with them Im shy and
awkward when I try to write There seems a barrier in front of me You
break through it One hears your voice Tell me he said are you
getting your way Do they answer you

Yes said Joan Not any great number of them not yet But enough to
show that I really am interesting them It grows every week

Tell them that he said Let them hear each other Its the same at
a meeting You wait ten minutes sometimes before one man will summon up
courage to put a question but once one or two have ventured they spring
up all round you I was wondering he added if you would help me let
me use you now and again

It is what I should love she answered Tell me what to do She was
not conscious of the low vibrating tone in which she spoke

I want to talk to them he said about their stomachs I want them to
see the need of concentrating upon the food problem insisting that it
shall be solved The other things can follow

There was an old Egyptian chap he said a governor of one of their
provinces thousands of years before the Pharaohs were ever heard of
They dug up his tomb a little while ago It bore this inscription In
my time no man went hungry Id rather have that carved upon my
gravestone than the boastings of all the robbers and the butchers of
history Think what it must have meant in that land of drought and
famine only a narrow strip of river bank where a grain of corn would
grow and that only when old Nile was kind If not your nearest
supplies five hundred miles away across the desert your only means of
transport the slowmoving camel Your convoy must be guarded against
attack provided with provisions and water for a two months journey Yet
he never failed his people Fat year and lean year In my time no man
went hungry And here today with our steamships and our railways
with the granaries of the world filled to overflowing one third of our
population lives on the border line of want In India they die by the
roadside Whats the good of it all your science and your art and your
religion How can you help mens souls if their bodies are starving A
hungry mans a hungry beast

I spent a week at Grimsby some years ago organizing a fishermans
union They used to throw the fish back into the sea tons upon tons of
it that men had risked their lives to catch that would have fed half
Londons poor There was a glut of it they said The market didnt
want it Funny isnt it a glut of food and the kiddies cant learn
their lessons for want of it I was talking with a farmer down in Kent
The plums were rotting on his trees There were too many of them that
was the trouble The railway carriage alone would cost him more than he
could get for them They were too cheap So nobody could have them
Its the muddle of the thing that makes me madthe ghastly muddleheaded
way the chief business of the world is managed Theres enough food
could be grown in this country to feed all the people and then of the
fragments each man might gather his ten basketsful Theres no miracle
needed I went into the matter once with Dalroy of the Board of
Agriculture Hes the best man theyve got if theyd only listen to
him Its never been organized thats all It isnt the fault of the
individual It ought not to be left to the individual The man who
makes a corner in wheat in Chicago and condemns millions to
privationlikely enough hes a decent sort of fellow in himself a kind
husband and fatherwould be upset for the day if he saw a child crying
for bread My dogs a decent enough little chap as dogs go but I dont
let him run my larder

It could be done with a little good will all round he continued and
nine men out of every ten would be the better off But they wont even
let you explain Their newspapers shout you down Its such a damned
fine world for the few never mind the many My father was a farm
labourer and all his life he never earned more than thirteen and
sixpence a week I left when I was twelve and went into the mines There
were six of us children and my mother brought us up healthy and decent
She fed us and clothed us and sent us to school and when she died we
buried her with the money she had put by for the purpose and never a
penny of charity had ever soiled her hands I can see them now Talk of
your Chancellors of the Exchequer and their problems She worked herself
to death of course Well thats all right One doesnt mind that
where one loves If they would only let you She had no opposition to
contend withno thwarting and hampering at every turnthe very people
you are working for hounded on against you The difficulty of a man like
myself who wants to do something who could do something is that for
the best part of his life he is fighting to be allowed to do it By the
time Ive lived down their lies and got my chance my energy will be
gone

He knocked the ashes from his pipe and relit it

Ive no quarrel with the rich he said I dont care how many rich
men there are so long as there are no poor Who does I was riding on
a bus the other day and there was a man beside me with a bandaged head
Hed been hurt in that railway smash at Morpeth He hadnt claimed
damages from the railway company and wasnt going to Oh its only a
few scratches he said Theyll be hit hard enough as it is If hed
been a poor devil on eighteen shillings a week it would have been
different He was an engineer earning good wages so he wasnt feeling
sore and bitter against half the world Suppose you tried to run an army
with your men half starved while your officers had more than they could
eat Its been tried and whats been the result See that your soldiers
have their proper rations and the General can sit down to his sixcourse
dinner if he will They are not begrudging it to him

A nation works on its stomach Underfeed your rank and file and what
sort of a fight are you going to put up against your rivals I want to
see England going ahead I want to see her workers properly fed I want
to see the corn upon her unused acres the cattle grazing on her wasted
pastures I object to the food being thrown into the sealeft to rot
upon the ground while men are hungrysidetracked in Chicago while the
children grow up stunted I want the commissariat properly organized

He had been staring through her rather than at her so it had seemed to
Joan Suddenly their eyes met and he broke into a smile

Im so awfully sorry he said Ive been talking to you as if you
were a public meeting Im afraid Im more used to them than I am to
women Please forgive me

The whole man had changed The eyes had a timid pleading in them

Joan laughed Ive been feeling as if I were the King of Bavaria she
said

How did he feel he asked her leaning forward

He had his own private theatre Joan explained where Wagner gave his
operas And the King was the sole audience

I should have hated that he said if I had been Wagner

He looked at her and a flush passed over his boyish face

All right he said if it had been a queen

Joan found herself tracing patterns with her spoon upon the tablecloth
But you have won now she said still absorbed apparently with her
drawing you are going to get your chance

He gave a short laugh A trick he said to weaken me They think to
shave my locks show me to the people bound by their red tape To put it
another way a rat among the terriers

Joan laughed You dont somehow suggest the rat she said rather
another sort of beast

What do you advise me he asked I havent decided yet

They were speaking in whispered tones Through the open doors they could
see into the other room Mrs Phillips under Airlies instructions was
venturing upon a cigarette

To accept she answered They wont influence youthe terriers as
you call them You are too strong It is you who will sway them It
isnt as if you were a mere agitator Take this opportunity of showing
them that you can build plan organize that you were meant to be a
ruler You cant succeed without them as things are Youve got to win
them over Prove to them that they can trust you

He sat for a minute tattooing with his fingers on the table before
speaking

Its the frills and flummery part of it that frightens me he said
You wouldnt think that sensitiveness was my weak point But it is
Ive stood up to a Birmingham mob that was waiting to lynch me and
enjoyed the experience but Id run ten miles rather than face a drawing
room of welldressed people with their masked faces and ironic
courtesies It leaves me for days feeling like a lobster that has lost
its shell

I wouldnt say it if I didnt mean it answered Joan but you havent
got to trouble yourself about that    Youre quite passable She
smiled It seemed to her that most women would find him more than
passable

He shook his head With you he said Theres something about you
that makes one ashamed of worrying about the little things But the
others the sneering women and the men who wink over their shoulder while
they talk to you I shall never be able to get away from them and of
course wherever I go

He stopped abruptly with a sudden tightening of the lips Joan followed
his eyes Mrs Phillips had swallowed the smoke and was giggling and
spluttering by turns The yellow ostrich feather had worked itself loose
and was rocking to and fro as if in a fit of laughter of its own

He pushed back his chair and rose Shall we join the others he said

He moved so that he was between her and the other room his back to the
open doors You think I ought to he said

Yes she answered firmly as if she were giving a command But he read
pity also in her eyes

Well have you two settled the affairs of the kingdom Is it all
decided asked Airlie

Yes he answered laughing We are going to say to the people Eat
drink and be wise

He rearranged his wifes feather and smoothed her tumbled hair She
looked up at him and smiled

Joan set herself to make McKean talk and after a time succeeded They
had a mutual friend a rawboned youth she had met at Cambridge He was
engaged to McKeans sister His eyes lighted up when he spoke of his
sister Jenny The Little Mother he called her

Shes the most beautiful body in all the world he said Though
merely seeing her you mightnt know it

He saw her home and went on up the stairs to his own floor

Joan stood for a while in front of the glass before undressing but felt
less satisfied with herself She replaced the star in its case and took
off the regallooking dress with the golden girdle and laid it carelessly
aside She seemed to be growing smaller

In her white night dress with her hair in two long plaits she looked at
herself once more She seemed to be no one of any importance at all
just a long little girl going to bed With no one to kiss her good
night

She blew out the candle and climbed into the big bed feeling very
lonesome as she used to when a child It had not troubled her until to
night Suddenly she sat up again She neednt be back in London before
Tuesday evening and today was only Friday She would run down home and
burst in upon her father He would be so pleased to see her

She would make him put his arms around her




CHAPTER VIII


She reached home in the evening She thought to find her father in his
study But they told her that now he usually sat alone in the great
drawingroom She opened the door softly The room was dark save for a
flicker of firelight she could see nothing Nor was there any sound

Dad she cried are you here

He rose slowly from a highbacked chair beside the fire

It is you he said He seemed a little dazed

She ran to him and seizing his listless arms put them round her

Give me a hug Dad she commanded A real hug

He held her to him for what seemed a long while There was strength in
his arms in spite of the bowed shoulders and white hair

I was afraid you had forgotten how to do it she laughed when at last
he released her Do you know you havent hugged me Dad since I was
five years old Thats nineteen years ago You do love me dont you

Yes he answered I have always loved you

She would not let him light the gas I have dinedin the train she
explained Let us talk by the firelight

She forced him gently back into his chair and seated herself upon the
floor between his knees What were you thinking of when I came in she
asked You werent asleep were you

No he answered Not that sort of sleep She could not see his
face But she guessed his meaning

Am I very like her she asked

Yes he answered Marvellously like her as she used to be except for
just one thing Perhaps that will come to you later I thought for the
moment as you stood there by the door     He did not finish the
sentence

Tell me about her she said I never knew she had been an actress

He did not ask her how she had learnt it She gave it up when we were
married he said The people she would have to live among would have
looked askance at her if they had known There seemed no reason why they
should

How did it all happen she persisted Was it very beautiful in the
beginning She wished she had not added that last The words had
slipped from her before she knew

Very beautiful he answered in the beginning

It was my fault he went on that it was not beautiful all through I
ought to have let her take up her work again as she wished to when she
found what giving it up meant to her The world was narrower then than
it is now and I listened to the world I thought it another voice

Its difficult to tell isnt it she said I wonder how one can

He did not answer and they sat for a time in silence

Did you ever see her act asked Joan

Every evening for about six months he answered A little flame shot
up and showed a smile upon his face

I owe to her all the charity and tenderness I know She taught it to me
in those months I might have learned more if I had let her go on
teaching It was the only way she knew

Joan watched her as gradually she shaped herself out of the shadows the
poor thin fretful lady of the ever restless hands with her bursts of
jealous passion her long moods of sullen indifference all her music
turned to waste

How did she come to fall in love with you asked Joan I dont mean
to be uncomplimentary Dad She laughed taking his hand in hers and
stroking it You must have been ridiculously handsome when you were
young And you must always have been strong and brave and clever I can
see such a lot of women falling in love with you But not the artistic
woman

It wasnt so incongruous at the time he answered My father had sent
me out to America to superintend a contract It was the first time I had
ever been away from home though I was nearly thirty and all my pentup
youth rushed out of me at once It was a harumscarum fellow mad with
the joy of life that made love to her not the man who went out nor the
man who came back It was at San Francisco that I met her She was
touring the Western States and I let everything go to the wind and
followed her It seemed to me that Heaven had opened up to me I fought
a duel in Colorado with a man who had insulted her The law didnt run
there in those days and three of his hired gunmen as they called them
held us up that night in the train and gave her the alternative of going
back with them and kissing him or seeing me dead at her feet I didnt
give her time to answer nor for them to finish It seemed a fine death
anyhow that And Id have faced Hell itself for the chance of fighting
for her Though she told me afterwards that if Id died shed have gone
back with them and killed him

Joan did not speak for a time She could see him gravea little
pompous in his Sunday black his footsteps creaking down the
stoneflagged aisle the silveredged collecting bag held stiffly in his
hand

Couldnt you have saved a bit Daddy she asked of all that wealth of
youthjust enough to live on

I might he answered if I had known the value of it I found a cable
waiting for me in New York My father had been dead a month and I had
to return immediately

And so you married her and took her drum away from her said Joan Oh
the thing God gives to some of us she explained to make a little
noise with and set the people marching

The little flame died out She could feel his body trembling

But you still loved her didnt you Dad she asked I was very
little at the time but I can just remember You seemed so happy
together Till her illness came

It was more than love he answered It was idolatry God punished me
for it He was a hard God my God

She raised herself putting her hands upon his shoulders so that her face
was very close to his What has become of Him Dad she said She
spoke in a cold voice as one does of a false friend

I do not know he answered her I dont seem to care

He must be somewhere she said the living God of love and hope the
God that Christ believed in

They were His last words too he answered My God my God why hast
Thou forsaken me

No not His last said Joan Lo I am with you always even unto the
end of the world Love was Christs God He will help us to find Him

Their arms were about one another Joan felt that a new need had been
born in her the need of loving and of being loved It was good to lay
her head upon his breast and know that he was glad of her coming

He asked her questions about herself But she could see that he was
tired so she told him it was too important a matter to start upon so
late She would talk about herself tomorrow It would be Sunday

Do you still go to the chapel she asked him a little hesitatingly

Yes he answered One lives by habit

It is the only Temple I know he continued after a moment Perhaps
God one day will find me there

He rose and lit the gas and a letter on the mantelpiece caught his eye

Have you heard from Arthur he asked suddenly turning to her

No Not since about a month she answered Why

He will be pleased to find you here waiting for him he said with a
smile handing her the letter He will be here some time tomorrow

Arthur Allway was her cousin the son of a Nonconformist Minister Her
father had taken him into the works and for the last three years he had
been in Egypt helping in the laying of a tramway line He was in love
with her at least so they all told her and his letters were certainly
somewhat committal Joan replied to themwhen she did not forget to do
soin a studiously sisterly vein and always reproved him for
unnecessary extravagance whenever he sent her a present The letter
announced his arrival at Southampton He would stop at Birmingham where
his parents lived for a couple of days and be in Liverpool on Sunday
evening so as to be able to get straight to business on Monday morning
Joan handed back the letter It contained nothing else

It only came an hour or two ago her father explained If he wrote to
you by the same post you may have left before it arrived

So long as he doesnt think that I came down specially to see him I
dont mind said Joan

They both laughed Hes a good lad said her father

They kissed good night and Joan went up to her own room She found it
just as she had left it A bunch of roses stood upon the dressingtable
Her father would never let anyone cut his roses but himself

Young Allway arrived just as Joan and her father had sat down to supper
A place had been laid for him He flushed with pleasure at seeing her
but was not surprised

I called at your diggings he said I had to go through London They
told me you had started It is good of you

No it isnt said Joan I came down to see Dad I didnt know you
were back She spoke with some asperity and his face fell

How are you she added holding out her hand Youve grown quite good
looking I like your moustache And he flushed again with pleasure

He had a sweet almost girlish face with delicate skin that the Egyptian
sun had deepened into ruddiness with soft dreamy eyes and golden hair
He looked lithe and agile rather than strong He was shy at first but
once set going talked freely and was interesting

His work had taken him into the Desert far from the beaten tracks He
described the life of the people very little different from what it must
have been in Noahs time For months he had been the only white man
there and had lived among them What had struck him was how little he
had missed all the paraphernalia of civilization once he had got over
the first shock He had learnt their sports and games wrestled and swum
and hunted with them Provided one was a little hungry and tired with
toil a stew of goats flesh with sweet cakes and fruits washed down
with wine out of a sheeps skin made a feast and after there was music
and singing and dancing or the travelling storyteller would gather
round him his rapt audience Paris had only robbed women of their grace
and dignity He preferred the young girls in their costume of the
fourteenth dynasty Progress he thought had tended only to complicate
life and render it less enjoyable All the essentials of happinesslove
courtship marriage the home children friendship social intercourse
and play were independent of it had always been there for the asking

Joan thought his mistake lay in regarding mans happiness as more
important to him than his selfdevelopment It was not what we got out
of civilization but what we put into it that was our gain Its luxuries
and ostentations were in themselves perhaps bad for us But the
pursuit of them was good It called forth thought and effort sharpened
our wits strengthened our brains Primitive man content with his
necessities would never have produced genius Art literature science
would have been stillborn

He hesitated before replying glancing at her furtively while crumbling
his bread When he did it was in the tone that one of her younger
disciples might have ventured into a discussion with Hypatia But he
stuck to his guns

How did she account for David and Solomon Moses and the Prophets They
had sprung from a shepherd race Yet surely there was genius
literature Greece owed nothing to progress She had preceded it Her
thinkers her poets her scientists had draws their inspiration from
nature not civilization Her art had sprung full grown out of the soil
We had never surpassed it

But the Greek ideal could not have been the right one or Greece would
not so utterly have disappeared suggested Mr Allway Unless you
reject the law of the survival of the fittest

He had no qualms about arguing with his uncle

So did Archimedes disappear he answered with a smile The nameless
Roman soldier remained That was hardly the survival of the fittest

He thought it the tragedy of the world that Rome had conquered Greece
imposing her lower ideals upon the race Rome should have been the
servant of Greece the hands directed by the brain She would have made
roads and harbours conducted the traffic reared the market place She
knew of the steam engine employed it for pumping water in the age of the
Antonines Sooner or later she would have placed it on rails and in
ships Rome should have been the policeman keeping the world in order
making it a fit habitation Her mistake was in regarding these things as
an end in themselves dreaming of nothing beyond From her we had
inherited the fallacy that man was made for the world not the world for
man Rome organized only for mans body Greece would have legislated
for his soul

They went into the drawingroom Her father asked her to sing and Arthur
opened the piano for her and lit the candles She chose some ballads and
a song of Herricks playing her own accompaniment while Arthur turned
the leaves She had a good voice a low contralto The room was high
and dimly lighted It looked larger than it really was Her father sat
in his usual chair beside the fire and listened with halfclosed eyes
Glancing now and then across at him she was reminded of Orchardsons
picture She was feeling sentimental a novel sensation to her She
rather enjoyed it

She finished with one of Burnss lyrics and then told Arthur that it was
now his turn and that she would play for him He shook his head
pleading that he was out of practice

I wish it she said speaking low And it pleased her that he made no
answer but to ask her what he should sing He had a light tenor voice
It was wobbly at first but improved as he went on They ended with a
duet

The next morning she went into town with them She never seemed to have
any time in London and wanted to do some shopping They joined her
again for lunch and afterwards at her fathers suggestion she and
Arthur went for a walk They took the tram out of the city and struck
into the country The leaves still lingered brown and red upon the
trees He carried her cloak and opened gates for her and held back
brambles while she passed She had always been indifferent to these
small gallantries but today she welcomed them She wished to feel her
power to attract and command They avoided all subjects on which they
could differ even in words They talked of people and places they had
known together They remembered their common love of animals and told of
the comedies and tragedies that had befallen their pets Joans regret
was that she had not now even a dog thinking it cruel to keep them in
London She hated the women she met dragging the poor little depressed
beasts about at the end of a string savage with them if they dared to
stop for a moment to exchange a passing wag of the tail with some other
little lonely sufferer It was as bad as keeping a lark in a cage She
had tried a cat but so often she did not get home till late and that was
just the time when the cat wanted to be out so that they seldom met He
suggested a parrot His experience of them was that they had no regular
hours and would willingly sit up all night if encouraged and talk all
the time Joans objection to running a parrot was that it stamped you
as an old maid and she wasnt that at least not yet She wondered if
she could make an owl really happy Minerva had an owl

He told her how one spring walking across a common after a fire he had
found a mother thrush burnt to death upon her nest her charred wings
spread out in a vain endeavour to protect her brood He had buried her
there among the blackened thorn and furze and placed a little cross of
stones above her

I hope nobody saw me he said with a laugh But I couldnt bear to
leave her there unhonoured

Its one of the things that make me less certain than I want to be of a
future existence said Joan the thought that animals can have no part
in it that all their courage and love and faithfulness dies with them
and is wasted

Are you sure it is he answered It would be so unreasonable

They had tea at an oldfashioned inn beside a stream It was a favourite
resort in summer time but now they had it to themselves The wind had
played pranks with her hair and he found a mirror and knelt before her
holding it

She stood erect looking down at him while seeming to be absorbed in the
rearrangement of her hair feeling a little ashamed of herself She was
encouraging him There was no other word for it She seemed to have
developed a sudden penchant for this sort of thing It would end in his
proposing to her and then she would have to tell him that she cared for
him only in a cousinly sort of waywhatever that might meanand that
she could never marry him She dared not ask herself why She must
manoeuvre to put it off as long as possible and meanwhile some opening
might occur to enlighten him She would talk to him about her work and
explain to him how she had determined to devote her life to it to the
exclusion of all other distractions If then he chose to go on loving
heror if he couldnt help itthat would not be her fault After all
it did him no harm She could always be gracious and kind to him It
was not as if she had tricked him He had always loved her Kneeling
before her serving her it was evident it made him supremely happy It
would be cruel of her to end it

The landlady entered unexpectedly with the tea but he did not rise till
Joan turned away nor did he seem disconcerted Neither did the
landlady She was an elderly quieteyed woman and had served more than
one generation of young people with their teas

They returned home by train Joan insisted on travelling third class
and selected a compartment containing a stout woman and two children
Arthur had to be at the works An important contract had got behindhand
and they were working overtime She and her father dined alone He made
her fulfil her promise to talk about herself and she told him all she
thought would interest him She passed lightly over her acquaintanceship
with Phillips He would regard it as highly undesirable she told
herself and it would trouble him He was reading her articles in the
_Sunday Post_ as also her Letters from Clorinda and of the two
preferred the latter as being less subversive of law and order Also he
did not like seeing her photograph each week displayed across two
columns with her name beneath in one inch type He supposed he was old
fashioned She was getting rather tired of it herself

The Editor insisted upon it she explained It was worth it for the
opportunity it gives me I preach every Sunday to a congregation of over
a million souls Its better than being a Bishop Besides she added
the men are just as bad You see their silly faces everywhere

Thats like you women he answered with a smile You pretend to be
superior and then you copy us

She laughed But the next moment she was serious

No we dont she said not those of us who think We know we shall
never oust man from his place He will always be the greater We want
to help him thats all

But wasnt that the Lords idea he said when He gave Eve to Adam to
be his helpmeet

Yes that was all right she answered He fashioned Eve for Adam and
saw that Adam got her The ideal marriage might have been the ideal
solution If the Lord had intended that he should have kept the match
making in His own hands not have left it to man Somewhere in Athens
there must have been the helpmeet God had made for Socrates When they
met it was Xanthippe that she kissed

A servant brought the coffee and went out again Her father lighted a
cigar and handed her the cigarettes

Will it shock you Dad she asked

Rather late in the day for you to worry yourself about that isnt it
he answered with a smile

He struck a match and held it for her Joan sat with her elbows on the
table and smoked in silence She was thinking

Why had he never brought her up never exacted obedience from her
never even tried to influence her It could not have been mere weakness
She stole a sidelong glance at the tired lined face with its steelblue
eyes She had never seen them other than calm but they must have been
able to flash Why had he always been so just and kind and patient with
her Why had he never scolded her and bullied her and teased her Why
had he let her go away leaving him lonely in his empty voiceless house
Why had he never made any claim upon her The idea came to her as an
inspiration At least it would ease her conscience Why dont you let
Arthur live here she said instead of going back to his lodgings It
would be company for you

He did not answer for some time She had begun to wonder if he had
heard

What do you think of him he said without looking at her

Oh hes quite a nice lad she answered

It was some while again before he spoke He will be the last of the
Allways he said I should like to think of the name being continued
and hes a good business man in spite of his dreaminess Perhaps he
would get on better with the men

She seized at the chance of changing the subject

It was a foolish notion she said that of the Manchester school that
men and women could be treated as mere figures in a sum

To her surprise he agreed with her The feudal system had a fine idea
in it he said if it had been honestly carried out A master should
be the friend the helper of his men They should be one family

She looked at him a little incredulously remembering the bitter periods
of strikes and lockouts

Did you ever try Dad she asked

Oh yes he answered But I tried the wrong way The right way
might be found he added by the right man and woman

She felt that he was watching her through his halfclosed eyes There
are those cottages he continued just before you come to the bridge
They might be repaired and a club house added The idea is catching on
they tell me Garden villages they call them now It gets the men and
women away from the dirty streets and gives the children a chance

She knew the place A sad group of dilapidated little houses forming
three sides of a paved quadrangle with a shattered fountain and withered
trees in the centre Ever since she could remember they had stood there
empty ghostly with creaking doors and broken windows their gardens
overgrown with weeds

Are they yours she asked She had never connected them with the
works some half a mile away Though had she been curious she might
have learnt that they were known as Allways Folly

Your mothers he answered I built them the year I came back from
America and gave them to her I thought it would interest her Perhaps
it would if I had left her to her own ways

Why didnt they want them she asked

They did at first he answered The timeservers and the hypocrites
among them I made it a condition that they should be teetotallers and
chapel goers and everything else that I thought good for them I
thought that I could save their souls by bribing them with cheap rents
and share of profits And then the Union came and that of course
finished it

So he too had thought to build Jerusalem

Yes he said Ill sound him about giving up his lodgings

Joan lay awake for a long while that night The moon looked in at the
window It seemed to have got itself entangled in the tops of the tall
pines Would it not be her duty to come backmake her father happy to
say nothing of the other He was a dear sweet lovable lad Together
they might realize her fathers dream repair the blunders plant gardens
where the weeds now grew drive out the old sad ghosts with living
voices It had been a fine thought a Kings thought Others had
followed profiting by his mistakes But might it not be carried further
than even they had gone shaped into some noble venture that should serve
the future

Was not her America here Why seek it further What was this unknown
Force that against all sense and reason seemed driving her out into
the wilderness to preach Might it not be mere vanity mere egoism
Almost she had convinced herself

And then there flashed remembrance of her mother She too had laid
aside herself had thought that love and duty could teach one to be other
than one was The Ego was the all important thing entrusted to us as
the talents of silver to the faithful servant to be developed not for
our own purposes but for the service of the Master

One did no good by suppressing ones nature In the end it proved too
strong Marriage with Arthur would be only repeating the mistake To be
worshipped to be served It would be very pleasant when one was in the
mood But it would not satisfy her There was something strong and
fierce and primitive in her naturesomething that had come down to her
through the generations from some harnessgirded ancestresssomething
impelling her instinctively to choose the fighter to share with him the
joy of battle healing his wounds giving him of her courage exulting
with him in the victory

The moon had risen clear of the entangling pines It rode serene and
free

Her father came to the station with her in the morning The train was
not in and they walked up and down and talked Suddenly she remembered
it had slipped her mind

Could I as a child have known an old clergyman she asked him At
least he wouldnt have been old then I dropped into Chelsea Church one
evening and heard him preach and on the way home I passed him again in
the street It seemed to me that I had seen his face before But not
for many years I meant to write you about it but forgot

He had to turn aside for a moment to speak to an acquaintance about
business

Oh its possible he answered on rejoining her What was his name

I do not know she answered He was not the regular Incumbent But
it was someone that I seemed to know quite wellthat I must have been
familiar with

It may have been he answered carelessly though the gulf was wider
then than it is now Ill try and think Perhaps it is only your
fancy

The train drew in and he found her a corner seat and stood talking by
the window about common things

What did he preach about he asked her unexpectedly

She was puzzled for the moment Oh the old clergyman she answered
recollecting Oh Calvary All roads lead to Calvary he thought It
was rather interesting

She looked back at the end of the platform He had not moved




CHAPTER IX


A pile of correspondence was awaiting her and standing by the desk she
began to open and read it Suddenly she paused conscious that someone
had entered the room and turning she saw Hilda She must have left the
door ajar for she had heard no sound The child closed the door
noiselessly and came across holding out a letter

Papa told me to give you this the moment you came in she said Joan
had not yet taken off her things The child must have been keeping a
close watch Save for the signature it contained but one line I have
accepted

Joan replaced the letter in its envelope and laid it down upon the desk
Unconsciously a smile played about her lips

The child was watching her Im glad you persuaded him she said

Joan felt a flush mount to her face She had forgotten Hilda for the
instant

She forced a laugh Oh I only persuaded him to do what he had made up
his mind to do she explained It was all settled

No it wasnt answered the child Most of them were against it And
then there was Mama she added in a lower tone

What do you mean asked Joan Didnt she wish it

The child raised her eyes There was a dull anger in them Oh whats
the good of pretending she said Hes so great He could be the
Prime Minister of England if he chose But then he would have to visit
kings and nobles and receive them at his house and Mama She broke
off with a passionate gesture of the small thin hands

Joan was puzzled what to say She knew exactly what she ought to say
what she would have said to any ordinary child But to say it to this
uncannily knowing little creature did not promise much good

Who told you I persuaded him she asked

Nobody answered the child I knew

Joan seated herself and drew the child towards her

It isnt as terrible as you think she said Many men who have risen
and taken a high place in the world were married to kind good women
unable to share their greatness There was Shakespeare you know who
married Anne Hathaway and had a clever daughter She was just a nice
homely body a few years older than himself And he seems to have been
very fond of her and was always running down to Stratford to be with
her

Yes but he didnt bring her up to London answered the child Mama
would have wanted to come and Papa would have let her and wouldnt have
gone to see Queen Elizabeth unless she had been invited too

Joan wished she had not mentioned Shakespeare There had surely been
others men who had climbed up and carried their impossible wives with
them But she couldnt think of one just then

We must help her she answered somewhat lamely Shes anxious to
learn I know

The child shook her head She doesnt understand she said And Papa
wont tell her He says it would only hurt her and do no good The
small hands were clenched I shall hate her if she spoils his life

The atmosphere was becoming tragic Joan felt the need of escaping from
it She sprang up

Oh dont be nonsensical she said Your father isnt the only man
married to a woman not as clever as himself He isnt going to let that
stop him And your mothers going to learn to be the wife of a great man
and do the best she can And if they dont like her theyve got to put
up with her I shall talk to the both of them A wave of motherliness
towards the entire Phillips family passed over her It included Hilda
She caught the child to her and gave her a hug You go back to school
she said and get on as fast as you can so that youll be able to be
useful to him

The child flung her arms about her Youre so beautiful and wonderful
she said You can do anything Im so glad you came

Joan laughed It was surprising how easily the problem had been solved
She would take Mrs Phillips in hand at once At all events she should
be wholesome and unobtrusive It would be a delicate mission but Joan
felt sure of her own tact She could see his boyish eyes turned upon her
with wonder and gratitude

I was so afraid you would not be back before I went said the child I
ought to have gone this afternoon but Papa let me stay till the
evening

You will help she added fixing on Joan her great grave eyes

Joan promised and the child went out She looked pretty when she
smiled She closed the door behind her noiselessly

It occurred to Joan that she would like to talk matters over with
Greyson There was Clorindas attitude to be decided upon and she was
interested to know what view he himself would take Of course he would
be on Ps side The _Evening Gazette_ had always supported the gas
and water school of socialism and to include the peoples food was
surely only an extension of the principle She rang him up and Miss
Greyson answered asking her to come round to dinner they would be
alone And she agreed

The Greysons lived in a small house squeezed into an angle of the Outer
Circle overlooking Regents Park It was charmingly furnished chiefly
with old Chippendale The drawingroom made quite a picture It was
homelike and restful with its faded colouring and absence of all show
and overcrowding They sat there after dinner and discussed Joans news
Miss Greyson was repairing a piece of old embroidery she had brought back
with her from Italy and Greyson sat smoking with his hands behind his
head and his long legs stretched out towards the fire

Carleton will want him to make his food policy include Tariff Reform
he said If he prove pliable and is willing to throw over his free
trade principles all well and good

Whats Carleton got to do with it demanded Joan with a note of
indignation

He turned his head towards her with an amused raising of the eyebrows
Carleton owns two London dailies he answered and is in treaty for a
third together with a dozen others scattered about the provinces Most
politicians find themselves sooner or later convinced by his arguments
Phillips may prove the exception

It would be rather interesting a fight between them said Joan
Myself I should back Phillips

He might win through mused Greyson Hes the man to do it if
anybody could But the odds will be against him

I dont see it said Joan with decision

Im afraid you havent yet grasped the power of the Press he answered
with a smile Phillips speaks occasionally to five thousand people
Carleton addresses every day a circle of five million readers

Yes but when Phillips does speak he speaks to the whole country
retorted Joan

Through the medium of Carleton and his like and just so far as they
allow his influence to permeate beyond the platform answered Greyson

But they report his speeches They are bound to explained Joan

It doesnt read quite the same he answered Phillips goes home under
the impression that he has made a great success and has roused the
country He and millions of other readers learn from the next mornings
headlines that it was A Tame Speech that he made What sounded to him
Loud Cheers have sunk to mild Hear Hears That five minutes
hurricane of applause during which wildly excited men and women leapt
upon the benches and roared themselves hoarse and which he felt had
settled the whole question he searches for in vain A few silly
interjections probably prearranged by Carletons young lions become
renewed interruptions The report is strictly truthful but the
impression produced is that Robert Phillips has failed to carry even his
own people with him And then follow leaders in fourteen
widelycirculated Dailies stretching from the Clyde to the Severn
foretelling how Mr Robert Phillips could regain his waning popularity by
the simple process of adopting Tariff Reform or whatever the pet panacea
of Carleton and Co may at the moment happen to be

Dont make us out all alike pleaded his sister with a laugh There
are still a few oldfashioned papers that do give their opponents fair
play

They are not increasing in numbers he answered and the Carleton
group is There is no reason why in another ten years he should not
control the entire popular press of the country Hes got the genius and
hes got the means

The cleverest thing he has done he continued turning to Joan is
your _Sunday Post_ Up till then the working classes had escaped him
With the _Sunday Post_ he has solved the problem They open their
mouths and he gives them their politics wrapped up in pictures and
gossipy pars

Miss Greyson rose and put away her embroidery But whats his object
she said He must have more money than he can spend and he works like
a horse I could understand it if he had any beliefs

Oh we can all persuade ourselves that we are the Heavenordained
dictator of the human race he answered Love of power is at the
bottom of it Why do our Rockefellers and our Carnegies condemn
themselves to the existence of galley slaves ruining their digestions so
that they never can enjoy a square meal It isnt the money its the
trouble of their lives how to get rid of that It is the notoriety the
power that they are out for In Carletons case it is to feel himself
the power behind the throne to know that he can make and unmake
statesmen has the keys of peace and war in his pocket is able to
exclaim Public opinion It is I

It can be a respectable ambition suggested Joan

It has been responsible for most of mans miseries he answered Every
worlds conqueror meant to make it happy after he had finished knocking
it about We are all born with it thanks to the devil He shifted his
position and regarded her with critical eyes Youve got it badly he
said I can see it in the tilt of your chin and the quivering of your
nostrils You beware of it

Miss Greyson left them She had to finish an article They debated
Clorindas views and agreed that as a practical housekeeper she
would welcome attention being given to the question of the nations food
The _Evening Gazette_ would support Phillips in principle while
reserving to itself the right of criticism when it came to details

Whats he like in himself he asked her Youve been seeing something
of him havent you

Oh a little she answered Hes absolutely sincere and he means
business He wont stop at the bottom of the ladder now hes once got
his foot upon it

But hes quite common isnt he he asked again Ive only met him in
public

No thats precisely what he isnt answered Joan You feel that he
belongs to no class but his own The class of the Abraham Lincolns and
the Dantons

Englands a different proposition he mused Society counts for so
much with us I doubt if we should accept even an Abraham Lincoln
unless in some supreme crisis His wife rather handicaps him too
doesnt she

She wasnt born to be the chatelaine of Downing Street Joan admitted
But its not an official position

Im not so sure that it isnt he laughed Its the dinnertable that
rules in England We settle everything round a dinnertable

She was sitting in front of the fire in a highbacked chair She never
cared to loll and the shaded light from the electric sconces upon the
mantelpiece illumined her

If the world were properly stagemanaged thats what you ought to be
he said the wife of a Prime Minister I can see you giving such an
excellent performance

I must talk to Mary he added see if we cant get you off on some
promising young Under Secretary

Dont give me ideas above my station laughed Joan Im a
journalist

Thats the pity of it he said Youre wasting the most important
thing about you your personality You would do more good in a drawing
room influencing the rulers than you will ever do hiding behind a pen
It was the drawingroom that made the French Revolution

The firelight played about her hair I suppose every woman dreams of
reviving the old French Salon she answered They must have been
gloriously interesting He was leaning forward with clasped hands Why
shouldnt she he said The reason that our drawingrooms have ceased
to lead is that our beautiful women are generally frivolous and our
clever women unfeminine What we are waiting for is an English Madame
Roland

Joan laughed Perhaps I shall some day she answered

He insisted on seeing her as far as the bus It was a soft mild night
and they walked round the Circle to Gloucester Gate He thought there
would be more room in the buses at that point

I wish you would come oftener he said Mary has taken such a liking
to you If you care to meet people we can always whip up somebody of
interest

She promised that she would She always felt curiously at home with the
Greysons

They were passing the long sweep of Chester Terrace I like this
neighbourhood with its early Victorian atmosphere she said It always
makes me feel quiet and good I dont know why

I like the houses too he said Theres a character about them You
dont often find such fine drawingrooms in London

Dont forget your promise he reminded her when they parted I shall
tell Mary she may write to you

She met Carleton by chance a day or two later as she was entering the
office I want to see you he said and took her up with him into his
room

We must stir the people up about this food business he said plunging
at once into his subject Phillips is quite right It overshadows
everything We must make the country selfsupporting It can be done
and must If a war were to be sprung upon us we could be starved out in
a month Our navy in face of these new submarines is no longer able to
secure us France is working day and night upon them It may be a
bogey or it may not If it isnt she would have us at her mercy and
its too big a risk to run You live in the same house with him dont
you Do you often see him

Not often she answered

He was reading a letter You were dining there on Friday night werent
you he asked her without looking up

Joan flushed What did he mean by crossexamining her in this way She
was not at all used to impertinence from the opposite sex

Your information is quite correct she answered

Her anger betrayed itself in her tone and he shot a swift glance at her

I didnt mean to offend you he said A mutual friend a Mr Airlie
happened to be of the party and he mentioned you

He threw aside the letter Ill tell you what I want you to do he
said Its nothing to object to Tell him that youve seen me and had
a talk I understand his scheme to be that the country should grow more
and more food until it eventually becomes selfsupporting and that the
Government should control the distribution Tell him that with that Im
heart and soul in sympathy and would like to help him He pushed aside
a pile of papers and leaning across the desk spoke with studied
deliberation If he can see his way to making his policy dependent upon
Protection we can work together

And if he cant suggested Joan

He fixed his large colourless eyes upon her Thats where you can help
him he answered If he and I combine forces we can pull this through
in spite of the furious opposition that it is going to arouse Without a
good Press he is helpless and where is he going to get his Press backing
if he turns me down From half a dozen Socialist papers whose support
will do him more harm than good If he will bring the working class over
to Protection I will undertake that the Tariff Reformers and the
Agricultural Interest shall accept his Socialism It will be a victory
for both of us

If he gain his end what do the means matter he continued as Joan did
not answer Food may be dearer the Unions can square that by putting
up wages while the poor devil of a farm labourer will at last get fair
treatment We can easily insist upon that What do you think
yourself

About Protection she answered Its one of the few subjects I
havent made up my mind about

He laughed You will find all your pet reforms depend upon it when you
come to work them out he said You cant have a minimum wage without
a minimum price

They had risen

Ill give him your message said Joan But I dont see him exchanging
his principles even for your support I admit its important

Talk it over with him he said And bear this in mind for your own
guidance He took a step forward which brought his face quite close to
hers If he fails and all his lifes work goes for nothing I shall be
sorry but I shant break my heart He will

Joan dropped a note into Phillipss letterbox on her return home saying
briefly that she wished to see him and he sent up answer asking her if
she would come to the gallery that evening and meet him after his
speech which would be immediately following the dinner hour

It was the first time he had risen since his appointment and he was
received with general cheers He stood out curiously youthful against
the background of greyhaired and baldheaded men behind him and there
was youth also in his clear ringing voice that not even the vaultlike
atmosphere of that shadowless chamber could altogether rob of its
vitality He spoke simply and goodhumouredly without any attempt at
rhetoric relying chiefly upon a crescendo of telling facts that
gradually as he proceeded roused the House to that tense stillness that
comes to it when it begins to think

A distinctly dangerous man Joan overheard a little old lady behind her
comment to a friend If I didnt hate him I should like him

He met her in the corridor and they walked up and down and talked too
absorbed to be aware of the curious eyes that were turned upon them Joan
gave him Carletons message

It was clever of him to make use of you he said If hed sent it
through anybody else Id have published it

You dont think it even worth considering suggested Joan

Protection he flashed out scornfully Yes Ive heard of that Ive
listened as a boy while the old men told of it to one another in thin
piping voices round the fireside how the labourers were flung eightand
sixpence a week to die on and the men starved in the towns while the
farmers kept their hunters and got drunk each night on fine old crusted
port Do you know what their toast was in the big hotels on market day
with the windows open to the street To a long war and a bloody one It
would be their toast tomorrow if they had their way Does he think I
am going to be a party to the putting of the peoples neck again under
their pitiless yoke

But the people are more powerful now argued Joan If the farmer
demanded higher prices they could demand higher wages

They would never overtake the farmer he answered with a laugh And
the last word would always be with him I am out to get rid of the
landlords he continued not to establish them as the permanent rulers
of the country as they are in Germany The people are more
powerfuljust a little because they are no longer dependent on the
land They can say to the farmer All right my son if thats your
figure Im going to the shop next doorto South America to Canada to
Russia It isnt a satisfactory solution I want to see England happy
and healthy before I bother about the Argentine It drives our men into
the slums when they might be living fine lives in Gods fresh air In
the case of war it might be disastrous There I agree with him We
must be able to shut our door without fear of having to open it ourselves
to ask for bread How would Protection accomplish that Did he tell
you

Dont eat me laughed Joan I havent been sent to you as a
missionary Im only a humble messenger I suppose the argument is
that good profits assured to him the farmer would bustle up and produce
more

Can you see him bustling up he answered with a laugh organizing
himself into a body and working the thing out from the point of view of
the public weal Ill tell you what ninetenths of him would do grow
just as much or little as suited his own purposes and then go to sleep
And Protection would be his security against ever being awakened

Im afraid you dont like him Joan commented

He will be all right in his proper place he answered as the servant
of the public told what to do and turned out of his job if he doesnt
do it My scheme does depend upon Protection You can tell him that
But this time its going to be Protection for the people

They were at the far end of the corridor and the few others still
promenading were some distance away She had not delivered the whole of
her message She crossed to a seat and he followed her She spoke with
her face turned away from him

You have got to consider the cost of refusal she said His offer
wasnt help or neutrality it was help or opposition by every means in
his power He left me in no kind of doubt as to that Hes not used to
being challenged and he wont be squeamish You will have the whole of
his Press against you and every other journalistic and political
influence that he possesses Hes getting a hold upon the working
classes The _Sunday Post_ has an enormous sale in the manufacturing
towns and hes talking of starting another Are you strong enough to
fight him

She very much wanted to look at him but she would not It seemed to her
quite a time before he replied

Yes he answered Im strong enough to fight him Shall rather enjoy
doing it And its time that somebody did Whether Im strong enough to
win has got to be seen

She turned and looked at him then She wondered why she had ever thought
him ugly

You can face it she said the possibility of all your lifes work
being wasted

It wont be wasted he answered The land is there Ive seen it
from afar and its a good land a land where no man shall go hungry If
not I another shall lead the people into it I shall have prepared the
way

She liked him for that touch of exaggeration She was so tired of the
men who make out all things little including themselves and their own
work After all was it exaggeration Might he not have been chosen to
lead the people out of bondage to a land where there should be no more
fear

Youre not angry with me he asked I havent been rude have I

Abominably rude she answered youve defied my warnings and treated
my embassy with contempt She turned to him and their eyes met I
should have despised you if you hadnt she added

There was a note of exultation in her voice and as if in answer
something leapt into his eyes that seemed to claim her Perhaps it was
well that just then the bell rang for a division and the moment passed

He rose and held out his hand We will fight him he said And you
can tell him this if he asks that Im going straight for him
Parliament may as well close down if a few men between them are to be
allowed to own the entire Press of the country and stifle every voice
that does not shout their bidding We havent dethroned kings to put up
a newspaper Boss He shall have all the fighting he wants

They met more often from that day for Joan was frankly using her two
columns in the _Sunday Post_ to propagate his aims Carleton to her
surprise made no objection Nor did he seek to learn the result of his
ultimatum It looked they thought as if he had assumed acceptance and
was willing for Phillips to choose his own occasion Meanwhile replies
to her articles reached Joan in weekly increasing numbers There seemed
to be a wind arising blowing towards Protection Farm labourers
especially appeared to be enthusiastic for its coming From their ill
spelt smeared epistles one gathered that after years of doubt and
hesitation they hadhowever reluctantlyarrived at the conclusion that
without it there could be no hope for them Factory workers miners
engineersmore fluent less apologeticwrote as strong supporters of
Phillipss scheme but saw clearly how upon Protection its success
depended Shopmen clerksonly occasionally ungrammaticalfelt sure
that Robert Phillips the tried friend of the poor would insist upon the
boon of Protection being no longer held back from the people Wives and
mothers claimed it as their childrens birthright Similar views got
themselves at the same time into the correspondence columns of
Carletons other numerous papers Evidently Democracy had been throbbing
with a passion for Protection hitherto unknown even to itself

He means it kindly laughed Phillips He is offering me an excuse to
surrender gracefully We must have a public meeting or two after
Christmas and clear the ground They had got into the habit of
speaking in the plural

Mrs Phillipss conversion Joan found more difficult than she had
anticipated She had persuaded Phillips to take a small house and let
her furnish it upon the hire system Joan went with her to the widely
advertised Emporium in the City Road meaning to advise her But in
the end she gave it up out of sheer pity Nor would her advice have
served much purpose confronted by the rich and varied choice provided
for his patrons by Mr Krebs the Furnisher for Connoisseurs

Weve never had a home exactly explained Mrs Phillips during their
journey in the tram Its always been lodgings up to now Nice
enough some of them but you know what I mean everybody elses taste
but your own Ive always fancied a little house with ones own things
in it You know things that you can get fond of

Oh the things she was going to get fond of The things that her poor
round foolish eyes gloated upon the moment that she saw them Joan tried
to enlist the shopman on her side descending even to flirtation
Unfortunately he was a young man with a high sense of duty convinced
that his employers interests lay in his support of Mrs Phillips The
sight of the furniture that between them they selected for the dining
room gave Joan a quite distinct internal pain They ascended to the
floor above devoted to the exhibition of _Recherche_ drawingroom
suites Mrs Phillipss eye instinctively fastened with passionate
desire upon the most atrocious Joan grew vehement It was impossible

I always was a one for cheerful colours explained Mrs Phillips

Even the shopman wavered Joan pressed her advantage directed Mrs
Phillipss attention to something a little less awful Mrs Phillips
yielded

Of course you know best dear she admitted Perhaps I am a bit too
fond of bright things

The victory was won Mrs Phillips had turned away The shopman was
altering the order Joan moved towards the door and accidentally caught
sight of Mrs Phillipss face The flabby mouth was trembling A tear
was running down the painted cheek

Joan slipped her hand through the others arm

Im not so sure youre not right after all she said fixing a critical
eye upon the rival suites It is a bit mousey that other

The order was once more corrected Joan had the consolation of
witnessing the childish delight that came again into the foolish face
but felt angry with herself at her own weakness

It was the womans feebleness that irritated her If only she had shown
a spark of fight Joan could have been firm Poor feckless creature
what could have ever been her attraction for Phillips

She followed inwardly fuming while Mrs Phillips continued to pile
monstrosity upon monstrosity What would Phillips think And what would
Hildas eyes say when they looked upon that _recherche_ drawingroom
suite Hilda who would have had no sentimental compunctions The woman
would be sure to tell them both that she Joan had accompanied her and
helped in the choosing The whole ghastly house would be exhibited to
every visitor as the result of their joint taste She could hear Mr
Airlies purring voice congratulating her

She ought to have insisted on their going to a decent shop The mere
advertisement ought to have forewarned her It was the posters that had
captured Mrs Phillips those dazzling apartments where bejewelled
society reposed upon the highclass but inexpensive designs of Mr
Krebs Artists ought to have more selfrespect than to sell their
talents for such purposes

The contract was concluded in Mr Krebs private office a very stout
gentleman with a very thin voice whose dream had always been to one day
be of service to the renowned Mr Robert Phillips He was clearly under
the impression that he had now accomplished it Even as Mrs Phillips
took up the pen to sign the wild idea occurred to Joan of snatching the
paper away from her hustling her into a cab and in some quiet street or
square making the woman see for herself that she was a useless fool that
the glowing dreams and fancies she had cherished in her silly head for
fifteen years must all be given up that she must stand aside knowing
herself of no account

It could be done She felt it If only one could summon up the needful
brutality If only one could stifle that still small voice of Pity

Mrs Phillips signed amid splutterings and blots Joan added her
signature as witness

She did effect an improvement in the poor ladys dress On Madges
advice she took her to a voluble little woman in the Earls Court Road
who was struck at once by Madame Phillipss remarkable resemblance to the
Baroness von Stein Had not Joan noticed it Whatever suited the
Baroness von Steinallowed by common consent to be one of the
bestdressed women in Londonwas bound to show up Madame Phillips to
equal advantage By curious coincidence a costume for the Baroness had
been put in hand only the day before It was sent for and pinned upon
the delighted Madame Phillips Perfection As the Baroness herself
would always say My frock must be a framework for my personality It
must never obtrude The supremely welldressed woman One never
notices what she has on that is the test It seemed it was what Mrs
Phillips had always felt herself Joan could have kissed the voluble
emphatic little woman

But the dyed hair and the paint put up a fight for themselves

I want you to do something very brave said Joan She had invited
herself to tea with Mrs Phillips and they were alone in the small white
panelled room that they were soon to say goodbye to The new house
would be ready at Christmas It will be a little hard at first
continued Joan but afterwards you will be glad that you have done it
It is a duty you owe to your position as the wife of a great leader of
the people

The firelight showed to Joan a comically frightened face with round
staring eyes and an open mouth

What is it you want me to do she faltered

I want you to be just yourself said Joan a kind good woman of the
people who will win their respect and set them an example She moved
across and seating herself on the arm of Mrs Phillipss chair touched
lightly with her hand the flaxen hair and the rouged cheek I want you
to get rid of all this she whispered It isnt worthy of you Leave
it to the silly dolls and the bad women

There was a long silence Joan felt the tears trickling between her
fingers

You havent seen me came at last in a thin broken voice

Joan bent down and kissed her Lets try it she whispered

A little choking sound was the only answer But the woman rose and Joan
following they stole upstairs into the bedroom and Mrs Phillips turned
the key

It took a long time and Joan seated on the bed remembered a night when
she had taken a trapped mouse if only he had been a quiet mouse into
the bathroom and had waited while it drowned It was finished at last
and Mrs Phillips stood revealed with her hair down showing streaks of
dingy brown

Joan tried to enthuse but the words came haltingly She suggested to
Joan a candle that some wind had suddenly blown out The paint and
powder had been obvious but at least it had given her the mask of youth
She looked old and withered The life seemed to have gone out of her

You see dear I began when I was young she explained and he has
always seen me the same I dont think I could live like this

The painted doll that the child fancied the paint washed off and the
golden hair all turned to drab Could one be sure of getting used to
it of liking it better And the poor bewildered doll itself How
could one expect to make of it a statue The Woman of the People One
could only bruise it

It ended in Joans promising to introduce her to discreet theatrical
friends who would tell her of cosmetics less injurious to the skin and
advise her generally in the ancient and proper art of making up

It was not the end she had looked for Joan sighed as she closed her
door behind her What was the meaning of it On the one hand that
unimpeachable law the greatest happiness of the greatest number the
sacred cause of Democracy the moral Uplift of the people Sanity
Wisdom Truth the higher Justice all the forces on which she was
relying for the regeneration of the worldall arrayed in stern demand
that the flabby useless Mrs Phillips should be sacrificed for the
general good Only one voice had pleaded for foolish helpless Mrs
Phillipsand had conquered The still small voice of Pity




CHAPTER X


Arthur sprang himself upon her a little before Christmas He was full of
a great project It was that she and her father should spend Christmas
with his people at Birmingham Her father thought he would like to see
his brother they had not often met of late and Birmingham would be
nearer for her than Liverpool

Joan had no intention of being lured into the Birmingham parlour She
thought she could see in it a scheme for her gradual entanglement
Besides she was highly displeased She had intended asking her father
to come to Brighton with her As a matter of fact she had forgotten all
about Christmas and the idea only came into her head while explaining to
Arthur how his impulsiveness had interfered with it Arthur
crestfallen suggested telegrams It would be quite easy to alter
everything and of course her father would rather be with her wherever
it was But it seemed it was too late She ought to have been
consulted A sudden sense of proprietorship in her father came to her
assistance and added pathos to her indignation Of course now she
would have to spend Christmas alone She was far too busy to think of
Birmingham She could have managed Brighton Argument founded on the
length of journey to Birmingham as compared with the journey to Brighton
she refused to be drawn into Her feelings had been too deeply wounded
to permit of descent into detail

But the sinner confessing his fault is entitled to forgiveness and
having put him back into his proper place she let him kiss her hand She
even went further and let him ask her out to dinner As the result of
her failure to reform Mrs Phillips she was feeling dissatisfied with
herself It was an unpleasant sensation and somewhat new to her
experience An evening spent in Arthurs company might do her good The
experiment proved successful He really was quite a dear boy Eyeing
him thoughtfully through the smoke of her cigarette it occurred to her
how like he was to Guidos painting of St Sebastian those soft dreamy
eyes and that beautiful almost feminine face There always had been a
suspicion of the saint about him even as a boy nothing one could lay
hold of just that odd suggestion of a shadow intervening between him and
the world

It seemed a favourable opportunity to inform him of that fixed
determination of hers neverin all probabilityto marry but to devote
her life to her work She was feeling very kindly towards him and was
able to soften her decision with touches of gentle regret He did not
appear in the least upset But thought that her duty might demand
later on that she should change her mind that was if fate should offer
her some noble marriage giving her wider opportunity

She was a little piqued at his unexpected attitude of aloofness What
did he mean by a noble marriageto a Duke or something of that sort

He did not think the candidature need be confined to Dukes though he had
no objection to a worthy Duke He meant any really great man who would
help her and whom she could help

She promised somewhat shortly to consider the matter whenever the
Duke or other class of nobleman should propose to her At present no
sign of him had appeared above the horizon Her own idea was that if
she lived long enough she would become a spinster Unless someone took
pity on her when she was old and decrepit and past her work

There was a little humorous smile about his mouth But his eyes were
serious and pleading

When shall I know that you are old and decrepit he asked

She was not quite sure She thought it would be when her hair was
greyor rather white She had been informed by experts that her
peculiar shade of hair went white not grey

I shall ask you to marry me when your hair is white he said May I

It did not suggest any overwhelming impatience Yes she answered In
case you havent married yourself and forgotten all about me

I shall keep you to your promise he said quite gravely

She felt the time had come to speak seriously I want you to marry
she said and be happy I shall be troubled if you dont

He was looking at her with those shy worshipping eyes of his that always
made her marvel at her own wonderfulness

It need not do that he answered It would be beautiful to be with
you always so that I might serve you But I am quite happy loving you
Let me see you now and then touch you and hear your voice

Behind her drawndown lids she offered up a little prayer that she might
always be worthy of his homage She didnt know it would make no
difference to him

She walked with him to Euston and saw him into the train He had given
up his lodgings and was living with her father at The Pines They were
busy on a plan for securing the cooperation of the workmen and she
promised to run down and hear all about it She would not change her
mind about Birmingham but sent everyone her love

She wished she had gone when it came to Christmas Day This feeling of
loneliness was growing upon her The Phillips had gone up north and the
Greysons to some relations of theirs swell country people in Hampshire
Flossie was on a sea voyage with Sam and his mother and even Madge had
been struck homesick It happened to be a Sunday too of all days in
the week and London in a drizzling rain was just about the limit She
worked till late in the afternoon but sitting down to her solitary cup
of tea she felt she wanted to howl From the basement came faint sounds
of laughter Her landlord and lady were entertaining guests If they
had not been she would have found some excuse for running down and
talking to them if only for a few minutes

Suddenly the vision of old Chelsea Church rose up before her with its
little motherly old pewopener She had so often been meaning to go and
see her again but something had always interfered She hunted through
her drawers and found a comparatively sobercoloured shawl and tucked it
under her cloak The service was just commencing when she reached the
church Mary Stopperton showed her into a seat and evidently remembered
her I want to see you afterwards she whispered and Mary Stopperton
had smiled and nodded The service with its need for being continually
upon the move bored her she was not in the mood for it And the
sermon preached by a young curate who had not yet got over his Oxford
drawl was uninteresting She had half hoped that the wheezy old
clergyman who had preached about Calvary on the evening she had first
visited the church would be there again She wondered what had become
of him and if it were really a fact that she had known him when she was
a child or only her fancy It was strange how vividly her memory of him
seemed to pervade the little church She had the feeling he was watching
her from the shadows She waited for Mary in the vestibule and gave her
the shawl making her swear on the big key of the church door that she
would wear it herself and not give it away The little old pewopeners
pink and white face flushed with delight as she took it and the thin
workworn hands fingered it admiringly But I may lend it she
pleaded

They turned up Church Street Joan confided to Mary what a rotten
Christmas she had had all by herself without a soul to speak to except
her landlady who had brought her meals and had been in such haste to get
away

I dont know what made me think of you she said Im so glad I did
She gave the little old lady a hug Mary laughed Where are you going
now dearie she asked

Oh I dont mind so much now answered Joan Now that Ive seen a
friendly face I shall go home and go to bed early

They walked a little way in silence Mary slipped her hand into Joans
You wouldnt care to come home and have a bit of supper with me would
you dearie she asked

Oh may I answered Joan

Marys hand gave Joans a little squeeze You wont mind if anybody
drops in she said They do sometimes of a Sunday evening

You dont mean a party asked Joan

No dear answered Mary Its only one or two who have nowhere else
to go

Joan laughed She thought she would be a fit candidate

You see it makes company for me explained Mary

Mary lived in a tiny house behind a strip of garden It stood in a
narrow side street between two publichouses and was covered with ivy
It had two windows above and a window and a door below The upstairs
rooms belonged to the churchwardens and were used as a storehouse for old
parish registers deemed of little value Mary Stopperton and her
bedridden husband lived in the two rooms below Mary unlocked the door
and Joan passed in and waited Mary lit a candle that was standing on a
bracket and turned to lead the way

Shall I shut the door suggested Joan

Mary blushed like a child that has been found out just as it was hoping
that it had not been noticed

It doesnt matter dearie she explained They know if they find it
open that Im in

The little room looked very cosy when Mary had made up the fire and
lighted the lamp She seated Joan in the worn horsehair easychair out
of which one had to be careful one did not slip on to the floor and
spread her handsome shawl over the back of the dilapidated sofa

You wont mind my running away for a minute she said I shall only
be in the next room

Through the thin partition Joan heard a constant shrill complaining
voice At times it rose into an angry growl Mary looked in at the
door

Im just running round to the doctors she whispered His medicine
hasnt come I shant be long

Joan offered to go in and sit with the invalid But Mary feared the
exertion of talking might be too much for him He gets so excited she
explained She slipped out noiselessly

It seemed in spite of its open door a very silent little house behind
its strip of garden Joan had the feeling that it was listening

Suddenly she heard a light step in the passage and the room door opened
A girl entered She was wearing a large black hat and a black boa round
her neck Between them her face shone unnaturally white She carried a
small cloth bag She started on seeing Joan and seemed about to
retreat

Oh please dont go cried Joan Mrs Stopperton has just gone round
to the doctors She wont be long Im a friend of hers

The girl took stock of her and apparently reassured closed the door
behind her

Whats he like tonight she asked with a jerk of her head in the
direction of the next room She placed her bag carefully upon the sofa
and examined the new shawl as she did so

Well I gather hes a little fretful answered Joan with a smile

Thats a bad sign said the girl Means hes feeling better She
seated herself on the sofa and fingered the shawl Did you give it
her she asked

Yes admitted Joan I rather fancied her in it

Shell only pawn it said the girl to buy him grapes and port wine

I felt a bit afraid of her laughed Joan so I made her promise not to
part with it Is he really very ill her husband

Oh yes theres no makebelieve this time answered the girl A bad
thing for her if he wasnt

Oh its only whats known all over the neighbourhood continued the
girl Shes had a pretty rough time with him Twice Ive found her
getting ready to go to sleep for the night by sitting on the bare floor
with her back against the wall Had sold every stick in the place and
gone off But shed always some excuse for him It was sure to be half
her fault and the other half he couldnt help Now shes got her
reward according to her own account Heard he was dying in a
dosshouse and must fetch him home and nurse him back to life Seems
hes getting fonder of her every day Now that he cant do anything
else

It doesnt seem to depress her spirits mused Joan

Oh she Shes all right agreed the girl Having the time of her
life someone to look after for twentyfour hours a day that cant help
themselves

She examined Joan awhile in silence Are you on the stage she asked

No answered Joan But my mother was Are you

Thought you looked a bit like it said the girl Im in the chorus
Its better than being in service or in a shop thats all you can say
for it

But youll get out of that suggested Joan Youve got the actress
face

The girl flushed with pleasure It was a striking face with intelligent
eyes and a mobile sensitive mouth Oh yes she said I could act
all right I feel it But you dont get out of the chorus Except at a
price

Joan looked at her I thought that sort of thing was dying out she
said

The girl shrugged her shoulders Not in my shop she answered
Anyhow it was the only chance I ever had Wish sometimes Id taken it
It was quite a good part

They must have felt sure you could act said Joan Next time it will
be a clean offer

The girl shook her head Theres no next time she said once youre
put down as one of the standoffs Plenty of others to take your place

Oh I dont blame them she added It isnt a thing to be dismissed
with a toss of your head I thought it all out Dont know now what
decided me Something inside me I suppose

Joan found herself poking the fire Have you known Mary Stopperton
long she asked

Oh yes answered the girl Ever since Ive been on my own

Did you talk it over with her asked Joan

No answered the girl I may have just told her She isnt the sort
that gives advice

Im glad you didnt do it said Joan that you put up a fight for all
women

The girl gave a short laugh Afraid I wasnt thinking much about that
she said

No said Joan But perhaps thats the way the best fights are
foughtwithout thinking

Mary peeped round the door She had been lucky enough to find the doctor
in She disappeared again and they talked about themselves The girl
was a Miss Ensor She lived by herself in a room in Lawrence Street

Im not good at getting on with people she explained

Mary joined them and went straight to Miss Ensors bag and opened it
She shook her head at the contents which consisted of a small flabby
looking meat pie in a tin dish and two pale flat mince tarts

It doesnt nourish you dearie complained Mary You could have
bought yourself a nice bit of meat with the same money

And you would have had all the trouble of cooking it answered the
girl That only wants warming up

But I like cooking you know dearie grumbled Mary Theres no
interest in warming things up

The girl laughed You dont have to go far for your fun she said
Ill bring a sole next time and you shall do it _au gratin_

Mary put the indigestiblelooking pasties into the oven and almost
banged the door Miss Ensor proceeded to lay the table How many do
you think she asked Mary was doubtful She hoped that it being
Christmas Day they would have somewhere better to go

I passed old Bubble and Squeak just now spouting away to three men
and a dog outside the Worlds End I expect hell turn up thought Miss
Ensor She laid for four leaving space for more if need be I call it
the Cadgers Arms she explained turning to Joan We bring our own
victuals and Mary cooks them for us and waits on us and the more of us
the merrier You look forward to your Sunday evening parties dont
you she asked of Mary

Mary laughed She was busy in a corner with basins and a saucepan Of
course I do dearie she answered Ive always been fond of company

There came another opening of the door A little hairy man entered He
wore spectacles and was dressed in black He carried a paper parcel
which he laid upon the table He looked a little doubtful at Joan Mary
introduced them His name was Julius Simson He shook hands as if under
protest

As friends of Mary Stopperton he said we meet on neutral ground But
in all matters of moment I expect we are as far asunder as the poles I
stand for the People

We ought to be comrades answered Joan with a smile I too am
trying to help the People

You and your class said Mr Simson are friends enough to the People
so long as they remember that they are the People and keep their proper
placeat the bottom I am for putting the People at the top

Then they will be the Upper Classes suggested Joan And I may still
have to go on fighting for the rights of the lower orders

In this world explained Mr Simson someone has got to be Master The
only question is who

Mary had unwrapped the paper parcel It contained half a sheeps head
How would you like it done she whispered

Mr Simson considered There came a softer look into his eyes How did
you do it last time he asked It came up brown I remember with
thick gravy

Braised suggested Mary

Thats the word agreed Mr Simson Braised He watched while Mary
took things needful from the cupboard and commenced to peel an onion

Thats the sort that makes me despair of the People said Mr Simson
Joan could not be sure whether he was addressing her individually or
imaginary thousands Likes working for nothing Thinks she was born to
be everybodys servant He seated himself beside Miss Ensor on the
antiquated sofa It gave a complaining groan but held out

Did you have a good house the girl asked him Saw you from the
distance waving your arms about Hadnt time to stop

Not many admitted Mr Simson A Christmassy lot You know Sort of
crowd that interrupts you and tries to be funny Dead to their own
interests Its slow work

Why do you do it asked Miss Ensor

Damned if I know answered Mr Simson with a burst of candour Cant
help it I suppose Lost me job again

The old story suggested Miss Ensor

The old story sighed Mr Simson One of the customers happened to be
passing last Wednesday when I was speaking on the Embankment Heard my
opinion of the middle classes

Well you cant expect em to like it can you submitted Miss Ensor

No admitted Mr Simson with generosity Its only natural Its a
fight to the finish between me and the Bourgeois I cover them with
ridicule and contempt and they hit back at me in the only way they know

Take care they dont get the best of you Miss Ensor advised him

Oh Im not afraid he answered Ill get another place all right
give me time The only thing Im worried about is my young woman

Doesnt agree with you inquired Miss Ensor

Oh it isnt that he answered But shes frightened You know Says
life with me is going to be a bit too uncertain for her Perhaps shes
right

Oh why dont you chuck it advised Miss Ensor give the Bourgeois a
rest

Mr Simson shook his head Somebodys got to tackle them he said
Tell them the truth about themselves to their faces

Yes but it neednt be you suggested Miss Ensor

Mary was leaning over the table Miss Ensors fourpenny veal and ham
pie was ready Mary arranged it in front of her Eat it while its
hot dearie she counselled It wont be so indigestible

Miss Ensor turned to her Oh you talk to him she urged Here hes
lost his job again and is losing his girl all because of his silly
politics Tell him hes got to have sense and stop it

Mary seemed troubled Evidently as Miss Ensor had stated advice was
not her line Perhaps hes got to do it dearie she suggested

What do you mean by got to do it exclaimed Miss Ensor Whos making
him do it except himself

Mary flushed She seemed to want to get back to her cooking Its
something inside us dearie she thought that nobody hears but
ourselves

That tells him to talk all that twaddle demanded Miss Ensor Have
you heard him

No dearie Mary admitted But I expect its got its purpose Or he
wouldnt have to do it

Miss Ensor gave a gesture of despair and applied herself to her pie The
hirsute face of Mr Simson had lost the foolish aggressiveness that had
irritated Joan He seemed to be pondering matters

Mary hoped that Joan was hungry Joan laughed and admitted that she was
Its the smell of all the nice things she explained Mary promised it
should soon be ready and went back to her corner

A short dark thickset man entered and stood looking round the room
The frame must once have been powerful but now it was shrunken and
emaciated The shabby threadbare clothes hung loosely from the stooping
shoulders Only the head seemed to have retained its vigour The face
from which the long black hair was brushed straight back was ghastly
white Out of it deep set beneath great shaggy overhanging brows
blazed the fierce restless eyes of a fanatic The huge thinlipped
mouth seemed to have petrified itself into a savage snarl He gave Joan
the idea as he stood there glaring round him of a hunted beast at bay

Miss Ensor whose bump of reverence was undeveloped greeted him
cheerfully as Boanerges Mr Simson more respectful rose and offered
his small grimy hand Mary took his hat and cloak away from him and
closed the door behind him She felt his hands and put him into a chair
close to the fire And then she introduced him to Joan

Joan started on hearing his name It was one well known

The Cyril Baptiste she asked She had often wondered what he might be
like

The Cyril Baptiste he answered in a low even passionate voice that
he flung at her almost like a blow The atheist the gaol bird the
pariah the blasphemer the antiChrist Ive hoofs instead of feet
Shall I take off my boots and show them to you I tuck my tail inside my
coat You cant see my horns Ive cut them off close to my head
Thats why I wear my hair long to hide the stumps

Mary had been searching in the pockets of his cloak She had found a
paper bag You mustnt get excited she said laying her little work
worn hand upon his shoulder or youll bring on the bleeding

Aye he answered I must be careful I dont die on Christmas Day It
would make a fine text that for their sermons

He lapsed into silence his almost transparent hands stretched out
towards the fire

Mr Simson fidgeted The quiet of the room broken only by Marys
ministering activities evidently oppressed him

Paper going well sir he asked I often read it myself

It still sells answered the proprietor and editor and publisher and
entire staff of _The Rationalist_

I like the articles you are writing on the History of Superstition
Quite illuminating remarked Mr Simson

Its many a year I am afraid to the final chapter thought their
author

They afford much food for reflection thought Mr Simson though I
cannot myself go as far as you do in including Christianity under that
heading

Mary frowned at him but Mr Simson eager for argument or not noticing
blundered on

Whether we accept the miraculous explanation of Christs birth
continued Mr Simson in his best streetcorner voice or whether with
the great French writer whose name for the moment escapes me we regard
Him merely as a man inspired we must I think admit that His teaching
has been of help especially to the poor

The fanatic turned upon him so fiercely that Mr Simsons arm
involuntarily assumed the posture of defence

To the poor the old man almost shrieked To the poor that he has
robbed of all power of resistance to oppression by his vile submissive
creed that he has drugged into passive acceptance of every evil done to
them by his false promises that their sufferings here shall win for them
some wonderful reward when they are dead What has been his teaching to
the poor Bow your backs to the lash kiss the rod that scars your
flesh Be ye humble oh my people Be ye poor in spirit Let Wrong
rule triumphant through the world Raise no hand against it lest ye
suffer my eternal punishments Learn from me to be meek and lowly Learn
to be good slaves and give no trouble to your taskmasters Let them turn
the world into a hell for you The gravethe grave shall be your gate
to happiness

Helpful to the poor Helpful to their rulers to their owners They
take good care that Christ shall be well taught Their fat priests shall
bear his message to the poor The rod may be broken the prison door be
forced It is Christ that shall bind the people in eternal fetters
Christ the lackey the jackal of the rich

Mr Simson was visibly shocked Evidently he was less familiar with the
opinions of _The Rationalist_ than he had thought

I really must protest exclaimed Mr Simson To whatever wrong uses
His words may have been twisted Christ Himself I regard as divine and
entitled to be spoken of with reverence His whole life His
sufferings

But the old fanatics vigour had not yet exhausted itself

His sufferings he interrupted Does suffering entitle a man to be
regarded as divine If so so also am I a God Look at me He
stretched out his long thin arms with their clawlike hands thrusting
forward his great savage head that the bony wizened throat seemed hardly
strong enough to bear Wealth honour happiness I had them once I
had wife children and a home Now I creep an outcast keeping to the
shadows and the children in the street throw stones at me Thirty years
I have starved that I might preach They shut me in their prisons they
hound me into garrets They jibe at me and mock me but they cannot
silence me What of my life Am I divine

Miss Ensor having finished her supper sat smoking

Why must you preach she asked It doesnt seem to pay you There
was a curious smile about the girls lips as she caught Joans eye

He turned to her with his last flicker of passion

Because to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the
world that I should bear witness unto the truth he answered

He sank back a huddled heap upon the chair There was foam about his
mouth great beads of sweat upon his forehead Mary wiped them away with
a corner of her apron and felt again his trembling hands Oh please
dont talk to him any more she pleaded not till hes had his supper
She fetched her fine shawl and pinned it round him His eyes followed
her as she hovered about him For the first time since he had entered
the room they looked human

They gathered round the table Mr Baptiste was still pinned up in
Marys bright shawl It lent him a curious dignity He might have been
some ancient prophet stepped from the pages of the Talmud Miss Ensor
completed her supper with a cup of tea and some little cakes just to
keep us all company as Mary had insisted

The old fanatics eyes passed from face to face There was almost the
suggestion of a smile about the savage mouth

A strange supperparty he said Cyril the Apostate and Julius who
strove against the High Priests and the Pharisees and Inez a dancer
before the people and Joanna a daughter of the rulers gathered together
in the house of one Mary a servant of the Lord

Are you too a Christian he asked of Joan

Not yet answered Joan But I hope to be one day She spoke
without thinking not quite knowing what she meant But it came back to
her in after years

The talk grew lighter under the influence of Marys cooking Mr
Baptiste could be interesting when he got away from his fanaticism and
even the apostolic Mr Simson had sometimes noticed humour when it had
chanced his way

A message came for Mary about ten oclock brought by a scared little
girl who whispered it to her at the door Mary apologized She had to
go out The party broke up Mary disappeared into the next room and
returned in a shawl and bonnet carrying a small brown paper parcel Joan
walked with her as far as the Kings Road

A little child is coming she confided to Joan She was quite excited
about it

Joan thought Its curious she said one so seldom hears of anybody
being born on Christmas Day

They were passing a lamp Joan had never seen a face look quite so happy
as Marys looked just then

It always seems to me Christs birthday she said whenever a child is
born

They had reached the corner Joan could see her bus in the distance

She stooped and kissed the little withered face

Dont stop she whispered

Mary gave her a hug and almost ran away Joan watched the little child
like figure growing smaller It glided in and out among the people




CHAPTER XI


In the spring Joan at Mrs Dentons request undertook a mission It
was to go to Paris Mrs Denton had meant to go herself but was laid up
with sciatica and the matter she considered would not brook of any
delay

Its rather a delicate business she told Joan She was lying on a
couch in her great library and Joan was seated by her side I want
someone who can go into private houses and mix with educated people on
their own level and especially I want you to see one or two women they
count in France You know French pretty well dont you

Oh sufficiently Joan answered The one thing her mother had done for
her had been to talk French with her when she was a child and at Girton
she had chummed on with a French girl and made herself tolerably
perfect

You will not go as a journalist continued Mrs Denton but as a
personal friend of mine whose discretion I shall vouch for I want you
to find out what the people I am sending you among are thinking
themselves and what they consider ought to be done If we are not very
careful on both sides we shall have the newspapers whipping us into war

The perpetual Egyptian trouble had cropped up again and the Carleton
papers in particular were already sounding the tocsin Carletons
argument was that we ought to fall upon France and crush her before she
could develop her supposed submarine menace His flaming posters were at
every corner Every obscure French newspaper was being ransacked for
Insults and Pinpricks

A section of the Paris Press is doing all it can to help him of
course explained Mrs Denton It doesnt seem to matter to them that
Germany is only waiting her opportunity and that if Russia comes in it
is bound to bring Austria Europe will pay dearly one day for the luxury
of a free Press

But youre surely not suggesting any other kind of Press at this period
of the worlds history exclaimed Joan

Oh but I am answered the old lady with a grim tightening of the lips
Not even Carleton would be allowed to incite to murder or arson I
would have him prosecuted for inciting a nation to war

Why is the Press always so eager for war mused Joan According to
their own account war doesnt pay them

I dont suppose it does not directly answered Mrs Denton But it
helps them to establish their position and get a tighter hold upon the
public War does pay the newspaper in the long run The daily newspaper
lives on commotion crime lawlessness in general If people no longer
enjoyed reading about violence and bloodshed half their occupation and
that the most profitable half would be gone It is the interest of the
newspaper to keep alive the savage in human nature and war affords the
readiest means of doing this You cant do much to increase the number
of gruesome murders and loathsome assaults beyond giving all possible
advertisement to them when they do occur But you can preach war and
cover yourself with glory as a patriot at the same time

I wonder how many of my ideals will be left to me sighed Joan I
always used to regard the Press as the modern pulpit

The old pulpit became an evil the moment it obtained unlimited power
answered Mrs Denton It originated persecution and inflamed mens
passions against one another It too preached war for its own ends
taught superstition and punished thought as a crime The Press of to
day is stepping into the shoes of the medieval priest It aims at
establishing the worst kind of tyranny the tyranny over mens minds
They pretend to fight among themselves but its rapidly becoming a close
corporation The Institute of Journalists will soon be followed by the
Union of Newspaper Proprietors and the few independent journals will be
squeezed out Already we have German shareholders on English papers and
English capital is interested in the St Petersburg Press It will one
day have its International Pope and its school of cosmopolitan
cardinals

Joan laughed I can see Carleton rather fancying himself in a tiara
she said I must tell Phillips what you say Hes out for a fight with
him Government by Parliament or Government by Press is going to be his
war cry

Good man said Mrs Denton Im quite serious You tell him from me
that the next revolution has got to be against the Press And it will be
the stiffest fight Democracy has ever had

The old lady had tired herself Joan undertook the mission She thought
she would rather enjoy it and Mrs Denton promised to let her have full
instructions She would write to her friends in Paris and prepare them
for Joans coming

Joan remembered Folk the artist she had met at Flossies party who had
promised to walk with her on the terrace at St Germain and tell her
more about her mother She looked up his address on her return home and
wrote to him giving him the name of the hotel in the Rue de Grenelle
where Mrs Denton had arranged that she should stay She found a note
from him awaiting her when she arrived there He thought she would like
to be quiet after her journey He would call round in the morning He
had presumed on the privilege of age to send her some lilies They had
been her mothers favourite flower Monsieur Folk the great artist
had brought them himself and placed them in her dressingroom so Madame
informed her

It was one of the halfdozen old hotels still left in Paris and was
built round a garden famous for its mighty mulberry tree She
breakfasted underneath it and was reading there when Folk appeared
before her smiling and with his hat in his hand He excused himself for
intruding upon her so soon thinking from what she had written him that
her first morning might be his only chance He evidently considered her
remembrance of him a feather in his cap

We old fellows feel a little sadly at times how unimportant we are
he explained We are grateful when Youth throws us a smile

You told me my coming would take you back thirtythree years Joan
reminded him It makes us about the same age I shall treat you as
just a young man

He laughed Dont be surprised he said if I make a mistake
occasionally and call you Lena

Joan had no appointment till the afternoon They drove out to St
Germain and had _dejeuner_ at a small restaurant opposite the Chateau
and afterwards they strolled on to the terrace

What was my mother doing in Paris asked Joan

She was studying for the stage he answered Paris was the only
school in those days I was at Juliens studio We acted together for
some charity I had always been fond of it An American manager who was
present offered us both an engagement and I thought it would be a change
and that I could combine the two arts

And it was here that you proposed to her said Joan

Just by that tree that leans forward he answered pointing with his
cane a little way ahead I thought that in America Id get another
chance I might have if your father hadnt come along I wonder if he
remembers me

Did you ever see her again after her marriage asked Joan

No he answered We used to write to one another until she gave it
up She had got into the habit of looking upon me as a harmless sort of
thing to confide in and ask advice ofwhich she never took

Forgive me he said You must remember that I am still her lover
They had reached the tree that leant a little forward beyond its fellows
and he had halted and turned so that he was facing her Did she and
your father get on together Was she happy

I dont think she was happy answered Joan She was at first As a
child I can remember her singing and laughing about the house and she
liked always to have people about her Until her illness came It
changed her very much But my father was gentleness itself to the end

They had resumed their stroll It seemed to her that he looked at her
once or twice a little oddly without speaking What caused your
mothers illness he asked abruptly

The question troubled her It struck her with a pang of selfreproach
that she had always been indifferent to her mothers illness regarding
it as more or less imaginary It was mental rather than physical I
think she answered I never knew what brought it about

Again he looked at her with that odd inquisitive expression She never
got over it he asked

Oh there were times answered Joan when she was more like her old
self again But I dont think she ever quite got over it Unless it was
towards the end she added They told me she seemed much better for a
little while before she died I was away at Cambridge at the time

Poor dear lady he said all those years And poor Jack Allway He
seemed to be talking to himself Suddenly he turned to her How is the
dear fellow he asked

Again the question troubled her She had not seen her father since that
weekend nearly six months ago when she had ran down to see him because
she wanted something from him He felt my mothers death very deeply
she answered But hes well enough in health

Remember me to him he said And tell him I thank him for all those
years of love and gentleness I dont think he will be offended

He drove her back to Paris and she promised to come and see him in his
studio and let him introduce her to his artist friends

I shall try to win you over I warn you he said Politics will never
reform the world They appeal only to mens passions and hatreds They
divide us It is Art that is going to civilize mankind broaden his
sympathies Art speaks to him the common language of his loves his
dreams reveals to him the universal kinship

Mrs Dentons friends called upon her and most of them invited her to
their houses A few were politicians senators or ministers Others
were bankers heads of business houses literary men and women There
were also a few quiet folk with names that were historical They all
thought that war between France and England would be a world disaster
but were not very hopeful of averting it She learnt that Carleton was
in Berlin trying to secure possession of a wellknown German daily that
happened at the moment to be in low water He was working for an
alliance between Germany and England In France the Royalists had come
to an understanding with the Clericals and both were evidently making
ready to throw in their lot with the warmongers hoping that out of the
troubled waters the fish would come their way Of course everything
depended on the people If the people only knew it But they didnt
They stood about in puzzled flocks like sheep wondering which way the
newspaper dog was going to hound them They took her to the great music
halls Every allusion to war was greeted with rapturous applause The
Marseillaise was demanded and encored till the orchestra rebelled from
sheer exhaustion Joans patience was sorely tested She had to listen
with impassive face to coarse jests and brutal gibes directed against
England and everything English to sit unmoved while the vast audience
rocked with laughter at senseless caricatures of supposed English
soldiers whose knees always gave way at the sight of a French uniform
Even in the eyes of her courteous hosts Joans quick glance would
occasionally detect a curious glint The fools Had they never heard of
Waterloo and Trafalgar Even if their memories might be excused for
forgetting Crecy and Poictiers and the campaigns of Marlborough One
eveningit had been a particularly trying one for Joanthere stepped
upon the stage a woodenlooking man in a kilt with bagpipes under his
arm How he had got himself into the programme Joan could not
understand Managerial watchfulness must have gone to sleep for once He
played Scotch melodies and the Parisians liked them and when he had
finished they called him back Joan and her friends occupied a box close
to the stage The woodenlooking Scot glanced up at her and their eyes
met And as the applause died down there rose the first low warning
strains of the Pibroch Joan sat up in her chair and her lips parted
The savage music quickened It shrilled and skrealed The blood came
surging through her veins

And suddenly something lying hidden there leaped to life within her
brain A mad desire surged hold of her to rise and shout defiance at
those three thousand pairs of hostile eyes confronting her She clutched
at the arms of her chair and so kept her seat The pibroch ended with
its wild sad notes of wailing and slowly the mist cleared from her eyes
and the stage was empty A strange hush had fallen on the house

She was not aware that her hostess had been watching her She was a
sweetfaced whitehaired lady She touched Joan lightly on the hand
Thats the trouble she whispered Its in our blood

Could we ever hope to eradicate it Was not the survival of this
fighting instinct proof that war was still needful to us In the
sculptureroom of an exhibition she came upon a painted statue of
Bellona Its grotesqueness shocked her at first sight the red streaming
hair the wild eyes filled with fury the wide open mouthone could
almost hear it screamingthe white uplifted arms with outstretched
hands Appalling Terrible And yet as she gazed at it gradually the
thing grew curiously real to her She seemed to hear the gathering of
the chariots the neighing of the horses the hurrying of many feet the
sound of an armouring multitude the shouting and the braying of the
trumpets

These cold thinlipped calculators arguing that War doesnt pay
those lankhaired cosmopolitans preaching their International as if
the only business of mankind were wages War still was the stern school
where men learnt virtue duty forgetfulness of self faithfulness unto
death

This particular war of course must be stopped if it were not already
too late It would be a war for markets for spheres of commercial
influence a sordid war that would degrade the people War the supreme
test of a nations worth must be reserved for great ideals Besides
she wanted to down Carleton

One of the women on her list and the one to whom Mrs Denton appeared to
attach chief importance a Madame de Barante disappointed Joan She
seemed to have so few opinions of her own She had buried her young
husband during the FrancoPrussian war He had been a soldier And she
had remained unmarried She was still beautiful

I do not think we women have the right to discuss war she confided to
Joan in her gentle highbred voice I suppose you think that out of
date I should have thought so myself forty years ago We talk of
giving our sons and lovers as if they were ours to give It makes me
a little angry when I hear pampered women speak like that It is the men
who have to suffer and die It is for them to decide

But perhaps I can arrange a meeting for you with a friend she added
who will be better able to help you if he is in Paris I will let you
know

She told Joan what she remembered herself of 1870 She had turned her
country house into a hospital and had seen a good deal of the fighting

It would not do to tell the truth or we should have our children
growing up to hate war she concluded

She was as good as her word and sent Joan round a message the next
morning to come and see her in the afternoon Joan was introduced to a
Monsieur de Chaumont He was a soldierlylooking gentleman with a grey
moustache and a deep scar across his face

Hanged if I can see how we are going to get out of it he answered Joan
cheerfully The moment there is any threat of war it becomes a point
of honour with every nation to do nothing to avoid it I remember my old
duelling days The quarrel may have been about the silliest trifle
imaginable A single word would have explained the whole thing away But
to utter it would have stamped one as a coward This Egyptian Tralala
It isnt worth the bones of a single grenadier as our friends across the
Rhine would say But I expect before its settled there will be mens
bones sufficient bleaching on the desert to build another Pyramid Its
so easily started thats the devil of it A mischievous boy can throw a
lighted match into a powder magazine and then it becomes every patriots
business to see that it isnt put out I hate war It accomplishes
nothing and leaves everything in a greater muddle than it was before
But if the idea ever catches fire I shall have to do all I can to fan
the conflagration Unless I am prepared to be branded as a poltroon
Every professional soldier is supposed to welcome war Most of us do
its our opportunity Theres some excuse for us But these
menCarleton and their lot I regard them as nothing better than the
Menades of the Commune They care nothing if the whole of Europe blazes
They cannot personally get harmed whatever happens Its fun to them

But the people who can get harmed argued Joan The men who will be
dragged away from their work from their business used as cannon
fodder

He shrugged his shoulders Oh they are always eager enough for it at
first he answered There is the excitement The curiosity You must
remember that life is a monotonous affair to the great mass of the
people Theres the natural craving to escape from it to court
adventure They are not so enthusiastic about it after they have tasted
it Modern warfare they soon find is about as dull a business as
science ever invented

There was only one hope that he could see and that was to switch the
peoples mind on to some other excitement His advices from London told
him that a parliamentary crisis was pending Could not Mrs Denton and
her party do something to hasten it He on his side would consult with
the Socialist leaders who might have something to suggest

He met Joan radiant a morning or two later The English Government had
resigned and preparations for a general election were already on foot

And God has been good to us also he explained

A wellknown artist had been found murdered in his bed and grave
suspicion attached to his beautiful young wife

She deserves the Croix de Guerre if it is proved that she did it he
thought She will have saved many thousands of livesfor the present

Folk had fixed up a party at his studio to meet her She had been there
once or twice but this was a final affair She had finished her
business in Paris and would be leaving the next morning To her
surprise she found Phillips there He had come over hurriedly to attend
a Socialist conference and Leblanc the editor of _Le Nouveau Monde_
had brought him along

I took Smedleys place at the last moment he whispered to her Ive
never been abroad before You dont mind do you

It didnt strike her as at all odd that a leader of a political party
should ask her if she minded his being in Paris to attend a political
conference He was wearing a light grey suit and a blue tie There was
nothing about him at that moment suggesting that he was a leader of any
sort He might have been just any man but for his eyes

No she whispered Of course not I dont like your tie It seemed
to depress him that

She felt elated at the thought that he would see her for the first time
amid surroundings where she would shine Folk came forward to meet her
with that charming air of protective deference that he had adopted
towards her He might have been some favoured minister of state kissing
the hand of a youthful Queen She glanced down the long studio ending
in its fine window overlooking the park Some of the most distinguished
men in Paris were there and the immediate stir of admiration that her
entrance had created was unmistakable Even the women turned pleased
glances at her as if willing to recognize in her their representative A
sense of power came to her that made her feel kind to all the world
There was no need for her to be clever to make any effort to attract
Her presence her sympathy her approval seemed to be all that was needed
of her She had the consciousness that by the mere exercise of her will
she could sway the thoughts and actions of these men that sovereignty
had been given to her It reflected itself in her slightly heightened
colour in the increased brilliance of her eyes in the confident case of
all her movements It added a compelling softness to her voice

She never quite remembered what the talk was about Men were brought up
and presented to her and hung about her words and sought to please her
She had spoken her own thoughts indifferent whether they expressed
agreement or not and the argument had invariably taken another plane It
seemed so important that she should be convinced Some had succeeded
and had been strengthened Others had failed and had departed
sorrowful conscious of the necessity of thinking it out again

Guests with other engagements were taking their leave A piquante little
woman outrageously but effectively dressedshe looked like a drawing by
Beardsleydrew her aside Ive always wished I were a man she said
It seemed to me that they had all the power From this afternoon I
shall be proud of belonging to the governing sex

She laughed and slipped away

Phillips was waiting for her in the vestibule She had forgotten him
but now she felt glad of his humble request to be allowed to see her
home It would have been such a big drop from her crowded hour of
triumph to the long lonely cab ride and the solitude of the hotel She
resolved to be gracious feeling a little sorry for her neglect of
himbut reflecting with satisfaction that he had probably been watching
her the whole time

Whats the matter with my tie he asked Wrong colour

She laughed Yes she answered It ought to be grey to match your
suit And so ought your socks

I didnt know it was going to be such a swell affair or I shouldnt
have come he said

She touched his hand lightly

I want you to get used to it she said Its part of your work Put
your brain into it and dont be afraid

Ill try he said

He was sitting on the front seat facing her Im glad I went he said
with sudden vehemence I loved watching you moving about among all
those people I never knew before how beautiful you are

Something in his eyes sent a slight thrill of fear through her It was
not an unpleasant sensationrather exhilarating She watched the
passing street till she felt that his eyes were no longer devouring her

Youre not offended he asked At my thinking you beautiful he
added in case she hadnt understood

She laughed Her confidence had returned to her It doesnt generally
offend a woman she answered

He seemed relieved Thats whats so wonderful about you he said
Ive met plenty of clever brilliant women but one could forget that
they were women Youre everything

He pleaded standing below her on the steps of the hotel that she would
dine with him But she shook her head She had her packing to do She
could have managed it but something prudent and absurd had suddenly got
hold of her and he went away with much the same look in his eyes that
comes to a dog when he finds that his master cannot be persuaded into an
excursion

She went up to her room There really was not much to do She could
quite well finish her packing in the morning She sat down at the desk
and set to work to arrange her papers It was a warm spring evening and
the window was open A crowd of noisy sparrows seemed to be delighted
about something From somewhere unseen a blackbird was singing She
read over her report for Mrs Denton The blackbird seemed never to have
heard of war He sang as if the whole world were a garden of languor and
love Joan looked at her watch The first gong would sound in a few
minutes She pictured the dreary silent diningroom with its few
scattered occupants and her heart sank at the prospect To her relief
came remembrance of a cheerful but entirely respectable restaurant near
to the Louvre to which she had been taken a few nights before She had
noticed quite a number of women dining there alone She closed her
dispatch case with a snap and gave a glance at herself in the great
mirror The blackbird was still singing

She walked up the Rue des Sts Peres enjoying the delicious air Half
way across the bridge she overtook a man strolling listlessly in front
of her There was something familiar about him He was wearing a grey
suit and had his hands in his pockets Suddenly the truth flashed upon
her She stopped If he strolled on she would be able to slip back
Instead of which he abruptly turned to look down at a passing steamer
and they were face to face

It made her mad the look of delight that came into his eyes She could
have boxed his ears Hadnt he anything else to do but hang about the
streets

He explained that he had been listening to the band in the gardens
returning by the Quai dOrsay

Do let me come with you he said I kept myself free this evening
hoping And Im feeling so lonesome

Poor fellow She had come to understand that feeling After all it
wasnt altogether his fault that they had met And she had been so cross
to him

He was reading every expression on her face

Its such a lovely evening he said Couldnt we go somewhere and
dine under a tree

It would be rather pleasant There was a little place at Meudon she
remembered The plane trees would just be in full leaf

A passing cab had drawn up close to them The chauffeur was lighting his
pipe

Even Mrs Grundy herself couldnt object to a journalist dining with a
politician

The stars came out before they had ended dinner She had made him talk
about himself It was marvellous what he had accomplished with his
opportunities Ten hours a day in the mines had earned for him his
living and the night had given him his leisure An attic lighted by a
tallow candle with a shelf of books that left him hardly enough for
bread had been his Alma Mater History was his chief study There was
hardly an authority Joan could think of with which he was not familiar
_Julius Caesar_ was his favourite play He seemed to know it by heart
At twentythree he had been elected a delegate and had entered
Parliament at twentyeight It had been a life of hardship of
privation of constant strain but she found herself unable to pity him
It was a tale of strength of struggle of victory that he told her

Strength The shaded lamplight fell upon his fearless kindly face with
its flashing eyes and its humorous mouth He ought to have been drinking
out of a horn not a wine glass that his wellshaped hand could have
crushed by a careless pressure In a winged helmet and a coat of mail he
would have looked so much more fitly dressed than in that soft felt hat
and ridiculous blue tie

She led him to talk on about the future She loved to hear his clear
confident voice with its touch of boyish boastfulness What was there to
stop him Why should he not climb from power to power till he had
reached the end

And as he talked and dreamed there grew up in her heart a fierce anger
What would her own future be She would marry probably some man of her
own class settle down to the average womans life be allowed like a
spoilt child to still take an interest in public affairs hold
drawingrooms attended by cranks and political nonentities be
President perhaps of the local Womans Liberal League The
alternative to spend her days glued to a desk penning exhortations to
the people that Carleton and his like might or might not allow them to
read while youth and beauty slipped away from her leaving her one of
the ten thousand other lonely faded women forcing themselves unwelcome
into mens jobs There came to her a sense of having been robbed of what
was hers by primitive eternal law Greyson had been right She did love
powerpower to serve and shape the world She would have earned it and
used it well She could have helped him inspired him They would have
worked together he the force and she the guidance She would have
supplied the things he lacked It was to her he came for counsel as it
was But for her he would never have taken the first step What right
had this poor brainless lump of painted flesh to share his wounds his
triumphs What help could she give him when the time should come that he
should need it

Suddenly he broke off What a fool Im making of myself he said I
always was a dreamer

She forced a laugh Why shouldnt it come true she asked

They had the little garden to themselves The million lights of Paris
shone below them

Because you wont be there he answered and without you I cant do
it You think Im always like I am tonight bragging confident So I
am when you are with me You give me back my strength The plans and
hopes and dreams that were slipping from me come crowding round me
laughing and holding out their hands They are like the children They
need two to care for them I want to talk about them to someone who
understands them and loves them as I do I want to feel they are dear
to someone else as well as to myself that I must work for them for her
sake as well as for my own I want someone to help me to bring them
up

There were tears in his eyes He brushed them angrily away Oh I know
I ought to be ashamed of myself he said It wasnt her fault She
wasnt to know that a hotblooded young chap of twenty hasnt all his
wits about him any more than I was If I had never met you it wouldnt
have mattered Id have done my bit of good and have stopped there
content With you beside mehe looked away from her to where the
silent city peeped through its veil of nightI might have left the
world better than I found it

The blood had mounted to her face She drew back into the shadow beyond
the tiny sphere of light made by the little lamp

Men have accomplished great things without a womans help she said

Some men he answered Artists and poets They have the woman within
them Men like myselfthe mere fighter we are incomplete in ourselves
Male and female created He them We are lost without our mate

He was thinking only of himself Had he no pity for her So was she
also useless without her mate Neither was she of those here and
there who can stand alone Her task was that of the eternal woman to
make a home to cleanse the world of sin and sorrow make it a kinder
dwellingplace for the children that should come This man was her true
helpmeet He would have been her weapon her dear servant and she could
have rewarded him as none other ever could The lamplight fell upon his
ruddy face his strong white hands resting on the flimsy table He
belonged to an older order than her own That suggestion about him of
something primitive of something not yet altogether tamed She felt
again that slight thrill of fear that so strangely excited her A mist
seemed to be obscuring all things He seemed to be coming towards her
Only by keeping her eyes fixed on his moveless hands still resting on
the table could she convince herself that his arms were not closing
about her that she was not being drawn nearer and nearer to him
powerless to resist

Suddenly out of the mist she heard voices The waiter was standing
beside him with the bill She reached out her hand and took it The
usual few mistakes had occurred She explained them good temperedly
and the waiter with profuse apologies went back to have it corrected

He turned to her as the man went Try and forgive me he said in a low
voice It all came tumbling out before I thought what I was saying

The blood was flowing back into her veins Oh it wasnt your fault
she answered We must make the best we can of it

He bent forward so that he could see into her eyes

Tell me he said There was a note of fierce exultation in his voice
Ill promise never to speak of it again If I had been a free man
could I have won you

She had risen while he was speaking She moved to him and laid her hands
upon his shoulders

Will you serve me and fight for me against all my enemies she asked

So long as I live he answered

She glanced round There was no sign of the returning waiter She bent
over him and kissed him

Dont come with me she said Theres a cab stand in the Avenue I
shall walk to Sevres and take the train

She did not look back




CHAPTER XII


She reached home in the evening The Phillipss old rooms had been twice
let since Christmas but were now again empty The McKean with his
silent ways and his everlasting pipe had gone to America to superintend
the production of one of his plays The house gave her the feeling of
being haunted She had her dinner brought up to her and prepared for a
long evenings work but found herself unable to thinkexcept on the one
subject that she wanted to put off thinking about To her relief the
last post brought her a letter from Arthur He had been called to Lisbon
to look after a contract and would be away for a fortnight Her father
was not as well as he had been

It seemed to just fit in She would run down and spend a few quiet days
at Liverpool In her old familiar room where the moon peeped in over the
tops of the tall pines she would be able to reason things out Perhaps
her father would be able to help her She had lost her childish
conception of him as of someone prim and proper with cut and dried
formulas for all occasions That glimpse he had shown her of himself had
established a fellowship between them He too had wrestled with lifes
riddles not sure of his own answers She found him suffering from his
old heart trouble but more cheerful than she had known him for years
Arthur seemed to be doing wonders with the men They were coming to
trust him

The difficulty I have always been up against explained her father
has been their suspicion Whats the cunning old rascal up to now
Whats his little game That is always what I have felt they were
thinking to themselves whenever I have wanted to do anything for them It
isnt anything he says to them It seems to be just he himself

He sketched out their plans to her It seemed to be all going in at one
ear and out at the other What was the matter with her Perhaps she was
tired without knowing it She would get him to tell her all about it to
morrow Also tomorrow she would tell him about Phillips and ask his
advice It was really quite late If he talked any more now it would
give her a headache She felt it coming on

She made her goodnight extra affectionate hoping to disguise her
impatience She wanted to get up to her own room

But even that did not help her It seemed in some mysterious way to be
no longer her room but the room of someone she had known and half
forgotten who would never come back It gave her the same feeling she
had experienced on returning to the house in London that the place was
haunted The high cheval glass from her mothers dressingroom had been
brought there for her use The picture of an absurdly small childthe
child to whom this room had once belongedstanding before it naked rose
before her eyes She had wanted to see herself She had thought that
only her clothes stood in the way If we could but see ourselves as in
some magic mirror All the garments usage and education has dressed us
up in laid aside What was she underneath her artificial niceties her
prim moralities her laboriously acquired restraints her unconscious
pretences and hypocrisies She changed her clothes for a loose robe and
putting out the light drew back the curtains The moon peeped in over
the top of the tall pines but it only stared at her indifferent It
seemed to be looking for somebody else

Suddenly and intensely to her own surprise she fell into a passionate
fit of weeping There was no reason for it and it was altogether so
unlike her But for quite a while she was unable to control it
Gradually and of their own accord her sobs lessened and she was able
to wipe her eyes and take stock of herself in the long glass She
wondered for the moment whether it was really her own reflection that she
saw there or that of some ghostly image of her mother She had so often
seen the same look in her mothers eyes Evidently the likeness between
them was more extensive than she had imagined For the first time she
became conscious of an emotional hysterical side to her nature of which
she had been unaware Perhaps it was just as well that she had
discovered it She would have to keep a stricter watch upon herself
This question of her future relationship with Phillips it would have to
be thought out coldly dispassionately Nothing unexpected must be
allowed to enter into it

It was some time before she fell asleep The high glass faced her as she
lay in bed She could not get away from the idea that it was her
mothers face that every now and then she saw reflected there

She woke late the next morning Her father had already left for the
works She was rather glad to have no need of talking She would take a
long walk into the country and face the thing squarely with the help of
the cheerful sun and the free west wind that was blowing from the sea
She took the train up north and struck across the hills Her spirits
rose as she walked

It was only the intellectual part of him she wantedthe spirit not the
man She would be taking nothing away from the woman nothing that had
ever belonged to her All the rest of him his home life the benefits
that would come to her from his improved means from his social position
all that the woman had ever known or cared for in him would still be
hers He would still remain to her the kind husband and father What
more was the woman capable of understanding What more had she any right
to demand

It was not of herself she was thinking It was for his works sake that
she wanted to be near to him always that she might counsel him
encourage him For this she was prepared to sacrifice herself give up
her womans claim on life They would be friends comradesnothing
more That little lurking curiosity of hers concerning what it would be
like to feel his strong arms round her pressing her closer and closer to
him it was only a foolish fancy She could easily laugh that out of
herself Only bad women had need to be afraid of themselves She would
keep guard for both of them Their purity of motive their high purpose
would save them from the danger of anything vulgar or ridiculous

Of course they would have to be careful There must be no breath of
gossip no food for evil tongues About that she was determined even
more for his sake than her own It would be fatal to his career She
was quite in agreement with the popular demand supposed to be peculiarly
English that a public mans life should be above reproach Of what use
these prophets without selfcontrol these social reformers who could not
shake the ape out of themselves Only the brave could give courage to
others Only through the pure could Gods light shine upon men

It was vexing his having moved round the corner into North Street Why
couldnt the silly woman have been content where she was Living under
one roof they could have seen one another as often as was needful
without attracting attention Now she supposed she would have to be
more than ever the bosom friend of Mrs Phillipsspend hours amid that
hideous furniture surrounded by those bilious wallpapers Of course he
could not come to her She hoped he would appreciate the sacrifice she
would be making for him Fortunately Mrs Phillips would give no
trouble She would not even understand

What about Hilda No hope of hiding their secret from those sharp eyes
But Hilda would approve They could trust Hilda The child might prove
helpful

It cast a passing shadow upon her spirits this necessary descent into
details It brought with it the suggestion of intrigue of deceit
robbing the thing to a certain extent of its fineness Still what was
to be done If women were coming into public life these sort of
relationships with men would have to be faced and worked out Sex must
no longer be allowed to interfere with the working together of men and
women for common ends It was that had kept the world back They would
be the pioneers of the new order Casting aside their earthly passions
humbly with pure hearts they would kneel before Gods altar He should
bless their union

A lark was singing She stood listening Higher and higher he rose
pouring out his song of worship till the tiny fragile body disappeared
as if fallen from him leaving his sweet soul still singing The happy
tears came to her eyes and she passed on She did not hear that little
last faint sob with which he sank exhausted back to earth beside a hidden
nest among the furrows

She had forgotten the time It was already late afternoon Her long
walk and the keen air had made her hungry She had a couple of eggs with
her tea at a village inn and was fortunate enough to catch a train that
brought her back in time for dinner A little ashamed of her
unresponsiveness the night before she laid herself out to be sympathetic
to her fathers talk She insisted on hearing again all that he and
Arthur were doing opposing him here and there with criticism just
sufficient to stimulate him careful in the end to let him convince her

These small hypocrisies were new to her She hoped she was not damaging
her character But it was good watching him slyly from under drawndown
lids to see the flash of triumph that would come into his tired eyes in
answer to her halfprotesting Yes I see your point I hadnt thought
of that her half reluctant admission that perhaps he was right
there that perhaps she was wrong It was delightful to see him young
again eager boyishly pleased with himself It seemed there was a joy
she had not dreamed of in yielding victory as well as in gaining it A
new tenderness was growing up in her How considerate how patient how
selfforgetful he had always been She wanted to mother him To take
him in her arms and croon over him hushing away remembrance of the old
sad days

Folks words came back to her And poor Jack Allway Tell him I thank
him for all those years of love and gentleness She gave him the
message

Folk had been right He was not offended Dear old chap he said
That was kind of him He was always generous

He was silent for a while with a quiet look on his face

Give him our love he said Tell him we came together at the end

It was on her tongue to ask him as so often she had meant to do of late
what had been the cause of her mothers illnessif illness it was what
it was that had happened to change both their lives But always
something had stopped hersomething ever present ever watchful that
seemed to shape itself out of the air bending towards her with its
finger on its lips

She stayed over the weekend and on the Saturday at her suggestion
they took a long excursion into the country It was the first time she
had ever asked him to take her out He came down to breakfast in a new
suit and was quite excited In the car his hand had sought hers shyly
and feeling her responsive pressure he had continued to hold it and
they had sat for a long time in silence She decided not to tell him
about Phillips just yet He knew of him only from the Tory newspapers
and would form a wrong idea She would bring them together and leave
Phillips to make his own way He would like Phillips when he knew him
she felt sure He too was a peoples man The torch passed down to
him from his old Ironside ancestors it still glowed More than once she
had seen it leap to flame In congenial atmosphere it would burn clear
and steadfast It occurred to her what a delightful solution of her
problem if later on her father could be persuaded to leave Arthur in
charge of the works and come to live with her in London There was a
fine block of flats near Chelsea Church with long views up and down the
river How happy they could be there the drawingroom in the Adams
style with winecoloured curtains He was a father any young woman could
be proud to take about Unconsciously she gave his hand an impulsive
squeeze They lunched at an old inn upon the moors and the landlady
judging from his shy attentive ways had begun by addressing her as
Madame

You grow wonderfully like your mother he told her that evening at
dinner There used to be something missing But I dont feel that
now

She wrote to Phillips to meet her if possible at Euston There were
things she wanted to talk to him about There was the question whether
she should go on writing for Carleton or break with him at once Also
one or two points that were worrying her in connection with tariff
reform He was waiting for her on the platform It appeared he too
had much to say He wanted her advice concerning his next speech He
had not dined and suggested supper They could not walk about the
streets Likely enough it was only her imagination but it seemed to
her that people in the restaurant had recognized him and were whispering
to one another he was bound to be well known Likewise her own
appearance she felt was against them as regarded their desire to avoid
observation She would have to take to those mousey colours that did not
suit her and wear a veil She hated the idea of a veil It came from
the East and belonged there Besides what would be the use Unless he
wore one too Who is the veiled woman that Phillips goes about with
That is what they would ask It was going to be very awkward the whole
thing Viewed from the distance it had looked quite fine Dedicating
herself to the service of Humanity was how it had presented itself to
her in the garden at Meudon the twinkling labyrinth of Paris at her
feet its sordid byways hidden beneath its myriad lights She had not
bargained for the dedication involving the loss of her selfrespect

They did not talk as much as they had thought they would He was not
very helpful on the Carleton question There was so much to be said both
for and against It might be better to wait and see how circumstances
shaped themselves She thought his speech excellent It was difficult
to discover any argument against it

He seemed to be more interested in looking at her when he thought she was
not noticing That little faint vague fear came back to her and stayed
with her but brought no quickening of her pulse It was a fear of
something ugly She had the feeling they were both acting that
everything depended upon their not forgetting their parts In handing
things to one another they were both of them so careful that their hands
should not meet and touch

They walked together back to Westminster and wished each other a short
goodnight upon what once had been their common doorstep With her
latchkey in her hand she turned and watched his retreating figure and
suddenly a wave of longing seized her to run after him and call him
backto see his eyes light up and feel the pressure of his hands It
was only by clinging to the railings and counting till she was sure he
had entered his own house round the corner and closed the door behind
him that she restrained herself

It was a frightened face that looked at her out of the glass as she
stood before it taking off her hat

She decided that their future meetings should be at his own house Mrs
Phillipss only complaint was that she knocked at the door too seldom

I dont know what I should do without you I really dont confessed
the grateful lady If ever I become a Prime Ministers wife its you I
shall have to thank Youve got so much courage yourself you can put
the heart into him I never had any pluck to spare myself

She concluded by giving Joan a hug accompanied by a sloppy but heartfelt
kiss

She would stand behind Phillipss chair with her fat arms round his neck
nodding her approval and encouragement while Joan seated opposite
would strain every nerve to keep her brain fixed upon the argument never
daring to look at poor Phillipss wretched face with its pleading
apologetic eyes lest she should burst into hysterical laughter She
hoped she was being helpful and inspiring Mrs Phillips would assure
her afterwards that she had been wonderful As for herself there were
periods when she hadnt the faintest idea about what she was talking

Sometimes Mrs Phillips called away by domestic duty would leave them
returning full of excuses just as they had succeeded in forgetting her
It was evident she was under the impression that her presence was useful
to them making it easier for them to open up their minds to one another

Dont you be put off by his seeming a bit unresponsive Mrs Phillips
would explain Hes shy with women What Im trying to do is to make
him feel you are one of the family

And dont you take any notice of me further explained the good woman
when I seem to be in opposition like I chip in now and then on
purpose just to keep the ball rolling It stirs him up a bit of
contradictoriness You have to live with a man before you understand
him

One morning Joan received a letter from Phillips marked immediate He
informed her that his brain was becoming addled He intended that
afternoon to give it a draught of fresh air He would be at the Robin
Hood gate in Richmond Park at three oclock Perhaps the gods would be
good to him He would wait there for half an hour to give them a chance
anyway

She slipped the letter unconsciously into the bosom of her dress and sat
looking out of the window It promised to be a glorious day and London
was stifling and gritty Surely no one but an unwholesomeminded prude
could jib at a walk across a park Mrs Phillips would be delighted to
hear that she had gone For the matter of that she would tell herwhen
next they met

Phillips must have seen her getting off the bus for he came forward at
once from the other side of the gate his face radiant with boyish
delight A young man and woman entering the park at the same time
looked at them and smiled sympathetically

Joan had no idea the park contained such pleasant byways But for an
occasional perambulator they might have been in the heart of the country
The fallow deer stole near to them with noiseless feet regarding them
out of their large gentle eyes with looks of comradeship They paused
and listened while a missal thrush from a branch close to them poured out
his song of hope and courage From quite a long way off they could still
hear his clear voice singing telling to the young and brave his gallant
message It seemed too beautiful a day for politics After all
politicsone has them always with one but the spring passes

He saw her on to a bus at Kingston and himself went back by train They
agreed they would not mention it to Mrs Phillips Not that she would
have minded The danger was that she would want to come too honestly
thinking thereby to complete their happiness It seemed to be tacitly
understood there would be other such excursions

The summer was propitious Phillips knew his London well and how to get
away from it There were winding lanes in Hertfordshire Surrey hills
and commons deep cool birdhaunted woods in Buckingham Each week
there was something to look forward to something to plan for and
manoeuvre The sense of adventure a spice of danger added zest She
still knocked frequently as before at the door of the
hideouslyfurnished little house in North Street but Mrs Phillips no
longer oppressed her as some old man of the sea she could never hope to
shake off from her shoulders The flabby foolish face robbed of its
terrors became merely pitiful She found herself able to be quite
gentle and patient with Mrs Phillips Even the sloppy kisses she came
to bear without a shudder down her spine

I know you are only doing it because you sympathize with his aims and
want him to win acknowledged the good lady But I cant help feeling
grateful to you I dont feel how useless I am while Ive got you to run
to

They still discussed their various plans for the amelioration and
improvement of humanity but there seemed less need for haste than they
had thought The world Joan discovered was not so sad a place as she
had judged it There were chubby rogueeyed children whistling lads
and smiling maidens kindly men with ruddy faces happy mothers crooning
over gurgling babies There was no call to be fretful and vehement They
would work together in patience and in confidence Gods sun was
everywhere It needed only that dark places should be opened up and it
would enter

Sometimes seated on a lichened log or on the short grass of some
sloping hillside looking down upon some quiet valley they would find
they had been holding hands while talking It was but as two happy
thoughtless children might have done They would look at one another
with frank clear eyes and smile

Once when their pathway led through a littered farmyard he had taken
her up in his arms and carried her and she had felt a glad pride in him
that he had borne her lightly as if she had been a child looking up at
her and laughing

An old bent man paused from his work and watched them Lean more over
him missie he advised her Thats the way Many a mile Ive carried
my lass like that in flood time and never felt her weight

Often on returning home not knowing why she would look into the glass
It seemed to her that the girlhood she had somehow missed was awakening
in her taking possession of her changing her The lips she had always
seen pressed close and firm were growing curved leaving a little
parting as though they were not quite so satisfied with one another The
level brows were becoming slightly raised It gave her a questioning
look that was new to her The eyes beneath were less confident They
seemed to be seeking something

One evening on her way home from a theatre she met Flossie Cant
stop now said Flossie who was hurrying But I want to see you most
particular Was going to look you up Will you be at home tomorrow
afternoon at teatime

There was a distinct challenge in Flossies eye as she asked the
question Joan felt herself flush and thought a moment

Yes she answered Will you be coming alone

Thats the idea answered Flossie a heart to heart talk between you
and me and nobody else Halfpast four Dont forget

Joan walked on slowly She had the worried feeling with which once or
twice when a schoolgirl she had crawled up the stairs to bed after the
head mistress had informed her that she would see her in her private room
at eleven oclock the next morning leaving her to guess what about It
occurred to her in Trafalgar Square that she had promised to take tea
with the Greysons the next afternoon to meet some big pot from America
She would have to get out of that She felt it wouldnt do to put off
Flossie

She went to bed wakeful It was marvellously like being at school again
What could Flossie want to see her about that was so important She
tried to pretend to herself that she didnt know After all perhaps it
wasnt that

But she knew that it was the instant Flossie put up her hands in order to
take off her hat Flossie always took off her hat when she meant to be
unpleasant It was her way of pulling up her sleeves They had their
tea first They seemed both agreed that that would be best And then
Flossie pushed back her chair and sat up

She had just the head mistress expression Joan wasnt quite sure she
oughtnt to stand But controlling the instinct leant back in her
chair and tried to look defiant without feeling it

How far are you going demanded Flossie

Joan was not in a comprehending mood

If youre going the whole hog thats something I can understand
continued Flossie If not youd better pull up

What do you mean by the whole hog requested Joan assuming dignity

Oh dont come the kid advised Flossie If you dont mind being
talked about yourself you might think of him If Carleton gets hold of
it hes done for

A little bird whispers to me that Robert Phillips was seen walking
across Richmond Park the other afternoon in company with Miss Joan
Allway formerly one of our contributors Is that going to end his
political career retorted Joan with fine sarcasm

Flossie fixed a relentless eye upon her Hell wait till the bird has
got a bit more than that to whisper to him she suggested

Therell be nothing more explained Joan So long as my friendship is
of any assistance to Robert Phillips in his work hes going to have it
What use are we going to be in politicswhats all the fuss about if
men and women mustnt work together for their common aims and help one
another

Why cant you help him in his own house instead of wandering all about
the country Flossie wanted to know

So I do Joan defended herself Im in and out there till Im sick of
the hideous place You havent seen the inside And his wife knows all
about it and is only too glad

Does she know about Richmond Parkand the other places asked Flossie

She wouldnt mind if she did explained Joan And you know what shes
like How can one think what ones saying with that silly goggleeyed
face in front of one always

Flossie since she had become engaged had acquired quite a matronly
train of thought She spoke kindly with a little grave shake of her
head My dear she said the wife is always in the way Youd feel
just the same whatever her face was like

Joan grew angry If you choose to suspect evil of course you can she
answered with hauteur But you might have known me better I admire
the man and sympathize with him All the things I dream of are the
things he is working for I can do more good by helping and inspiring
himshe wished she had not let slip that word inspire She knew that
Flossie would fasten upon itthan I can ever accomplish by myself And
I mean to do it She really did feel defiant now

I know dear agreed Flossie youve both of you made up your minds it
shall always remain a beautiful union of twin spirits Unfortunately
youve both got bodiesrather attractive bodies

Well keep it off that plane if you dont mind answered Joan with a
touch of severity

Im willing enough answered Flossie But what about Old Mother
Nature Shes going to be in this you know

Take off your glasses and look at it straight she went on without
giving Joan time to reply What is it in us that inspires men If
its only advice and sympathy hes after whats wrong with dear old Mrs
Denton Shes a good walker except now and then when shes got the
lumbago Why doesnt he get her to inspire him

It isnt only that explained Joan I give him courage I always did
have more of that than is any use to a woman He wants to be worthy of
my belief in him What is the harm if he does admire meif a smile from
me or a touch of the hand can urge him to fresh effort Suppose he does
love me

Flossie interrupted How about being quite frank she suggested
Suppose we do love one another How about putting it that way

And suppose we do agreed Joan her courage rising Why should we
shun one another as if we were both of us incapable of decency or self
control Why must love be always assumed to make us weak and
contemptible as if it were some subtle poison Why shouldnt it
strengthen and ennoble us

Why did the apple fall answered Flossie Why when it escapes from
its bonds doesnt it soar upward If it wasnt for the irritating law
of gravity we could skip about on the brink of precipices without
danger Things being what they are sensible people keep as far away
from the edge as possible

Im sorry she continued awfully sorry old girl Its a bit of
rotten bad luck for both of you You were just made for one another And
Fate knowing what was coming bustles round and gets hold of poor silly
Mrs Phillips so as to be able to say Yah

Unless it all comes right in the end she added musingly and the poor
old soul pegs out I wouldnt give much for her liver

Thats not bringing me up well suggested Joan putting those ideas
into my head

Oh well one cant help ones thoughts explained Flossie It would
be a blessing all round

They had risen Joan folded her hands Thank you for your scolding
maam she said Shall I write out a hundred lines of Greek Or do
you think it will be sufficient if I promise never to do it again

You mean it said Flossie Of course you will go on seeing
himvisiting them and all that But you wont go gadding about so
that people can talk

Only through the bars in future she promised With the gaoler
between us She put her arms round Flossie and bent her head so that
her face was hidden

Flossie still seemed troubled She held on to Joan

You are sure of yourself she asked Were only the female of the
species We get hungry and thirsty too You know that kiddy dont
you

Joan laughed without raising her face Yes maam I know that she
answered Ill be good

She sat in the dusk after Flossie had gone and the laboured breathing of
the tired city came to her through the open window She had rather
fancied that martyrs crown It had not looked so very heavy the thorns
not so very alarmingas seen through the window She would wear it
bravely It would rather become her

Facing the mirror of the days to come she tried it on It was going to
hurt There was no doubt of that She saw the fatuous approving face
of the eternal Mrs Phillips thrust ever between them against the
background of that hideous furniture of those bilious wall papersthe
loneliness that would ever walk with her sit down beside her in the
crowded restaurant steal up the staircase with her creep step by step
with her from room to roomthe ever unsatisfied yearning for a tender
word a kindly touch Yes it was going to hurt

Poor Robert It would be hard on him too She could not help feeling
consolation in the thought that he also would be wearing that invisible
crown

She must write to him The sooner it was done the better Half a dozen
contradictory moods passed over her during the composing of that letter
but to her they seemed but the unfolding of a single thought On one
page it might have been his mother writing to him an experienced
sagacious lady quite aware in spite of her affection for him of his
faults and weaknesses solicitous that he should avoid the dangers of an
embarrassing entanglement his happiness being the only consideration of
importance On others it might have been a queen laying her immutable
commands upon some loyal subject sworn to her service Part of it might
have been written by a laughing philosopher who had learnt the folly of
taking life too seriously knowing that all things pass that the tears
of today will be remembered with a smile And a part of it was the
unconsidered language of a loving woman And those were the pages that
he kissed

His letter in answer was much shorter Of course he would obey her
wishes He had been selfish thinking only of himself As for his
political career he did not see how that was going to suffer by his
being occasionally seen in company with one of the most brilliantly
intellectual women in London known to share his views And he didnt
care if it did But inasmuch as she valued it all things should be
sacrificed to it It was hers to do what she would with It was the
only thing he had to offer her

Their meetings became confined as before to the little house in North
Street But it really seemed as if the gods appeased by their
submission had decided to be kind Hilda was home for the holidays and
her piercing eyes took in the situation at a flash She appeared to have
returned with a newborn and exacting affection for her mother that
astonished almost as much as it delighted the poor lady Feeling sudden
desire for a walk or a bus ride or to be taken to an entertainment no
one was of any use to Hilda but her mother Daddy had his silly politics
to think and talk about He must worry them out alone or with the
assistance of Miss Allway That was what she was there for Mrs
Phillips torn between her sense of duty and fear of losing this new
happiness would yield to the childs coaxing Often they would be left
alone to discuss the nations needs uninterrupted Conscientiously they
would apply themselves to the task Always to find that sooner or
later they were looking at one another in silence

One day Phillips burst into a curious laugh They had been discussing
the problem of the smallholder Joan had put a question to him and with
a slight start he had asked her to repeat it But it seemed she had
forgotten it

I had to see our solicitor one morning he explained when I was
secretary to a miners union up north A point had arisen concerning the
legality of certain payments It was a matter of vast importance to us
but he didnt seem to be taking any interest and suddenly he jumped up
Im sorry Phillips he said but Ive got a big trouble of my own on
at homeI guess you know whatand I dont seem to care a damn about
yours Youd better see Delauny if youre in a hurry And I did

He turned and leant over his desk I guess theyll have to find another
leader if theyre in a hurry he added I dont seem able to think
about turnips and cows

Dont make me feel Ive interfered with your work only to spoil it
said Joan

I guess Im spoiling yours too he answered Im not worth it I
might have done something to win you and keep you Im not going to do
much without you

You mean my friendship is going to be of no use to you asked Joan

He raised his eyes and fixed them on her with a pleading doglike look

For Gods sake dont take even that away from me he said Unless you
want me to go to pieces altogether A crust does just keep one alive
One cant help thinking what a fine strong chap one might be if one
wasnt always hungry

She felt so sorry for him He looked such a boy with the angry tears in
his clear blue eyes and that little childish quivering of the kind
strong sulky mouth

She rose and took his head between her hands and turned his face towards
her She had meant to scold him but changed her mind and laid his head
against her breast and held it there

He clung to her as a troubled child might with his arms clasped round
her and his head against her breast And a mist rose up before her and
strange commanding voices seemed calling to her

He could not see her face She watched it herself with dim half
consciousness as it changed before her in the tawdry mirror above the
mantelpiece half longing that he might look up and see it half
terrified lest he should

With an effort that seemed to turn her into stone she regained command
over herself

I must go now she said in a harsh voice and he released her

Im afraid Im an awful nuisance to you he said I get these moods
at times Youre not angry with me

No she answered with a smile But it will hurt me if you fail
Remember that

She turned down the Embankment after leaving the house She always found
the river strong and restful So it was not only bad women that needed
to be afraid of themselveseven to the most highclass young woman with
letters after her name and altruistic interests even to her also the
longing for the lovers clasp Flossie had been right Mother Nature
was not to be flouted of her childrennot even of her new daughters to
them likewise the family trait

She would have run away if she could leaving him to guess at her real
reasonif he were smart enough But that would have meant excuses and
explanations all round She was writing a daily column of notes for
Greyson now in addition to the weekly letter from Clorinda and Mrs
Denton having compromised with her first dreams was delegating to Joan
more and more of her work She wrote to Mrs Phillips that she was
feeling unwell and would be unable to lunch with them on the Sunday as
had been arranged Mrs Phillips much disappointed suggested
Wednesday but it seemed on Wednesday she was no better And so it
drifted on for about a fortnight without her finding the courage to come
to any decision and then one morning turning the corner into Abingdon
Street she felt a slight pull at her sleeve and Hilda was beside her
The child had shown an uncanny intuition in not knocking at the door
Joan had been fearing that and would have sent down word that she was
out But it had to be faced

Are you never coming again asked the child

Of course answered Joan when Im better Im not very well just
now Its the weather I suppose

The child turned her head as they walked and looked at her Joan felt
herself smarting under that look but persisted

Im very much run down she said I may have to go away

You promised to help him said the child

I cant if Im ill retorted Joan Besides I am helping him There
are other ways of helping people than by wasting their time talking to
them

He wants you said the child Its your being there that helps him

Joan stopped and turned Did he send you she asked

No the child answered Mama had a headache this morning and I
slipped out Youre not keeping your promise

Palace Yard save for a statuesque policeman was empty

How do you know that my being with him helps him asked Joan

You know things when you love anybody explained the child You feel
them You will come again soon

Joan did not answer

Youre frightened the child continued in a passionate low voice You
think that people will talk about you and look down upon you You
oughtnt to think about yourself You ought to think only about him and
his work Nothing else matters

I am thinking about him and his work Joan answered Her hand sought
Hildas and held it There are things you dont understand Men and
women cant help each other in the way you think They may try to and
mean no harm in the beginning but the harm comes and then not only the
woman but the man also suffers and his work is spoilt and his life
ruined

The small hot hand clasped Joans convulsively

But he wont be able to do his work if you keep away and never come back
to him she persisted Oh I know it It all depends upon you He
wants you

And I want him if thats any consolation to you Joan answered with a
short laugh It wasnt much of a confession The child was cute enough
to have found that out for herself Only you see I cant have him And
theres an end of it

They had reached the Abbey Joan turned and they retraced their steps
slowly

I shall be going away soon for a little while she said The talk had
helped her to decision When I come back I will come and see you all
And you must all come and see me now and then I expect I shall have a
flat of my own My father may be coming to live with me Goodbye Do
all you can to help him

She stooped and kissed the child straining her to her almost fiercely
But the childs lips were cold She did not look back

Miss Greyson was sympathetic towards her desire for a longish holiday and
wonderfully helpful and Mrs Denton also approved and to Joans
surprise kissed her Mrs Denton was not given to kissing She wired to
her father and got his reply the same evening He would be at her rooms
on the day she had fixed with his travelling bag and at her Ladyships
orders With love and many thanks he had added She waited till the
day before starting to run round and say goodbye to the Phillipses She
felt it would be unwise to try and get out of doing that Both Phillips
and Hilda she was thankful were out and she and Mrs Phillips had tea
alone together The talk was difficult so far as Joan was concerned If
the woman had been possessed of ordinary intuition she might have
arrived at the truth Joan almost wished she would It would make her
own future task the easier But Mrs Phillips it was clear was going
to be no help to her

For her fathers sake she made pretence of eagerness but as the sea
widened between her and the harbour lights it seemed as if a part of
herself were being torn away from her

They travelled leisurely through Holland and the Rhine land and that
helped a little the new scenes and interests and in Switzerland they
discovered a delightful little village in an upland valley with just one
small hotel and decided to stay there for a while so as to give
themselves time to get their letters They took long walks and climbs
returning tired and hungry looking forward to their dinner and the
evening talk with the few other guests on the veranda The days passed
restfully in that hidden valley The great white mountains closed her
in They seemed so strong and clean

It was on the morning they were leaving that a telegram was put into her
hands Mrs Phillips was ill at lodgings in Folkestone She hoped that
Joan on her way back would come to see her

She showed the telegram to her father Do you mind Dad if we go
straight back she asked

No dear he answered if you wish it

I would like to go back she said




CHAPTER XIII


Mrs Phillips was sitting up in an easy chair near the heavilycurtained
windows when Joan arrived It was a pleasant little house in the old
part of the town and looked out upon the harbour She was startlingly
thin by comparison with what she had been but her face was still
painted Phillips would run down by the afternoon train whenever he
could get away She never knew when he was coming so she explained and
she could not bear the idea of his finding her old and ugly She had
fought against his wish that she should go into a nursing home and Joan
who in the course of her work upon the _Nursing Times_ had acquired some
knowledge of them as a whole was inclined to agree with her She was
quite comfortable where she was The landlady according to her account
was a dear She had sent the nurse out for a walk on getting Joans
wire so that they could have a cosy chat She didnt really want much
attendance It was her heart It got feeble now and then and she had
to keep very still that was all Joan told how her father had suffered
for years from much the same complaint So long as you were careful
there was no danger She must take things easily and not excite herself

Mrs Phillips acquiesced Its turning me into a lazybones she said
with a smile I can sit here by the hour just watching the bustle I
was always one for a bit of life

The landlady entered with Joans tea Joan took an instinctive dislike
to her She was a large flashy woman wearing a quantity of cheap
jewellery Her familiarity had about it something almost threatening
Joan waited till she heard the womans heavy tread descending the stairs
before she expressed her opinion

I think she only means to be cheerful explained Mrs Phillips Shes
quite a good sort when you know her The subject seemed in some way to
trouble her and Joan dropped it

They watched the loading of a steamer while Joan drank her tea

He will come this afternoon I fancy said Mrs Phillips I seem to
feel it He will be able to see you home

Joan started She had been thinking about Phillips wondering what she
should say to him when they met

What does he think she asked about your illness

Oh it worries him of course poor dear Mrs Phillips answered You
see Ive always been such a goahead as a rule But I think hes
getting more hopeful As I tell him Ill be all right by the autumn It
was that spell of hot weather that knocked me over

Joan was still looking out of the window She didnt quite know what to
say The womans altered appearance had shocked her Suddenly she felt
a touch upon her hand

Youll look after him if anything does happen wont you The womans
eyes were pleading with her They seemed to have grown larger You
know what I mean dear dont you she continued It will be such a
comfort to me to know that its all right

In answer the tears sprang to Joans eyes She knelt down and put her
arms about the woman

Dont be so silly she cried Theres nothing going to happen Youre
going to get fat and well again and live to see him Prime Minister

I am getting thin aint I she said I always wanted to be thin
They both laughed

But I shant see him that even if I do live she went on Hell
never be that without you And Id be so proud to think that he would
I shouldnt mind going then she added

Joan did not answer There seemed no words that would come

You will promise wont you she persisted in a whisper Its only
in casejust that I neednt worry myself

Joan looked up There was something in the eyes looking down upon her
that seemed to be compelling her

If youll promise to try and get better she answered

Mrs Phillips stooped and kissed her Of course dear she said
Perhaps I shall now that my mind is easier

Phillips came as Mrs Phillips had predicted He was surprised at
seeing Joan He had not thought she could get back so soon He brought
an evening paper with him It contained a paragraph to the effect that
Mrs Phillips wife of the Rt Hon Robert Phillips MP was
progressing favourably and hoped soon to be sufficiently recovered to
return to her London residence It was the first time she had had a
paragraph all to herself headed with her name She flushed with
pleasure and Joan noticed that after reading it again she folded the
paper up small and slipped it into her pocket The nurse came in from
her walk a little later and took Joan downstairs with her

She ought not to talk to more than one person at a time the nurse
explained with a shake of the head She was a quiet businesslike
woman She would not express a definite opinion

Its her mental state that is the trouble was all that she would say
She ought to be getting better But she doesnt

Youre not a Christian Scientist by any chance she asked Joan
suddenly

No answered Joan Surely youre not one

I dont know answered the woman I believe that would do her more
good than anything else If she would listen to it She seems to have
lost all willpower

The nurse left her and the landlady came in to lay the table She
understood that Joan would be dining with Mr Phillips There was no
train till the eightforty She kept looking at Joan as she moved about
the room Joan was afraid she would begin to talk but she must have
felt Joans antagonism for she remained silent Once their eyes met and
the woman leered at her

Phillips came down looking more cheerful He had detected improvement in
Mrs Phillips She was more hopeful in herself They talked in low
tones during the meal as people do whose thoughts are elsewhere It
happened quite suddenly Phillips explained They had come down a few
days after the rising of Parliament There had been a spell of hot
weather but nothing remarkable The first attack had occurred about
three weeks ago It was just after Hilda had gone back to school He
wasnt sure whether he ought to send for Hilda or not Her mother
didnt want him tonot just yet Of course if she got worse he would
have to What did Joan thinkdid she think there was any real danger

Joan could not say So much depended upon the general state of health
There was the case of her own father Of course she would always be
subject to attacks But this one would have warned her to be careful

Phillips thought that living out of town might be better for her in the
futuresomewhere in Surrey where he could easily get up and down He
could sleep himself at the club on nights when he had to be late

They talked without looking at one another They did not speak about
themselves

Mrs Phillips was in bed when Joan went up to say goodbye Youll come
again soon she asked and Joan promised Youve made me so happy
she whispered The nurse was in the room

They discussed politics in the train Phillips had found more support
for his crusade against Carleton than he had expected He was going to
open the attack at once thus forestalling Carletons opposition to his
land scheme

It isnt going to be the _Daily This_ and the _Daily That_ and the
_Weekly the Other_ all combined to down me Im going to tell the people
that its Carleton and only CarletonCarleton here Carleton there
Carleton everywhere against them Im going to drag him out into the
open and make him put up his own fists

Joan undertook to sound Greyson She was sure Greyson would support him
in his balanced gentlemanly way that could nevertheless be quite
deadly

They grew less and less afraid of looking at one another as they felt
that darkened room further and further behind them

They parted at Charing Cross Joan would write They agreed it would be
better to choose separate days for their visits to Folkestone

She ran against Madge in the morning and invited herself to tea Her
father had returned to Liverpool and her own rooms for some reason
depressed her Flossie was there with young Halliday They were both
off the next morning to his peoples place in Devonshire from where they
were going to get married and had come to say goodbye Flossie put Sam
in the passage and drewto the door

Have you seen her she asked How is she

Oh shes changed a good deal answered Joan But I think shell get
over it all right if shes careful

I shall hope for the best answered Flossie Poor old soul shes had
a good time Dont send me a present and then I neednt send you
onewhen your time comes Its a silly custom Besides Ive nowhere
to put it Shall be in a ship for the next six months Will let you
know when were back

She gave Joan a hug and a kiss and was gone Joan joined Madge in the
kitchen where she was toasting buns

I suppose shes satisfied herself that hes brainy she laughed

Oh brains arent everything answered Madge Some of the worst
rotters the world has ever been cursed with have been brainy enoughmen
and women We make too much fuss about brains just as once upon a time
we did about mere brute strength thinking that was all that was needed
to make a man great Brain is only muscle translated into civilization
Thats not going to save us

Youve been thinking Joan accused her Whats put all that into your
head

Madge laughed Mixing with so many brainy people perhaps she
suggested and wondering whats become of their souls

Be good sweet child And let who can be clever Joan quoted Would
that be your text

Madge finished buttering her buns Kant wasnt it she answered who
marvelled chiefly at two things the starry firmament above him and the
moral law within him And theyre one and the same if hed only thought
it out Its rather big to be good

They carried their tea into the sittingroom

Do you really think shell get over it asked Madge Or is it one of
those things one has to say

I think she could answered Joan if she would pull herself together
Its her lack of willpower thats the trouble

Madge did not reply immediately She was watching the rooks settling
down for the night in the elm trees just beyond the window There seemed
to be much need of coming and going of much cawing

I met her pretty often during those months that Helen Lavery was running
her round she said at length It always seemed to me to have a touch
of the heroic that absurd effort she was making to qualify herself so
that she might be of use to him I can see her doing something quite
big if she thought it would help him

The cawing of the rooks grew fainter One by one they folded their
wings

Neither spoke for a while Later on they talked about the coming
election If the Party got back Phillips would go to the Board of
Trade It would afford him a better platform for the introduction of his
land scheme

What do you gather is the general opinion Joan asked That he will
succeed

The general opinion seems to be that his star is in the ascendant
Madge answered with a smile that all things are working together for
his good Its rather a useful atmosphere to have about one that It
breeds friendship and support

Joan looked at her watch She had an article to finish Madge stood on
tiptoe and kissed her

Dont think me unsympathetic she said No one will rejoice more than
I shall if God sees fit to call you to good work But I cant help
letting fall my little tear of fellowship with the weeping

And mind your ps and qs she added Youre in a difficult position
And not all the eyes watching you are friendly

Joan bore the germ of worry in her breast as she crossed the Grays Inn
Garden It was a hard law that of the world knowing only winners and
losers Of course the woman was to be pitied No one could feel more
sorry for her than Joan herself But what had Madge exactly meant by
those words that she could see her doing something really big if she
thought it would help him There was no doubt about her affection for
him It was almost doglike And the child also There must be
something quite exceptional about him to have won the devotion of two
such opposite beings Especially Hilda It would be hard to imagine any
lengths to which Hildas blind idolatry would not lead her

She ran down twice to Folkestone during the following week Her visits
made her mind easier Mrs Phillips seemed so placid so contented
There was no suggestion of suffering either mental or physical

She dined with the Greysons the Sunday after and mooted the question of
the coming fight with Carleton Greyson thought Phillips would find
plenty of journalistic backing The concentration of the Press into the
hands of a few conscienceless schemers was threatening to reduce the
journalist to a mere hireling and the betterclass men were becoming
seriously alarmed He found in his desk the report of a speech made by a
wellknown leader writer at a recent dinner of the Press Club The man
had risen to respond to the toast of his own health and had taken the
opportunity to unpack his heart

I am paid a thousand a year so Greyson read to them for keeping my
own opinions out of my paper Some of you perhaps earn more and
others less but youre getting it for writing what youre told If I
were to be so foolish as to express my honest opinion Id be on the
street the next morning looking for another job

The business of the journalist the man had continued is to destroy
the truth to lie to pervert to vilify to fawn at the feet of Mammon
to sell his soul for his daily bread We are the tools and vassals of
rich men behind the scenes We are the jumpingjacks They pull the
strings and we dance Our talents our possibilities our lives are the
property of other men

We tried to pretend it was only one of Jacks little jokes explained
Greyson as he folded up the cutting but it wouldnt work It was too
near the truth

I dont see what you are going to do commented Mary So long as men
are not afraid to sell their souls there will always be a Devils market
for them

Greyson did not so much mind there being a Devils market provided he
could be assured of an honest market alongside so that a man could take
his choice What he feared was the Devils steady encroachment that
could only end by the closing of the independent market altogether His
remedy was the introduction of the American trust law forbidding any one
man being interested in more than a limited number of journals

But whats the difference demanded Joan between a man owning one
paper with a circulation of say six millions or owning six with a
circulation of a million apiece By concentrating all his energies on
one a man with Carletons organizing genius might easily establish a
single journal that would cover the whole field

Just all the difference answered Greyson between Pooh Bah as
Chancellor of the Exchequer or Lord High Admiral or Chief Executioner
whichever he preferred to be and Pooh Bah as all the Officers of State
rolled into one Pooh Bah may be a very able statesman entitled to
exert his legitimate influence But after all his opinion is only the
opinion of one old gentleman with possible prejudices and preconceived
convictions The Mikadoor the people according to localitywould
like to hear the views of others of his ministers He finds that the
Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice and the Groom of the
Bedchamber and the AttorneyGeneralthe whole entire Cabinet in short
are unanimously of the same opinion as Pooh Bah He doesnt know its
only Pooh Bah speaking from different corners of the stage The
consensus of opinion convinces him One statesman however eminent
might err in judgment But half a score of statesmen all of one mind
One must accept their verdict

Mary smiled But why shouldnt the good newspaper proprietor hurry up
and become a multiproprietor she suggested Why dont you persuade
Lord Sutcliffe to buy up three or four papers before theyre all gone

Because I dont want the Devil to get hold of him answered Greyson

Youve got to face this unalterable law he continued That power
derived from worldly sources can only be employed for worldly purposes
The power conferred by popularity by wealth by that ability to make use
of other men that we term organizationsooner or later the man who
wields that power becomes the Devils servant So long as Kingship was
merely a force struggling against anarchy it was a holy weapon As it
grew in power so it degenerated into an instrument of tyranny The
Church so long as it remained a scattered body of meek lowly men did
the Lords work Enthroned at Rome it thundered its edicts against
human thought The Press is in danger of following precisely the same
history When it wrote in fear of the pillory and of the jail it fought
for Liberty Now it has become the Fourth Estate it fawnsas Jack
Swinton said of itat the feet of Mammon My Proprietor good fellow
allows me to cultivate my plot amid the wilderness for other purposes
than those of quick returns If he were to become a competitor with the
Carletons and the Bloomfields he would have to look upon it as a
business proposition The Devil would take him up on to the high
mountain and point out to him the kingdom of huge circulations and vast
profits whispering to him All this will I give thee if thou wilt fall
down and worship me I dont want the dear good fellow to be tempted

Is it impossible then to combine duty and success questioned Joan

The combination sometimes happens by chance admitted Greyson But
its dangerous to seek it It is so easy to persuade ourselves that its
our duty to succeed

But we must succeed to be of use urged Mary Must Gods servants
always remain powerless

Powerless to rule Powerful only to serve he answered Powerful as
Christ was powerful not as Caesar was powerfulpowerful as those who
have suffered and have failed leaders of forlorn hopespowerful as
those who have struggled on despised and vilified not as those of whom
all men speak wellpowerful as those who have fought lone battles and
have died not knowing their own victory It is those that serve not
those that rule shall conquer

Joan had never known him quite so serious Generally there was a touch
of irony in his talk a suggestion of aloofness that had often irritated
her

I wish you would always be yourself as you are now she said and
never pose

Do I pose he asked raising his eyebrows

That shows how far it has gone she told him that you dont even know
it You pretend to be a philosopher But youre really a man

He laughed It isnt always a pose he explained Its some mens
way of saying Thy will be done

Ask Phillips to come and see me he said I can be of more help if I
know exactly his views

He walked with her to the bus They passed a corner house that he had
more than once pointed out to her It had belonged years ago to a well
known artist who had worked out a wonderful scheme of decoration in the
drawingroom A board was up announcing that the house was for sale A
gas lamp exactly opposite threw a flood of light upon the huge white
lettering

Joan stopped Why its the house you are always talking about she
said Are you thinking of taking it

I did go over it he answered But it would be rather absurd for just
Mary and me

She looked up Phillips at the House and gave him Greysons message He
had just returned from Folkestone and was worried

She was so much better last week he explained But it never lasts

Poor old girl he added I believe shed have been happier if Id
always remained plain Bob Phillips

Joan had promised to go down on the Friday but finding on the Thursday
morning that it would be difficult decided to run down that afternoon
instead She thought at first of sending a wire But in Mrs Phillipss
state of health telegrams were perhaps to be avoided It could make no
difference The front door of the little house was standing half open
She called down the kitchen stairs to the landlady but received no
answer The woman had probably run out on some short errand She went
up the stairs softly The bedroom door she knew would be open Mrs
Phillips had a feeling against being shut off as she called it She
meant to tap lightly and walk straight in as usual But what she saw
through the opening caused her to pause Mrs Phillips was sitting up in
bed with her box of cosmetics in front of her She was sensitive of
anyone seeing her makeup and Joan knowing this drew back a step But
for some reason she couldnt help watching Mrs Phillips dipped a
brush into one of the compartments and then remained with it in her hand
as if hesitating Suddenly she stuck out her tongue and passed the brush
over it At least so it seemed to Joan It was only a side view of
Mrs Phillipss face that she was obtaining and she may have been
mistaken It might have been the lips The woman gave a little gasp and
sat still for a moment Then putting away the brush she closed the box
and slipped it under the pillow

Joan felt her knees trembling A cold creeping fear was taking
possession of her Why she could not understand She must have been
mistaken People dont makeup their tongues It must have been the
lips And even if notif the woman had licked the brush It was a
silly trick people do Perhaps she liked the taste She pulled herself
together and tapped at the door

Mrs Phillips gave a little start at seeing her but was glad that she
had come Phillips had not been down for two days and she had been
feeling lonesome She persisted in talking more than Joan felt was good
for her She was feeling so much better she explained Joan was
relieved when the nurse came back from her walk and insisted on her lying
down She dropped to sleep while Joan and the nurse were having their
tea

Joan went back by the early train She met some people at the station
that she knew and travelled up with them That picture of Mrs
Phillipss tongue just showing beyond the line of Mrs Phillipss cheek
remained at the back of her mind but it was not until she was alone in
her own rooms that she dared let her thoughts return to it

The suggestion that was forcing itself into her brain was
monstrousunthinkable That never possessed of any surplus vitality
and suffering from the added lassitude of illness the woman should have
become indifferentwilling to let a life that to her was full of fears
and difficulties slip peacefully away from her that was possible But
that she should exercise thought and ingenuitythat she should have
reasoned the thing out and deliberately laid her plans calculating at
every point on their success it was inconceivable

Besides what could have put the idea into her head It was laughable
the presumption that she was a finished actress capable of deceiving
everyone about her If she had had an inkling of the truth Joan with
every nerve on the alert almost hoping for it would have detected it
She had talked with her alone the day before she had left England and
the woman had been full of hopes and projects for the future

That picture of Mrs Phillips propped up against the pillows with her
makeup box upon her knees was still before her when she went to bed All
night long it haunted her whether thinking or dreaming of it she could
not tell

Suddenly she sat up with a stifled cry It seemed as if a flash of
light had been turned upon her almost blinding her

Hilda Why had she never thought of it The whole thing was so obvious
You ought not to think about yourself You ought to think only of him
and of his work Nothing else matters If she could say that to Joan
what might she not have said to her mother who so clearly she divined
to be the incubusthe drag upon her fathers career She could hear the
childs dry passionate tonescould see Mrs Phillipss flabby cheeks
grow whitethe frightened staring eyes Where her father was concerned
the child had neither conscience nor compassion She had waited her
time It was a few days after Hildas return to school that Mrs
Phillips had been first taken ill

She flung herself from the bed and drew the blind A chill grey light
penetrated the room It was a little before five She would go round to
Phillips wake him up He must be told

With her hat in her hands she paused No That would not do Phillips
must never know They must keep the secret to themselves She would go
down and see the woman reason with her insist She went into the other
room It was lighter there The ABC was standing in its usual
place upon her desk There was a train to Folkestone at sixfifteen She
had plenty of time It would be wise to have a cup of tea and something
to eat There would be no sense in arriving there with a headache She
would want her brain clear

It was halfpast five when she sat down with her tea in front of her It
was only ten minutes walk to Charing Crosssay a quarter of an hour
She might pick up a cab She grew calmer as she ate and drank Her
reason seemed to be returning to her There was no such violent hurry
Hadnt she better think things over in the clear daylight The woman
had been ill now for nearly six weeks a few hoursa day or twocould
make no difference It might alarm the poor creature her unexpected
appearance at such an unusual hourcause a relapse Suppose she had
been mistaken Hadnt she better make a few inquiries firstfeel her
way One did harm more often than good acting on impulse After all
had she the right to interfere Oughtnt the thing to be thought over as
a whole Mightnt there be arguments worth considering against her
interference Her brain was too much in a whirl Hadnt she better wait
till she could collect and arrange her thoughts

The silver clock upon her desk struck six It had been a gift from her
father when she was at Girton It never obtruded Its voice was a faint
musical chime that she need not hear unless she cared to listen She
turned and looked at it It seemed to be a little face looking back at
her out of its two round blinkless eyes For the first time during all
the years that it had watched beside her she heard its quick impatient
tick

She sat motionless staring at it The problem in some way had
simplified itself into a contest between herself demanding time to
think and the little insistent clock shouting to her to act upon blind
impulse If she could remain motionless for another five minutes she
would have won

The ticking of the little clock was filling the room The thing seemed
to have become aliveto be threatening to burst its heart But the
thin delicate indicator moved on

Suddenly its ticking ceased It had become again a piece of lifeless
mechanism The hands pointed to six minutes past Joan took off her hat
and laid it aside

She must think the whole thing over quietly




CHAPTER XIV


She could help him Without her he would fail The woman herself saw
that and wished it Why should she hesitate It was not as if she had
only herself to consider The fatethe happiness of millions was at
stake He looked to her for aidfor guidance It must have been
intended All roads had led to it Her going to the house She
remembered now it was the first door at which she had knocked Her
footsteps had surely been directed Her meeting with Mrs Phillips in
Madges rooms and that invitation to dinner coinciding with that crisis
in his life It was she who had persuaded him to accept But for her he
would have doubted wavered let his opportunities slip by He had
confessed it to her

And she had promised him He needed her The words she had spoken to
Madge not dreaming then of their swift application They came back to
her God has called me He girded His sword upon me What right had
she to leave it rusting in its scabbard turning aside from the pathway
pointed out to her because of one weak useless life crouching in her
way It was not as if she were being asked to do evil herself that good
might come The decision had been taken out of her hands All she had
to do was to remain quiescent not interfering awaiting her orders Her
business was with her own part not with anothers To be willing to
sacrifice oneself that was at the root of all service Sometimes it was
ones own duty sometimes that of another Must one never go forward
because another steps out of ones way voluntarily Besides she might
have been mistaken That picture ever before her of the woman pausing
with the brush above her tonguethat little stilled gasp It may have
been but a phantasm born of her own fevered imagination She clung to
that desperately

It was the task that had been entrusted to her How could he hope to
succeed without her With her he would be all powerfulaccomplish the
end for which he had been sent into the world Society counts for so
much in England What public man had ever won through without its
assistance As Greyson had said it is the dinnertable that rules She
could win it over to his side That mission to Paris that she had
undertaken for Mrs Denton that had brought her into contact with
diplomatists politicians the leaders and the rulers the bearers of
names known and honoured in history They had accepted her as one of
themselves She had influenced them swayed them That afternoon at
Folks studio where all eyes had followed her where famous men and
women had waited to attract her notice had hung upon her words Even at
school at college she had always commanded willing homage As Greyson
had once told her it was herselfher personality that was her greatest
asset Was it to be utterly wasted There were hundreds of impersonal
sexless women equipped for nothing else with pens as keen if not keener
than hers That was not the talent with which she had been entrustedfor
which she would have to account It was her beauty her power to charm
to draw after herto compel by the mere exercise of her will Hitherto
Beauty had been content to barter itself for mere coin of the realmfor
ease and luxury and pleasure She only asked to be allowed to spend it
in service As his wife she could use it to fine ends By herself she
was helpless One must take the world as one finds it It gives the
unmated woman no opportunity to employ the special gifts with which God
has endowed herexcept for evil As the wife of a rising statesman she
could be a force for progress She could become another Madame Roland
gather round her all that was best of English social life give back to
it its lost position in the vanguard of thought

She could strengthen him give him courage Without her he would always
remain the mere fighter doubtful of himself The confidence the
inspiration necessary for leadership she alone could bring to him Each
by themselves was incomplete Together they would be the whole They
would build the city of their dreams

She seemed to have become a wandering spirit rather than a living being
She had no sense of time or place Once she had started hearing herself
laugh She was seated at a table and was talking And then she had
passed back into forgetfulness Now from somewhere she was gazing
downward Roofs domes and towers lay stretched before her emerging
from a sea of shadows She held out her arms towards them and the tears
came to her eyes The poor tired people were calling to her to join with
him to help them Should she fail themturn deaf ears to the myriad
because of pity for one useless feeble life

She had been fashioned to be his helpmate as surely as if she had been
made of the same bone Nature was at one with God Spirit and body both
yearned for him It was not positionpower for herself that she craved
The marriage marketif that had been her desire it had always been open
to her She had the gold that buys these things Wealth ambition they
had been offered to herspread out temptingly before her eyes They
were always within her means if ever she chose to purchase them It was
this man alone to whom she had ever felt drawnthis man of the people
with that suggestion about him of something primitive untamed causing
her always in his presence that faint compelling thrill of fear who
stirred her blood as none of the polished men of her own class had ever
done His kind strong ugly face it moved beside her its fearless
tender eyes now pleading now commanding

He needed her She heard his passionate low voice as she had heard it
in the little garden above Meudon Because you wont be there and
without you I can do nothing What right had this poor wornout shadow
to stand between them to the end Had love and life no claims but only
weakness She had taken all had given nothing It was but reparation
she was making Why stop her

She was alone in a maze of narrow silent streets that ended always in a
high blank wall It seemed impossible to get away from this blank wall
Whatever way she turned she was always coming back to it

What was she to do Drag the woman back to life against her willlead
her back to him to be a chain about his feet until the end Then leave
him to fight the battle alone

And herself All her world had been watching and would know She had
counted her chickens before they were dead She had set her cap at the
man reckoning him already widowed and his wife had come to life and
snatched it from her head She could hear the laughterthe half amused
half contemptuous pity for her rotten bad luck She would be their
standing jest till she was forgotten

What would life leave to her A lonely lodging and a pot of ink that she
would come to hate the smell of She could never marry It would be but
her body that she could give to any other man Not even for the sake of
her dreams could she bring herself to that It might have been possible
before but not now She could have won the victory over herself but
for hope that had kindled the smouldering embers of her passion into
flame What cunning devil had flung open this door showing her all her
hearts desire merely that she should be called upon to slam it to in
her own face

A fierce anger blazed up in her brain Why should she listen Why had
reason been given to us if we were not to use itweigh good and evil in
the balance and decide for ourselves where lay the nobler gain Were we
to be led hither and thither like blind children What was rightwhat
wrong but what our own Godgiven judgment told us Was it wrong of the
woman to perform this act of selfrenunciation yielding up all things to
love No it was greatheroic of her It would be her cross of
victory her crown

If the gift were noble so also it could not be ignoble to accept it

To reject it would be to dishonour it

She would accept it The wonder of it should cast out her doubts and
fears She would seek to make herself worthy of it Consecrate it with
her steadfastness her devotion

She thought it ended But yet she sat there motionless

What was plucking at her sleevestill holding her

Unknowing she had entered a small garden It formed a passage between
two streets and was left open day and night It was but a narrow strip
of rank grass and withered shrubs with an asphalte pathway widening to a
circle in the centre where stood a gas lamp and two seats facing one
another

And suddenly it came to her that this was her Garden of Gethsemane and a
dull laugh broke from her that she could not help It was such a
ridiculous apology for Gethsemane There was not a corner in which one
could possibly pray Only these two iron seats one each side of the
gaunt gas lamp that glared down upon them Even the withered shrubs were
fenced off behind a railing A ragged figure sprawled upon the bench
opposite to her It snored gently and its breath came laden with the
odour of cheap whisky

But it was her Gethsemane the best that Fate had been able to do for
her It was here that her choice would be made She felt that

And there rose before her the vision of that other Garden of Gethsemane
with below it the soft lights of the city shining through the trees
and above clear against the starlit sky the cold dark cross

It was only a little cross hers by comparison She could see that
They seemed to be standing side by side But then she was only a
womanlittle more than a girl And her courage was so small She
thought He ought to know that For her it was quite a big cross She
wondered if He had been listening to all her arguments There was really
a good deal of sense in some of them Perhaps He would understand Not
all His prayer had come down to us He too had put up a fight for
life He too was young For Him also life must have seemed but just
beginning Perhaps He too had felt that His duty still lay among the
peopleteaching guiding healing them To Him too life must have
been sweet with its noble work its loving comradeship Even from Him
the words had to be wrung Thy will not Mine be done

She whispered them at last Not bravely at all Feebly haltingly
with a little sob her forehead pressed against the cold iron seat as if
that could help her

She thought that even then God might reconsider itsee her point of
view Perhaps He would send her a sign

The ragged figure on the bench opposite opened its eyes stared at her
then went to sleep again A prowling cat paused to rub itself against
her foot but meeting no response passed on Through an open window
somewhere near filtered the sound of a childs low whimpering

It was daylight when she awoke She was cold and her limbs ached Slowly
her senses came back to her The seat opposite was vacant The gas lamp
showed but a faint blue point of flame Her dress was torn her boots
soiled and muddy Strands of her hair had escaped from underneath her
hat

She looked at her watch Fortunately it was still early She would be
able to let herself in before anyone was up It was but a little way
She wondered while rearranging her hair what day it was She would
find out when she got home from the newspaper

In the street she paused a moment and looked back through the railings
It seemed even still more sordid in the daylight the sooty grass and the
withered shrubs and the asphalte pathway strewn with dirty paper And
again a laugh she could not help broke from her Her Garden of
Gethsemane

She sent a brief letter round to Phillips and a telegram to the nurse
preparing them for what she meant to do She had just time to pack a
small trunk and catch the morning train At Folkestone she drove first
to a house where she herself had once lodged and fixed things to her
satisfaction The nurse was waiting for her in the downstairs room and
opened the door to her She was opposed to Joans interference But
Joan had come prepared for that Let me have a talk with her she
said I think Ive found out what it is that is causing all the
trouble

The nurse shot her a swift glance Im glad of that she said dryly
She let Joan go upstairs

Mrs Phillips was asleep Joan seated herself beside the bed and waited
She had not yet made herself up for the day and the dyed hair was hidden
beneath a white closefitting cap The pale thin face with its closed
eyes looked strangely young Suddenly the thin hands clasped and her
lips moved as if she were praying in her sleep Perhaps she also was
dreaming of Gethsemane It must be quite a crowded garden if only we
could see it

After a while her eyes opened Joan drew her chair nearer and slipped
her arm in under her and their eyes met

Youre not playing the game whispered Joan shaking her head I only
promised on condition that you would try to get well

The woman made no attempt to deny Something told her that Joan had
learned her secret She glanced towards the door Joan had closed it

Dont drag me back she whispered Its all finished She raised
herself up and put her arms about Joans neck It was hard at first
and I hated you And then it came to me that this was what I had been
wanting to do all my lifesomething to help him that nobody else could
do Dont take it from me

I know whispered Joan Ive been there too I knew you were doing
it though I didnt quite know howtill the other day I wouldnt
think I wanted to pretend that I didnt I know all you can say Ive
been listening to it It was right of you to want to give it all up to
me for his sake But it would be wrong of me to take it I dont quite
see why I cant explain it But I mustnt So you see it would be no
good

But Im so useless pleaded the woman

I said that answered Joan I wanted to do it and I talked and
talked so hard I said everything I could think of But that was the
only answer I mustnt do it

They remained for a while with their arms round one another It struck
Joan as curious even at the time that all feeling of superiority had
gone out of her They might have been two puzzled children that had met
one another on a path that neither knew But Joan was the stronger
character

I want you to give me up that box she said and to come away with me
where I can be with you and take care of you until you are well

Mrs Phillips made yet another effort Have you thought about him she
asked

Joan answered with a faint smile Oh yes she said I didnt forget
that argument in case it hadnt occurred to the Lord

Perhaps she added the helpmate theory was intended to apply only to
our bodies There was nothing said about our souls Perhaps God doesnt
have to work in pairs Perhaps we were meant to stand alone

Mrs Phillipss thin hands were playing nervously with the bed clothes
There still seemed something that she had to say As if Joan hadnt
thought of everything Her eyes were fixed upon the narrow strip of
light between the window curtains

You dont think you could dear she whispered if I didnt do
anything wicked any more But just let things take their course

You see dear she went on her face still turned away I thought it
all finished It will be hard for me to go back to him knowing as I do
now that he doesnt want me I shall always feel that I am in his way
And Hilda she added after a pause she will hate me

Joan looked at the white patient face and was silent What would be the
use of senseless contradiction The woman knew It would only seem an
added stab of mockery She knelt beside the bed and took the thin hands
in hers

I think God must want you very badly she said or He wouldnt have
laid so heavy a cross upon you You will come

The woman did not answer in words The big tears were rolling down her
cheeks There was no paint to mingle with and mar them She drew the
little metal box from under the pillow and gave it into Joans hands

Joan crept out softly from the room

The nurse was standing by the window She turned sharply on Joans
entrance Joan slipped the box into her hands

The nurse raised the lid What a fool Ive been she said I never
thought of that

She held out a large strong hand and gave Joan a longish grip Youre
right she said we must get her out of this house at once Forgive
me

Phillips had been called up north and wired that he would not be able to
get down till the Wednesday evening Joan met him at the station

She wont be expecting you just yet she explained We might have a
little walk

She waited till they had reached a quiet road leading to the hills

You will find her changed she said Mentally I mean Though she
will try not to show it She was dying for your saketo set you free
Hilda seems to have had a talk with her and to have spared her no part of
the truth Her great love for you made the sacrifice possible and even
welcome It was the one gift she had in her hands She was giving it
gladly proudly So far as she was concerned it would have been kinder
to let her make an end of it But during the last few days I have come
to the conclusion there is a law within us that we may not argue with
She is coming back to life knowing you no longer want her that she is
only in the way Perhaps you may be able to think of something to say or
do that will lessen her martyrdom I cant

They had paused where a group of trees threw a blot of shadow across the
moonlit road

You mean she was killing herself he asked

Quite cleverly So as to avoid all danger of after discovery that
might have hurt us she answered

They walked in silence and coming to a road that led back into the town
he turned down it She had the feeling she was following him without his
knowing it A cab was standing outside the gate of a house having just
discharged its fare He seemed to have suddenly recollected her

Do you mind he said We shall get there so much quicker

You go she said Ill stroll on quietly

Youre sure he said

I would rather she answered

It struck her that he was relieved He gave the man the address
speaking hurriedly and jumped in

She had gone on She heard the closing of the door behind her and the
next moment the cab passed her

She did not see him again that night They met in the morning at
breakfast A curious strangeness to each other seemed to have grown up
between them as if they had known one another long ago and had half
forgotten When they had finished she rose to leave but he asked her to
stop and after the table had been cleared he walked up and down the
room while she sat sideways on the window seat from where she could
watch the little ships moving to and fro across the horizon like painted
figures in a show

I had a long talk with Nan last night he said And trying to
explain it to her I came a little nearer to understanding it myself My
love for you would have been strong enough to ruin both of us I see
that now It would have dominated every other thought in me It would
have swallowed up my dreams It would have been blind unscrupulous
Married to you I should have aimed only at success It would not have
been your fault You would not have known About mere birth I should
never have troubled myself Ive met daughters of a hundred earlsmore
or less clever jolly little women I could have chucked under the chin
and have been chummy with Nature creates her own ranks and puts her
ban upon misalliances Every time I took you in my arms I should have
felt that you had stepped down from your proper order to mate yourself
with me and that it was up to me to make the sacrifice good to you by
giving you powerposition Already within the last few weeks when it
looked as if this thing was going to be possible I have been thinking
against my will of a compromise with Carleton that would give me his
support This coming election was beginning to have terrors for me that
I have never before felt The thought of defeathaving to go back to
comparative poverty to comparative obscurity with you as my wife was
growing into a nightmare I should have wanted wealth fame victory
for your saketo see you honoured courted envied finely dressed and
finely housedgrateful to me for having won for you these things It
wasnt honest healthy lovethe love that unites that makes a man
willing to take as well as to give that I felt for you it was worship
that separates a man from a woman that puts fear between them It isnt
good that man should worship a woman He cant serve God and woman
Their interests are liable to clash Nans my helpmatejust a loving
woman that the Lord brought to me and gave me when I was alonethat I
still love I didnt know it till last night She will never stand in
my way I havent to put her against my duty She will leave me free to
obey the voice that calls to me And no man can hear that voice but
himself

He had been speaking in a clear selfconfident tone as if at last he
saw his road before him to the end and felt that nothing else mattered
but that he should go forward hopefully unfalteringly Now he paused
and his eyes wandered But the lines about his strong mouth deepened

Perhaps I am not of the stuff that conquerors are made he went on
Perhaps if I were I should be thinking differently It comes to me
sometimes that I may be one of those intended only to prepare the
waythat for me there may be only the endless struggle I may have to
face unpopularity abuse failure She wont mind

Nor would you he added turning to her suddenly for the first time I
know that But I should be afraidfor you

She had listened to him without interrupting and even now she did not
speak for a while

It was hard not to She wanted to tell him that he was all wrongat
least so far as she was concerned It was not the conqueror she loved
in him it was the fighter Not in the hour of triumph but in the hour
of despair she would have yearned to put her arms about him
Unpopularity abuse failure it was against the fear of such that she
would have guarded him Yes she had dreamed of leadership influence
command But it was the leadership of the valiant few against the hosts
of the oppressors that she claimed Wealth honours Would she have
given up a life of ease shut herself off from society if these had been
her standards _Mesalliance_ Had the male animal no instinct
telling it when it was loved with all a womans being so that any other
union would be her degradation

It was better for him he should think as he did She rose and held out
her hand

I will stay with her for a little while she said Till I feel there
is no more need Then I must get back to work

He looked into her eyes holding her hand and she felt his body
trembling She knew he was about to speak and held up a warning hand

Thats all my lad she said with a smile My love to you and God
speed you

Mrs Phillips progressed slowly but steadily Life was returning to her
but it was not the same Out of those days there had come to her a
gentle dignity a strengthening and refining The face now pale and
drawn had lost its foolishness Under the thin white hair and in
spite of its deep lines it had grown younger A great patience a child
like thoughtfulness had come into the quiet eyes

She was sitting by the window her hands folded Joan had been reading
to her and the chapter finished she had closed the book and her
thoughts had been wandering Mrs Phillipss voice recalled them

Do you remember that day my dear she said when we went furnishing
together And I would have all the wrong things And you let me

Yes answered Joan with a laugh They were pretty awful some of
them

I was just wondering she went on It was a pity wasnt it I was
silly and began to cry

I expect that was it Joan confessed It interferes with our reason
at times

It was only a little thing of course that she answered But Ive
been thinking it must be that thats at the bottom of it all and that is
why God lets there be weak thingschildren and little animals and men
and women in pain that we feel sorry for so that people like you and
Robert and so many others are willing to give up all your lives to
helping them And that is what He wants

Perhaps God cannot help there being weak things answered Joan
Perhaps He too is sorry for them

It comes to the same thing doesnt it dear she answered They are
there anyhow And that is how He knows those who are willing to serve
Him by their being pitiful

They fell into a silence Joan found herself dreaming

Yes it was true It must have been the beginning of all things Man
pitiless deaf blind groping in the darkness knowing not even himself
And to her vision far off out of the mist he shaped himself before
her that dim first standardbearer of the Lord the man who first felt
pity Savage brutish dumblonely there amid the desolation staring
down at some hurt creature man or beast it mattered not his dull eyes
troubled with a strange new pain he understood not

And suddenly as he stooped there must have come a great light into his
eyes

Man had heard Gods voice across the deep and had made answer




CHAPTER XV


The years that followedtill like some shipwrecked swimmer to whom
returning light reveals the land she felt new life and hopes come back
to heralways remained in her memory vague confused a jumble of
events thoughts feelings without sequence or connection

She had gone down to Liverpool intending to persuade her father to leave
the control of the works to Arthur and to come and live with her in
London but had left without broaching the subject There were nights
when she would trapse the streets till she would almost fall exhausted
rather than face the solitude awaiting her in her own rooms But so also
there were moods when like some stricken animal her instinct was to
shun all living things At such times his presence for all his loving
patience would have been as a knife in her wound Besides he would
always be there when escape from herself for a while became an absolute
necessity More and more she had come to regard him as her comforter
Not from anything he ever said or did Rather it seemed to her because
that with him she felt no need of words

The works since Arthur had shared the management had gradually been
regaining their position and he had urged her to let him increase her
allowance

It will give you greater freedom he had suggested with fine assumption
of propounding a mere business proposition enabling you to choose your
work entirely for its own sake I have always wanted to take a hand in
helping things on It will come to just the same your doing it for me

She had suppressed a smile and had accepted Thanks Dad she had
answered It will be nice having you as my backer

Her admiration of the independent woman had undergone some modification
since she had come in contact with her Woman was intended to be
dependent upon man It was the part appointed to him in the social
scheme Woman had hers no less important Earning her own living did
not improve her It was one of the drawbacks of civilization that so
many had to do it of necessity It developed her on the wrong
linesagainst her nature This cry of the unsexed that woman must
always be the paid servant instead of the helper of manpaid for being
mother paid for being wife Why not carry it to its logical conclusion
and insist that she should be paid for her embraces That she should
share in mans labour in his hopes that was the true comradeship What
mattered it who held the pursestrings

Her room was always kept ready for her Often she would lie there
watching the moonlight creep across the floor and a curious feeling
would come to her of being something wandering incomplete She would
see as through a mist the passionate restless child with the rebellious
eyes to whom the room had once belonged and later the strangely self
possessed girl with that impalpable veil of mystery around her who would
stand with folded hands there by the window seeming always to be
listening And she too had passed away The tears would come into her
eyes and she would stretch out yearning arms towards their shadowy
forms But they would only turn upon her eyes that saw not and would
fade away

In the daytime when Arthur and her father were at the works she would
move through the high square stifflyfurnished rooms or about the
great formal garden with its ordered walks and level lawns And as with
knowledge we come to love some old stern face our childish eyes had
thought forbidding and would not have it changed there came to her with
the years a growing fondness for the old plain brickbuilt house
Generations of Allways had lived and died there men and women somewhat
narrow unsympathetic a little hard of understanding but at least
earnest sincere seeking to do their duty in their solid unimaginative
way Perhaps there were other ways besides those of speech and pen
Perhaps one did better keeping to ones own people the very qualities
that separated us from them being intended for their need What mattered
the colours so that one followed the flag Somewhere all roads would
meet

Arthur had to be in London generally once or twice a month and it came
to be accepted that he should always call upon her and take her out
She had lost the selfsufficiency that had made roaming about London by
herself a pleasurable adventure and a newlyborn fear of what people
were saying and thinking about her made her shy even of the few friends
she still clung to so that his visits grew to be of the nature of
childish treats to which she found herself looking forwardcounting the
days Also she came to be dependent upon him for the keeping alight
within her of that little kindly fire of selfconceit at which we warm
our hands in wintry days It is not good that a young woman should
remain for long a stranger to her mirrorabove her frocks indifferent
to the angle of her hat She had met the women superior to feminine
vanities Handsome enough some of them must once have been now sunk in
slovenliness uncleanliness in disrespect to womanhood It would not be
fair to him The worshipper has his rights The goddess must remember
always that she is a goddessmust pull herself together and behave as
such appearing upon her pedestal becomingly attired seeing to it that
in all things she is at her best not allowing private grief to render
her neglectful of this duty

She had not told him of the Phillips episode But she felt instinctively
that he knew It was always a little mysterious to her his perception
in matters pertaining to herself

I want your love she said to him one day It helps me I used to
think it was selfish of me to take it knowing I could never return
itnot that love But I no longer feel that now Your love seems to me
a fountain from which I can drink without hurting you

I should love to be with you always he answered if you wished it
You wont forget your promise

She remembered it then No she answered with a smile I shall keep
watch Perhaps I shall be worthy of it by that time

She had lost her faith in journalism as a drum for the rousing of the
people against wrong Its beat had led too often to the tricksters
booth to the cheapjacks rostrum It had lost its rallying power The
popular Press had made the newspaper a byword for falsehood Even its
supporters while reading it because it pandered to their passions
tickled their vices and flattered their ignorance despised and
disbelieved it Here and there an honest journal advocated a reform
pleaded for the sweeping away of an injustice The public shrugged its
shoulders Another newspaper stunt A bid for popularity for
notoriety with its consequent financial kudos

She still continued to write for Greyson but felt she was labouring for
the doomed Lord Sutcliffe had died suddenly and his holding in the
_Evening Gazette_ had passed to his nephew a gentleman more interested
in big game shooting than in politics Greysons support of Phillips had
brought him within the net of Carletons operations and negotiations for
purchase had already been commenced She knew that sooner or later
Greyson would be offered the alternative of either changing his opinions
or of going And she knew that he would go Her work for Mrs Denton
was less likely to be interfered with It appealed only to the few and
aimed at informing and explaining rather than directly converting Useful
enough work in its way no doubt but to put heart into it seemed to
require longer views than is given to the eyes of youth

Besides her pen was no longer able to absorb her attention to keep her
mind from wandering The solitude of her desk gave her the feeling of a
prison Her body made perpetual claims upon her as though it were some
restless fretful child dragging her out into the streets without
knowing where it wanted to go discontented with everything it did then
hurrying her back to fling itself upon a chair weary but still
dissatisfied

If only she could do something She was sick of thinking

These physical activities into which women were throwing themselves
Where one used ones body as well as ones brainhastened to
appointments gathered round noisy tables met fellow human beings
argued with them walked with them laughing and talking forced ones
way through crowds cheered shouted stood up on platforms before a sea
of faces roused applause filling and emptying ones lungs met
interruptions with swift flash of wit or anger faced opposition
dangerfelt ones blood surging through ones veins felt ones nerves
quivering with excitement felt the delirious thrill of passion felt the
mad joy of the loosened animal

She threw herself into the suffrage movement It satisfied her for a
while She had the rare gift of public speaking and enjoyed her
triumphs She was temperate reasonable persuasive rather than
aggressive feeling her audience as she went never losing touch with
them She had the magnetism that comes of sympathy Medical students
who came intending to tell her to go home and mind the baby remained to
wonder if man really was the undoubted sovereign of the world born to
look upon woman as his willing subject to wonder whether under some
unwritten whispered law it might not be the other way about Perhaps she
had the rightwith or without the babyto move about the kingdom
express her wishes for its care and management Possibly his doubts may
not have been brought about solely by the force and logic of her
arguments Possibly the voice of Nature is not altogether out of place
in discussions upon Humanitys affairs

She wanted votes for women But she wanted them cleanwon without
dishonour These monkey tricksthis apish fury and impatience
Suppose it did hasten by a few months more or less the coming of the
inevitable Suppose by unlawful methods one could succeed in dragging
a reform a little prematurely from the womb of time did not one endanger
the childs health Of what value was womans influence on public
affairs going to be if she was to boast that she had won the right to
exercise it by unscrupulousness and brutality

They were to be found at every corner the reformers who could not reform
themselves The believers in universal brotherhood who hated half the
people The denouncers of tyranny demanding lampposts for their
opponents The bloodthirsty preachers of peace The moralists who had
persuaded themselves that every wrong was justified provided one were
fighting for the right The deaf shouters for justice The excellent
intentioned men and women labouring for reforms that could only be hoped
for when greed and prejudice had yielded place to reason and who sought
to bring about their ends by appeals to passion and selfinterest

And the insincere the selfseekers the selfadvertisers Those who
were in the business for even coarser profit The limelight lovers who
would always say and do the clever the unexpected thing rather than the
useful and the helpful thing to whom paradox was more than principle

Ought there not to be a school for reformers a training college where
could be inculcated selfexamination patience temperance subordination
to duty with lectures on the fundamental laws within which all progress
must be accomplished outside which lay confusion and explosions with
lectures on history showing how improvements had been brought about and
how failure had been invited thus avoiding much waste of reforming zeal
with lectures on the properties and tendencies of human nature
forbidding the attempt to treat it as a sum in rule of three

There were the others The men and women not in the limelight The
lone scattered men and women who saw no flag but Pitys ragged skirt
who heard no drum but the worlds low cry of pain who fought with feeble
hands against the wrong around them who with aching heart and troubled
eyes laboured to make kinder the little space about them The great army
of the nameless reformers uncheered unparagraphed unhonoured The
unknown sowers of the seed Would the reapers of the harvest remember
them

Beyond giving up her visits to the house she had made no attempt to
avoid meeting Phillips and at public functions and at mutual friends
they sometimes found themselves near to one another It surprised her
that she could see him talk to him and even be alone with him without
its troubling her He seemed to belong to a part of her that lay dead
and buriedsomething belonging to her that she had thrust away with her
own hands that she knew would never come back to her

She was still interested in his work and keen to help him It was going
to be a stiff fight He himself in spite of Carletons opposition had
been returned with an increased majority but the Party as a whole had
suffered loss especially in the counties The struggle centred round
the agricultural labourer If he could be won over the Government would
go ahead with Phillipss scheme Otherwise there was danger of its being
shelved The difficulty was the old problem of how to get at the men of
the scattered villages the lonely cottages The only papers that they
ever saw were those chiefly of the Carleton group that the farmers and
the gentry took care should come within their reach that were handed to
them at the end of their days work as a kindly gift given to the school
children to take home with them supplied in ample numbers to all the
little inns and publichouses In all these Phillips was held up as
their arch enemy his proposal explained as a device to lower their
wages decrease their chances of employment and rob them of the produce
of their gardens and allotments No arguments were used A daily stream
of abuse misrepresentation and deliberate lies set forth under flaming
headlines served their simple purpose The one weekly paper that had
got itself established among them that their fathers had always taken
that dimly they had come to look upon as their one friend Carleton had
at last succeeded in purchasing When that too pictured Phillipss
plan as a diabolical intent to take from them even the little that they
had and give it to the loafing socialist and the bloated foreigner no
room for doubt was left to them

He had organized volunteer cycle companies of speakers from the towns
young workingmen and women and students to go out on summer evenings
and hold meetings on the village greens They were winning their way
But it was slow work And Carleton was countering their efforts by a
hired opposition that followed them from place to place and whose
interruptions were made use of to represent the whole campaign as a
fiasco

Hes clever laughed Phillips Id enjoy the fight if Id only
myself to think of and life wasnt so short

The laugh died away and a shadow fell upon his face

If I could get a few of the big landlords to come in on my side he
continued it would make all the difference in the world Theyre
sensible men some of them and the whole thing could be carried out
without injury to any legitimate interest I could make them see that
if I could only get them quietly into a corner

But theyre frightened of me he added with a shrug of his broad
shoulders and I dont seem to know how to tackle them

Those drawingrooms Might not something of the sort be possible Not
perhaps the sumptuous salon of her imagination thronged with the fair
and famous suitably attired Something perhaps more homely more
immediately attainable Some of the women dressed perhaps a little
dowdily not all of them young and beautiful The men wise perhaps
rather than persistently witty a few of them prosy maybe a trifle
ponderous but solid and influential Mrs Dentons great empty house in
Gower Street A central situation and near to the tube Lords and
ladies had once ruffled there trod a measure on its spacious floors
filled its echoing stone hall with their greetings and their partings
The gaping sconces where their linkboys had extinguished their torches
still capped its grim iron railings

Seated in the great sombre library Joan hazarded the suggestion Mrs
Denton might almost have been waiting for it It would be quite easy A
little opening of long fastened windows a lighting of chill grates a
little mending of motheaten curtains a sweeping away of longgathered
dust and cobwebs

Mrs Denton knew just the right people They might be induced to bring
their sons and daughtersit might be their grandchildren youth being
there to welcome them For Joan of course would play her part

The lonely woman touched her lightly on the hand There shot a pleading
look from the old stern eyes

You will have to imagine yourself my daughter she said You are
taller but the colouring was the same You wont mind will you

The right people did come Mrs Denton being a personage that a landed
gentry rendered jumpy by the perpetual explosion of new ideas under
their very feet and casting about eagerly for friends could not afford
to snub A kindly simple folk quite intelligent some of them as
Phillips had surmised Mrs Denton made no mystery of why she had
invited them Why should all questions be left to the politicians and
the journalists Why should not the people interested take a hand meet
and talk over these little matters with quiet voices and attentive ears
amid surroundings where the unwritten law would restrain ladies and
gentlemen from addressing other ladies and gentlemen as bloodsuckers or
anarchists as grinders of the faces of the poor or as oilytongued
rogues arguments not really conducive to mutual understanding and the
bridging over of differences The latest Russian dancer the last new
musical revue the marvellous things that can happen at golf the curious
hands that one picks up at bridge the eternal fox the sacred bird
Excellent material for ninetenths of our conversation But the
remaining tenth Would it be such excruciatingly bad form for us to be
intelligent occasionally say on one or two Fridays during the season
Mrs Denton wrapped it up tactfully but that was her daring suggestion

It took them aback at first There were people who did this sort of
thing People of no class who called themselves names and took up
things But for people of social standing to talk about serious
subjectsexcept perhaps in bed to ones wife It sounded so
unEnglish

With the elders it was sense of duty that prevailed That at all
events was English The country must be saved To their sons and
daughters it was the originality the novelty that gradually appealed
Mrs Dentons Fridays became a new sensation It came to be the chic and
proper thing to appear at them in shades of mauve or purple A pushing
little woman in Hanover Street designed the Denton bodice with hanging
sleeves and squarecut neck The younger men inclined towards a coat
shaped to the waist with a roll collar

Joan sighed It looked as if the word had been passed round to treat the
whole thing as a joke Mrs Denton took a different view

Nothing better could have happened she was of opinion It means that
their hearts are in it

The stone hall was still vibrating to the voices of the last departed
guests Joan was seated on a footstool before the fire in front of Mrs
Dentons chair

Its the thing that gives me greatest hope she continued The
childishness of men and women It means that the world is still young
still teachable

But theyre so slow at their lessons grumbled Joan One repeats it
and repeats it and then when one feels that surely now at least one has
drummed it into their heads one finds they have forgotten all that one
has ever said

Not always forgotten answered Mrs Denton mislaid it may be for
the moment An Indian student the son of an old Rajah called on me a
little while ago He was going back to organize a system of education
among his people My father heard you speak when you were over in
India he told me He has always been thinking about it Thirty
years ago it must have been that I undertook that mission to India I
had always looked back upon it as one of my many failures

But why leave it to his son argued Joan Why couldnt the old man
have set about it himself instead of wasting thirty precious years

I should have preferred it myself agreed Mrs Denton I remember
when I was a very little girl my mother longing for a tree upon the lawn
underneath which she could sit I found an acorn and planted it just in
the right spot I thought I would surprise her I happened to be in the
neighbourhood last summer and I walked over There was such a nice old
lady sitting under it knitting stockings So you see it wasnt wasted

I wouldnt mind the waiting answered Joan if it were not for the
sorrow and the suffering that I see all round me I want to get rid of
it right away now I could be patient for myself but not for others

The little old lady straightened herself There came a hardening of the
thin firm mouth

And those that have gone before she demanded Those that have won
the ground from where we are fighting Had they no need of patience Was
the cry never wrung from their lips How long oh Lord how long Is
it for us to lay aside the sword that they bequeath us because we cannot
hope any more than they to see the faroff victory Fifty years I have
fought and what a few years hence will my closing eyes still see but
the banners of the foe still waving fresh armies pouring to his
standard

She flung back her head and the grim mouth broke into a smile

But Ive won she said Im dying further forward Ive helped
advance the line

She put out her hands and drew Joan to her

Let me think of you she said as taking my place pushing the
outposts a little further on

Joan did not meet Hilda again till the child had grown into a
womanpractically speaking She had always been years older than her
age It was at a reception given in the Foreign Office Joans dress
had been trodden on and torn She had struggled out of the crowd into an
empty room and was examining the damage somewhat ruefully when she
heard a voice behind her proffering help It was a hard cold voice
that yet sounded familiar and she turned

There was no forgetting those deep burning eyes though the face had
changed The thin red lips still remained its one touch of colour but
the unhealthy whiteness of the skin had given place to a delicate pallor
and the features that had been indistinct had shaped themselves in fine
firm lines It was a beautiful arresting face marred only by the
sullen callousness of the dark clouded eyes

Joan was glad of the assistance Hilda produced pins

I always come prepared to these scrimmages she explained Ive got
some Hazeline in my bag They havent kicked you have they

No laughed Joan At least I dont think so

They do sometimes answered Hilda if you happen to be in the way
near the feeding troughs If theyd only put all the refreshments into
one room one could avoid it But they will scatter them about so that
one never knows for certain whether one is in the danger zone or not I
hate a mob

Why do you come asked Joan

Oh I answered the girl I go everywhere where theres a chance of
picking up a swell husband Theyve got to come to these shows they
cant help themselves One never knows what incident may give one ones
opportunity

Joan shot a glance The girl was evidently serious

You think it would prove a useful alliance she suggested

It would help undoubtedly the girl answered I dont see any other
way of getting hold of them

Joan seated herself on one of the chairs ranged round the walls and drew
the girl down beside her Through the closed door the mingled voices of
the Foreign Secretarys guests sounded curiously like the buzzing of
flies

Its quite easy said Joan with your beauty Especially if youre
not going to be particular But isnt there danger of your devotion to
your father leading you too far A marriage founded on a lieno matter
for what purposemustnt it degrade a womansmirch her soul for all
time We have a right to give up the things that belong to ourselves
but not the things that belong to God our truth our sincerity our
cleanliness of mind and body the things that He may one day want of us
It led you into evil once before Dont think Im judging you I was no
better than you I argued just as you must have done Something stopped
me just in time That was the only difference between us

The girl turned her dark eyes full upon Joan What did stop you she
demanded

Does it matter what we call it answered Joan It was a voice

It told me to do it answered the girl

Did no other voice speak to you asked Joan

Yes answered the girl The voice of weakness

There came a fierce anger into the dark eyes Why did you listen to
it she demanded All would have been easy if you hadnt

You mean answered Joan quietly that if I had let your mother die and
had married your father that he and I would have loved each other to the
end that I should have helped him and encouraged him in all things so
that his success would have been certain Is that the argument

Didnt you love him asked the girl staring Wouldnt you have
helped him

I cant tell answered Joan I should have meant to Many men and
women have loved and have meant to help each other all their lives and
with the years have drifted asunder coming even to be against one
another We change and our thoughts change slight differences of
temperament grow into barriers between us unguessed antagonisms widen
into gulfs Accidents come into our lives A friend was telling me the
other day of a woman who practically proposed to and married a musical
genius purely and solely to be of use to him She earned quite a big
income drawing fashions and her idea was to relieve him of the
necessity of doing potboilers for a living so that he might devote his
whole time to his real work And a few weeks after they were married she
ran the point of a lead pencil through her eye and it set up inflammation
of her brain And now all the poor fellow has to think of is how to make
enough to pay for her keep at a private lunatic asylum I dont mean to
be flippant Its the very absurdity of it all that makes the mystery of
lifethat renders it so hopeless for us to attempt to find our way
through it by our own judgment It is like the ants making all their
clever laborious plans knowing nothing of chickens and the gardeners
spade That is why we have to cling to the life we can order for
ourselvesthe life within us Truth Justice Pity They are the
strong things the eternal things the things weve got to sacrifice
ourselves forserve with our bodies and our souls

Dont think me a prig she pleaded Im talking as if I knew all
about it I dont really I grope in the dark and now and thenat
least so it seems to meI catch a glint of light We are powerless in
ourselves It is only God working through us that enables us to be of
any use All we can do is to keep ourselves kind and clean and free from
self waiting for Him to come to us

The girl rose I must be getting back she said Dad will be
wondering where Ive got to

She paused with the door in her hand and a faint smile played round the
thin red lips

Tell me she said What is God

A Labourer together with man according to Saint Paul Joan answered

The girl turned and went Joan watched her as she descended the great
staircase She moved with a curious gliding motion pausing at times
for the people to make way for her




CHAPTER XVI


It was a summers evening Joan had dropped in at the Greysons and had
found Mary alone Francis not having yet returned from a bachelor dinner
at his uncles who was some big pot in the Navy They sat in the
twilight facing the open French windows through which one caught a
glimpse of the park A great stillness seemed to be around them

The sale and purchase of the _Evening Gazette_ had been completed a few
days before Greyson had been offered the alternative of gradually and
gracefully changing his opinions or getting out and had of course
chosen dismissal He was taking a holiday as Mary explained with a
short laugh

He had some shares in it himself hadnt he Joan asked

Oh just enough to be of no use Mary answered Carleton was rather
decent so far as that part of it was concerned and insisted on paying
him a fair price The market value would have been much less and he
wanted to be out of it

Joan remained silent It made her mad that a man could be suddenly
robbed of fifteen years labour the weapon that his heart and brain had
made keen wrested from his hand by a legal process and turned against
the very principles for which all his life he had been fighting

Im almost more sorry for myself than for him said Mary making a
whimsical grimace He will start something else so soon as hes got
over his first soreness but Im too old to dream of another child

He came in a little later and seating himself between them filled and
lighted his pipe Looking back Joan remembered that curiously none of
them had spoken Mary had turned at the sound of his key in the door
She seemed to be watching him intently but it was too dark to notice her
expression He pulled at his pipe till it was well alight and then
removed it

Its war he said

The words made no immediate impression upon Joan There had been
rumours threatenings and alarms newspaper talk But so there had been
before It would come one day the world war that one felt was gathering
in the air that would burst like a second deluge on the nations But it
would not be in our time it was too big A way out would be found

Is there no hope asked Mary

Yes he answered The hope that a miracle may happen The Navys got
its orders

And suddenlyas years before in a Paris music hallthere leapt to life
within Joans brain a little impish creature that took possession of her
She hoped the miracle would not happen The little impish creature
within her brain was marching up and down beating a drum She wished he
would stop a minute Someone was trying to talk to her telling her she
ought to be tremendously shocked and grieved Heor she or whatever it
was that was trying to talk to her appeared concerned about Reason and
Pity and Universal Brotherhood and Civilizations clockthings like
that But the little impish drummer was making such a din she couldnt
properly hear Later on perhaps he would get tired and then she would
be able to listen to this humane and sensible person whoever it might
be

Mary argued that England could and should keep out of it but Greyson was
convinced it would be impossible not to say dishonourable a sentiment
that won the enthusiastic approval of the little drummer in Joans brain
He played Rule Britannia and God Save the King the Marseillaise
and the Russian National hymn all at the same time He would have
included Deutschland uber Alles if Joan hadnt made a supreme effort
and stopped him Evidently a sporting little devil He took himself off
into a corner after a time where he played quietly to himself and Joan
was able to join in the conversation

Greyson spoke with an enthusiasm that was unusual to him So many of our
wars had been mean warswars for the wrong sordid wars for territory
for gold mines wars against the weak at the bidding of our traders our
financiers Shouldering the white mans burden we called it Wars
for the right of selling opium wars to perpetuate the vile rule of the
Turk because it happened to serve our commercial interests This time
we were out to play the knight to save the smaller peoples to rescue
our once sweet enemy fair France Russia was the disturbing thought
It somewhat discounted the knighterrant idea riding stirrup to stirrup
beside that barbarian horseman But there were possibilities about
Russia Idealism lay hid within that sleeping brain It would be a holy
war for the Kingdom of the Peoples With Germany freed from the monster
of blood and iron that was crushing out her soul with Russia awakened to
life we would build the United States of Europe Even his voice was
changed Joan could almost fancy it was some excited schoolboy that was
talking

Mary had been clasping and unclasping her hands a habit of hers when
troubled Could good ever come out of evil That was her doubt Did
war ever do anything but sow the seeds of future violence substitute one
injustice for another change wrong for wrong Did it ever do anything
but add to the worlds sum of evil making Gods task the heavier

Suddenly while speaking she fell into a passionate fit of weeping She
went on through her tears

It will be terrible she said It will last longer than you say
Every nation will be drawn into it There will be no voice left to speak
for reason Every day we shall grow more brutalized more pitiless It
will degrade us crush the soul out of us Blood and iron It will
become our God too the God of all the world You say we are going into
it with clean hands this time How long will they keep clean The
people who only live for making money how long do you think they will
remain silent What has been all the talk of the last ten years but of
capturing German trade We shall be told that we owe it to our dead to
make a profit out of them that otherwise they will have died in vain
Who will care for the people but to use them for killing one anotherto
hound them on like dogs In every country nothing but greed and hatred
will be preached Horrible men and women will write to the papers crying
out for more blood more cruelty Everything that can make for anger and
revenge will be screamed from every newspaper Every plea for humanity
will be jeered at as sickly sentimentality Every man and woman who
remembers the ideals with which we started will be shrieked at as a
traitor The people who are doing well out of it they will get hold of
the Press appeal to the passions of the mob Nobody else will be
allowed to speak It always has been so in war It always will be This
will be no exception merely because its bigger Every country will be
given over to savagery There will be no appeal against it The whole
world will sink back into the beast

She ended by rising abruptly and wishing them goodnight Her outburst
had silenced Joans impish drummer for the time He appeared to be
nervous and depressed but bucked up again on the way to the bus Greyson
walked with her as usual They took the long way round by the outer
circle

Poor Mary he said I should not have talked before her if I had
thought Her horror of war is almost physical She will not even read
about them It has the same effect upon her as stories of cruelty

But theres truth in a good deal that she says he added War can
bring out all that is best in a people but also it brings out the worst
We shall have to take care that the ideals are not lost sight of

I wish this wretched business of the paper hadnt come just at this
time said Joan just when your voice is most needed

Couldnt you get enough money together to start something quickly she
continued the idea suddenly coming to her I think I could help you
It wouldnt matter its being something small to begin with So long as
it was entirely your own and couldnt be taken away from you Youd
soon work it up

Thanks he answered I may ask you to later on But just now He
paused

Of course For war you wanted men to fight She had been thinking of
them in the lump hurrying masses such as one sees on cinema screens
blurred but picturesque Of course when you came to think of it they
would have to be made up of individualsgallanthearted boyish sort of
men who would pass through doors one at a time into little rooms give
their name and address to a soldier man seated at a big deal table Later
on one would say goodbye to them on crowded platforms wave a
handkerchief Not all of them would come back You cant make
omelettes without breaking eggs she told herself

It annoyed her that silly saying having come into her mind She could
see them lying there with their white faces to the night Surely she
might have thought of some remark less idiotic to make to herself at
such a time

He was explaining to her things about the air service It seemed he had
had experience in flyingsome relation of his with whom he had spent a
holiday last summer

It would mean his getting out quickly He seemed quite eager to be gone

Isnt it rather dangerous work she asked She felt it was a footling
question even as she asked it Her brain had become stodgy

Nothing like as dangerous as being in the Infantry he answered And
that would be my only other alternative Besides I get out of the
drilling He laughed I should hate being shouted at and ordered
about by a husky old sergeant

They neither spoke again till they came to the bridge from the other
side of which the busses started

I may not see you again before I go he said Look after Mary I
shall try to persuade her to go down to her aunt in Hampshire Its
rather a bit of luck as it turns out the paper being finished with I
shouldnt have quite known what to do

He had stopped at the corner They were still beneath the shadow of the
trees Quite unconsciously she put her face up and as if it had always
been the custom at their partings he drew her to him and kissed her
though it really was for the first time

She walked home instead of taking the bus She wanted to think A day
or two would decide the question She determined that if the miracle did
not happen she would go down to Liverpool Her father was on the
committee of one of the great hospitals and she knew one or two of the
matrons She would want to be doing somethingto get out to the front
if possible Maybe her desire to serve was not altogether free from
curiosityfrom the craving for adventure Theres a spice of the man
even in the best of women

Her conscience plagued her when she thought of Mrs Denton For some
time now they had been very close together and the old lady had come to
depend upon her She waited till all doubt was ended before calling to
say goodbye Mrs Denton was seated before an old bureau that had long
stood locked in a corner of the library The drawers were open and books
and papers were scattered about

Joan told her plans Youll be able to get along without me for a
little while she asked doubtfully

Mrs Denton laughed I havent much more to do she answered Just
tidying up as you see and two or three halffinished things I shall try
to complete After that Ill perhaps take a rest

She took from among the litter a faded photograph and handed it to Joan
Odd she said Ive just turned it out

It represented a long thin line of eminently respectable ladies and
gentlemen in early Victorian costume The men in pegtop trousers and
silk stocks the women in crinolines and poke bonnets Among them
holding the hand of a benevolentlooking stoutish gentleman was a mere
girl The terminating frills of a white unmentionable garment showed
beneath her skirts She wore a porkpie hat with a feather in it

My first public appearance explained Mrs Denton I teased my father
into taking me with him We represented Great Britain and Ireland I
suppose Im the only one left

I shouldnt have recognized you laughed Joan What was the
occasion

The great International Peace Congress at Paris explained Mrs Denton
just after the Crimean war It made quite a stir at the time The
Emperor opened our proceedings in person and the Pope and the Archbishop
of Canterbury both sent us their blessing We had a copy of the speeches
presented to us on leaving in every known language in Europe bound in
vellum Im hoping to find it And the Press was enthusiastic There
were to be Acts of Parliament Courts of Arbitration International Laws
Diplomatic Treaties A SubCommittee was appointed to prepare a special
set of prayers and a Palace of Peace was to be erected There was only
one thing we forgot and that was the foundation

I may not be here she continued when the new plans are submitted
Tell them not to forget the foundation this time Tell them to teach the
children

Joan dined at a popular restaurant that evening She fancied it might
cheer her up But the noisy patriotism of the overfed crowd only
irritated her These elderly flabby men these fleshy women who would
form the spectators who would loll on their cushioned seats protected
from the sun munching contentedly from their wellprovided baskets while
listening to the dying groans rising upwards from the drenched arena She
glanced from one podgy thumb to another and a feeling of nausea crept
over her

Suddenly the band struck up God Save the King Three commonplace
enough young men seated at a table near to her laid down their napkins
and stood up Yes there was something to be said for war she felt as
she looked at their boyish faces transfigured Not for them Business as
usual the Capture of German Trade Other visions those young eyes were
seeing The little imp within her brain had seized his drum again
Follow meso he seemed to beatI teach men courage duty the laying
down of self I open the gates of honour I make heroes out of dust
Isnt it worth my price

A figure was loitering the other side of the street when she reached
home She thought she somehow recognized it and crossed over It was
McKean smoking his everlasting pipe Success having demanded some such
change he had migrated to The Albany and she had not seen him for
some time He had come to have a last look at the housein case it
might happen to be the last He was off to Scotland the next morning
where he intended to join up

But are you sure its your particular duty suggested Joan Im told
youve become a household word both in Germany and France If we really
are out to end war and establish the brotherhood of nations the work you
are doing is of more importance than even the killing of Germans It
isnt as if there wouldnt be enough without you

To tell the truth he answered thats exactly what Ive been saying
to myself I shant be any good I dont see myself sticking a bayonet
into even a German Unless he happened to be abnormally clumsy I tried
to shoot a rabbit once I might have done it if the little beggar
instead of running away hadnt turned and looked at me

I should keep out of it if I were you laughed Joan

I cant he answered Im too great a coward

An odd reason for enlisting thought Joan

I couldnt face it he went on the way people would be looking at me
in trains and omnibuses the things people would say of me the things I
should imagine they were saying what my valet would be thinking of me
Oh Im ashamed enough of myself Its the artistic temperament I
suppose We must always be admired praised Were not the stuff that
martyrs are made of We must for ever be kowtowing to the cackling
geese around us Were so terrified lest they should hiss us

The street was empty They were pacing it slowly up and down

Ive always been a coward he continued I fell in love with you the
first day I met you on the stairs But I dared not tell you

You didnt give me that impression answered Joan

She had always found it difficult to know when to take him seriously and
when not

I was so afraid you would find it out he explained

You thought I would take advantage of it she suggested

One can never be sure of a woman he answered And it would have been
so difficult There was a girl down in Scotland one of the village
girls It wasnt anything really We had just been children together
But they all thought I had gone away to make my fortune so as to come
back and marry hereven my mother It would have looked so mean if
after getting on I had married a fine London lady I could never have
gone home again

But you havent married heror have you asked Joan

No he answered She wrote me a beautiful letter that I shall always
keep begging me to forgive her and hoping I might be happy She had
married a young farmer and was going out to Canada My mother will
never allow her name to be mentioned in our house

They had reached the end of the street again Joan held out her hand
with a laugh

Thanks for the compliment she said Though I notice you wait till
youre going away before telling me

But quite seriously she added give it a little more thoughtthe
enlisting I mean The world isnt too rich in kind influences It
needs men like you Come pull yourself together and show a little
pluck She laughed

Ill try he promised but it wont be any use I shall drift about
the streets seeking to put heart into myself but all the while my
footsteps will be bearing me nearer and nearer to the recruiting office
and outside the door some girl in the crowd will smile approval or some
old fool will pat me on the shoulder and I shall sneak in and it will
close behind me It must be fine to have courage

He wrote her two days later from Ayr giving her the name of his
regiment and again some six months later from Flanders But there would
have been no sense in her replying to that last

She lingered in the street by herself a little time after he had turned
the corner It had been a house of sorrow and disappointment to her but
so also she had dreamed her dreams there seen her visions She had
never made much headway with her landlord and her landlady a worthy
couple who had proved most excellent servants but who prided
themselves to use their own expression on knowing their place and
keeping themselves to themselves Joan had given them notice that
morning and had been surprised at the womans bursting into tears

I felt it just the same when young Mr McKean left us she explained
with apologies He had been with us five years He was like you miss
so unpracticable Id got used to looking after him

Mary Greyson called on her in the morning while she was still at
breakfast She had come from seeing Francis off by an early train from
Euston He had sent Joan a ring

He is so afraid you may not be able to wear itthat it will not fit
you said Mary but I told him I was sure it would

Joan held our her hand for the letter I was afraid he had forgotten
it she answered with a smile

She placed the ring on her finger and held out her hand I might have
been measured for it she said I wonder how he knew

You left a glove behind you the first day you ever came to our house
Mary explained And I kept it

She was following his wishes and going down into the country They did
not meet again until after the war

Madge dropped in on her during the week and brought Flossie with her
Flossies husband Sam had departed for the Navy and Niel Singleton
who had offered and been rejected for the Army had joined a Red Cross
unit Madge herself was taking up canteen work Joan rather expected
Flossie to be in favour of the war and Madge against it Instead of
which it turned out the other way round It seemed difficult to
forecast opinion in this matter

Madge thought that England in particular had been too much given up to
luxury and pleasure There had been too much idleness and empty
laughter Hitchicoo dances and women undressing themselves upon the
stage Even the working classes seemed to think of nothing else but
cinemas and beer She dreamed of a United Kingdom purified by suffering
cleansed by tears its people drawn together by memory of common
sacrifice class antagonism buried in the grave where Dukes son and
cooks son would lie side by side of a newborn Europe rising from the
ashes of the old With Germany beaten her lust of war burnt out her
hideous doctrine of Force proved to be false the world would breathe a
freer air Passion and hatred would fall from mans eyes The people
would see one another and join hands

Flossie was sceptical Why hasnt it done it before she wanted to
know Good Lord Theres been enough of it

Why didnt we all kiss and be friends after the Napoleonic wars she
demanded instead of getting up Peterloo massacres and antiCorn Law
riots and breaking the Duke of Wellingtons windows

All this talk of downing Militarism she continued Its like trying
to do away with the other sort of disorderly house You dont stamp out
a vice by chivying it round the corner When men and women have become
decent there will be no more disorderly houses But it wont come
before Suppose we do knock Militarism out of Germany like we did out
of France not so very long ago It will only slip round the corner into
Russia or Japan Come and settle over here as likely as not especially
if we have a few victories and get to fancy ourselves

Madge was of opinion that the world would have had enough of war Not
armies but whole peoples would be involved this time The lesson would
be driven home

Oh yes we shall have had enough of it agreed Flossie by the time
weve paid up Theres no doubt of that What about our children Ive
just left young Frank strutting all over the house and flourishing a
paper knife And the servants have had to bar the kitchen door to
prevent his bursting in every five minutes and attacking them Whats he
going to say when I tell him later on that his father and myself have
had all the war we want and have decided there shall be no more The
old folks have had their fun Why shouldnt I have mine That will be
his argument

You cant do it she concluded unless you are prepared to keep half
the worlds literature away from the children scrap half your music
edit your museums and your picture galleries bowdlerize your Old
Testament and rewrite your histories And then youll have to be careful
for twentyfour hours a day that they never see a dogfight

Madge still held to her hope God would make a wind of reason to pass
over the earth He would not smite again his people

I wish poor dear Sam could have been kept out of it said Flossie She
wiped her eyes and finished her tea

Joan had arranged to leave on the Monday She ran down to see Mary
Stopperton on the Saturday afternoon Mr Stopperton had died the year
before and Mary had been a little hurt divining insincerity in the
condolences offered to her by most of her friends

You didnt know him dear she had said to Joan All his faults were
on the outside

She did not want to talk about the war

Perhaps its wrong of me she said But it makes me so sad And I
can do nothing

She had been busy at her machine when Joan had entered and a pile of
delicate white work lay folded on a chair beside her

What are you making asked Joan

The little withered face lighted up Guess she said as she unfolded
and displayed a tiny garment

I so love making them she said I say to myself It will all come
right God will send more and more of His Christ babies till at last
there will be thousands and thousands of them everywhere and their love
will change the world

Her bright eyes had caught sight of the ring upon Joans hand She
touched it with her little fragile fingers

You will let me make one for you dearie wont you she said I feel
sure it will be a little Christ baby

Arthur was still away when she arrived home He had gone to Norway on
business Her father was afraid he would find it difficult to get back
Telegraphic communication had been stopped and they had had no news of
him Her father was worried A big Government contract had come in
while many of his best men had left to enlist

Ive fixed you up all right at the hospital he said It was good of
you to think of coming home Dont go away for a bit It was the
first time he had asked anything of her

Another fortnight passed before they heard from Arthur and then he wrote
them both from Hull He would be somewhere in the North Sea mine
sweeping when they read his letters He had hoped to get a day or two
to run across and say goodbye but the need for men was pressing and he
had not liked to plead excuses The boat by which he had managed to
leave Bergen had gone down He and a few others had been picked up but
the sights that he had seen were haunting him He felt sure his uncle
would agree that he ought to be helping and this was work for England he
could do with all his heart He hoped he was not leaving his uncle in
the lurch but he did not think the war would last long and he would
soon be back

Dear lad said her father he would take the most dangerous work that
he could find But I wish he hadnt been quite so impulsive He could
have been of more use helping me with this War Office contract I
suppose he never got my letter telling him about it

In his letter to Joan he went further He had received his uncles
letter so he confided to her Perhaps she would think him a crank but
he couldnt help it He hated this killing business this making of
machinery for slaughtering men in bulk like they killed pigs in Chicago
Out on the free sweet sea helping to keep it clean from mans
abominations he would be away from it all

She saw the vision of him that night as leaning from her window she
looked out beyond the pines the little lonely ship amid the waste of
waters his beautiful almost womanish face and the gentle dreamy eyes
with their haunting suggestion of a shadow

Her little drummer played less and less frequently to her as the months
passed by It didnt seem to be the war he had looked forward to The
illustrated papers continued to picture it as a sort of glorified picnic
where smiling young men lolled luxuriously in cosy dugouts reading
their favourite paper By curious coincidence it generally happened to
be the journal publishing the photograph Occasionally it appeared
they came across the enemy who then put up both hands and shouted
Kamerad But the weary wounded men she talked to told another story

She grew impatient of the fighters with their mouths the savage old
baldheads heroically prepared to sacrifice the last young man the sleek
purring women who talked childish nonsense about killing every man woman
and child in Germany but quite meant it the shrieking journalists who
had decided that their place was the home front the pressspurred mobs
the spy hunters chasing terrified old men and sobbing children through
the streets It was a relief to enter the quiet ward and close the door
behind her The campfollowers the traders and pedlars the
balladmongers and the mountebanks the ghoulish sightseers War brought
out all that was worst in them But the givers of their blood the lads
who suffered who had made the sacrifice war had taught them chivalry
manhood She heard no revilings of hatred and revenge from those drawn
lips Patience humour forgiveness they had learnt from war They
told her kindly stories even of Hans and Fritz

The little drummer in her brain would creep out of his corner play to
her softly while she moved about among them

One day she received a letter from Folk He had come to London at the
request of the French Government to consult with English artists on a
matter he must not mention He would not have the time he told her to
run down to Liverpool Could she get a couple of days leave and dine
with him in London

She found him in the uniform of a French Colonel He had quite a
military bearing and seemed pleased with himself He kissed her hand
and then held her out at arms length

Its wonderful how like you are to your mother he said I wish I were
as young as I feel

She had written him at the beginning of the war telling him of her wish
to get out to the front and he thought that now he might be able to help
her

But perhaps youve changed your mind he said It isnt quite as
pretty as its painted

I want to she answered It isnt all curiosity I think its time
for women to insist on seeing war with their own eyes not trust any
longer to the pictures you men paint She smiled

But Ive got to give it up she added I cant leave Dad

They were sitting in the hall of the hotel It was the dressing hour and
the place was almost empty He shot a swift glance at her

Arthur is still away she explained and I feel that he wants me I
should be worrying myself thinking of him all alone with no one to look
after him Its the mother instinct I suppose It always has hampered
woman She laughed

Dear old boy he said He was watching her with a little smile Im
glad hes got some luck at last

They dined in the great restaurant belonging to the hotel He was still
vastly pleased with himself as he marched up the crowded room with Joan
upon his arm He held himself upright and talked and laughed perhaps
louder than an elderly gentleman should Swaggering old beggar he
must have overheard a young sub mutter as they passed But he did not
seem to mind it

They lingered over the meal Folk was a brilliant talker Most of the
men whose names were filling the newspapers had sat to him at one time or
another He made them seem quite human Joan was surprised at the time

Come up to my rooms will you he asked Theres something I want to
say to you And then Ill walk back with you She was staying at a
small hotel off Jermyn Street

He sat her down by the fire and went into the next room He had a letter
in his hand when he returned Joan noticed that the envelope was written
upon across the corner but she was not near enough to distinguish the
handwriting He placed it on the mantelpiece and sat down opposite her

So you have come to love the dear old chap he said

I have always loved him Joan answered It was he didnt love me for
a time as I thought But I know now that he does

He was silent for a few moments and then he leant across and took her
hands in his

I am going he said where there is just the possibility of an
accident one never knows I wanted to be sure that all was well with
you

He was looking at the ring upon her hand

A soldier boy he asked

Yes she answered If he comes back There was a little catch in
her voice

I know hell come back he said I wont tell you why I am so sure
Perhaps you wouldnt believe He was still holding her hands looking
into her eyes

Tell me he said did you see your mother before she died Did she
speak to you

No Joan answered I was too late She had died the night before I
hardly recognized her when I saw her She looked so sweet and young

She loved you very dearly he said Better than herself All those
years of sorrow they came to her because of that I thought it foolish
of her at the time but now I know she was wise I want you always to
love and honour her I wouldnt ask you if it wasnt right

She looked at him and smiled Its quite easy she answered I
always see her as she lay there with all the sorrow gone from her She
looked so beautiful and kind

He rose and took the letter from where he had placed it on the
mantelpiece He stooped and held it out above the fire and a little
flame leaped up and seemed to take it from his hand

They neither spoke during the short walk between the two hotels But at
the door she turned and held out her hands to him

Thank you she said for being so kindand wise I shall always love
and honour her

He kissed her promising to take care of himself

She ran against Phillips the next day at one of the big stores where
she was shopping He had obtained a commission early in the war and was
now a captain He had just come back from the front on leave The
alternative had not appealed to him of being one of those responsible
for sending other men to death while remaining himself in security and
comfort

Its a matter of temperament he said Somebodys got to stop behind
and do the patriotic speechifying Im glad I didnt Especially after
what Ive seen

He had lost interest in politics

Theres something bigger coming he said Here everything seems to be
going on much the same but over there you feel it Something growing
silently out of all this blood and mud I find myself wondering what the
men are staring at but when I look theres nothing as far as my field
glasses will reach but waste and desolation And it isnt only on the
faces of our own men Its in the eyes of the prisoners too As if they
saw something A funny ending to the war if the people began to think

Mrs Phillips was running a Convalescent Home in Folkestone he told her
and had even made a speech Hilda was doing relief work among the ruined
villages of France

Its a new world we shall be called upon to build he said We must
pay more heed to the foundation this time

She seldom discussed the war with her father At the beginning he had
dreamed with Greyson of a short and glorious campaign that should weld
all classes together and after which we should forgive our enemies and
shape with them a better world But as the months went by he appeared
to grow indifferent and Joan who got about twelve hours a day of it
outside welcomed other subjects

It surprised her when one evening after dinner he introduced it himself

What are you going to do when its over he asked her You wont give
up the fight will you whatever happens She had not known till then
that he had been taking any interest in her work

No she answered with a laugh no matter what happens I shall always
want to be in it

Good lad he said patting her on the shoulder It will be an ugly
world that will come out of all this hate and anger The Lord will want
all the help that He can get

And you dont forget our compact do you he continued that I am to
be your backer I want to be in it too

She shot a glance at him He was looking at the portrait of that old
Ironside Allway who had fought and died to make a nobler England as he
had dreamed A grim unprepossessing gentleman unless the artist had
done him much injustice with high narrow forehead and puzzled staring
eyes

She took the cigarette from her lips and her voice trembled a little

I want you to be something more to me than that sir she said I
want to feel that Im an Allway fighting for the things weve always had
at heart Ill try and be worthy of the name

Her hand stole out to him across the table but she kept her face away
from him Until she felt his grasp grow tight and then she turned and
their eyes met

Youll be the last of the name he said Something tells me that Im
glad youre a fighter I always prayed my child might be a fighter

Arthur had not been home since the beginning of the war Twice he had
written them to expect him but the little fleet of mine sweepers had
been hard pressed and on both occasions his leave had been stopped at
the last moment One afternoon he turned up unexpectedly at the
hospital It was a few weeks after the Conscription Act had been passed

Joan took him into her room at the end of the ward from where through
the open door she could still keep watch They spoke in low tones

Its done you good said Joan You look every inch the jolly Jack
Tar He was hard and tanned and his eyes were marvellously bright

Yes he said I love the sea Its clean and strong

A fear was creeping over her Why have you come back she asked

He hesitated keeping his eyes upon the ground

I dont suppose you will agree with me he said Somehow I felt I had
to

A Conscientious Objector She might have guessed it A Conchy as
they would call him in the Press all the spiteful screamers who had
never risked a scratch themselves denouncing him as a coward The
local Dogberrys of the tribunals would fire off their little stock of
gibes and platitudes upon him propound with owlish solemnity the new
Christianity abuse him and condemn him without listening to him
Jeering mobs would follow him through the streets More than once of
late she had encountered such crowds made up of shrieking girls and foul
mouthed men surging round some whitefaced youngster while the
welldressed passersby looked on and grinned

She came to him and stood over him with her hands upon his shoulders

Must you dear she said Cant you reconcile it to yourselfto go
on with your work of mercy of saving poor folks lives

He raised his eyes to hers The shadow that to her fancy had always
rested there seemed to have departed A light had come to them

There are more important things than saving mens bodies You think
that dont you he asked

Yes she answered I wont try to hold you back dear if you think
you can do that

He caught her hands and held them

I wanted to be a coward he said to keep out of the fight I thought
of the shame of the petty persecutionsthat even you might despise me
But I couldnt I was always seeing His face before me with His
beautiful tender eyes and the blood drops on His brow It is He alone
can save the world It is perishing for want of love and by a little
suffering I might be able to help Him And then one nightI suppose it
was a piece of driftwoodthere rose up out of the sea a little cross
that seemed to call to me to stretch out my hand and grasp it and gird
it to my side

He had risen Dont you see he said It is only by suffering that
one can help Him It is the sword that He has chosenby which one day
He will conquer the world And this is such a splendid opportunity to
fight for Him It would be like deserting Him on the eve of a great
battle

She looked into his eager hopeful eyes Yes it had always been soit
always would be to the end Not priests and prophets but ever that
little scattered band of glad sufferers for His sake would be His army
His weapon still the cross till the victory should be won

She glanced through the open door to where the poor broken fellows she
always thought of as her boys lay so patient and then held out her
hand to him with a smile though the tears were in her eyes

So youre like all the rest of them lad she said Its for King and
country Good luck to you

After the war was over and the men released from their long terms of
solitary confinement came back to life injured in mind and body she was
almost glad he had escaped But at the time it filled her soul with
darkness

It was one noonday He had been down to the tribunal and his case had
been again adjourned She was returning from a lecture and crossing a
street in the neighbourhood of the docks found herself suddenly faced by
an oncoming crowd It was yelping and snarling curiously suggestive of
a pack of hungry wolves A couple of young soldiers were standing back
against a wall

Better not go on nurse said one of them Its some poor devil of a
Conchy I expect Must have a damned sight more pluck than I should

It was the fear that had been haunting her She did not know how white
she had turned

I think it is someone I know she said Wont you help me

The crowd gave way to them and they had all but reached him He was
hatless and bespattered but his tender eyes had neither fear nor anger
in them She reached out her arms and called to him Another step and
she would have been beside him but at the moment a slim laughing girl
darted in front of him and slipped her foot between his legs and he went
down

She heard the joyous yell and the shrill laughter as she struggled wildly
to force her way to him And then for a moment there was a space and a
man with bent body and clenched hands was rushing forward as if upon a
football field and there came a little sickening thud and then the crowd
closed in again

Her strength was gone and she could only wait More soldiers had come up
and were using their fists freely and gradually the crowd retired still
snarling and they lifted him up and brought him to her

Theres a chemists shop in the next street Wed better take him
there suggested the one who had first spoken to her And she thanked
them and followed them

They made a bed for him with their coats upon the floor and some of them
kept guard outside the shop while one putting aside the frightened
useless little chemist waited upon her bringing things needful while
she cleansed the foulness from his smooth young face and washed the
matted blood from his fair hair and closed the lids upon his tender
eyes and stooping kissed the cold quiet lips

There had been whispered talk among the men and when she rose the one
who had first spoken to her came forward He was nervous and stood
stiffly

Beg pardon nurse he said but weve sent for a stretcher as the
police dont seem in any hurry Would you like us to take him Or would
it upset him do you think if he knew

Thank you she answered He would think it kind of you I know

She had the feeling that he was being borne by comrades




CHAPTER XVII


It was from a small operating hospital in a village of the Argonne that
she first saw the war with her own eyes

Her father had wished her to go Arthurs death had stirred in him the
old Puritan blood with its record of long battle for liberty of
conscience If war claimed to be master of a mans soul then the new
warfare must be against war He remembered the saying of a Frenchwoman
who had been through the FrancoPrussian war Joan on her return from
Paris some years before had told him of her repeating her words But
of course it would not do to tell the truth the old lady had said or
we should have our children growing up to hate war

Ill be lonely and anxious till you come back he said But that will
have to be my part of the fight

She had written to Folk No female nurses were supposed to be allowed
within the battle zone but under pressure of shortage the French staff
were relaxing the rule and Folk had pledged himself to her discretion
I am not doing you any kindness he had written You will have to
share the common hardships and privations and the danger is real If I
didnt feel instinctively that underneath your mask of sweet
reasonableness you are one of the most obstinate young women God ever
made and that without me you would probably get yourself into a still
worse hole Id have refused And then followed a list of the things
she was to be sure to take with her including a pound or two of
Keatings insect powder and a hint that it might save her trouble if
she had her hair cut short

There was but one other woman at the hospital It had been a farmhouse
The man and both sons had been killed during the first year of the war
and the woman had asked to be allowed to stay on Her name was Madame
Lelanne She was useful by reason of her great physical strength She
could take up a man as he lay and carry him on her outstretched arms It
was an expressionless face with dull slowmoving eyes that never
changed She and Joan shared a small _grenier_ in one of the barns Joan
had brought with her a camp bedstead but the woman wrapping a blanket
round her would creep into a hole she had made for herself among the
hay She never took off her clothes except the great woodensoled
boots so far as Joan could discover

The medical staff consisted of a Dr Poujoulet and two assistants The
authorities were always promising to send him more help but it never
arrived One of the assistants a Monsieur Dubos a little man with a
remarkably big beard was a chemist who at the outbreak of the war had
been on the verge as he made sure of an important discovery in
connection with colour photography Almost the first question he asked
Joan was could she speak German Finding that she could he had hurried
her across the yard into a small hut where patients who had borne their
operation successfully awaited their turn to be moved down to one of the
convalescent hospitals at the base Among them was a German prisoner an
elderly man belonging to the Landwehr in private life a photographer
He also had been making experiments in the direction of colour
photography Chance had revealed to the two men their common interest
and they had been exchanging notes The German talked a little French
but not sufficient and on the day of Joans arrival they had reached an
impasse that was maddening to both of them Joan found herself up
against technical terms that rendered her task difficult but fortunately
had brought a dictionary with her and was able to make them understand
one another But she had to be firm with both of them allowing them
only ten minutes together at a time The little Frenchman would kneel by
the bedside holding the German at an angle where he could talk with
least danger to his wound It seemed that each was the very man the
other had been waiting all his life to meet They shed tears on one
anothers neck when they parted making all arrangements to write to one
another

And you will come and stay with me persisted the little Frenchman
when this affair is finishedhe made an impatient gesture with his
hands My wife takes much interest She will be delighted

And the big German again embracing the little Frenchman had promised
and had sent his compliments to Madame

The other was a young priest He wore the regulation Red Cross uniform
but kept his cassock hanging on a peg behind his bed He had pretty
frequent occasion to take it down These small emergency hospitals
within range of the guns were reserved for only dangerous cases men
whose wounds would not permit of their being carried further and there
never was much more than a sporting chance of saving them They were
always glad to find there was a priest among the staff Often it was the
first question they would ask on being lifted out of the ambulance Even
those who professed to no religion seemed comforted by the idea He went
by the title of Monsieur le Pretre Joan never learned his name It
was he who had laid out the little cemetery on the opposite side of the
village street It had once been an orchard and some of the trees were
still standing In the centre rising out of a pile of rockwork he had
placed a crucifix that had been found upon the roadside and had
surrounded it with flowers It formed the one bright spot of colour in
the village and at night time when all other sounds were hushed the
iron wreaths upon its little crosses swaying against one another in the
wind would make a low clear tinkling music Joan would sometimes lie
awake listening to it In some way she could not explain it always
brought the thought of children to her mind

The doctor himself was a broadshouldered bulletheaded man clean
shaven with closecropped bristly hair He had curiously square hands
with short squat fingers He had been head surgeon in one of the Paris
hospitals and had been assigned his present post because of his
marvellous quickness with the knife The hospital was the nearest to a
hill of great strategical importance and the fighting in the
neighbourhood was almost continuous Often a single ambulance would
bring in three or four cases each one demanding instant attention Dr
Poujoulet with his hairy arms bare to the shoulder would polish them
off one after another with hardly a moments rest between not allowing
time even for the washing of the table Joan would have to summon all
her nerve to keep herself from collapsing At times the need for haste
was such that it was impossible to wait for the anaesthetic to take
effect The one redeeming feature was the extraordinary heroism of the
men though occasionally there was nothing for it but to call in the
orderlies to hold some poor fellow down and to deafen ones ears

One day after a successful operation she was tending a young sergeant
He was a wellbuilt handsome man with skin as white as a womans He
watched her with curious indifference in his eyes as she busied herself
trying to make him comfortable and did nothing to help her

Has Mamselle ever seen a bull fight he asked her

No she answered Ive seen all the horror and cruelty I want to for
the rest of my life

Ah he said you would understand if you had When one of the horses
goes down gored his entrails lying out upon the sand you know what they
do dont you They put a rope round him and drag him groaning into
the shambles behind And once there kind people like you and Monsieur
le Medecin tend him and wash him and put his entrails back and sew him
up again He thinks it so kind of themthe first time But the second
He understands He will be sent back into the arena to be ripped up
again and again after that This is the third time I have been wounded
and as soon as youve all patched me up and Ive got my breath again
theyll send me back into it Mamselle will forgive my not feeling
grateful to her He gave a short laugh that brought the blood into his
mouth

The village consisted of one long straggling street following the course
of a small stream between two lines of hills It was on one of the great
lines of communication and troops and war material passed through it
going and coming in almost endless procession It served also as a camp
of rest Companies from the trenches would arrive there generally
towards the evening weary listless dulleyed many of them staggering
like overdriven cattle beneath their mass of burdens They would fling
their accoutrements from them and stand in silent groups till the
sergeants and corporals returned to lead them to the barns and outhouses
that had been assigned to them the houses still habitable being mostly
reserved for the officers Like those of most French villages they were
drab plastercovered buildings without gardens but some of them were
covered with vines hiding their ugliness and the village as a whole
with its groups here and there of fine sycamore trees and its great
stone fountain in the centre was picturesque enough It had twice
changed hands and a part of it was in ruins From one or two of the
more solidly built houses merely the front had fallen leaving the rooms
just as they had always been the furniture in its accustomed place the
pictures on the walls They suggested dolls houses standing open One
wondered when the giant child would come along and close them up The
iron spire of the little church had been hit twice It stood above the
village twisted into the form of a note of interrogation In the
churchyard many of the graves had been ripped open Bones and skulls lay
scattered about among the shattered tombstones But save for a couple
of holes in the roof the body was still intact and every afternoon a
faint timidsounding bell called a few villagers and a sprinkling of
soldiers to Mass Most of the inhabitants had fled but the farmers and
shopkeepers had remained At intervals the German batteries searching
round with apparent aimlessness would drop a score or so of shells about
the neighbourhood but the peasant with an indifference that was almost
animal would still follow his oxdrawn plough the old bent crone
muttering curses still ply the hoe The proprietors of the tiny
_epiceries_ must have been rapidly making their fortunes considering the
prices that they charged the unfortunate _poilu_ dreaming of some small
luxury out of his five sous a day But as one of them a stout smiling
lady explained to Joan with a gesture It is not often that one has a
war

Joan had gone out in September and for a while the weather was pleasant
The men wrapped up in their greatcoats would sleep for preference
under the great sycamore trees Through open doorways she would catch
glimpses of picturesque groups of eager cardplayers crowded round a
flickering candle From the darkness there would steal the sound of
flute or zither of voices singing Occasionally it would be some
strident ditty of the Paris musichalls but more often it was sad and
plaintive But early in October the rains commenced and the stream
became a roaring torrent and a clammy mist lay like a white river
between the wooded hills

Mud that seemed to be the one word with which to describe modern war
Mud everywhere Mud ankledeep upon the roads mud into which you sank
up to your knees the moment you stepped off it tents and huts to which
you waded through the mud avoiding the slimy gangways on which you
slipped and fell mudbespattered men mudbespattered horses little
donkeys looking as if they had been sculptured out of mud struggling up
and down the light railways that every now and then would disappear and
be lost beneath the mud guns and wagons groaning through the mud
lorries and ambulances that in the darkness had swerved from the
straight course overturned and lying abandoned in the mud
motorcyclists ploughing swift furrows through the mud rolling it back
in liquid streams each side of them staff cars rushing screaming through
the mud followed by a rushing fountain of mud serried ranks of muddy
men stamping through the mud with steady rhythm moving through a rain of
mud rising upward from the ground long lines of motorbuses filled with
a mass of muddy humanity packed shoulder to shoulder rumbling ever
through the endless mud

Men sitting by the roadside in the mud gnawing at unsavoury food men
squatting by the ditches examining their sores washing their bleeding
feet in the muddy water replacing the muddy rags about their wounds

A world without colour No other colour to be seen beneath the sky but
mud The very buttons on the mens coats painted to make them look like
mud

Mud and dirt Dirty faces dirty hands dirty clothes dirty food dirty
beds dirty interiors from which there was never time to wash the mud
dirty linen hanging up to dry beneath which dirty children played while
dirty women scolded Filth and desolation all around Shattered
farmsteads half buried in the mud shattered gardens trampled into mud A
weary land of foulness breeding foulness tangled wire the only harvest
of the fields mile after mile of gaping holes filled with muddy water
stinking carcases of dead horses birds of prey clinging to broken
fences flapping their great wings

A land where man died and vermin increased and multiplied Vermin on
your body vermin in your head vermin in your food vermin waiting for
you in your bed vermin the only thing that throve the only thing that
looked at you with bright eyes vermin the only thing to which the joy of
life had still been left

Joan had found a liking gradually growing up in her for the quickmoving
curttongued doctor She had dismissed him at first as a mere butcher
his brutal haste his indifference apparently to the suffering he was
causing his great strong hairy hands with their squat fingers his
cold grey eyes But she learnt as time went by that his callousness was
a thing that he put on at the same time that he tied his white apron
round his waist and rolled up his sleeves

She was resting after a morning of grim work on a bench outside the
hospital struggling with clenched quivering hands against a craving to
fling herself upon the ground and sob And he had found her there and
had sat down beside her

So you wanted to see it with your own eyes he said He laid his hand
upon her shoulder and she had some difficulty in not catching hold of
him and clinging to him She was feeling absurdly womanish just at that
moment

Yes she answered And Im glad that I did it she added defiantly

So am I he said Tell your children what you have seen Tell other
women

Its you women that make war he continued Oh I dont mean that you
do it on purpose but its in your blood It comes from the days when to
live it was needful to kill When a man who was swift and strong to kill
was the only thing that could save a woman and her brood Every other
man that crept towards them through the grass was an enemy and her only
hope was that her man might kill him while she watched and waited And
later came the tribe and instead of the one man creeping through the
grass the everlasting warfare was against all other tribes So you
loved only the men ever ready and willing to fight lest you and your
children should be carried into slavery then it was the only way You
brought up your boys to be fighters You told them stories of their
gallant sires You sang to them the songs of battle the glory of
killing and of conquering You have never unlearnt the lesson Man has
learnt comradeshipwould have travelled further but for you But woman
is still primitive She would still have her man the hater and the
killer To the woman the world has never changed

Tell the other women he said Open their eyes Tell them of their
sons that you have seen dead and dying in the foolish quarrel for which
there was no need Tell them of the foulness of the cruelty of the
senselessness of it all Set the women against War That is the only
way to end it

It was a morning or two later that knocking at the door of her loft he
asked her if she would care to come with him to the trenches He had
brought an outfit for her which he handed to her with a grin She had
followed Folks advice and had cut her hair and when she appeared before
him for inspection in trousers and overcoat the collar turned up about
her neck and reaching to her helmet he had laughingly pronounced the
experiment safe

A motor carried them to where the road ended and from there a little
onehorse ambulance took them on to almost the last trees of the forest
There was no life to be seen anywhere During the last mile they had
passed through a continuous double line of graves here and there a group
of tiny crosses keeping one another company others standing singly
looking strangely lonesome amid the tornup earth and shattered trees
But even these had ceased Death itself seemed to have been frightened
away from this terrorhaunted desert

Looking down she could see thin wreaths of smoke rising from the
ground From underneath her feet there came a low faint ceaseless
murmur

Quick said the doctor He pushed her in front of him and she almost
fell down a flight of mudcovered steps that led into the earth She
found herself in a long low gallery lighted by a dim oil lamp
suspended from the blackened roof A shelf ran along one side of it
covered with straw Three men lay there The straw was soaked with
their blood They had been brought in the night before by the stretcher
bearers A young surgeon was rearranging their splints and bandages and
redressing their wounds They would lie there for another hour or so
and then start for their twenty kilometre drive over shellridden roads
to one or another of the great hospitals at the base While she was
there two more cases were brought in The doctor gave but a glance at
the first one and then made a sign and the bearers passed on with him to
the further end of the gallery He seemed to understand for he gave a
low despairing cry and the tears sprang to his eyes He was but a boy
The other had a foot torn off One of the orderlies gave him two round
pieces of wood to hold in his hands while the young surgeon cut away the
hanging flesh and bound up the stump

The doctor had been whispering to one of the bearers He had the face of
an old man but his shoulders were broad and he looked sturdy He
nodded and beckoned Joan to follow him up the slippery steps

It is breakfast time he explained as they emerged into the air We
leave each other alone for half an houreven the snipers But we must
be careful She followed in his footsteps stooping so low that her
hands could have touched the ground They had to be sure that they did
not step off the narrow track marked with white stones lest they should
be drowned in the mud They passed the head of a dead horse It looked
as if it had been cut off and laid there the body was below it in the
mud

They spoke in whispers and Joan at first had made an effort to disguise
her voice But her conductor had smiled They shall be called the
brothers and the sisters of the Lord he had said Mademoiselle is
brave for her Brothers sake He was a priest There were many priests
among the stretcherbearers

Crouching close to the ground behind the spreading roots of a giant oak
she raised her eyes Before her lay a sea of smooth soft mud nearly a
mile wide From the centre rose a solitary tree from which all had been
shot away but two bare branches like outstretched arms above the silence
Beyond the hills rose again There was something unearthly in the
silence that seemed to brood above that sea of mud The old priest told
her of the living men French and German who had stood there day and
night sunk in it up to their waists screaming hour after hour and
waving their arms sinking into it lower and lower none able to help
them until at last only their screaming heads were left and after a
time these too would disappear and the silence come again

She saw the ditches like long graves dug for the living where the
weary listless men stood kneedeep in mud hoping for wounds that would
relieve them from the ghastly monotony of their existence the holes of
muddy water where the dead things lay to which they crept out in the
night to wash a little of the filth from their clammy bodies and their
stinking clothes the holes dug out of the mud in which they ate and
slept and lived year after year till brain and heart and soul seemed to
have died out of them and they remembered with an effort that they once
were men

    

After a time the care of the convalescents passed almost entirely into
Joans hands Madame Lelanne being told off to assist her By dint of
much persistence she had succeeded in getting the leaky roof repaired
and in place of the smoky stove that had long been her despair she had
one night procured a fine calorifere by the simple process of stealing
it Madame Lelanne had heard about it from the gossips It had been
brought to a lonely house at the end of the village by a major of
engineers He had returned to the trenches the day before and the place
for the time being was empty The thieves were never discovered The
sentry was positive that no one had passed him but two women one of them
carrying a baby Madame Lelanne had dressed it up in a childs cloak and
hood and had carried it in her arms As it must have weighed nearly a
couple of hundredweight suspicion had not attached to them

Space did not allow of any separation broken Frenchmen and broken
Germans would often lie side by side Joan would wonder with a grim
smile to herself what the patriotic Press of the different countries
would have thought had they been there to have overheard the
conversations Neither France nor Germany appeared to be the enemy but
a thing called They a mysterious power that worked its will upon them
both from a place they always spoke of as Back there One day the talk
fell on courage A young French soldier was holding forth when Joan
entered the hut

It makes me laugh he was saying all this newspaper talk Every
nation properly led fights bravely It is the male instinct Women go
into hysterics about it because it has not been given them I have the
Croix de Guerre with all three leaves and I havent half the courage of
my dog who weighs twelve kilos and would face a regiment by himself
Why a game cock has got more than the best of us Its the man who
doesnt think who cant think who has the most couragewho imagines
nothing but just goes forward with his head down like a bull There
is of course a real courage When you are by yourself and have to do
something in cold blood But the courage required for rushing forward
shouting and yelling with a lot of other fellowswhy it would take a
hundred times more pluck to turn back

They know that chimed in the man lying next to him or they would not
drug us Why when we stormed La Haye I knew nothing until an
uglylooking German spat a pint of blood into my face and woke me up

A middleaged sergeant who had a wound in the stomach and was sitting up
in his bed looked across There was a line of Germans came upon us
he said at Bras I thought I must be suffering from a nightmare when I
saw them They had thrown away their rifles and had all joined hands
They came dancing towards us just like a row of ballet girls They were
shrieking and laughing and they never attempted to do anything We just
waited until they were close up and then shot them down It was like
killing a lot of kids who had come to have a game with us The one I
potted got his arms round me before he coughed himself out calling me
his liebe Elsa and wanting to kiss me Lord You can guess how the
Boche inkslingers spread themselves over that business Sonderbar
Colossal Unvergessliche Helden Poor devils

Theyll give us ginger before it is over said another He had had
both his lips torn away and appeared to be always laughing Stuff it
into us as if we were horses at a fair That will make us run forward
right enough

Oh come struck in a youngster who was lying perfectly flat face
downwards on his bed it was the position in which he could breathe
easiest He raised his head a couple of inches and twisted it round so
as to get his mouth free It isnt as bad as all that Why the Thirty
third swarmed into Fort Malmaison of their own accord though twas like
jumping into a boiling furnace and held it for three days against pretty
nearly a division There werent a dozen of them left when we relieved
them They had no ammunition left Theyd just been filling up the gaps
with their bodies And they wouldnt go back even then We had to drag
them away They shant pass They shant passthats all they kept
saying His voice had sunk to a thin whisper

A young officer was lying in a corner behind a screen He leant forward
and pushed it aside

Oh give the devil his due you fellows he said War isnt a pretty
game but it does make for courage We all know that And things even
finer than mere fighting pluck There was a man in my company a Jacques
Decrusy He was just a stupid peasant lad We were crowded into one end
of the trench about a score of us The rest of it had fallen in and we
couldnt move And a bomb dropped into the middle of us and the same
instant that it touched the ground Decrusy threw himself flat down upon
it and took the whole of it into his body There was nothing left of him
but scraps But the rest of us got off Nobody had drugged him to do
that There isnt one of us who was in that trench that will not be a
better man to the end of his days remembering how Jacques Decrusy gave
his life for ours

Ill grant you all that sir answered the young soldier who had first
spoken He had long delicate hands and eager restless eyes War does
bring out heroism So does pestilence and famine Read Defoes account
of the Plague of London How men and women left their safe homes to
serve in the pesthouses knowing that sooner or later they were doomed
Read of the mothers in India who die of slow starvation never allowing a
morsel of food to pass their lips so that they may save up their own
small daily portion to add it to their childrens Why dont we pray to
God not to withhold from us His precious medicine of pestilence and
famine So is shipwreck a fine school for courage Look at the chance
it gives the captain to set a fine example And the engineers who stick
to their post with the water pouring in upon them We dont reconcile
ourselves to shipwrecks as a necessary school for sailors We do our
best to lessen them So did persecution bring out heroism It made
saints and martyrs Why have we done away with it If this game of
killing and being killed is the fine school for virtue it is made out to
be then all our efforts towards law and order have been a mistake We
never ought to have emerged from the jungle

He took a notebook from under his pillow and commenced to scribble

An oldlooking man spoke He lay with his arms folded across his breast
addressing apparently the smoky rafters He was a Russian a teacher of
languages in Paris at the outbreak of the war and had joined the French
Army

It is not only courage he said that War brings out It brings out
vile things too Oh Im not thinking merely of the Boches Thats the
cant of every nation that all the heroism is on one side and all the
brutality on the other Take men from anywhere and some of them will be
devils War gives them their opportunity brings out the beast Can you
wonder at it You teach a man to plunge a bayonet into the writhing
flesh of a fellow human being and twist it round and round and jamb it
further in while the blood is spurting from him like a fountain What
are you making of him but a beast A mans got to be a beast before he
can bring himself to do it I have seen things done by our own men in
cold blood the horror of which will haunt my memory until I die But of
course we hush it up when it happens to be our own people

He ceased speaking No one seemed inclined to break the silence

They remained confused in her memory these talks among the wounded men
in the low dimly lighted hut that had become her world At times it was
but two men speaking to one another in whispers at others every creaking
bed would be drawn into the argument

One topic that never lost its interest was Who made wars Who hounded
the people into them and kept them there tearing at one anothers
throats They never settled it

God knows I didnt want it speaking personally said a German prisoner
one day with a laugh I had been working at a printing business
sixteen hours a day for seven years It was just beginning to pay me
and now my wife writes me that she has had to shut the place up and sell
the machinery to keep them all from starving

But couldnt you have done anything to stop it demanded a Frenchman
lying next to him All your millions of Socialists what were they up
to What went wrong with the Internationale the Universal Brotherhood
of Labour and all that Tralala

The German laughed again Oh they know their business he answered
You have your glass of beer and go to bed and when you wake up in the
morning you find that war has been declared and you keep your mouth
shutunless you want to be shot for a traitor Not that it would have
made much difference he added I admit that The ground had been too
well prepared England was envious of our trade King Edward had been
plotting our destruction Our papers were full of translations from
yours talking about _La Revanche_ We were told that you had been
lending money to Russia to enable her to build railways and that when
they were complete France and Russia would fall upon us suddenly The
Fatherland in danger It may be lies or it may not what is one to do
What would you have doneeven if you could have done anything

Hes right said a dreamyeyed looking man laying down the book he had
been reading We should have done just the same My country right or
wrong After all it is an ideal

A dark blackbearded man raised himself painfully upon his elbow He
was a tailor in the Rue Parnesse and prided himself on a decided
resemblance to Victor Hugo

Its a noble ideal he said _La Patrie_ The great Mother Right
or wrong who shall dare to harm her Yes if it was she who rose up in
her majesty and called to us He laughed What does it mean in
reality Germania Italia La France Britannia Half a score of pompous
old muddlers with their fat wives egging them on sons of the fools
before them talkers who have wormed themselves into power by making
frothy speeches and fine promises My Country he laughed again Look
at them Cant you see their swelling paunches and their flabby faces
Half a score of ambitious politicians gouty old financiers baldheaded
old toffs with their waxed moustaches and false teeth Thats what we
mean when we talk about My Country a pack of selfish soulless muddle
headed old men And whether theyre right or whether theyre wrong our
duty is to fight at their biddingto bleed for them to die for them
that they may grow more sleek and prosperous He sank back on his
pillow with another laugh

Sometimes they agreed it was the newspapers that made warthat fanned
every trivial difference into a vital question of national honourthat
whenever there was any fear of peace restoked the fires of hatred with
their neverfailing stories of atrocities At other times they decided
it was the capitalists the traders scenting profit for themselves Some
held it was the politicians dreaming of going down to history as
Richelieus or as Bismarcks A popular theory was that cause for war was
always discovered by the ruling classes whenever there seemed danger that
the workers were getting out of hand In war you put the common people
back in their place revived in them the habits of submission and
obedience Napoleon the Little it was argued had started the war of
1870 with that idea Russia had welcomed the present war as an answer to
the Revolution that was threatening Czardom Others contended it was the
great munition industries aided by the military party the officers
impatient for opportunities of advancement the strategists eager to put
their theories to the test A few of the more philosophical shrugged
their shoulders It was the thing itself that sooner or later was bound
to go off of its own accord Half every countrys energy half every
countrys time and money was spent in piling up explosives In every
country envy and hatred of every other country was preached as a
religion They called it patriotism Sooner or later the spark fell

A wizened little man had been listening to it all one day He had a
curiously ratlike face with round red twinkling eyes and a long
pointed nose that twitched as he talked

Ill tell you who makes all the wars he said Its you and me my
dears we make the wars We love them Thats why we open our mouths
and swallow all the twaddle that the papers give us and cheer the fine
blackcoated gentlemen when they tell us its our sacred duty to kill
Germans or Italians or Russians or anybody else We are just crazy to
kill something it doesnt matter what If its to be Germans we shout
_A Berlin_ and if its to be Russians we cheer for Liberty I was in
Paris at the time of the Fashoda trouble How we hissed the English in
the cafes And how they glared back at us They were just as eager to
kill us Who makes a dog fight Why the dog Anybody can do it Who
could make us fight each other if we didnt want to Not all the kings
horses and all the Kings men No my dears its we make the wars You
and me my dears

There came a day in early spring All night long the guns had never
ceased It sounded like the tireless barking of ten thousand giant dogs
Behind the hills the whole horizon like a fiery circle was ringed with
flashing light Shapeless forms bent beneath burdens passed in endless
procession through the village Masses of rushing men swept like shadowy
phantoms through the fitfullyillumined darkness Beneath that
everlasting barking Joan would hear now the piercing wail of a child
now a clap of thunder that for the moment would drown all other sounds
followed by a faint low rumbling crash like the shooting of coals into
a cellar The wounded on their beds lay with wideopen terrified eyes
moving feverishly from side to side

At dawn the order came that the hospital was to be evacuated The
ambulances were already waiting in the street Joan flew up the ladder
to her loft the other side of the yard Madame Lelanne was already
there She had thrown a few things into a bundle and her foot was again
upon the ladder when it seemed to her that someone struck her hurling
her back upon the floor and the house the other side of the yard rose up
into the air and then fell quite slowly and a cloud of dust hid it from
her sight

Madame Lelanne must have carried her down the ladder She was standing
in the yard and the dust was choking her Across the street beyond the
ruins of the hospital swarms of men were running about like ants when
their nest has been disturbed Some were running this way and some
that And then they would turn and run back again making dancing
movements round one another and jostling one another The guns had
ceased and instead it sounded as if all the babies in the world were
playing with their rattles Suddenly Madame Lelanne reappeared out of
the dust and seizing Joan dragged her through a dark opening and down a
flight of steps and then left her She was in a great vaulted cellar A
faint light crept in through a grated window at the other end There was
a long table against the wall and in front of it a bench She staggered
to it and sat down leaning against the damp wall The place was very
silent Suddenly she began to laugh She tried to stop herself but
couldnt And then she heard footsteps descending and her memory came
back to her with a rush They were German footsteps she felt sure by
the sound they were so slow and heavy They should not find her in
hysterics anyhow She fixed her teeth into the wooden table in front of
her and held on to it with clenched hands She had recovered herself
before the footsteps had finished their descent With a relief that made
it difficult for her not to begin laughing again she found it was Madame
Lelanne and Monsieur Dubos They were carrying something between them
She hardly recognized Dubos at first His beard was gone and a line of
flaming scars had taken its place They laid their burden on the table
It was one of the wounded men from the hut They told her they were
bringing down two more The hut itself had not been hit but the roof
had been torn off by the force of the explosion and the others had been
killed by the falling beams Joan wanted to return with them but Madame
Lelanne had assumed an air of authority and told her she would be more
useful where she was From the top of the steps they threw down bundles
of straw on which they laid the wounded men and Joan tended them while
Madame Lelanne and the little chemist went up and down continuously
Before evening the place considering all things was fairly habitable
Madame Lelanne brought down the great stove from the hut and breaking a
pane of glass in the barred window they fixed it up with its chimney and
lighted it From time to time the turmoil above them would break out
again the rattling and sometimes a dull rumbling as of rushing water
But only a faint murmur of it penetrated into the cellar Towards night
it became quiet again

How long Joan remained there she was never quite sure There was little
difference between day and night After it had been quiet for an hour or
so Madame Lelanne would go out to return a little later with a wounded
man upon her back and when one died she would throw him across her
shoulder and disappear again up the steps Sometimes it was a Frenchman
and sometimes a German she brought in One gathered that the fight for
the village still continued There was but little they could do for them
beyond dressing their wounds and easing their pain Joan and the little
chemist took it in turns to relieve one another If Madame Lelanne ever
slept it was when she would sit in the shadow behind the stove her
hands upon her knees Dubos had been in the house when it had fallen
Madame Lelanne had discovered him pinned against a wall underneath a
great oak beam that had withstood the falling debris His beard had been
burnt off but otherwise he had been unharmed

She seemed to be living in a dream She could not shake from her the
feeling that it was not bodies but souls that she was tending The men
themselves gave colour to this fancy of hers Stripped of their poor
stained tattered uniforms they were neither French nor Germans Friend
or foe it was already but a memory Often awakening out of a sleep
they would look across at one another and smile as to a comrade A great
peace seemed to have entered there Faint murmurs as from some distant
troubled world would steal at times into the silence It brought a pang
of pity but it did not drive away the quiet that dwelt there

Once someone who must have known the place and had descended the steps
softly sat there among them and talked with them Joan could not
remember seeing him enter Perhaps unknowing she had fallen to sleep
for a few minutes Madame Lelanne was seated by the stove her great
coarse hands upon her knees her patient dull slowmoving eyes fixed
upon the speakers face Dubos was half standing half resting against
the table his arms folded upon his breast The wounded men had raised
themselves upon the straw and were listening Some leant upon their
elbows some sat with their hands clasped round their knees and one
with head bent down remained with his face hidden in his hands

The speaker sat a little way apart The light from the oil lamp
suspended from the ceiling fell upon his face He wore a peasants
blouse It seemed to her a face she knew Possibly she had passed him
in the village street and had looked at him without remembering It was
his eyes that for long years afterwards still haunted her She did not
notice at the time what language he was speaking But there were none
who did not understand him

You think of God as of a great King he said a Ruler who orders all
things who could change all things in the twinkling of an eye You see
the cruelty and the wrong around you And you say to yourselves He has
ordered it If He would He could have willed it differently So that
in your hearts you are angry with Him How could it be otherwise What
father loving his children would see them suffer wrong when by
stretching out a hand he could protect them turn their tears to
gladness What father would see his children doing evil to one another
and not check them would see them following ways leading to their
destruction and not pluck them back If God has ordered all things why
has He created evil making His creatures weak and sinful Does a father
lay snares for his children leading them into temptation delivering
them unto evil

There is no God apart from Man

God is a spirit His dwellingplace is in mans heart We are His
fellowlabourers It is through man that He shall one day rule the
world

God is knocking at your heart but you will not open to Him You have
filled your hearts with love of self There is no room for Him to enter
in

God whispers to you Be pitiful Be merciful Be just But you
answer Him If I am pitiful I lose my time and money If I am
merciful I forego advantage to myself If I am just I lessen my own
profit and another passes me in the race

And yet in your inmost thoughts you know that you are wrong that love
of self brings you no peace Who is happier than the lover thinking
only how to serve Who is the more joyous he who sits alone at the
table or he who shares his meal with a friend It is more blessed to
give than to receive How can you doubt it For what do you toil and
strive but that you may give to your children to your loved ones
reaping the harvest of their good

Who among you is the more honoured The miser or the giver he who
heaps up riches for himself or he who labours for others

Who is the true soldier He who has put away self His own ease and
comfort even his own needs his own safety they are but as a feather in
the balance when weighed against his love for his comrades for his
country The true soldier is not afraid to love He gives his life for
his friend Do you jeer at him Do you say he is a fool for his pains
No it is his honour his glory

God is love Why are you afraid to let Him in Hate knocks also at
your door and to him you open wide Why are you afraid of love All
things are created by love Hate can but destroy Why choose you death
instead of life God pleads to you He is waiting for your help

And one answered him

We are but poor men he said What can we do Of what use are such
as we

The young man looked at him and smiled

You can ask that he said you a soldier Does the soldier say I
am of no use I am but a poor man of no account Who has need of such
as I God has need of all There is none that shall not help to win
the victory It is with his life the soldier serves Who were they
whose teaching moved the world more than it has ever yet been moved by
the teaching of the wisest They were men of little knowledge of but
little learning poor and lowly It was with their lives they taught

Cast out self and God shall enter in and you shall be One with God
For there is none so lowly that he may not become the Temple of God
there is none so great that he shall be greater than this

The speaker ceased There came a faint sound at which she turned her
head and when she looked again he was gone

The wounded men had heard it also Dubos had moved forward Madame
Lelanne had risen It came again the thin faint shrill of a distant
bugle Footsteps were descending the stairs French soldiers laughing
shouting were crowding round them




CHAPTER XVIII


Her father met her at Waterloo He had business in London and they
stayed on for a few days Reading between the lines of his later
letters she had felt that all was not well with him His old heart
trouble had come back and she noticed that he walked to meet her very
slowly It would be all right now that she had returned he explained
he had been worrying himself about her

Mrs Denton had died She had left Joan her library together with her
wonderful collection of note books She had brought them all uptodate
and indexed them They would be invaluable to Francis when he started
the new paper upon which they had determined He was still in the
hospital at Breganze near to where his machine had been shot down She
had tried to get to him but it would have meant endless delays and she
had been anxious about her father The Italian surgeons were very proud
of him he wrote They had had him Xrayed before and after and beyond
a slight lameness which gave him he thought a touch of distinction
there was no flaw that the most careful scrutiny would be likely to
detect Any day now he expected to be discharged Mary had married an
old sweetheart She had grown restless in the country with nothing to
do and at the suggestion of some friends had gone to Bristol to help
in a childrens hospital and there they had met once more

Neil Singleton after serving two years in a cholera hospital at Baghdad
had died of the flu in Dover twentyfours hours after landing Madge was
in Palestine She had been appointed secretary to a committee for the
establishment of native schools She expected to be there for some
years she wrote The work was interesting and appealed to her

Flossie phoned her from Paddington Station the second day and by luck
she happened to be in Flossie had just come up from Devonshire Sam
had got through and she was on her way to meet him at Hull She had
heard of Joans arrival in London from one of Carletons illustrated
dailies She brought the paper with her They had used the old
photograph that once had adorned each week the _Sunday Post_ Joan
hardly recognized herself in the serene selfconfident young woman who
seemed to be looking down upon a world at her feet The world was strong
and cruel she had discovered and Joans but small and weak One had to
pretend that one was not afraid of it

Flossie had joined every society she could hear of that was working for
the League of Nations Her hope was that it would get itself established
before young Frank grew up

Not that I really believe it will she confessed A draw might have
disgusted us all with fighting As it is half the world is dancing at
Victory balls exhibiting captured guns on every village green and
hanging fathers helmet above the mantelpiece while the other half is
nursing its revenge Young Frank only cares for life because he is
looking forward to one day driving a tank Ive made up my mind to burn
Sams uniform but I expect it will end in my wrapping it up in lavender
and hiding it away in a drawer And then there will be all the books and
plays No selfrespecting heroine for the next ten years will dream of
marrying anyone but a soldier

Joan laughed Difficult to get anything else just at present she
said Its the soldiers Im looking to for help I dont think the men
who have been there will want their sons to go Its the women Im
afraid of

Flossie caught sight of the clock and jumped up Who was it said that
woman would be the last thing man would civilize she asked

It sounds like Meredith suggested Joan I am not quite sure

Well hes wrong anyhow retorted Flossie Its no good our waiting
for man He is too much afraid of us to be of any real help to us We
shall have to do it ourselves She gave Joan a hug and was gone

Phillips was still abroad with the Army of Occupation He had tried to
get out of it but had not succeeded He held it to be gaolers work
and the sight of the starving populace was stirring in him a fierce
anger

He would not put up again for Parliament He was thinking of going back
to his old work upon the Union Parliament is played out he had
written her Kings and Aristocracies have served their purpose and have
gone and now the Ruling Classes as they call themselves must be
content to hear the bell toll for them also Parliament was never
anything more than an instrument in their hands and never can be What
happens Once in every five years you wake the people up tell them the
time has come for them to exercise their Heavenordained privilege of
putting a cross against the names of some seven hundred gentlemen who
have kindly expressed their willingness to rule over them After that
you send the people back to sleep and for the next five years these
seven hundred gentlemen consulting no one but themselves rule over the
country as absolutely as ever a Caesar ruled over Rome What sort of
Democracy is that Even a Labour Governmentsupposing that in spite of
the Press it did win throughwhat would be its fate Separated from its
base imprisoned within those traditionhaunted walls it would lose
touch with the people would become in its turn a mere oligarchy If the
people are ever to govern they must keep their hand firmly upon the
machine not remain content with pulling a lever and then being shown the
door

She had sent a note by messenger to Mary Stopperton to say she was
coming Mary had looked very fragile the last time she had seen her
just before leaving for France and she had felt a fear Mary had
answered in her neat thin quavering writing asking her to come early
in the morning Sometimes she was a little tired and had to lie down
again She had been waiting for Joan She had a present for her

The morning promised to be fair and she decided to walk by way of the
Embankment The great river with its deep strong patience had always
been a friend to her It was Sunday and the city was still sleeping The
pale December sun rose above the mist as she reached the corner of
Westminster Bridge turning the river into silver and flooding the silent
streets with a soft white tender light

The tower of Chelsea Church brought back to her remembrance of the wheezy
old clergyman who had preached there that Sunday evening that now seemed
so long ago when her footsteps had first taken her that way by chance
Always she had intended making inquiries and discovering his name Why
had she never done so It would surely have been easy He was someone
she had known as a child She had become quite convinced of that She
could see his face close to hers as if he had lifted her up in his arms
and was smiling at her But pride and power had looked out of his eyes
then

It was earlier than the time she had fixed in her own mind and pausing
with her elbows resting on the granite parapet she watched the ceaseless
waters returning to the sea bearing their burden of impurities

All roads lead to Calvary It was curious how the words had dwelt with
her till gradually they had become a part of her creed She remembered
how at first they had seemed to her a threat chilling her with fear They
had grown to be a promise a hope held out to all The road to Calvary
It was the road to life By the giving up of self we gained God

And suddenly a great peace came to her One was not alone in the fight
God was with us the great Comrade The evil and the cruelty all round
her she was no longer afraid of it God was coming Beyond the menace
of the passing day black with the wars foul aftermath of evil dreams
and hatreds she saw the breaking of the distant dawn The devil should
not always triumph God was gathering His labourers

God was conquering Unceasing through the ages Gods voice had crept
round man seeking entry Through the long darkness of that dim
beginning when man knew no law but self unceasing God had striven
until at last one here and there emerging from the brute had heardhad
listened to the voice of love and pity and in that hour unknowing had
built to God a temple in the wilderness

Labourers together with God The mighty host of those who through the
ages had heard the voice of God and had made answer The men and women
in all lands who had made room in their hearts for God Still nameless
scattered unknown to one another still powerless as yet against the
worlds foul law of hate they should continue to increase and multiply
until one day they should speak with Gods voice and should be heard And
a new world should be created

God The tireless Spirit of eternal creation the Spirit of Love What
else was it that out of formlessness had shaped the spheres had planned
the orbits of the suns The law of gravity we named it What was it but
another name for Love the yearning of like for like the calling to one
another of the stars What else but Love had made the worlds had
gathered together the waters had fashioned the dry land The cohesion
of elements so we explained it The clinging of like to like The
brotherhood of the atoms

God The Eternal Creator Out of matter lifeless void he had moulded
His worlds had ordered His endless firmament It was finished The
greater task remained the Universe of mind of soul Out of man it
should be created God in man and man in God made in like image fellow
labourers together with one another together they should build it Out
of the senseless strife and discord above the chaos and the tumult
should be heard the new command Let there be Love

The striking of the old church clock recalled her to herself But she
had only a few minutes walk before her Mary had given up her Church
work It included the cleaning and she had found it beyond her failing
strength But she still lived in the tiny cottage behind its long strip
of garden The door yielded to Joans touch it was seldom fast closed
And knowing Marys ways she entered without knocking and pushed it to
behind her leaving it still ajar

And as she did so it seemed to her that someone passing breathed upon
her lips a little kiss and for a while she did not move Then treading
softly she looked into the room

It welcomed her as always with its smile of cosy neatness The
spotless curtains that were Marys pride the gay flowers in the window
to which she had given childrens names the few poor pieces of
furniture polished with much loving labour the shining grate the
foolish china dogs and the little china house between them on the
mantelpiece The fire was burning brightly and the kettle was singing
on the hob

Marys work was finished She sat upright in her straightbacked chair
before the table her eyes half closed It seemed so odd to see those
little workworn hands idle upon her lap

Joans present lay on the table near to her as if she had just folded it
and placed it there the little cap and the fine robe of lawn as if for
a kings child

Joan had never thought that Death could be so beautiful It was as if
some friend had looked in at the door and seeing her so tired had
taken the work gently from her hands and had folded them upon her lap
And she had yielded with a smile

Joan heard a faint rustle and looked up A woman had entered It was
the girl she had met there on a Christmas Day a Miss Ensor Joan had
met her once or twice since then She was still in the chorus Neither
of them spoke for a few minutes

I have been expecting every morning to find her gone said the girl I
think she only waited to finish this She gently unfolded the fine lawn
robe and they saw the delicate insertion and the wonderful embroidery

I asked her once said the girl why she wasted so much work on them
They were mostly only for poor people One never knows dearie she
answered with that childish smile of hers It may be for a little
Christ

They would not let less loving hands come near her

    

Her father had completed his business and both were glad to leave
London She had a sense of something sinister foreboding casting its
shadow on the sordid unclean streets the neglected buildings falling
into disrepair A lurking savagery a halfveiled enmity seemed to be
stealing among the people The towns mad lust for pleasure its fierce
unjoyous laughter its desire ever to be in crowds as if afraid of
itself its orgies of eating and drinking its animallike indifference
to the misery and death that lay but a little way beyond its own horizon
She dared not remember history Perhaps it would pass

The long slow journey tried her fathers strength and assuming an
authority to which he yielded obedience tempered by grumbling Joan sent
him to bed and would not let him come down till Christmas Day The big
square house was on the outskirts of the town where it was quiet and in
the afternoon they walked in the garden sheltered behind its high brick
wall

He told her of what had been done at the works Arthurs plan had
succeeded It might not be the last word but at least it was on the
road to the right end The men had been brought into it and shared the
management And the disasters predicted had proved groundless

You wont be able to indulge in all your mad schemes he laughed but
therell be enough to help on a few And you will be among friends
Arthur told me he had explained it to you and that you had agreed

Yes she answered It was the last time he came to see me in London
And I could not help feeling a bit jealous He was doing things while I
was writing and talking But I was glad he was an Allway It will be
known as the Allway scheme New ways will date from it

She had thought it time for him to return indoors but he pleaded for a
visit to his beloved roses He prided himself on being always able to
pick roses on Christmas Day

This young man of yours he asked what is he like

Oh just a Christian gentleman she answered You will love him when
you know him

He laughed And this new journal of his he asked Its got to be
published in London hasnt it

She gave a slight start for in their letters to one another they had
been discussing this very point

No she answered it could be circulated just as well from say
Birmingham or Manchester

He was choosing his roses They held their petals wrapped tight round
them trying to keep the cold from their brave hearts In the warmth
they would open out and be gay until the end

Not Liverpool he suggested

Or even Liverpool she laughed

They looked at one another and then beyond the sheltering evergreens and
the wide lawns to where the great square house seemed to be listening

Its an ugly old thing he said

No it isnt she contradicted Its simple and big and kind I
always used to feel it disapproved of me I believe it has come to love
me in its solemn old brick way

It was built by Kent in seventeenforty for your greatgreat
grandfather he explained He was regarding it more affectionately
Solid respectability was the dream then

I think thats why I love it she said for its dear oldfashioned
ways We will teach it the new dreams too It will be so shocked at
first

They dined in state in the great diningroom

I was going to buy you a present he grumbled But you wouldnt let
me get up

I want to give you something quite expensive Dad she said Ive had
my eye on it for years

She slipped her hand in his I want you to give me that Dream of yours
that you built for my mother and that all went wrong They call it
Allways Folly and it makes me so mad I want to make it all come true
May I try

    

It was there that he came to her

She stood beneath the withered trees beside the shattered fountain The
sadfaced ghosts peeped out at her from the broken windows of the little
silent houses

She wondered later why she had not been surprised to see him But at the
time it seemed to be in the order of things that she should look up and
find him there

She went to him with outstretched arms

Im so glad youve come she said I was just wanting you

They sat on the stone step of the fountain where they were sheltered
from the wind and she buttoned his long coat about him

Do you think you will go on doing it he asked with a laugh

Im so afraid she answered gravely That I shall come to love you
too much the home the children and you I shall have none left over

There is an old Hindoo proverb he said That when a man and woman
love they dig a fountain down to God

This poor little chokedup thing he said against which we are
sitting its for want of men and women drawing water of children
dabbling their hands in it and making themselves all wet that it has run
dry

She took his hands in hers to keep them warm The nursing habit seemed
to have taken root in her

I see your argument she said The more I love you the deeper will
be the fountain So that the more Love I want to come to me the more I
must love you

Dont you see it for yourself he demanded

She broke into a little laugh

Perhaps you are right she admitted Perhaps that is why He made us
male and female to teach us to love

A robin broke into a song of triumph He had seen the sadfaced ghosts
steal silently away

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergnetfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
