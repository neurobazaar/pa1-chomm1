Chapter I AT LEAST I MEANT WELL

When the dreadful thing occurred that night every one turned on me
The injustice of it hurt me most They said I got up the dinner that
I asked them to give up other engagements and come that I promised all
kinds of jollification if they would come and then when they did come
and got in the papers and every onebut ourselveslaughed himself
black in the face they turned on ME I who suffered ten times to their
one I shall never forget what Dallas Brown said to me standing with a
coal shovel in one hand and awell perhaps it would be better to tell
it all in the order it happened

It began with Jimmy Wilson and a conspiracy was helped on by a
footsquare piece of yellow paper and a Japanese butler and it
enmeshed and mixed up generally ten respectable members of society and
a policeman Incidentally it involved a pearl collar and a box of soap
which sounds incongruous doesnt it

It is a great misfortune to be stout especially for a man Jim was
rotund and looked shorter than he really was and as all the lines of
his face or what should have been lines were really dimples his face
was about as flexible and full of expression as a pillow in a tight
cover The angrier he got the funnier he looked and when he was raging
and his neck swelled up over his collar and got red he was entrancing
And everybody liked him and borrowed money from him and laughed at his
pictures he has one in the Hargrave gallery in London now so people
buy them instead and smoked his cigarettes and tried to steal his
Jap The whole story hinges on the Jap

The trouble was I think that no one took Jim seriously His ambition
in life was to be taken seriously but people steadily refused to His
art was a huge jokeexcept to himself If he asked people to dinner
every one expected a frolic When he married Bella Knowles people
chuckled at the wedding and considered it the wildest prank of Jimmys
career although Jim himself seemed to take it awfully hard

We had all known them both for years I went to Farmington with Bella
and Anne Brown was her matron of honor when she married Jim My first
winter out Jimmy had paid me a lot of attention He painted my portrait
in oils and had a studio tea to exhibit it It was a very nice picture
but it did not look like me so I stayed away from the exhibition Jim
asked me to He said he was not a photographer and that anyhow the rest
of my features called for the nose he had given me and that all the
Greuze women have long necks I have not

After I had refused Jim twice he met Bella at a camp in the Adirondacks
and when he came back he came at once to see me He seemed to think I
would be sorry to lose him and he blundered over the telling for twenty
minutes Of course no woman likes to lose a lover no matter what she
may say about it but Jim had been getting on my nerves for some time
and I was much calmer than he expected me to be

If you mean I said finally in desperation that you and Bella
areare in love why dont you say so Jim I think you will find that
I stand it wonderfully

He brightened perceptibly

I didnt know how you would take it Kit he said and I hope we will
always be bully friends You are absolutely sure you dont care a whoop
for me

Absolutely I replied and we shook hands on it Then he began about
Bella it was very tiresome

Bella is a nice girl but I had roomed with her at school and I was
under no illusions When Jim raved about Bella and her banjo and Bella
and her guitar I had painful moments when I recalled Bella learning
her two songs on each instrument and the old English ballad she had
learned to play on the harp When he said she was too good for him I
never batted an eye And I shook hands solemnly across the teatable
again and wished him happinesswhich was sincere enough but
hopelessand said we had only been playing a game but that it was time
to stop playing Jim kissed my hand and it was really very touching

We had been the best of friends ever since Two days before the wedding
he came around from his tailors and we burned all his letters to me
He would read one and say Heres a crackerjack Kit and pass it
to me And after I had read it we would lay it on the firelog and Jim
would say I am not worthy of her Kit I wonder if I can make her
happy OrDid you know that the Duke of Belford proposed to her in
London last winter

Of course one has to take the womans word about a thing like that but
the Duke of Belford had been mad about Maude Richard all that winter

You can see that the burning of the letters which was meant to be
reminiscently sentimental a sort of howsillywewerebutitis
allovernow occasion became actually a two hours eulogy of Bella And
just when I was bored to death the Mercer girls dropped in and heard
Jim begin to read one commencing dearest Kit And the next day after
the rehearsal dinner they told Bella

There was very nearly no wedding at all Bella came to see me in a
frenzy the next morning and threw Jim and his twohundred odd pounds in
my face and although I explained it all over and over she never quite
forgave me That was what made it so hard laterthe situation would
have been bad enough without that complication

They went abroad on their wedding journey and stayed several months
And when Jim came back he was fatter than ever Everybody noticed it
Bella had a gymnasium fitted up in a corner of the studio but he would
not use it He smoked a pipe and painted all day and drank beer and
WOULD eat starches or whatever it is that is fattening But he adored
Bella and he was madly jealous of her At dinners he used to glare at
the man who took her in although it did not make him thin Bella was
flirting too and by the time they had been married a year people
hitched their chairs together and dropped their voices when they were
mentioned

Well on the anniversary of the day Bella left himoh yes she left him
finally She was intense enough about some things and she said it got
on her nerves to have everybody chuckle when they asked for her husband
They would say Hello Bella Hows Bubbles Still banting And Bella
would try to laugh and say He swears his tailor says his waist is
smaller but if it is he must be growing hollow in the back

But she got tired of it at last Well on the second anniversary of
Bellas departure Jimmy was feeling pretty glum and as I say I am
very fond of Jim The divorce had just gone through and Bella had taken
her maiden name again and had had an operation for appendicitis We
heard afterward that they didnt find an appendix and that the one they
showed her in a glass jar WAS NOT HERS But if Bella ever suspected she
didnt say Whether the appendix was anonymous or not she got box after
box of flowers that were and of course every one knew that it was Jim
who sent them

To go back to the anniversary I went to Rothbergs to see the
collection of antique furnituremother was looking for a sideboard
for fathers birthday in Marchand I met Jimmy there boring into a
wormhole in a seventeenthcentury bedpost with the end of a match and
looking his nearest to sad When he saw me he came over

Im blue today Kit he said after we had shaken hands Come and
help me dig bait and then lets go fishing If theres a worm in every
hole in that bedpost we could go into the fish business Its a good
business

Better than painting I asked But he ignored my gibe and swelled up
alarmingly in order to sigh

This is the worst day of the year for me he affirmed staring
straight ahead and the longest Look at that crazy clock over there
If you want to see your life passing away if you want to see the steps
by which you are marching to eternity watch that clock marking the
time Look at that infernal hand staying quiet for sixty seconds and
then jumping forward to catch up with the procession Ugh

See here Jim I said leaning forward youre not well You cant go
through the rest of the day like this I know what youll do youll
go home to play Grieg on the pianola and you wont eat any dinner He
looked guilty

Not Grieg he protested feebly Beethoven

Youre not going to do either I said with firmness You are going
right home to unpack those new draperies that Harry Bayles sent you from
Shanghai and you are going to order dinner for eightthat will be two
tables of bridge And you are not going to touch the pianola

He did not seem enthusiastic but he rose and picked up his hat and
stood looking down at me where I sat on an old horsehair covered sofa

I wish to thunder I had married you he said savagely Youre the
finest girl I know Kit WITHOUT EXCEPTION and you are going to throw
yourself away on Jack Manning or Max or some other

Nothing of the sort I said coldly and the fact that you didnt
marry me does not give you the privilege of abusing my friends Anyhow
I dont like you when you speak like that

Jim took me to the door and stopped there to sigh

I havent been well he said heavily Dont eat dont sleep
Wouldnt you think Id lose flesh Kithe lowered his voice
solemnlyI have gained two pounds

I said he didnt look it which appeared to comfort him somewhat and
because we were old friends I asked him where Bella was He said he
thought she was in Europe and that he had heard she was going to marry
Reggie Wolfe Then he signed again muttered something about ordering
the funeral baked meats to be prepared and left me

That was my entire share in the affair I was the victim both of
circumstances and of their plot which was mad on the face of it

During the entire time they never once let me forget that I got up the
dinner that I telephoned around for them They asked me why I couldnt
cookwhen not one of them knew one side of a range from the other And
for Anne Brown to talk the way she didsaying I had always been crazy
about Jim and that she believed I had known all along that his aunt was
comingfor Anne to talk like that was sheer idiocy Yes there was an
aunt The Japanese butler started the trouble and Aunt Selina carried
it along



Chapter II THE WAY IT BEGAN

It makes me angry every time I think how I tried to make that dinner a
success I canceled a theater engagement and I took the Mercer girls in
the electric brougham father had given me for Christmas Their chauffeur
had been gone for hours with their machine and they had telephoned all
the police stations without success They were afraid that there had
been an awful smash they could easily have replaced Bartlett as Lollie
said but it takes so long to get new parts for those foreign cars

Jim had a house well uptown and it stood just enough apart from
the other houses to be entirely maddening later It was a threestory
affair with a basement kitchen and servants dining room Then of
course there were cellars as we found out afterward On the first
floor there was a large square hall a formal reception room behind it
a big living room that was also a library then a den and back of all
a Georgian dining room with windows high above the ground On the
top floor Jim had a studio like every other one I ever sawperhaps a
little mussier Jim was really a grind at his painting and there
were cigarette ashes and palette knives and buffalo rugs and shields
everywhere It is strange but when I think of that terrible house I
always see the halls enormous covered with heavy rugs and stairs that
would have taken six housemaids to keep in proper condition I dream
about those stairs stretching above me in a Jacobs ladder of shining
wood and Persian carpets going up up clear to the roof

The Dallas Browns walked they lived in the next block And they brought
with them a man named Harbison that no one knew Anne said he would
be great sport because he was terribly serious and had the most
exaggerated ideas of society and loathed extravagance and built
bridges or something She had put away her cigarettes since he had been
with themhe and Dallas had been college friendsand the only chance
she had to smoke was when she was getting her hair done And she had
singed off quite a lota burnt offering she called it

My dear she said over the telephone when I invited her I want you
to know him Hell be crazy about you That type of man big and deadly
earnest always falls in love with your type of girl the appealing
sort you know And he has been too busy up to now to know what love
is But mind dont hurt him hes a dear boy Im half in love with him
myself and Dallas trots around at his heels like a poodle

But all Annes geese are swans so I thought little of the Harbison man
except to hope that he played respectable bridge and wouldnt mark the
cards with a steel spring under his finger nail as one of her finds
had done

We all arrived about the same time and Anne and I went upstairs
together to take off our wraps in what had been Bellas dressing room
It was Anne who noticed the violets

Look at that she nudged me when the maid was examining her wrap
before she laid it down What did I tell you Kit Hes still quite mad
about her

Jim had painted Bellas portrait while they were going up the Nile on
their wedding trip It looked quite like her if you stood well off in
the middle of the room and if the light came from the right And just
beneath it in a silver vase was a bunch of violets It was really
touching and violets were fabulous It made me want to cry and
to shake Bella soundly and to go down and pat Jim on his generous
shoulder and tell him what a good fellow I thought him and that
Bella wasnt worth the dust under his feet I dont know much about
psychology but it would be interesting to know just what effect those
violets and my sympathy for Jim had in influencing my decision a half
hour later It is not surprising under the circumstances that for some
time after the odor of violets made me ill

We all met downstairs in the living room quite informally and Dallas
was banging away at the pianola tramping the pedals with the delicacy
and feeling of a football center rush kicking a goal Mr Harbison was
standing near the fire a little away from the others and he was all
that Anne had said and more in appearance He was tallnot too tall
and very straight And after one got past the oddity of his face being
bronzecolored above his white collar and of his brown hair being
sunbleached on top until it was almost yellow one realized that he was
very handsome He had what one might call a resolute nose and chin and
a pleasant rather humorous mouth And he had blue eyes that were
at that moment wandering with interest over the lot of us Somebody
shouted his name to me above the Tristan and Isolde music and I held
out my hand

Instantly I had the feeling one sometimes has of having done just that
same thing with the same surroundings in the same place years before
I was looking up at him and he was staring down at me and holding my
hand And then the music stopped and he was saying

Where was it

Where was what I asked The feeling was stronger than ever with his
voice

I beg your pardon he said and let my hand drop Just for a second
I had an idea that we had met before somewhere a long time ago I
supposeno it couldnt have happened or I should remember He was
smiling half at himself

No I smiled back at him It didnt happen Im afraidunless we
dreamed it

We

I felt that way too for a moment

The Brushwood Boy he said with conviction Perhaps we will find a
common dream life where we knew each other You remember the Brushwood
Boy loved the girl for years before they really met But this was a
little too rapid even for me

Nothing so sentimental Im afraid I retorted I have had exactly
the same sensation sometimes when I have sneezed

Betty Mercer captured him then and took him off to see Jims newest
picture Anne pounced on me at once

Isnt he delicious she demanded Did you ever see such shoulders
And such a nose And he thinks we are parasites cumberers of the earth
Heaven knows what He says every woman ought to know how to earn her
living in case of necessity I said I could make enough at bridge and
he thought I was joking Hes a dear Anne was enthusiastic

I looked after him Oddly enough the feeling that we had met before
stuck to me Which was ridiculous of course for we learned afterward
that the nearest we ever came to meeting was that our mothers had been
school friends Just then I saw Jim beckoning to me crazily from the
den He looked quite yellow and he had been running his fingers through
his hair

For Heavens sake come in Kit he said I need a cool head Didnt
I tell you this is my calamity day

Cook gone I asked with interest I was starving

He closed the door and took up a tragic attitude in front of the fire
Did you ever hear of Aunt Selina he demanded

I knew there WAS one I ventured mindful of certain gossip as to
whence Jimmy derived the Wilson income

Jim himself was too worried to be cautious He waved a brazen hand at
the snug room at the Japanese prints on the walls at the rugs at the
teakwood cabinets and the screen inlaid with pearl and ivory

All this he said comprehensively every bite I eat clothes I wear
drinks I drinkyou neednt look like that I dont drink so darned
mucheverything comes from Aunt Selinabuttons he finished with a
groan

Selina Buttons I said reflectively I dont remember ever having
known any one named Buttons although I had a cat once

Damn the cat he said rudely Her name isnt Buttons Her name is
Caruthers my Aunt Selina Caruthers and the money comes from buttons

Oh feebly

Its an old business he went on with something of proprietary pride
My grandfather founded it in 1775 Made buttons for the Continental
Army

Oh yes I said They melted the buttons to make bullets didnt
they Or they melted bullets to make buttons Which was it

But again he interrupted

Its like this he went on hurriedly Aunt Selina believes in me She
likes pictures and she wanted me to paint if I could Id have given
up long agooh I know what you think of my workbut for Aunt Selina
She has encouraged me and shes done more than that shes paid the
bills

Dear Aunt Selina I breathed

When I got married Jim persisted Aunt Selina doubled my allowance
I always expected to sell something and begin to make money and in
the meantime what she advanced I considered as a loan He was eyeing me
defiantly but I was growing serious It was evident from the preamble
that something was coming

To understand Kit he went on dubiously you would have to know her
She wont stand for divorce She thinks it is a crime

What I sat up I have always regarded divorce as essentially
disagreeable like castor oil but necessary

Oh you know well enough what Im driving at he burst out savagely
She doesnt know Bella has gone She thinks I am living in a little
domestic heaven andshe is coming tonight to hear me flap my wings

Tonight

I dont think Jimmy had known that Dallas Brown had come in and was
listening I am sure I had not Hearing his chuckle at the doorway
brought us up with a jerk

Where has Aunt Selina been for the last two or three years he asked
easily

Jim turned and his face brightened

Europe Look here Dal youre a smart chap Shell only be here about
four hours Cant you think of some way to get me out of this I want to
let her down easy too Im mighty fond of Aunt Selina Cant wecant
I say Bella has a headache

Rotten laconically

Gone out of town Jim was desperate

And you with a houseful of dinner guests Try again Jim

I have it Jim said suddenly Dallas ask Anne if she wont play
hostess for tonight Be Mrs Wilson pro tem Anne would love it Aunt
Selina never saw Bella Then afterward next year when Im hung in
the Academy and can stand on my feetNot if youre hung Dallas
interjectedIll break the truth to her

But Dallas was not enthusiastic

Anne wouldnt do at all he declared Shed be talking about the
kids before she knew it and patting me on the head He said it
complacently Anne flirts but they are really devoted

One of the Mercer girls I suggested but Jimmy raised a horrified
hand

You dont know Aunt Selina he protested I couldnt offer Leila in
the gown shes got on unless she wore a shawl and Betty is too fair

Anne came in just then and the whole story had to be told again to her
She was ecstatic She said it was good enough for a play and that of
course she would be Mrs Jimmy for that length of time

You know she finished if it were not for Dal I would be Mrs Jimmy
for ANY length of time I have been devoted to you for years Billiken

But Dallas refused peremptorily

Im not jealous he explained straightening and throwing out his
chest butwell you dont look the part Anne Youreyou are
growing matronly not but what you suit ME all right And then Id
forget and call you mammy which would require explanation I think
its up to you Kit

I shall do nothing of the sort I snapped Its ridiculous

I dare you said Dallas

I refused I stood like a rock while the storm surged around me and beat
over me I must say for Jim that he was merely pathetic He said that my
happiness was first that he would not give me an uncomfortable minute
for anything on earth and that Bella had been perfectly right to
leave him because he was a sinking ship and deserved to be turned out
penniless into the world After which mixed figure he poured himself
something to drink and his hands were shaking

Dal and Anne stood on each side of him and patted him on the shoulders
and glared across at me I felt that if I was a rock Jims ship had
struck on me and was sinking as he said because of me I began to
crumble

Whatwhat time does she leave I asked wavering

Ten nine KIT are you going to do it

No I gave a last clutch at my resolution People who do that kind
of thing always get into trouble She might miss her train Shes almost
certain to miss her train

Youre temporizing Dallas said sternly We wont let her miss her
train you can be sure of that

Jim Anne broke in suddenly hasnt she a picture of Bella Theres
not the faintest resemblance between Bella and Kit

Jim became downcast again I sent her a miniature of Bella a couple of
years ago he said despondently Did it myself

But Dal said he remembered the miniature and it looked more like me
than Bella anyhow So we were just where we started And down inside of
me I had a premonition that I was going to do just what they wanted
me to do and get into all sorts of trouble and not be thanked for it
after all Which was entirely correct And then Leila Mercer came and
banged at the door and said that dinner had been announced ages ago and
that everybody was famishing With the hurry and stress and poor Jims
distracted face I weakened

I feel like a cross between an idiot and a criminal I said shortly
and I dont know particularly why every one thinks I should be the
victim for the sacrifice But if you will promise to get her off early
to her train and if you will stand by me and not leave me alone with
her II might try it

Of course well stand by you they said in chorus We wont let you
stick And Dal said Youre the right sort of girl Kit And after
its all over youll realize that its the biggest kind of lark Think
how you are saving the old ladys feeling When you are an elderly
person yourself Kit you will appreciate what you are doing tonight

Yes they said they would stand by me and that I was a heroine and the
only person there clever enough to act the part and that they wouldnt
let me stick I am not bitter now but that is what they promised Oh I
am not defending myself I suppose I deserved everything that happened
But they told me that she would be there only between trains and that
she was deaf and that I had an opportunity to save a fellowbeing from
ruin So in the end I capitulated

When they opened the door into the living room Max Reed had arrived and
was helping to hide a decanter and glasses and somebody said a cab was
at the door

And that was the way it began



Chapter III I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT

The minute I had consented I regretted it After all what were Jimmys
troubles to me Why should I help him impose on an unsuspecting elderly
woman And it was only putting off discovery anyhow Sooner or later
she would learn of the divorce andJust at that instant my eyes fell
on Mr HarbisonTom Harbison as Anne called him He was looking on
with an amused halfpuzzled smile while people were rushing around
hiding the roulette wheel and things of which Miss Caruthers might
disapprove and Betty Mercer was on her knees winding up a toy bear that
Max had brought her What would he think It was evident that he thought
badly of us alreadythat he was contemptuously amused and then to have
to ask him to lend himself to the deception

With a gasp I hurled myself after Jimmy only to hear a strange voice in
the hall and to know that I was too late I was in for it whatever was
coming It was Aunt Selina who was comingalong the hall followed by
Jim who was mopping his face and trying not to notice the paralyzed
silence in the library

Aunt Selina met me in the doorway To my frantic eyes she seemed to
tower above us by at least a foot and beside her Jimmy was a red
perspiring cherub

Here she is Jimmy said from behind a temporary eclipse of black
cloak and traveling bag He was on top of the situation now and he was
mendaciously cheerful He had NOT said Here is my wife That would
have been a lie No Jimmy merely said Here she is If Aunt Selina
chose to think me Bella was it not her responsibility And if I chose
to accept the situation was it not mine Dallas Brown came forward
gravely as Aunt Selina folded over and kissed me and surreptitiously
patted me with one hand while he held out the other to Miss Caruthers I
loathed him

We always expect something unusual from James Miss Caruthers he
said with his best manner but THISthis is beyond our wildest
dreams

Well its too awful to linger over Anne took her upstairs and into
Bellas bedroom It was a fancy of Jims to leave that room just as
Bella had left it dusty dance cards and favors hanging around and a
pair of discarded slippers under the bed I dont think it had been
swept since Bella left it I believe in sentiment but I like it brushed
and dusted and the cobwebs off of it and when Aunt Selina put down her
bonnet it stirred up a graywhite cloud that made her cough She did
not say anything but she looked around the room grimly and I saw her
run her finger over the back of a chair before she let Hannah the maid
put her cloak on it

Anne looked frightened She ran into Bellas bath and wet the end of a
towel and when Hannah was changing Aunt Selinas collarher concession
to evening dressAnne wiped off the obvious places on the furniture
She did it stealthily but Aunt Selina saw her in the glass

Whats that young womans name she asked me sharply when Anne had
taken the towel out to hide it

Anne Brown Mrs Dallas Brown I replied meekly Every one replied
meekly to Aunt Selina

Does she live here

Oh no I said airily They are here to dinner she and her husband
They are old friends of Jimsand mine

Seems to have a good eye for dirt said Aunt Selina and went on
fastening her brooch When she was finally ready she took a bead purse
from somewhere about her waist and took out a half dollar She held it
up before Hannahs eyes

Tomorrow morning she said sternly You take off that white cap
and that folderol apron and that black henrietta cloth and put on
a calico wrapper And when youve got this room aired and swept Mrs
Wilson will give you this

Hannah took two steps back and caught hold of a chair she stared
helplessly from Aunt Selina to the half dollar and then at me Anne was
trying not to catch my eye

And another thing Aunt Selina said from the head of the stairs I
sent those towels over from Ireland Tell her to wash and bleach the one
Mrs Whatshername Brown used as a duster

Anne was quite crushed as we went down the stairs I turned once
halfway down and her face was a curious mixture of guilt and hopeless
wrath Over her shoulder I could see Hannah wideeyed and puzzled
staring after us

Jim presented everybody and then he went into the den and closed the
door and we heard him unlock the cellarette Aunt Selina looked at
Leilas bare shoulders and said she guessed she didnt take cold
easily and conversation rather languished Max Reed was looking like a
thundercloud and he came over to me with a lowering expression that I
had learned to dread in him

What fool nonsense is this he demanded What in the world possessed
you Kit to put yourself in such an equivocal position Unlesshe
stopped and turned a little whiteunless you are going to marry Jim

I am sorry for Max He is such a nice boy and good looking too if
only he were not so fierce and did not want to make love to me No
matter what I do Max always disapproves of it I have always had a
deeply rooted conviction that if I should ever in a weak moment marry
Max he would disapprove of that too before I had done it very long

Are you he demanded narrowing his eyesa sign of unusually bad
humor

Am I what

Going to marry him

If you mean Jim I said with dignity I havent made up my mind yet
Besides he hasnt asked me

Aunt Selina had been talking Womans Suffrage in front of the fireplace
but now she turned to me

Is this the vase Cousin Jane Whitcomb sent you as a wedding present
she demanded indicating a hideous urnshaped affair on the mantel It
came to me as an inspiration that Jim had once said it was an ancestral
urn so I said without hesitation that it was And because there was a
pause and every one was looking at us I added that it was a beautiful
thing

Aunt Selina sniffed

Hideous she said It looks like Cousin Jane shape and coloring

Then she looked at it more closely pounced on it turned it upside down
and shook it A card fell out which Dallas picked up and gave her with
a bow Jim had come out of the den and was dancing wildly around and
beckoning to me By the time I had made out that that was NOT the vase
Cousin Jane had sent us as a wedding present Aunt Selina had examined
the card Then she glared across at me and stooping put the card in
the fire I did not understand at all but I knew I had in some way done
the unforgivable thing Later Dal told me it was HER card and that
she had sent the vase to Jim at Christmas with a generous check inside
When she straightened from the fireplace it was to a new theme which
she attacked with her usual vigor The vase incident was over but she
never forgot it She proved that she never did when she sent me two
urnshaped vases with Paul and Virginia on them when Ithat is later
on

The Cause in England has made great strides she announced from the
fireplace Soon the hand that rocks the cradle will be the hand that
actually rules the world Here she looked at me

Im not up on such things Max said blandly having recovered some of
his good humor butisnt it usually a foot that rocks the cradle

Aunt Selina turned on him and Mr Harbison who were standing together
with a snort

What have you or YOU ever done for the independence of woman she
demanded

Mr Harbison smiled He had been looking rather grave until then We
have at least remained unmarried he retorted And then dinner was
again announced

He was to take me out and he came across the room to where I sat
collapsed in a chair and bent over me

Do you know he said looking down at me with his clear disconcerting
gaze do you know that I have just grasped the situation There was
such a noise that I did not hear your name and I am only realizing now
that you are my hostess I dont know why I got the impression that this
was a bachelor establishment but I did Odd wasnt it

I positively couldnt look away from him My features seemed frozen and
my eyes were glued to his As for telling him the truthwell my
tongue refused to move I intended to tell him during dinner if I had
an opportunity I honestly did But the more I looked at him and saw
how candid his eyes were and how stern his mouth might be the more I
shivered at the plunge And of course as everybody knows now I didnt
tell him at all And every moment I expected that awful old woman to
ask me what I paid my cook and when I had changed the color of my
hairBellas being black

Dinner was a half hour late when we finally went out Jimmy leading off
with Aunt Selina and I as hostess trailing behind the procession with
Mr Harbison Dallas took in the two Mercer girls for we were one man
short and Max took Anne Leila Mercer was so excited that she wriggled
and as for me the candles and the orchidseverythingdanced around
in a circle and I just seemed to catch the back of my chair as it flew
past Jim had ordered away the wines and brought out some weak and cheap
Chianti Dallas looked gloomy at the change but Jim explained in
an undertone that Aunt Selina didnt approve of expensive vintages
Naturally the meal was glum enough

Aunt Selina had had her dinner on the train so she spent her time in
asking me questions the length of the table and in getting acquainted
with me She had brought a bottle of some sort of medicine downstairs
with her and she took a claretglassful while she talked The stuff
was called Pomona shall I ever forget it

It was Mr Harbison who first noticed Takahiro Jimmys Jap had been the
only thing in the menage that Bella declared she had hated to leave
But he was doing the strangest things his little black eyes shifted
nervously and he looked queer

Whats wrong with him Mr Harbison asked me finally when he saw that
I noticed Is he ill

Then Aunt Selinas voice from the other end of the table

Bella she called in a high shrill tone do you let James eat
cucumbers

I think he must be I said hurriedly aside to Mr Harbison See how
his hands shake But Selina would not be ignored

Cucumbers and strawberries she repeated impressively I was
saying Bella that cucumbers have always given James the most fearful
indigestion And yet I see you serve them at your table Do you remember
what I wrote you to give him when he has his dreadful spells

I was quite speechless every one was looking and no one could help It
was clear Jim was racking his brain and we sat staring desperately at
each other across the candles Everything I had ever known faded from
me eight pairs of eyes bored into me Mr Harbisons politely amused

I dont remember I said at last Really I dont believe Aunt
Selina smiled in a superior way

Now dont you recall it she insisted I said Baking soda in water
taken internally for cucumbers baking soda and water externally rubbed
on when he gets that dreadful itching strawberry rash

I believe the dinner went on Somebody asked Aunt Selina how much
overcharge she had paid in foreign hotels and after that she was as
harmless as a dove

Then half way through the dinner we heard a crash in Takahiros
pantry and when he did not appear again Jim got up and went out to
investigate He was gone quite a little while and when he came back he
looked worried

Sick he replied to our inquiring glances One of the maids will come
in They have sent for a doctor

Aunt Selina was for going out at once and fixing him up as she put
it but Dallas gently interfered

I wouldnt Miss Caruthers he said in the deferential manner he had
adopted toward her You dont know what it may be Hes been looking
spotty all evening

It might be scarlet fever Max broke in cheerfully I say scarlet
fever on a Mongolianwhat color would he be Jimmy What do yellow and
red make Green

Orange Jim said shortly I wish you people would remember that we
are trying to eat

The fact was however that no one was really eating except Mr
Harbison who had given up trying to understand us considering no
doubt our subdued excitement as our normal condition Ages afterward
I learned that he thought my face almost tragic that night and that he
supposed from the way I glared across the table that I had quarreled
with my husband

I am afraid you are not well he said at last noticing my food
untouched on my plate We should not have come any of us

I am perfectly well I replied feverishly I am never ill II ate a
late luncheon

He glanced at me keenly Dont let them stay and play bridge tonight
he urged Miss Caruthers can be an excuse can she not And you are
really fagged You look it

I think it is only ill humor I said looking directly at him I am
angry at myself I have done something silly and I hate to be silly

Max would have said Impossible or something else trite The Harbison
man looked at me with interested serious eyes

Is it too late to undo it he asked

And then and there I determined that he should never know the truth He
could go back to South America and build bridges and make love to the
Spanish girls or are they Spanish down there and think of me always
as a married woman married to a dilettante artist inclined to be
stoutthe artist not Iand with an Aunt Selina Caruthers who made
buttons and believed in the Cause But never NEVER should he think of
me as a silly little fool who pretended that she was the other mans
wife and had a lump in her throat because when a really nice man came
along a man who knew something more than polo and motors she had to
carry on the deception to keep his respect and be sedate and
matronly and see him change from perfect open admiration at first to a
handsoffsheismyhostswife attitude at last

It can never be undone I said soberly

Well thats the picture as nearly as I can draw it a round table
with a low centerpiece of orchids in lavenders and pink old silver
candlesticks with filigree shades against the somber wainscoting nine
people two of them unhappyJim and I one of them complacentAunt
Selina one puzzledMr Harbison and the rest hysterically mirthful
Add one sick Japanese butler and grind in the mills of the gods

Every one promptly forgot Takahiro in the excitement of the game we were
all playing Finally however Aunt Selina who seemed to have Takahiro
on her mind looked up from her plate

That Jap was speckled she asserted I wouldnt be surprised if its
measles Has he been sniffling James

Has he been sniffling Jim threw across at me

I hadnt noticed it I said meekly while the others choked

Max came to the rescue She refused to eat it he explained
distinctly and to everybody apropos absolutely of nothing It said on
the boxready cooked and predigested She declared she didnt care who
cooked it but she wanted to know who predigested it

As every one wanted to laugh every one did it then and under cover
of the noise I caught Annes eye and we left the dining room The men
stayed and by the very firmness with which the door closed behind us I
knew that Dallas and Max were bringing out the bottles that Takahiro had
hidden I was seething When Aunt Selina indicated a desire to go over
the house it was natural that she should want to it was her house in
a way I excused myself for a minute and flew back to the dining room

It was as I had expected Jim hadnt cheered perceptibly and the
rest were patting him on the back and pouring things out for him and
saying Poor old Jim in the most maddening way And the Harbison man
was looking more and more puzzled and not at all hilarious

I descended on them like a thunderbolt

Thats it I cried shrewishly with my back against the door Leave
her to me all of you and pat each other on the back and say its gone
splendidly Oh I know you every one Mr Harbison got up and pulled
out a chair but I couldnt sit I folded my arms on the back After a
while I suppose youll slip upstairs the four of you and have your
game They looked guilty But I will block that right now I am going
to stayhere If Aunt Selina wants me she can find mehere

The first indication those men had that Mr Harbison didnt know the
state of affairs was when he turned and faced them

Mrs Wilson is quite right he said gravely Were a selfish lot If
Miss Caruthers is a responsibility let us share her

To arms Jim said with an affectation of lightness as they put their
glasses down and threw open the door Dals retort Whose was
lost in the confusion and we went into the library On the way Dallas
managed to speak to me

If Harbison doesnt know dont tell him he said in an undertone
Hes a queer duck in some ways he mightnt think it funny

Funny I choked Its the least funny thing I ever experienced
Deceiving that Harbison man isnt so badhe thinks me crazy anyhow
Hes been staring his eyes out at me

I dont wonder Youre really lovely tonight Kit and you look like a
vixen

But to deceive that harmless old ladywell thank goodness its nine
and she leaves in an hour or so

But she didnt and thats the story



Chapter IV THE DOOR WAS CLOSED

It was infuriating to see how much enjoyment every one but Jim and
myself got out of the situation They howled with mirth over the
feeblest jokes and when Max told a story without any point whatever
they all had hysteria Immediately after dinner Aunt Selina had begun
on the family connection again and after two bad breaks on my part Jim
offered to show her the house The Mercer girls trailed along unwilling
to lose any of the possibilities They said afterward that it was
terrible she went into all the closets and ran her hand over the tops
of doors and kept getting grimmer and grimmer In the studio they came
across a life study Jim was doing and she shut her eyes and made the
girls go out while he covered it with a drapery Lollie Who did the
Bacchante dance at three benefits last winter and was learning a new one
called Eve

When they heard Aunt Selina on the second floor Anne Dal and Max
sneaked up to the studio for cigarettes which left Mr Harbison to me
I was in the den sitting in a low chair by the wood fire when he came
in He hesitated in the doorway

Would you prefer being alone or may I come in he asked Dont mind
being frank I know you are tired

I have a headache and I am sulking I said unpleasantly but at
least I am not actively venomous Come in

So he came in and sat down across the hearth from me and neither of us
said anything The firelight flickered over the room bringing out the
faded hues of the old Japanese prints on the walls gleaming in the
motherofpearl eyes of the dragon on the screen setting a grotesque
god on a cabinet to nodding And it threw into relief the strong profile
of the man across from me as he stared at the fire

I am afraid I am not very interesting I said at last when he
showed no sign of breaking the silence Thethe illness of the butler
andMiss Caruthers arrival have been upsetting

He suddenly roused with a start from a brown reverie

I beg your pardon he said Ioh of course not I was wondering
if Iif you were offended at what I said earlier in the evening
theBrushwood Boy you know and all that

Offended I repeated puzzled

You see I have been living out of the world so long and never seeing
any women but Indian squawsso there were no Spanish girlsthat Im
afraid I say what comes into my mind without circumlocution And thenI
did not know you were married

No oh no I said hastily But of course the more a woman is
marriedI mean you can not say too many nice things to married women
Theyneed them you know

I had floundered miserably with his eyes on me and I half expected him
to be shocked or to say that married women should be satisfied with the
nice things their husbands say to them But he merely remarked apropos
of nothing or following a line of thought he had not voiced that it
was trite but true that a good many men owed their success in life to
their wives

And a good many owe their wives to their success in life I retorted
cynically At which he stared at me again

It was then that the real complexity of the situation began to develop
Some one had rung the bell and been admitted to the library and a maid
came to the door of the den When she saw us she stopped uncertainly
Even then it struck me that she looked odd and she was not in uniform
However I was not informed at that time about bachelor establishments
and the first thing she said when she had asked to speak to me in the
hall knocked her and her clothes clear out of my head Evidently she
knew me

Miss McNair she said in a low tone There is a lady in the drawing
room a veiled person and she is asking for Mr Wilson

Can you not find him I asked He is in the house probably in the
studio

The girl hesitated

Excuse me miss but Miss Caruthers

Then I saw the situation

Never mind I said Close the door into the drawing room and I will
tell Mr Wilson

But as the girl turned toward the doorway the person in question
appeared in it and raised her veil I was perfectly paralyzed It was
Bella Bella in a fur coat and a veil with the most tragic eyes I ever
saw and entirely white except for a dab of rouge in the middle of each
cheek We stared at each other without speech The maid turned and went
down the hall and with that Bella came over to me and clutched me by
the arm

Who was being carried out into that ambulance she demanded glaring
at me with the most awful intensity

Im sure I dont know Bella I said wriggling away from her fingers
What in the world are you doing here I thought you were in Europe

You are hiding something from me she accused It is Jim I see it in
your face

Well it isnt I snapped It seems to me really Bella that you
and Jim ought to be able to manage your own affairs without dragging me
in It was not pleasant but if she was suffering so was I Jim is as
well as he ever was Hes upstairs somewhere Ill send for him

She gripped me again and held on while her color came back

Youll do nothing of the kind she said and she had quite got hold of
herself again I do not want to see him I hope you dont think Kit
that I came here to see James Wilson Why I have forgotten that there
IS such a person and you know it

Somebody upstairs laughed and I was growing nervous What if Aunt
Selina should come down or Mr Harbison come out of the den

Why DID you come then Bella I inquired He may come in

I was passing in the motor she said and I honestly think she hoped I
would believe her and I saw that am She stopped and began again
I thought Jim was out of town and I came to see Takahiro she said
brazenly He was devoted to me and Evans is going to leave Ill tell
you what to do Kit Ill go back to the dining room and you send Taka
there If any one comes I can slip into the pantry

Its immoral I protested Its immoral to steal your

My own butler she broke in impatiently Youre not usually so
scrupulous Kit Hurry I hear that hateful Anne Brown

So we slid back along the hall and I rang for Takahiro But no one
came

I think I ought to tell you Bella I said as we waited and Bella was
staring around the roomI think you ought to know that Miss Caruthers
is here

Bella shrugged her shoulders

Well thank goodness she said I dont have to see her The only
pleasant thing I remember about my year of married life is that I did
NOT meet Aunt Selina

I rang again but still there was no answer And then it occurred to
me that the stillness below stairs was almost oppressive Bella was
noticing things too for she began to fasten her veil again with a
malicious little smile

One of the things I remember my late husband saying she observed
was that HE could manage this house and had done it for years with
flawless service Stand on the bell Kit

I did We stood there with the table just as it had been left between
us and waited for a response Bella was growing impatient She raised
her eyebrows she is very handsome Bella is and flung out her chin as
if she had begun to enjoy the horrible situation

I thought I heard a rattle of silver from the pantry just then and I
hurried to the door in a rage But the pantry was empty of servants and
full of dishes and all the lights were out but one which was burning
dimly I could have sworn that I saw one of the servants duck into the
stairway to the basement but when I got there the stairs were empty
and something was burning in the kitchen below

Bella had followed me and was peering over my shoulder curiously

There isnt a servant in the house she said triumphantly And when we
went down to the kitchen she seemed to be right It was in disgraceful
order and one of the bottles of wine that had ben banished from the
dining room sat half empty on the floor

Drunk Bella said with conviction But I didnt think so There had
not been time enough for one thing Suddenly I remembered the ambulance
that had been the cause of Bellas appearancefor no one could believe
her silly story about Takahiro I didnt wait to voice my suspicion to
her I simply left her there staring helplessly at the confusion and
ran upstairs again through the dining room past Jimmy and Aunt Selina
past Leila Mercer and Max who were flirting on the stairs up up to
the servants bedrooms and there my suspicions were verified There was
every evidence of a hasty flight in three bedrooms five trunks stood
locked and ominous and the closets yawned with open doors empty Bella
had been right there was not a servant in the house

As I emerged from the untidy emptiness of the servants wing I met Mr
Harbison coming out of the studio

I wish you would let me do some of this running about for you Mrs
Wilson he said gravely You are not well and I cant think of
anything worse for a headache Has the butlers illness clogged the
household machinery

Worse I replied trying not to breathe in gasps I wouldnt be
running aroundlike thisbut there is not a servant in the house They
have gone the entire lot

Thats odd he said slowly Gone Are you sure

In reply I pointed to the servants wing Trunks packed I said
tragically rooms empty kitchen and pantries full of dishes Did you
ever hear of anything like it

Never he asserted It makes me suspect What he suspected he did
not say instead he turned on his heel without a word of explanation
and ran down the stairs I stood staring after him wondering if every
one in the place had gone crazy Then I heard Betty Mercer scream and
the rest talking loud and laughing and Mr Harbison came up the stairs
again two at a time

How long has that Jap been ailing Mrs Wilson he asked

II dont know I replied helplessly What is the trouble anyhow

I think he probably has something contagious he said and it
has scared the servants away As Mr Brown said he looked spotty I
suggested to your husband that it might be as well to get the house
emptiedin case we are correct

Oh yes by all means I said eagerly I couldnt get away too soon
Ill go and get my Then I stopped Why the man wouldnt expect me
to leave I would have to play out the wretched farce to the end

Ill go down and see them off I finished lamely and we went together
down the stairs

Just for the moment I forgot Bella altogether I found Aunt Selina
bonneted and cloaked taking a stirrup cup of Pomona for her nerves
and the rest throwing on their wraps in a hurry Downstairs Max was
telephoning for his car which wasnt due for an hour and Jim was
walking up and down swearing under his breath With the prospect of
getting rid of them all and of going home comfortably to try to forget
the whole wretched affair I cheered up quite a lot I even played up my
part of hostess and Dallas told me aside that I was a brick

Just then Jim threw open the front door

There was a man on the top step with his mouth full of tacks and he
was nailing something to the door just below Jims Florentine bronze
knocker and standing back with his head on one side to see if it was
straight

What are you doing Jim demanded fiercely but the man only drove
another tack It was Mr Harbison who stepped outside and read the card

It said Smallpox

Smallpox Mr Harbison read as if he couldnt believe it Then he
turned to us huddled in the hall

It seems it wasnt measles after all he said cheerfully I move we
get into Mr Reeds automobile out there and have a vaccination party
I suppose even you blase society folk have not exhausted that kind of
diversion

But the man on the step spat his tacks in his hand and spoke for the
first time

No you dont he said Not on your life Just step back please and
close the door This house is quarantined



Chapter V FROM THE TREE OF LOVE

There is hardly any use trying to describe what followed Anne Brown
began to cry and talk about the children She went to Europe once and
stayed until they all got over the whooping cough And Dallas said he
had a pull because his mill controlled I forget how many votes and the
thing to do was to be quiet and comfortable and we would get out in
the morning Max took it as a huge joke and somebody found him at
the telephone calling up his club The Mercer girls were hysterically
giggling and Aunt Selina sat on a stiffbacked chair and took aromatic
spirits of ammonia As for Jim he had collapsed on the lowest step of
the stairs and sat there with his head in his hands When he did look
up he didnt dare to look at me

The Harbison man was arguing with the impassive individual on the top
step outside and I saw him get out his pocketbook and offer a crisp
bundle of bills But the man from the board of health only smiled and
tacked at his offensive sign After a while Mr Harbison came in and
closed the door and we stared at one another

I know what Im going to do I said swallowing a lump in my throat
Im going to get out through a basement window at the back Im going
home

Home Aunt Selina gasped jumping up and almost dropping her ammonia
bottle My dear Bella Home

Jimmy groaned at the foot of the stairs but Anne Brown was getting over
her tears and now she turned on me in a temper

Its all your fault she said I was going to stay at home and get a
little sleep

Well you can sleep now Dallas broke in Therell be nothing to do
but sleep

I think you havent grasped the situation Dal I said icily There
will be plenty to do There isnt a servant in the house

No servants everybody cried at once The Mercer girls stopped
giggling

Holy cats Max stopped in the act of hanging up his overcoat Do you
meanwhy I cant shave myself Ill cut my head off

Youll do more than that I retorted grimly You will carry coal and
tend fires and empty ash pans and when you are not doing any of those
things there will be pots and pans to wash and beds to make

Then there WAS a row We had worked back to the den now and I stood in
front of the fireplace and let the storm beat around me and tried
to look perfectly cold and indifferent and not to see Mr Harbisons
shocked face No wonder he thought them a lot of savages browbeating
their hostess the way they did

Its a fool thing anyhow Max Reed wound up to celebrate the
anniversary of a divorceespecially Here he caught Jims eye and
stopped But I had suddenly remembered BELLA DOWN IN THE BASEMENT

Could anything have been worse And of course she would have hysteria
and then turn on me and blame me for it all It all came over me at once
and overwhelmed me while Anne was crying and saying she wouldnt cook
if she starved for it and Aunt Selina was taking off her wraps I felt
queer all over and I sat down suddenly Mr Harbison was looking at me
and he brought me a glass of wine

It wont be so bad as you fear he said comfortingly There will be
no danger once we are vaccinated and many hands make light work They
are pretty raw now because the thing is new to them but by morning
they will be reconciled

It isnt the work it is something entirely different I said And it
was Bella and work could hardly be spoken in the same breath

If I had only turned her out as she deserved to be when she first came
instead of allowing her to carry through the wretched farce about seeing
Takahiro Or if I had only run to the basement the moment the house was
quarantined and got her out the areaway or the coal hole And now time
was flying and Aunt Selina had me by the arm and any moment I expected
Bella to pounce on us through the doorway and the whole situation to
explode with a bang

It was after eleven before they were rational enough to discuss ways and
means and of course the first thing suggested was that we all adjourn
below stairs and clean up after dinner I could have slain Max Reed for
the notion and the Mercer girls for taking him up

Of course we will they said in a duet What a lark And they
actually began to pin up their dinner gowns It was Jim who stopped
that

Oh look here you people he objected Im not going to let you do
that Well get some servants in tomorrow Ill go down and put out the
lights There will be enough clean dishes for breakfast

It was lucky for me that they started a new discussion then and there
about who would get the breakfast In the midst of the excitement I
slipped away to carry the news to Bella She was where I had left her
and she had made herself a cup of tea and was very much at home which
was natural

Do you know she said ominously that you have been away for two
hours and that I have gone through agonies of nervousness for fear Jim
Wilson would come down and think I came here to see him

No one would think that Bella I soothed her Everybody knows you
loathe himJim too She looked at me over the edge of her cup

Ill run along now she said since Takahiro isnt here And if Jim
has any sense at all he will clear out every maid in the house I never
saw such a kitchen in all my life Well lead the way Kit I suppose
they are deep in bridge or roulette or something

She was fixing her veil and I saw I would have to tell her Personally
I would much rather have told her the house was on fire

Wait a minute Bella I said You see something queer has happened
You know this is the anniversarywell you know what it isand Jim was
awfully glum So we thought we would come

What are you driving at she demanded You are seagreen Kit Whats
the matter You neednt think I mind because Jim has a jollification to
celebrate his divorce

Itit was Takahiroin the ambulance I blurted Smallpox
WeBella we are shut in quarantined

She didnt faint She just sat down and stared at me and I stared back
at her Then a miserable alarm clock on the table suddenly went off like
an explosion and Bella began to laugh I knew what that washysteria
She always had attacks like that when things went wrong I was quite
despairing by that time I hoped they would all hear her and come
downstairs and take her up and put her to bed like a Christian so she
could giggle her soul out But after a bit she quieted down and began to
cry softly and I knew the worst was over I gave her a shake and she
was so angry that she got over it altogether

Kit you are horrid she choked Dont you see what a position I am
in I am not going upstairs to face Anne and the rest of them You can
just put me in the coal cellar

Isnt there a window you could get through I asked desperately
Locking the door doesnt shut up a whole house

Bellas courage revived at that and she said yes there were windows
plenty of them only she didnt see how she could get out And I
said she would HAVE to get out because I was playing Bella in the
performance and I didnt care to have an understudy Then the situation
dawned on her and she sat down and laughed herself weak in the knees
Of course she wanted to stay then and see the fun out But I was firm
she would have to go and I told her so Things were complicated enough
without her

Well we looked funny no doubt Bella in a Russian pony automobile coat
over the black satin she had worn at the Clevelands dinner and I in
cream lace the skirt gathered up from the kitchen floor with Bellas
ermine pelerine around my bare shoulders and dishes and overturned
chairs everywhere

Bella knew more about the lower regions of her exhome than I would have
thought She opened a door in a corner and led the way through a narrow
hall past the refrigerating room to a huge cemented cellar with a
furnace in the center and a halfdozen electric lights making it really
brilliant

Get a chair Bella said over her shoulder excitedly I can get out
easily here through the coal hole Imagine my

But it was my turn to grip Bella From behind the furnace were coming
the most terrible sounds rasping noises that fairly frayed the silk of
my nerves We stood petrified for an instant Then Bella laughed They
are not all gone she said carefully Some one is asleep there

We tiptoed to where we could see around the furnace and sure enough
some one WAS asleep there Only it was not one of the servants it was
a portly policeman with a newspaper and an empty plate on the floor on
one side and a champagne bottle on the other He had slid down in his
chair with his chin on his brass buttons and his helmet had rolled a
dozen feet away Bella had to clap her hand over her mouth

Fairly caught she whispered Sartor Resartus the arrester arrested
Oh Jim and his flawless service

But after we got over our surprise we saw the situation was serious
The policeman was threatening to awaken Once he stopped snoring to yawn
noisily and we beat a hasty retreat Bella switched off the lights in
a hurry and locked the door behind us We hardly breathed until we were
back in the kitchen again and everything quiet And then Jimmy called
my name from up above somewheres

I am going to call him down Bella I said firmly Let him help you
out Im sure I dont see why I should have all this when the two of
you

Oh no no Surely Kit you wouldnt be so cruel she whispered
pleadingly You know what he would think Heoh Kit let them all get
settled for the night and then come down like a dear and help me out
I know loads of wayshonestly I do

If I leave you here I debated what about the policeman

Never mind himfrantically Listen Theres Jim up in the pantry
Run for the sake of Heaven

SoI ran At the top of the stairs I met Jimmy very crumpled as to
shirtfront and dejected as to face

Ive been hunting everywhere for you he said dismally I thought you
had added to the general merriment by falling downstairs and breaking
your neck

I went past him with my chin up Now that I had time to think about it
I was furiously angry with him

Kit he called after me appealingly but I would not hear Then he
adopted different tactics He took advantage of my catching my foot in
the lace of my gown to pass me and to stand with his back against the
door

Youre not going until you hear me Kit he declared miserably In
the first place for all you are down on me is it my fault Honestly
now IS IT MY FAULT

I refused to speak

I was coming home to be miserable alone he went on andoh I know
you meant well Kit but YOU asked all these crazy people here

Perhaps you will give me credit for some things I said wearily I
did NOT give Takahiro smallpox for instance andif you will permit me
to mention the factAunt Selina is not MY Aunt Selina

Thats what I wanted to speak to you about Jimmy went on wretchedly
trying not to look at me You see when they were rowing so about who
would get the breakfastI never saw such a lot of people half of
them never touch breakfast but of course now they want all kinds of
thingswhen they were talking Aunt Selina said she knew YOU would get
it being the hostess and responsible besides knowing where things
are kept He had fixed his eyes on the orchids and he looked shrunken
actually shrunken I thought he finished you might give me a few
pointers now and I could come down in the morning andand fuss up
something coffee and so on I would say you did it Oh hang it all
Kit why dont you say something

What do you want me to say I demanded That I love to cook and of
course Ill fix trays and carry them up in the morning to Anne Brown
and Leila Mercer and the rest and that I will have the shaving water
ready

I know what Im going to do Jimmy said with a sudden resolution
Aunt Selina and her money can go to blazes I am going right upstairs
and tell her the truth tell her who you are what I am and all the
rest of it He opened the door

Youll do nothing of the kind I gasped catching him in time Dont
you dare Jimmy Wilson Why what would they think of me After letting
her call me Bella and himJim if Mr Harbison ever learns the
truthII will take poison If we are going to be shut up here
together we will have to carry it on I couldnt stand the disgrace

In spite of an heroic effort Jim looked relieved They have been
hunting for the linen closet he said more cheerfully and there will
be room enough I think Harbison and I will hang out in the studio
there are two couches there Im afraid youll have to take Aunt Selina
Kit

Certainly I said coldly That was the way it was all along Whenever
there was something to do that no one else would undertakeany
unpleasant responsibilitythat entire mongrel household turned with one
gesture and pointed its finger at me Well it is over now and I ought
not to be bitter considering everything

It was quite characteristic of that memorable evening that is quite
novelesque I think that my interview with Jimmy should have a
sensational ending He was terribly down of course and as I was trying
to pass him to get to the door he caught my hand

Youre a girl in a thousand Kit he said forlornly If I were not so
damnably hopelessly idiotically in love withsomebody else I should
be crazy about you

Dont be maudlin I retorted Would you mind letting my hand go I
felt sure Bella could hear

Oh come now Kit he implored weve always got along so well Its
a shame to let a thing like this make us bad friends Arent you ever
going to forgive me

Never I said promptly When I once get away I dont want ever to
see you again I was never so humiliated in my life I loathe you

Then I turned around and of course there was Aunt Selina with her
eyes protruding until you could have knocked them off with a stick and
beside her very red and uncomfortable Mr Harbison

Bella she said in a shocked voice is that the way you speak to your
husband It is high time I came here I think and took a hand in this
affair

Oh never mind Aunt Selina Jim said with a sheepish grin
KitBella is tired and nervous This is a hdeuce of a situation
Noerservants and all that

But Aunt Selina did mind and showed it She pulled the unlucky Harbison
man through the door and closed it and then stood glaring at both of
us

Every little quarrel is an apple knocked from the tree of love she
announced oratorically

This was a very little quarrel Jim said edging toward the door
aa green apple Aunt Selina a colicky little green apple But she
was not to be diverted

Bella she said severely you said you loathed him You didnt mean
that

But I do I cried hysterically There isnt any word to tell how
Ihow I detest him

Then I swept past them all and flew to Bellas dressing room and locked
myself in Aunt Selina knocked until she was tired then gave up and
went to bed

That was the night Anne Browns pearl collar was stolen



Chapter VI A MIGHTY POOR JOKE

Of course one knows that there are people who in a different grade of
society would be shoplifters and pickpockets When they are restrained
by obligation or environment they become a little overkeen at bridge
or take the wrong sables or stuff a goldbacked brush into a muff at
a reception You remember the ivory dressing set that Theodora Bucknell
had fastened with fine gold chains And the sensation it caused at the
Bucknell cotillion when Mrs Van Zire went sweeping to her carriage with
two feet of gold chain hanging from the front of her wrap

But Annes pearl collar was different In the first place instead of
three or four hundred people the suspicion had to be divided among ten
And of those ten at least eight of us were friends and the other two
had been vouched for by the Browns and Jimmy It was a horrible mixup
For the necklace was gonethere couldnt be any doubt of thatand
although as Dallas said it couldnt get out of the house still there
were plenty of places to hide the thing

The worst of our trouble really originated with Max Reed after all
For it was Max who made the silly wager over the telephone with Dick
Bagley He bet five hundred even that one of us at least would break
quarantine within the next twentyfour hours and of course that
settled it Dick told it around the club as a joke and a man who owns
a newspaper heard him and called up the paper Then the paper called up
the health office after setting up a flaming scarehead Will Money
Free Them Board of Health versus Millionaire

It was almost three when the house settled downnobody had any night
clothes although finally through Dallas who gave them to Anne who
gave them to the rest we got some things of Jimmysand I was still
dressed The house was perfectly quiet and after listening carefully
I went slowly down the stairs There was a light in the hall and
another back in the dining room and I got along without any trouble
But the pantry where the stairs led down was dark and the wretched
swinging door would not stay open

I caught my skirt in the door as I went through and I had to stop to
loosen it And in that awful minute I heard some one breathing just
beside me I had stooped to my gown and I turned my head without
straighteningI couldnt have raised myself to an erect posture for
my knees were giving way under meand just at my feet lay the still
glowing end of a match

I had to swallow twice before I could speak Then I said sharply

Whos there

The man was so close it is a wonder I had not walked into him his voice
was right at my ear

I am sorry I startled you he said quietly I was afraid to speak
suddenly or move for fear I would dowhat I have done

It was Mr Harbison

II thought you wereit is very late I managed to say with dry
lips Do you know where the electric switch is

Mrs Wilson It was clear he had not known me before Why no dont
you

I am all confused I muttered and beat a retreat into the dining
room There in the friendly light we could at least see each other
and I think he was as much impressed by the fact that I had not
undressed as I was by the fact that he HAD partly He wore a hideous
dressing gown of Jimmys much too small and his hair parted and
plastered down in the early evening stood up in a sort of brown brush
all over his head He was trying to flatten it with his hands

It must be three oclock he said with polite surprise and the
house is like a barn You ought not to be running around with your arms
uncovered Mrs Wilson Surely you could have called some of us

I didnt wish to disturb any one I said with distinct truth

I suppose you are like me he said The novelty of the situationand
everything I got to thinking things over and then I realized the
studio was getting cold so I thought I would come down and take a look
at the furnace I didnt suppose any one else would think of it But
I lost myself in that pantry stumbled against a halfopen drawer and
nearly went down the dumbwaiter And as if in judgment on me at
that instant came two rather terrific thumps from somewhere below
and inarticulate words shouted rather than spoken It was uncanny of
course coming as it did through the register at our feet Mr Harbison
looked startled

Oh by the way I said as carelessly as I could In the excitement
I forgot to mention it There is a policeman asleep in the furnace room
II suppose we will have to keep him now I finished as airily as
possible

Oh a policemanin the cellar he repeated staring at me and he
moved toward the pantry door

You neednt go down I said feverishly with visions of Bella Knowles
sitting on the kitchen table surrounded by soiled dishes and all the
cheerless aftermath of a dinner party Please dont go down Iits
one of my rulesnever to let a stranger go down to the kitchen IIm
peculiarthat wayand besides itsits mussy

Bang Crash through the register pipe and some language quite
articulate Then silence

Look here Mrs Wilson he said resolutely What do I care about the
kitchen Im going down and arrest that policeman for disturbing the
peace He will have the pipes down

You must not go I said with desperate firmness Hehe is probably
in a very dangerous state just now WeIlocked him in

The Harbison man grinned and then became serious

Why dont you tell me the whole thing he demanded Youve been in
trouble all evening andyou can trust me you know because I am a
stranger because the minute this crazy quarantine is raised I am off
to the Argentine Republic perhaps he said Chili and because I dont
know anything at all about you You see I have to believe what you
tell me having no personal knowledge of any of you to go on Now tell
mewhom have you hidden in the cellar besides the policeman

There was no use trying to deceive him he was looking straight into my
eyes So I decided to make the best of a bad thing Anyhow it was going
to require strength to get Bella through the coal hole with one arm and
restrain the policeman with the other

Come I said making a sudden resolution and led the way down the
stairs

He said nothing when he saw Bella for which I was grateful She was
sitting at the table with her arms in front of her and her head buried
in them And then I saw she was asleep Her hat and veil were laid
beside her and she had taken off her coat and draped it around her She
had rummaged out a cold pheasant and some salad and had evidently had
a little supper Supper and a nap while I worried myself grayheaded
about her

Sheshe came in unexpectedlysomething about the butler I explained
under my breath Andshe doesnt want to stay She is on bad terms
withwith some of the people upstairs You can see how impossible the
situation is

I doubt if we can get her out he said as if the situation were quite
ordinary However we can try She seems very comfortable Its a pity
to rouse her

Here the prisoner in the furnace room broke out afresh It sounded
as though he had taken a lump of coal and was attacking the lock Mr
Harbison followed the noise and I could hear him arguing not gently

Another sound he finished and you wont get out of here at all
unless you crawl up the furnace pipe

When he came back Bella was rousing She lifted her head with her eyes
shut and then opened them one at a time blinked and sat up She didnt
see him at first

You wretch she said ungratefully after she had yawned Do you know
what time it is And that Then she saw Mr Harbison and sat staring
at him

This is Mr Harbison I said to her hastily Hehe came with Anne
and Dal andhe is shut in too

By that time Bella had seen how handsome he was and she took a hair pin
out of her mouth and arched her eyebrows which was always Bellas best
pose

I am Miss Knowles she said sweetly of course the court had given
her back her name and I stopped in tonight thinking the house
was empty to see about aa butler Unfortunately the house was
quarantined just at that time andhere I am Surely there can not be
any harm in helping me to get out Pleading tone I have not been
exposed to any contagion and in the exhausted state of my health the
confinement would be positively dangerous

She rolled her eyes at him and I could see she was making an
impression Of course she was free She had a perfect right to marry
again but I will say this Bella is a lot better looking by electric
light than she is the next morning

The upshot of it was that the gentleman who built bridges and looked
down on society from a lofty lonely pinnacle agreed to help one of the
most gleaming members of the aforesaid society to outwit the law

It took about fifteen minutes to quiet the policeman Nobody ever knew
what Mr Harbison did to him but for twentyfour hours he was quite
tractable He changed after that but that comes later in the story
Anyhow the Harbison man went upstairs and came down with a Bagdad
curtain and a cushion to match and took them into the furnace room
and came out and locked the door behind him and then we were ready for
Bellas escape

But there were four special officers and three reporters watching the
house as a result of Max Reeds idiocy Once after trying all the
other windows and finding them guarded we discovered a little bit of a
hole in an outoftheway corner that looked like a ventilator and was
covered with a heavy wire screen No prisoners ever dug their way out of
a dungeon with more energy than that with which we attached that screen
hacking at it with kitchen knives whispering like conspirators being
scratched with the ragged edges of the wire frozen with the cold air
one minute and boiling with excitement the next And when the wire was
cut and Bella had rolled her coat up and thrust it through and was
standing on a chair ready to follow something outside that had looked
like a barrel moved and said Oh I wouldnt do that if I were you
It would be certain to be undignified and probably it would be
unpleasantlater

We coaxed and pleaded and tried to bribe and that happened as it
turned out to be one of the worst things we had to endure For the
whole conversation came out the next afternoon in the paper with the
most awful drawings and the reporter said it was the flashing of the
jewels we wore that first attracted his attention And that brings me
back to the robbery

For when we had crept back to the kitchen and Bella was fumbling
for her handkerchief to cry into and the Harbison man was trying to
apologize for the language he had used to the reporter and I was on the
verge of a nervous chillwell it was then that Bella forgot all about
crying and jumped and held out her arm

My diamond bracelet she screeched Look Ive lost it

Well we went over every inch of that basement until I knew every crack
in the flooring every spot on the cement And Bella was nasty and said
that she had never seen that part of the house in such condition and
that if I had acted like a sane person and put her out when she had no
business there at all she would have had her freedom and her bracelet
and that if we were playing a joke on her as if we felt like joking
we would please give her the bracelet and let her go and die in a
corner she felt very queer

At halfpast four oclock we gave up

Its gone I said I dont believe you wore it here No one could
have taken it There wasnt a soul in this part of the house except the
policeman and hes locked in

At five oclock we put her to sleep in the den She was in a fearful
temper and I was glad enough to be able to shut the door on her Tom
Harbisonthat was his namehelped me to creep upstairs and wanted
to get me a glass of ale to make me sleep But I said it would be of no
use as I had to get up and get the breakfast The last thing he said
was that the policeman seemed above the average in intelligence and
perhaps we could train him to do plain cooking and dishwashing

I did not go to sleep at once I lay on the chintzcovered divan in
Bellas dressing room and stared at the picture of her with the violets
underneath I couldnt see what there was about Bella to inspire such
undying devotion but I had to admit that she had looked handsome that
night and that the Harbison man had certainly been impressed

At seven oclock Jimmy Wilson pounded at my door and I could have
choked him joyfully I dragged myself to the door and opened it and
then I heard excited voices Everybody seemed to be up but Aunt Selina
and they were all talking at once

Anne Brown was in the corner of the group waving her hands while
Dallas was trying to hook the back of her gown with one hand and hold a
blanket around himself with the other No one was dressed except Anne
and she had been up for an hour looking in shoes and under the corners
of rugs and around the bed clothing for her jeweled collar When she saw
me she began all over again

I had it on when I went into my room she declared and I put it on
the dressing table when I undressed I meant to put it under my pillow
but I forgot And I didnt sleep well I was awake half the night
Wasnt I Dal Then when the clock downstairs in the hall was chiming
five something roused me and I sat up in bed It was still dark but I
pinched Dal and said there was somebody in the room You remember that
dont you Dal

I thought you had nightmare he said sheepishly

I lay still for ages it seemed to me and thenthe door into the
hall closed I heard the catch click I turned on the light over the bed
then and the room was empty I thought of my collar and although it
seemed ridiculous with the house sealed as it is and all of us friends
for yearswell I got up and looked and it was gone

No one spoke for an instant It WAS a queer situation for the collar
was gone Annes red eyes showed it was true And there we stood every
one of us a miserable picture of guilt and tried to look innocent and
debonair and unsuspicious Finally Jim held up his hand and signified
that he wanted to say something

Its like this he said until this thing is cleared up for Heavens
sake lets try to be sane If every fellow thinks the other fellow
did it this house will be a nice little hell to live in And if
anybodyhere he glared aroundif anybody has got funny and is hiding
those jewels I want to say that hed better speak up now Later it
wont be so easy for him Its a mighty poor joke

But nobody spoke



Chapter VII WE MAKE AN OMELET

It was Betty Mercer who said she was hungry and got us switched from
the delicate subject of which was the thief to the quite as pressing
subject of which was to be cook Aunt Selina had slept quietly through
the whole thingwe learned afterward that she customarily slept on her
left side which was on her good ear We gathered in the Dallas Browns
room and Jimmy proposed a plan

We can have anything sent in that we want he suggested speciously
and if Dal doesnt make good with the city fathers you girls can
get some clothes anyhow Then we can have dinner sent from one of the
hotels

Why not all the meals Max suggested I hope youre not going to be
small about things Jimmy

It ought to be easy Jim persisted ignoring the remark for nine
reasonably intelligent people to boil eggs and make coffee which is all
we need for breakfast with some fruit

Nine of us Dallas said wickedly looking at Tom Harbison who was
out of earshot Why nine of us I thought Kit here otherwise known as
Bella was going to show off her housewifely skill

It ended however with Mr Harbison writing out a lot of slips cook
scullerymaid chambermaid parlormaid furnaceman and butler and
as that left two people overwe didnt count Aunt Selinahe added
another furnaceman and a trained nurse Betty Mercer drew the trained
nurse slip and of course she was delighted It seems funny now to
look back and think what a dreadful time she really had for Aunt Selina
took the grippe you know that very day

It was fate that I should go back to that awful kitchen for of course
my slip said cook Mr Harbison was butler and Max and Dal got the
furnace although neither of them had ever been nearer to a bucket of
coal than the coupons on mining stock Anne got the bedrooms and Leila
was parlormaid It was Jimmy who got the scullery work but he was
quite crushed by this time and did not protest at all

Max was in a very bad temper I suppose he had not had enough sleepno
one had But he came over while the lottery was going on and stood over
me and demanded unpleasantly in a whisper that I stop masquerading as
another mans wife and generally making a fool of myselfwhich is the
way he put it And I knew in my heart that he was right and I hated him
for it

Why dont you go and tell himthem I asked nastily No one was
paying any attention to us Tell them that to be obliging I have
nearly drowned in a sea of lies tell them that I am not only not
married but that I never intend to marry tell them that we are a lot
of idiots with nothing better to do than to trifle with strangers within
our gates people who buildI mean people that are worth two to our
one Run and tell them

He looked at me for a minute then he turned on his heel and left me It
looked as though Max might be going to be difficult

While I was improvising an apron out of a towel and Anne was pinning a
sheet into a kimono so she could take off her dinner gown and still be
proper Dallas harked back to the robbery

Ann put the collar on the table there he said Theres no mistake
about that I watched her do it for I remember thinking it was the sole
reminder I had that Consolidated Traction ever went above thirtynine

Max was looking around the room examining the window locks and
whistling between his teeth He was in disgrace with every one for by
that time it was light enough to see three reporters with cameras across
the street waiting for enough sun to snap the house and everybody knew
that it was Max and his idiotic wager that had done it He had made two
or three conciliatory remarks but no one would speak to him His antics
were so queer however that we were all watching him and when he had
felt over the rug with his hands and raised the edges and tried to
lift out the chair seats and had shaken out Dals shoes he said people
often hid things and then forgot about it he made a proposition

If you will take that infernal furnace from around my neck Ill
undertake either to find the jewels or to show up the thief he
said quietly And of course with all the people in the house under
suspicion every one had to hail the suggestion with joy and to offer
his assistance and Jimmy had to take Maxs share of the furnace So
they took the scullery slip downstairs to the policeman and gave Jim
Maxs share of the furnace Yes I had broken the policeman to them
gently Of course Anne said at once that he was the thief but they
found him tucked in and sound asleep with his back against the furnace

In the first place Max said standing importantly in the middle of
the room we retired between two and threenearer three So the
theft occurred between three and five when Anne woke up Was your door
locked Dal

No The door into the hall was but the door into the dressing room was
open and we found the door from there into the hall open this morning

From three until five Max repeated Was any one out of his room
during that time

I was said Tom Harbison promptly from the foot of the bed I was
prowling all around somewhere about four searchinghe glanced at
mefor a drink of water But as I dont know a pearl from a glass
bead I hope you exonerate me

Everybody laughed and said Of course and Sure old man and
changed the subject quickly

While that excitement was on I got Jim to one side and told him about
Bella His goodnatured face was radiant at first

I suppose she DID come to see Takahiro eh Kit he asked delicately
She didnt say anything about me

Nothing good She said the house was in a disgraceful condition I
said heartlessly And her diamond bracelet was stolen while she took
a nap on the kitchen tablehe groanedandoh Jim you are such
a goose If I could only manage my own affairs the way I could my
friends Shes too sure of you Jimmy She knows you adore her
andhow brutal could you be Jim

Fair he said I may have undiscovered depths of brutality that I
have never had occasion to use However I might try Why

Listen Jim I urged It was always Bella who did things here she
managed the house she tyrannized over her friends and she bullied you
Yes she did Now shes here without your invitation and she has to
stay Its your turn to bully to dictate terms to be coldly civil or
politely rude Make her furious at you If she is jealous so much the
better

How far would you sacrifice yourself on the altar of friendship he
asked

You may pay me all the attention you like in public I replied and
after we shook hands we went together to Bella

There was an ominous pause when we went into the den Bella was sitting
by the register with her furs on and after one glance over her
shoulder at us she looked away again without speaking

Bella Jim said appealingly And then I pinched his arm and he drew
himself up and looked properly outraged

Bella he said coldly this time I cant imagine why you have put
yourself in this ridiculous position but since you have

She turned on him in a fury

Put MYSELF in this position

She was frantic Its a plot a wretched trick of yours this
quarantine to keep me here

Jim gasped but I gave him a warning glance and he swallowed hard

On the contrary he said with maddening quiet I would be the last
person in the world to wish to perpetuate an indiscretion of yours For
it was hardly discreet was it to visit a bachelor establishment alone
at ten oclock at night As far as my plotting to keep you here is
concerned I assure you that nothing could be further from my mind Our
paths were to be two parallel lines that never touch He looked at me
for approval and Bella was choking

You are worse that I ever thought you she stormed I thought you
were only aa fool Now I know youfor a brute

Well it ended by Jims graciously permitting Bella to remainthere
being nothing else to doand by his magnanimously agreeing to keep her
real identity from Aunt Selina and Mr Harbison and to break the news
of her presence to Anne and the rest It created a sensation beside
which Annes pearls faded away although they came to the front again
soon enough

Jim broke the news at once gathering everybody but Harbison and Aunt
Selina in the upper hall He was palpitatingly nervous but he tried to
carry it off with a high hand

Its unfortunate he said looking around the circle of faces each
one frozen with amazement and just a suspicion perhaps of incredulity
Its particularly unfortunate for her You all know how highstrung
she is and if the papers should get hold of itwell well all have to
make it as easy as we can for her

With Jims eyes on them they all swallowed the butler story without a
gulp But Anne was indignant

Its like Bella she snapped Well she has made her bed and she can
lie on it Im sure I shant make it for her But if you want to know my
opinion Mr Harbison may be a fool but you cant ram two Bellas both
NEE Knowles down Miss Caruthers throat with a stick

We had not thought of that before and every one looked blank Finally
however Jim said Bellas middle name was Constantia and we decided to
call her that But it turned out afterward that nobody could remember
it in a hurry and generally when we wanted to attract her attention we
walked across the room and touched her on the shoulder It was quicker
and safer

The name decided we went downstairs in a line to welcome Bella to try
to make her feel at home and to forget her deplorable situation Leila
had worked herself into a really sympathetic frame of mind

Poor dear she said on the way down Now dont grin anybody just
be cordial and glad to see her I hope she doesnt cry you know the
spells she takes

We stopped outside the door and everybody tried to look cheerful and
sympathetic and not grinnywhich was as hard as looking as if we had
had a cup of teaand then Jim threw the door open and we filed in

Bella was comfortably reading by the fire She had her feet up on a
stool and a pillow behind her head She did not even look at us for a
minute then she merely glanced up as she turned a page

Dear me she said mockingly what a lot of frumps you all are I had
hoped it was some one with my breakfast

Then she went on reading As Leila said afterward that kind of person
OUGHT to be divorced

Aunt Selina came down just then and I left everybody trying to explain
Bellas presence to her and fled to the kitchen The Harbison man
appeared while I was sitting hopelessly in front of the gas range and
showed me about it

I dont know that I ever saw one he said cheerfully but I know the
theory Likewise by the same token this tea kettle set on the flame
will boil That is not theory however that is early knowledge Polly
put the kettle on well all take tea Look at that Mrs Wilson I
didnt fight bacilli with boiled water at Chickamauga for nothing

And then he let out the policeman and brought him into the kitchen He
was a large man and his face was a curious mixture of amazement alarm
and dignity No doubt we did look queer still in parts of our evening
clothes and I in the white silk and lace petticoat that belonged under
my gown with a yellow and black pajama coat of Jimmys as a sort of
breakfast jacket

This is Officer Flannigan Mr Harbison said I explained our
unfortunate position earlier in the morning and he is prepared to
accept our hospitality Flannigan every person in this house has got
to work as I also explained to you You are appointed dishwasher and
scullery maid

The policeman looked dazed Then slowly like dawn over a sleeping
lake a light of comprehension grew in his face

Sure he said laying his helmet on the table Ill be glad to be
doing anything I can to help Me and Mrs Wilsonwe used to be friends
Its many the time Ive opened the carriage door for her and she with
her head in the air and for all that the pleasant smile When any one
around her was having a party and wanted a special officer it was Mrs
Wilson that always said Get Flannigan Officer Timothy Flannigan Hes
your man

My heart had been going lower and lower So he knew Bella and he knew I
was not Bella although he had not grasped the fact that I was usurping
her place The odious Harbison man sat on the table and swung his feet

I wonder if you know he said looking around him how good it is
to see a white woman so perfectly at home in a civilized kitchen again
after two years of food cooked by a filthy Indian squaw over a portable
sheetiron stove

SO PERFECTLY AT HOME I stood in the middle of the room and stared
around at the copper things hanging up and the rows of blue and white
crockery and the dozens and hundreds of complicatedlooking utensils
whose names I had never even heard and I was dazed I tried with some
show of authority to instruct Flannigan about gathering up the soiled
things and after listening in puzzled silence for a minute he
stripped off his blue coat with a tolerant smile

Lave em to me miss he said The miss passed unnoticed I maynt
give em a Turkish bath which is what you are describin but Ill get
the grease off all right I always clean up while the missus is in bed
with a young un

He rolled up his sleeves found a brown checked gingham apron behind
the door and tied it around his neck with the ease of practice Then
he cleared off the plates eating what appealed to him as he did so and
stopping now and again for a deepthroated chuckle

Im thinkin he said once stopping with a dish in the air what a
deuce of a noise there will be when the vaccination doctor comes around
this mornin In a week every one of us will be nursin a sore arm or
walkin on one leg beggin your pardon miss The last time the force
was vaccinated I asked to be done behind me ear I needed me legs and I
needed me arms but didnt need me head much

He threw his head back and laughed Mr Harbison laughed Oh we were
very cheerful And that awful stove stared at me and the kettle began
to hum and Aunt Selina sent down word that she was not well and would
like some omelet on her tray Omelet

I knew that it was made of eggs but that was the extent of my
knowledge I muttered an excuse and ran upstairs to Anne but she was
still sniffling over her necklace and said she didnt know anything
about omelets and didnt care Food would choke her Neither of the
Mercer girls knew either and Bella who was still reading in the den
absolutely declined to help

I dont know and I wouldnt tell you if I did You can get yourself
out as you got yourself in she said nastily The simplest thing if
you dont mind my suggesting it is to poison the coffee and kill the
lot of us Only if you decide to do it let me know I want to live
just long enough to see Jimmy Wilson WRITHE

Bella is the kind of person who gets on ones nerves She finds a
grievance and hugs it she does ridiculous things and blames other
people And she flirts

I went downstairs despondently and found that Mr Harbison had
discovered some eggs and was standing helplessly staring at them

Omeleteggs Eggsomelet Thats the extent of my knowledge he
said when I entered Youll have to come to my assistance

It was then that I saw the cook book It was lying on a shelf beside the
clock and while Mr Harbison had his back turned I got it down It was
quite clear that the domestic type of woman was his ideal and I did
not care to outrage his belief in me So I took the cook book into the
pantry and read the recipe over three times When I came back I knew it
by heart although I did not understand it

I will tell you how I said with a great deal of dignity and since
you want to help you may make it yourself

He was delighted

Fine he said Suppose you give me the idea first Then well go over
it slowly bit by bit Well make a big fluffy omelet and if the others
arent around well eat it ourselves

Well I said trying to remember exactly you take two eggs

Two he repeated Two eggs for ten people

Dont interrupt me I said irritably Ifif two isnt enough we can
make several omelets one after the other

He looked at me with admiration

Who else but you would have thought of that he remarked Well here
are two eggs What next

Separate them I said easily No I didnt know what it meant I hoped
he would I said it as casually as I could and I did not look at him I
knew he was staring at me puzzled

Separate them he said Why they arent fastened together Then he
laughed Oh yes of course When I looked he had put one at each end
of the table Afraid theyll quarrel I suppose he said Well now
theyre separated

Then beat

First separate then beat he repeated The author of that cook book
must have had a mean disposition Whats next Hang them He looked up
at me with his boyish smile

Separate and beat I repeated If I lost a word of that recipe I was
gone It was like saying the alphabet I had to go to the beginning
every time mentally

Well he reflected you cant beat an egg no matter how cruel you
may be unless you break it first He picked up an egg and looked at
it Separate he reflected Ahthe white from thewhatever you
cooking experts call itthe yellow part

Exactly I exclaimed light breaking on me Of course I KNEW you
would find it out Then back to the recipebeat until well mixed
then fold in the whites

Fold he questioned It looks pretty thin to fold doesnt it
Iupon my word I never heard of folding an egg Are youbut of course
you know Please come and show me how

Just fold them in I said desperately It isnt difficult And
because I was so transparent a fraud and knew he must find me out then
I said something about butter and went into the pantry Thats the
trouble with a lie somebody asks you to tell one as a favor to somebody
else and the first thing you know you are having to tell a thousand
and trying to remember the ones you have told so you wont contradict
yourself and the very person you have tried to help turns on you and
reproaches you for being untruthful I leaned my elbows despondently
on the shelf of the kitchen pantry with the feet of a guard visible
through the high window over my head and waited for Mr Harbison to
come in and demand that I fold a raw egg and discover that I didnt
know anything about cooking and was just as useless as all the others

He came He held the bowl out to me and waved a fork in triumph

I have solved it he said Or rather Flannigan and I have solved
it The mixture awaits the magic touch of the cook

I honestly thought I could do the rest It was only to be put in a pan
and browned and then in the oven three minutes And I did it properly
but for two things I should have greased the pan but this was the
books fault it didnt say and I should have lighted the oven The
latter however was Mr Harbisons fault as much as mine and I had wit
enough to lay it to absentmindedness on the part of both of us

After that Aunt Selina or no Aunt Selina we decided to have boiled
eggs and Mr Harbison knew how to cook them He put them in the
tea kettle and then went to look at the furnace And Officer Timothy
Flannigan ground the coffee and gave his opinion of the board of health
in no stinted terms As for me I burned my fingers and the toast and
felt myself growing hot and cold for I was going to be found out as
soon as Flannigan grasped the situation

Then of course I did the thing that caused me so much trouble later
I put down the toasterat least the Harbison man said it was a
toasterand went over and stood in front of the policeman

I dont suppose you will understandexactly I said butbut if
anything occurs toto make you think I am notthat things are not what
they seem to beI mean what I say they areyou will understand that
it is a joke wont you A joke you know

Yes that was what I said I know it sounds like a raving delirium
but when Max came down and squizzled some bacon as he said and told
Flannigan about the robbery and how whether it was a joke or deadly
earnest somebody in the house had taken Annes pearls that wretched
policeman winked at me solemnly over Maxs shoulder Oh it was awful

And to add to my discomfort the most unpleasant ideas WOULD obtrude
themselves WHAT was Mr Harbison doing on the first floor of the house
that night Ice water he had said But there had been plenty of water
in the studio And he had told me it was the furnace

Mr Harbison came back in a half hour and I remembered the eggs We
fished them out of the tea kettle and they were perfectly hard but we
ate them

The doctor from the board of health came that morning and vaccinated us
There was a great deal of excitement and Aunt Selina was done on the
arm As she did not affect evening clothes this was entirely natural
but later on in the week when the wretched things began to take nobody
dared to limp and Leila made a terrible break by wearing a bandage on
her left arm after telling Aunt Selina that she had been vaccinated on
the right



Chapter VIII CORRESPONDENTS DEPARTMENT

The following letters were found in the house post box after the lifting

FROM THOMAS HARBISON LATE ENGINEER OF BRIDGES PERUVIAN TRUNK LINES
SOUTH AMERICA TO HENRY LLEWELLYN CARE OF UNION NITRATE COMPANY
IQUIQUE CHILI

Dear Old Man

I think I was fully a week trying to drive out of my mind my last
glimpse of you with your sickly grin pretending to be tickled to pieces
that the only white man within two hundred miles of your shack was
going on a holiday You old bluffer I used to hang over the rail of the
steamer on the way up and see you standing as I left you beside the
car with its mule and the Indian driver and behind you a million miles
of souldestroying pampa Never mind Jack I sent yesterday by mail
steamer the cigarettes pipes and tobacco canned goods and poker
chips Put in some magazines too and the collars Dont know about the
tiesguess it wont matter down there

Nothing happened on the trip One of the engines broke down three days
out and I spent all my time below decks for fortyeight hours Chief
engineer raving with DTs Got the engine fixed in record time and
havent got my hands clean yet It was bully

With this I send the papers which will tell you how I happen to be
here and why I have leisure to write you three days after landing If
the situation were not so ridiculous it would be maddening Here I
am off for a holiday and congratulating myself that I am foot free and
heart freeyes my friend heart freehere I am shut in the house
of a man I never saw until last night and wouldnt care if I never
saw again with a lot of people who never heard of me who are almost
equally vague about South America who play as hard at bridge as I ever
worked at building one forgive this wont you The novelty has gone
to my head and who belong to the very class of extravagant
luxuryloving nonproducing parasites isnt that what we called them
that you and I used to revile from our lofty Andean pinnacle

To come down to earth here we are six women and five men including
a policeman not a servant in the house and no one who knows how to do
anything They are really immensely interesting these people they
all know each other very well and it is Jimmy here and Dal
thereDallas Brown who went to India with me you remember my speaking
of himand they are good natured too except at meal times The little
hostess Mrs Wilson took over the cooking and although luncheon was
better than breakfast the food still leaves much to the imagination

I wish you could see this Mrs Wilson Hal You would change a whole lot
of your ideas She is a thoroughbred sure enough and of course some
of her beauty is the result of the exquisite care about which you and
Istill from our Andean pinnacleused to rant But the fact is she is
more than that She has fire and pluck no end If you could have seen
her this morning standing in front of a cold kitchen range determined
to conquer it and had seen the tilt of her chin when I offered to take
over the cookingyou neednt grin I can cook and you know ityou
would understand what I mean It was so clear that she was paralyzed
with fright at the idea of getting breakfast and equally clear that
she meant to do it By the way I have learned that her name was McNair
before she married this wouldbe artist Wilson and that she is a
daughter of the McNair who financed the Callao branch

I have not met the others so intimately There are two sisters named
Mercer inclined to be noisythey are playing roulette in the next
room now One is small and dark almost Hebraic in type named Leila and
called Lollie The other larger very blonde and languishing and with
a decided preference for masculine society even saving the mark
mine Dallas Browns wife good looking smokes cigarettes when I am not
aroundthey all do except Mrs Wilson

Then there is a maiden aunt who is ill today with grippe and
excitement and a Miss Knowles who came for a moment last night to
see Mrs Wilson was caught in the quarantine see papers and after
hiding all night in the basement is sulking all day in her room Her
presence created an excitement out of all proportion to the apparent
cause

From the fact that I have reason to know that my artist host and his
beautiful wife are on bad terms and from the significant glances with
which the announcement of Miss Knowles presence was met the state of
affairs seems rather clear Wilson impresses me as a spineless sort
anyhow and when the lady of the basement shut herself away from the
rest today and I happened on Jimmy as they call him pleading with
her through the door I very nearly kicked him down the stairs Oh yes
Ill keep out right enough it isnt my affair

By the way after the quarantine and with the policeman locked in the
furnace room a pearl necklace and a diamond bracelet were stolen Just
ten of us to divide the suspicion Upon my word Hal its the queerest
situation I ever heard of Which of us did it I make a guess that not
a few of us are fools but which is the knave The worst of it is I am
the only unaccredited member of the household

This is more scandal than I ever wrote in my life Lay it to
circumscribed environment and the lack of twenty miles over the
pampa before breakfast We have all been vaccinated and the officious
gentlemen from the board of health have taken their grins and their
formaldehyde and gone Ye gods how we cough

The Carlton order will go through all right I think Phoned him this
morning If it does old man we will take a month in September and
explore the Mercator property

Do you know Hal I have been thinking lately that you and I stick too
close to the grind Business is right enough but whats the use of
spending ones best years succeeding in everything except the things
that are worth while Ill be thirty sooner than I care to say andoh
well you wont understand Youll sit down there with the Southern
Cross and the rest of the infernal astronomical galaxy looking down on
you and the Indians chanting in the village and you will think I have
grown sentimental I have not You and I down there have been looking at
the world through the reverse end of the glass Its a bully old world
Hal and this is Gods part of it

Burn this letter after you read it I suspect it is covered with germs
Well happy days old man

Yours Tom

PS By the way cant you spare some of the Indian pottery you picked
up at Callao I told Mrs Wilson about it and she was immensely
interested Send it to this address Can you get it to the next
steamerT

FROM ME TO MOTHERMRS THEODORE McNAIR HOTEL HAMILTON BERMUDA

Dearest Mother

I hope you will get this before you read the papers and when you DO
read them you are not to get excited and worried I am as well as can
be and a great deal safer than I ever remember to have been in my life
We are quarantined a lot of us in Jim Wilsons house because his
irreproachable Jap did a very reproachable thingtook smallpox Now
read on before you get excited HIS ROOM HAS BEEN FUMIGATED and we have
been vaccinated I am well and happy I cant be killed in a railway
wreck or smashed when the car skids Unless I drown myself in my bath
or jump through a window positively nothing can happen to me So gather
up all your maternal anxieties and cast them to the Bermuda sharks

Anne Brown is heresee the papers for listand if she can not play
propriety Jimmys Aunt Selina can In fact she doesnt play at it she
works I have telephoned Lizette for some clothesenough for a couple
of weeks although Dallas promises to get us out sooner Now dear do
go ahead and have a nice time and on no account come home You could
only have the carriage to stop in front of the house and wave to me
through a window

Mother I want you to do something for me You know who is down there
andthis is awfully delicate Mumsybut hes a nice boy and I thought
I liked him I guess you know he has been rather attentive Now I
DO like him Mumsy but not the way I thought I did and I want you
tovery gently of courseto discourage him a little You know how
I mean Hes a dear boy but I am so tired of people who dont know
anything but horses and motors

And oh yesdo you remember a girl named Lucille Mellon who was at
school with you in Rome And that she married a man named Harbison
Well her son is here He builds railroads and bridges and things and
he even built himself an automobile down in South America because he
couldnt afford to buy one and burned wood in it Wood Think of it

I wired father in Chicago for fear he would come rushing home The
picture in the paper of the face at the basement window is supposed to
be Mr Harbison but of course it isnt any more like him than mine is
like me

Anne Brown mislaid her pearl collar when she took it off last night
and has fussed herself into a sick headache She declares it was stolen
Some of the people are playing bridge Betty Mercer is doing a cake
walk to the RHAPSODIE HONGROISEJim has no everyday musicand
the telephone is ringing We have received enough flowers for a
funeralsomebody sent Lollie a Gates Ajar only with the gates shut

There are no servantsthink of it Mumsy I wish you had made me learn
to cook Mr Harbison has shown me a littlehe was a soldier in the
Spanish Warbut we girls are a terribly ignorant lot Mumsy about the
real things of life

Now dont worry It is more sport than camping in the Adirondacks and
not nearly so damp

Your loving daughter Katherine

PSSouth America must be wonderful Why cant we put the Gadfly in
commission and take a coasting trip this summer It is a shame to own a
yacht and never use it K

Chapter IX FLANNIGANS FIND

The most charitable thing would be to say nothing about the first day
We were baldly brutalthats the only word for it And Mr Harbison
with his beautiful courtesythe really sincere kindtried to patch up
one quarrel after another and failed He rose superbly to the occasion
and made something that he called a South American goulash for luncheon
although it was too salty and every one was thirsty the rest of the
day

Bella was horrid of course She froze Jim until he said he was going to
sit in the refrigerator and cool the butter She locked herself in the
dressing roomit had been assigned to me but that made no difference
to Bellaand did her nails and took three different baths and refused
to come to the table And of course Jimmy was wild and said she would
starve But I said Very well let her starve Not a tray shall leave
my kitchen It was a comfort to have her shut up there anyhow it
postponed the time when she would come face to face with Flannigan

Aunt Selina got sick that day as I have said I was not so bitter as
the others I did not say that I wished she would die The worst I ever
wished her was that she might be quite ill for some time and yet when
she began to recover she was dreadful to me She said for one thing
that it was the hardboiled eggs and the state of the house that did
it and when I said that the grippe was a germ she retorted that I had
probably brought it to her on my clothing

You remember that Betty had drawn the nurses slip and how pleased she
had been about it She got up early the morning of the first day
and made herself a lawn cap and telephoned out for a white nurses
uniformthat is of course for a white uniform for a nurse She really
looked very fetching and she went around all the morning with a red
cross on her sleeve and a Saint Cecilia expression gathering up bottles
of medicinemost of it flesh reducer which was pathetic and closing
windows for fear of drafts She refused to help with the house work and
looked quite exalted but by afternoon it had palled on her somewhat
and she and Max shook dice

Betty was really pleased when Aunt Selina sent for her She took in a
bottle of cologne to bathe her brow and we all stood outside the door
and listened Betty tiptoed in in her pretty cap and apron and we heard
her cautiously draw down the shades

What are you doing that for Aunt Selina demanded I like the light

Its bad for your poor eyes Bettys tone was exactly the proper
bedside pitch low and sugary

Sweet and low sweet and low wind of the western sea Dal hummed
outside

Put up those window shades Aunt Selinas voice was strong enough
Whats in that bottle

Betty was still mild She swished to the window and raised the shade

Im SO sorry you are ill she said sympathetically This is for your
poor aching head Now close your eyes and lie perfectly still and I
will cool your forehead

Theres nothing the matter with my head Aunt Selina retorted And
I have not lost my faculties I am not a child or a sick cow If thats
perfumery take it out

We heard Betty coming to the door but there was no time to get away
She had dropped her mask for a minute and was biting her lip but when
she saw us she forced a smile

Shes ill poor dear she said If you people will go away I can
bring her around all right In two hours she will eat out of my hand

Eat a piece out of your hand Max scoffed in a whisper

We waited a little longer but it was too painful Aunt Selina demanded
a mustard foot bath and a hot lemonade and her back rubbed with liniment
and some strong black tea And in the intervals she wanted to be read
to out of the prayer book And when we had all gone away there came the
most terrible noise from Aunt Selinas room and every one ran We found
Betty in the hall outside the door crying with her fingers in her ears
and her cap over her eye She said she had been putting the hot water
bottle to Aunt Selinas back and it had been too hot Just then
something hit against the door with a soft thud fell to the floor and
burst for a trickle of hot water came over the sill

She wont let me hold her hand Betty wailed or bathe her brow or
smooth her pillow She thinks of nothing but her stomach or her back
And when I try to make her bed look decent she spits at me like a cat
Everything I do is wrong She spilled the foot bath into her shoes and
blamed me for it

It took the united efforts of all of usexcept Bella who stood back
and smiled nastilyto get Betty back into the sick room again I was
supremely thankful by that time that I had not drawn the nurses slip
With dinner ordered in from one of the clubs and the omelet ten hours
behind me my position did not seem so unbearable But a new development
was coming

While Betty was fussing with Aunt Selina Max led a search of the house
He said the necklace and the bracelet must be hidden somewhere and that
no crevice was too small to neglect

We made a formal search all together except Betty and Aunt Selina
and we found a lot of things in different places that Jim said had been
missing since the year one But no jewelsnothing even suggesting a
jewel was found We had explored the entire house every cupboard
every chest even the insides of the couches and the pockets of Jims
clotheswhich he resented bitterlyand found nothing and I must
say the situation was growing rather strained Some one had taken the
jewels they hadnt walked away

It was Flannigan who suggested the roof and as we had tried every place
else we climbed there Of course we didnt find anything but after all
day in the house with the shutters closed on account of reporters the
air was glorious It was February but quite mild and sunny and we
could look down over Riverside Drive and the Hudson and even recognize
people we knew on horseback and in cars It was a pathetic joy and we
lined up along the parapet and watched the motor boats racing on the
river and tried to feel that we were in the world as well as of it but
it was very hard

Betty had been making tea for Aunt Selina and of course when she heard
us up there she followed tray and all and we drank Aunt Selinas tea
and had the first really nice time of the day Bella had come up too
but she was still standoffish and queer and she stood leaning against a
chimney and staring out over the river After a little Mr Harbison put
down his cup and went over to her and they talked quite confidentially
for a long time I thought it bad taste in Bella under the
circumstances after snubbing Dallas and Max and of course treating Jim
like the dirt under her feet to turn right around and be lovely to Mr
Harbison It was hard for Jim

Max came and sat beside me and Flannigan who had been sent down for
more cups passed tea putting the tray on top of the chimney Jim was
sitting grumpily on the roof with his feet folded under him playing
Canfield in the shadow of the parapet buying the deck out of one pocket
and putting his winnings in the other He was watching Bella too and
she knew it and she strained a point to captivate Mr Harbison Any one
could see that

And that was the picture that came out in the next mornings papers
tea cups cards and all For when some one looked up there were four
newspaper photographers on the roof of the next house and they had the
impertinence to thank us

Flannigan had seen Bella by that time but as he still didnt understand
the situation things were just the same But his manner to me puzzled
me whenever he came near me he winked prodigiously and during all the
search he kept one eye on me and seemed to be amused about something

When the rest had gone down to dress for dinner which was being sent
in thank goodness I still sat on the parapet and watched the darkening
river I felt terribly lonely all at once and sad There wasnt any
one any nearer than father in the West or mother in Bermuda who
really cared a rap whether I sat on that parapet all night or not
or who would be sorry if I leaped to the dirty bricks of the next
dooryardnot that I meant to of course

The lights came out across the river and made purple and yellow streaks
on the water and one of the motor boats came panting back to the yacht
club coughing and gasping as if it had overdone Down on the street
automobiles were starting and stopping cabs rolling doors slamming
all the maddening delightful bustle of people who are footfree to
dine out to dance to go to the theater to do any of the thousand
possibilities of a long February evening And above them I sat on the
roof and cried Yes cried

I was roused by some one coughing just behind me and I tried to
straighten my face before I turned It was Flannigan his double row of
brass buttons gleaming in the twilight

Excuse me miss he said affably but the boy from the hotel has left
the dinner on the doorstep and run the cowardly little divil Whatll
I do with it I went to Mrs Wilson but she says its no concern of
hers Flannigan was evidently bewildered

Youd better keep it warm Flannigan I replied You neednt wait
Im coming But he did not go

Ifif youll excuse me miss he said dont you think yed betther
tell them

Tell them what

The whole thingthe joke he said confidentially coming closer
Its been great sport now hasnt it But Im afraid they will get on
to it soon andsome of them might not be agreeable A pearl necklace
is a pearl necklace miss and the ladys wild

What do you mean I gasped You dont thinkwhy Flannigan

He merely grinned at me and thrust his hand down in his pocket When
he brought it up he had Bellas bracelet on his palm glittering in the
faint light

Where did you get it Between relief and the absurdity of the thing
I was almost hysterical But Flannigan did not give me the bracelet
instead it struck me his tone was suddenly severe

Now look here miss he said youve played your trick and youve
had your fun The Lord knows its only folks like you would play April
fool jokes with a fortune If youre the sinsible little woman you look
to be youll put that pearl collar on the coal in the basement tonight
and let me find it

I havent got the pearl collar I protested I think you are crazy
Where did you get that bracelet

He edged away from me as if he expected me to snatch it from him and
run but he was still trying in an elephantine way to treat the matter
as a joke

I found it in a drawer in the pantry he said among the dirty linen
And if youre as smart as I think you are Ill find the pearl collar
there in the morningand nothing said miss

So there I was suspected of being responsible for Annes pearl collar
as if I had not enough to worry me before Of course I could have called
them all together and told them and made them explain to Flannigan what
I had really meant by my delirious speech in the kitchen But that
would have meant telling the whole ridiculous story to Mr Harbison and
having him think us all mad and me a fool

In all that overcrowded house there was only one place where I could be
miserable with comfort So I stayed on the roof and cried a little
and then became angry and walked up and down and clenched my hands
and babbled helplessly The boats on the river were yellow horizontal
streaks through my tears and an early searchlight sent its shaft like
a tangible thing in the darkness just over my head Then finally
I curled down in a corner with my arms on the parapet and the lights
became more and more prismatic and finally formed themselves into a
circle that was Bellas bracelet and that kept whirling around and
around on something flat and not overclean that was Flannigans palm



Chapter X ON THE STAIRS

I was roused by someone walking across the roof the cracking of tin
under feet and a comfortable and companionable odor of tobacco I
moved a very little and then I saw that it was a manthe height and
erectness told me which man And just at that instant he saw me

Good Lord he ejaculated and throwing his cigar away he came across
quickly Why Mrs Wilson what in the world are you doing here I
thoughtthey said

That I was sulking again I finished disagreeably Perhaps I am In
fact Im quite sure of it

You are not he said severely You have been asleep in a February
night in the open air with less clothing on than I wear in the
tropics

I had got up by this time refusing his help and because my feet were
numb I sat down on the parapet for a moment Oh I knew what I looked
likeone of those ValleyoftheNileAfteraFlood pictures

There is one thing about you that is comforting I sniffed You said
precisely the same thing to me at three oclock this morning You never
startle me by saying anything unexpected

He took a step toward me and even in the dusk I could see that he was
looking down at me oddly All my bravado faded away and there was a
queerish ringing in my ears

I would like to he said tensely I would like this minuteIm
a fool Mrs Wilson he finished miserably I ought to be drawn and
quartered but when I see you like this II get crazy If you say the
word IllIll go down and He clenched his fist

It was reprehensible of course he saw that in an instant for he shut
his teeth over something that sounded very fierce and strode away from
me to stand looking out over the river with his hands thrust in his
pockets Of course the thing I should have done was to ignore what he
had said altogether but he was so uncomfortable so chastened that
feline feminine whatever the instinct is I could not let him go I
had been so wretched myself

What is it you would like to say I called over to him He did not
speak Would you tell me that I am a silly child for pouting No
reply he struck a match Or would you preach a nice little sermon
about peopleabout womenloving their husbands

He grunted savagely under his breath

Be quite honest I pursued relentlessly Say that we are a lot
of barbarians say that because mybecause Jimmy treats me
outrageouslyoh he does any one can see thatand because I loathe
himand any one can tell thatwhy dont you say you are shocked to
the depths I was a little shocked myself by that time but I couldnt
stop having started

He came over to me whitefaced and towering and he had the audacity
to grip my arm and stand me on my feet like a bad childwhich I was I
dare say

Dont he said in a husky very pained voice You are only talking
you dont mean it It isnt YOU You know you care or else why are you
crying up here And dont do it again DONT DO IT AGAINor I will

You willwhat

Make a fool of myself as I have now he finished grimly And then he
stalked away and left me there alone completely bewildered to find my
way down in the dark

I groped along holding to the rail for the staircase to the roof was
very steep and I went slowly Halfway down the stairs there was a
tiny landing and I stopped I could have sworn I heard Mr Harbisons
footsteps far below growing fainter I even smiled a little there in
the dark although I had been rather profoundly shaken The next instant
I knew I had been wrong some one was on the landing with me I could
hear short sharp breathing and then

I am not sure that I struggled in fact I dont believe I didI was
too limp with amazement The creature to have lain in wait for me like
that And he was brutally strong he caught me to him fiercely and held
me there close and he kissed menot once or twice but half a dozen
times long kisses that filled me with hot shame for him for myself
that I hadliked him The roughness of his coat bruised my cheek I
loathed him And then someone came whistling along the hall below and
he pushed me from him and stood listening breathing in long gasping
breaths

I ran when my shaky knees would hold me I ran I wanted to hide my hot
face my disgust my disillusion I wanted to put my head in mothers
lap and cry I wanted to die or be ill so I need never see him again
Perversely enough I did none of those things With my face still
flaming with burning eyes and hands that shook I made a belated
evening toilet and went slowly haughtily down the stairs My hands
were like ice but I was consumed with rage Oh I would show himthat
this was New York not Iquique that the roof was not his Andean
tableland

Every one elaborately ignored my absence from dinner The Dallas Browns
Max and Lollie were at bridge Jim was alone in the den walking the
floor and biting at an unlighted cigar Betty had returned to Aunt
Selina and was hysterical they said and Flannigan was in deep
dejection because I had missed my dinner

Betty is making no end of a row Max said looking up from his game
because the old lady upstairs insists on chloroform liniment Betty
says the smell makes her ill

And she can inhale Russian cigarettes Anne said enviously and
gasolene fumes without turning a hair I call a revoke Dal you
trumped spades on the second round

Dal flung over three tricks with very bad grace and Anne counted them
with maddening deliberation

Game and rubber she said Watch Dal Max he will cheat in the score
if he can Kit dont have another clam while I am in this house I have
eaten so many lately my waist rises and falls with the tide

You have a stunning color Kit Lollie said You are really quite
superb Who made that gown

Where have you been hiding du kleine Max whispered under cover of
showing me the evening paper with a photograph of the house and a cross
at the cellar window where we had tried to escape If one day in the
house with you Kit puts me in this condition what will a month do

From beyond the curtain of a sort of alcove lighted with a redshaded
lamp came a hum of conversation Bellas cool even tones and a heavy
masculine voice They were laughing I could feel my chin go up He was
not even hiding his shame

Max I asked while the others clamored for him and the game has any
one been up through the house since dinner Any of the men

He looked at me curiously

Only Harbison he replied promptly Jim has been eating his heart
out in the den every since dinner Dal played the Sonata Appasionata
backward on the pianolahe wanted to put through one of Annes lingerie
waists on a wager that it would play a tune I played craps with
Lollie and Flannigan has been washing dishes Why

Well that was conclusive anyhow I had had a faint hope that it might
have been a joke although it had borne all the evidences of sincerity
certainly But it was past doubting now he had lain in wait for me at
the landing and had kissed me ME when he thought I was Jimmys wife
Oh I must have been very light very contemptible if that was what he
thought of me

I went into the library and got a book but it was impossible to read
with Jimmy lying on the couch giving vent to something between a sigh
and a groan every few minutes About eleven the cards stopped and Bella
said she would read palms She began with Mr Harbison because she
declared he had a wonderful hand full of possibilities she said he
should have been a great inventor or a playwright and that his attitude
to women was one of homage respect almost reverence He had the
courage to look at me and if a glance could have killed he would have
withered away

When Jimmy proffered his hand she looked at it icily Of course she
could not refuse with Mr Harbison looking on

Rather negative she said coldly The lines are obscured by cushions
of flesh no heart line at all mentality small selfindulgence and
irritability very marked

Jim held his palm up to the light and stared at it

Gad he said Hardly safe for me to go around without gloves is it

It was all well enough for Jim to laugh but he was horribly hurt He
stood around for a few minutes talking to Anne but as soon as he could
he slid away and went to bed He looked very badly the next morning
as though he had not slept and his clothes quite hung on him He was
actually thinner But that is ahead of the story

Max came to me while the others were sitting around drinking nightcaps
and asked me in a low tone if he could see me in the den he wanted to
ask me something Dal overheard

Ask her here he said We all know what it is Max Go ahead and
well coach you

Will you coach ME I asked for Mr Harbison was listening

The woman does not need it Dal retorted And then because Max looked
angry enough really to propose to me right there I got up hastily and
went into the den Max followed and closing the door stood with his
back against it

Contrary to the general belief Kit he began I did NOT intend to
ask you to marry me

I breathed easier He took a couple of steps toward me and stood with
his arms folded looking down at me Im not at all sure in fact that
I shall ever propose to you he went on unpleasantly

You have already done it twice You are not going to take those back
are you Max I asked looking up at him

But Max was not to be cajoled He came close and stood with his hand on
the back of my chair What happened on the roof tonight He demanded
hoarsely

I do not think it would interest you I retorted coloring in spite of
myself

Not interest me I am shut in this blasted house I have to see the
only woman I ever lovedREALLY loved he supplemented as he caught my
eye pretend she is another mans wife Then I sit back and watch her
using every artall her beautyto make still another man love her
a man who thinks she is a married woman If Harbison were worth the
trouble I would tell him the whole story Aunt Selina beobliterated

I sat up suddenly

If Harbison were worth the trouble I repeated What did he mean Had
he seen

I mean just this Max said slowly There is only one unaccredited
member of this household only one person save Flannigan who was
locked in the furnace room one person who was awake and around the
house when Annes jewels went only one person in the house also who
would have any motive for the theft

Motive I asked dully

Poverty Max threw at me Oh I mean comparative poverty of course
Who is this fellow anyhow Dal knew him at school traveled with him
through India On the strength of that he brings him here quarters him
with decent people and wonders when they are systematically robbed

You are unjust I said rising and facing him I do not like Mr
HarbisonII hate him if you want to know But as to his being a
thief Ithink it is quite as likely that you took the necklace

Max threw his cigarette into the fire angrily

So that is how it is he mocked If either of us is the thief it is
I You DO hate him dont you

I left him there flushed with irritation and joined the others Just
as I entered the room Betty burst through the hall door like a cyclone
and collapsed into a chair Shes a mean cantankerous old woman she
declared feeling for her handkerchief You can take care of your own
Aunt Selina Jim Wilson I will never go near her again

What did you do Poison her Dallas asked with interest

Ggot camphor in her eyes snuffed Betty You neverheard such a
noise I wouldnt be a trained nurse for anything in the world Sheshe
called me a hussy

Youre not going to give her up are you Betty Jim asked
imploringly But Betty was and said so plainly

Anyhow she wont have me back she finished and she has sent
forguess

Have mercy Dal cried dropping to his knees Oh fair ministering
angel she has not sent for me

No Betty said maliciously She wants Bellashes crazy about her



Chapter XI I MAKE A DISCOVERY

Really I have left Aunt Selina rather out of it but she was important
as a cause not as a result at least at first She came out strong
later I believe she was a very nice old woman with strong likes and
prejudices which she was perfectly willing to pay for At least I only
presume she had likes I know she had prejudices

Nobody every understood why Bella consented to take Bettys place with
Aunt Selina As for me I was too much engrossed with my own affairs
to pay the invalid much attention Once or twice during the day I had
stopped in to see her and had been received frigidly and with marked
disapproval I was in disgrace of course after the scene in the dining
room the night before I had stood like a naughty child just inside the
door and replied meekly when she said the pillows were overstuffed and
why didnt I have the linen slips rinsed in starch water She laid the
blame of her illness on me as I have said before and she made Jim read
to her in the afternoon from a book she carried with her Coals of Fire
on the DOMESTIC Hearth marking places for me to read

She sent for me that night just as I had taken off my gown so I threw
on a dressing gown and went in To my horror Jim was already there At
a gesture from Aunt Selina he closed the door into the hall and tiptoed
back beside the bed where he sat staring at the figures on the silk
comfort

Aunt Selinas first words were

Wheres that flibbertygibbet

Jim looked at me

She must mean Betty I explained She has gone to bed I think

Dontletherinthisroomagain she said with awful emphasis
She is an infamous creature

Oh come now Aunt Selina Jim broke in shes foolish perhaps but
shes a nice little thing

Aunt Selinas face was a curious study Then she raised herself on her
elbow and taking a flat chamoisskin bag from under her pillow held
it out

My cameo breastpin she said solemnly my cuffbuttons with gold rims
and storks painted on china in the middle my watch that has put me to
bed and got me up for forty years and my moneyfive hundred and ten
dollars and forty centstaken with the doors locked under my nose
Which was ambiguous but forcible

But good gracious Miss CarAunt Selina I exclaimed you dont
think Betty Mercer took those things

No she said grimly I think I probably got up in my sleep and
lighted the fire with them or sent em out for a walk Then she stuffed
the bag away and sat up resolutely in bed

Have you made up she demanded looking from one to the other of us
Bella dont tell me you still persist in that nonsense

What nonsense I asked getting ready to run

That you do not love him

Him

James she snapped irritably Do you suppose I mean the policeman

I looked over at Jimmy She had got me by the hand and Jimmy was making
frantic gestures to tell her the whole thing and be done with it But
I had gone too far The mill of the gods had crushed me already and
I didnt propose to be drawn out hideously mangled and held up as an
example for the next two or three weeks although it was clear enough
that Aunt Selina disapproved of me thoroughly and would have been glad
enough to find that no tie save the board of health held us together
And then Bella came in and you wouldnt have known her She had put on
a straight white woolen wrapper and she had her hair in two long braids
down her back She looked like a nice wideeyed little girl in her
teens and she had some lobster salad and a glass of port on a tray
When she saw the situation she put the things down and had the
nastiness to stay and listen

Im not blind Aunt Selina said with one eye on the tray You two
silly children adore each other I saw some things last night

Bella took a step forward then she stopped and shrugged her shoulders
Jim was purple

I saw you kiss her in the dining room remember that Aunt Selina went
on giving the screw another turn

It was Bellas turn to be excited She gave me one awful stare then she
fixed her eyes on Jim

Besides Aunt Selina went on you told me today that you loved her
Dont deny it James

Bella couldnt keep quiet another instant She came over and stood at
the foot of the bed

Please dont excite yourself DEAR Miss Caruthers she said in a voice
like ice Every one knows that he loves her he simply overflows
with it Itit is quite a byword among their friends They have been
sitting together in a corner all evening

Yes that was what she said when I had not spoken to Jimmy the whole
time in the den Bella was cattish and she was jealous too I turned
on my heel and went to the door then I turned to her with my hand on
the knob

You have been misinformed I said coldly You can not possibly know
having spent three hours in a corner yourselfwith Mr Harbison I
abhor jealousy in a woman

Well Aunt Selina ate all the lobster salad and drank the port after
Bella had told her it was beef iron and wine and she slept all night
and was able to sit up in a chair the next day and was so infatuated
with Bella that she would not let her out of her sight But that is
ahead of the story

At midnight the house was fairly quiet except for Jim who kept walking
around the halls because he couldnt sleep I got up at last and ordered
him to bed and he had the audacity to have a grievance with me

Look at my situation now he said sitting pensively on a steam
radiator Aunt Selina is crazy I only kissed your hand anyhow and I
dont know why you sat in the den all evening you might have known that
Bella would notice it Why couldnt you leave me alone to my misery

Very well I said much offended After this I shall sit with
Flannigan in the kitchen He is the only gentleman in the house

I left him babbling apologies and went to bed but I had an
uncomfortable feeling that Bella had been a witness to our conversation
for the door into Aunt Selinas room closed softly as I passed

I knew beforehand that I was not going to sleep The instant I turned
out the light the nightmare events of the evening ranged themselves in
a procession or a series of tableaus one after the other Flannigan on
the roof with the bracelet on his palm looking accusingly at me Mr
Harbison and the scene on the roof with my flippancy and the result
of that flippancythe man on the stairs the arms that held me the
terrible kisses that had scorched my lipsit was awful And then the
absurd situation across Aunt Selinas bed and Bellas face Oh it
was all so ridiculousmy having thought that the Harbison man was
a gentleman and finding him a cad and worse It was excruciatingly
funny I quite got a headache from laughing indeed I laughed until I
found I was crying and then I knew I was going to have an attack of
strangulated emotion called hysteria So I got up and turned on all the
lights and bathed my face with cologne and felt better

But I did not go to sleep When the hall clock chimed two I discovered
I was hungry I had had nothing since luncheon and even the thirst
following the South American goulash was gone There was probably
something to eat in the pantry and if there was not I was quite equal
to going to the basement

As it happened however I found a very orderly assortment of leftovers
and a pitcher of milk which had no business there in the pantry and
with plenty of light I was not at all frightened

I ate bread and butter and drank milk and was fast becoming a rational
person again I had pulled out one of the drawers part way and with a
tray across the corner I had improvised a comfortable seat And then I
noticed that the drawer was full of soiled napkins and I remembered the
bracelet I hardly know why I decided to go through the drawer again
after Flannigan had already done it but I did I finished my milk and
then getting down on my knees I proceeded systematically to empty the
drawer I took out perhaps a dozen napkins and as many doilies without
finding anything Then I took out a large tray cloth and there was
something on it that made me look farther One corner of it had been
scorched the clear and well defined imprint of a lighted cigarette or
cigar a blackened streak that trailed off into a brown and yellow
I had a queer trembly feeling as if I were on the brink of a
discoveryperhaps Annes pearls or the cuff buttons with storks
painted on china in the center But the only thing I found down in the
corner of the drawer was a halfburned cigarette

To me it seemed quite enough It was one of the South American
cigarettes with a tobacco wrapper instead of paper that Mr Harbison
smoked



Chapter XII THE ROOF GARDEN

I was quite ill the next morningfrom excitement I suppose Anyhow
I did not get up and there wasnt any breakfast Jim said he roused
Flannigan at eight oclock to go down and get the fire started and
then went back to bed But Flannigan did not get up He appeared
sheepishly at halfpast ten and by that time Bella was down in a
towering rage and had burned her hand and got the fire started and had
taken up a tray for Aunt Selina and herself

As the others straggled down they boiled themselves eggs or ate fruit
and nobody put anything away Lollie Mercer made me some tea and
scorched toast and brought it about eleven oclock

I never saw such a house she declared A dozen housemaids couldnt
put it in order Why should every man that smokes drop ashes wherever he
happens to be

Thats the question of the ages I replied languidly What was
Max talking so horribly about a little while ago Lollie looked up
aggrieved

About nothing at all she declared Anne told me to clean the bath
tubs with oil and I did it thats all Now Max says he couldnt get it
off and his clothes stick to him and if he should forget and strike a
match in thein the usual way he would explode He can clean his own
tub tomorrow she finished vindictively

At noon Jim came in to see me bringing Anne as a concession to Bella
He was in a rage and he carried the morning paper like a club in his
hand

What sort of a newspaper lie would you call this he demanded
irritably It makes me crazy everybody with a mental image of me
leaning over the parapet of the roof waving a board with the rest of
you sitting on my legs to keep me from overbalancing

Maybe theres a picture Anne said hopefully

Jim looked

No picture he announced I wonder why they restrained themselves
I wish Bella would keep off the roof he added with fresh access
of rage or wear a mask or veil One of those fellows is going to
recognize her and therell be the deuce to pay

When you are all through discussing this thing perhaps you will tell
me what is the matter I remarked from my couch Why did you lean over
the parapet Jim and who sat on your legs

I didnt nobody did he retorted waving the newspaper Its a
lie out of the whole cloth thats what it is I asked you girls to
be decent to those reporters it never pays to offend a newspaper man
Listen to this Kit

He read the article rapidly furiously pausing every now and then to
make an exasperated comment

ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE FRUSTRATED MEMBERS OF THE FOUR HUNDRED DEFY THE LAW

Special Officer McCloud on duty at the quarantined house of James
Wilson artist and clubman on Ninetyfifth Street reported this
morning a daring attempt at escape made at 3 AM It is in this house
that some eight or nine members of the smart set were imprisoned
during the course of a dinner party when the Japanese butler developed
smallpox The party shut in the house includes Miss Katherine McNair
the daughter of Theodore McNair of the InterOcean system Mr and Mrs
Dallas Brown the Misses Mercer Maxwell Reed the wellknown clubman
and whip and a Mr Thomas Harbison guest of the Dallas Browns and a
South American

Officer McClouds story told to a Chronicle reporter this morning is
as follows The occupants of the house had been uneasy all day From the
air of subdued bustle and from a careful inspection of the roof
made by the entire party during the afternoon his suspicion had been
aroused Nothing unusual however occurred during the early part of the
night From eight oclock to twelve McCloud was relieved from duty his
place being taken by Michael Shane of the Eightysixth Street Station

When McCloud came on duty at midnight Shane reported that about eleven
oclock the searchlight of a steamer on the river flashing over the
house had shown a man crouching on the parapet evidently surveying
the roof across which at this point is only twelve feet distant with a
view of making his escape One seeing Shane below however he had beat
a retreat but not before the officer had seen him distinctly He was
dressed in evening clothes and wore a light tan overcoat

Officer McCloud relieved Shane at midnight and sent for a
plainclothes man from the station house This man was stationed on the
roof of the Bevington residence next door with strict injunctions
to prevent an escape from the quarantined mansion Nothing suspicious
having occurred the man on the roof left about 3 AM reporting
to McCloud below that everything was quiet At that moment glancing
skyward one of the officers was astounded to see a long narrow board
project itself from the coping of the Wildon house waver uncertainly
for a moment and then advance stealthily toward the parapet across
When it was within a foot or two of a resting place McCloud called
sharply to the invisible refugee above at the same time firing his
revolver in the ground

The result was surprising The board stopped trembled swayed a
little and dropped missing the vigilant officers by a hairs breadth
and crashing to the cement with a terrific force An inspection of the
roof from the Bevington house later revealed nothing unusual It
is evident however that the quarantine is proving irksome to the
inhabitants of the sequestered residence most of whom are typical
society folk without resources in themselves Their condition without
valets and maids is certainly pitiable It has been rumored that
the ladies are doing their own hair and that the gentlemen have been
reduced to putting their own buttons in their shirts This deplorable
situation however is unavoidable

The vigilance of the board of health has been most commendable in this
case Beginning with a wager over the telephone that they would break
quarantine in twentyfour hours and ending with the attempt to span
a twelvefoot gulf with a board over which to cross to freedom these
shutin society folk have shown characteristic disregard of the laws
of the state It is quite time to extend to the millionaire the same
strictness that keeps the commuter at home for three weeks with the
measles that makes him get the milk bottles and groceries from the
gate post and smell like dog soap for a month afterward as a result of
disinfection

We sat in dead silence for a minute Then

Perhaps it is true I said Not of you Jimbut some one may have
tried to get out that way In fact I think it extremely likely

Who Flannigan You couldnt drive him out Hes having the time of his
life Do you suspect me

Come away and dont fight Anne broke in pacifically You will have
to have luncheon sent in Jimmy nobody has ordered anything from the
shops and I feel like old Mother Hubbard

I wish you would all go out I said wearily If every man in the
house says he didnt try to get over to the next roof last night well
and good But you might look and see if the board is still lying where
it fell

There was an instantaneous rush for the window and a seconds pause
Then Jimmys voice incredulous awed

Well Ill beblessed Theres the board

I stayed in my room all that day My head really ached and then too
I did not care to meet Mr Harbison It would have to come I realized
that a meeting was inevitable but I wanted time to think how I would
meet him It would be impossible to cut him without rousing the
curiosity of the others to fever pitch and it was equally impossible to
ignore the disgraceful episode on the stairs As it happened however I
need not have worried I went down to dinner languidly when every
one was seated and found Max at my right and Mr Harbison moved over
beside Bella Every one was talking at once for Flannigan ambling
around the table as airily as he walked his beat had presented Bella
with her bracelet on a salad plate garnished with romaine He had found
it in the furnace room he said where she must have dropped it And he
looked at me stealthily to approve his mendacity

Every one was famished and as they ate they discussed the board in the
area way and pretended to deride it as a clever bit of press work to
revive a dying sensation No one was deceived Annes pearls and the
attempt to escape coming just after pointed only to one thing I
looked around the table dazed Flannigan almost the only unknown
quantity might have tried to escape the night before but he would not
have been in dress clothes Besides he must be eliminated as far as the
pearls were concerned having been locked in the furnace room the night
they were stolen There was no one among the girls to suspect The
Mercer girls had stunning pearls and could secure all they wanted
legitimately and Bella disliked them Oh there was no question about
it I decided Dallas and Anne had taken a wolf to their bosomor is
it a viperand the Harbison man was the creature Although I must say
that looking over the table at Jimmys breadth and not very imposing
personality at Maxs lean length sallow skin and bold dark eyes at
Dallas blond growing bald and florid and then at the Harbison boy
tall muscular cleareyed and sunburned one would have taken Max at
first choice as the villain with Dal next Jim third and the Harbison
boy not in the running

It was just after dinner that the surprise was sprung on me Mr
Harbison came around to me gravely and asked me if I felt able to go
up on the roof On the roof after last night I had to gather myself
together luckily the others were pushing back their chairs showing
Flannigan the liqueur glasses to take up and lighting cigars

I do not care to go I said icily

The others are coming he persisted and II could give you an arm
up the stairs

I believe you are good at that I said looking at him steadily Max
will you help me to the roof

Mr Harbison really turned rather white Then he bowed ceremoniously and
left me

Max got me a wrap and every one except Mr Harbison and Bella who was
taking a mass of indigestables to Aunt Selina went to the roof

Where is Tom Anne asked as we reached the foot of the stairs Gone
ahead to fix things was the answer But he was not there At the top
of the last flight I stopped dumb with amazement the roof had been
transformed enchanted It was a fairyland of lights and foliage and
colors I had to stop and rub my eyes From the bleakness of a tin roof
in February to the brightness and greenery of a July roof garden

You were the immediate inspiration Kit Dallas said Harbison
thought your headache might come from lack of exercise and fresh air
and he has worked us like nailers all day Ive a blister on my right
palm and Harbison got shocked while he was wiring the place and
nearly fell over the parapet We bought out two fullsized florists by
telephone

It was the most amazing transformation At each corner a pole had been
erected and wires crossed the roof diagonally hung with red and amber
bulbs Around the chimneys had been massed evergreen trees in tubs
hiding their brickandmortar ugliness and among the trees tiny lights
were strung Along the parapet were rows of geometrical boxwood plants
in bright red crocks and the flaps of a crimson and white tent had
been thrown open showing lights within and rugs wicker chairs and
cushions

Max raised a glass of benedictine and posed for a moment
melodramatically

To the Wilson roof garden he said To Kit who inspired to the
creators who perspired and to Takahiromay he not have expired

Every one was very gay I think the knowledge that tomorrow Aunt Selina
might be with them urged them to make the most of this last night of
freedom I tried to be jolly and succeeded in being feverish Mr
Harbison did not come up to enjoy what he had wrought Jim brought up
his guitar and sang love songs in a beautiful tenor looking at Bella
all the time And Bella sat in a steamer chair with a rug over her and
a spangled veil on her head looking at the boats on the riverabout as
soft and as chastened as an an acetylene headlight

And after Max had told the most improbable tale which Leila advised him
to sprinkle salt on and Dallas had done a clog dance Bella said it
was time for her complexion sleep and went downstairs and broke up the
party

If she only give half as an much care to her immortal soul Anne said
when she had gone as she does to her skin she would let that nice
Harbison boy alone She must have been brutal to him tonight for he
went to bed at nine oclock At least I suppose he went to bed for he
shut himself in the studio and when I knocked he advised me not to come
in

I had pleaded my headache as an excuse for avoiding Aunt Selina all day
and she had not sent for me Bella was really quite extraordinary
She was never in the habit of putting herself out for any one and she
always declared that the very odor of a sick room drove her to Scotch
and soda But here she was rubbing Aunt Selinas back with chloroform
linimentand you know how that smellsgetting her up in a chair
dressed in one of Bellas wadded silk robes with pillows under her
feet and then doing her hair in elaborate puffsbraiding her gray
switch and bringing it coronetfashion around the top of her head
She even put rice powder on Aunt Selinas nose and dabbed violet water
behind her ears and said she couldnt understand why she Aunt Selina
had never married but of course she probably would some day

The result was naturally that the old lady wouldnt let Bella out of
her sight except to go to the kitchen for something to eat for her
That very day Bella got the doctor to order ale for Aunt Selina oh
yes the doctor could come in Dal said it was all acoming in and
nothing going out and she had three pints of Bass and learned to eat
anchovies and caviareall in one day

Bellas conduct to Jim was disgraceful She snubbed him ignored him
tramped on him and Jim was growing positively flabby He spent most of
his time writing letters to the board of health and playing solitaire
He was a pathetic figure

Well we went to bed fairly early Bella had massaged Aunt Selinas
face and rubbed in cold cream Anne and Dallas had compromised on which
window should be open in their bedroom and the men had matched to see
who should look at the furnace I did not expect to sleep but the cold
night air had done its work and I was asleep almost immediately

Some time during the early part of the night I wakened and after
turning and twisting uneasily I realized that I was cold The couch
in Bellas dressing room was comfortable enough but narrow and low I
remember distinctly that was what was so maddening everybody thought I
dreamed itI remember getting an eiderdown comfort that was folded
at my feet and pulling it up around me In the luxury of its warmth I
snuggled down and went to sleep almost instantly It seemed to me I had
slept for hours but it was probably an hour or less when something
roused me The room was perfectly dark and there was not a sound save
the faint ticking of the clock but I was wide awake

And then came the incident that in its ghastly horrible absurdity made
the rest of the people shout with laughter the next day It was not
funny then For suddenly the eiderdown comfort began to slip I heard no
footstep not the slightest sound approaching me but the comfort
moved from my chin inch by inch it slipped to my shoulders awfully
inevitably hairraisingly it moved I could feel my blood gather around
my heart leaving me cold and nerveless As it passed my hands I gave
an involuntary clutch for it to feel it slip away from my fingers Then
the full horror of the situation took hold of me as the comfort slid
past my feet I sat up and screamed at the top of my voice

Of course people came running in all sorts of things I was still
sitting up declaring I had seen a ghost and that the house was haunted
Dallas was struggling for the second armhole of his dressing gown and
Bella had already turned on the lights They said I had had a nightmare
and not to sleep on my back and perhaps I was taking grippe

And just then we heard Jimmy run down the stairs and fall over
something almost breaking his wrist It was the eiderdown comfort
halfway up the studio staircase



Chapter XIII HE DOES NOT DENY IT

Aunt Selina got up the next morning and Jim told her all the strange
things that had been happening She fixed on Flannigan of course
although she still suspected Betty of her watch and other valuables The
incident of the comfort she called nervous indigestion and bad hours

She spent the entire day going through the storeroom and linen closets
and running her fingers over things for dust Whenever she found any
she looked at me drew a long breath and said Poor James It was
maddening And when she went through his clothes and found some buttons
off Jim didnt keep a man and Takahiro had stopped at his boots she
looked at me quite awfully

His mother was a perfect housekeeper she said James was brought up
in clothes with the buttons on put on clean shelves

Didnt they put them on him I asked almost hysterically It had been
a bad morning after a worse night Every one had found fault with the
breakfast and they straggled down one at a time until I was frantic
Then Flannigan had talked to me about the pearls and Mr Harbison had
said Good morning very stiffly and nearly rattled the inside of the
furnace out

Early in the morning too I overheard a scrap of conversation between
the policeman and our gentleman adventurer from South America Something
had gone wrong with the telephone and Mr Harbison was fussing over it
with a screw driver and a pair of scissorsall the tools he could find
Flannigan was lifting rugs to shake them on the roofBellas order

Wash the table linen he was grumbling Ill do what I can thats
necessary Grub has to be cooked and dishes has to be washedIll
admit that If youre particular make up your bed every day I dont
object But dont tell me we have to use thirtythree table napkins
a day What did folks do before napkins was invented Tell me
thattriumphantly

Whats the answer Mr Harbison inquired absently evidently with the
screw driver in his mouth

Used their pocket handkerchiefs And if the worst comes to the
worst Mr Harbison these folks here can use their sleeves for all
I carenot that the women has any sleeves to speak of Wash clothes I
will not

Well dont worry Mrs Wilson about it the other voice said
Flannigan straightened himself with a grunt

Mrs Wilson he said A lot she would worry Shes been a
disappointment to me Mr Harbison me thinking that now shed come back
to him after leavin him the way she did theyd be like two turtle
doves Lord The cook next door

But what the cook had told about Bella and Jimmy was not divulged
for the Harbison man caught him up with a jerk and sent Flannigan
grumbling with his rugs to the roof

It did not seem possible to carry on the deception much longer but if
things were bad now what would they be when Aunt Selina learned she had
been lied to made ridiculous generally deceived And how would I be
able to live in the house with her when she did know Luckily every
one was so puzzled over the mystery in the house that numbers of little
things that would have been absolutely damning were never noticed at
all For instance my asking Jimmy at luncheon that day if he took cream
in his coffee And Max coming to the rescue by dropping his watch in
his glass of water and creating a diversion and giving everybody an
opportunity to laugh by saying not to mind it had been in soak before

Just after luncheon Aunt Selina brought me some undergarments of Jims
to be patched She explained at length that he had always worn out his
undergarments because he always squirmed around so when he was sitting
And she showed me how to lay one of the garments over a pillow to get
the patch in properly

It was the most humiliating moment of my life but there was no escape
I took my sewing to the roof while she went away to find something else
for me to do when that was finished and I sat with the thing on my
knee and stared at it while rebellious tears rolled down my cheeks
The patch was not the shape of the hole at all and every time I took a
stitch I sewed it fast to the pillow beneath It was terrible Jim came
up after a while and sat down across from me and watched without saying
anything I suppose what he felt would not have been proper to say to
me We had both reached the point where adequate language failed us
Finally he said

I wish I were dead

So do I I retorted jerking the thread

Where is she now

Looking for more of these I indicated the garment over the pillow
and he wiggled Please dont squirm I said coldly You will wear out
yourlingerie and I will have to mend them

He sat very still for five minutes when I discovered that I had put the
patch in crosswise instead of lengthwise and that it would not fit As I
jerked it out he sneezed

Or sneeze I added venomously You will tear your buttons off and I
will have to sew them on

Jim rose wrathfully Dont sit dont sneeze he repeated Dont
stand I suppose for fear I will wear out my socks Here give me that
If the fool thing has to be mended Ill do it myself

He went over to a corner of the parapet and turned his back to me He
was very much offended In about a minute he came back triumphant and
held out the result of his labor I could only gasp He had puckered up
the edges of the hole like the neck of a bag and had tied the thread
around it Youyou wont be able to sit down I ventured

Dont have any time to sit he retorted promptly Anyhow it will
give some wont it It would if it was tied with elastic instead of
thread Have you any elastic

Lollie came up just then and Jim took himself and his mending
downstairs Luckily Aunt Selina found several letters in his room that
afternoon while she was going over his clothes and as it took Jim some
time to explain them she forgot the task she had given me altogether

When Lollie came up to the roof she closed the door to the stairs and
coming over drew a chair close to mine

Have you seen much of Tom today she asked as an introduction

I suppose you mean Mr Harbison Lollie I said Nonot any more
than I could help Dont whisper he couldnt possibly hear you And if
its scandal I dont want to know it

Look here Kit she retorted you neednt be so superior If I like
to talk scandal Im not so sure you arent making it

That was the way right along I was making scandal I brought them there
to dinner I let Bella in

And of course Anne came up then and began on me at once

You are a very bad girl she began What do you mean by treating Tom
Harbison the way you do He is heartbroken

I think you exaggerate my influence over him I retorted I havent
treated him badly because I havent paid any attention to him

Anne threw up her hands

There you are she said He worked all day yesterday fixing this
place for youyes for you my dear I am not blindand last night you
refused to let him bring you up

He told you I flamed

He wondered what he had done And as you wouldnt let him come within
speaking distance of you he came to me

I am sorry Anne since you are fond of him I said But to me he is
impossibleintolerable My reasons are quite sufficient

Kit is perfectly right Anne Leila broke in I tell you there is
something queer about him she added in a portentous whisper

Anne stiffened

He is perfect she declared Of good family warmhearted
courageous handsome cleverwhat more do you ask

Honesty said Leila hotly That a man should be what he says he is

Anne and I both stared

It is your Mr Harbison Leila went on who tried to escape from the
house by putting a board across to the next roof

I dont believe it said Anne You might bring me a picture of him
board in hand and I wouldnt believe it

Dont then Lollie said cruelly Let him get away with your pearls
they are yours Only as sure as anything the man who tried to escape
from the house had a reason for escaping and the papers said a man in
evening dress and light overcoat I found Mr Harbisons overcoat today
lying in a heap in one of the maids rooms and it was covered with
brick dust all over the front A button had even been torn off

Pooh Anne said when she had recovered herself a little There isnt
any reason as far as that goes why Flannigan shouldnt have worn Toms
overcoat orany of the others

Flannigan Leila said loftily Why his arms are like piano legs he
couldnt get into it As for the others there is only one person who
would fit or nearly fit that overcoat and that is Dallas Anne

While Anne was choking down her wrath Leila got up and darted out of
the tent When she came back she was triumphant

Look she said holding out her hand And on her palm lay a lightish
brown button I found it just where the paper said the board was thrown
out and it is from Mr Harbisons overcoat without a doubt

Of course I should not have been surprised A man who would kiss a woman
on a dark staircasea woman he had known only two dayswas capable of
anything

Kit has only been a little keener than the rest of us Lollie said
She found him out yesterday

Upon my word said Anne indignantly preparing to go if I didnt
know you girls so well I would think you were crazy And now just to
offset this I can tell you something Flannigan told me this morning
not to worry that he has my pearl collar spotted and that YOUNG LADIES
WILL HAVE THEIR JOKES

Yes as I said before it was a cheerful joyproducing situation

I sat and thought it over after Annes parting shot when Leila had
flounced downstairs Things were closing in I gave the situation
twentyfour hours to develop At the end of that time Flannigan would
accuse me openly of knowing where the pearls were I would explain my
silly remark to him and the mine would explodeunder Aunt Selina

I was sunk in dejected reverie when some one came on the roof When he
was opposite the opening in the tent I saw Mr Harbison and at that
moment he saw me He paused uncertainly then he made an evident effort
and came over to me

You arebetter today

Quite well thank you

I am glad you find the tent useful Does it keep off the wind

It is quite a shelterfrigidly

He still stood struggling for something to say Evidently nothing came
to his mind for he lifted the cap he was wearing and turning away
began to work with the wiring of the roof He was clever with tools one
could see that If he was a professional gentlemanburglar no doubt he
needed to be After a bit finding it necessary to climb to the parapet
he took off his coat without even a glance in my direction and fell to
work vigorously

One does not need to like a man to admire him physically any more than
one needs to like a race horse or any other splendid animal No one
could deny that the man on the parapet was a splendid animal he looked
quite big enough and strong enough to have tossed his slender bridge
across the gulf to the next roof without any difficulty and coordinate
enough to have crossed on it with a flourish to safety

Just then there was a rending tearing sound from the corner and a
muttered ejaculation I looked up in time to see Mr Harbison throw up
his arms make a futile attempt to regain his balance and disappear
over the edge of the roof One instant he was standing there splendid
superb the next the corner of the parapet was empty all that stood
there was a broken splintered post and a tangle of wires

I could not have moved at first at least it seemed hours before the
full significance of the thing penetrated my dazed brain When I got up
I seemed to walk to crawl with leaden weights holding back my feet

When I got to the corner I had to catch the post for support I knew
somebody was saying Oh how terrible over and over It was only
afterward that I knew it had been myself And then some other voice was
saying Dont be alarmed Please dont be frightened Im all right

I dared to look over the parapet finally and instead of a crushed and
unspeakable body there was Mr Harbison sitting about eight feet below
me with his feet swinging into space and a long red scratch from the
corner of his eye across his cheek There was a sort of mansard there
with windows and just enough coping to keep him from rolling off

I thought you had fallenall the way I gasped trying to keep my
lips from trembling Ioh dont dangle your feet like that

He did not seem at all glad of his escape He sat there gloomily
peering into the gulf beneath

If it wasnt soermessy and generally unpleasant he replied
without looking up I would slide off and go the rest of the way

You are childish I said severely See if you can get through the
window behind you If you can not Ill come down and unfasten it But
the window was open and I had a chance to sit down and gather up the
scattered ends of my nerves To my surprise however when he came back
he made no effort to renew our conversation He ignored me completely
and went to work at once to repair the damage to his wires with his
back to me

I think you are very rude I said at last You fell over there and I
thought you were killed The nervous shock I experienced is just as bad
as if you had goneall the way

He put down the hammer and came over to me without speaking Then when
he was quite close he said

I am very sorry if I startled you I did not flatter myself that you
would be profoundly affected in any event

Oh as to that I said lightly it makes me ill for days if my car
runs over a dog He looked at me in silence You are not going to get
up on that parapet again

Mrs Wilson he said without paying the slightest attention to my
question will you tell me what I have done

Done

Or have not done I have racked my brainsstayed awake all of last
night At first I hoped it was impersonal that womanlike you were
merely venting general disfavor on one particular individual Butyour
hostility is to me personally

I raised my eyebrows coldly interrogative

Perhaps he went on calmlyperhaps I was a fool here on the
roofthe night before last If I said anything that I should not I ask
your pardon If it is not that I think you ought to ask mine

I was angry enough then

There can be only one opinion about your conduct I retorted warmly
It was worse than brutal Itit was unspeakable I have no words for
itexcept that I loathe itand you

He was very grim by this time I have heard you say something like that
beforeonly I was not the unfortunate in that case

Oh I was choking

Under different circumstances I should be the last person to recall
anything sopersonal But the circumstances are unusual He took an
angry step toward me Will you tell me what I have done Or shall I go
down and ask the others

You wouldnt dare I cried or I will tell them what you did How you
waylaid me on those stairs there and forced your caresses your kisses
on me Oh I could die with shame

The silence that followed was as unexpected as it was ominous I knew
he was staring at me and I was furious to find myself so emotional so
much more the excited of the two Finally I looked up

You can not deny it I said a sort of anticlimax

No He was very quiet very grim quite composed No he repeated
judicially I do not deny it

He did not Or he would not Which



Chapter XIV ALMOST BUT NOT QUITE

Dal had been acting strangely all day Once early in the evening when
I had doubled no trump he led me a club without apology and later
on during his dummy I saw him writing our names on the back of an
envelope and putting numbers after them At my earliest opportunity I
went to Max

There is something the matter with Dal Max I volunteered He
has been acting strangely all day and just now he was making out a
listnames and numbers

Youre to blame for that Kit Max said seriously You put washing
soda instead of baking soda in those biscuits today and he thinks he is
a steam laundry Those are laundry lists hes making out He asked me a
little while ago if I wanted a domestic finish

Yes I had put washing soda in the biscuits The book said soda and how
is one to know which is meant

I do not think you are calculated for a domestic finish I said coldly
as I turned away In any case I disclaim any such responsibility
Butthere is SOMETHING on Dals mind

Max came after me Dont be cross Kit You havent said a nice word
to me today and you go around bristling with your chin up and two red
spots on your cheekslike whateverhernamewas with the snakes instead
of hair I dont know why Im so crazy about you I always meant to love
a girl with a nice disposition

I left him then Dal had gone into the reception room and closed the
doors And because he had been acting so strangely and partly to escape
from Max whose eyes looked threatening I followed him Just as I
opened the door quietly and looked in Dallas switched off the lights
and I could hear him groping his way across the room Then somebodynot
Dalspoke from the corner cautiously

Is that you Mr Brown sir It was Flannigan

Yes Is everything here

All but the powder sir Dont step too close Theyre spread all over
the place

Have you taken the curtains down

Yes sir

Matches

Here sir

Light one will you Flannigan I want to see the time

The flare showed Dallas and Flannigan bent over the timepiece And it
showed something else The rug had been turned back from the windows
which opened on the street and the curtains had been removed On the
bare hardwood floor just beneath the windows was an array of pans of
various sizes dish pans cake tins and a metal foot tub The pans were
raised from the floor on bricks and seemed to be full of paper All the
chairs and tables were pushed back against the wall and the bricabrac
was stacked on the mantel

Half an hour yet Dal said closing his watch Plenty of time and
remember the signal four short and two long

Four short and two longall right sir

AndFlannigan heres something for you on account

Thank you sir

Dal turned to go out tripped over the rug said something and passed
me without an idea of my presence A moment later Flannigan went out
and I was left huddled against the wall and alone

It was puzzling enough Four long and two short All but the powder
Not that I believed for a moment what Max had said and anyhow Flannigan
was the sanest person I ever saw in my life But it all seemed a part
of the mystery that had been hanging over us for several days I felt my
way across the room and knelt by the pans Yes they were there full of
paper and mounted on bricks It had not been a delusion

And then I straightened on my knees suddenly for an automobile passing
under the windows had sounded four short honks and two long ones The
signal was followed instantly by a crash The foot bath had fallen from
its supports and lay quivering and vibrating with horrid noises at my
feet The next moment Mr Harbison had thrown open the door and leaped
into the room

Whos there he demanded Against the light I could see him reaching
for his hip pocket and the rest crowding up around him

Its only me I quavered that is I Thethe dish pan upset

Dish pan Bella said from back in the crowd Kit of course

Jim forced his way through then and turned on the lights I have no
doubt I looked very strange kneeling there on the bare floor with a
row of pans mounted on bricks behind me and the furniture all piled on
itself in a back corner

Kit What in the world Jim began and stopped He stared from me to
the pans to the windows to the bricabrac on the mantel and back to
me

I sat stonily silent Why should I explain Whenever I got into a
foolish position and tried to explain and tell how it happened and
who was really to blame they always brought it back to ME somehow So I
sat there on the floor and let them stare And finally Lollie Mercer got
her breath and said How perfectly lovely its a charade

And Anne guessed kitchen at once Kit you know and the pans
andall that she said vaguely At that they all took to guessing And
I sat still until Mr Harbison saw the storm in my eyes and came over
to me

Have you hurt your ankle he said in an undertone Let me help you
up

I am not hurt I said coldly and even if I were it would be
unnecessary to trouble you

I can not help being troubled he returned just as evenly You see
it makes me ill for days if my car runs over a dog

Luckily at that moment Dal came in He pushed his way through the
crowd without a word shut off the lights crashed through the pans and
slammed the shutters closed Then he turned and addressed the rest

Of all the lunatics he began only there was more to it than that
A fellow goes to all kinds of trouble to put an end to this miserable
situation and the entire household turns out and sets to work to
frustrate the whole scheme You LIKE to stay here dont you like
chickens in a coop Wheres Flannigan

Nobody understood Dals wrath then but it seems he meant to arrange
the plot himself and when it was ripe and the hour nearly come he
intended to wager that he could break the quarantine and to take any
odds he could get that he would free the entire party in half an hour
As for the plan itself it was idiotically simple we were perfectly
delighted when we heard it It was so simple and yet so comprehensive
We didnt see how it COULD fail Both the Mercer girls kissed Dal on the
strength of it and Anne was furious Jim was not so much pleased for
some reason or other and Mr Harbison looked thoughtful rather than
merry Aunt Selina had gone to bed

The idea of course was to start an embryo fire just inside the
windows in the pans to feed it with the orangefire powder that is
used on the Fourth of July and when we had thrown open the windows and
yelled fire and all the guards and reporters had rushed to the
front of the house to escape quietly by a rear door from the basement
kitchen get into machines Dal had in waiting and lose ourselves as
quickly as we could

You can see how simple it was

We were terribly excited of course Every one rushed madly for motor
coats and veils and Dal shuffled the numbers so the people going the
same direction would have the same machine We called to each other as
we dressed about Mamaroneck or Lakewood or wherever we happened to have
relatives Everybody knew everybody else and his friends The Mercer
girls were going to cruise until the trouble blew over the Browns were
going to Pinehurst and Jim was going to Africa to hunt if he could get
out of the harbor

Only the Harbison man seemed to have no plans quite suddenly with the
world so near again the world of country houses and steam yachts and
all the rest of it he ceased to be one of us It was not his world at
all He stood back and watched the kaleidoscope of our coats and veils
halfquizzically but with something in his face that I had not seen
there before If he had not been so selfreliant and big I would have
said he was lonely Not that he was pathetic in any sense of the word
Of course he avoided me which was natural and exactly what I wished
Bella never was far from him and at the last she loaded him with her
jewel case and a muff and traveling bag and asked him to her cousins on
Long Island I felt sure he was going to decline when he glanced across
at me

Do go I said very politely They are charming people And he
accepted at once

It was a transparent plot on Bellas part Two elderly maiden ladies
house miles from anywhere long evenings in the music room with an open
fire and Bella at the harp playing the two songs she knows

When we were ready and gathered in the kitchen in the darkness of
course Dal went up on the roof and signaled with a lantern to the cars
on the drive Then he went downstairs took a last look at the drawing
room fired the papers shook on the powder opened the windows and
yelled fire

Of course huddled in the kitchen we had heard little or nothing But we
plainly heard Dal on the first floor and Flannigan on the second yelling
fire and the patter of feet as the guards ran to the front of the
house And at that instant we remembered Aunt Selina

That was the cause of the whole trouble I dont know why they turned on
me she wasnt my aunt But by the time we had got her out of bed and
had wrapped her in an eiderdown comfort and stuck slippers on her feet
and a motor veil on her head the glare at the front of the house was
beginning to die away She didnt understand at all and we had no time
to explain I remember that she wanted to go back and get her plate
whatever that may be but Jim took her by the arm and hurried her along
and the rest who had waited and were in awful tempers stood aside and
let them out first

The door to the area steps was open and by the street lights we could
see a fence and a gate which opened on a side street Jim and Aunt
Selina ran straight for the gate the wind blowing Aunt Selinas comfort
like a sail Then with our feet so to speak on the first rungs of the
ladder of Liberty it slipped A halfdozen guards and reporters came
around the house and drove us back like sheep into a slaughter pen It
was the most humiliating moment of my life

Dal had been for fighting a way through and just for a minute I think
I went Berserk myself But Max spied one of the reporters setting up a
flash light as we stood undecided at the top of the steps and after
that there was nothing to do but retreat We backed down slowly to show
them we were not afraid And when we were all in the kitchen again and
had turned on the lights and Bella was crying with her head against Mr
Harbisons arm Dal said cheerfully

Well it has done some good anyhow We have lost Aunt Selina

And we all shook hands on it although we were sorry about Jim And Dal
said we would have some champagne and drink to Aunt Selinas comfort
and we could have her teeth fumigated and send them to her Somebody
said Poor old Jim and at that Bella looked up

She stared around the group and then she went quite pale

Jim she gasped Do you meanthat Jim isout there too

Jim and Aunt Selina I said as calmly as I could for joy You can see
how it simplified the situation for me By this time they are a mile
away and going

Everybody shook hands again except Bella She had dropped into a chair
and sat biting her lip and breathing hard and she would not join in any
of the hilarity at getting rid of Aunt Selina Finally she got up and
knocked over her chair

You are a lot of cowards she stormed You deserted them out there
left them Heaven knows where they area defenseless old woman
andand a man who did not even have an overcoat And it is snowing

Never mind Dal said reassuringly He can borrow Aunt Selinas
comfort Make the old lady discard from weakness Anyhow Bella if I
know anything of human nature the old lady will make it hot enough for
him Poor old Jim

Then they shook hands again and with that there came a terrible banging
at the door which we had locked

Open the door some one commanded It was one of the guards

Open it yourself Dallas called moving a kitchen table to reenforce
the lock

Open that door or we will break it in

Dallas put his hands in his pockets seated himself on the table and
whistled cheerfully We could hear them conferring outside and they
made another appeal which was refused Suddenly Bella came over and
confronted Dallas

They have brought them back she said dramatically They are out
there now I distinctly heard Jims voice Open that door Dallas

Oh DONT let them in I wailed It was quite involuntary but the
disappointment was too awful Dallas DONT open that door

Dal swung his feet and smiled from Bella to me

Think what a solution it is to all our difficulties he said easily
Without Aunt Selina I could be happy here indefinitely

There was more knocking and somebodyMax I thinksaid to let them
in that it was a fool thing anyhow and that he wanted to go to bed and
forget it his feet were cold And just then there was a crash and part
of one of the windows fell in The next blow from outside brought the
rest of the glass andsomebody was coming through feet first It was
Jim

He did not speak to any of us but turned and helped in a bundle of red
and yellow silk comfort that proved to be Aunt Selina also feet first
I had a glimpse of a halfdozen heads outside guards and reporters
Then Jim jerked the shade down and unswathed Aunt Selinas legs so
that she could walk offered his arm and stalked past us and upstairs
without a word

None of us spoke We turned out the lights and went upstairs and took
off our wraps and went to bed It had been almost a fiasco



Chapter XV SUSPICION AND DISCORD

Every one was nasty the next morning Aunt Selina declared that her
feet were frostbitten and kept Bella rubbing them with ice water all
morning And Jim was impossible He refused to speak to any of us and he
watched Bella furtively as if he suspected her of trying to get him out
of the house

When luncheon time came around and he had shown no indication of going
to the telephone and ordering it we had a conclave and Max was chosen
to remind him of the hour Jim was shut in the studio and we waited
together in the hall while Max went up When he came down he was
somewhat ruffled

He wouldnt open the door he reported and when I told him it was
meal time he said he wasnt hungry and he didnt give a whoop about
the rest of us He had asked us here to dinner he hadnt proposed to
adopt us

So we finally ordered luncheon ourselves and about two oclock Jim came
downstairs sheepishly and ate what was left Anne declared that Bella
had been scolding him in the upper hall but I doubted it She was never
seen to speak to him unnecessarily

The excitement of the escape over Mr Harbison and I remained on terms
of armed neutrality And Max still hunted for Annes pearls using them
the men declared as a good excuse to avoid tinkering with the furnace
or repairing the dumb waiter which took the queerest notions and
stopped once halfway up from the kitchen for an hour with the dinner
on it Anyhow Max was searching the house systematically armed with
a copy of Poes Purloined Letter and Gaboriaus Monsieur LeCoq He went
through the seats of the chairs with hatpins tore up the beds and
lifted rugs until the house was in a state of confusion And the next
day the fourth he found somethingnot much but it was curious He
had been in the studio poking around behind the dusty pictures with
Jimmy expostulating every time he moved anything and the rest standing
around watching him

Max was strutting

We get it by elimination he said importantly The pearls being
nowhere else in the house they must be here in the studio Three parts
of the studio having yielded nothing they must be in the fourth Ladies
and gentlemen let me have your attention for one moment I tap this
canvas with my wandthere is nothing up my sleeve Then I prepare
to move the canvasso And I put my hand in the pocket of this
disreputable velvet coat so Behold

Then he gave a low exclamation and looked at something he held in his
hand Every one stepped forward and on his palm was the small diamond
clasp from Annes collar

Jimmy was apoplectic He tried to smile but no one else did

Well Ill be flabbergasted he said I say you people you dont
think for a minute that I put that thing there Why I havent worn that
coat for a month Itsits a trick of yours Max

But Max shook his head he looked stupefied and stood gazing from the
clasp to the pocket of the old painting coat Betty dropped on a folding
stool that promptly collapsed with her and created a welcome diversion
while Anne pounced on the clasp greedily with a little cry

We will find it all now she said excitedly Did you look in the
other pockets Max

Then for the first time I was conscious of an air of constraint among
the men Dallas was whistling softly and Mr Harbison having
rescued Betty was standing silent and aloof watching the scene
with noncommittal eyes It was Max who spoke first after a hurried
inventory of the other pockets

Nothing else he said constrainedly Ill move the rest of the
canvases

But Jim interfered to every ones surprise

I wouldnt if I were you Max Theres nothing back there I had em
out yesterday He was quite pale

Nonsense Max said gruffly If its a practical joke Jim why dont
you fess up Anne has worried enough

The pearls are not there I tell you Jim began Although the studio
was cold there were little fine beads of moisture on his face I must
ask you not to move those pictures And then Aunt Selina came to the
rescue she stalked over and stood with her back against the stack of
canvases

As far as I can understand this she declaimed you gentlemen are
trying to intimate that James knows something of that young womans
jewelry because you found part of it in his pocket Certainly you will
not move the pictures How do you know that the young gentleman who said
he found it there didnt have it up his sleeve

She looked around triumphantly and Max glowered Dallas soothed her
however

Exactly so he said How do we know that Max didnt have the clasp
up his sleeve My dear lady neither my wife nor I care anything for the
pearls as compared with the priceless pearl of peace I suggest tea on
the roof those in favor My arm Miss Caruthers

It was all well enough for Jim to say later that he didnt dare to have
the canvases moved for he had stuck behind them all sorts of chorus
girl photographs and lifeclass crayons that were not for Aunt Selinas
eye besides four empty siphons two full ones and three bottles of
whisky Not a soul believed him there was a a new element of suspicion
and discord in the house

Every one went up on the roof and left him to his mystery Anne drank
her tea in a preoccupied silence with halfclosed eyes an attitude
that boded ill to somebody The rest were feverishly gay and Aunt
Selina with a pair of arctics on her feet and a hotwater bottle at her
back sat in the middle of the tent and told me familiar anecdotes of
Jimmys early youth had he known he would have slain her Betty and
Mr Harbison had found a medicine ball and were running around like
a pair of children It was quite certain that neither his escape from
death nor my accusation weighed heavily on him

While Aunt Selina was busy with the time Jim had swallowed an open
safety pin and just as the pin had been coughed up or taken out of
his noseI forget whichJim himself appeared and sulkily demanded the
privacy of the roof for his training hour

Yes he was training Flannigan claimed to know the system that had
reduced the president to what he is and he and Jim had a seance every
day which left Jim feeling himself for bruises all evening He claimed
to be losing flesh he said he could actually feel it going and he and
Flannigan had spent an entire afternoon in the cellar three days before
with a potato barrel a caneseated chair and a lamp

The whole thing had been shrouded in mystery They sandpapered the
inside of the barrel and took out all the nails and when they had
finished they carried it to the roof and put it in a corner behind the
tent Everybody was curious but Flannigan refused any information about
it and merely said it was part of his system Dal said that if HE had
anything like that in his system he certainly would be glad to get rid
of it

At a quarter to six Jim appeared still sullen from the events of the
afternoon and wearing a dressing gown and a pair of slippers Flannigan
following him with a sponge a bucket of water and an armful of bath
towels Everybody protested at having to move but he was firm and they
all filed down the stairs I was the last with Aunt Selina just ahead
of me At the top of the stairs she turned around suddenly to me

That policeman looks cruel she said Whats more hes been in a
bad humor all day More than likely hell put James flat on the roof
and tramp on him under pretense of training him All policemen are
inhuman

He only rolls him over a barrel or something like that I protested

James had a bump like an egg over his ear last night Aunt Selina
insisted glaring at Flannigans unconscious back I dont think its
safe to leave him It is my time to relax for thirty minutes or I
would watch him You will have to stay she said fixing me with her
imperious eyes

So I stayed Jim didnt want me and Flannigan muttered mutiny But
it was easier to obey Aunt Selina than to clash with her and anyhow I
wanted to see the barrel in use

I never saw any one train before It is not a joyful spectacle First
Flannigan made Jim run around and around the roof He said it stirred
up his food and brought it in contact with his liver to be digested

Flannigan from meekness and submission of a sort in the kitchen
became an autocrat on the roof

Once more he would say Pick up your feet sir Pick up your feet

And Jim would stagger doggedly past me where I sat on the parapet his
poor cheeks shaking and the tail of his bath robe wrapping itself around
his legs Yes he ran in the bath robe in deference to me It seems
there isnt much to a running suit

Head up Flannigan would say Lift your knees sir Didnt you ever
see a horse with string halt

He let him stop finally and gave him a moment to get his breath Then
he set him to turning somersaults They spread the cushions from the
couch in the tent on the roof and Jim would poke his head down and say
a prayer and then curve over as gracefully as a sausage and come up
gasping as if he had been pushed off a boat

Five pounds a day not less sir Flannigan said encouragingly
Youll drop it in chunks

Jim looked at the tin as if he expected to see the chunks lying at his
feet

Yes he said wiping the back of his neck If were in here thirty
days that will be one hundred and fifty pounds Dont forget to stop in
time Flannigan I dont want to melt away like a candle

He was cheered however by the promise of reduction

What do you think of that Kit he called to me Your uncle is going
to look as angular as a problem in geometry IllIll be the original
reductio ad absurdum Do you want me to stand on my head Flannigan
Wouldnt that reduce something

Your brains sir Flannigan retorted gravely and presented a pair of
boxing gloves Jim visibly quailed but he put them on

Do you know Flannigan he remarked as he fastened them Im
thinking of wearing these all the time They hide my character

Flannigan looked puzzled but he did not ask an explanation He demanded
that Jim shed the bath robe which he finally did on my promise to
watch the sunset Then for fully a minute there was no sound save of
feet running rapidly around the roof and an occasional soft thud Each
thud was accompanied by a grunt or two from Jim Flannigan was grimly
silent Once there was a smart rap an oath from the policeman and a
mirthless chuckle from Jim The chuckle ended in a crash however and I
turned Jim was lying on his back on the roof and Flannigan was wiping
his ear with a towel Jim sat up and ran his hand down his ribs

Theyre all here he observed after a minute I thought I missed
one

The only way to take a mans weight down Flannigan said dryly

Jim got up dizzily

Down on the roof I suppose you mean he said

The next proceedings were mysterious Flannigan rolled the barrel into
the tent and carried in a small glass lamp With the material at hand
he seemed to be effecting a combination no new one to judge by his
facility Then he called Jim

At the door of the tent Jim turned to me his bathrobe toga fashion
around his shoulders

This is a very essential part of the treatment he said solemnly The
exercise according to Flannigan loosens up the adipose tissue The
next step is to boil it out I hope unless your instructions compel
you that you will at least have the decency to stay out of the tent

I am going at once I said outraged Im not here because Im mad
about it and you know it And dont pose with that bath robe If you
think youre a character out of Roman history look at your legs

I didnt mean to offend you he said sulkily Only Im tired of
having you choked down my throat every time I open my mouth Kit And
dont go just yet Flannigan is going for my clothes as soon as he
lights thethe lamp andsomebody ought to watch the stairs

That was all there was to it I said I would guard the steps and
Flannigan having ignited the combination whatever it was went
downstairs How was I to know that Bella would come up when she did Was
it my fault that the lamp got too high and that Flannigan couldnt
hear Jim calling Or that just as Bella reached the top of the steps
Jim should come to the door of the tent wearing the barrel part of his
hotair cabinet and yelling for a doctor

Bella came to a dead stop on the upper step with her mouth open She
looked at Jim at the inadequate barrel and from them she looked at me
Then she began to laugh one of her hysterical giggles and she turned
and went down again As Jim and I stared at each other we could hear her
gurgling down the hall below

She had violent hysterics for an hour with Anne rubbing her forehead
and Aunt Selina burning a feather out of the feather duster under her
nose Only Jim and I understood and we did not tell Luckily the next
thing that occurred drove Bella and her nerves from everybodys mind

At seven oclock when Bella had dropped asleep and everybody else was
dressed for dinner Aunt Selina discovered that the house was cold and
ordered Dal to the furnace

It was Dals day at the furnace Flannigan had been relieved of that
part of the work after twice setting fire to a chimney

In five minutes Dal came back and spoke a few words to Max who followed
him to the basement and in ten minutes more Flannigan puffed up the
steps and called Mr Harbison

I am not curious but I knew that something had happened While Aunt
Selina was talking suffrage to Annewho said she had always been
tremendously interested in the subject and if women got the suffrage
would they be allowed to voteI slipped back to the dining room

The table was laid for dinner but Flannigan was not in sight I could
hear voices from somewhere faint voices that talked rapidly and after
a while I located the sounds under my feet The men were all in the
basement and something must have happened I flew back to the basement
stairs to meet Mr Harbison at the foot He was grimy and dusty
with streaks of coal dust over his face and he had been examining his
revolver I was just in time to see him slip it into his pocket

What is the matter I demanded Is any one hurt

No one he said coolly Weve been cleaning out the furnace

With a revolver How interestingand unusual I said dryly and
slipped past him as he barred the way He was not pleased I heard him
mutter something and come rapidly after me but I had the voices as a
guide and I was not going to be turned back like a child The men had
gathered around a low stone arch in the furnace room and were looking
down a short flight of steps into a sort of vault evidently under the
pavement A faint light came from a small grating above and there was a
close musty smell in the air

I tell you it must have been last night Dallas was saying Wilson
and I were here before we went to bed and Ill swear that hole was not
there then

It was not there this morning sir Flannigan insisted It has been
made during the day

And it could not have been done this afternoon Mr Harbison said
quietly I was fussing with the telephone wire down here I would have
heard the noise

Something in his voice made me look at him and certainly his expression
was unusual He was watching us all intently while Dallas pointed out to
me the cause of the excitement From the main floor of the furnace room
a flight of stone steps surmounted by an arch led into the coal cellar
beneath the street The coal cellar was of brick with a cement floor
and in the left wall there gaped an opening about three feet by three
leading into a cavernous void perfectly blackevidently a similar
vault belonging to the next house

The whole place was ghostly full of shadows shivery with
possibilities It was Mr Harbison finally who took Jims candle and
crawled through the aperture We waited in dead silence listening to
his feet crunching over the coal beyond watching the faint yellow light
that came through the ragged opening in the wall Then he came back and
called through to us

Place is locked over here he said Heavy oak door at the head of
the steps Whoever made that opening has done a prodigious amount of
labor for nothing

The weapon a crowbar lay on the ground beside the bricks and he
picked it up and balanced it on his hand Dallas florid face was almost
comical in his bewilderment as for Jimmyhe slammed a piece of slag at
the furnace and walked away At the door he turned around

Why dont you accuse me of it he asked bitterly Maybe you could
find a lump of coal in my pockets if you searched me

He stalked up the stairs then and left us Dallas and I went up
together but we did not talk There seemed to be nothing to say Not
until I had closed and locked the door of my room did I venture to look
at something that I carried in the palm of my hand It was a watch not
runninga gentlemans flat gold watch and it had been hanging by its
fob to a nail in the bricks beside the aperture

In the back of the watch were the initials THH and the picture of a
girl cut from a newspaper

It was my picture



Chapter XVI I FACE FLANNIGAN

Dinner waited that night while everybody went to the coal cellar and
stared at the hole in the wall and watched while Max took a tracing of
it and of some footprints in the coal dust on the other side

I did not go I went into the library with the guilty watch in the fold
of my gown and found Mr Harbison there staring through the February
gloom at the blank wall of the next house and quite unconscious of the
reporter with a drawing pad just below him in the areaway I went over
and closed the shutters before his very eyes but even then he did not
move

Will you be good enough to turn around I demanded at last

Oh he said wheeling Are YOU here

There wasnt any reply to that so I took the watch and placed it on the
library table between us The effect was all that I had hoped He stared
at it for an instant then at me and with his hand outstretched for it
stopped

Where did you find it he asked I couldnt understand his expression
He looked embarrassed but not at all afraid

I think you know Mr Harbison I retorted

I wish I did You opened it

Yes

We stood looking at each other across the table It was his glance that
wavered

About the pictureof you he said at last You see down there in
South America a fellow hasnt much to do in the evenings and aa chum
of mine and Iwe were awfully down on what we called the plutocrats
thethe leisure classes And when that picture of yours came in the
paper we hadwe had an argument He said He stopped

What did he say

Well he said it was the picture of an emptyfaced society girl

Oh I exclaimed

II maintained there were possibilities in the face He put both
hands on the table and bending forward looked down at me Well I
was a fool I admit I said your eyes were kind and candid in spite of
that haughty mouth You see I said I was a fool

I think you are exceedingly rude I managed finally If you want to
know where I found your watch it was down in the coal cellar And
if you admit you are an idiot I am not II know all about Bellas
braceletand the board on the roof andoh if you would only
leaveAnnes necklaceon the coal or somewhereand get away

My voice got beyond me then and I dropped into a chair and covered my
face I could feel him staring at the back of my head

Well Ill be something or other he said finally and then he
turned on his heel and went out By the time I got my eyes dry yes I
was crying I always do when I am angry I heard Jim coming downstairs
and I tucked the watch out of sight Would anyone have foreseen the
trouble that watch would make

Jim was sulky He dropped into a chair and stretched out his legs
looking gloomily at nothing Then he got up and ambled into his den
closing the door behind him without having spoken a word It was more
than human nature could stand

When I went into the den he was stretched on the davenport with his face
buried in the cushions He looked absolutely wilted and every line of
him was drooping

Go on out Kit he said in a smothered voice Be a good girl and
dont follow me around

You are shameless I gasped Follow you When you are hung around
my neck like alike a Millstone was what I wanted to say but I
couldnt think of it

He turned over and looked up from his cushions like an illtreated and
suffering cherub

Im done for Kit he groaned Bella went up to the studio after we
left and investigated that corner

What did she find The necklace I asked eagerly He was too wretched
to notice this

No that picture of you that I did last winter She is crazyshe says
she is going upstairs and sit in Takahiros room and take smallpox and
die

Fiddlesticks I said rudely and somebody hammered on the door and
opened it

Pardon me for disturbing you Bella said in her best
dearmeImgladIknocked manner ButFlannigan says the dinner has
not come

Good Lord Jim exclaimed I forgot to order the confounded dinner

It was eight oclock by that time and as it took an hour at least
after telephoning the order everybody looked blank when they heard The
entire family except Mr Harbison who had not appeared again escorted
Jim to the telephone and hung around hungrily suggesting new dishes
every minute And thenhe couldnt raise Central It was fifteen
minutes before we gave up and stood staring at one another
despairingly

Call out of a window and get one of those infernal reporters to
do something useful for once Max suggested But he was indignantly
hushed We would have starved first Jim was peering into the
transmitter and knocking the receiver against his hand like a watch
that had stopped But nothing happened Flannigan reported a box of
breakfast food two lemons and a pineapple cheese a combination that
didnt seem to lend itself to anything

We went back to the dining room from sheer force of habit and sat around
the table and looked at the lemonade Flannigan had made Anne WOULD talk
about the salad her last cook had concocted and Max told about a little
town in Connecticut where the restaurant keeper smokes a corncob pipe
while he cooks the most luscious fried clams in America And Aunt Selina
related that in her family they had a recipe for chicken smothered in
cream And then we sipped the weak lemonade and nibbled at the cheese

To change this gridiron martyrdom Dallas said finally wheres
Harbison Still looking for his watch

Watch Everybody said it in a different tone

Sure he responded Says his watch was taken last night from the
studio Better get him down to take a squint at the telephone Likely he
can fix it

Flannigan was beside me with the cheese And at that moment I felt Mr
Harbisons stolen watch slip out of my girdle slide greasily across
my lap and clatter to the floor Flannigan stooped but luckily it had
gone under the table To have had it picked up to have had to explain
how I got it to see them try to ignore my picture pasted in itoh it
was impossible I put my foot over it

Drop something Dallas asked perfunctorily rising Flannigan was
still half kneeling

A fork I said as easily as I could and the conversation went on
But Flannigan knew and I knew he knew He watched my every movement
like a hawk after that standing just behind my chair I dropped my
useless napkin to have it whirled up before it reached the floor I
said to Betty that my shoe buckle was loose and actually got the watch
in my hand only to let it slip at the critical moment Then they all
got up and went sadly back to the library and Flannigan and I faced
each other

Flannigan was not a handsome man at any time though up to then he had
at least looked amiable But now as I stood with my hand on the back of
my chair his face grew suddenly menacing The silence was absolute
I was the guiltiest wretch alive and opposite me the law towered and
glowered and held the yellow remnant of a pineapple cheese And in the
silence that wretched watch lay and ticked and ticked and ticked Then
Flannigan creaked over and closed the door into the hall came back
picked up the watch and looked at it

Youre unlucky Im thinkin he said finally Youve got the nerve
all right but you aint cute enough

I dont know what you mean I quavered Give me that watch to return
to Mr Harbison

Not on your life he retorted easily I give it back myself like
I did the bracelet andlike Im going to give back the necklace if
youll act like a sensible little girl

I could only choke

Its foolish any way you look at it he persisted Here you are
lots of friends folks that think youre all right Why I reckon there
isnt one of them that wouldnt lend you money if you needed it so bad

Will you be still I said furiously Mr Harbison left that
watchwith mean hour ago Get him and he will tell you so himself

Of course he would Flannigan conceded looking at me with grudging
approval He wouldnt be what I think he is if he didnt lie up and
down for you There were voices in the hall Flannigan came closer
An hour ago you say And he told me it was gone this morning Its
a losing game miss Ill give you twentyfour hours and thenthe
necklace if you please miss



Chapter XVII A CLASH AND A KISS

The clash that came that evening had been threatening for some time
Take an immovable body represented by Mr Harbison and his square jaw
and an irresistible force Jimmy and his weight and there is bound to
be trouble

The real fault was Jims He had gone entirely mad again over Bella and
thrown prudence to the winds He mooned at her across the dinner table
and waylaid her on the stairs or in the back halls just to hear her
voice when she ordered him out of her way He telephoned for flowers and
candy for her quite shamelessly and he got out a book of photographs
that they had taken on their wedding journey and kept it on the library
table The sole concession he made to our presumptive relationship was
to bring me the responsibility for everything that went wrong and his
shirts for buttons

The first I heard of the trouble was from Dal He waylaid me in the hall
after dinner that night and his face was serious

Im afraid we cant keep it up very long Kit he said With Jim
trailing Bella all over the house and the old lady keener every day
its bound to come out somehow And that isnt all Jim and Harbison had
a setto todayabout you

About me I repeated Oh I dare say I have been falling short again
What was Jim doing Abusing me

Dal looked cautiously over his shoulder but no one was near

It seems that the gentle Bella has been unusually beastly today to Jim
andI believe shes jealous of you Kit Jim followed her up to the
roof before dinner with a box of flowers and she tossed them over the
parapet She said I believe that she didnt want his flowers he could
buy them for you and be damned to him or some ladylike equivalent

Jim is a jellyfish I said contemptuously What did he say

He said he only cared for one woman and that was Bella that he never
had really cared for you and never would and that divorce courts were
not unmitigated evils if they showed people the way to real happiness
Which wouldnt amount to anything if Harbison had not been in the tent
trying to sleep

Dal did not know all the particulars but it seems that relations
between Jim and Mr Harbison were rather strained Bella had left the
roof and Jim and the Harbison man came face to face in the door of the
tent According to Dal little had been said but Jim bound by his
promise to me could not explain and could only stammer something about
being an old friend of Miss Knowles And Tom had replied shortly that
it was none of his business but that there were some things friendship
hardly justified and tried to pass Jim Jim was instantly enraged he
blocked the door to the roof and demanded to know what the other man
meant There were two or three versions of the answer he got The
general purport was that Mr Harbison had no desire to explain further
and that the situation was forced on him But if he insistedwhen a man
systematically ignored and neglected his wife for some one else there
were communities where he would be tarred and feathered

Meaning me Jim demanded apoplectic

The remark was a general one Mr Harbison retorted but if you wish
to make a concrete application

Dal had gone up just then and found them glaring at each other Jim
with his hands clenched at his sides and Mr Harbison with his arms
folded and very erect Dal took Jim by the elbow and led him downstairs
muttering and the situation was saved for the time But Dal was not
optimistic

You can do a bit yourself Kit he finished Look more cheerful
flirt a little You can do that without trying Take Max on for a day or
so it would be charity anyhow But dont let Tom Harbison take into his
head that you are grieving over Jims neglect or hes likely to toss
him off the roof

I have no reason to think that Mr Harbison cares one way or the other
about me I said primly You dont think heshes in love with me
do you Dal I watched him out of the corner of my eye but he only
looked amused

In love with you he repeated Why bless your wicked little heart
no He thinks youre a married woman Its the principle of the thing
hes fighting for If I had as much principle as he has IdId put it
out at interest

Max interrupted us just then and asked if we knew where Mr Harbison
was

Cant find him he said Ive got the telephone together and have
enough left over to make another Where do you suppose Harbison hides
the tools Im working with a corkscrew and two palette knives

I heard nothing more of the trouble that night Max went to Jim about
it and Jim said angrily that only a fool would interfere between a man
and his wifewives Whereupon Max retorted that a fool and his wives
were soon parted and left him The two principals were coldly civil
to each other and smaller issues were lost as the famine grew more and
more insistent For famine it was

They worked the rest of the evening but the telephone refused to revive
and every one was starving Individually our pride was at low ebb but
collectively it was still formidable So we sat around and Jim played
Grieg with the soft stops on and Aunt Selina went to bed The weather
had changed and it was sleeting but anything was better than the
drawing room I was in a mood to battle with the elements or to cryor
bothso I slipped out while Dal was reciting Give me three grains
of corn mother threw somebodys overcoat over my shoulders put on a
mans soft hatJims I thinkand went up to the roof

It was dark in the third floor hall and I had to feel my way to the
foot of the stairs I went up quietly and turned the knob of the door
to the roof At first it would not open and I could hear the wind
howling outside Finally however I got the door open a little and
wormed my way through It was not entirely dark out there in spite of
the storm A faint reflection of the street lights made it possible to
distinguish the outlines of the boxwood plants swaying in the wind and
the chimneys and the tent And thena dark figure disentangled itself
from the nearest chimney and seemed to hurl itself at me I remember
putting out my hands and trying to say something but the figure caught
me roughly by the shoulders and knocked me back against the door frame
From miles away a heavy voice was saying So Ive got you and then
the roof gave from under me and I was floating out on the storm and
sleet was beating in my face and the wind was whispering over and over
Open your eyes for Gods sake

I did open them after a while and finally I made out that I was laying
on the floor in the tent The lights were on and I had a cold and damp
feeling and something wet was trickling down my neck

I seemed to be alone but in a second somebody came into the tent and I
saw it was Mr Harbison and that he had a double handful of halfmelted
snow He looked frantic and determined and only my sitting up quickly
prevented my getting another snow bath My neck felt queer and stiff
and I was very dizzy When he saw that I was conscious he dropped the
snow and stood looking down at me

Do you know he said grimly that I very nearly choked you to death a
little while ago

It wouldnt surprise me to be told so I said Do I know too much or
what is it Mr Harbison I felt terribly ill but I would not let him
see it It is queer isnt ithow we always select the roof for our
littledifferences He seemed to relax somewhat at my gibe

I didnt know it was you he explained shortly I was waiting
forsome one and in the hat you wore and the coat I mistook you
Thats all Can you stand

No I retorted I could but his summary manner displeased me The
sequel however was rather amazing for he stooped suddenly and picked
me up and the next instant we were out in the storm together At the
door he stooped and felt for the knob

Turn it he commanded I cant reach it

Ill do nothing of the kind I said shrewishly Let me down I can
walk perfectly well

He hesitated Then he slid me slowly to my feet but he did not open
the door at once Are you afraid to let me carry you down those stairs
afterTuesday night he asked very low You still think I did that

I had never been less sure of it than at that moment but an imp of
perversity made me retort Yes

He hardly seemed to hear me He stood looking down at me as I leaned
against the door frame

Good Lord he groaned To think that I might have killed you And
thenhe stooped and suddenly kissed me

The next moment the door was open and he was leading me down into the
house At the foot of the staircase he paused still holding my hand
and faced me in the darkness

Im not sorry he said steadily I suppose I ought to be but Im
not OnlyI want you to know that I was not guiltybefore I didnt
intend to now I amalmost as much surprised as you are

I was quite unable to speak but I wrenched my hand loose He stepped
back to let me pass and I went down the hall alone



Chapter XVIII ITS ALL MY FAULT

I didnt go to the drawing room again I went into my own room and sat
in the dark and tried to be furiously angry and only succeeded in
feeling queer and tingly One thing was absolutely certain not the same
man but two different men had kissed me on the stairs to the roof
It sounds rather horrid and discriminating but there was all the
difference in the world

But thenwho had And for whom had Mr Harbison been waiting on the
roof Did you know that I nearly choked you to death a few minutes
ago Then he rather expected to finish somebody in that way Who Jim
probably It was strange too but suddenly I realized that no matter
how many suspicious things I mustered up against himand there were
plentydown in my heart I didnt believe him guilty of anything except
this last and unforgivable offense Whoever was trying to leave the
house had taken the necklace that seemed clear unless Max was still
foolishly trying to break quarantine and create one of the sensations he
so dearly loves This was a new idea and some things upheld it but Max
had been playing bridge when I was kissed on the stairs and there was
still left that ridiculous incident of the comfort

Bella came up after I had gone to bed and turned on the light to brush
her hair

If I dont leave this mausoleum soon Ill be carried out she
declared You in bed Lollie Mercer and Dal flirting Anne hysterical
and Jim making his will in the den You will have to take Aunt Selina
tonight Kit Im all in

If youll put her to bed Ill keep her there I conceded after some
parley

Youre a dear Bella came back from the door Look here Kit you
know Jim pretty well Dont you think he looks ill Thinner

Hes a wreck I said soberly You have a lot to answer for Bella

Bella went over to the cheval glass and looked in it I avoid him all
I can she said posing Hes awfully funny hes so afraid Ill think
hes serious about you He cant realize that for me he simply doesnt
exist

Well I took Aunt Selina and about two oclock while I was in my first
sleep I woke to find her standing beside me tugging at my arm

Theres somebody in the house she whispered Thieves

If theyre in theyll not get out tonight I said

I tell you I saw a man skulking on the stairs she insisted

I got up ungraciously enough and put on my dressing gown Aunt Selina
who had her hair in crimps tied a veil over her head and together we
went to the head of the stairs Aunt Selina leaned far over and peered
down

Hes in the library she whispered I can see a light

The lust of battle was in Aunt Selinas eye She girded her robe about
her and began to descend the stairs cautiously We went through the hall
and stopped at the library door It was empty but from the den beyond
came a hum of voices and the cheerful glow of fire light I realized the
situation then but it was too late

Then why did you kiss her in the dining room Bella was saying in her
clear high tones You did didnt you

It was only her hand Jim desperately explaining Ive got to pay
her some attention under the circumstances And I give you my word I
was thinking of you when I did it THE WRETCH

Aunt Selina drew her breath in suddenly

I am thinking of marrying Reggie Wolfe This was Bella of course He
wants me to Hes a dear boy

If you do I will kill him

I am so very lonely Bella sighed We could hear the creak of Jims
shirt bosom that showed that he had sighed also Aunt Selina had gripped
me by the arm and I could hear her breathing hard beside me

Its only Jim I whispered II dont want to hear any more

But she clutched me firmly and the next thing we heard was another
creak louder and

Get up Get up off your knees this instant Bella was saying
frantically Some one might come in

Dont send me away Jim said in a smothered voice Every one in the
house is asleep and I love you dear

Aunt Selina swallowed hard in the darkness

You have no right to make love to me Bella Itsits highly
improper under the circumstances

And then Jim You swallow a camel and stick at a gnat Why did you meet
me here if you didnt expect me to make love to you Ive stood for
a lot Bella but this foolishness will have to end Either you love
meor you dont Im desperate He drew a long forlorn breath

Poor old Jim This was Bella A pause ThenLet my hand alone Also
Bella

It is MY handJims most fatuous tone THERE is where you wore
my ring Theres the mark still Sounds of Jim kissing Bellas ring
finger What did you do with it Throw it away More sounds

Aunt Selina crossed the library swiftly and again I followed Bella
was sitting in a low chair by the fire looking at the logs in the most
exquisite negligee of pink chiffon and ribbon Jim was on his knees
staring at her adoringly and holding both her hands

Ill tell you a secret Bella was saying looking as coy as she knew
howwhich was considerable II still wear it on a chain around my
neck

On a chain around her neck Bella who is decollete whenever it is
allowable and more than is proper

That was the limit of Aunt Selinas endurance Still holding me she
stepped through the doorway and into the firelight a fearful figure

Jim saw her first He went quite white and struggled to get up
smiling a sickly smile Bella after her first surprise was superbly
indifferent She glanced at us raised her eyebrows and then looked at
the clock

More victims of insomnia she said Wont you come in Jim pull up a
chair by the fire for your aunt

Aunt Selina opened her mouth twice like a fish before she could speak
Then

James I demand that that woman leave the house she said hoarsely

Bella leaned back and yawned

James shall I go she asked amiably

Nonsense Jim said pulling himself together as best he could Look
here Aunt Selina you know she cant go out and whats more Idont
want her to go

Youwhat Aunt Selina screeched taking a step forward You have the
audacity to say such a thing to me

Bella leaned over and gave the fire log a punch

I was just saying that he shouldnt say such things to me either
she remarked pleasantly Im afraid youll take cold Miss Caruthers
Wouldnt you like a hot sherry flip

Aunt Selina gasped Then she sat down heavily on one of the carved
teakwood chairs

He said he loved you I heard him she said weakly Hehe was going
to put his arm around you

Habit Jim put in trying to smile You see Aunt Selina itswell
its a habit I got into some time ago and Imy arm does it without my
thinking about it

Habit Aunt Selina repeated her voice thick with passion Then she
turned to me Go to your room at once she said in her most awful
tone Go to your room and leave thisthis shocking affair to me

But if she had reached her limit so had I If Jim chose to ruin
himself it was not my fault Any one with common sense would have known
at least to close the door before he went down on his knees no matter
to whom So when Aunt Selina turned on me and pointed in the direction
of the staircase I did not move

I am perfectly wide awake I said coldly I shall go to bed when I am
entirely ready and not before And as for Jims conduct I do not know
much about the conventions in such cases but if he wishes to embrace
Miss Knowles and she wants him to the situation is interesting but
hardly novel

Aunt Selina rose slowly and drew the folds of her dressing gown around
her away from the contamination of my touch

Do you know what you are saying she demanded hoarsely

I do I was quite white and stiff from my knees up but below I
was wavery I glanced at Jim for moral support but he was looking
idolatrously at Bella As for her quite suddenly she had dropped her
mask of indifference her face was strained and anxious and there were
deep circles I had not seen before under her eyes And it was Bella who
finally threw herself into the breachthe family breach

It is all my fault Miss Caruthers she said stepping between Aunt
Selina and myself I have been a blind and wicked woman and I have
almost wrecked two lives

Two What of mine

You see she struggled on against the glint in Aunt Selinas eyes
II did not realize how much I cared until it was too late I did so
many things that were cruel and wrongoh Jim Jim

She turned and buried her head on his shoulder and cried real tears I
could hardly believe that it was Bella And Jim put both his arms around
her and almost cried too and looked nauseatingly happy with the eye
he turned to Bella and scared to death out of the one he kept on Aunt
Selina

She turned on me as of course I knew she would

That she said pointing at Jim and Bella that shameful picture
is due to your own indifference I am not blind I have seen how you
rejected all his loving advances Bella drew away from Jim but
he jerked her back If anything in the world would reconcile me to
divorce it is this unbelievable situation James are you shameless

But James was and didnt care who knew it And as there was nothing else
to do and no one else to do it I stood very straight against the door
frame and told the whole miserable story from the very beginning I
told how Dal and Jim had persuaded me and how I had weakened and found
it was too late and how Bella had come in that night when she had no
business to come and had sat down in the basement kitchen on my hands
and almost turned me into a raving maniac As I went on I became fluent
my sense of injury grew on me I made it perfectly clear that I hated
them all and that when people got divorces they ought to know their own
minds and stay divorced And at that a great light broke on Aunt Selina
who hadnt understood until that minute

In view of her principles she might have been expected to turn on Jim
and Bella and disinherit them and cast them out figuratively with
the flaming sword of her tongue BUT SHE DID NOT

She turned on me in the most terrible way and asked me how I dared to
come between husband and wife because divorce or no divorce whom God
hath joined together and so on And when Jim picked up his courage in
both hands and tried to interfere she pushed him back with one hand
while she pointed the other at me and called me a Jezebel



Chapter XIX THE HARBISON MAN

She talked for an hour having got between me and the door and she
scolded Jim and Bella thoroughly But they did not hear it being
occupied with each other sitting side by side meekly on the divan with
Jim holding Bellas hand under a cushion She said they would have to be
very good to make up for all the deception but it was perfectly
clear that it was a relief to her to find that I didnt belong to her
permanently and as I have said before she was crazy about Bella

I sat back in a chair and grew comfortably drowsy in the monotony of her
voice It was a name that brought me to myself with a jerk

Mr Harbison Aunt Selina was saying Then bring him down at once
James I want no more deception There is no use cleaning a house and
leaving a dirty corner

It will not be necessary for me to stay and see it swept I said
mustering the rags she had left of my selfrespect and trying to pass
her But she planted herself squarely before me

You can not stir up a dust like this young woman and leave other
people to sneeze in it she said grimly And I stayed

I sat very small on a chair in a corner I felt like Jezebel or
whatever her name was and now the Harbison man was coming and he
was going to see me stripped of my pretensions to domesticity and of a
husband who neglected me He was going to see me branded a living lie
and he would hate me because I had put him in a ridiculous position He
was just the sort to resent being ridiculous

Jim brought him down in a dressing gown and a state of bewilderment
It was plain that the memory of the afternoon still rankled for he was
very short with Jim and inclined to resent the whole thing The clock
in the hall chimed half after three as they came down the stairs and I
heard Mr Harbison stumble over something in the darkness and say that
if it was a joke he wasnt in the humor for it To which Jim retorted
that it wasnt anything resembling a joke and for heavens sake not to
walk on his feet he couldnt get around the furniture any faster

At the door of the den Mr Harbison stopped blinking in the light
Then when he saw us he tried to back himself and his dishabille out
into the obscurity of the library But Aunt Selina was too quick for
him

Come in she called I want you young man It seems that there are
only two fools in the house and you are one

He straightened at that and looked bewildered but he tried to smile

I thought I was the only one he said Is it possible that there is
another

I am the other she announced I think she expected him to say
Impossible but whatever he was he was never banal

Is that so he asked politely trying to be interested and to
understand at the same time He had not seen me He was gazing fixedly
at Bella languishing on the divan and watching him with lowered lids
and he had given Jim a side glance of contempt But now he saw me and
he colored under his tan His neck blushed furiously being much whiter
than his face He kept his eyes on mine and I knew that he was mutely
asking forgiveness But the thought of what was coming paralyzed me My
eyes were glued to his as they had been that first evening when he had
called me Mrs Wilson and after an instant he looked away and his
face was set and hard

It seems that we have all been playing a little comedy Mr Harbison
Aunt Selina began nasally sarcastic Or rather you and I have been
the audience The rest have played

II dont think I understand he said slowly I have seen very
little comedy

It was not well planned Aunt Selina retorted tartly The idea
was good but the young person who was playing the part of Mrs
Wilsonoveracted

Oh come Aunt Selina Jim protested Kit was coaxed and cajoled into
this thing Give me fits if you like I deserve all I get But let Kit
aloneshe did it for me

Bella looked over at me and smiled nastily

I would stop doing things for Jim Kit she said It is SO
unprofitable

But Mr Harbison harked back to Aunt Selinas speech

PLAYING the part of Mrs Wilson he repeated Do you mean

Exactly Playing the part She is not Mrs Wilson It seems that that
honor belonged at one time to Miss Knowles I believe such things are
not unknown in New York only why in the name of sense does a man want
to divorce a woman and then meet her at two oclock in the morning to
kiss the place where his own wedding ring used to rest

Jim fidgeted Bella was having spasms of mirth to herself but the
Harbison man did not smile He stood for a moment looking at the fire
then he thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his dressing gown and
stalked over to me He did not care that the others were watching and
listening

Is it true he demanded staring down at me You are NOT Mrs Wilson
You are not married at all All that about being neglectedand loathing
HIM and all that on the roofthere was no foundation of truth

I could only shake my head without looking up There was no defense to
be made Oh I deserved the scorn in his voice

Theythey persuaded you I suppose and it was to help somebody It
was not a practical joke

No I rallied a little spirit at that It had been anything but a
joke

He drew a long breath

I think I understand he said slowly butyou could have saved me
something I must have given you all a great deal of amusement

Oh no I protested II want to tell you

But he deliberately left me and went over to the door There he turned
and looked down at Aunt Selina He was a little white but there was no
passion in his face

Thank you for telling me all this Miss Caruthers he said easily
Now that you and I know Im afraid the others will miss their little
diversion Good night

Oh it was all right for Jim to laugh and say that he was only huffed
a little and would be over it by morning I knew better There was
something queer in his face as he went out He did not even glance in my
direction He had said very little but he had put me as effectually in
the wrong as if he had not kissed medeliberately kissed methat very
evening on the roof

I did not go to sleep again I lay wretchedly thinking things over and
trying to remember who Jezebel was and toward morning I distinctly
heard the knob of the door turn I mistrusted my ears however and so
I got up quietly and went over in the darkness There was no sound
outside but when I put my hand on the knob I felt it move under my
fingers The counter pressure evidently alarmed whoever it was for the
knob was released and nothing more happened But by this time anything
so uncomplicated as the fumbling of a knob at night had no power to
disturb me I went back to bed



Chapter XX BREAKING OUT IN A NEW PLACE

Hunger roused everybody early the next morning Friday Leila Mercer had
discovered a box of bonbons that she had forgotten and we divided them
around Aunt Selina asked for the candied fruit and got itquite a
third of the box We gathered in the lower hall and on the stairs and
nibbled nauseating sweets while Mr Harbison examined the telephone

He did not glance in my direction Betty and Dal were helping him and
he seemed very cheerful Max sat with me on the stairs Mr Harbison had
just unscrewed the telephone box from the wall and was squinting into
it when Bella came downstairs It was her first appearance but as she
was always late nobody noticed When she stopped just above us on
the stairs however we looked up and she was holding to the rail and
trembling perceptibly

Mr Harbison will youcan you come upstairs she asked Her voice
was strained almost reedy and her lips were white

Mr Harbison stared up at her with the telephone box in his hands

Whyercertainly he said but unless its very important Id
like to fix this talking machine We want to make a food record

Id like to break a food record Max put in but Bella created a
diversion by sitting down suddenly on the stair just above us and
burying her face in her handkerchief

Jim is sick she said with a sob Hehe doesnt want anything to
eat and his head aches Hesaid for meto go away and let him die

Dal dropped the hammer immediately and Lollie Mercer sat petrified
with a bonbon halfway to her mouth For of course it was unexpected
finding sentiment of any kind in Bella and none of them knew about the
scene in the den in the small hours of the morning

Sick Aunt Selina said from a hall chair Sick Where

All over Bella quavered His poor head is hot and hes thirsty but
he doesnt want anything but water

Great Scott Dal said suddenly Suppose he shouldBella are you
telling us ALL his symptoms

Bella put down her handkerchief and got up From her position on the
stairs she looked down on us with something of her old haughty manner

If he is ill you may blame yourselves all of you she said cruelly
You taunted him with beingfat and laughed at him until he stopped
eating the things he should eat And he has been exercisingon the
roof until he has worn himself out And nowhe is ill Hehe has a
rash

Everybody jumped at that and we instinctively moved away from Bella
She was quite cold and scornful by that time

A rash Max exclaimed What sort of rash

I did not see it Bella said with dignity and turning she went up
the stairs

There was a great deal of excitement and nobody except Mr Harbison was
willing to go near Jim He went up at once with Bella while Max and Dal
sat cravenly downstairs and wondered if we would all take it and Anne
told about a man she knew who had it and was deaf and dumb and blind
when he recovered

Mr Harbison came down after a while and said that the rash was there
right enough and that Jim absolutely refused to be quarantined that he
insisted that he always got a rash from early strawberries and that if
he DID have anything since they were so touchy he hoped they would all
get it If they locked him in he would kick the door down

We had a long conference in the hall with Bella sitting redeyed and
objecting to every suggestion we made And finally we arranged to
shut Jim up in one of the servants bedrooms with a sheet wrung out of
disinfectant hung over the door Bella said she would sit outside in
the hall and read to him through the closed door so finally he gave
a grudging consent But he was in an awful humor Max and Dal put on
rubber gloves and helped him over and they said afterward that the way
he talked was fearful And there was a telephone in the maids room and
he kept asking for things every five minutes

When the doctor came he said it was too early to tell positively and he
ordered him liquid diet and said he would be back that evening

Whichthe diettakes me back to the famine After they had moved Jim
Mr Harbison went back to the telephone and found everything as it
should be So he followed the telephone wire and the rest followed him
I did not he had systematically ignored me all morning after having
dared to kiss me the night before And any other man I know after
looking at me the way he had looked a dozen times would have been at
least reasonably glad to find me free and unmarried But it was clear
that he was not I wondered if he was the kind of man who always makes
love to the other mans wife and runs like mad when she is left a widow
or gets a divorce

And just when I had decided that I hated him and that there was one man
I knew who would never make love to a woman whom he thought married and
then be very dignified and aloof when he found she wasnt I heard what
was wrong with the telephone wire

It had been cut Cut through with a pair of silver manicure scissors
from the dressing table in Bellas room where Aunt Selina slept The
wire had been clipped where it came into the house just under a window
and the scissors still lay on the sill

It was mysterious enough but no one was interested in the mystery just
then We wanted food and wanted it at once Mr Harbison fixed the
wire and the first thing we did of course was to order something to
eat Aunt Selina went to bed just after luncheon with indigestion to
the relief of every one in the house She had been most unpleasant all
morning

When she found herself ill however she insisted on having Bella and
that made trouble at once We found Bella with her cheek against the
door into Jims room looking maudlin while he shouted love messages to
her from the other side At first she refused to stir but after Anne
and Max had tried and failed the rest of us went to her in a body and
implored her We said Aunt Selina was in awful shapewhich she was as
to temperand that she had thrown a mustard plaster at Anne which was
true

So Bella went grumbling and Jim was a maniac We had not thought it
would be so bad for Bella but Aunt Selina fell asleep soon after she
took charge holding Bellas hand and slept for three hours and never
let go

About two that afternoon the sun came out and the rest of us went
to the roof The sleet had melted and the air was fairly warm Two
housemaids dusting rugs on the top of the next house came over and
stared at us and somebody in an automobile down on Riverside Drive
stood up and waved at us It was very cheerful and hopelessly lonely

I stayed on the roof after the others had gone and for some time I
thought I was alone After a while I got a whiff of smoke and then
I saw Mr Harbison far over in the corner one foot on the parapet
moodily smoking a pipe He was gazing out over the river and paying no
attention to me This was natural considering that I had hardly spoken
to him all day

I would not let him drive me away so I sat still and it grew darker
and colder He filled his pipe now and then but he never looked in my
direction Finally however as it grew very dusk he knocked the ashes
out and came toward me

I am going to make a request Miss McNair he said evenly Please
keep off the roof after sunset There arereasons I had risen and was
preparing to go downstairs

Unless I know the reasons I refuse to do anything of the kind I
retorted He bowed

Then the door will be kept locked he rejoined and opened it for me
He did not follow me but stood watching until I was down and I heard
him close the roof door firmly behind me



Chapter XXI A BAR OF SOAP

Late that evening Betty Mercer and Dallas were writing verses of
condolence to be signed by all of us and put under the door into Jims
room when Bella came running down the stairs

Dal was reading the first verse when she came Listen to this Bella
he said triumphantly

 There was a fat artist named Jas
 Who cruelly called his friends nas
 When altho shut up tight
 He broke out over night
 With a rash that is maddening he clas

Then he caught sight of Bellas face as she stood in the doorway and
stopped

Jim is delirious she announced tragically You shut him in there all
alone and now hes delirious Ill never forgive any of you

Delirious everybody exclaimed

He was sane enough when I took him his chicken broth Mr Harbison
said He was almost fluent

He is stark staring crazy Bella insisted hysterically II locked
the door carefully when I went down to my dinner and when I came up
itit was unlocked and Jim was babbling on the bed with a sheet over
his face Hehe says the house is haunted and he wants all the men to
come up and sit in the room with him

Not on your life Max said I am young and my career has only begun
I dont intend to be cut off in the flower of my youth But Ill tell
you what I will do Ill take him a drink I can tie it to a pole or
something

But Mr Harbison did not smile He was thoughtful for a minute Then

I dont believe he is delirious he said quietly and I wouldnt
be surprised if he has happened on something thatwill be of general
interest I think I will stay with him tonight

After that of course none of the others would confess that he was
afraid so with the South American leading they all went upstairs The
women of the party sat on the lower steps and listened but everything
was quiet Now and then we could hear the sound of voices and after
a while there was a rapid slamming of doors and the sound of some one
running down to the second floor Then quiet again

None of us felt talkative Bella had followed the men up and had been
put out and sat sniffling by herself in the den Aunt Selina was
working over a jigsaw puzzle in the library and declaring that some of
it must be lost Anne and Leila Mercer were embroidering and Betty and
I sat idle our hands in our laps The whole atmosphere of the house
was mysterious Anne told over again of the strange noises the night
her necklace was stolen Betty asked me about the time when the comfort
slipped from under my fingers And when in the midst of the story the
telephone rang we all jumped and shrieked

In an hour or so they sent for Flannigan and he went upstairs He came
down again soon however and returned with something over his arm that
looked like a rope It seemed to be made of all kinds of things tied
together trunk straps clothesline bed sheets and something that
Flannigan pointed to with rage and said he hadnt been able to keep his
clothes on all day He refused to explain further however and trailed
the nondescript article up the stairs We could only gaze after him and
wonder what it all meant

The conclave lasted far into the night The feminine contingent went to
bed but not to sleep Some time after midnight Mr Harbison and Max
went downstairs and I could hear them rattling around testing windows
and burglar alarms But finally every one settled down and the rest of
the night was quiet

Betty Mercer came into my room the next morning Sunday and said Anne
Brown wanted me I went over at once and Anne was sitting up in bed
crying Dal had slipped out of the room at daylight she said and
hadnt come back He had thought she was asleep but she wasnt and
she knew he was dead for nothing ever made Dal get up on Sunday before
noon

There was no one moving in the house and I hardly knew what to do It
was Betty who said she would go up and rouse Mr Harbison and Max who
had taken Jims place in the studio She started out bravely enough but
in a minute we heard her flying back Anne grew perfectly white

Hes lying on the upper stairs Betty cried and we all ran out It
was quite true Dal was lying on the stairs in a bathrobe with one of
Jims Indian war clubs in his hand And he was sound asleep

He looked somewhat embarrassed when he roused and saw us standing
around He said he was going to play a practical joke on somebody
and fell asleep in the middle of it And Anne said he wasnt even an
intelligent liar and went back to bed in a temper But Betty came in
with me and we sat and looked at each other and didnt say much The
situation was beyond us

The doctor let Jim out the next day there having been nothing the
matter with him but a stomach rash But Jim was changed he mooned
around Bella of course as before but he was abstracted at times and
all that daySundayhe wandered off by himself and one would come
across him unexpectedly in the basement or along some of the unused back
halls

Aunt Selina held service that morning Jim said that he always had a
prayer book but that he couldnt find anything with so many people
in the house So Aunt Selina read some religious poetry out of the
newspapers and gave us a valuable talk on Deception versus Honesty
with me as the illustration

Almost everybody took a nap after luncheon I stayed in the den and read
Ibsen and felt very mournful And after Hedda had shot herself I lay
down on the divan and cried a littleover Hedda she was young and it
was such a tragic endingand then I fell asleep

When I wakened Mr Harbison was standing by the table and he held
my book in his hands In view of the armed neutrality between us I
expected to see him bow to me curtly turn on his heel and leave the
room Indeed considering his state of mind the night before I should
hardly have been surprised if he had thrown Hedda at my head This is
not a pun I detest them But instead when he heard me move he glanced
over at me and even smiled a little

She wasnt worth it he said indicating the book

Worth what

Your tears You were crying over it werent you

She was very unhappy I asserted indifferently She was married and
she loved some one else

Do you really think she did he asked And even so was that a
reason

The other man cared for her he may not have been able to help it

But he knew that she was married he said virtuously and then he
caught my eye and he saw the analogy instantly for he colored hotly and
put down the book

Most men argue that way I said They argue by the book andthey do
as they like

He picked up a Japanese ivory paper weight from the table and stood
balancing it across his finger

You are perfectly right he said at last I deserve it all My
grievance is at myself Youryour beauty and the fact that I thought
you were unhappy put mebeside myself It is not an excuse it is a
weak explanation I will not forget myself again

He was as abject as any one could have wished It was my minute of
triumph but I can not pretend that I was happy Evidently it had been
only a passing impulse If he had really cared now that he knew I
was free he would have forgotten himself again at once Then a new
explanation occurred to me Suppose it had been Bella all the time and
the real shock had been to find that she had been married

The fault of the situation was really mine I said magnanimously
I quite blame myself Only you must believe one thing You never
furnished us any amusement I looked at him sidewise The discovery
that Bella and Jim were once married must have been a great shock

It was a surprise he replied evenly His voice and his eyes were
inscrutable He returned my glance steadily It was infuriating to have
gone halfway to meet him as I had and then to find him intrenched in
his selfsufficiency again I got up

It is unfortunate that our acquaintance has begun so unfavorably I
remarked preparing to pass him Under other circumstances we might
have been friends

There is only one solace he said When we do not have friends we
can not lose them

He opened the door to let me pass out and as our eyes met all the
coldness died out of his He held out his hand but I was hurt I
refused to see it

Kit he said unsteadily IIm an obstinate pigheaded brute I am
sorry Cant we be friends after all

When we do not have friends we can not lose them I replied with
cool malice And the next instant the door closed behind me

It was that night that the really serious event of the quarantine
occurred

We were gathered in the library and everybody was deadly dull Aunt
Selina said she had been reared to a strict observance of the Sabbath
and she refused to go to bed early The cards and card tables were put
away and every one sat around and quarreled and was generally nasty
except Bella and Jim who had gone into the den just after dinner and
firmly closed the door

I think it was just after Max proposed to me Yes he proposed to me
again that night He said that Jims illness had decided him that any
of us might take sick and die shut in that contaminated atmosphere and
that if he did he wanted it all settled And whether I took him or not
he wanted me to remember him kindly if anything happened I really
hated to refuse himhe was in such deadly earnest But it was quite
unnecessary for him to have blamed his refusal as he did on Mr
Harbison I am sure I had refused him plenty of times before I had
ever heard of the man Yes it was just after he proposed to me that
Flannigan came to the door and called Mr Harbison out into the hall

Flanniganlike most of the people in the housealways went to Mr
Harbison when there was anything to be done He openly adored him
andwhat was morehe did what Mr Harbison ordered without a word
while the rest of us had to get down on our knees and beg

Mr Harbison went out muttering something about a storm coming up and
seeing that the tent was secure Betty Mercer went with him She had
been at his heels all evening and called him Tom on every possible
occasion Indeed she made no secret of it she said that she was mad
about him and that she would love to live in South America and have
an Indian squaw for a ladys maid and sit out on the veranda in the
evenings and watch the Southern Cross shooting across the sky and eat
tropical food from the quaint Indian pottery She was not even daunted
when Dal told her the Southern Cross did not shoot and that the food
was probably canned corn on tin dishes

So Betty went with him She wore a pale yellow dinner gown with just a
sophisticated touch of black here and there and cut modestly square in
the neck Her shoulders are scrawny And after they were gonenot her
shoulders Mr Harbison and sheAunt Selina announced that the next day
was Monday that she had only a weeks supply of clothing with her and
that no policeman who ever swung a mace should wash her undergarments
for her

She paused a moment but nobody offered to do it Anne was reading De
Maupassant under cover of a table and the rest pretended not to hear
After a pause Aunt Selina got up heavily and went upstairs coming down
soon after with a bundle covered with a green shawl and with a white
balbriggan stocking trailing from an opening in it She paused at the
library door surveyed the inmates caught my unlucky eye and beckoned
to me with a relentless forefinger

We can put them to soak tonight she confided to me and tomorrow
they will be quite simple to do There is no lace to speak ofDal
raised his eyebrowsand very little flouncing

Aunt Selina and I went to the laundry It never occurred to any one that
Bella should have gone she had stepped into all my privilegessuch as
they wereand assumed none of my obligations Aunt Selina and I went to
the laundry

It is strange what big things develop from little ones In this case it
was a bar of soap And if Flannigan had used as much soap as he should
have instead of washing up the kitchen floor with cold dish water it
would have developed sooner The two most unexpected events of the whole
quarantine occurred that night at the same time one on the roof and one
in the cellar The cellar one although curious was not so serious as
the other so it comes first

Aunt Selina put her clothes in a tub in the laundry and proceeded
to dress them like a vegetable She threw in a handful of salt some
kerosene oil and a little ammonia The result was villainous but after
she tasted itor snuffed itshe said it needed a bar of soap cut up to
give it strengthor flavorand I went into the store room for it

The laundry soap was in a box I took in a silver fork for I hated to
touch the stuff and jabbed a bar successfully in the semidarkness
Then I carried it back to the laundry and dropped it on the table Aunt
Selina looked at the fork with disgust then we both looked at the soap
ONE SIDE OF IT WAS COVERED WITH ROUND HOLES THAT CURVED AROUND ON EACH
OTHER LIKE A COILED SNAKE

I ran back to the store room and there a little bit sticky and
smelling terribly of rosin lay Annes pearl necklace

I was so excited that I seized Aunt Selina by the hands and danced her
all over the place Then I left her trying to find her hair pins on the
floor and ran up to tell the others I met Betty in the hall and waved
the pearls at her But she did not notice them

Is Mr Harbison down there she asked breathlessly I left him on the
roof and went down to my room for my scarf and when I went back he
had disappeared Hehe doesnt seem to be in the house She tried
to laugh but her voice was shaky He couldnt have got down without
passing me anyhow she supplemented I suppose Im silly but so many
queer things have happened Kit

I wouldnt worry Betty I soothed her He is big enough to take care
of himself And with the best intentions in the world you cant have
him all the time you know

She was too much startled to be indignant She followed me into the
library where the sight of the pearls produced a tremendous excitement
and then every one had to go down to the store room and see where the
necklace had been hidden and Max examined all the bars of soap for
thumb prints

Mr Harbison did not appear Max commented on the fact caustically
but Dal hushed him up And so Anne hugging her pearls and Aunt Selina
having put a final seasoning of washing powder on the clothes in the
tub we all went upstairs to bed It had been a long day and the
morning would at least bring bridge

I was almost ready for bed when Jim tapped at my door I had been very
cool to him since the night in the library when I was publicly staked
and martyred and he was almost cringing when I opened the door

What is it now I asked cruelly Has Bella tired of it already or
has somebody else a rash

Dont be a shrew Kit he said I dont want you to do anything I
onlywhen did you see Harbison last

If you mean last I retorted Im afraid I havent seen the last of
him yet Then I saw that he was really worried Betty was leading him
to the roof I added Why Is he missing

He isnt anywhere in the house Dal and I have been over every inch
of it Max had come up in a dressing gown and was watching me
insolently

I think we have seen the last of him he said Im sorry Kit to nip
the little romance in the bud The fellow was crazy about youtheres
no doubt of it But Ive been watching him from the beginning and I
think Im upheld Whether he went down the water spout or across a
board to the next house

II dislike him intensely I said angrily but you would not dare to
say that to his face He could strangle you with one hand

Max laughed disagreeably

Well I only hope he is gone he threw at me over his shoulder I
wouldnt want to be responsible to your father if he had stayed I was
speechless with wrath

They went away then and I could hear them going over the house At
one oclock Jim went up to bed the last and Mr Harbison had not been
found I did not see how they could go to bed at all If he had escaped
then Max was right and the whole thing was heartbreaking And if he had
not then he might be lying

I got up and dressed

The early part of the night had been cloudy but when I got to the roof
it was clear starlight The wind blew through the electric wires
strung across and set them singing The occasional bleat of a belated
automobile on the drive below came up to me raucously The tent gleamed
a starlit ghost of itself and the boxwoods bent in the breeze I went
over to the parapet and leaned my elbows on it I had done the
same thing so often before I had carried all my times of stress so
infallibly to that particular place that instinctively my feet turned
there

And there in the starlight I went over the whole seriocomedy and I
loathed my part in it He had been perfectly right to be angry with me
and with all of us And I had been a hypocrite and a Pharisee and had
thanked God that I was not as other people when the fact was that I was
worse than the worst And although it wasnt dignified to think of him
going down the drain pipe stillno one could blame him for wanting to
get away from us and he was quite muscular enough to do it

I was in the depths of selfabasement when I heard a sound behind me It
was a long breath quite audible that ended in a groan I gripped the
parapet and listened while my heart pounded and in a minute it came
again

I was terribly frightened ThenI dont know how I did it but I was
across the roof kneeling beside the tent where it stood against
the chimney And there lying prone among the flower pots and almost
entirely hidden lay the man we had been looking for

His head was toward me and I reached out shakingly and touched his
face It was cold and my hand when I drew it back was covered with
blood



Chapter XXII IT WAS DELIRIUM

I was sure he was dead He did not move and when I caught his hands and
called him frantically he did not hear me And so with the horror over
me I half fell down the stairs and roused Jim in the studio

They all came with lights and blankets and they carried him into the
tent and put him on the couch and tried to put whisky in his mouth But
he could not swallow And the silence became more and more ominous until
finally Anne got hysterical and cried He is dead Dead and collapsed
on the roof

But he was not Just as the lights in the tent began to have red rings
around them and Jims voice came from away across the river somebody
said There he swallowed that and soon after he opened his eyes He
muttered something that sounded like Andean pinnacle and lapsed into
unconsciousness again But he was not dead He was not dead

When the doctor came they made a stretcher out of one of Jims sixfoot
canvasesit had a picture on it and Jim was angry enough the next
dayand took him down to the studio We made it as much like a
sickroom as we could and we tried to make him comfortable But he lay
without opening his eyes and at dawn the doctor brought a consultant
and a trained nurse

The nurse was an offensively capable person She put us all out and
scolded Anne for lighting Japanese incense in the roomalthough Anne
explained that it is very reviving And she said that it was unnecessary
to have a dozen people breathing up all the oxygen and asphyxiating
the patient She was goodlooking too I disliked her at once Any
one could see by the way she took his pulsejust letting his poor hand
hang without any supportthat she was a purely mechanical creature
without heart

Well as I said before she put us all out and shut the door and asked
us not to whisper outside Then too she refused to allow any flowers
in the room although Betty had got a florist out of bed to order some

The consultant came stayed an hour and left Aunt Selina who proved
herself a trump in that trying time waylaid him in the hall and
he said it might be a fractured skull although it was possibly only
concussion

The men spent most of the morning together in the den with the door
shut Now and then one of them would tiptoe upstairs ask the nurse how
her patient was doing and creak down again Just before noon they all
went to the roof and examined again the place where he had been found
I know for I was in the upper hall outside the studio I stayed there
almost all day and after a while the nurse let me bring her things as
she needed them I dont know why mother didnt let me study nursingI
always wanted to do it And I felt helpless and childish now when there
were things to be done

Max came down from the roof alone and I cornered him in the upper hall

Im going crazy Max I said Nobody will tell me anything and I
cant stand it How was he hurt Who hurt him

Max looked at me quite a long time

Im darned if I understand you Kit he said gravely You said you
disliked Harbison

So I doI did I supplemented But whether I like him or not has
nothing to do with it He has been injuredperhaps murderedI choked
a little Whichwhich of you did it

Max took my hand and held it looking down at me

I wish you could have cared for me like that he said gently Dear
little girl we dont know who hurt him I didnt if thats what you
mean Perhaps a flower pot

I began to cry then and he drew me to him and let me cry on his arm He
stood very quietly patting my head in a brotherly way and behaving very
well save that once he said

Dont cry too long Kit I can stand only a certain amount

And just then the nurse opened the door to the studio and with Maxs
arm still around me I raised my head and looked in

Mr Harbison was conscious His eyes were open and he was staring at us
both as we stood framed by the doorway

He lay back at once and closed his eyes and the nurse shut the door
There was no use even if I had been allowed in in trying to explain
to him To attempt such a thing would have been to presume that he was
interested in an explanation I thought bitterly to myself as I brought
the nurse cracked ice and struggled to make beef tea in the kitchen
that lives had been wrecked on less

Dal was allowed ten minutes in the sick room during the afternoon and
he came out looking puzzled and excited He refused to tell us what he
had learned however and the rest of the afternoon he and Jim spent in
the cellar

The day dragged on Downstairs people ate and read and wrote letters
and outside newspaper men talked together and gazed over at the house
and photographed the doctors coming in and the doctors going out As for
me in the intervals of bringing things I sat in Bellas chair in the
upper hall and listened to the crackle of the nurses starched skirts

At midnight that night the doctors made a thorough examination When
they came out they were smiling

He is doing very well the younger one saidhe was hairy and dark
but he was beautiful to me He is entirely conscious now and in about
an hour you can send the nurse off for a little sleep Dont let him
talk

And so at last I went through the familiar door into an unfamiliar room
with basins and towels and bottles around and a screen made of Jims
largest canvases And someone on the improvised bed turned and looked
at me He did not speak and I sat down beside him After a while he put
his hand over mine as it lay on the bed

You are much better to me than I deserve he said softly And because
his eyes were disconcerting I put an ice cloth over them

Much better than you deserve I said and patted the ice cloth to
place gently He fumbled around until he found my hand again and we
were quiet for a long time I think he dozed for he roused suddenly and
pulled the cloth from his eyes

Thethe day is all confused he said turning to look at me
butone thing seems to stand out from everything else Perhaps it
was delirium but I seemed to see that door over there open and you
outside withwith Max His arms were around you

It was delirium I said softly It was my final lie in that house of
mendacity

He drew a satisfied breath and lifting my hand held it to his lips and
kissed it

I can hardly believe it is you he said I have to hold firmly to
your hand or you will disappear Cant you move your chair closer You
are miles away So I did it for he was not to be excited

After a little

Its awfully good of you to do this I have been desperately sorry
Kit about the other night It was a ruffianly thing to doto kiss you
when I thought

You are to keep very still I reminded him He kissed my hand again
but he persisted

I was madcrazy I tried to give him some medicine but he pushed the
spoon aside You will have to listen he said I am in the depths of
selfdisgust II cant think of anything else You see you seemed
so convinced that I was the blackguard that somehow nothing seemed to
matter

I have forgotten it all I declared generously and I would be quite
willing to be friends only you remember you said

Friends his voice was suddenly reckless and he raised on his elbow
Friends Who wants to be friends Kit I was almost delirious that
night The instant I held you in my armsIt was all over I loved you
the first time I saw you II suppose Im a fool to talk like this

And of course just then Dallas had to open the door and step into the
room He was covered with dirt and he had a hatchet in his hand

A rope he demanded without paying any attention to us and diving
into corners of the room Good heavens isnt there a rope in this
confounded house

He turned and rushed out without any explanation and left us staring
at the door

Bother the rope I found myself forced to look into two earnest eyes
Kit were you VERY angry when I kissed you that night on the roof

Very I maintained stoutly

Then prepare yourself for another attack of rage he said And Betty
opened the door

She had on a fetching pale blue dressing gown and one braid of her
yellow hair was pulled carelessly over her shoulder When she saw me
on my knees beside the bed oh yes I forgot to say that quite
unconsciously I had slid into that position she stopped short just
inside the door and put her hand to her throat She stood for quite a
perceptible time looking at us and I tried to rise But Tom shamelessly
put his arm around my shoulders and held me beside him Then Betty
took a step back and steadied herself by the door frame She had really
cared I knew then but I was too excited to be sorry for her

II beg your pardon for coming in she said nervously Butthey
want you downstairs Kit At least I thought you would want to go
butperhaps

Just then from the lower part of the house came a pandemonium of noises
women screaming men shouting and the sound of hatchet strokes and
splintering wood I seized Betty by the arm and together we rushed down
the stairs



Chapter XXIII COMING

The second floor was empty A table lay overturned at the top of the
stairs and a broken flower vase was weltering in its own ooze Part way
down Betty stepped on something sharp that proved to be the Japanese
paper knife from the den I left her on the stairs examining her foot
and hurried to the lower floor

Here everything was in the utmost confusion Aunt Selina had fainted
and was sitting in a hall chair with her head rolled over sidewise and
the poker from the library fireplace across her knees No one was paying
any attention to her And Jim was holding the front door open while
three of the guards hesitated in the vestibule The noises continued
from the back of the house and as I stood on the lowest stair Bella
came out from the dining room with her face streaked with soot and
carrying a kettle of hot water

Jim she called wildly While Max and Dal are below you can pour
this down from the top Its boiling

Jim glanced back over his shoulder Carry out your own murderous
designs he said And then as she started back with it Bella for
Heavens sake he called have you gone stark mad Put that kettle
down

She did it sulkily and Jim turned to the policeman

Yes I know it was a false alarm before he explained patiently but
this is genuine It is just as I tell you Yes Flannigan is in the
house somewhere but hes hiding I guess We could manage the thing
very well ourselves but we have no cartridges for our revolvers Then
as the noise from the rear redoubled If you dont come in and help I
will telephone for the fire department he concluded emphatically

I ran to Aunt Selina and tried to straighten her head In a moment she
opened her eyes sat up and stared around her She saw the kettle at
once

What are you doing with boiling water on the floor she said to me
with her returning voice Dont you know you will spoil the floor The
ruling passion was strong with Aunt Selina as usual

I could not find out the trouble from any one people appeared and
disappeared carrying strange articles Anne with a rope Dal with his
hatchet Bella and the kettle but I could get a coherent explanation
from no one When the guards finally decided that Jim was in earnest
and that the rest of us were not crawling out a rear window while he
held them at the door they came in three of them and two reporters
and Jim led them to the butlers pantry

Here we found Anne very white and shaky with the pantry table and two
chairs piled against the door of the kitchen slide and clutching the
chamoisskin bag that held her jewels She had a bottle of burgundy open
beside her and was pouring herself a glass with shaking hands when we
appeared She was furious at Jim

I very nearly fainted she said hysterically I might have been
murdered and no one would have cared I wish they would stop that
chopping Im so nervous I could scream

Jim took the Burgundy from her with one hand and pointed the police to
the barricaded door with the other

That is the door to the dumbwaiter shaft he said The lower one
is fastened on the inside in some manner The noises commenced about
eleven oclock while Mr Brown was on guard There were scraping sounds
first and later the sound of a falling body He roused Mr Reed and
myself but when we examined the shaft everything was quiet and dark
We tried lowering a candle on a string butit was extinguished from
below

The reporters were busily removing the table and chairs from the door

If you have a rope handy one of them said I will go down the
shaft

Dal says that all reporters should have been policemen and that all
policemen are natural newsgatherers

The cage appears to be stuck halfway between the floors Jim said
They are cutting through the door in the kitchen below

They opened the door then and cautiously peered down but there was
nothing to be seen I touched Jim gingerly on the arm

Is itis it Flannigan I asked shut in there

NoyesI dont know he returned absently Run along and dont
bother Kit He may take to shooting any minute

Anne and I went out then and shut the door and went into the dining
room and sat on our feet for of course the bullets might come up
through the floor Aunt Selina joined us there and Bella and the
Mercer girls and we sat around and talked in whispers and Leila Mercer
told of the time her grandfather had had a struggle with an escaped
lunatic

In the midst of the excitement Tom appeared in a bathrobe looking
very pale with a bandage around his head and the nurse at his heels
threatening to leave and carrying a bottle of medicine and a spoon He
went immediately to the pantry and soon we could hear him giving orders
and the rest hurrying around to obey them The hammering ceased and the
silence was even worse It was more suggestive

In about fifteen minutes there was a thud as if the cage had fallen
and the sound of feet rushing down the cellar stairs Then there were
groans and loud oaths and everybody talking at once below and the
sound of a struggle In the dining room we all sat bent forward with
straining ears and quickened breath until we distinctly heard someone
laugh Then we knew that whatever it was it was over and nobody was
killed

The sounds came closer were coming up the stairs and into the pantry
Then the door swung open and Tom and a policeman appeared in the
doorway with the others crowding behind Between them they supported
a grimy unshaven object covered with whitewash from the wall of the
shaft an object that had its hands fastened together with handcuffs
and that leered at us with a pair of the most villainously crossed eyes
I have ever seen

None of us had ever seen him before

Mr Lawrence McGuirk better known as Tubby Tom said cheerfully
A celebrity in his particular line which is secondstory man and
allround rascal A victim of the quarantine like ourselves

Weve missed him for a week one of the guards said with a grin
Weve been real anxious about you Tubby Aint a week goes by when
youre in health that we dont hear something of you

Mr McGuirk muttered something under his breath and the men chuckled

It seems Tom said interpreting that he doesnt like us much He
doesnt like the food and he doesnt like the beds He says just when
he got a good place fixed up in the coal cellar Flannigan found it and
is asleep there now this minute

Aunt Selina rose suddenly and cleared her throat

Am I to understand she asked severely that from now on we will have
to add two newspaper reporters three policemen and a burglar to the
occupants of this quarantined house Because if that is the case I
absolutely refuse to feed them

But one of the reporters stepped forward and bowed ceremoniously

Madam he said I thank you for your kind invitation butit will
be impossible for us to accept I had intended to break the good news
earlier but this little game of burglarinacorner prevented me The
fact is your Jap has been discovered to have nothing more serious than
chickenpox andif you will forgive a poultry yard joke there is no
longer any necessity for your being cooped up

Then he retired quite pleased with himself

One would have thought we had exhausted our capacity for emotion but
Jim said a joyful emotion was so new that we hardly knew how to receive
it Every one shook hands with every one else and even the nurse shared
in the excitement and gave Jim the medicine she had prepared for Tom

Then we all sat down and had some champagne and while they were waiting
for the police wagon they gave some to poor McGuirk He was still quite
shaken from his experience when the dumbwaiter stuck The wine cheered
him a little and he told his story in a voice that was creaky from
disuse while Tom held my hand under the table

He had had a dreadful week he said he spent his days in a closet in
one of the maids roomsthe one where we had put Jim It was Jim waking
out of a nap and declaring that the closet door had moved by itself and
that something had crawled under his bed and out of the door that had
roused the suspicions of the men in the houseand he slept at night on
the coal in the cellar He was actually tearful when he rubbed his hand
over his scrubby chin and said he hadnt had a shave for a week He
took somebodys razor he said but he couldnt get hold of a portable
mirror and every time he lathered up and stood in front of the glass in
the dining room sideboard some one came and he had had to run and hide
He told too of his attempts to escape of the board on the roof of
the homemade rope and the hole in the cellar and he spoke feelingly
of the pearl collar and the struggle he had made to hide it He said
that for three days it was concealed in the pocket of Jims old smoking
coat in the studio

We were all rather sorry for him but if we had made him uncomfortable
think of what he had done to us And for him to tell as he did later in
court that if that was high society he would rather be a burglar and
that we starved him and that the women had to dress each other because
they had no ladys maids and that the whole lot of us were in love with
one man it was downright malicious

The wagon came for him just as he finished his story and we all went
to the door In the vestibule Aunt Selina suddenly remembered something
and she stepped forward and caught the poor fellow by the arm

Young man she said grimly Ill thank you to return what you took
from ME last Tuesday night

McGuirk stared then shuddered and turned suddenly pale

Good Lord he ejaculated On the stairs to the roof YOU

They led him away then quite broken with Aunt Selina staring after
him She never did understand I could have explained but it was too
awful

On the steps McGuirk turned and took a farewell glance at us Then he
waved his hand to the policemen and reporters who had gathered around

Goodby fellows he called feebly I aint sorry I aint Jailll be
a paradise after this

And then we went to pack our trunks

NOTE FROM MAX WHICH CAME THE NEXT DAY WITH ITS ENCLOSURE

My Dear KitThe enclosed trunk tag was used on my trunk evidently by
mistake Higgins discovered it when he was unpacking and returned it
to me under the misapprehension that I had written it I wish I had I
suppose there must be something attractive about a fellow who has the
courage to write a love letter on the back of a trunk tag and who
doesnt give a tinkers damn who finds it But for my peace of mind ask
him not to leave another one around where I will come across it Max

WRITTEN ON THE BACK OF THE TRUNK TAG

Dont you know that I wont see you until tomorrow For Heavens sake
get away from this crowd and come into the den If you dont I will kiss
you before everybody Are you coming T
