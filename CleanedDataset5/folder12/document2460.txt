THE MADONNA OF THE FUTURE
by Henry James


We had been talking about the masters who had achieved but a single
masterpiecethe artists and poets who but once in their lives had known
the divine afflatus and touched the high level of perfection Our host
had been showing us a charming little cabinet picture by a painter whose
name we had never heard and who after this single spasmodic bid for
fame had apparently relapsed into obscurity and mediocrity There was
some discussion as to the frequency of this phenomenon during which I
observed H sat silent finishing his cigar with a meditative air and
looking at the picture which was being handed round the table I dont
know how common a case it is he said at last but I have seen it I
have known a poor fellow who painted his one masterpiece andhe added
with a smilehe didnt even paint that He made his bid for fame and
missed it We all knew H for a clever man who had seen much of men
and manners and had a great stock of reminiscences Some one
immediately questioned him further and while I was engrossed with the
raptures of my neighbour over the little picture he was induced to tell
his tale If I were to doubt whether it would bear repeating I should
only have to remember how that charming woman our hostess who had left
the table ventured back in rustling rosecolour to pronounce our
lingering a want of gallantry and finding us a listening circle sank
into her chair in spite of our cigars and heard the story out so
graciously that when the catastrophe was reached she glanced across at
me and showed me a tear in each of her beautiful eyes

    

It relates to my youth and to Italy two fine things H began I
had arrived late in the evening at Florence and while I finished my
bottle of wine at supper had fancied that tired traveller though I was
I might pay the city a finer compliment than by going vulgarly to bed A
narrow passage wandered darkly away out of the little square before my
hotel and looked as if it bored into the heart of Florence I followed
it and at the end of ten minutes emerged upon a great piazza filled
only with the mild autumn moonlight Opposite rose the Palazzo Vecchio
like some huge civic fortress with the great belltower springing from
its embattled verge as a mountainpine from the edge of a cliff At its
base in its projected shadow gleamed certain dim sculptures which I
wonderingly approached One of the images on the left of the palace
door was a magnificent colossus shining through the dusky air like a
sentinel who has taken the alarm In a moment I recognised him as
Michael Angelos _David_ I turned with a certain relief from his
sinister strength to a slender figure in bronze stationed beneath the
high light loggia which opposes the free and elegant span of its arches
to the dead masonry of the palace a figure supremely shapely and
graceful gentle almost in spite of his holding out with his light
nervous arm the snaky head of the slaughtered Gorgon His name is
Perseus and you may read his story not in the Greek mythology but in
the memoirs of Benvenuto Cellini Glancing from one of these fine
fellows to the other I probably uttered some irrepressible commonplace
of praise for as if provoked by my voice a man rose from the steps of
the loggia where he had been sitting in the shadow and addressed me in
good Englisha small slim personage clad in a sort of black velvet
tunic as it seemed and with a mass of auburn hair which gleamed in
the moonlight escaping from a little mediaeval birretta In a tone of
the most insinuating deference he asked me for my impressions He
seemed picturesque fantastic slightly unreal Hovering there in this
consecrated neighbourhood he might have passed for the genius of
aesthetic hospitalityif the genius of aesthetic hospitality were not
commonly some shabby little custode flourishing a calico
pockethandkerchief and openly resentful of the divided franc This
analogy was made none the less complete by the brilliant tirade with
which he greeted my embarrassed silence

I have known Florence long sir but I have never known her so lovely as
tonight Its as if the ghosts of her past were abroad in the empty
streets The present is sleeping the past hovers about us like a dream
made visible Fancy the old Florentines strolling up in couples to pass
judgment on the last performance of Michael of Benvenuto We should
come in for a precious lesson if we might overhear what they say The
plainest burgher of them in his cap and gown had a taste in the matter
That was the prime of art sir The sun stood high in heaven and his
broad and equal blaze made the darkest places bright and the dullest eyes
clear We live in the evening of time We grope in the gray dusk
carrying each our poor little taper of selfish and painful wisdom
holding it up to the great models and to the dim idea and seeing nothing
but overwhelming greatness and dimness The days of illumination are
gone But do you know I fancyI fancyand he grew suddenly almost
familiar in this visionary fervourI fancy the light of that time rests
upon us here for an hour I have never seen the David so grand the
Perseus so fair Even the inferior productions of John of Bologna and of
Baccio Bandinelli seem to realise the artists dream I feel as if the
moonlit air were charged with the secrets of the masters and as if
standing here in religious attention we mightwe might witness a
revelation Perceiving at this moment I suppose my halting
comprehension reflected in my puzzled face this interesting rhapsodist
paused and blushed Then with a melancholy smile You think me a
moonstruck charlatan I suppose Its not my habit to bang about the
piazza and pounce upon innocent tourists But tonight I confess I am
under the charm And then somehow I fancied you too were an artist

I am not an artist I am sorry to say as you must understand the term
But pray make no apologies I am also under the charm your eloquent
remarks have only deepened it

If you are not an artist you are worthy to be one he rejoined with an
expressive smile A young man who arrives at Florence late in the
evening and instead of going prosaically to bed or hanging over the
travellers book at his hotel walks forth without loss of time to pay
his devoirs to the beautiful is a young man after my own heart

The mystery was suddenly solved my friend was an American He must have
been to take the picturesque so prodigiously to heart None the less
so I trust I answered if the young man is a sordid New Yorker

New Yorkers have been munificent patrons of art he answered urbanely

For a moment I was alarmed Was this midnight reverie mere Yankee
enterprise and was he simply a desperate brother of the brush who had
posted himself here to extort an order from a sauntering tourist But
I was not called to defend myself A great brazen note broke suddenly
from the faroff summit of the belltower above us and sounded the first
stroke of midnight My companion started apologised for detaining me
and prepared to retire But he seemed to offer so lively a promise of
further entertainment that I was indisposed to part with him and
suggested that we should stroll homeward together He cordially
assented so we turned out of the Piazza passed down before the statued
arcade of the Uffizi and came out upon the Arno What course we took I
hardly remember but we roamed slowly about for an hour my companion
delivering by snatches a sort of moontouched aesthetic lecture I
listened in puzzled fascination and wondered who the deuce he was He
confessed with a melancholy but allrespectful headshake to his American
origin

We are the disinherited of Art he cried We are condemned to be
superficial We are excluded from the magic circle The soil of
American perception is a poor little barren artificial deposit Yes we
are wedded to imperfection An American to excel has just ten times as
much to learn as a European We lack the deeper sense We have neither
taste nor tact nor power How should we have them Our crude and
garish climate our silent past our deafening present the constant
pressure about us of unlovely circumstance are as void of all that
nourishes and prompts and inspires the artist as my sad heart is void of
bitterness in saying so We poor aspirants must live in perpetual
exile

You seem fairly at home in exile I answered and Florence seems to me
a very pretty Siberia But do you know my own thought Nothing is so
idle as to talk about our want of a nutritive soil of opportunity of
inspiration and all the rest of it The worthy part is to do something
fine There is no law in our glorious Constitution against that Invent
create achieve No matter if you have to study fifty times as much as
one of these What else are you an artist for Be you our Moses I
added laughing and laying my hand on his shoulder and lead us out of
the house of bondage

Golden wordsgolden words young man he cried with a tender smile
Invent create achieve Yes thats our business I know it well
Dont take me in Heavens name for one of your barren
complainersimpotent cynics who have neither talent nor faith I am at
workand he glanced about him and lowered his voice as if this were a
quite peculiar secretIm at work night and day I have undertaken a
_creation_ I am no Moses I am only a poor patient artist but it would
be a fine thing if I were to cause some slender stream of beauty to flow
in our thirsty land Dont think me a monster of conceit he went on
as he saw me smile at the avidity with which he adopted my illustration
I confess that I am in one of those moods when great things seem
possible This is one of my nervous nightsI dream waking When the
south wind blows over Florence at midnight it seems to coax the soul from
all the fair things locked away in her churches and galleries it comes
into my own little studio with the moonlight and sets my heart beating
too deeply for rest You see I am always adding a thought to my
conception This evening I felt that I couldnt sleep unless I had
communed with the genius of Buonarotti

He seemed deeply versed in local history and tradition and he expatiated
_con amore_ on the charms of Florence I gathered that he was an old
resident and that he had taken the lovely city into his heart I owe
her everything he declared Its only since I came here that I have
really lived intellectually One by one all profane desires all mere
worldly aims have dropped away from me and left me nothing but my
pencil my little notebook and he tapped his breastpocket and the
worship of the pure mastersthose who were pure because they were
innocent and those who were pure because they were strong

And have you been very productive all this time I asked
sympathetically

He was silent a while before replying Not in the vulgar sense he
said at last I have chosen never to manifest myself by imperfection
The good in every performance I have reabsorbed into the generative
force of new creations the badthere is always plenty of thatI have
religiously destroyed I may say with some satisfaction that I have
not added a mite to the rubbish of the world As a proof of my
conscientiousnessand he stopped short and eyed me with extraordinary
candour as if the proof were to be overwhelmingI have never sold a
picture At least no merchant traffics in my heart Do you remember
that divine line in Browning My little studio has never been profaned
by superficial feverish mercenary work Its a temple of labour but
of leisure Art is long If we work for ourselves of course we must
hurry If we work for her we must often pause She can wait

This had brought us to my hotel door somewhat to my relief I confess
for I had begun to feel unequal to the society of a genius of this heroic
strain I left him however not without expressing a friendly hope that
we should meet again The next morning my curiosity had not abated I
was anxious to see him by common daylight I counted upon meeting him in
one of the many pictorial haunts of Florence and I was gratified without
delay I found him in the course of the morning in the Tribune of the
Uffizithat little treasurechamber of worldfamous things He had
turned his back on the Venus de Medici and with his arms resting on the
railmug which protects the pictures and his head buried in his hands
he was lost in the contemplation of that superb triptych of Andrea
Mantegnaa work which has neither the material splendour nor the
commanding force of some of its neighbours but which glowing there with
the loveliness of patient labour suits possibly a more constant need of
the soul I looked at the picture for some time over his shoulder at
last with a heavy sigh he turned away and our eyes met As he
recognised me a deep blush rose to his face he fancied perhaps that he
had made a fool of himself overnight But I offered him my hand with a
friendliness which assured him I was not a scoffer I knew him by his
ardent _chevelure_ otherwise he was much altered His midnight mood was
over and he looked as haggard as an actor by daylight He was far older
than I had supposed and he had less bravery of costume and gesture He
seemed the quiet poor patient artist he had proclaimed himself and the
fact that he had never sold a picture was more obvious than glorious His
velvet coat was threadbare and his short slouched hat of an antique
pattern revealed a rustiness which marked it an original and not one
of the picturesque reproductions which brethren of his craft affect His
eye was mild and heavy and his expression singularly gentle and
acquiescent the more so for a certain pallid leanness of visage which I
hardly knew whether to refer to the consuming fire of genius or to a
meagre diet A very little talk however cleared his brow and brought
back his eloquence

And this is your first visit to these enchanted halls he cried
Happy thrice happy youth And taking me by the arm he prepared to
lead me to each of the preeminent works in turn and show me the cream of
the gallery But before we left the Mantegna he pressed my arm and gave
it a loving look _He_ was not in a hurry he murmured He knew
nothing of raw Haste halfsister to Delay How sound a critic my
friend was I am unable to say but he was an extremely amusing one
overflowing with opinions theories and sympathies with disquisition
and gossip and anecdote He was a shade too sentimental for my own
sympathies and I fancied he was rather too fond of superfine
discriminations and of discovering subtle intentions in shallow places
At moments too he plunged into the sea of metaphysics and floundered a
while in waters too deep for intellectual security But his abounding
knowledge and happy judgment told a touching story of long attentive
hours in this worshipful company there was a reproach to my wasteful
saunterings in so devoted a culture of opportunity There are two
moods I remember his saying in which we may walk through
galleriesthe critical and the ideal They seize us at their pleasure
and we can never tell which is to take its turn The critical mood
oddly is the genial one the friendly the condescending It relishes
the pretty trivialities of art its vulgar cleverness its conscious
graces It has a kindly greeting for anything which looks as if
according to his light the painter had enjoyed doing itfor the little
Dutch cabbages and kettles for the taper fingers and breezy mantles of
latecoming Madonnas for the little bluehilled pastoral sceptical
Italian landscapes Then there are the days of fierce fastidious
longingsolemn church feasts of the intellectwhen all vulgar effort
and all petty success is a weariness and everything but the bestthe
best of the bestdisgusts In these hours we are relentless aristocrats
of taste We will not take Michael Angelo for granted we will not
swallow Raphael whole

The gallery of the Uffizi is not only rich in its possessions but
peculiarly fortunate in that fine architectural accident as one may call
it which unites itwith the breadth of river and city between themto
those princely chambers of the Pitti Palace The Louvre and the Vatican
hardly give you such a sense of sustained inclosure as those long
passages projected over street and stream to establish a sort of
inviolate transition between the two palaces of art We passed along the
gallery in which those precious drawings by eminent hands hang chaste and
gray above the swirl and murmur of the yellow Arno and reached the ducal
saloons of the Pitti Ducal as they are it must be confessed that they
are imperfect as showrooms and that with their deepset windows and
their massive mouldings it is rather a broken light that reaches the
pictured walls But here the masterpieces hang thick and you seem to
see them in a luminous atmosphere of their own And the great saloons
with their superb dim ceilings their outer wall in splendid shadow and
the sombre opposite glow of mellow canvas and dusky gilding make
themselves almost as fine a picture as the Titians and Raphaels they
imperfectly reveal We lingered briefly before many a Raphael and
Titian but I saw my friend was impatient and I suffered him at last to
lead me directly to the goal of our journeythe most tenderly fair of
Raphaels virgins the Madonna in the Chair Of all the fine pictures of
the world it seemed to me this is the one with which criticism has least
to do None betrays less effort less of the mechanism of success and of
the irrepressible discord between conception and result which shows
dimly in so many consummate works Graceful human near to our
sympathies as it is it has nothing of manner of method nothing
almost of style it blooms there in rounded softness as instinct with
harmony as if it were an immediate exhalation of genius The figure
melts away the spectators mind into a sort of passionate tenderness
which he knows not whether he has given to heavenly purity or to earthly
charm He is intoxicated with the fragrance of the tenderest blossom of
maternity that ever bloomed on earth

Thats what I call a fine picture said my companion after we had
gazed a while in silence I have a right to say so for I have copied
it so often and so carefully that I could repeat it now with my eyes
shut Other works are of Raphael this _is_ Raphael himself Others you
can praise you can qualify you can measure explain account for this
you can only love and admire I dont know in what seeming he walked
among men while this divine mood was upon him but after it surely he
could do nothing but die this world had nothing more to teach him Think
of it a while my friend and you will admit that I am not raving Think
of his seeing that spotless image not for a moment for a day in a
happy dream or a restless feverfit not as a poet in a five minutes
frenzytime to snatch his phrase and scribble his immortal stanza but
for days together while the slow labour of the brush went on while the
foul vapours of life interposed and the fancy ached with tension fixed
radiant distinct as we see it now What a master certainly But ah
what a seer

Dont you imagine I answered that he had a model and that some
pretty young woman

As pretty a young woman as you please It doesnt diminish the miracle
He took his hint of course and the young woman possibly sat smiling
before his canvas But meanwhile the painters idea had taken wings
No lovely human outline could charm it to vulgar fact He saw the fair
form made perfect he rose to the vision without tremor without effort
of wing he communed with it face to face and resolved into finer and
lovelier truth the purity which completes it as the fragrance completes
the rose Thats what they call idealism the words vastly abused but
the thing is good Its my own creed at any rate Lovely Madonna
model at once and muse I call you to witness that I too am an idealist

An idealist then I said half jocosely wishing to provoke him to
further utterance is a gentleman who says to Nature in the person of a
beautiful girl Go to you are all wrong Your fine is coarse your
bright is dim your grace is _gaucherie_ This is the way you should
have done it Is not the chance against him

He turned upon me almost angrily but perceiving the genial savour of my
sarcasm he smiled gravely Look at that picture he said and cease
your irreverent mockery Idealism is _that_ Theres no explaining it
one must feel the flame It says nothing to Nature or to any beautiful
girl that they will not both forgive It says to the fair woman
Accept me as your artist friend lend me your beautiful face trust me
help me and your eyes shall be half my masterpiece No one so loves
and respects the rich realities of nature as the artist whose imagination
caresses and flatters them He knows what a fact may hold whether
Raphael knew you may judge by his portrait behind us there of Tommaso
Inghirami bad his fancy hovers above it as Ariel hovered above the
sleeping prince There is only one Raphael bad an artist may still be
an artist As I said last night the days of illumination are gone
visions are rare we have to look long to see them But in meditation we
may still cultivate the ideal round it smooth it perfect it The
resultthe result here his voice faltered suddenly and he fixed his
eyes for a moment on the picture when they met my own again they were
full of tearsthe result may be less than this but still it may be
good it may be _great_ he cried with vehemence It may hang
somewhere in after years in goodly company and keep the artists
memory warm Think of being known to mankind after some such fashion as
this of hanging here through the slow centuries in the gaze of an
altered world living on and on in the cunning of an eye and hand that
are part of the dust of ages a delight and a law to remote generations
making beauty a force and purity an example

Heaven forbid I said smiling that I should take the wind out of
your sails But doesnt it occur to you that besides being strong in
his genius Raphael was happy in a certain good faith of which we have
lost the trick There are people I know who deny that his spotless
Madonnas are anything more than pretty blondes of that period enhanced by
the Raphaelesque touch which they declare is a profane touch Be that
as it may peoples religious and aesthetic needs went arm in arm and
there was as I may say a demand for the Blessed Virgin visible and
adorable which must have given firmness to the artists hand I am
afraid there is no demand now

My companion seemed painfully puzzled he shivered as it were in this
chilling blast of scepticism Then shaking his head with sublime
confidenceThere is always a demand he cried that ineffable type is
one of the eternal needs of mans heart but pious souls long for it in
silence almost in shame Let it appear and their faith grows brave
How _should_ it appear in this corrupt generation It cannot be made to
order It could indeed when the order came trumpettoned from the
lips of the Church herself and was addressed to genius panting with
inspiration But it can spring now only from the soil of passionate
labour and culture Do you really fancy that while from time to time a
man of complete artistic vision is born into the world that image can
perish The man who paints it has painted everything The subject
admits of every perfectionform colour expression composition It
can be as simple as you please and yet as rich as broad and pure and
yet as full of delicate detail Think of the chance for flesh in the
little naked nestling child irradiating divinity of the chance for
drapery in the chaste and ample garment of the mother think of the great
story you compress into that simple theme Think above all of the
mothers face and its ineffable suggestiveness of the mingled burden of
joy and trouble the tenderness turned to worship and the worship turned
to farseeing pity Then look at it all in perfect line and lovely
colour breathing truth and beauty and mastery

Anch io son pittore I cried Unless I am mistaken you have a
masterpiece on the stocks If you put all that in you will do more than
Raphael himself did Let me know when your picture is finished and
wherever in the wide world I may be I will post back to Florence and pay
my respects tothe _Madonna of the future_

He blushed vividly and gave a heavy sigh half of protest half of
resignation I dont often mention my picture by name I detest this
modern custom of premature publicity A great work needs silence
privacy mystery even And then do you know people are so cruel so
frivolous so unable to imagine a mans wishing to paint a Madonna at
this time of day that I have been laughed atlaughed at sir and his
blush deepened to crimson I dont know what has prompted me to be so
frank and trustful with you You look as if you wouldnt laugh at me My
dear young manand he laid his hand on my armI am worthy of respect
Whatever my talents may be I am honest There is nothing grotesque in a
pure ambition or in a life devoted to it

There was something so sternly sincere in his look and tone that further
questions seemed impertinent I had repeated opportunity to ask them
however for after this we spent much time together Daily for a
fortnight we met by appointment to see the sights He knew the city so
well he had strolled and lounged so often through its streets and
churches and galleries he was so deeply versed in its greater and lesser
memories so imbued with the local genius that he was an altogether
ideal _valet de place_ and I was glad enough to leave my Murray at home
and gather facts and opinions alike from his gossiping commentary He
talked of Florence like a lover and admitted that it was a very old
affair he had lost his heart to her at first sight Its the fashion
to talk of all cities as feminine he said but as a rule its a
monstrous mistake Is Florence of the same sex as New York as Chicago
She is the sole perfect lady of them all one feels towards her as a lad
in his teens feels to some beautiful older woman with a history She
fills you with a sort of aspiring gallantry This disinterested passion
seemed to stand my friend in stead of the common social ties he led a
lonely life and cared for nothing but his work I was duly flattered by
his having taken my frivolous self into his favour and by his generous
sacrifice of precious hours to my society We spent many of these hours
among those early paintings in which Florence is so rich returning ever
and anon with restless sympathies to wonder whether these tender
blossoms of art had not a vital fragrance and savour more precious than
the fullfruited knowledge of the later works We lingered often in the
sepulchral chapel of San Lorenzo and watched Michael Angelos
dimvisaged warrior sitting there like some awful Genius of Doubt and
brooding behind his eternal mask upon the mysteries of life We stood
more than once in the little convent chambers where Fra Angelico wrought
as if an angel indeed had held his hand and gathered that sense of
scattered dews and early birdnotes which makes an hour among his relics
seem like a morning stroll in some monkish garden We did all this and
much morewandered into dark chapels damp courts and dusty
palacerooms in quest of lingering hints of fresco and lurking treasures
of carving

I was more and more impressed with my companions remarkable singleness
of purpose Everything was a pretext for some wildly idealistic rhapsody
or reverie Nothing could be seen or said that did not lead him sooner
or later to a glowing discourse on the true the beautiful and the good
If my friend was not a genius he was certainly a monomaniac and I found
as great a fascination in watching the odd lights and shades of his
character as if he had been a creature from another planet He seemed
indeed to know very little of this one and lived and moved altogether
in his own little province of art A creature more unsullied by the
world it is impossible to conceive and I often thought it a flaw in his
artistic character that he had not a harmless vice or two It amused me
greatly at times to think that he was of our shrewd Yankee race but
after all there could be no better token of his American origin than
this high aesthetic fever The very heat of his devotion was a sign of
conversion those born to European opportunity manage better to reconcile
enthusiasm with comfort He had moreover all our native mistrust for
intellectual discretion and our native relish for sonorous superlatives
As a critic he was very much more generous than just and his mildest
terms of approbation were stupendous transcendent and
incomparable The small change of admiration seemed to him no coin for
a gentleman to handle and yet frank as he was intellectually he was
personally altogether a mystery His professions somehow were all half
professions and his allusions to his work and circumstances left
something dimly ambiguous in the background He was modest and proud
and never spoke of his domestic matters He was evidently poor yet he
must have had some slender independence since he could afford to make so
merry over the fact that his culture of ideal beauty had never brought
him a penny His poverty I supposed was his motive for neither
inviting me to his lodging nor mentioning its whereabouts We met either
in some public place or at my hotel where I entertained him as freely as
I might without appearing to be prompted by charity He seemed always
hungry and this was his nearest approach to human grossness I made a
point of asking no impertinent questions but each time we met I
ventured to make some respectful allusion to the _magnum opus_ to
inquire as it were as to its health and progress We are getting on
with the Lords help he would say with a grave smile We are doing
well You see I have the grand advantage that I lose no time These
hours I spend with you are pure profit They are _suggestive_ Just as
the truly religious soul is always at worship the genuine artist is
always in labour He takes his property wherever he finds it and learns
some precious secret from every object that stands up in the light If
you but knew the rapture of observation I gather with every glance some
hint for light for colour or relief When I get home I pour out my
treasures into the lap of toy Madonna Oh I am not idle _Nulla dies
sine linea_

I was introduced in Florence to an American lady whose drawingroom had
long formed an attractive place of reunion for the foreign residents She
lived on a fourth floor and she was not rich but she offered her
visitors very good tea little cakes at option and conversation not
quite to match Her conversation had mainly an aesthetic flavour for
Mrs Coventry was famously artistic Her apartment was a sort of Pitti
Palace _au petit pied_ She possessed early masters by the dozena
cluster of Peruginos in her diningroom a Giotto in her boudoir an
Andrea del Sarto over her drawingroom chimneypiece Surrounded by
these treasures and by innumerable bronzes mosaics majolica dishes
and little wormeaten diptychs covered with angular saints on gilded
backgrounds our hostess enjoyed the dignity of a sort of highpriestess
of the arts She always wore on her bosom a huge miniature copy of the
Madonna della Seggiola Gaining her ear quietly one evening I asked her
whether she knew that remarkable man Mr Theobald

Know him she exclaimed know poor Theobald All Florence knows him
his flamecoloured locks his black velvet coat his interminable
harangues on the beautiful and his wondrous Madonna that mortal eye has
never seen and that mortal patience has quite given up expecting

Really I cried you dont believe in his Madonna

My dear ingenuous youth rejoined my shrewd friend has he made a
convert of you Well we all believed in him once he came down upon
Florence and took the town by storm Another Raphael at the very least
had been born among men and the poor dear United States were to have the
credit of him Hadnt he the very hair of Raphael flowing down on his
shoulders The hair alas but not the head We swallowed him whole
however we hung upon his lips and proclaimed his genius on the house
tops The women were all dying to sit to him for their portraits and be
made immortal like Leonardos Joconde We decided that his manner was a
good deal like Leonardosmysterious and inscrutable and fascinating
Mysterious it certainly was mystery was the beginning and the end of it
The months passed by and the miracle hung fire our master never
produced his masterpiece He passed hours in the galleries and churches
posturing musing and gazing he talked more than ever about the
beautiful but he never put brush to canvas We had all subscribed as
it were to the great performance but as it never came off people began
to ask for their money again I was one of the last of the faithful I
carried devotion so far as to sit to him for my head If you could have
seen the horrible creature he made of me you would admit that even a
woman with no more vanity than will tie her bonnet straight must have
cooled off then The man didnt know the very alphabet of drawing His
strong point he intimated was his sentiment but is it a consolation
when one has been painted a fright to know it has been done with
peculiar gusto One by one I confess we fell away from the faith and
Mr Theobald didnt lift his little finger to preserve us At the first
hint that we were tired of waiting and that we should like the show to
begin he was off in a huff Great work requires time contemplation
privacy mystery O ye of little faith We answered that we didnt
insist on a great work that the fiveact tragedy might come at his
convenience that we merely asked for something to keep us from yawning
some inexpensive little _lever de rideau_ Hereupon the poor man took
his stand as a genius misconceived and persecuted an _ame meconnue_ and
washed his hands of us from that hour No I believe he does me the
honour to consider me the head and front of the conspiracy formed to nip
his glory in the buda bud that has taken twenty years to blossom Ask
him if he knows me and he will tell you I am a horribly ugly old woman
who has vowed his destruction because he wont paint her portrait as a
pendant to Titians Flora I fancy that since then he has had none but
chance followers innocent strangers like yourself who have taken him at
his word The mountain is still in labour I have not heard that the
mouse has been born I pass him once in a while in the galleries and he
fixes his great dark eyes on me with a sublimity of indifference as if I
were a bad copy of a Sassoferrato It is a long time ago now that I
heard that he was making studies for a Madonna who was to be a _resume_
of all the other Madonnas of the Italian schoollike that antique Venus
who borrowed a nose from one great image and an ankle from another Its
certainly a masterly idea The parts may be fine but when I think of my
unhappy portrait I tremble for the whole He has communicated this
striking idea under the pledge of solemn secrecy to fifty chosen spirits
to every one he has ever been able to buttonhole for five minutes I
suppose he wants to get an order for it and he is not to blame for
Heaven knows how he lives I see by your blush my hostess frankly
continued that you have been honoured with his confidence You neednt
be ashamed my dear young man a man of your age is none the worse for a
certain generous credulity Only allow me to give you a word of advice
keep your credulity out of your pockets Dont pay for the picture till
its delivered You have not been treated to a peep at it I imagine No
more have your fifty predecessors in the faith There are people who
doubt whether there is any picture to be seen I fancy myself that if
one were to get into his studio one would find something very like the
picture in that tale of Balzacsa mere mass of incoherent scratches and
daubs a jumble of dead paint

I listened to this pungent recital in silent wonder It had a painfully
plausible sound and was not inconsistent with certain shy suspicions of
my own My hostess was not only a clever woman but presumably a
generous one I determined to let my judgment wait upon events Possibly
she was right but if she was wrong she was cruelly wrong Her version
of my friends eccentricities made me impatient to see him again and
examine him in the light of public opinion On our next meeting I
immediately asked him if he knew Mrs Coventry He laid his hand on my
arm and gave me a sad smile Has she taxed _your_ gallantry at last
he asked Shes a foolish woman Shes frivolous and heartless and
she pretends to be serious and kind She prattles about Giottos second
manner and Vittoria Colonnas liaison with Michaelone would think
that Michael lived across the way and was expected in to take a hand at
whistbut she knows as little about art and about the conditions of
production as I know about Buddhism She profanes sacred words he
added more vehemently after a pause She cares for you only as some
one to band teacups in that horrible mendacious little parlour of hers
with its trumpery Peruginos If you cant dash off a new picture every
three days and let her hand it round among her guests she tells them in
plain English that you are an impostor

This attempt of mine to test Mrs Coventrys accuracy was made in the
course of a late afternoon walk to the quiet old church of San Miniato
on one of the hilltops which directly overlook the city from whose
gates you are guided to it by a stony and cypressbordered walk which
seems a very fitting avenue to a shrine No spot is more propitious to
lingering repose than the broad terrace in front of the church where
lounging against the parapet you may glance in slow alternation from the
black and yellow marbles of the church facade seamed and cracked with
time and windsown with a tender flora of its own down to the full domes
and slender towers of Florence and over to the blue sweep of the wide
mouthed cup of mountains into whose hollow the little treasure city has
been dropped I had proposed as a diversion from the painful memories
evoked by Mrs Coventrys name that Theobald should go with me the next
evening to the opera where some rarelyplayed work was to be given He
declined as I half expected for I observed that he regularly kept his
evenings in reserve and never alluded to his manner of passing them
You have reminded me before I said smiling of that charming speech
of the Florentine painter in Alfred de Mussets Lorenzaccio I do no
harm to anyone I pass my days in my studio On Sunday I go to the
Annunziata or to Santa Mario the monks think I have a voice they dress
me in a white gown and a red cap and I take a share in the choruses
sometimes I do a little solo these are the only times I go into public
In the evening I visit my sweetheart when the night is fine we pass it
on her balcony I dont know whether you have a sweetheart or whether
she has a balcony But if you are so happy its certainly better than
trying to find a charm in a thirdrate prima donna

He made no immediate response but at last he turned to me solemnly Can
you look upon a beautiful woman with reverent eyes

Really I said I dont pretend to be sheepish but I should be sorry
to think I was impudent And I asked him what in the world he meant
When at last I had assured him that I could undertake to temper
admiration with respect he informed me with an air of religious
mystery that it was in his power to introduce me to the most beautiful
woman in ItalyA beauty with a soul

Upon my word I cried you are extremely fortunate and that is a most
attractive description

This womans beauty he went on is a lesson a morality a poem Its
my daily study

Of course after this I lost no time in reminding him of what before we
parted had taken the shape of a promise I feel somehow he had said
as if it were a sort of violation of that privacy in which I have always
contemplated her beauty This is friendship my friend No hint of her
existence has ever fallen from my lips But with too great a familiarity
we are apt to lose a sense of the real value of things and you perhaps
will throw some new light upon it and offer a fresher interpretation

We went accordingly by appointment to a certain ancient house in the
heart of Florencethe precinct of the Mercato Vecchioand climbed a
dark steep staircase to the very summit of the edifice Theobalds
beauty seemed as loftily exalted above the line of common vision as his
artistic ideal was lifted above the usual practice of men He passed
without knocking into the dark vestibule of a small apartment and
flinging open an inner door ushered me into a small saloon The room
seemed mean and sombre though I caught a glimpse of white curtains
swaying gently at an open window At a table near a lamp sat a woman
dressed in black working at a piece of embroidery As Theobald entered
she looked up calmly with a smile but seeing me she made a movement of
surprise and rose with a kind of stately grace Theobald stepped
forward took her hand and kissed it with an indescribable air of
immemorial usage As he bent his head she looked at me askance and I
thought she blushed

Behold the Serafina said Theobald frankly waving me forward This
is a friend and a lover of the arts he added introducing me I
received a smile a curtsey and a request to be seated

The most beautiful woman in Italy was a person of a generous Italian type
and of a great simplicity of demeanour Seated again at her lamp with
her embroidery she seemed to have nothing whatever to say Theobald
bending towards her in a sort of Platonic ecstasy asked her a dozen
paternally tender questions as to her health her state of mind her
occupations and the progress of her embroidery which he examined
minutely and summoned me to admire It was some portion of an
ecclesiastical vestmentyellow satin wrought with an elaborate design of
silver and gold She made answer in a full rich voice but with a
brevity which I hesitated whether to attribute to native reserve or to
the profane constraint of my presence She had been that morning to
confession she had also been to market and had bought a chicken for
dinner She felt very happy she had nothing to complain of except that
the people for whom she was making her vestment and who furnished her
materials should be willing to put such rotten silver thread into the
garment as one might say of the Lord From time to time as she took
her slow stitches she raised her eyes and covered me with a glance which
seemed at first to denote a placid curiosity but in which as I saw it
repeated I thought I perceived the dim glimmer of an attempt to
establish an understanding with me at the expense of our companion
Meanwhile as mindful as possible of Theobalds injunction of reverence
I considered the ladys personal claims to the fine compliment he had
paid her

That she was indeed a beautiful woman I perceived after recovering from
the surprise of finding her without the freshness of youth Her beauty
was of a sort which in losing youth loses little of its essential
charm expressed for the most part as it was in form and structure and
as Theobald would have said in composition She was broad and ample
lowbrowed and largeeyed dark and pale Her thick brown hair hung low
beside her cheek and ear and seemed to drape her head with a covering as
chaste and formal as the veil of a nun The poise and carriage of her
head were admirably free and noble and they were the more effective that
their freedom was at moments discreetly corrected by a little
sanctimonious droop which harmonised admirably with the level gaze of
her dark and quiet eye A strong serene physical nature and the
placid temper which comes of no nerves and no troubles seemed this
ladys comfortable portion She was dressed in plain dull black save
for a sort of dark blue kerchief which was folded across her bosom and
exposed a glimpse of her massive throat Over this kerchief was
suspended a little silver cross I admired her greatly and yet with a
large reserve A certain mild intellectual apathy belonged properly to
her type of beauty and had always seemed to round and enrich it but
this _bourgeoise_ Egeria if I viewed her right betrayed a rather vulgar
stagnation of mind There might have been once a dim spiritual light in
her face but it had long since begun to wane And furthermore in plain
prose she was growing stout My disappointment amounted very nearly to
complete disenchantment when Theobald as if to facilitate my covert
inspection declaring that the lamp was very dim and that she would ruin
her eyes without more light rose and fetched a couple of candles from
the mantelpiece which he placed lighted on the table In this brighter
illumination I perceived that our hostess was decidedly an elderly woman
She was neither haggard nor worn nor gray she was simply coarse The
soul which Theobald had promised seemed scarcely worth making such a
point of it was no deeper mystery than a sort of matronly mildness of
lip and brow I should have been ready even to declare that that
sanctified bend of the head was nothing more than the trick of a person
constantly working at embroidery It occurred to me even that it was a
trick of a less innocent sort for in spite of the mellow quietude of
her wits this stately needlewoman dropped a hint that she took the
situation rather less seriously than her friend When he rose to light
the candles she looked across at me with a quick intelligent smile and
tapped her forehead with her forefinger then as from a sudden feeling
of compassionate loyalty to poor Theobald I preserved a blank face she
gave a little shrug and resumed her work

What was the relation of this singular couple Was he the most ardent of
friends or the most reverent of lovers Did she regard him as an
eccentric swain whose benevolent admiration of her beauty she was not
ill pleased to humour at this small cost of having him climb into her
little parlour and gossip of summer nights With her decent and sombre
dress her simple gravity and that fine piece of priestly needlework
she looked like some pious laymember of a sisterhood living by special
permission outside her convent walls Or was she maintained here aloft
by her friend in comfortable leisure so that he might have before him
the perfect eternal type uncorrupted and untarnished by the struggle
for existence Her shapely hands I observed wore very fair and white
they lacked the traces of what is called honest toil

And the pictures how do they come on she asked of Theobald after a
long pause

Finely finely I have here a friend whose sympathy and encouragement
give me new faith and ardour

Our hostess turned to me gazed at me a moment rather inscrutably and
then tapping her forehead with the gesture she had used a minute before
He has a magnificent genius she said with perfect gravity

I am inclined to think so I answered with a smile

Eh why do you smile she cried If you doubt it you must see the
_bambino_ And she took the lamp and conducted me to the other side of
the room where on the wall in a plain black frame hung a large drawing
in red chalk Beneath it was fastened a little howl for holy water The
drawing represented a very young child entirely naked half nestling
back against his mothers gown but with his two little arms
outstretched as if in the act of benediction It was executed with
singular freedom and power and yet seemed vivid with the sacred bloom of
infancy A sort of dimpled elegance and grace mingled with its
boldness recalled the touch of Correggio Thats what he can do said
my hostess Its the blessed little boy whom I lost Its his very
image and the Signor Teobaldo gave it me as a gift He has given me
many things besides

I looked at the picture for some time and admired it immensely Turning
back to Theobald I assured him that if it were hung among the drawings in
the Uffizi and labelled with a glorious name it would hold its own My
praise seemed to give him extreme pleasure he pressed my hands and his
eyes filled with tears It moved him apparently with the desire to
expatiate on the history of the drawing for he rose and made his adieux
to our companion kissing her band with the same mild ardour as before
It occurred to me that the offer of a similar piece of gallantry on my
own part might help me to know what manner of woman she was When she
perceived my intention she withdrew her hand dropped her eyes solemnly
and made me a severe curtsey Theobald took my arm and led me rapidly
into the street

And what do you think of the divine Serafina he cried with fervour

It is certainly an excellent style of good looks I answered

He eyed me an instant askance and then seemed hurried along by the
current of remembrance You should have seen the mother and the child
together seen them as I first saw themthe mother with her head draped
in a shawl a divine trouble in her face and the bambino pressed to her
bosom You would have said I think that Raphael had found his match in
common chance I was coming in one summer night from a long walk in
the country when I met this apparition at the city gate The woman held
out her hand I hardly knew whether to say What do you want or to
fall down and worship She asked for a little money I saw that she was
beautiful and pale she might have stepped out of the stable of
Bethlehem I gave her money and helped her on her way into the town I
had guessed her story She too was a maiden mother and she had been
turned out into the world in her shame I felt in all my pulses that
here was my subject marvellously realised I felt like one of the old
monkish artists who had had a vision I rescued the poor creatures
cherished them watched them as I would have done some precious work of
art some lovely fragment of fresco discovered in a mouldering cloister
In a monthas if to deepen and sanctify the sadness and sweetness of it
allthe poor little child died When she felt that he was going she
held him up to me for ten minutes and I made that sketch You saw a
feverish haste in it I suppose I wanted to spare the poor little mortal
the pain of his position After that I doubly valued the mother She is
the simplest sweetest most natural creature that ever bloomed in this
brave old land of Italy She lives in the memory of her child in her
gratitude for the scanty kindness I have been able to show her and in
her simple religion She is not even conscious of her beauty my
admiration has never made her vain Heaven knows that I have made no
secret of it You must have observed the singular transparency of her
expression the lovely modesty of her glance And was there ever such a
truly virginal brow such a natural classic elegance in the wave of the
hair and the arch of the forehead I have studied her I may say I know
her I have absorbed her little by little my mind is stamped and
imbued and I have determined now to clinch the impression I shall at
last invite her to sit for me

At lastat last I repeated in much amazement Do you mean that
she has never done so yet

I have not really hadaa sitting said Theobald speaking very
slowly I have taken notes you know I have got my grand fundamental
impression Thats the great thing But I have not actually had her as
a model posed and draped and lighted before my easel

What had become for the moment of my perception and my tact I am at a
loss to say in their absence I was unable to repress a headlong
exclamation I was destined to regret it We had stopped at a turning
beneath a lamp My poor friend I exclaimed laying my hand on his
shoulder you have _dawdled_ Shes an old old womanfor a Madonna

It was as if I had brutally struck him I shall never forget the long
slow almost ghastly look of pain with which he answered me

Dawdledold old he stammered Are you joking

Why my dear fellow I suppose you dont take her for a woman of
twenty

He drew a long breath and leaned against a house looking at me with
questioning protesting reproachful eyes At last starting forward
and grasping my armAnswer me solemnly does she seem to you truly old
Is she wrinkled is she faded am I blind

Then at last I understood the immensity of his illusion how one by one
the noiseless years had ebbed away and left him brooding in charmed
inaction for ever preparing for a work for ever deferred It seemed to
me almost a kindness now to tell him the plain truth I should be sorry
to say you are blind I answered but I think you are deceived You
have lost time in effortless contemplation Your friend was once young
and fresh and virginal but I protest that was some years ago Still
she has _de beaux restes_ By all means make her sit for you I broke
down his face was too horribly reproachful

He took off his hat and stood passing his handkerchief mechanically over
his forehead _De beaux restes_ I thank you for sparing me the plain
English I must make up my Madonna out of _de beaux restes_ What a
masterpiece she will be Oldold Oldold he murmured

Never mind her age I cried revolted at what I had done never mind
my impression of her You have your memory your notes your genius
Finish your picture in a month I pronounce it beforehand a masterpiece
and I hereby offer you for it any sum you may choose to ask

He stared but he seemed scarcely to understand me Oldold he kept
stupidly repeating If she is old what am I If her beauty has faded
wherewhere is my strength Has life been a dream Have I worshipped
too longhave I loved too well The charm in truth was broken That
the chord of illusion should have snapped at my light accidental touch
showed how it had been weakened by excessive tension The poor fellows
sense of wasted time of vanished opportunity seemed to roll in upon his
soul in waves of darkness He suddenly dropped his head and burst into
tears

I led him homeward with all possible tenderness but I attempted neither
to check his grief to restore his equanimity nor to unsay the hard
truth When we reached my hotel I tried to induce him to come so

We will drink a glass of wine I said smiling to the completion of
the Madonna

With a violent effort he held up his head mused for a moment with a
formidably sombre frown and then giving me his hand I will finish it
he cried in a month No in a fortnight After all I have it
_here_ And he tapped his forehead Of course shes old She can
afford to have it said of hera woman who has made twenty years pass
like a twelvemonth Oldold Why sir she shall be eternal

I wished to see him safely to his own door but he waved me back and
walked away with an air of resolution whistling and swinging his cane I
waited a moment and then followed him at a distance and saw him proceed
to cross the Santa Trinita Bridge When he reached the middle he
suddenly paused as if his strength had deserted him and leaned upon the
parapet gazing over into the river I was careful to keep him in sight
I confess that I passed ten very nervous minutes He recovered himself
at last and went his way slowly and with hanging head

That I had really startled poor Theobald into a bolder use of his long
garnered stores of knowledge and taste into the vulgar effort and hazard
of production seemed at first reason enough for his continued silence
and absence but as day followed day without his either calling or
sending me a line and without my meeting him in his customary haunts in
the galleries in the Chapel at San Lorenzo or strolling between the
Arno side and the great hedgescreen of verdure which along the drive of
the Cascine throws the fair occupants of barouche and phaeton into such
becoming reliefas for more than a week I got neither tidings nor sight
of him I began to fear that I had fatally offended him and that
instead of giving a wholesome impetus to his talent I had brutally
paralysed it I had a wretched suspicion that I had made him ill My
stay at Florence was drawing to a close and it was important that
before resuming my journey I should assure myself of the truth
Theobald to the last had kept his lodging a mystery and I was
altogether at a loss where to look for him The simplest course was to
make inquiry of the beauty of the Mercato Vecchio and I confess that
unsatisfied curiosity as to the lady herself counselled it as well
Perhaps I had done her injustice and she was as immortally fresh and
fair as be conceived her I was at any rate anxious to behold once
more the ripe enchantress who had made twenty years pass as a
twelvemonth I repaired accordingly one morning to her abode climbed
the interminable staircase and reached her door It stood ajar and as
I hesitated whether to enter a little servingmaid came clattering out
with an empty kettle as if she had just performed some savoury errand
The inner door too was open so I crossed the little vestibule and
entered the room in which I had formerly been received It had not its
evening aspect The table or one end of it was spread for a late
breakfast and before it sat a gentlemanan individual at least of the
male sexdoing execution upon a beefsteak and onions and a bottle of
wine At his elbow in friendly proximity was placed the lady of the
house Her attitude as I entered was not that of an enchantress With
one hand she held in her lap a plate of smoking maccaroni with the other
she had lifted high in air one of the pendulous filaments of this
succulent compound and was in the act of slipping it gently down her
throat On the uncovered end of the table facing her companion were
ranged half a dozen small statuettes of some snuffcoloured substance
resembling terracotta He brandishing his knife with ardour was
apparently descanting on their merits

Evidently I darkened the door My hostess dropped liner maccaroniinto
her mouth and rose hastily with a harsh exclamation and a flushed face
I immediately perceived that the Signora Serafinas secret was even
better worth knowing than I had supposed and that the way to learn it
was to take it for granted I summoned my best Italian I smiled and
bowed and apologised for my intrusion and in a moment whether or no I
had dispelled the ladys irritation I had at least stimulated her
prudence I was welcome she said I must take a seat This was another
friend of hersalso an artist she declared with a smile which was
almost amiable Her companion wiped his moustache and bowed with great
civility I saw at a glance that he was equal to the situation He was
presumably the author of the statuettes on the table and he knew a money
spending _forestiere_ when he saw one He was a small wiry man with a
clever impudent tossedup nose a sharp little black eye and waxed
ends to his moustache On the side of his head he wore jauntily a little
crimson velvet smokingcap and I observed that his feet were encased in
brilliant slippers On Serafinas remarking with dignity that I was the
friend of Mr Theobald he broke out into that fantastic French of which
certain Italians are so insistently lavish and declared with fervour
that Mr Theobald was a magnificent genius

I am sure I dont know I answered with a shrug If you are in a
position to affirm it you have the advantage of me I have seen nothing
from his hand but the bambino yonder which certainly is fine

He declared that the bambino was a masterpiece a pure Corregio It was
only a pity he added with a knowing laugh that the sketch had not been
made on some good bit of honeycombed old panel The stately Serafina
hereupon protested that Mr Theobald was the soul of honour and that he
would never lend himself to a deceit I am not a judge of genius she
said and I know nothing of pictures I am but a poor simple widow but
I know that the Signor Teobaldo has the heart of an angel and the virtue
of a saint He is my benefactor she added sententiously The after
glow of the somewhat sinister flush with which she had greeted me still
lingered in her cheek and perhaps did not favour her beauty I could not
but fancy it a wise custom of Theobalds to visit her only by
candlelight She was coarse and her pour adorer was a poet

I have the greatest esteem for him I said it is for this reason that
I have been uneasy at not seeing him for ten days Have you seen him Is
he perhaps ill

Ill Heaven forbid cried Serafina with genuine vehemence

Her companion uttered a rapid expletive and reproached her with not
having been to see him She hesitated a moment then she simpered the
least bit and bridled He comes to see mewithout reproach But it
would not be the same for me to go to him though indeed you may almost
call him a man of holy life

He has the greatest admiration for you I said He would have been
honoured by your visit

She looked at me a moment sharply More admiration than you Admit
that Of course I protested with all the eloquence at my command and
my mysterious hostess then confessed that she had taken no fancy to me on
my former visit and that Theobald not having returned she believed I
had poisoned his mind against her It would be no kindness to the poor
gentleman I can tell you that she said He has come to see me every
evening for years Its a long friendship No one knows him as well as
I

I dont pretend to know him or to understand him I said Hes a
mystery Nevertheless he seems to me a little And I touched my
forehead and waved my hand in the air

Serafina glanced at her companion a moment as if for inspiration He
contented himself with shrugging his shoulders as he filled his glass
again The _padrona_ hereupon gave me a more softly insinuating smile
than would have seemed likely to bloom on so candid a brow Its for
that that I love him she said The world has so little kindness for
such persons It laughs at them and despises them and cheats them He
is too good for this wicked life Its his fancy that he finds a little
Paradise up here in my poor apartment If he thinks so how can I help
it He has a strange beliefreally I ought to be ashamed to tell
youthat I resemble the Blessed Virgin Heaven forgive me I let him
think what he pleases so long as it makes him happy He was very kind
to me once and I am not one that forgets a favour So I receive him
every evening civilly and ask after his health and let him look at me
on this side and that For that matter I may say it without vanity I
was worth looking at once And hes not always amusing poor man He
sits sometimes for an hour without speaking a word or else he talks
away without stopping on art and nature and beauty and duty and fifty
fine things that are all so much Latin to me I beg you to understand
that he has never said a word to me that I mightnt decently listen to
He may be a little cracked but hes one of the blessed saints

Eh cried the man the blessed saints were all a little cracked

Serafina I fancied left part of her story untold but she told enough
of it to make poor Theobalds own statement seem intensely pathetic in
its exalted simplicity Its a strange fortune certainly she went
on to have such a friend as this dear mana friend who is less than a
lover and more than a friend I glanced at her companion who preserved
an impenetrable smile twisted the end of his moustache and disposed of
a copious mouthful Was _he_ less than a lover But what will you
have Serafina pursued In this hard world one must not ask too many
questions one must take what comes and keep what one gets I have kept
my good friend for twenty years and I do hope that at this time of day
signore you have not come to turn him against me

I assured her that I had no such design and that I should vastly regret
disturbing Mr Theobalds habits or convictions On the contrary I was
alarmed about him and I should immediately go in search of him She
gave me his address and a florid account of her sufferings at his non
appearance She had not been to him for various reasons chiefly because
she was afraid of displeasing him as he had always made such a mystery
of his home You might have sent this gentleman I ventured to
suggest

Ah cried the gentleman he admires the Signora Serafina but he
wouldnt admire me And then confidentially with his finger on his
nose Hes a purist

I was about to withdraw after having promised that I would inform the
Signora Serafina of my friends condition when her companion who had
risen from table and girded his loins apparently for the onset grasped
me gently by the arm and led me before the row of statuettes I
perceive by your conversation signore that you are a patron of the
arts Allow me to request your honourable attention for these modest
products of my own ingenuity They are brandnew fresh from my atelier
and have never been exhibited in public I have brought them here to
receive the verdict of this dear lady who is a good critic for all she
may pretend to the contrary I am the inventor of this peculiar style of
statuetteof subject manner material everything Touch them I pray
you handle them freelyyou neednt fear Delicate as they look it is
impossible they should break My various creations have met with great
success They are especially admired by Americans I have sent them all
over Europeto London Paris Vienna You may have observed some little
specimens in Paris on the Boulevard in a shop of which they constitute
the specialty There is always a crowd about the window They form a
very pleasing ornament for the mantelshelf of a gay young bachelor for
the boudoir of a pretty woman You couldnt make a prettier present to a
person with whom you wished to exchange a harmless joke It is not
classic art signore of course but between ourselves isnt classic
art sometimes rather a bore Caricature burlesque _la charge_ as the
French say has hitherto been confined to paper to the pen and pencil
Now it has been my inspiration to introduce it into statuary For this
purpose I have invented a peculiar plastic compound which you will permit
me not to divulge Thats my secret signore Its as light you
perceive as cork and yet as firm as alabaster I frankly confess that
I really pride myself as much on this little stroke of chemical ingenuity
as upon the other element of novelty in my creationsmy types What do
you say to my types signore The idea is bold does it strike you as
happy Cats and monkeysmonkeys and catsall human life is there
Human life of course I mean viewed with the eye of the satirist To
combine sculpture and satire signore has been my unprecedented
ambition I flatter myself that I have not egregiously failed

As this jaunty Juvenal of the chimneypiece delivered himself of his
persuasive allocution he took up his little groups successively from the
table held them aloft turned them about rapped them with his knuckles
and gazed at them lovingly with his head on one side They consisted
each of a cat and a monkey fantastically draped in some preposterously
sentimental conjunction They exhibited a certain sameness of motive
and illustrated chiefly the different phases of what in delicate terms
may be called gallantry and coquetry but they were strikingly clever and
expressive and were at once very perfect cats and monkeys and very
natural men and women I confess however that they failed to amuse me
I was doubtless not in a mood to enjoy them for they seemed to me
peculiarly cynical and vulgar Their imitative felicity was revolting
As I looked askance at the complacent little artist brandishing them
between finger and thumb and caressing them with an amorous eye he
seemed to me himself little more than an exceptionally intelligent ape I
mustered an admiring grin however and he blew another blast My
figures are studied from life I have a little menagerie of monkeys
whose frolics I contemplate by the hour As for the cats one has only
to look out of ones back window Since I have begun to examine these
expressive little brutes I have made many profound observations
Speaking signore to a man of imagination I may say that my little
designs are not without a philosophy of their own Truly I dont know
whether the cats and monkeys imitate us or whether its we who imitate
them I congratulated him on his philosophy and he resumed You will
do use the honour to admit that I have handled my subjects with delicacy
Eh it was needed signore I have been free but not too freeeh Just
a hint you know You may see as much or as little as you please These
little groups however are no measure of my invention If you will
favour me with a call at my studio I think that you will admit that my
combinations are really infinite I likewise execute figures to command
You have perhaps some little motivethe fruit of your philosophy of
life signorewhich you would like to have interpreted I can promise
to work it up to your satisfaction it shall be as malicious as you
please Allow me to present you with my card and to remind you that my
prices are moderate Only sixty francs for a little group like that My
statuettes are as durable as bronze_aere perennius_ signoreand
between ourselves I think they are more amusing

As I pocketed his card I glanced at Madonna Serafina wondering whether
she had an eye for contrasts She had picked up one of the little
couples and was tenderly dusting it with a feather broom

What I had just seen and heard had so deepened my compassionate interest
in my deluded friend that I took a summary leave making my way directly
to the house designated by this remarkable woman It was in an obscure
corner of the opposite side of the town and presented a sombre and
squalid appearance An old woman in the doorway on my inquiring for
Theobald ushered me in with a mumbled blessing and an expression of
relief at the poor gentleman having a friend His lodging seemed to
consist of a single room at the top of the house On getting no answer
to my knock I opened the door supposing that he was absent so that it
gave me a certain shock to find him sitting there helpless and dumb He
was seated near the single window facing an easel which supported a
large canvas On my entering he looked up at me blankly without
changing his position which was that of absolute lassitude and
dejection his arms loosely folded his legs stretched before him his
head hanging on his breast Advancing into the room I perceived that his
face vividly corresponded with his attitude He was pale haggard and
unshaven and his dull and sunken eye gazed at me without a spark of
recognition I had been afraid that he would greet me with fierce
reproaches as the cruelly officious patron who had turned his
contentment to bitterness and I was relieved to find that my appearance
awakened no visible resentment Dont you know me I asked as I put
out my hand Have you already forgotten me

He made no response kept his position stupidly and left me staring
about the room It spoke most plaintively for itself Shabby sordid
naked it contained beyond the wretched bed but the scantiest provision
for personal comfort It was bedroom at once and studioa grim ghost of
a studio A few dusty casts and prints on the walls three or four old
canvases turned face inward and a rustylooking colourbox formed with
the easel at the window the sum of its appurtenances The place
savoured horribly of poverty Its only wealth was the picture on the
easel presumably the famous Madonna Averted as this was from the door
I was unable to see its face but at last sickened by the vacant misery
of the spot I passed behind Theobald eagerly and tenderly I can
hardly say that I was surprised at what I founda canvas that was a mere
dead blank cracked and discoloured by time This was his immortal work
Though not surprised I confess I was powerfully moved and I think that
for five minutes I could not have trusted myself to speak At last my
silent nearness affected him he stirred and turned and then rose and
looked at me with a slowly kindling eye I murmured some kind
ineffective nothings about his being ill and needing advice and care but
he seemed absorbed in the effort to recall distinctly what had last
passed between us You were right he said with a pitiful smile I
am a dawdler I am a failure I shall do nothing more in this world
You opened my eyes and though the truth is bitter I bear you no
grudge Amen I have been sitting here for a week face to face with
the truth with the past with my weakness and poverty and nullity I
shall never touch a brush I believe I have neither eaten nor slept
Look at that canvas he went on as I relieved my emotion in an urgent
request that he would come home with me and dine That was to have
contained my masterpiece Isnt it a promising foundation The elements
of it are all _here_ And he tapped his forehead with that mystic
confidence which had marked the gesture before If I could only
transpose them into some brain that has the hand the will Since I have
been sitting here taking stock of my intellects I have come to believe
that I have the material for a hundred masterpieces But my hand is
paralysed now and they will never be painted I never began I waited
and waited to be worthier to begin and wasted my life in preparation
While I fancied my creation was growing it was dying I have taken it
all too hard Michael Angelo didnt when he went at the Lorenzo He
did his best at a venture and his venture is immortal _Thats_ mine
And he pointed with a gesture I shall never forget at the empty canvas
I suppose we are a genus by ourselves in the providential schemewe
talents that cant act that cant do nor dare We take it out in talk
in plans and promises in study in visions But our visions let me
tell you he cried with a toss of his head have a way of being
brilliant and a man has not lived in vain who has seen the things I have
seen Of course you will not believe in them when that bit of wormeaten
cloth is all I have to show for them but to convince you to enchant and
astound the world I need only the hand of Raphael His brain I already
have A pity you will say that I havent his modesty Ah let me
boast and babble now its all I have left I am the half of a genius
Where in the wide world is my other half Lodged perhaps in the vulgar
soul the cunning ready fingers of some dull copyist or some trivial
artisan who turns out by the dozen his easy prodigies of touch But
its not for me to sneer at him he at least does something Hes not a
dawdler Well for me if I had been vulgar and clever and reckless if I
could have shut my eyes and taken my leap

What to say to the poor fellow what to do for him seemed hard to
determine I chiefly felt that I must break the spell of his present
inaction and remove him from the haunted atmosphere of the little room
it was such a cruel irony to call a studio I cannot say I persuaded him
to come out with me he simply suffered himself to be led and when we
began to walk in the open air I was able to appreciate his pitifully
weakened condition Nevertheless he seemed in a certain way to revive
and murmured at last that he should like to go to the Pitti Gallery I
shall never forget our melancholy stroll through those gorgeous halls
every picture on whose walls seemed even to my own sympathetic vision
to glow with a sort of insolent renewal of strength and lustre The eyes
and lips of the great portraits appeared to smile in ineffable scorn of
the dejected pretender who had dreamed of competing with their triumphant
authors the celestial candour even of the Madonna of the Chair as we
paused in perfect silence before her was tinged with the sinister irony
of the women of Leonardo Perfect silence indeed marked our whole
progressthe silence of a deep farewell for I felt in all my pulses as
Theobald leaning on my arm dragged one heavy foot after the other that
he was looking his last When we came out he was so exhausted that
instead of taking him to my hotel to dine I called a carriage and drove
him straight to his own poor lodging He had sunk into an extraordinary
lethargy he lay back in the carriage with his eyes closed as pale as
death his faint breathing interrupted at intervals by a sudden gasp
like a smothered sob or a vain attempt to speak With the help of the
old woman who had admitted me before and who emerged from a dark back
court I contrived to lead him up the long steep staircase and lay him on
his wretched bed To her I gave him in charge while I prepared in all
haste to seek a physician But she followed me out of the room with a
pitiful clasping of her hands

Poor dear blessed gentleman she murmured is he dying

Possibly How long has he been thus

Since a certain night he passed ten days ago I came up in the morning
to make his poor bed and found him sitting up in his clothes before that
great canvas he keeps there Poor dear strange man he says his
prayers to it He had not been to bed nor since then properly What
has happened to him Has he found out about the Serafina she
whispered with a glittering eye and a toothless grin

Prove at least that one old woman can be faithful I said and watch
him well till I come back My return was delayed through the absence
of the English physician who was away on a round of visits and whom I
vainly pursued from house to house before I overtook him I brought him
to Theobalds bedside none too soon A violent fever had seized our
patient and the case was evidently grave A couple of hours later I
knew that he had brain fever From this moment I was with him
constantly but I am far from wishing to describe his illness
Excessively painful to witness it was happily brief Life burned out in
delirium One night in particular that I passed at his pillow listening
to his wild snatches of regret of aspiration of rapture and awe at the
phantasmal pictures with which his brain seemed to swarm comes back to
my memory now like some stray page from a lost masterpiece of tragedy
Before a week was over we had buried him in the little Protestant
cemetery on the way to Fiesole The Signora Serafina whom I had caused
to be informed of his illness had come in person I was told to inquire
about its progress but she was absent from his funeral which was
attended by but a scanty concourse of mourners Half a dozen old
Florentine sojourners in spite of the prolonged estrangement which had
preceded his death had felt the kindly impulse to honour his grave
Among them was my friend Mrs Coventry whom I found on my departure
waiting in her carriage at the gate of the cemetery

Well she said relieving at last with a significant smile the
solemnity of our immediate greeting and the great Madonna Have you
seen her after all

I have seen her I said she is mineby bequest But I shall never
show her to you

And why not pray

My dear Mrs Coventry you would not understand her

Upon my word you are polite

Excuse me I am sad and vexed and bitter And with reprehensible
rudeness I marched away I was excessively impatient to leave Florence
my friends dark spirit seemed diffused through all things I had packed
my trunk to start for Rome that night and meanwhile to beguile my
unrest I aimlessly paced the streets Chance led me at last to the
church of San Lorenzo Remembering poor Theobalds phrase about Michael
AngeloHe did his best at a ventureI went in and turned my steps to
the chapel of the tombs Viewing in sadness the sadness of its immortal
treasures I fancied while I stood there that they needed no ampler
commentary than these simple words As I passed through the church again
to leave it a woman turning away from one of the side altars met me
face to face The black shawl depending from her head draped
picturesquely the handsome visage of Madonna Serafina She stopped as
she recognised me and I saw that she wished to speak Her eye was
bright and her ample bosom heaved in a way that seemed to portend a
certain sharpness of reproach But the expression of my own face
apparently drew the sting from her resentment and she addressed me in a
tone in which bitterness was tempered by a sort of dogged resignation I
know it was you now that separated us she said It was a pity he
ever brought you to see me Of course you couldnt think of me as he
did Well the Lord gave him the Lord has taken him I have just paid
for a nine days mass for his soul And I can tell you this signoreI
never deceived him Who put it into his head that I was made to live on
holy thoughts and fine phrases It was his own fancy and it pleased him
to think soDid he suffer much she added more softly after a pause

His sufferings were great but they were short

And did he speak of me She had hesitated and dropped her eyes she
raised them with her question and revealed in their sombre stillness a
gleam of feminine confidence which for the moment revived and illumined
her beauty Poor Theobald Whatever name he had given his passion it
was still her fine eyes that had charmed him

Be contented madam I answered gravely

She dropped her eyes again and was silent Then exhaling a full rich
sigh as she gathered her shawl togetherHe was a magnificent genius

I bowed and we separated

Passing through a narrow side street on my way back to my hotel I
perceived above a doorway a sign which it seemed to me I had read before
I suddenly remembered that it was identical with the superscription of a
card that I had carried for an hour in my waistcoat pocket On the
threshold stood the ingenious artist whose claims to public favour were
thus distinctly signalised smoking a pipe in the evening air and giving
the finishing polish with a bit of rag to one of his inimitable
combinations I caught the expressive curl of a couple of tails He
recognised me removed his little red cap with a most obsequious bow and
motioned me to enter his studio I returned his salute and passed on
vexed with the apparition For a week afterwards whenever I was seized
among the ruins of triumphant Rome with some peculiarly poignant memory
of Theobalds transcendent illusions and deplorable failure I seemed to
hear a fantastic impertinent murmur Cats and monkeys monkeys and
cats all human life there
