A BIT O LOVE




ACT I

 It is Ascension Day in a village of the West In the low
 panelled hallsittingroom of the BURLACOMBES farmhouse on the
 village green MICHAEL STRANGWAY a clerical collar round his
 throat and a dark Norfolk jacket on his back is playing the
 flute before a very large framed photograph of a woman which is
 the only picture on the walls His age is about thirtyfive his
 figure thin and very upright and his cleanshorn face thin
 upright narrow with long and rather pointed ears his dark
 hair is brushed in a coxcomb off his forehead A faint smile
 hovers about his lips that Nature has made rather full and he
 has made thin as though keeping a hard secret but his bright
 grey eyes dark round the rim look out and upwards almost as if
 he were being crucified There is something about the whole of
 him that makes him seen not quite present A gentle creature
 burnt within

 A low broad window above a windowseat forms the background to
 his figure and through its lattice panes are seen the outer
 gate and yewtrees of a churchyard and the porch of a church
 bathed in May sunlight The front door at right angles to the
 windowseat leads to the village green and a door on the left
 into the house

 It is the third movement of Veracinis violin sonata that
 STRANGWAY plays His back is turned to the door into the house
 and he does not hear when it is opened and IVY BURLACOMBE the
 farmers daughter a girl of fourteen small and quiet as a
 mouse comes in a prayerbook in one hand and in the other a
 gloss of water with wild orchis and a bit of deep pink
 hawthorn She sits down on the windowseat and having opened
 her book sniffs at the flowers Coming to the end of the
 movement STRANGWAY stops and looking up at the face on the
 wall heaves a long sigh

IVY From the seat I picked these for yu Mr Strangway

STRANGWAY Turning with a start Ah Ivy Thank you He puts
his flute down on a chair against the far wall Where are the
others

 As he speaks GLADYS FREMAN a dark gipsyish girl and CONNIE
 TRUSTAFORD a fair stolid blueeyed Saxon both about sixteen
 come in through the front door behind which they have evidently
 been listening They too have prayerbooks in their hands
 They sidle past Ivy and also sit down under the window

GLADYS Mercys comin Mr Strangway

STRANGWAY Good morning Gladys good morning Connie

 He turns to a bookcase on a table against the far wall and
 taking out a book finds his place in it While he stands thus
 with his back to the girls MERCY JARLAND comes in from the
 green She also is about sixteen with fair hair and chinablue
 eyes She glides in quickly hiding something behind her and
 sits down on the seat next the door And at once there is a
 whispering

STRANGWAY Turning to them Good morning Mercy

MERCY Good morning Mr Strangway

STRANGWAY Now yesterday I was telling you what our Lords coming
meant to the world I want you to understand that before He came
there wasnt really love as we know it I dont mean to say that
there werent many good people but there wasnt love for the sake of
loving Dyou think you understand what I mean

 MERCY fidgets GLADYSS eyes are following a fly

IVY Yes Mr Strangway

STRANGWAY It isnt enough to love people because theyre good to
you or because in some way or other youre going to get something by
it We have to love because we love loving Thats the great thing
without that were nothing but Pagans

GLADYS Please what is Pagans

STRANGWAY Thats what the first Christians called the people who
lived in the villages and were not yet Christians Gladys

MERCY We live in a village but were Christians

STRANGWAY With a smile Yes Mercy and what is a Christian

 MERCY kicks afoot sideways against her neighbour frowns over
 her chinablare eyes is silent then as his question passes
 on makes a quick little face wriggles and looks behind her

STRANGWAY Ivy

IVY Tis a manwhuwhu

STRANGWAY YesConnie

CONNIE Who speaks rather thickly as if she had a permanent slight
cold Please Mr Strangway tis a man what goes to church

GLADYS He as to be baptisedand confirmed andandburied

IVY Tis a man whuwhus gude and

GLADYS He dont drink an he dont beat his horses an he dont
hit back

MERCY Whispering Tisnt your turn To STRANGWAY Tis a man
like us

IVY I know what Mrs Strangway said it was cause I asked her
once before she went away

STRANGWAY Startled Yes

IVY She said it was a man whu forgave everything

STRANGWAY Ah

 The note of a cuckoo comes travelling The girls are gazing at
 STRANGWAY who seems to have gone of into a dream They begin
 to fidget and whisper

CONNIE Please Mr Strangway father says if yu hit a man and he
dont hit yu back hes no gude at all

MERCY When Tommy Morse wouldnt fight us pinched himhe did
squeal She giggles Made me laugh

STRANGWAY Did I ever tell you about St Francis of Assisi

IVY Clasping her hands No

STRANGWAY Well he was the best Christian I think that ever
livedsimply full of love and joy

IVY I expect hes dead

STRANGWAY About seven hundred years Ivy

IVY Softly Oh

STRANGWAY Everything to him was brother or sisterthe sun and the
moon and all that was poor and weak and sad and animals and birds
so that they even used to follow him about

MERCY I know He had crumbs in his pocket

STRANGWAY No he had love in his eyes

IVY Tis like about Orpheus that yu told us

STRANGWAY Ah But St Francis was a Christian and Orpheus was a
Pagan

IVY Oh

STRANGWAY Orpheus drew everything after him with music St
Francis by love

IVY Perhaps it was the same really

STRANGWAY looking at his flute Perhaps it was Ivy

GLADYS Did e ave a flute like yu

IVY The flowers smell sweeter when they ear music they du

 She holds up the glass of flowers

STRANGWAY Touching one of the orchis Whats the name of this
one

 The girls cluster save MERCY who is taking a stealthy
 interest in what she has behind her

CONNIE We call it a cuckoo Mr Strangway

GLADYS Tis awful common down by the streams Weve got one medder
where tis so thick almost as the goldie cups

STRANGWAY Odd Ive never noticed it

IVY Please Mr Strangway yu dont notice when yure walkin yu
go along like this

 She holds up her face as one looking at the sky

STRANGWAY Bad as that Ivy

IVY Mrs Strangway often used to pick it last spring

STRANGWAY Did she Did she

 He has gone off again into a kind of dream

MERCY I like being confirmed

STRANGWAY Ah Yes NowWhats that behind you Mercy

MERCY Engagingly producing a cage a little bigger than a
mousetrap containing a skylark My skylark

STRANGWAY What

MERCY It can fly but were goin to clip its wings Bobbie caught
it

STRANGWAY How long ago

MERCY Conscious of impending disaster Yesterday

STRANGWAY White hot Give me the cage

MERCY Puckering I want my skylark As he steps up to her and
takes the cagethoroughly alarmed I gave Bobbie thrippence for it

STRANGWAY Producing a sixpence There

MERCY Throwing it downpassionately I want my skylark

STRANGWAY God made this poor bird for the sky and the grass And
you put it in that Never cage any wild thing Never

MERCY Faint and sullen I want my skylark

STRANGWAY Taking the cage to the door No He holds up the cage
and opens it Off you go poor thing

 The bird flies out and away The girls watch with round eyes
 the fling up of his arm and the freed bird flying away

IVY Im glad

 MERCY kicks her viciously and sobs STRANGWAY comes from the
 door looks at MERCY sobbing and suddenly clasps his head The
 girls watch him with a queer mixture of wonder alarm and
 disapproval

GLADYS Whispering Dont cry Mercy Bobbiell soon catch yu
another

 STRANGWAY has dropped his hands and is looking again at MERCY
 IVY sits with hands clasped gazing at STRANGWAY MERCY
 continues her artificial sobbing

STRANGWAY Quietly The class is over for today

 He goes up to MERCY and holds out his hand She does not take
 it and runs out knuckling her eyes STRANGWAY turns on his
 heel and goes into the house

CONNIE Twasnt his bird

IVY Skylarks belong to the sky Mr Strangway said so

GLADYS Not when theym caught they dont

IVY They du

CONNIE Twas her bird

IVY He gave her sixpence for it

GLADYS She didnt take it

 grey eye and very red cheeks

Now goo ahn Shoo

 She hustles them out rather as she might hustle her chickens
 and begins tidying the room There comes a wandering figure to
 the open window It is that of a man of about thirtyfive of
 feeble gait leaning the weight of all one side of him on a
 stick His dark face with black hair one lock of which has
 gone white was evidently once that of an ardent man Now it is
 slack weakly smiling and the brown eyes are lost and seem
 always to be asking something to which there is no answer

MRS BURLACOMBE With that forced cheerfulness always assumed in
the face of too great misfortune Well Jim better At the faint
brightening of the smile Thats right Yum gettin on bravely
Want Parson

JIM Nodding and smiling and speaking slowly I want to tell un

STRANGWAY Thats her kindness

JIM I dont think it is Tis laziness an avin er own way
Shem very fond of er own way

 A knock on the door cuts off his speech Following closely on
 the knock as though no doors were licensed to be closed against
 her a greyhaired lady enters a capable broadfaced woman of
 seventy whose every tone and movement exhales authority With
 a nod and a good morning to STRANGWAY she turns at face to JIM
 BERE

MRS BRADMERE Ah Jim youre looking better

 JIM BERE shakes his head MRS BRADMERE Oh yes you are
 Getting on splendidly And now I just want to speak to Mr
 Strangway

 JIM BERE touches his forelock and slowly leaning on his
 stick goes out

MRS BRADMERE Waiting for the door to close You know how that
came on him Caught the girl he was engaged to one night with
another man the rage broke something here She touches her
forehead Four years ago

STRANGWAY Poor fellow

 As she speaks Mrs BURLACOMBE returns with a large paleblue
 book in her bared

MRS BURLACOMBE Good day Mm Taking the book across to
STRANGWAY Miss Willie she says shem very sorry zurr

STRANGWAY She was very welcome Mrs Burlacombe To MRS
BURLACOMBE Forgive memy sermon

 He goes into the house The two women graze after him Then
 at once as it were draw into themselves as if preparing for
 an encounter and yet seem to expand as if losing the need for
 restraint

MRS BRADMERE Abruptly He misses his wife very much Im afraid

MRS BURLACOMBE Ah Dont he Poor dear man he keeps a terrible

 She goes into the house

MRS BRADMERE Old pusscat

 She turns to go and in the doorway encounters a very little
 redcheeked girl in a peacockblue cap and pink frock who
 curtsies stolidly

MRS BRADMERE Well Tibby Jarland what do you want here Always
sucking something arent you

 Getting no reply from Tibby JARLAND she passes out Tibby
 comes in looks round takes a large sweet out of her mouth
 contemplates it and puts it back again Then in a perfunctory
 and very stolid fashion she looks about the floor as if she
 had been told to find something While she is finding nothing
 and sucking her sweet her sister MERCY comes in furtively
 still frowning and vindictive

MERCY What Havent you found it Tibby Get along with ee
then

 She accelerates the stolid Tissys departure with a smack
 searches under the seat finds and picks up the deserted
 sixpence Then very quickly she goes to the door But it is
 opened before she reaches it and finding herself caught she
 slips behind the chintz windowcurtain A woman has entered
 who is clearly the original of the large photograph She is not
 strictly pretty but there is charm in her pale resolute face
 with its mocking lips flexible brows and greenish eyes whose
 lids square above them have short dark lashes She is
 dressed in blue and her fair hair is coiled up under a cap and
 motorveil She comes in swiftly and closes the door behind
 her becomes irresolute then suddenly deciding moves towards
 the door into the house MERCY slips from behind her curtain to
 make off but at that moment the door into the house is opened
 and she has at once to slip back again into covert It is Ivy
 who has appeared

IVY Amazed Oh Mrs Strangway

 Evidently disconcerted by this appearance BEATRICE STRANGWAY
 pulls herself together and confronts the child with a smile

BEATRICE Well Ivyyouve grown You didnt expect me did you

IVY No Mrs Strangway but I hoped yud be comin soon

BEATRICE Ah Yes Is Mr Strangway in

IVY Hypnotized by those faintly smiling lips Yesoh yes Hes
writin his sermon in the little room He will be glad

BEATRICE Going a little closer and never taking her eyes off the
child Yes Now Ivy will you do something for me

IVY Fluttering Oh yes Mrs Strangway

BEATRICE Quite sure

IVY Oh yes

BEATRICE Are you old enough to keep a secret

IVY Nodding Im fourteen now

BEATRICE Well then I dont want anybody but Mr Strangway to
know Ive been here nobody not even your mother Dyou understand

IVY Troubled No Only I can keep a secret

BEATRICE Mind if anybody hears it will hurt Mr Strangway

IVY Oh I wouldnthurthim Must yu go away again Trembling
towards her I wish yu wer goin to stay And perhaps some one has
seen yuThey

BEATRICE Hastily No no one I came motoring like this She
moves her veil to show how it can conceal her face And I came
straight down the little lane and through the barn across the yard

IVY Timidly People du see a lot

BEATRICE Still with that hovering smile I know butNow go
and tell him quickly and quietly

IVY Stopping at the door Mothers pluckin a duck Only
please Mrs Strangway if she comes in even after yuve gone shell
know becausebecause yu always have that particular nice scent

BEATRICE Thank you my child Ill see to that

 Ivy looks at her as if she would speak again then turns
 suddenly and goes out BEATRICES face darkens she shivers
 Taking out a little cigarette case she lights a cigarette and
 watches the puffs of smoke wreathe shout her and die away The
 frightened MERCY peers out spying for a chance to escape
 Then from the house STRANGWAY comes in All his dreaminess is
 gone

STRANGWAY Thank God He stops at the look on her face I dont
understand though I thought you were still out there

BEATRICE Letting her cigarette fall and putting her foot on it
No

STRANGWAY Youre staying Oh Beatrice come Well get away from
here at onceas far as faranywhere you like Oh my darling
only come If you knew

BEATRICE Its no good Michael Ive tried and tried

STRANGWAY Not Then why Beatrice You said when you were
right awayIve waited

BEATRICE I know Its cruelits horrible But I told you not to
hope Michael Ive done my best All these months at Mentone Ive
been wondering why I ever let you marry mewhen that feeling wasnt
dead

STRANGWAY You cant have come back just to leave me again

BEATRICE When you let me go out there with mother I thoughtI did
think I would be able and I had begunand thenspring came

STRANGWAY Spring came here too Never soaching Beatrice cant

BEATRICE I came straight back to him

STRANGWAY To Durford

BEATRICE To the Crossway Hotel miles outin my own name They
dont know me there I told you not to hope Michael Ive done my
best I swear it

STRANGWAY My God

BEATRICE It was your God that brought us to live near him

STRANGWAY Why have you come to me like this

BEATRICE To know what youre going to do Are you going to divorce

disqualified and he hasnt a penny without his work

STRANGWAY Why should I spare him

BEATRICE Michael I came to beg Its hard

STRANGWAY No dont beg I cant stand it

 She shakes her head

BEATRICE Recovering her pride What are you going to do then
Keep us apart by the threat of a divorce Starve us and prison us
Cage me up here with you Im not brute enough to ruin him

STRANGWAY Heaven

BEATRICE I never really stopped loving him I neverloved you
Michael

STRANGWAY Stunned Is that true BEATRICE bends her head
Never loved me Notthat nighton the rivernot

BEATRICE Under her breath No

STRANGWAY Were you lying to me then Kissing me andhating me

BEATRICE One doesnt hate men like you but it wasnt love

STRANGWAY Why did you tell me it was

BEATRICE Yes That was the worst thing Ive ever done

STRANGWAY Do you think I would have married you I would have
burned first I never dreamed you didnt I swear it

BEATRICE Very low Forget it

STRANGWAY Did he try to get you away from me BEATRICE gives him
a swift look Tell me the truth

BEATRICE No It wasIalone Buthe loves me

STRANGWAY One does not easily know love it seems

 But her smile faint mysterious pitying is enough and he
 turns away from her

BEATRICE It was cruel to come I know For me too But I
couldnt write I had to know

STRANGWAY Never loved me Never loved me That night at Tregaron
At the look on her face You might have told me before you went
away Why keep me all these

BEATRICE I meant to forget him again I did mean to I thought I
could get back to what I was when I married you but you see what
a girl can do a woman thats been marriedcant

STRANGWAY Then it was Imy kisses that He laughs How did
you stand them His eyes dart at her face Imagination helped you
perhaps

BEATRICE Michael dont dont Andoh dont make a public thing
of it You neednt be afraid I shall have too good a time

 He stays quite still and silent and that which is writhing in
 him makes his face so strange that BEATRICE stands aghast At
 last she goes stumbling on in speech

If ever you want to marry some one elsethen of coursethats only
fair ruin or not But till thentill thenHes leaving
Durford going to Brighton No one need know And youthis isnt
the only parish in the world

STRANGWAY Quietly You ask me to help you live in secret with
another man

BEATRICE I ask for mercy

STRANGWAY As to himself What am I to do

BEATRICE What you feel in the bottom of your heart

STRANGWAY You ask me to help you live in sin

BEATRICE To let me go out of your life Youve only to do
nothing He goes slowly close to her

STRANGWAY I want you Come back to me Beatrice come back

BEATRICE It would be torture now

STRANGWAY Writhing Oh

BEATRICE Whatevers in your heartdo

STRANGWAY Youd come back to me sooner than ruin him Would you

BEATRICE I cant bring him harm

STRANGWAY Turning away Godif there be one help me He
stands leaning his forehead against the window Suddenly his glance
falls on the little bird cage still lying on the windowseat Never
cage any wild thing He gives a laugh that is half a sob then
turning to the door says in a low voice Go Go please quickly
Do what you will I wont hurt youcantButgo He opens
the door

BEATRICE Greatly moved Thank you

 She passes him with her head down and goes out quickly
 STRANGWAY stands unconsciously tearing at the little birdcage
 And while he tears at it he utters a moaning sound The
 terrified MERCY peering from behind the curtain and watching
 her chance slips to the still open door but in her haste and
 fright she knocks against it and STRANGWAY sees her Before he
 can stop her she has fled out on to the green and away

 While he stands there paralysed the door from the house is
 opened and MRS BURLACOMBE approaches him in a queer hushed
 way

When she is gone Strangway passes his handkerchief across his

CREMER a big man in labourers clothes with a thick broad face
and tragic faithful eyes comes in and stands a little in from the
closed door quite dumb

 what to do They blindly he takes up his flute and hatless
 hurries out into the air

 opposite is the porch door on to the green The wall between is
 nearly all window with leaded panes one wideopen casement
 whereof lets in the last of the sunlight A narrow bench runs
 under this broad window And this is all the furniture save
 three spittoons

 GODLEIGH the innkeeper a smallish man with thick ruffled hair
 a loquacious nose and applered cheeks above a reddishbrown
 moustache is reading the paper To him enters TIBBY JARLAND
 with a shilling in her mouth

 receives a long clay pipe and eleven pennies In order to
 secure the coins in her pinafore she places the clay pipe in her
 mouth While she is still thus engaged MRS BRADMERE enters
 the porch and comes in TIBBY curtsies stolidly

MRS BRADMERE Gracious child What are you doing here And what

JARLAND Take other folks property fast enough

 He saws the air with his empty The others have all turned to

 fellowmen The bell for church has begun to rang the sun is
 down and it is getting dusk

He wants one on his crop an one in is belly e wants a man to
take an gie un a gude hidin zame as he oughter give is flybenight

 In the deadly silence GODLEIGH touches the arm of JARLAND
 who leaning against the bar with the pewter in his hand is
 staring with his strange lowering eyes straight at STRANGWAY

 They are all looking at STRANGWAY who under JARLANDS drunken
 insults is standing rigid with his eyes closed and his hands
 hard clenched The church bell has stopped slow ringing and
 begun its five minutes hurrying note

TRUSTAFORD Rising and trying to hook his arm into JARLANDS
Come away Tam yuve aad to much man

JARLAND Shaking him off Zee e darsent touch me I might it

 He raises the pewter as though to fling it but it is seized by
 GODLEIGH from behind and falls clattering to the floor
 STRANGWAY has not moved

JARLAND Shaking his fist almost in his face Luke at un Luke at
un A man wi a slut for a wife

 As he utters the word wife STRANGWAY seizes the outstretched
 fist and with a jujitsu movement draws him into his clutch
 helpless And as they sway and struggle in the open window
 with the false strength of fury he forces JARLAND through
 There is a crash of broken glass from outside At the sound
 STRANGWAY comes to himself A look of agony passes over his
 face His eyes light on JIM BERE who has suddenly risen and
 stands feebly clapping his hands STRANGWAY rushes out

 Excitedly gathering at the window they all speak at once

 porch leading to the door round which are gathered five or six
 sturdy fellows dumb as fishes No one sits in the chair In

 wheezy church organ and voices singing can be heard

SCENE III

 The village green before the churchyard and the yewtrees at the
 gate Into the pitch dark under the yews light comes out
 through the halfopen church door Figures are lurking or
 moving stealthilypeople waiting and listening to the sound of
 a voice speaking in the church words that are inaudible
 Excited whispering and faint giggles come from the deepest
 yewtree shade made ghostly by the white faces and the frocks of
 young girls continually flitting up and back in the blackness A
 girls figure comes flying out from the porch down the path of
 light and joins the stealthy group

WHISPERING VOICE of MERCY Wheres e got to now Gladys

 She jumps up and dawn in the darkness And a voice from far in
 the shadow says Hsssh Quiet yu maids The voice has
 ceased speaking in the church There is a moments dead
 silence The voice speaks again then from the wheezy little
 organ come the first faint chords of a hymn

GLADYS Nearer my God to Thee

VOICE of MERCY Twill be funny with no one ardly singin

 The sound of the old hymn sung by just six voices comes out to
 them rather sweet and clear

GLADYS Softly Tis pretty tu Why Theyre only singin one
verse

 A moments silence and the voice speaks uplifted pronouncing
 the Blessing The peace of God As the last words die away
 dark figures from the inn approach over the grass till quite a
 crowd seems standing there without a word spoken Then from out
 of the church porch come the congregation TIM CLYST first
 hastily lost among the waiting figures in the dark old Mrs
 Potter a half blind old lady groping her way and perceiving
 nothing out of the ordinary the two maids from the Hall
 selfconscious and scared scuttling along Last IVY BURLACOMBE
 quickly and starting back at the dim halfhidden crowd

VOICE of GLADYS Whispering Ivy Here quick

 Ivy sways darts off towards the voice and is lost in the
 shadow

VOICE OF FREMAN Low Wait boys till I give signal

 Two or three squirks and giggles Tim CLYSTS voice Yaas
 Dont ee tread on my toe A soft frightened Ooh from a
 girl Some quick excited whisperings Luke Zee there
 Hes comin And then a perfectly dead silence The figure
 of STRANGWAY is seen in his dark clothes passing from the
 vestry to the church porch He stands plainly visible in the
 lighted porch locking the door then steps forward Just as he
 reaches the edge of the porch a low hiss breaks the silence
 It swells very gradually into a long hissing groan STRANGWAY
 stands motionless his hand over his eyes staring into the
 darkness A girls figure can be seen to break out of the
 darkness and rush away When at last the groaning has died into
 sheer expectancy STRANGWAY drops his hand

STRANGWAY In a loco voice Yes Im glad Is Jarland there

FREMAN Hes ereno thanks to yu Hsss

 The hiss breaks out again then dies away

JARLANDS VOICE Threatening Try if yu can du it again

STRANGWAY No Jarland no I ask you to forgive me Humbly

 A hesitating silence broken by muttering

CLYSTS VOICE Bravo

A VOICE Thats vair

A VOICE Es afraid o the sackthats what tis

A VOICE Groaning Es a praaper coward

A VOICE Whu funked the doctor

CLYSTS VOICE Shame on ee therr

STRANGWAY Youre rightall of you Im not fit An uneasy and
excited mustering and whispering dies away into renewed silence

STRANGWAY What I did to Tam Jarland is not the real cause of what
youre doing is it I understand But dont be troubled Its all
over Im goingyoull get some one better Forgive me Jarland
I cant see your faceits very dark

FREMANS Voice Mocking Wait for the full mune

GODLEIGH Very low My eart E lighted not

STRANGWAY starting at the sound of his own words thus mysteriously
given him out of the darkness Whoever found that please tear it
up After a moments silence Many of you have been very kind to
me You wont see me againGoodbye all

 He stands for a second motionless then moves resolutely down
 into the darkness so peopled with shadows

UNCERTAIN VOICES AS HE PASSES Goodbye zurr
Good luck zurr He has gone

CLYSTS VOICE Three cheers for Mr Strangway

 And a queer strangled cheer with groans still threading it
 arises


 CURTAIN

 In the BURLACOMBES hallsittingroom the curtains are drawn a

 groaning

 She goes hurriedly BURLACOMBE with a startled look back
 wavers and makes to follow her but stops undecided in the inner
 doorway STRANGWAY comes in from the darkness He turns to the
 window and drops overcoat and hat and the church key on the
 windowseat looking about him as men do when too hard driven
 and never fixing his eyes long enough on anything to see it
 BURLACOMBE closing the door into the house advances a step
 At the sound STRANGWAY faces round

BURLACOMBE I wanted for yu to know zurr that me an mine adnt

STRANGWAY Do I look like that Please please He touches his
breast Ive too much here Please

BURLACOMBE With a sort of startled respect Well zurr tes not
for me to zay nothin certainly

 He turns and after a slow look back at STRANGWAY goes out

STRANGWAY To himself Passions No passions Ha

 The outer door is opened and IVY BURLACOMBE appears and
 seeing him stops Then coming softly towards him she speaks
 timidly

IVY Oh Mr Strangway Mrs Bradmeres cumin from the Rectory I

 STRANGWAY starts stares at her and turning on his heel goes
 into the house Ivys face is all puckered as if she were on
 the point of tears There is a gentle scratching at the door
 which has not been quite closed

 With whispering and scuffling gurgling and squeaking the
 reluctant Ivys hand is caught and she is jerked away In their
 haste they have left the door open behind them

VOICE of MRS BRADMERE Outside Whos that

 She knocks loudly and rings a bell then without waiting
 comes in through the open door

 Noting the overcoat and hat on the windowsill she moves across
 to ring the bell But as she does so MRS BURLACOMBE followed
 by BURLACOMBE comes in from the house

MRS BRADMERE This disgraceful business Wheres Mr Strangway I

MRS BRADMERE Horrible Poor fellow Now come Do your best
Burlacombe

 BURLACOMBE touches his forelock and goes MRS BRADMERE stands
 quite still thinking Then going to the photograph she stares
 up at it

MRS BRADMERE You baggage

 STRANGWAY has come in noiselessly and is standing just behind
 her She turns and sees him There is something so still so
 startlingly still in his figure and white face that she cannot
 for the moment fond her voice

MRS BRADMERE At last This is most distressing Im deeply
sorry Then as he does not answer she goes a step closer Im an
old woman and old women must take liberties you know or they
couldnt get on at all Come now Lets try and talk it over calmly
and see if we cant put things right

STRANGWAY You were very good to come but I would rather not

MRS BRADMERE I know youre in as grievous trouble as a man can be

STRANGWAY Yes

MRS BRADMERE With a little sound of sympathy What are you
thirtyfive Im sixtyeight if Im a dayold enough to be your
mother I can feel what you must have been through all these months
I can indeed But you know youve gone the wrong way to work We
arent angels down here below And a son of the Church cant act as
if for himself alone The eyes of every one are on him

STRANGWAY Taking the church key from the window Take this
please

MRS BRADMERE No no no Jarland deserved all he got You had
great provocation

STRANGWAY Its not Jarland Holding out the key Please take it
to the Rector I beg his forgiveness Touching his breast
Theres too much I cant speak ofcant make plain Take it to him
please

MRS BRADMERE Mr StrangwayI dont accept this I am sure my
husbandthe Churchwill never accept

STRANGWAY Take it

MRS BRADMERE Almost unconsciously taking it Mind We dont
accept it You must come and talk to the Rector tomorrow Youre
overwrought Youll see it all in another light then

STRANGWAY With a strange smile Perhaps Lifting the blind
Beautiful night Couldnt be more beautiful

MRS BRADMERE Startledsoftly Dont turn sway from these who
want to help you Im a grumpy old woman but I can feel for you
Dont try and keep it all back like this A woman would cry and it
would all seem clearer at once Now wont you let me

STRANGWAY No one can help thank you

MRS BRADMERE Come Things havent gone beyond mending really if
youll face them Pointing to the photograph You know what I
mean We dare not foster immorality

STRANGWAY Quivering as at a jabbed nerve Dont speak of that

MRS BRADMERE But think what youve done Mr Strangway If you
cant take your wife back surely you must divorce her You can
never help her to go on like this in secret sin

STRANGWAY Torture herone way or the other

MRS BRADMERE No no I want you to do as the Churchas all
Christian society would wish Come You cant let this go on My
dear man do your duty at all costs

STRANGWAY Break her heart

MRS BRADMERE Then you love that womanmore than God

STRANGWAY His face quivering Love

MRS BRADMERE They told meYes and I can see youre is a bad
way Come pull yourself together You cant defend what youre
doing

STRANGWAY I do not try

MRS BRADMERE I must get you to see My father was a clergyman
Im married to one Ive two sons in the Church I know what Im
talking about Its a priests business to guide the peoples lives

STRANGWAY Very low But not mine No more

MRS BRADMERE Looking at him shrewdly Theres something very
queer about you tonight You ought to see doctor

STRANGWAY A smile awning and going on his lips If I am not better
soon

MRS BRADMERE I know it must be terrible to feel that everybody

 A convulsive shiver passes over STRANGWAY and he shrinks
 against the door

But come Live it down

 With anger growing at his silence

Live it down man You cant desert your postand let these
villagers do what they like with us Do you realize that youre
letting a woman who has treated you abominablyyes abominably
go scotfree to live comfortably with another man What an
example

STRANGWAY Will you please not speak of that

MRS BRADMERE I must This great Church of ours is based on the
rightful condemnation of wrongdoing There are times when
forgiveness is a sin Michael Strangway You must keep the whip
hand You must fight

STRANGWAY Fight Touching his heart My fight is here Have you
ever been in hell For months and monthsburned and longed hoped
against hope killed a man in thought day by day Never rested for
love and hate Icondemn Ijudge No Its rest I have to
findsomewheresomehowrest And howhow can I find rest

MRS BRADMERE Who has listened to his outburst in a soft of coma
You are a strange man One of these days youll go off your head if
you dont take care

STRANGWAY Smiling One of these days the flowers will grow out of
me and I shall sleep

 MRS BRADMERE stares at his smiling face a long moment in
 silence then with a little sound half sniff half snort she
 goes to the door There she halts

MRS BRADMERE And you mean to let all this go onYour wife

STRANGWAY Go Please go

MRS BRADMERE Men like you have been buried at crossroads before
now Take care God punishes

STRANGWAY Is there a God

MRS BRADMERE Ah With finality You must see a doctor

 Seeing that the look on his face does not change she opens the
 door and hurries away into the moonlight

 STRANGWAY crosses the room to where his wifes picture hangs
 and stands before it his hands grasping the frame Then he
 takes it from the wall and lays it face upwards on the window
 seat

STRANGWAY To himself Gone What is there now

 The sound of an owls hooting is floating in and of voices
 from the green outside the inn

STRANGWAY To himself Gone Taken faithhopelife

 JIM BERE comes wandering into the open doorway

JIM BERE Gude avenin zurr

 At his slow gait with his feeble smile he comes in and
 standing by the windowseat beside the long dark coat that still
 lies there he looks down at STRANGWAY with his lost eyes

JIM Yu threw un out of winder I cud ave once I cud

 STRANGWAY neither moves nor speaks and JIM BERE goes on with
 his unimaginably slow speech

Theym laughin at yu zurr An so I come to tell ee how to du
Twas full munewhen I caught em him an my girl I caught em
With a strange and awful flash of fire I did an I tuk un He
taken up STRANGWAYS coat and grips it with his trembling hands as a
man grips anothers neck like thatI tuk un As the coat falls
like a body out of which the breath has been squeezed STRANGWAY
rising catches it

STRANGWAY Gripping the coat And he fell

 He lets the coat fall on the floor and puts his foot on it
 Then staggering back he leans against the window

JIM Yu see I loved erI did The lost look comes back to his
eyes Then somethinI dunnoandandHe lifts his hand and
passes it up and down his side Twas like this for ever

 They gaze at each other in silence

JIM At last I come to tell yu Theym all laughin at yu But

like I did He tries again to make the sign of squeezing a mans
neck They cant laugh at yu no more then Thas what I come to

 STRANGWAY motions to him in silence And very slowly JIM
 BERE passes out

 The voices of men coming down the green are heard

VOICES Gude night Tam Glide naight old Jim

VOICES Gude might Mr Trustaford Tes a wonderful fine mune

VOICE OF TRUSTAFORD Ah Tes a brave mune for th poor old curate

VOICE My eart E lighted not

 TRUSTAFORDS laugh and the rattling fainter and fainter of
 wheels A spasm seizes on STRANGWAYS face as he stands there
 by the open door his hand grips his throat he looks from side
 to side as if seeking a way of escape


 CURTAIN



SCENE II

 The BURLACOMBES high and nearly empty barn A lantern is hung
 by a rope that lifts the bales of straw to a long ladder
 leaning against a rafter This gives all the light there is
 save for a slender track of moonlight slanting in from the end
 where the two great doors are not quite closed On a rude bench
 in front of a few remaining stacked squarecut bundles of last
 years hay sits TIBBY JARLAND a bit of apple in her mouth
 sleepily beating on a tambourine With stockinged feet GLADYS
 IVY CONNIE and MERCY TIM CLYST and BOBBIE JARLAND a boy of
 fifteen are dancing a truncated Figure of Eight and their
 shadow are dancing alongside on the walls Shoes and some
 apples have been thrown down close to the side door through
 which they have come in Now and then IVY the smallest and
 best of the dancers ejaculates words of direction and one of
 the youths grunts or breathes loudly out of the confusion of his
 mind Save for this and the dumb beat and jingle of the sleepy
 tambourine there is no sound The dance comes to its end but
 the drowsy TIBBY goes on beating

MERCY Thatll du Tibby were finished Ate yore apple The
stolid TIBBY eats her apple

CLYST In his teasing excitable voice Yu maids dont dance
elfs well as us du Bobbie es a great dancer E dance vine

 Ivy goes to flee side door and peers through

CLYST Abandoning the chase and picking up an applethey all have
the joyous irresponsibility that attends forbidden doings Yaas
this is a gude apple Luke at Tibby

 TIBBY overcome by drowsiness has fallen back into the hay
 asleep GLADYS leaning against the hay breaks into humming

 There cam three dukes aridin aridin aridin
 There cam three dukes a ridin

CLYST Old brass band shuldn wonder like th Salvation Army

IVY Putting up her hands to an imaginary pipe No tis a boy

 She marches slowly playing her imaginary pipe and one by one
 they all fall in behind her padding round the barn in their
 stockinged feet Passing the big doors IVY throws them open

An tes all like that in Eaven

 She stands there gazing out still playing on her imaginary
 pipe And they all stand a moment silent staring into the
 moonlight

CLYST Tes a glorybe full mune tonight

IVY A goldiecupa big one An millions o little goldiecups on
the floor of Eaven

MERCY Oh Bother Eaven Lets dance Clapperclaws Wake up

IVY Taking the tambourine See Tibby like this She hums and

waking has placed a piece of apple in her mouth

CONNIE Tes awful difficult this one

IVY Illustrating No yu just jump an clap yore ands Lovely
lovely

CLYST Like ringin bells Come ahn

 TIBBY begins her drowsy beating IVY hums the tune they dance
 and their shadows dance again upon the walls When she has
 beaten but a few moments on the tambourine TIBBY is overcome
 once more by sleep and falls back again into her nest of hay
 with her little shoed feet just visible over the edge of the
 bench Ivy catches up the tambourine and to her beating and
 humming the dancers dance on

 Suddenly GLADYS stops like a wild animal surprised and cranes
 her neck towards the aide door

CONNIE Whispering What is it

GLADYS Whispering I hearsome one comin across the yard

 She leads a noiseless scamper towards the shoes BOBBIE
 JARLAND shins up the ladder and seizes the lantern Ivy drops
 the tambourine They all fly to the big doors and vanish into
 the moonlight pulling the door nearly to again after them

 There is the sound of scrabbling at the hitch of the side door
 and STRANGWAY comes into the nearly dark barn Out in the night
 the owl is still hooting He closes the door and that sound is
 lost Like a man walking in his sleep he goes up to the
 ladder takes the rope in his hand and makes a noose He can
 be heard breathing and in the darkness the motions of his hands
 are dimly seen freeing his throat and putting the noose round
 his neck He stands swaying to and fro at the foot of the
 ladder then with a sigh sets his foot on it to mount One of
 the big doors creaks and opens in the wind letting in a broad
 path of moonlight

 STRANGWAY stops freeing his neck from the noose he walks
 quickly up the track of moonlight whitened from head to foot
 to close the doors

 The sound of his boots on the bare floor has awakened TIBBY
 JARLAND Struggling out of her hay nest she stands staring at
 his whitened figure and bursts suddenly into a wail

TIBBY Ooh Mercy Where are yu Im frightened Im
frightened Ooooo

STRANGWAY Turningstartled Whos that Who is it

TIBBY Ooh A ghosty Ooooo

STRANGWAY Going to her quickly Its me TibbyTib only me

TIBBY Cautiously I want my apple

 She points towards her nest STRANGWAY carries her there
 picks up an apple and gives it her TIBBY takes a bite

TIBBY I want any tambourine

STRANGWAY Giving her the tambourine and carrying her back into
the track of moonlight Now were both ghosties Isnt it funny

TABBY Doubtfully Yes

STRANGWAY See The moons laughing at us See Laugh then

 TABBY tambourine in one hand and apple in the other smiles
 stolidly He sets her down on the ladder and stands holding
 her level With him

 on to the beam

TIBBY What dyu du that for

STRANGWAY To put it out of reach Its better

TIBBY Why is it better She stares up at him

STRANGWAY Come along Tibby He carries her to the big doors and
sets her down See All asleep The birds and the fields and the
moon

TIBBY Mune mune were wishing for yu

STRANGWAY Send her your love and say goodnight

TIBBY Blowing a kiss Goodnight mune

 From the barn roof a little white doves feather comes floating
 down in the wind TIBBY follows it with her hand catches it
 and holds it up to him

STRANGWAY Taking the feather Thank you Tibby I want that bit

VOICE OF MERCY Distant and cautious Tibby Tibby Where are

STRANGWAY Mercy calling run to her

 TIBBY starts off turns back and lifts her face He bends to
 kiss her and flinging her arms round his neck she gives him a
 good hug Then knuckling the sleep out of her eyes she runs

 STRANGWAY stands uncertain There is a sound of heavy
 footsteps a man clears his throat close by

STRANGWAY Whos that

shadow of the barn That yu zurr

STRANGWAY Yes Jack How goes it

STRANGWAY Suddenly Wait for me at the crossroads Jack Ill

CREMER Sure

STRANGWAY Wait then

CREMER Aye zurr

 With his heavy tread CREMER passes on And STRANGWAY leans
 against the lintel of the door looking at the moon that quite
 full and golden hangs not far above the straight horizon where
 the trees stand small in a row

STRANGWAY Lifting his hand in the gesture of prayer God of the
moon and the sun of joy and beauty of loneliness and sorrowgive
me strength to go on till I love every living thing

 He moves away following JACK CREMER The full moon shines
 the owl hoots and some one is shaking TIBBYS tambourine
