BLACK BARTLEMYS TREASURE


PROLOGUE

The Frenchman beside me had been dead since dawn His scarred and
shackled body swayed limply back and forth with every sweep of the
great oar as we his less fortunate benchfellows tugged and strained
to keep time to the stroke

Two men had I seen die beside me yet Death ever passed me by nay it
seemed rather that despite the pain of stripes despite the travail and
hardship my strength waxed the mightier upon arm and thigh burnt
nigh black by fierce suns the muscles showed hard and knotted within
my body scarred by the lash the life leapt and glowed yet was the
soul of me sick unto death But it seemed I could not diefinding
thereby blessed rest and a surcease from this agony of life as had this
Frenchman who of all the naked wretches about me was the only one
with whom I had any sort of fellowship He had died as I say with
the dawn so quietly that at first I thought he but fainted and pitied
him but when I knew pity changed to bitterness

Therefore as I strove at the heavy oar I prayed twixt gnashing teeth
a prayer I had often prayed and the matter of my praying was thus

O God of Justice for the agony I needs must now endure for the
bloody stripes and bitter anguish give to me vengeancevengeance O
God on mine enemy

So prayed I hoarsepanting and with the sweat trickling down whiles I
stared at the naked back of him that rowed before mea great fat
fellow he had been once but now the skin hung in numberless creases
whereon were many weals some raw and bloody that crossed and
recrossed each other after the manner of lacework

Justice O God upon mine enemy Since Death is not for me let me
live until I be avenged for the pain I suffer so may I see him suffer
for the anguish that is mine so may I watch his agony Thou art a just
God so God of Justice give to me vengeance

The sun rose high and higher over our quarter beating down upon our
naked backs and adding greatly to our torments thereby waking the pain
of old stripes and lending an added sting to new

Ever and anon would come the sharp crack of the drivers whips followed
by the squealing cry of quivering flesh a cry wherein was none of the
human the which dying to a whine was lost in the stir and bustle of
the great galleass But ever and always beneath the hoarse voices of
the mariners beneath the clash of armour and tramp of feet beneath
the creak and rumble of the long oars came yet another sound rising
and falling yet never ceasing a dull low sound the like of which you
shall sometimes hear among trees when the wind is highthe deep
sobbing moan that was the voice of our anguish as we poor wretches
urged the great Esmeralda galleass upon her course

The oar whereto I was chained along with my three benchmates had at
some time been badly sprung so that the armourers had made shift to
strengthen it with a stout iron fillet some six inches wide Now it so
happened that my grasp came upon this fillet and with every stroke of
the oar day after day week in and week out it had become my wont to
rub the links of my chain to and fro across this iron band whereby
they had become very smooth and shining

The words of my prayer were yet upon my lips when chancing to look
upon one of these links I beheld that which set my heart aleaping and
my riotous blood atingle to my fingers ends yet twas a very small
thing no more than a mark that showed upon the polished surface of the
link a line not so thick as a hair and not to be noticed without close
looking but when I bore upon the link this hairline grew and widened
it needed but a sudden wrench and I should be free This threw me into
such a rapturous transport that I had much ado to contain myself
howbeit after some while I lifted my eyes to the heaven all flushed and
rosy with the young day for it seemed that God had indeed heard my
prayer

Presently along the gangway amidships comes none other than that
accursed Portugal Pedro the whipmaster who espying the drooping
form of the Frenchman beside me forthwith falls acursing in his vile
tongue and gives a prodigious flourish with his whip Now by reason of
much practice they do become very expert with these same whips
insomuch that they shall with a certain cunning flick of the lash
gash you a man as it were with a knife the like of which none may bear
and not cry out for the exceeding pain of it Ha thou lazy dog
cries he Think ye to snore and take your ease whiles Pedro is
aboard And with the word the long lash hissed and cracked upon the
Frenchmans naked back like a pistolshot

And lo he that meseemed was dead stirred I felt the scarred body
leap and quiver the swooning eyes opened rolling dim and sightless
and the pallid face was twisted in sharp anguish but even as I
watched the lines of agony were smoothed away into the wild eyes came
a wondrous light and uttering a great glad cry he sank forward across
the oarshaft and hung there Hereupon this accursed Pedro betook him
to his whip smiting right heartily but seeing the Frenchman stirred
not and perceiving moreover the blood to come but slow and in no
great quantity he presently desisted and bade us cease rowing one and
all

This sudden respite from labour served but to teach me how stiff and
painful were my limbs more especially my left wrist and ankle where
the fetters had worn great sores

The wind was fallen light and there rose that hot sickening reek that
suffocating stench that is like unto nothing on earth save one of these
floating hells and the which if a man hath but smelled it once he
shall nevermore forget

After some while back cometh Pedro with certain of the armourers and
having by divers methods learned the Frenchman was in sooth dead they
struck off his fetters hand and leg in the doing of which they must
needs free me also since we were chained together he and I and
binding a great shot to his feet made ready to heave him overboard

And now seeing no man heeded me I snapped asunder the cracked link
and was free save for the heavy chain that cumbered my leg Stooping
I lifted this chain and crouched to spring for the bulwark but now
even in this moment remembering all that I had suffered at the hands
of this most accursed Pedro I turned and wrapping the broken
oarchain about my fist crept towards where he stood to oversee the
armourers His back was towards me and I was within a yard of him when
he turned and seeing me uttered a shout and raised his whip but ere
the blow could fall I leapt and smote him My ironbound fist took him
full betwixt the eyes and looking down upon his crushed and spattered
face as he lay I knew that Pedro the whipmaster would whip men no more
these many days

Then not minded to die by the whip or upon a pikehead turned I and
sprang for the ships side but the chain about my leg hampered me
sorely and ere I could mount the high bulwark I was beset from behind
So would I have faced them and died fighting but fierce strokes
battered me to my knees fierce hands wrenched and tore at me and
grown faint with blows I was overborne my hands lashed behind me and
thus helpless I was dragged along the gangway and so up the ladder to
the poop where plain to all mens sight a whippingpost had been set
up Yet even so I struggled still panting out curses on them French
and Spanish and English drawing upon all the vile abuse of the
rowingbench and lazarette since fain would I have them slay me out of
hand the rather than endure the miseries and anguish of my lot Yet
this might not be since slaves were hard to come by and I was mighty
and strong wherefore I struggled no more but suffered them to strike
off my broken fetters and bind me to the whippingpost as they listed
Yet scarce had they made an end when there comes a loud hail from the
masthead whereupon was sudden mighty todo of men running hither and
yon laughing and shouting one to another some buckling on armour as
they ran some casting loose the great ordnance while eyes turned and
hands pointed in the one direction but turn and twist me how I might I
could see nought of any strange sail by reason of the high bulkhead
beside me

Of a sudden all voices were hushed as up the poopladder comes the
commander Don Miguel in his black armour who looking long and
steadily to windward gives a sign with his gauntleted hand whereon
divers of the officers go off hotfoot some to muster the long files
of arquebusiers others to overlook the setting of more sail and the
like And now was a prodigious cracking of whips followed by groans
and cries and screaming curses and straightway the long oars began to
swing with a swifter beat From where I stood in my bonds I could look
down upon the poor naked wretches as they rose and fell each and all
at the same moment in time to the stroke

For maybe half an hour the chase was kept up and then all at once the
decks quivered neath the discharge of one of the forward culverins
and presently as the great galleass altered her course obedient to
the motion of Don Miguels hand I beheld some halfleague to
windward the towering stern of the ship we were pursuing whose length
gradually grew upon me as we overhauled her until she was fairly in
view She was a small ship and by her build I did not doubt but that
she was English even as I watched up to her mizzenpeak fluttered the
English flag And hereupon a great yearning came upon me insomuch
that of a sudden her high weatherbeaten sides her towering masts and
patched canvas grew all blurred and indistinct

Thrice already our guns had roared yet though she was now so close
that I made out her very rope and spar she made no sign In a little
our guns fell silent also wherefore looking about I beheld Don
Miguel standing beside the tiller yet with his impassive gaze ever bent
upon the foe and as I watched I read his deadly purpose and a great
fear for the English ship came upon me and I fell apraying beneath my
breath for we carried a weapon more terrible than any culverin that
was ever cast the long sharp ram below the water

The English ship was now so near that I could see the yawning muzzles
of her guns while her high curving sides seemed to tower over us As
I gazed with my heart full of a pitiful fear for her I saw a head
appear above her quarterrailing a very round head whereon was a
mariners red cap Came a puff of smoke the sharp crack of a caliver
and one of the officers beside Don Miguel threw up his hands and
twisting on his heels fell clashing in his armour When I looked
again for the red cap it was gone But Don Miguel waited silent and
impassive as ever Suddenly he gestured with his hand I saw the heave
of the steersmens shoulders as they obeyed while the air rang with
shouts of command as the starboard oars holding water the larboard
thrashed and churned amain and the great Esmeralda galleass turning
thus wellnigh in her own length drove straight for the side of her
foe

Never had I seen it better done and I set my teeth waiting for the
grinding crash that was to send the English ship to the bottom but lo
her creaking yards were braced round and paying off before the wind
which now blew strongly she stood away upon a course at right angles
to her old whereby both vessels were running parallel as before Yet
it had been close so very close indeed that as we drove past her I
heard the sickening crack of our oars as they snapped off one after the
other against her side tossing those that manned them in bloody
struggling heaps

And now from every English gun leaped roaring flame the air was full
of shrieks and groans and the crash of splintering wood and through
the eddying smoke I could see many of our soldiery that lay in strange
contorted attitudes while others crawled sobbing on hands and knees
but on the scarletdropping rowingbenches I dared not look

Hotter waxed the fight louder swelled the din and tumult with the
neverceasing thunder of the guns and amid it all Don Miguel paced to
and fro impassive as always the blade of his long rapier gleaming
here and there as he directed the fire

Up rolled the smoke thicker and denser but ever and anon through
some rift I might catch a glimpse of the scarred blackened side of the
English ship or the litter and confusion of our decks Twice shots
ploughed up the planking hard by me and once my post itself was
struck so that for a moment I had some hope of winning free of my
bonds yet struggle how I would I could not move the which filled me
with a keen despair for I made no doubt what with the smoke and
tumult I might have plunged overboard unnoticed and belike have gained
the English ship

Slowly and by degrees our fire slackened one by one the guns fell
silent and in their place rose the more hateful sounds of anguish Now
as I stood thus my eyes smarting with burnt powder my ears yet
ringing with the din I grew aware how the deck sloped in strange
fashion at first I paid small heed yet with every minute this slope
became steeper and with this certainty came the knowledge that we were
sinking and moreover judging by the angle of the deck sinking by the
stern

Hereupon impelled by that lust of life the which is implanted in each
one of us I fell to a wild struggling against my bonds until seeing
in a little the hopelessness of this I grew resigned to despair and
ceasing my passionate efforts looked about me for the smoke was
thinned away And truly an evil sight was this great galleass with
its shottorn decks and huddled heaps of dead its litter of broken
spars and dismantled guns and with everywhere great gouts and pools of
blood while below and beyond were the shattered rowingbenches
cumbered now with awful red heaps silent for the most part yet some
there were who screamed high and shrill

Save for myself and divers of the dead the poop lay deserted but
forward such of the soldiers and mariners who yet lived were fighting
for the boats and all was riot and confusion

As I stared about me thus I espied Don Miguel lying among the wreckage
of a dismantled gun his face was towards me and looked as I had seen
it an hundred times save for a smear of blood upon his cheek Even as
I gazed his eyes met mine full and square For a moment he lay without
motion then his face atwitch with the effort he came slowly to his
elbow gazed about him and so back to me again Then I saw his hand
creep down to the dagger at his hip to fumble weakly therehowbeit
at the third essay he drew the blade and began to creep towards me
Very slowly and painfully he dragged himself along and once I heard
him groan but he stayed not till he was come within striking distance
yet was he sore wounded and so weak withal that he was fain to rest him
awhile And ever his impassive eyes looked up into mine the while I
nerved myself to meet the blow unflinching an it might be so Once
more he raised himself his arm lifted slowly the dagger gleamed and
fell its keen edge severing the cords that bound me and with a sudden
effort I broke free and stood staring down into those impassive eyes as
one in a dream Then lifting a feeble hand he pointed to the
tattered sails of the English ship hard by and so resting his head
upon his arm as one that is very weary he sighed and with the sigh I
think the life passed out of him

Turning I was upon the quarterrailing in a single leap and without
a glance at the red havoc behind me I plunged over and down

The sharp sting of the brine struck me like a myriad needlepoints but
the sweet cool of the waters was wondrous grateful to my sunscorched
body as coming to the surface I struck out for the English ship
though sore hampered by my chain

Presently coming beneath her lofty stern I found hanging therefrom a
tangle of ropes and cordage whereby I contrived to clamber aboard and
so beheld a man in a red seamans bonnet who sat upon the wreckage of
one of the quarter guns tying up a splintergash in his arm with hand
and teeth perceiving me he rolled a pair of blue eyes up at me and
nodded

Welcome aboard lad says he having knotted the bandage to his
liking Be ye one as can understand good English

Aye says I nodding

Why then bear witness as I be a patient soul and marciful Be witness
as I held my fire so long as any marciful soul might by token that I
knew what a broadside can do among crowded rowingbencheshaving rowed
aboard one o they Spanish hells afore nowso I held my fire till yon
devils craft came nigh cutting me asunderand marcy hath its limits
Timothy Spence o the Tiger master is me homeward bound for the
Port of London and by this fight am short five good men But youre a
proper big un Go forard to the bosun you shall know him by reason
that he lacketh his starboard yere Ask him for clothes to cover thy
nakedness lad andOho there goeth yon devils craft Turning as
he spoke I saw the sharp bows of the Esmeralda lift and lift high
and higher and with a longdrawn gurgling roar the great galleass
plunged down stern foremost burying her shame and misery from the eyes
of man for evermore

Thus then I sailed with Master Timothy Spence aboard the Tiger a
free man after five years of anguish



CHAPTER I

OF WHAT BEFELL ON PEMBURY HILL

It was a night of tempest with rain and wind a great wild wind that
shouted mightily near and far filling the world with halloo while
ever and anon thunder crashed and lightning flamed athwart the muddy
road that wound steeply up betwixt grassy banks topped by swaying
trees Broken twigs whirling down the wind smote me in the dark
fallen branches reached out arms that grappled me unseen but I held on
steadfastly since every stride carried me nearer to vengeance that
vengeance for the which I prayed and lived So with bared head lifted
exulting to the tempest and grasping the stout hedgestake that served
me for staff I climbed the long ascent of Pembury Hill

Reaching the summit at last I must needs stay awhile to catch my breath
and shelter me as well as I might neath the weather bank for upon
this eminence the rain lashed and the wind smote me with a fury
redoubled

And now as I stood amid that howling darkness my back propped by the
bank my face lifted to the tempest I was aware of a strange sound
very shrill and fitful that reached me twixt the booming windgusts
a sound that came and went now loud and clear anon faint and remote
and I wondered what it might be Then the rushing dark was split
asunder by a jagged lightningflash and I saw Stark against the
glare rose black shaft and crossbeam wherefrom swung a creaking shape
of rusty chains and iron bands that held together something shrivelled
and black and wet with rain a grisly thing that leapt on the buffeting
wind that strove and jerked as it would fain break free and hurl
itself down upon me

Now hearkening to the dismal creak of this chained thing I fell to
meditation This awful shape thought I had been a man once hale and
strongeven as I but this man had contravened the law even as I
purposed to do and he had died a rogues death and so hung rotting
in his chains even as this my own body might do some day And
hearkening to the shrill wail of his fetters my flesh crept with
loathing and I shivered But the fit passed and in my vain pride I
smote my staff into the mud at my feet and vowed within myself that
nought should baulk me of my just vengeance come what might as my
father had suffered death untimely and hard so should die the enemy of
my race for the anguish he had made me endure so should he know
anguish I bethought me how long and deadly had been this feud of
ours handed down from one generation to another a dark
bloodsmirched record of bitter wrongs bitterly avenged To hate like
a Brandon and revenge like a Conisby This had been a saying in our
south country upon a time and nowhe was the last of his race as I
was the last of mine and I had come back out of hell that this saying
might be fulfilled Soonha yes in a few short hours the feud
should be ended once and for all and the house of Conisby avenged to
the uttermost Thinking thus I heeded no more the raving tempest
around me until roused by the plunge and rattle of the gibbetchains
I raised my head and shaking my staff up at that black and shrivelled
thing I laughed loud and fierce and even as I did so there leapt a
great blaze of crackling flame and thereafter a thunderclap that
seemed to shake the very earth and smite the roaring wind to awed
silence and in this silence I heard a whisper

O mercy of God

Somewhere in the darkness hard by a woman had cried Instinctively I
turned thitherward searching the night vainly until the lightning
flared again and I beheld a cloaked and hooded figure huddled miserably
against the bank of the road and as darkness came I spoke

Woman doth the gibbet fright you or ist I If tis the gibbet go
hence if tis I rest assured

Who are you said a breathless voice

One of no more account than the poor thing that danceth aloft in his
chains and for you as harmless

And now she was beside me a dark windblown shape and above the
howling tempest her voice reached me in passionate pleading

Sirsir will you aid one in sore danger and distress

Yourself I questioned

Nayindeed nay she panted tis Marjorie my poor poor brave
Marjorie They stopped my coachdrunken men I know not what came of
Gregory and I leapt out and escaped them in the dark but
Marjoriethey carried her offthere is a light down the lane yonder
I followed and sawO sir you will save Marjorieyou are a man

A hand was upon my ragged sleeve a hand that gripped and shook at me
in desperate supplicationYou will save her fromfrom worse than
death Speakspeak

Lead on quoth I answering this compelling voice The griping
fingers slipped down and clasped my hand in the dark and with never
another word she led me away unseeing and unseen until we came where we
were more sheltered from rain and wind and now I took occasion to
notice that the hand that gripped mine so masterfully was small and
soft so that what with this and her voice and speech I judged her one
of condition But my curiosity went no further nor did I question her
for in my world was no place for women So she led me on at haste
despite the darklike one that was sure of her whereaboutsuntil I
suddenly espied a dim light that shone out from the open lattice of
what I judged to be a small hedgetavern Here my companion halted
suddenly and pointed to the light

Go she whispered Gonay first take this and she thrust a
small pistol into my hand Haste she panted O hasteand I do
pray God shield and bless you Then with never a word I left her and
strode towards the beam of light

Being come nigh the casement I paused to cock the weapon and to glance
at the priming then creeping to the open lattice I looked into the
room

Three men scowled at each other across a tabledesperatelooking
fellows scarred and illfeatured with clothes that smacked of the
sea behind them in a corner crouched a maid comely of seeming but
pallid of cheek and with cloak torn by rough hands and as she
crouched her wide eyes stared at the dicebox that one of the men was
shaking vigorouslya tall hairy fellow this with great rings in his
ears thus stood he rattling the dice and smiling while his companions
cursed him hoarsely

With a twist of the hand the hairy man made his throw and as the three
evil heads stooped above the dice I clambered through the window
levelled pistol in one hand heavy staff in the other

What dye set quoth I The three sprang apart and stared at me
quite chapfallen

Whats to do growled one

First your barkingironslay them here on the table and quicks the
word One after another they drew the weapons from their belts and
one by one I tossed them through the window

What quoth one a lank rogue with a patch over one eye and winking
the other jovialwise How now mate o mine shall dog bite dog then

Aye says I and with a will

Nay nay shipmate quoth another a plump small man with round
bright eyes and but one ear easy noweasy We be three lorn
mariners dye seejolly dogs bully boys shipmatea little fun wi a
pretty lassnought to harm dye see sink me Join us and welcome
says I share and share alike O

Aye Ill join you quoth I but firstyou wi the ringsopen the
door Here the hairy fellow growled an oath and reached for an empty
tankard and thereupon got the end of my staff driven shrewdly into his
midriff so that he sank to the floor and lay gasping

Nay now shipmate quoth the plump man in wheedling tone but round
eyes snapping heres lubberly manners sink and scuttle me

Open the door says I

Heartilyheartily says he his eye upon my cudgel and edging to
the door drew the bolts and set it wide

Woman quoth I run

With never a word the maid sprang erect caught her torn cloak about
her and speeding across the room was gone whereupon the lank fellow
sat him down and fell acursing viciously in Spanish and English the
plump man clicked his teeth and grinned while Rings leaning against
the wall clasped his belly and groaned

Well so my bully roarer and what now demanded the plump man
softly

Why now says I twas share and share alike I mind

Aye but shes off slipped her moorings dye see my good lad and be
damned t ye wi all my heart said the little plump man smiling but
with the devil peeping through his narrowed lids

Lookee says I laying a groat upon the table theres my allcome
turn out your pockets

Pockets murmured the plump man Lord love me whats this Heres
us cheated of a bit of daintiness heres Abner wi all the wind
knocked out o him and now heres you for thieving and robbing three
poor lorn sailormen as never raised hand agin yeshame shipmate

Od rot your bones snarled the oneeyed man and spat towards me
whereat I raised my staff and he lifting an arm took the blow on his
elbowjoint and writhed cursing but while I laughed at the fellows
contortions the plump man sprang marvellous nimble and dashed out
the light and as I stepped from before the window I heard the lattice
go with a crash of glass Followed a long tense moment wherein we all
as I judge held our breath for though the storm yet roared beyond
the shattered casement within was a comparative quiet Thus as I
stood in the dark listening for some rustle some stealthy creeping
step to guide my next blow I thrust away my pistol and changing my
staff to my right hand drew forth the broadbladed sailors knife I
carried and so waited mighty eager and alert but heard only the
faroff booming of the wind Then a floorboard creaked faintly to my
left and turning short I whirled my staff felt it strike home and
heard a fierce cry and the uneven tread of staggering feet

Fight rogues cried I Heres meat and drink to mefight and
setting my back to the wall I waited for their rush Instead I heard a
hoarse whispering lost all at once in a womans shrill scream out
beyond the casement and thereafter a loud voice that hailed

House ho House ahoy Light ho Show a glim ye drunken dogs and
here followed a rush of roaring seaoaths drowned in a scream louder
wilder than before Then while this distressful cry yet thrilled upon
the air pandemonium broke loose about me shouts cries and a rush and
trample of feet the table went over with a crash and the darkness
about me rained blows But as they struck random and fierce so struck
I and as I do think made right goodly play with my hedgestake until
caught by a chance blow I staggered tripped and falling headlong
found myself rolling upon sodden grass outside the shattered window
For a moment I lay halfdazed and found in the wind and rain vasty
comfort and refreshment

Then in the pitchy gloom hard by I heard that which brought me to my
feetan evil scuffling a close and desperate strugglinga mans
hoarse laugh and a womans pitiful pleading and sobbing I had lost my
staff but I yet grasped my knife and with this held point upwards and
my left hand outstretched before me I crept forward guided by these
sounds My fingers came upon hair a womans long soft tresses and I
remember marvelling at the silky feel of them from these my hand
slipped to her waist and found there an arm that grasped her close
then drawing back my hand I smote with my knife well beneath this arm
and drove in the stout blade twice The fellow grunted and loosing
the maid leapt full at me but I met him with clenched fist and he
went down headlong and I crouched above him and feeling him struggle
to his knees kicked him back into the mud and thereafter leapt on him
with both feet as I had been wont to do when fighting my fellowslaves
in some lazarette then seeing he stirred no more I left him
doubting nothing I had done his business Yet as I went I felt myself
shiver for though I had been compelled to fight the naked wretches who
had been my fellowslaves I had killed no man as yet

Thus as I went chancing to stumble against a tree I leaned there
awhile and now remembering those two blows under the armpit what with
this stabbing and my fall and lack of food for I had eaten but once
that day I grew faint and sick But as I leaned there out of the
gloom came a hand that fumbled timidly my bowed head my arm my hand

Sirare you hurt questioned a voice and here once again I was
struck by the strange vital quality of this voice its belllike depth
and sweetness

No whit says I Now as I spoke it chanced she touched the knife in
my grasp and I felt her shiver a little

Did youO sirdid youkill him

And wherefore no I questioned And why call me sir

You do speak as one of gentle birth

And go like the beggar I amin rags I am no sir

How may I call you

Call me rogue thief murdererwhat ye will tis all one But as
for you quoth I lifting my head tis time you were gonesee
yonder and I pointed where a light winked through the trees a light
that danced to and fro coming slowly nearer until it stopped all at
once then rose a shout answered by other shouts and a roar of dismayed
blasphemy At this my companion pressed nearer so that I felt her
shiver again

Let us be gone she whispered Marjorie come child let us
haste So we went on together at speed and ever as we went that
small soft hand was upon the hand that held the knife So we sped on
through the dark these two maids and I unseeing and unseen speaking
little by reason of our haste

Presently the rain ceased the wind abated its rage and the thunder
pealed faint with distance while ever and anon the gloom gave place to
a vague light where beyond the flying cloudwrack a faint moon
peeped

Guided by that slender hand so soft and yet instinct with warm and
vigorous life I stumbled on through leafy ways traversed a little
wood on and ever on until the trees thinning showed beyond a glimmer
of the great high road Here I stayed

Madam says I making some ado over the unfamiliar word You should
be safe nowand as I do think your road lieth yonder

Pembury is but a mile hence says she and there we may get horses
Come at least this night you shall find comfort and shelter

No says I NoI am a thing of the roads and well enough in hedge
or rick and I would have turned but her hand upon my sleeve
restrained me

Sir says she be you what you will you are a man Who you are I
know and care notbut you have this night wrought that I shall
nevermore forget and now Iwewould fain express our gratitude

Indeed and indeed said the maid Marjorie speaking for the first
time

I want no gratitude says I mighty gruff

Yet shall it follow thee for the passion of gratitude is strong and
may not be deniedeven by beggar so proud and arrogant And now
hearkening to this voice so deep and soft and strangely sweet I knew
not if she laughed at me or no but even as I debated this within
myself she lifted my hand the hand that grasped the knife and I felt
the close firm pressure of two warm soft lips then she had freed me
and I fell back a step striving for speech yet finding none

God love me quoth I at last Why must youdo so

And wherefore not she questioned proudly

Tis the hand of a vagrant an outcast a poor creeper o ditches
says I

But a mans hand she answered

Tis at hand that hath slain once this night and shall slay again ere
many hours be sped Now here I heard her sigh as one that is troubled

And yet says she gently tis no murderers hand and you that are
vagrant and outcast are no rogue

How judge ye this having never seen me I questioned

In that I am a woman For God hath armed our weakness with a gift of
knowledge whereby we may ofttimes know truth from falsehood the noble
from the base spite all their outward seeming So do I judge you no
roguea strong man but veryaye very young that belike hath
suffered unjustly and being so young art fierce and impatient of all
things and apt to rail bitterly gainst the world Ist not so

Aye says I marvelling truly tis like witchcraftmayhap you will
speak me my name At this she laughed most wonderful to hear and
vastly so to such coarse rogue as I whose ears had long been strangers
to aught but sounds of evil and foul obscenity

Nay says she my knowledge of you goeth no furtherbut and
here she paused to fetch a shuddering breath but for him you
killedthat twolegged beast You did but what I would have done
forO man had you not come II should have killed him maid though I
am See here is the dagger I snatched from his girdle as he strove
with me O take ittake it And with a passionate gesture she
thrust the weapon into my grasp

O madammy lady cried her companion Look yonder be
lightslanthorns aflare on the road Tis Gregory as I do think with
folk come to seek for us Shall we go meet them

Nay wait childfirst let us be sure So side by side we stood all
three amid the dripping trees watching the tossing lights that grew
ever nearer until we might hear the voices of those that bare them
raised ever and anon in confused shouting

Aye tis Gregory sighed my lady after some while He hath raised
the village and we are safe

Hark cried I starting forward What name do they cry upon

Mine sir

Oho my lady roared the hoarse chorus Oho my Lady Joanmy Lady
BrandonBrandonBrandon

Brandon cried I choking upon the word

Indeed sirI am the Lady Joan Brandon of Shene Manor and so long as
life be mine needs must I bear within my grateful heart the memory of

But waiting for no more I turned and sprang away into the denser
gloom of the wood And ever as I went crashing and stumbling through
the underbrush above the noise of my headlong flight rang the hated
name of the enemy I had journeyed so far to killBrandon Brandon
Brandon



CHAPTER II

HOW I HEARD A SONG IN THE WOOD AT MIDNIGHT

Headlong went I staying for nought and heedless of all direction but
presently being weary and short of breath I halted and leaning
against a tree stood thus very full of bitter thought The storm was
quite passed but a chill wind was abroad that moaned dismally while
all about me sodden trees dripped with mournful sobbing noises And
hearkening to all this what should I be thinking but of the sweet
soft tones of a womans voice that had stirred within me memories of
better days a voice that had set me to dreams of a future to fond and
foolish imaginings For though shamed and brutalised by my
sufferings I was a man and in this past hour strange though it do
seem felt scorn of myself and a yearning for higher things and all
this by no greater reason than the sound of a womans voice in the dark
and the touch of her warm lips on my handand she a Brandon And now
as the bitter mockery of it all rushed upon me fierce anger swept me
and I broke forth into vile oaths and cursings English and Spanish
foul invectives picked up from the rogues my fellows in misery and
feeling a new shame therefore did but curse the more So there
crouched I gainst the tree shivering like the miserable wretch I was
and consumed with a ravening hunger At last becoming aware that I
yet grasped a weapon in either hand I thrust my knife in my girdle and
fell to handling this other judging it by touch since it was yet too
dark for eyes to serve me And by its feel I knew it for no honest
knife here was a thing wrought by foreign hands a haft cunningly
shaped and wrought a blade curiously slender and long and threeedged
a very deadly thing I judged by the feel Now since it had no sheath
and it so sharp I twisted my neckerchief about it from pommel to
needlepoint and thrusting it into the leathern wallet at my belt
went on some way further mid the trees seeking some place where I
might be sheltered from the cold wind Then all at once I heard that
which brought me to a stand

A man was singing and at no great distance a strange merry air and
stranger words and the voice was loud yet tuneful and mellow and the
words the which I came to know all too well were these

 Cheerly O and cheerly O
 Right cheerly Ill sing O
 Whiles at the mainyard to and fro
 We watch a dead man swing O
 With a rumbelow and to and fro
 He by the neck doth swing O

 One by the knife did part wi life
 And three the bullet took O
 But three times three died plaguily
 Awriggling on a hook O
 A hook both strong and bright and long
 They died by gash o hook O

 So cheerly O and cheerly O
 Come shake a leg lads all O
 Wi a yohoho and a rumbelow
 And mainhaul shipmates haul O

 Some swam in rum to kingdom come
 Full many a lusty fellow
 And since theyre dead Ill lay my head
 Theyre flaming now in hell O

 So cheerly O so cheerly O


Waiting for no more of the vile rant I strode forward and thus
presently came on a small dell or dingle full of the light of a fire
that crackled right merrily at the which most welcome sight I made
shift to scramble down the steepy bank forthright and approached the
blaze on eager feet Drawing near I saw the fire burned within a
small cave beneath the bank and as I came within its radiance the song
broke off suddenly and a man rose up facing me across the fire and
with one hand hid under the flap of his side pocket

Fibs off your popps cull quoth in the vernacular of the roads
Heres none but a pal as lacketh warmth and a bite

Aha quoth the fellow peering across the blaze And who be you
Stand and give a show o your figurehead Obediently I stood with
hands outspread to the flame warming my shivering body at its grateful
heat

Well says I

Why quoth he nodding Youre big enough and wild enough and as
likely a cutthroat as anotherwhats the lay

The high pad says I

Where away

Tis no matter

All I asks is quoth the fellow with a quizzical look how youve
fobbed the nubbingcheat so long

And what I ask is quoth I how a sailorman comes to know the
patter o the flash coves

Tis no matter says he but since youre o the Brotherhood sit ye
and welcome tis dry enough here in this cave

Staying for no second bidding I entered the little cave and sat me down
in the comforting warmth of the fire The man was a comely fellow of a
hectoring swashing air bright of eyes and instant of gesture close
to hand lay a short cuttingsword pistols bulged his deep
coatpockets while betwixt his knees was a battered casebottle

Well says he eyeing me over whats the word

Food says I

Nary a bite he answered shaking his head But heres rum now if
youve a mind to sluice the ivoriesha

Not a drop says I

Good The more for me he nodded Rumha

Some swam in rum to kingdom come

You sing a mighty strange song quoth I

Hadye like it

No I dont

And wherefore no

There seems overmuch death in it

Death cries he with a great laugh and hugging his casebottle
Death says youaye aye says I and so there is death in every line
ont Tis song as was made for dead men of dead men by a dead man
and theres for ye now Here he lifted the bottle drank and
thereafter smacked his lips with great gusto Made by a dead man he
repeated for dead men of dead men and theres for ye

I like your song less and less

Youve a cursed queasy stomach I think he hiccupped

And an empty one says I

Tis a song well bethought on byby better men nor you for all your
size says he glancing at me over his bottle with a truculent eye
and though his glance was steady I perceived the drink was affecting
him more and more Aye many a better man he nodded frowning

As who I questioned

First theres Abnegation Mings as you shall hear tell of on the Main
from Panama to St Catherines aye by the horns of Nick there be none
of all the coastwise Brotherhood quicker or readier when theres aught
i the wind than Abnegation and you can lay to that my delicate cove

And whos he

Myself Here he took another draught and nodded at me in drunken
solemnity And lookee my dainty cull when youve seen as much o
death as Abnegation Mings youll know as Deaths none so bad a thing
so long as it leaves you alone And I for one say tis a good song and
theres for ye

And who else

Well theres Montbars as do they call the Exterminator and theres
young Harry Morgana likely lad and theres Roger Tressady and Sol
Aiken and Penfeathersink him

And Abner said I at a venture

Aye for sure he nodded and then Ha dye know Abner then

Ive met him

Where away

In a tavern some mile hence

A tavern quoth he A tavern od rot em and heres me hove short
in this plaguy hole A tavern and heres my bottle outdog bite me
But a mouthful leftwell heres to a bloody shirt and the Brotherhood
o the Coast

You drink to the buccaneers I think says I

And what if I do

Tis said they be no better than pirates

Would ye call me a pirate then cried he scowling

I would Quick as flash he clapped hand to pocket but the pistol
caught on the lining and before he could free it I had covered him
with mine whereat he grew suddenly rigid and still Up wi your
fambles says I Obediently he raised his hands and taking his
pistols I opened the pan of each one and having blown out the
primings tossed them back

Snake sting me says he laughing ruefully as he repocketed his
weapons This comes o harbouring a lousy rogue as balks good liquor
The man as wont take good rum hath the head of a chicken the heart of
a yellow dog and the bowels of a wworm and bonerot him says I
Lord love me but Ive seen many a better throat than yours slit ere
now my buxom lad

And aided too belike says I

Why heres a leading questionbut mum Heres a hand that knoweth
not what doth its fellowmum boy mum And tilting back his head he
brake forth anew into his villainous song

 Two on a knife did end their life
 And three the bullet took O
 But three times three died plaguily
 Awriggling on a hook O
 Sing cheerly O and cheerly O
 They died by gash o hook O

And lookee my ben cull if I was to offer ye all Bartlemys
treasurewhich I cant mark mestill youd never gather just what
manner o hook that was Anan says youmum boy says I Howbeit I
say tis a good song quoth he blinking drowsily at the fire
heres battle int murder and sudden death and whawhat more could
ye expect of any songaye and theres women int too Here he fell
to singing certain lewd ribaldry that I will not here set down until
what with the rum and the drowsy heat of the fire that I had
replenished he yawned stretched and laying himself down very soon
fell asnoring to my no small comfort As for me I sat there waiting
for the dayspring the fire sank lower and lower filling the little
cave with a rosy glow falling athwart the sprawling form of the sleeper
and making his red face seem purplish and suffused like the face of one
I had once seen dead of strangulation howbeit he slept well enough
judging from his lusty snoring Now presently in the surrounding dark
beyond the smouldering fire was a glimmer a vague blur of sloping
trampled bank backed by misty trees so came the dawn very chill and
full of eddying mists that crawled phantomlike filling the little
dingle brimful and blotting out the surrounding trees In a little I
arose and coming without the cave shivered in the colder air shaken
with raging hunger And now remembering my utter destitution I stooped
to peer down at the sleeper half minded to go through his pockets but
in a while I turned away and left him sprawled in his sottish slumber



CHAPTER III

TELLS HOW I STOLE MY BREAKFAST

The mist lay very thick all about me but when I had climbed to higher
ground it thinned away somewhat so that as the pallid light grew I
began to see something of the havoc wrought by the storm here and
there lay trees uprooted while everywhere was a tangle of broken
boughs and trailing branches insomuch that I found my going no small
labour But presently as I forced a way through these leafy tangles
the birds awaking began to fill the dim world with blithe chirpings
that grew and grew to a sweet clamour ever swelling until the dark
woods thrilled with gladsome music and I beholding the first beam of
sun felt heartened thereby spite my lack of sleep and the gnawing of
hungers sharp fangs and hastened with blither steps Thus in a while
I brake forth of the desolate trees and came out upon a fair rolling
meadow with blooming hedgerows before me and beyond the high road
And now as I stayed to get my bearings up rose the sun in majesty all
glorious in purple and pink and gold whose level beams turned the
world around me into a fair garden all sweet and fresh and green
while in the scowling woods behind the sullen mists crept furtive
away till they were vanished quite and those leafy solitudes became a
very glory

But my hunger was very sore a need I purposed to satisfy soon and at
all hazards therefore having marked my direction I went at speed
and crossing the meadow came into the highway and struck south On
my going through the woods I had chosen me a cudgel in place of the one
lost shortish and knotted and very apt for quick wristplay and I
plucked forth my sailors knife meaning to trim my staff therewith but
with it poised in my hand I stopped all at once for I saw that the
point of the stout blade the which I had sharpened and whetted to an
extreme keenness I perceived I say that the blade was bent somewhat
and the point turned hooklike Now as I strode on again the early
sun flashing back from the steel I fell to wondering how this had
chanced and bethinking me of those two deadly blows I had struck in
the dark I scrutinised my knife blade and haft yet found nowhere on
it any trace of blood so that twas manifest the fellow had worn some
protectionchainshirts were common enough and many a rogue went with
a steel skull to line his hat So it seemed the fellow lived yet and
black rogue though he was I was vaguely glad twas not my hand had
sent him to his account

I was yet revolving the matter in my mind when I heard a loud and merry
whistling and glancing up beheld a country fellow approaching down a
side lane He wore a wideeaved hat and his smock was newwashed and
speckless but that which drew and held my eyes that which brought me
to a sudden stand was the bundle he bore wrapped in a fair white
clout So with my gaze on this I stood leaning on my knotted
untrimmed staff waiting him Suddenly chancing to turn his head he
espied me halted in his stride then eyeing me askance advanced
again A small man he was with rosy face little merry eyes and a
wide upcurving mouth

Goo marnin to eeit do have been a turble bad starm las night
master

Aye says I and my heart warmed to him by reason of his good Kentish
tonguethe like of which I had not heard these many weary years but
at sight of that whiteclouted bundle my mouth watered and hunger
gnawed with sharper tooth What have ye here I questioned touching
this with my staff

Nout but my dinner master s ever was

Nay says I scowling I think not

Aye but it be master he nodded Bread and beef wi a mossel of
cheese like s ever was

Bread says I Beef Cheese Liarhere is no dinner o yours

Aye master but it do be so sure quoth he staring My very own
dinner cut by my very own darter beef an bread an a mossel o
cheeseI take my bible oath t it I dobread an beef an a mossel

Show me With notable haste he undid the wrapping discovering a
good halfloaf a thick slice of roast beef and a slab of yellow cheese

Ha man quoth I twixt shut teeth So you lied to me then

Lied to ee master says he faintly

You told me twas your dinner

Aye and so it be so it be I lay my oathbeef dye see an a
mossel

Nay says I gathering up the viands heres my breakfast

Is it says he gaping

It is Would ye deny it

Not for a moment says he eyeing my staff and the gleaming knife in
my belt Lordy no Only how was I to know twere yourn
masterwhen my darter cut it for her very own feyther

We live and we learn says I turning away What might your name
be

Fullojy Tucker master

Why then Fullofjoy though my gain be your loss take comfort in
that tis more blessed to give than receive Moreover though you lack
a dinner you have a daughter and a roof to shelter you and I neither
one nor othera poor hungry rogue Methinks of the two of us you
have the better of life

Why lookee now master says he scratching his shaven chin since
youve got your breakfus surely if youre minded t step along t my
cottage down t lane I can give ye a jug of good ale to wash it down
Now as he spoke thus seeing the sturdy manliness of him I dropped my
staff and reached out my hand

Fullofjoy says I a starving man must eat by hook or crook but
if youll give your honest hand to a thieftheres mine

The man stared from my hand to my face his wide mouth curved then
rubbing hand on snowy smock he grasped my fingers and wrung them
heartilya clean and honest grip such as I had not known for many a
long day

Will ee come master he questioned I shook my head Quoth I

You have a daughter and Im no fit company for a good sweet maidnor
ever shall be for that matter So saying I dropped his hand and
turning strode away down the road his dinner beneath my arm and when
at last I glanced back I saw him standing where I had left him staring
after me chin in hand Presently turning in at a gate beside the way
I sat down beneath a hedge in the warm level beams of the sun and fell
to eating with huge appetite and stolen though it was never tasted
food more sweet I was thus rapturously employed when I heard a
dolorous whine and starting about beheld a ragged creature on the
opposite side of the hedge who glared at the food with haggard eyes and
reached out clawlike hands in supplication

O for the love o Christ spare a crust she wailed Spare a bite
to a grannam as dieth o hunger O sweet Jesua mouthful to a poor
soul as do be pined for lack o food

Off cries I fiercely What know you of hunger Away hag and I
reached for my staff whereupon she wailed and wept and clawing her
dismal rags about her crept away moaning

But now while my jaws champed ravenously the food had lost its savour
wherefore I cursed and choked and springing to my feet made after
her but seeing me follow at speed she cried out in fear and
striving to flee from me sank on feeble knees

Old hag quoth I Be damned for spoiling a hungry mans appetite and
robbing him of what he was at pains to rob for himself Then I thrust
the wellfilled napkin into her clutching fingers and hasted away but
her raptured cry followed me as I went

I trudged on slow and heavy through the mud being very weary for lack
of sleep and mightily down cast heedless of gladsome morn and the
fair fresh world about me conscious but of my own most miserable
estate insomuch that I presently sank down on the grass by the road
and with heavy head bowed between my hands gave myself up to black
despond

But now as I sat thus very sick and sorrowful I heard a sound of
wheels and plodding hoofs drawing slowly near and lifting my head at
last espied a great wain piled high with fragrant hay whereon the
driver sprawled asleep a great fat fellow whose snores rose above the
jingle of harness and creak of wheels Now hearkening to his snoring
beholding him so gross and fullfed and I starving my sadness gave
place to sudden hot anger and as the waggon lumbered by I swung
myself up behind and clambering over the hay raised my staff minded
to drub the fellow into wakefulness but even then I stayed the blow
for I spied a wallet that hung to the drivingseat a large wallet of
plump and inviting aspect Reaching it down I opened it forthwith and
found therein a newbaked loaf a roast capon delicately browned and a
jar of small beer And now couched luxuriously among the hay I fell
to work tooth and nail and though I ate in voracious haste never
before or since have I tasted aught so delicate and savoury as that
stolen fowl I was yet busied with what remained of the carcass when
the fat fellow choked in his snoring sighed grunted propped himself
on lazy elbow and catching sight of me fell agaping So whiles he
watched openmouthed I finished what remained of the capon and tossed
the bones over the hedge

Ecod quoth he faintly O ecodmy dinner As for me having my
mouth full I spake not Ads bobs says he A rascally robbing
thief of the roads

Even so I nodded and took a long draught of his beer

Aeating and adrinking of a honest mans dinner by the Lord says
he clenching fat fists O ecoda hellfire roguea very lousy
scurvy dog as shall be carted and whipped and set in Sir Richards new
pillory At this being engaged with the bread I reached out my foot
and kicked him very featly in the belly whereat he gasped and
growing thoughtful dolefully watched me make an end

If there is aught left to eat says I show it me

As fine a capon as was ever plucked by the Lord he groaned

Most true says I stretching myself in the hay

O quoth he as to himself O the pity ontso foul an end to so
fair a bird

Never whine says I but tell me how far hence lieth Lamberhurst

Better nor six mile he sighed heaving himself into the drivingseat

Why then do you carry me thither

Ads love he mourned Tis manifest shame a rogue should thieve
the food of an honest mana man like I be as do slave morning noon
and

Slave says I frowning What know you of slavery Be curst for a
great fat fool that speaketh lies Now watching him as I lay I saw
his hand close stealthily on his heavy whip but or ever he could turn
to strike I rose and fetched him a buffet neath the ear that pitched
him sprawling upon the broad backs of his horses whence with much
groaning and puffing he presently got him safely into the road seeing
the which I took the reins whipping the team to faster gait so that
to keep pace he must needs trot it in the mud

Hold cries he What would ye wi my waggon

Ride in t

Hold Then suffer me to ride likewise for Im scant o breath

Good Ive been scant o breath ere now

Show a little pity master he groaned

None ever showed pity on me

Nay butwhat harm have Ieverdone thee

Begrudged food to a starving wretch

Twas my dinner and I do need a deal of feeding I Lord how I
sweat Prithee master let me up How have I deserved this

Called me rogue and thief

Aye that I didto my woe Aye rogue I named thee and
likewiselousy knaveand grieve fort now I do

And so needs must you sweat awhile says I

And thus I aloft and at mine ease and the fat fellow trotting
breathless at the wheel we went awhile and never another word until
what with fear of losing his goods what with the mud and heat and
sweat the poor gross fool looked wellnigh spent and all foredone as I
had seen many a better man than he whereupon I brought the waggon to
a stand and reached down to stir him where he lent halfswooning across
the wheel

Harkee fool dost know of one called Brandon of Shene hereabouts

Aye trulytruly he gasped I do knowSir Richardpassing well
Ads bobs my innards be all shook tpieces and I do be parched wi
thirst

Why then up with you says I and giving him my hand aided him back
to the drivingseat Being there he sighed groaned and cast a
yearning eye towards his wallet

Parched wi thirst I be he groaned

Ive been the like ere now says I and having gulped down what
remained of the fellows beer I tossed the jar into the road whereat
he beat his breast

My beer he wailed And I afamishing wi thirst O my beer

Theres sweet water i the brook yonder says I

You be a chap wi no bowels for sure he cried Aye a hard man
you be

Tis a hard world says I but tis no matter for that tell me of
Sir Richard Brandon

Why then you must know I am Myles Trueman

And truly man there be miles of you but tis no matter for that
eitherwhat of Sir Richard

I do be coming to he says Trueman in surly tone I do farm Sir
Richards landa hard man see you though just

Soheres another hard man

Though a justaye and a godly He hath restored our church
weathercock an all an set up a fine large and fair pillory on the
green Lunnon couldnt show a finer wi stocks an cuckingstool
complete and rare to fancy

And findeth he the wherewithal to fill em

That doth he Aha there be never a vagrant gipsy nor beggar dare
come anigh in Sir Richards time And witches be few hereabouts since
old Mother Mottridge was ducked and scolds and shrews be fewer by
reason o the brank dye see

Hum says I a right proper gentleman this

Aye quoth Trueman nodding until his fat cheeks quivered and one
that doth abhor vagrants and suchlike vermin

As myself says I To this Trueman answered nothing but fell
afanning himself with his hat again eyeing me warily the while

Art strange in these parts he questioned

Aye and no

Hast met Sir Richard

I have

Aha quoth the fellow nodding He had ye whipped belike

He did so

For stealing of a fine fat capon belike

Nay twas for another matter But what of him is he hale o body
rich and well esteemed is he strong in friends and a power at court
yet

No says Trueman flicking his plodding horses Neither one nor
tother

Hownot quoth I And wherefore

Because hes dead

Dead says I starting up Dead

Why lookee if he aint deadleastways But here I seized him by
the throat and twisting him round shook him to and fro till he choked

Roguedamned rogue I cried twixt gnashing teeth Will ye mock me
then

Nono he gasped

Then tell me ye liedconfess

Aye ayeIll confessanythinganything ye will master

Then Sir Richard lieth snug in his manor of Shenedoth he not Aye or
no

Ayeaye at Sheneat Shene Hereupon I loosed him and falling
back on the hay found myself all breathless and shaking as with an
aguefit And these tremors were within me as without since by
reason of this fellows lying words I had for one black moment
doubting Gods justice seen as it were my countless anguished
supplications for vengeance on mine enemy so much vain breath and this
my toilsome journey a labour to no purpose But now bowing my head I
who knew no forgiveness humbly prayed forgiveness of God for my
doubting of God and passionately besought Him that He would cherish
mine enemy and save him in health And this to no other end but that I
myself might destroy him

His life O Godgive this mans life into mine hand So prayed I
in my vain pride and selfish blindness as I jogged along that sunny
midsummer morn and thereafter my trembling having passed from me I
stretched myself out amid the hay and fell to blissful slumber

Now to all such as reading this my narrative shall contemn and abhor me
for the purblind fool and poor desperate wretch I was and who living
but for murder could cry thus on God for the blood of his
fellowmanto all such I would say that none can despise me more
utterly than I who write these words For life since then hath learned
me many truths and in some few things I am mayhap a little wiser

But because I was proud and stubborn beyond belief because hate
begetteth hate and evilevil so came I to consort and make fellowship
with pirates and the like rogues and to endure much of harms and
dangers as battle shipwreck prison and solitude until God of His
infinite mercy brought me forth a better man therefor and in some
sense a more worthy All of the which I have fully and faithfully
recorded for such as shall trouble to read this narrative to the end

And so will I again to my story



CHAPTER IV

TELLETH HOW I MET ONE ADAM PENFEATHER

I awoke to find the waggon at a standstill and Master Trueman watching
me with a scowl the while his plump fingers toyed lovingly with his
whipstock but as I roused this hand crept up to finger his several
chins

Yonder lieth Lamberhurst quoth he sulkily and nodded where in the
valley below was a village with a green wherein was a placid pool
shaded by trees and about this green stood whitewalled cottages many
of them bowered in roses or honeysuckle to the very thatch right
pleasant to the eye while beyond these again rose gables of barns or
the pointed roofs of oasthouses Lamberhurst says Trueman again
whereon having yawned and stretched myself I clambered down into the
road

Well I questioned seeing how he watched me triple chin in hand

Well quoth he stoutly I be wondering what the likes o you should
be wanting wi the likes o Sir Richard Brandon o Shene

Nought but this says I shaking the hay from my tattered cloak I
am come to watch him die and the manner of it shall mayhap be
something slow and painful and speaking I clenched my right hand to
a sunburnt fist Now looking on this clutching hand Trueman blinked
and saying no word whipped his horses and the heavy wain rumbled and
creaked on its way But when he had gone some distance he grinned at
me over his shoulder and called something whereof I caught the words
labour lost For a moment I was minded to run after and demand his
meaning howbeit in a little I turned and went down the hill very
full of thought

Reaching the village I found it not yet astir for the clock of the
church tower showed the time was but half after four and now leaning
on my staff I stared up at the church tower with its new weathercock
brave with gilding agleam in the early sun and from thence turned my
gaze where hard beside the pool upon the green rose the grim shape of
Sir Richards new pillory Just now it stood untenanted and I wondered
idly what unhappy wight was destined next to suffer there Thus stood
I some while staring round me on this peaceful hamlet where all save
only myself forgot their cares awhile in blessed sleep the wide road
the gabled cottages oasthouse and fragrant rick yardall was as I
minded it five weary years since nothing strange was there saving
only Sir Richards hateful pillory wherefore I smote it with my staff
and cursing him that set it there turned away

Now within a stonescast of the church was a goodly tavern with a
weatherbeaten signboard aswing above the door whereon was painted
what purported to be a leopard asleep and below the following legend
viz

 ROUSE ME NOT

and below this again

 YE CONISBY ARMS

From this I glanced at the third finger of my left hand which was a
battered signet ring that bore the semblance of another sleeping
leopard and the like inscription and looking from the sleeping leopard
on the signboard to the sleeping leopard on my ring I fell to deep and
gloomy thought Howbeit rousing in a while I perceived a
horsetrough hard by full of clean water and came thither minded to
wash the dust and sweat from me But stooping I paused and stood
thus staring down at the face that scowled up at me a face lean and
haggard with wide fierce eyes agleam beneath knitted brows a
prominent nose and square chin with short peaked golden beard an
unlovely face framed in shaggy yellow hair patched and streaked with
silver and beholding lowering brow and ferocious mouth and jaw I stood
awhile marvelling at the illchanges evil and hardship had wrought in
me

For thus was it that I first beheld myself after five years of slavery

Having looked my fill I nodded grimly at my watery image and plunged
my face and head within the trough to my great refreshment which done
I made shift to dry myself on my tattered shirt Thereafter coming to
the broad oak settle beside the tavern door I sat down and fell to
meditation But now moved by sudden impulse I unbuckled the wallet
at my girdle and taking thence the strange dagger unwound the
neckerchief that swathed it and began to examine the weapon first
carelessly enough then with growing interest and wonder The blade
as I have told elsewhere was triangular of form very narrow and some
eight inches in length and exceeding sharp of point but that which
drew and held my gaze was the wonder of its haft I have seen and
handled many fair weapons in my day but never before or since have I
beheld such rare craftsmanship as went to the chiselling of this hilt
Of silver it was wrought into the shape of a standing woman her feet
poised upon the small chiselled crossguard her head forming the
pommel naked she stood in languorous pose arms raised and hands
locked behind her head The delicate chiselling of the features was
worn somewhat by handling and rough usage but even so the evil beauty
of the face was plain and manifest the wanton languor of the long
eyes the mocking cruelty of the smiling mouth The longer I viewed
it the more manifest became the nameless evil of the thing so that I
was greatly minded to whirl it into the horsepond and be done with it
But bethinking me of my destitution and not doubting but that I might
find a ready market for a thing so rare I lapped it up again and
thrusting it back into my wallet stretched myself out upon the broad
settle and presently fell asleep

But even as I slept methought I was back in torment I seemed to
hear again the crack of whips the harsh cries of the drivers the
shrill screams and curses the long groaning breaths with the rattle
and creak of the great oars as they swung ceaselessly back and forth
nay I could even feel the kick of the oarshaft that had escaped my
fainting grasp So real was it all that I waked groaning as I had
done many a time and oft waked to find the kindly sun making a glory
about me and a blackbird hard by apiping most sweet to hear while
before me stood a little thin fellow in a broadeaved steeplecrowned
hat who peered at me through narrowed eyes and poked at me with a
stick

And hows the wind shipmate he questioned I sat up and scowled
whereupon he tucked the stick beneath an arm and stood viewing me chin
in hand You sleep mighty sound says he here Ive stood apoking
at ye with my stick dye see and you snore but the louderor was it
groans

For the which poking Im minded to throw you into the horsepond

Why thats as may be says he falling back a step But no
offence shipmate

Then leave me in peace And I laid me down again

You sleep mighty sound says he and your bed none so easy

Ive known worse

Ayethe rowingbench of a Spanish floating hell shipmateha

At this I started and turned to look at him again He was as I say
a little man and clad in suit of russetbrown very trim and sober
but at his hip he bore a long rapier or tuck while in his ears which
were trimmed to points in mighty strange fashion swung great gold
rings such as mariners do wear his face was lean and sharp and wide of
mouth and lighted by very quick bright eyes seeming to take in all
things with swiftdarting glances A scar that ran from brow to chin
lent to him a certain hangdog air as to his age it might have been
thirty or forty or sixty for though he seemed vigorous and active
with smooth unwrinkled face his hair was snowwhite

Well shipmate he questioned meeting my searching gaze and how
dye like me

No whit

Sink me but thats plain enough says he smiling ruefully So
theres nought in me as draws you then

No

Tis pity for Ive a feeling we shall sail aboard ship together yet

How should you know Ive rowed aboard a Spanish ship

You bear the mark shipmate as you lay agroaning in your sleep I
took occasion to cast an eye over ye dye see and what wi the
newhealed scars on your wrist your sunburnt skin and the desperate
sinkorswim look o you I judged you newbroke from slavery and named
a Spanish galleass at a venture dye see

You are an observant man it seems says I frowning

I have a way o putting one and one togethertis a trick Ive found
useful now and then

Ha says I mighty scornful Youll be telling me my own name next

Why as to that says he pinching his long cleanshaven chin
thoughtfully how would Conisby suit

Damned spy I cried and caught him in my grip the fellow never so
much as flinched and there was something formidable in his very
quietude

Easy all shipmate says he mildly and staring up at me eye to eye
Use me kindly for Im a timid soul with a good heart meaning no
offence

How learned ye my name What devilry is here

None in the world Lord love ye Tis just my trick of adding one and
one dye see Theres the ring on your finger and the signboard above
you

And wherefore spy on a sleeping man

Because Im a lonely soul doth seek a comrade Because the moment I
clapped eyes on you I felt drawn to ye and seeing the scars on your
wrist knew em for shacklemarksand twas a bond betwixt us

How a bond

Loose me shipmate and Ill show ye Which done he bared a long
and sinewy arm discovering thereon marks of old fettersores like
those upon my own

So youve slaved at an oar then says I

Aye shipmate

Endured the shame of stripes and nakedness and filth

Aye shipmate And more Ive fought for my life on the Inca
Deathstone ere now as you may see by my ears if you know aught of the
Maya Indians

And here without so much as a by your leave he sat him down on the
bench beside me and leaning forward began to trace idle patterns in
the dust with his stick

Shipmate says he Im a timid man

As a snake quoth I and as deadly

Here he stayed his drawing to glance at me askance to sigh and shake
his head You misjudge me says he howbeit well say cautiousa
cautious man with an honest kindly heart as yearns to fellowship

And with a pistol neath each armpit

True he nodded I might ha shot ye a moment since and
didntwhich doth but prove my words for Im one as never harmed any
manwithout just causesave once and that here he sighed was
years agone And me a lonely man to this day So tis I seek a
comradea right man one at odds wi fortune and the world and
therefore apt to desperate ploys one hath suffered and endured and
therefore scornful of harms and dangers one as knoweth the sea Now
let that man pledge me the bloodbrotherhood let him stand staunch and
faithful blow fair blow foul and Ill help him to a fortune greater
than ever came out of Manoa El Dorado or the Indies Come what dye
say friend

I say sheer off and leave me to my sleep lest I mischief you

Ha ye no lust for riches then

No more than I have to your company and I love that less and less

Tis pity says he shaking his head Aye tis pity for I do like
you more and more such a fine bloodandbeef dareandbedamned
gibbetlike figure of a rogue shipmate as would grace a crossroads
better than most which is one reason I was drawn to ye dye see I
being a quiet soul

And a pirate like as not

Easy shipmate easy Passion is an ill word to steer by And Im a
lonely man as seeks a comrade

And Im a lonely man that loveth solitude so een now will I go seek
it and I rose

Stay a bit shipmate haul your wind and listen says he laying hand
on my arm Stand in wi me blow high blow low and I offer
youwealth untoldriches fortune

Tush says I empty things all At this his hold tightened while
his keen gaze held mine

More than this says he slowly I offer you rank honours power and
mayhaplove shipmate

Enough quoth I You offer nought I desire

Why then says he in the Fiends name what would ye have

Vengeance I answered and shaking off his grasp I turned and strode
away along the dusty road



CHAPTER V

HOW I CAME TO CONISBY SHENE

It being yet full early for my purpose I took to the woods and
presently chancing upon a little stream that bubbled pleasantly mid
shady willows I sat myself down within this greeny bower and fell to
watching the hurrying waters of this brook and hearkening to its drowsy
murmur And lying thus with the good green world around me the sunny
air blithe with the mellow piping of birds and the soft wind rustling
the leaves about mewhat must I have in mind but bloodshed and the
destruction of my enemy insomuch that reaching a stone from the brook
I drew the knife from my girdle and set about straightening the blade
thereof

I was thus employed when all at once the leaves on the opposite side of
the brook were parted and a girlchild appeared For a long moment we
eyed each other across the brook then all at once her pretty lips
curved to a smile

Little maid says I furtively thrusting the knife into my belt art
not afraid of me then

Nay she answered smiling yet and shaking her golden head

And why

I do like your eyes big man kind eyes they be

Are they says I glancing from her smiling innocence into the brook

Aye and your voiceI do like that tootis low and softlike
fathers

And whos your father

He be th blacksmith

How old are you

Seven an a big maid I be Will ee aid me cross tbrook now

So I lifted her over and there we sat side by side she laughing and
talking and I hearkening to her childish prattle with marvellous great
pleasure Presently I ventured to touch her soft cheek to stroke her
curls and finding she took this not amiss summoned courage to stoop
and kiss her

How long we had sat thus I know not when I was aroused by a shrill
harsh voice and turning beheld a bony woman who peered at us through
the leaves

Susan Ann she cried O you Susan come away Come quick or Ill
run for your mother

The child is safe enough says I frowning but clasping the small
damsel closer within my arm

Safe cries the woman turning on me in fury Safeaye for sooth
wi a great ill rogue the like o you Loose herloose her or Ill
scream and rouse the village on ye for a wild gipsy wastrel that ye
are And here the old harridan railed at me until the child whimpered
for fear and even I blenched before the womans fierce aspect and
shrewish tongue Then while she loaded me with abuse a ceaseless
torrent and no lack of breath I kissed the little maids tearwetted
cheek and setting her back across the brook stood to watch until the
child and woman were lost to my sight Then I sat down scowling at
the hurrying water chin on fist for my black humour banished awhile
by the childs innocent faith in me was returned and therewith an
added bitterness Scowling yet I plucked forth my knife and seizing
my staff set to trim and shape it to a formidable weapon and as I
worked I cursed this woman deep and oft yet even so knew she had the
right ont for truly I was a rogue an outcast of unlovely look and
unlovely ways a desperate fellow unfit for the company of decent folk
much less an innocent child and yet remembering those fearless
childeyes the kiss of those pure childlips I sighed amain betwixt my
muttered cursings

At last having trimmed my bludgeon to a nicety I laid it by and sat
brooding the knife betwixt my knees now a beam of sun falling athwart
the leaves lit upon the broad blade of the knife and made of it a
glory And beholding this and the hand that grasped it I took
pleasure to heed how strong and sinewy were my fingers and how the
muscles bulged beneath the brown skin of my forearm and turning the
glittering steel this way and that I fell to joyous thought of my enemy
and of my vengeance now so near

Tonight says I to myself Death ever cometh with more terrors in
the dark Tonight But now little by little my joy gave place to
anger that the night must be so long acoming and glancing up I
cursed the sun that it must needs shine and the gladsome day that it
was not grim night And presently to anger was added a growing fear
lest mine enemy might by some hap elude me at the eleventh
hourmight even now be slipping from my reach Now at this a sweat
brake out on me and leaping to my feet I was minded to seek him out
and end the matter there and then Why wait for tonight I asked
myself Surely in the gladsome light of day Death findeth an added
bitterness Why wait for night then

So I stood awhile debating within myself then catching up my knotted
bludgeon I set off along the stream incontinent following a path I
had trodden many a time when but a lad a path that led on through mazy
thickets shady dells and green coppices dappled with sunlight and glad
with the trilling melody of birds but ever as I went before my eyes
was a man who twisted in my grasp and died over and over again and in
my ears the sounds of his agony And ever as I went trees reached out
arms as if to stay me and bushes stretched forth little thorny fingers
that caught my garments as if to hinder me from my purpose But I
brushed them aside with my scarred arms or beat them down with my heavy
staff oerleaping hedge and ditch and fallen tree until I reached the
highway and even as I came there a distant clock chimed the hour of
ten I quickened my pace twirling my staff as I went so that the two
or three wayfarers I chanced to meet drew from my neighbourhood and
eyed me mightily askance Having gone thus some mile or so I came to
a wall that bordered the road a high and mossy wall and following
this to a pair of gates set well back from the highway with pillars
of stone each surmounted by a couchant leopard carved in the stone
Now these gates were of iron very lofty and strong and fast shut but
besides these was a smaller gate or postern of wood hard by the
gatehouse where stood a lusty fellow in fair livery picking his teeth
with a straw and staring at the square toes of his shoes Hearing me
approach he glanced up and frowning shook his head and waved me away

Heres no road for the likes o you said he while I was yet at some
distance Off wi you Howbeit seeing I still advanced he clapped
to the gate and letting fall the bar cursed me roundly through the
grille

I would see Sir Richard Brandon says I

Then ye cantnowise So be off and be danged

Open the gate says I

Be hanged for a murderouslooking rogue a lousy thief a wastrel and
a hangdog knave says he all in a breath

All true enough says I And now open the gate

Be danged for a prigging gipsyA Gad Ill have ye clapped i the
pillory for a blackvisaged clapperclaw

Unbar says I Or it shall go plaguy ill wi you when I come in

At this he spat upon me through the grille and chuckled Now glancing
about I espied a stone hard by about the bigness of a mans head and
laying by my staff I wrenched the stone from where it lay and raising
it aloft hove it with all my strength whereon the gate crashed open
so suddenly as to catch the fellow a buffet that laid him sprawling on
his back and as he strove to rise I pinned him down with my staff and
kicked him heartily

And now says I up with you and bring me to your master

But or ever he could do aught but groan and rub his hurts I heard the
sound of approaching hoofstrokes and turning beheld a lady bravely
mounted who galloped furiously towards us down the avenue When almost
upon us she swung her powerful beast aside and checking him with
strong wrist sat looking down at me from the shade of her plumed hat

What is this she demanded and her eyes swept over me grey and wide
and fearless Whowho are you

Now at the sound of her voice so rich and wondersweet I felt
strangely abashed and finding no word turned from her to scowl down
at the man I had pinned beneath my broken shoe

Who are you she questioned again Speak

A rogue says I keeping my head averted A creeper o hedges

Ahist you said she in softer tone I saw you for a moment by
lightningflash near the gibbet You are my man o the woods and
sir I owe you muchvery muchindeed sir if

I am no sir quoth I shortly

Gregory says she looking down on the fellow neath my foot
Gregory get up

Gregory says I stir not

Sir would you hurt my servant says she knitting her slender black
brows

I faith I nodded The uncivil rogue forced me to burst open the
gate

And why are you here Who are you What is your name cried she a
little breathlessly and I wondered at the fixed intensity of her gaze

Gregory says I taking my foot from his middle but threatening him
with my staff I am come for no traffic with maids so rise up and
bring me to your master

Nay groans the fellow turning up his eyes tis thing impossible
heres only my lady

And I seek your masteris he within

Nay says Gregory flinching beneath my staff as my lady shall tell
eehe is not here

Ha quoth I That will I see for myself But as I turned to
stride up the avenue my lady wheeled her horse barring my way

Whither go you she demanded her eyes holding mine

To the house for Sir Richard I have been at some small pains to gain
speech with him

To what end

Why truly I answered leaning upon my staff and viewing her eye to
eye tis a matter of vital moment ayein a manner of speakingtis
a matter of life and death betwixt us Now as I stood thus I could
not but be conscious of her glowing vigorous beauty her bodys noble
shape and the easy grace of her as she sat her fretting horse swaying
to his every movement And to me in my rags she seemed no woman but
a goddess rather proud immaculate and very far removed and yet these
proud lips could mayhap grow soft and tender these clear eyes that
met mine so fearlessly

The staff was wrenched from my loosened grasp and Gregory leaping to
his feet fetched me therewith staggering blow on blow shouting with
his every stroke

HoPeter Roger Will Hohither lads all Loose the
dogshither to me a Gods name But though mused with blows I
rushed in blindly and closing with the fellow got him fairly by the
throat and shook him to and fro And now was I minded to choke him
outright but even then spied a cavalier who spurred his horse
against me Hereupon I dashed the breathless Gregory aside and turned
to meet my new assailant a spruce young gallant he from curling
lovelock to Spanish boots I remember cursing savagely as his whip
caught me then or ever he could reach me again I sprang in beneath
the head of his rearing horse and seizing the rein close by the bridle
began to drag and wrench at the bit I heard shouts and a womans cry
of fear but I strove only the fiercer while up and up reared the
great roan horse snorting in terror his forelegs lashing wildly
above tossing mane the eyes of his rider glared down at me as laughing
exultant I wrenched savagely at the bridle until whinnying with pain
and terror the great beast losing his balance crashed over backwards
into the dust Leaping clear of those desperate wildthrashing
hooves I found myself beset by divers fellows armed with staves who
closed upon me shouting and above these her eyes wide her full red
lips closeset my lady looked down on me and I meeting that look
laughed even as her fellows rushed at me

Go cosset your pretty springald wench But even then dazed and
halfblinded by a hail of blows I staggered sank to my knees
struggled up again smiting with bare fists A flame seemed to flash
before my eyes a taste of blood was on my tongue and all sounds grew
faint and far away as stumbling blindly I threw up my arms tripped
and plunged down and down into an engulfing darkness and knew no more



CHAPTER VI

OF MY SHAMEFUL SUFFERINGS AND HOW I WAS DELIVERED THEREFROM

I awoke with a sound in my ears like the neverceasing surge and hiss
of waters a sound that waxed ever louder Hearkening to this I
presently sought to move and wondered vaguely uneasy to find this
impossible I strove now to lift my right hand found it fast held
tried my left and found it in like case and so became conscious of
something that gripped me about the throat and ever my wonder and
unease grew And now opening my eyes the first thing they lighted on
was a small pool of blood and beyond this a battered turnip and beyond
this the carcass of a dead cat and beyond this again a pair of trim
buckled shoes cotton stockings wide breeches and a broad belt where
swung a tuck or rapier prodigiously long of blade in a while my eyes
ranging higher yet I beheld a thin face scarred from mouth to eyebrow
a brown face with bright very quick eyes and strange ears they being
cut to points like a dogs ears Now looking at this face it seemed
to me in hazy fashion that somewhere and at some time I had seen such a
face before All this while the noise I have likened to the sea had
been growing louder so that I began to recognise voices and even
words and lifting my head as well as I might by reason of the thing
that gripped my throat I saw faces all about methey hemmed me in on
every side and stretched away to the churchyard wall

Then all at once the knowledge of my situation rushed upon me I was
in the pillory

Huroor E be acoming round cried a voice

Time too shouted a great strapping fellow near by Tis sinful
shame to waste good badeggs on rogue as knoweth not when e do be hit
He be a mark as babe couldnt missa proper big un So saying the
fellow let fly an egg at me the which striking the board within an
inch of my face filled the air with suffocating stench

This was a signal for me to become a target for all the garbage of the
village And now indeed good cause had I to be thankful for my thick
mane of hair which in some sort saved me from sundry cuts and
bruises howbeit my face was soon clotted with blood and filth

Vain were it to tell all the frenzy of rage that possessed me as I
stood thus helpless against my howling tormentors chief of whom was
the great fellow I have mentioned who by reason of height and length
of arm struck me oftenest once indeed when beside myself with fury
I raised my head to curse him he took me a blow in the mouth with some
vile missile that set my very gums ableeding

Lord love ye shipmatethats the spirit said a voice below me
But keep the wind o themdont let em rake yedouse your
figurehead Lie low shipmate lie low and trust to your comrade Adam
Penfeatherand thats me Patience is the word

Looking whence the voice came I beheld the man with whom I had talked
that morning now as our glances met one of his bright eyes closed
slowly and nodding twice he turned and elbowed his way through the
crowd Small liking had I for this fellow but with his departure a
sense of loneliness gripped me and needs must I lift my head to stare
after him whereupon a rotten egg struck me above the eye causing a
most intolerable smart at this moment too the great fellow swung a
cats carcass by the tail but or ever he could hurl this stinking
missile a hand clouted him heavily over the ear from behind tumbling
his hat off whereupon he turned bellowing with rage and smote his
nearest neighbour with the foul thing meant for me In an instant all
was uproar around these two as the crowd forgetting me surged about
them Thus for some while during which the fight raged I was left
unmolested and looked hither and thither amid the swaying throng for
this fellow Adam Penfeather but he was vanished quite

At length the big fellow having sufficiently trounced his opponent
the crowd betook itself and very joyously to my further baiting and
torment Now as I hung thus in my shame and misery faint with my
hurts and parched with cruel thirst my gaze lighted upon a small bony
mana merryeyed fellow with wide upcurving mouth who laughed and
jested continually it was as he stooped for some missile or other that
his eye met mine and in that bright eye methought I read a sudden pity

O cull says I hoarsely a mouthful o water

Pal says he winking alls bowmon Whereupon he turned and
vanished in the crowd and I burning in a fever of thirst panted for
his return straining my eyes for sight of him then as he came not I
groaned and drooped my head and lo even then he was before me bearing
a tin pannikin full of water This in hand he mounted the steps of
the pillory and despite the jeers and hootings of the crowd was
lifting the lifegiving water to my eager lips when forth leapt the big
fellow and sent water and pannikin flying with a savage blow of his
fist

None o that peddler he roared And now as I groaned and licked
at bleeding lips with swollen tongue the little man turned quick as a
flash tripped up the great fellows heels and staying for no more
made off through the crowd that gave him passage howling its acclaim

The afternoon dragged wearily on and what with the suffocating stench
of the filth that plastered me what with heat and dust and agonising
thirst my suffering grew almost beyond endurance a deadly nausea
seized me and I came nigh to swooning But now in this my great
extremity of a sudden from somewhere on the outskirts of the crowd
rose a shrill cry of Fire the which cry being taken up by others
filled the air with panic the crowd melted as if by magic until the
village green and the road were quite deserted All this I noted but
dimly being more dead than alive when I became conscious of one that
spake in my ear

Stand by shipmate stand by Theres never a rogue leftall run to
the firestand by to slip your moorings

Let be I groaned Im a dead man

Then heres that shall make ye quick says this fellow Penfeather
dangling a great key before my swimming eyes Heres freedom from your
devils trap and a plaguy time Ive had to come by it

Then for the love o Godlet me out I groaned

Easy all shipmate says he turning the key upon his finger For
lookee now heres me a timid man run no small risk this last
halfhour and all for you Now a bargains a bargain youll agree

Well says I faintly

Why then shipmate if I free ye of your bonds wilt be my comrade
sworn Aye or no

No says I Plague take ye that bargain with dying man No

Why then sighs he heres a good rick ablaze heres John Purdy the
beadle wi his head broke and heres me in a sweat alackand all to
no purpose since needs must you in your bilboes bide

Do but get me a draft of water I pleaded

Nary a drop says he spinning the key on his finger under my nose
Nor yet a foaming stoup o good Kentish alenut brown

Ha roguerogue I panted twixt parched lips Ill yetavenge
this tormentan I live

The legs of a man says he are a vain thing and his strength
likewise and as to vengeance shipmate wellhow goeth your vengeance
as be more to ye than fortune or riches Here he paused but I held
my peace and he continued Heres you now you that was so mighty and
fierceaye a very hellfire roarerheres that same you ahanging
here a very helpless pitiful fool shipmate and thirsty twould
seem

Here I groaned again

And one not over sweet says he stopping his nose

Hereupon I cursed him though faintly and he comes a step nearer

Tis said my Lady Brandon and her gallant Sir Rupert Deringhim you
overthrew shipmatedo mean to come and take a look at you anon
though tis shame you should be made a raree showburn me

Hereupon I fell into a sudden raging fury striving so desperately
against my bonds that the devilish engine wherein I stood shook and
rattled again but I strove to no purpose and so presently hung there
spent and bruised and breathless whiles Penfeather spun the key on his
finger and sighed

Shipmate says he wherefore irk yourself wi bonds Say but the
word and Ill deliver ye bring ye to safe harbourage and cherish ye
with much good ale Be persuaded now

Why then groans I give me but until tomorrow to do what I
willand Im yours

Done says he and forthwith set key to padlock but scarce had he
freed the headboard than he falls acursing neath his breath Easy
comrade easy quoth he softly Bide still awhilehither cometh
yon beefy fool back againso will I make show of miscalling ye till he
be gone The which he did forthwith giving me scurvy rogue and the
like Now lifting my head whom should I behold but that same tall
fellow had been my chief tormenter and who now hasted over the green
towards us

It be nowt but Farmer Darrells rick ablaze says he to Penfeather
so let un burn says I Farmer Darrell be no friend o mine So I be
come to sport wi yon big rogue awhile Herewith he stooped for some
missile to cast at me but now I straightened my back the headboard
gave and ere the fellow was aware I was creeping swiftly upon him
Taken thus by surprise small chance had he for leaping on him I bore
him over on his back and kneeling on him buried my fingers in his
throat And so I choked him right joyfully till Penfeather gripped
my arm

Lord love me cries he Will ye kill the fool

That will I

And hang for him

Nayhes scarce worth it

Then devil burn yeloose his windpipe So I loosed the fellows
throat and despite his feeble kicks began to drag him over the grass

What now comrade says Penfeather Sink me what now

Watch and see So I brought the fellow to the pillory wherein I set
him and plucking the key from Penfeather locked him there in my
stead which done I kicked him once or twice and having found the
cats carcass made shift to hang the stinking thing about his neck
then tossing the key into the pond I took to my heels and left the
fellow groaning mighty dismal



CHAPTER VII

HOW I HEARD TELL OF BLACK BARTLEMYS TREASURE

Now scarce was I clear of the village than I was again seized of a
deadly sickness and vertigo so that I stumbled and was like to fall
but that Penfeather propped me with his shoulder In this fashion I
made shift to drag myself along nor would he suffer me stay or respite
maugre my weakness until following the brook he had brought me into
the green solitude of the woods

Here then I sank down sucking up the cool sweet water twixt parched
lips drinking until Penfeather stayed me lest I should do myself hurt
thereby Thereafter from strength reviving I bathed my divers wounds
the which though painful were of small account and fell to
cleansing my spattered garments as well as I might

So were to be comrades after all says Penfeather watching me
where he sat hard by

Ayetomorrow

And how goeth vengeance shipmate At this I turned on him with
clenched fist Nay easy does it says he never budging for if
twas the folly of vengeance brought ye in the peccadille twas your
comrade Adam Penfeather got ye out againso easy all

Twas you fired the rick then

None other

Tis a hanging matter Ive heard

Why a man must needs run some small risk for his comrade dye see

Then Adam Penfeather Im your debtor

Nay says he there be no debts twixt comrades o the Brotherhood
tis give and take share and share And speaking he drew forth a
purse and emptying store of money on the grass betwixt us divided it
equally and pushed a pile of silver and copper towards me

And whats this I demanded

Share and share comrade

But Im no comrade o yours till after tonight

Aha says he pinching his long chin Ist more vengeance then

Keep your money till it be earned I muttered

Sink meand theres pride for ye says he Pride which is a vain
thing and vengeance which is a vainer Lord love me shipmate tis
plain to see youre o the quality spite your ragsblue blood
highbreeding noblesse oblige and all the rest ont

Stint your gab says I scowling

Tis writ large all over ye he went on placidly enough As for me
Im but a plain man wi no time for vengeance and no whit o pride
about me anywhere What I says to you is get to windard o
vengeancenay heave it overboard shipmate and youll ride the
easier aye and sweeter and seek something more usefulgold for
instance tis a handy thing Ive heard sayso ha done wi
vengeance

No says I frowning Notnay not for all Bartlemys treasure

Aha quoth he softly So youve heard tell of it then along the
Spanish Main

I heard tell of it last night in a cave from a sailorman

How says he starting and with keen eyes glancing hither and thither
A sailormanhereabouts

Damme says I the country seems thick o sailormen

Ha Dye say so And what like was this one

A comely rogue that sang strange song

Ah said Penfeather his eyes narrowing A song says youand
strangehow strange

Twas all of dead men and murder

Dye mind any line ot shipmate

Aye the words of it went somewhat like this

 Some on a knife did part wi life
 And some a bullet took O
 But

Now here as I stopped at a loss my companion took up the rhyme almost
unconsciously and below his breath

 But three times three died plaguily
 A wriggling on a hook O

Comrade says he in the same low voice Did ye see ever among these
mariners a onehanded man a tall man wi a hook in place of his left
handa very bright sharp hook And now as Penfeather questioned me
he seized my wrist and I was amazed at the iron grip of him

No I answered

Nay says he loosing his hold how should youhes dead along o
so many on em Hes done forhim and his hook devil burn him

 A hook both long and stout and strong
 They died by gash o hook O

Ah I cried So that was the kind of hook

Aye nodded Penfeather That was the kind A bullets bad a
knifes worse but a steel hook shipmate very sharp dye see is a
death no man should die Shipmate Ive seen divers men dead by that
same hooktorn and ripped dye seelike a dogs fangs Id seen many
die ere then but that waytwas an ill sight for queasy stomachs

And hethis man with the hook is dead you say

And burning in hellfire

Are you sure

I killed him shipmate

You says I

I shipmate We fought on a shelf o rock high above the sea my
knife agin his knife and hooktwas that same hook gave me this scar
athwart my jawbut as he struck I struck and saw him go spinning over
and over down and down and splash into the sea And for three days I
watched that bit o shore living on shellfish and watching for him
to make sure I had finished him at last

And these other rogues says I

What like were they shipmate Hereupon I described as fully as I
might the three sailormen I had fought with in the hedgetavern
albeit I made no mention of the maid while Penfeather listened
nodding now and then and pinching at his long chin And this other
fellow says he when I had done this fellow that sangdye know if
his name chanced to be MingsAbnegation Mings comrade

The very same says I

Strange quoth Penfeather and thereafter sat staring gloomily down
into the rippling waters of the brook for a while I wonder says he
at last I wonder

What think ye shall bring these fellows so far from the coastwhat
should they be after

Me shipmate

You says I for the second time marvelling at the strange quiet of
him And what would they have of you

My life shipmate and one other thing What that thing is I will
tell you when we have drunk the bloodbrotherhood But now it behoveth
me to be agoing so Ill away But when you shall seek me as seek me
ye will shipmate shalt hear of me at the PeckoMalt tavern which
is a small quiet place twixt here and Bedgebury Cross Come there at
any hour day or night and say The Faithful Friend and you shall
find safe harbourage Remember comrade the word is The Faithful
Friend and if so be you can choose your timenight is better So
saying he arose

Wait says I pointing to the coins yet lying on the grass Take
your money

Tis none o mine says he shaking his head Keep it or throw it
awaytis all one to me Then he went away through the wood and as
he went I thought he walked with a new and added caution



CHAPTER VIII

HOW I FELL IN WITH ONE GODBEHERE A PEDDLER

Evening was at hand as I reached a little alehouse well away from the
road and pleasantly secluded by trees thither came I fondling
Penfeathers money in my pocket for I was again mightily sharp set
But all at once I stopped for passing the open lattice I heard loud
laughter and a merry voice

And there believe me gossips quoth this voice as sure as this
be beefaye and good beef and cooked to a turn mistresstheres
this great loblolly hectoring Tom Button fast i the pilloryand by
this good ale a woeful sight his eyes blacked his nose ableeding
his jerkin torn and a dead cat about his neck ohoaha Tom
Buttonbig Tom fighting Tom so loud o tongue and ready o fistTom
as have cowed so manythere is he fast by the neck and agroaning see
ye gossips loud enough for six wish I may die else And the best o
the joke isthe key be gone as Im a sinner So they needs must
break the lock to get him out Big Tom as have thrashed every man for
miles But here merry voice and laughter ceased and a buxom woman
thrust smiling face from the window and face like her voice was
kindly when she addressed me

What would ye young master

A little food mistress says I touching my weatherworn hat and
pulling it lower over my bruised and swollen features

Why come in master come inthere be none here but my Roger and
Godby the peddler as knoweth everyone

So I entered forthwith a small snug chamber and seating myself in the
darkest corner acknowledged the salutations of the two men while the
goodlooking woman bustling to and fro soon set before me a fine
joint of roast beef with bread and ale upon which I incontinent fell
to

The two men sat cheek by jowl at the farther end of the table one a
redfaced lusty fellow the other a small bony man who laughed and
ate and ate and laughed and yet contrived to talk all the while that
it was a wonder to behold

Was you over to Lamberhurst way master says he to me all at once

Aye I nodded busy with the beef

Why then happen ye saw summat o the sport they had wi the big gipsy
i the pilloryhim as saulted my Lady Brandon and nigh did for her
ladyships coz

Aye says I again bending over my platter

Tis ill sport to bait a poor soul as be helpless I thinknay I
know for Ive stood there myself ere now though I wont say as I
didnt clod this fellow once or twice today myselfI were a rare
clodder in my time aha Did you clod this big rogue master

No

And wherefore not

Because says I cutting myself more beef I happened to be that
same rogue Here Roger the landlord stared his buxom wife shrank
away and even the talkative peddler grew silent awhile viewing me
with his shrewd merry eyes

Aha says he at last Twas you was it

It was

And why must ye sault a noble lady

I never did

Gregory swears to it

Gregorys a liar

Which is true enoughso he be nodded the landlord

And a cruelhard man added his wife But Lord young master they

Which it be nodded Roger Likewise cut Which be ill for ee
thoughlike Godby hereI wont say but what I moughtnt ha took a
heave at ye had I been there it being natrallike to heave things at
such times dye see

Very natural says I

And then why questioned the little peddler why break open the
wicketgate

To get in

Aha quoth Godby the peddler winking roguish eye On the prigging
lay perchance cull or peradventure the millken Speak plain pal
alls bowmon

Im no flash cull says I neither buzz file millken nor
scamperer

Mum pal mum Im no more flash than you be though Ive no love for
the harmonbecks as Roger here will tell ee A peddler be I and well

specially by wenches and childeraha manys the yard o riband and
lace the garters pins ballads gingerbread men pigs and elephants
very fair gilt as theyve had o kind Godby and all for love And
yet plague and perish itheres me warned off my pitch heres me wi
the damned catchpolls on my heels and all along o this same Gregory
Braggrot him

As to all that I know not says I but this Ill swear to you are
a man Godby the peddler and one with a bold and kindly heart inside
you

How so he questioned his bright eyes all of a twinkle How so my
bully boy

That pannikin of water

Which you didnt get my cocksbody lad

Which you were man enough to bring me

Which Tom Button did ye out of

Which you knocked him down for

Which is Gospeltrue Roger and Cicely twas a neat throw Tom
bumped heavyaye uncommon flat were Tom let me eat worms else

For all of the which says I cutting more beef I ask you now to
drink a stoup of ale with me

Wi all my heart cries the peddler

Then says I laying my money on the table let us all drink in
fellowship for ale like fellowship is a goodly thing and good things
be rare in this world

And thats true o conscience smiled the buxom Cicely

And yell find no better brew than our own quoth Roger

And that Ill swear to laughed the peddler Cram me wi spiders
else

So the good ale was brought and Godby lifting his tankard smiled and
nodded over the creamy foam

Heres a griping colic to every catchpoll harmonbeck and the like
vermin twixt this and London town says he and lifted the ale to his
lips but suddenly he sat it down untasted and rose Friends Im
took quoth he See yonder As he spake the narrow doorway was
darkened and two rough fellows entered and each bore a formidable
bludgeon

Aye says one a big surlyvoiced fellow here be us peddler and
there be you so best come easyan no tricks mind

Then easy does it lads says Godby no whit abashed No lamb could
come milder than Godby aye lambs doves and babes is roaring lions
compared wi Godbyso easy does it What ist this time codgers

Fower hours i the pillory three i the stocks and a month in
Maidstone jail and thats what

And enough too growled Roger the landlord clenching hairy fist and
glancing furtively towards a rusty sword suspended above the hearth

Let be RogerIm a lamb sighed the peddler And I wouldnt ha
you in trouble by mebesides this room o yourn though snug aint
fit for struggling nor striving So friendsgoodbye Then he
turned away between his two captors but as he did so his bright eyes
for one moment met mine and in his look I read appeal

Now scarce were they gone when I got me to my feet whereat the
landlord Roger did the like

Whats to do he questioned glancing yearningly from me to the rusty
sword

Why now says I counting out my reckoning bide you herefor your
good wifes sake

Aye do now Roger she pleaded Twould be ruination to us

Moreover says I reaching for my cudgel they are but two so bide
you here Then I stepped forth of the tavern and very soon came up
with the two fellows their prisoner walking betwixt them meekly
enough But as I approached they halted all three

And what be you after demanded the surly fellow

You

And what dye want of ushey

Your prisoner

Ha And what for him

Ive a mind to him

O Ye have eh

I have Do I get him

Be curst for a black ugly rogue

Thats no answer

Tis all youll get o we save ard knocks says the man spitting
in his hand and taking firm grip of his bludgeon

Why then I must take him says I

Try and be damned roared the fellow Halook alive Jem And
whirling up his staff he made at me amain but I sprang aside and as
his rush carried him past my answering stroke caught him fairly twixt
wrist and elbow and his cudgel spun harmlessly into the hedge
breathing curses he sought to close with me but I keeping my
distance smote him very blithely how and where I would until he his
arm useless misliking my bludgeonplay and reading no mercy in my
look very wisely betook him to his heels Hereupon I turned to find
the little peddler sitting astride his mans neck and his fist against
the fellows nose

Smell it Job he was saying Smell it lad tis the fist of a man
as would be agroping for your liver if it werent for the respect I do
bear your old motherskin me else So thank your old mother lad
first as youve got a liver and second for asaving o that same liver
And now get up Jobbegone Job arter your pal and tell folk as
kind Godby though sore tempted never so much as set finger on your
liver and all along o your good old motheraway wi ye So the
fellow got him to his legs mighty rueful and sped away after his
comrade

Pal says the little peddler reaching out and grasping my hand
heres full quittance for that pannikin o water as you never got
And nowwhats the word

Now says I let us go back and drink the good ale

Pal quoth the peddler with a flash of white teeth wi all my
heart

Thus we presently returned to the little tavern and found there Roger
the landlord the rusty sword in one brawny fist his wife holding fast
to the other At sight of us he dropped the weapon and roared
joyously and Cicely running to us clasped our hands in hearty
welcome So we sat down all four and while we quaffed the ale Godby
described our late encounter with great exactness

Pal says he thereafter reaching across the table to grip my hand
again what might your name be

Martin

Why then Martin have ye any friends or kin

None

No more have I and look now this Kent country is no fit place for
you or me arter today So what I says is lets you and me pad it
palthe road ladthe good highroad aha How say ye Martin

Why no pal

Because after tonight if I chance to be neither dead nor in prison

Why life is an ill thing says I

Nay lookee Martin life may be worth whiles now and thenaye lad
there be times good times

Lusty ale quoth Roger setting three newfilled pipkins before us
And none better nor ourneh wife

That I do swear to Roger laughed the peddler Choke me else But
now as to the sea Martin paltis a dogs life

You know the sea then

Like my hand Martin and all along o my fathers godliness A fine
big man he was and devout as he was lusty Having begot me his next
duty was to name me and O pal name me he did A name as no raskell
lad might live up to a name as brought me into such troublous faction
ashore that he packed me off to sea And if you ax me what name twas
Ill answer ye bold and trueGodbehere Jenkins at your service
though Godby for short and twixt friends

Now the more I saw of this little peddler the better I liked him so
that the hour was late when having supped excellently well I rose to
take my leave

If you must be away young master said the buxom Cicely dont ee
forget there be ever a welcome for ee at the Hoppoleeh Roger

There is so nodded the landlord Likewise a pipkin of ale and a
bite and all gratus to a pal

And look ee Martin my cove quoth the peddler grasping my hand
there be ever and always the good highroad leading on and away to
better things so happen ye should change your mind seek me here
twixt this and dawn if tomorrow ye shall hear o Godby at the Fox at
Spelmonden So luck go wi ye my bien cull

And you says I should you be minded to sail with me go to the
PeckoMalt at Bedgbury Crossthe word is The Faithful Friend and
ask for Adam Penfeather

So I presently stepped forth of the little tavern where I had found
such kindliness and turning from the narrow lane struck off across
the fields

It was a sweet warm night the moon not up as yet thus as I went I
lifted my gaze to the heavens where stars made a glory And beholding
these wondrous fires I needs must recall the little peddlers saying
and ponder his good timeshis times of stars and birds of noon and
eventide of welcomes sweet and eyes of love

And now I was of a sudden filled with a great yearning and passionate
desire that I too might know such times But as I climbed a stile my
hand by chance came upon the knife at my girdle and sitting on the
stile I drew it forth and fell to handling its broad blade and doing
so knew in my heart that such times were not for me nor ever could
be And sitting there knife in hand desire and yearning were lost
and whelmed in fierce and black despair



CHAPTER IX

HOW I HAD WORD WITH THE LADY JOAN BRANDON FOR THE THIRD TIME

The moon was well up when striking out from the gloom of the woods I
reached a wall very high and strong whereon moss and lichens grew
skirting this I presently espied that I soughta place where the
coping was gone with sundry of the bricks making here a gap very apt
to escalade and here years agone I had been wont to climb this wall
to the furtherance of some boyish prank on many a night such as this
Awhile stood I staring up at this gap then seizing hold of massy
brickwork I drew myself up and dropped into a walled garden Here
were beds of herbs well tended and orderly and as I went I breathed
an air sweet with the smell of thyme and lavender and a thousand other
scents an air fraught with memories of sunny days and joyous youth
insomuch that I clenched my hands and hasted from the place Past
sombre trees mighty of girth and branch I hurried past still pools
full of a moony radiance where lilies floated past marble fauns and
dryads that peeped ghostlike from leafy solitudes past sundial and
carven bench by clipped yewhedges and winding walks until screened
in shadow I paused to look upon a great and goodly house and as I
stood there viewing it over from terracewalk to gabled roof I heard a
distant clock chime ten

The great house lay very silent and dark not a light showed save in
one lower chamber So I waited patiently my gaze on this light
while ever and anon the leaves about me stirred in the soft
nightwind with a sound like one that sighed mournfully

Thus stayed I some while howbeit the light yet aglow and my patience
waning I stole forward keeping ever in the shadows and ascending
the terrace came where grew ivy very thick and gnarled overspreading
this wing of the house Groping amid the leaves I found that I
soughta stout staple deepdriven between the bricks with above this
another and yet other again the which formed a sort of ladder whereby
as a boy I had been wont to come and go by night or day as I listed

Forthwith I began to climb by means of these staples and the ivy until
at last my fingers grasped the stone sill of a window and now the
lattice being open I contrived albeit it with much ado to clamber
into the room It was a fairsized chamber and the moonlight falling
athwart the floor lit upon a great carven bed brave with tapestried
hangings Just now the silken curtains were updrawn and upon the bed
I saw a bundle of garments all ribands laces and the like the which
of themselves gave me sudden pause From these my gaze wandered to
where against the panelling hung a goodly rapier complete with girdle
and slings its silver hilt its guards and curling quillons bright in
the moonbeams So came I and reaching it down drew it from the
scabbard and saw the blade very bright as it had been well cared for
And graven on the forte of the blade was the Conisby blazon and the
legend

 ROUSE ME NOT

Now as I stood watching the moonbeams play up and down the long blade
I heard the light quick tread of feet ascending the stairs without and
a voice very rich and sweetly melodious that brake out asinging and
the words it sang these

 A poor soul sat sighing by a green willow tree
 With hand on his bosom his head on his knee
 Sighing Willow willow willow
 O willow willow willow
 And O the green willow my garland shall be

Nearer came the singing while I stood sword in hand waiting the song
ended suddenly and the sweet voice called

O Marjorie wake me betimes I must be abroad with the sun
tomorrowgoodnight sweet wench

I crouched in the curtains of the great bed as the latch clicked and
the room filled with the soft glow of a candle a moments silence
then

O Marjorie Ill wear the green taffety in the morning Nay indeed
Ill be my own tirewoman tonight

The light was borne across the room then coming softly to the door I
closed it and setting my back against it leaned there At the small
sound I made she turned and beholding me shrank back and I saw the
candlestick shaking in her hand ere she set it down upon the carved
press beside her

Who is itwho is it she questioned breathlessly staring at my
bruised and swollen features

A rogue you had dragged lifeless to the pillory

You she breathed You And they set you in the pillory Twas by
no order of me

Tis no matter lady here was just reward for a rogue says I But
now I seek Sir Richard

Nay indeedindeed you shall not find him here

That will I prove for myself says I and laid hand on latch

Sir says she in the same breathless fashion why will you not
believe me Seek him an you will but I tell you Sir Richard sailed
into the Spanish Main two years since and was lost

Lost says I feeling a tremor of apprehension shake me as I met her
truthful eyes Lost say youhow lost

He and his ship were taken by the Spaniards off Hispaniola

Taken I repeated like one sore mazed TakenoffHispaniola
And here bethinking me of the cruel mockery of it all should this
indeed be so black anger seized me You lie to me I cried Ha
by God you lie An there be aught of justice in heaven then Richard
Brandon must be here

Who are you she questioned viewing me with the same wideeyed
stare Who are youso fierce so young yet with whitened hair and
that trembles at the truth Who are youspeak

You have lied to save him from me I cried You lieha confess
And I strode towards her the long blade aglitter in my quivering
grasp

Would you kill me says she all unflinching and with eyes that never
wavered Would you murder a helpless maidMartin Conisby The
rapier fell to the rug at my feet and lay there my breath caught and
thus we stood awhile staring into each others eyes

Martin Conisby is dead says I at last

For answer she pointed to the wall above my head and looking thither
I saw the picture of a young cavalier richly habited who smiled down
greyeyed and gentlelipped all carefree youth and gaiety and
beneath this portrait ran the words

 MARTIN CONISBY LORD WENDOVER Aetat 21

Madam quoth I at last turning my back on the picture Yon innocent
was whipped to death aboard a Spanish galleass years since wherefore
I a poor rogue come seeking his destroyer

Sir says she clasping her hands and viewing me with troubled eyes
O sirwhom mean you

One who having slain the father sold the son into slavery to the
hell of Spanish dungeon and rowingbench to stripes and shame and
torment one the just God hath promised to my vengeanceI mean Richard
Brandon

Ahmercy of Godmy father Ah no noit cannot be My father
Sure here is some black mistake

Being his daughter you should know tis very truth Being a Brandon
you must know of the feud hath cursed and rent our families time out of
mind the bitter faction and bloodshed

Aye she murmured This I do know

Well madam five years agone or thereabouts my father falsely
attainted of treason died in his prison and I drugged and trepanned
aboard ship was sold into the plantations whence few returnand
Richard Brandon enriched by our loss and great at court dreamed he
had made an end o the Conisbys and that the feud was ended once and
for all

My lord says she proud head upflung I deny all this Such
suspicion so base and unfounded shameth but yourself You have dared
force your way into my house at dead of night and nowO now you would
traduce my absent father charging him with shameful crimesand this
to me his daughter Enough Ill hear no more begone ere I summon my
servants and have you driven forth and seizing the bellrope that
hung against the panelling she faced me her deep bosom heaving
tempestuous white hands clenched and scorning me with her eyes

Ring says I and seated myself in a chair beside her great bed

Have you no shame

None madam twas all whipped out o me aboard the Esmeralda
galleass Ring madam But I go not till I learn once and for all
if Sir Richard be here or no

Now at this she loosed the bellrope very suddenly and covering her
face with her hands stood thus awhile

God pity me says she at last in weeping voice I may not forget
how you saved me from Here a tremor seemed to shake her then she
spake again yet now scarce above a whisper Your face hath looked
upon me night and morn these two years and nowO Martin Conisby were
you but the man I dreamed you

Im a rogue newbroke from slavery says I

Aye she cried suddenly lifting her head and viewing me with new and
bitter scorn and one that speaketh lies of an absent man

Lies quoth I choking on the word Lies madam Why then how
cometh my picture heremy coat of arms above the mantel yonder the
Conisby scutcheon on your gates What do you at Conisby Shene

Now in her look I saw a sudden doubt a growing dread her breath
caught and she shrank back to the panelled wall and leaned there and
ever the trouble in her eyes grew Well my lady I questioned
Have ye no answer

Twas said  I have heard  the Conisbys were no more

Even so how came Sir Richard by this our house

Naynay II know little of my fathers businesshe was ever a
silent man and Ihave passed my days in London or abroad But
youah tell mewhy seek you my father

That is betwixt him and me

Was itmurder Was it vengeance my lord Here as I made no
answer she crosses over to me and lays one slender hand on my
shoulder whereat I would have risen but her touch stayed me Speak
says she in a whisper Was it his life you sought Meeting the look
in her deep soft eyes I was silent for a while finding no word then
dumbly I nodded And now I felt her hand trembling on my shoulder ere
it was withdrawn and looking up I saw she had clasped her hands and
stood with head bowed like one in prayer O Martin Conisby she
whispered now thank God that in His mercy He hath stayed thee from
murder So she stood awhile then crossing to the carven press took
thence divers papers and set them before me Read she commanded

So I examined these papers and found therein indisputable evidence that
my journey here was vain indeed that Sir Richard sailing westward
had been taken by Spaniards off Hispaniola and carried away prisoner
none knew whither

And in a while having read these papers I laid them by and rising
stumbled towards the open casement

Well my lord says she in strange breathless fashion And what
now

Why now says I wearily it seems my vengeance is yet to seek

Vengeance she cried Ah God pity thee Doth life hold for thee
nought better

Nought

Vengeance is a consuming fire

So seek I vengeance

O Martin Conisby bethink you Vengeance is but a sickness of the
minda wasting disease

So seek I vengeance

For him that questeth after vengeance this fair world can hold nought
beside

So give me vengeance nought else seek I of this world

Ah poor soulpoor man that might be so do I pity thee

I seek no mans pity

But I am a woman so shall I pity thee alway

Now as I prepared to climb through the lattice she beholding the sword
where it yet lay stooped and taking it up sheathed it This was
thine own once Ive heard says she Take it Martin Conisby keep
it clean free from dishonour and leave thy vengeance to God

Not so says I shaking my head I have my knife tis weapon
better suited to my rags So saying I clambered out through the
lattice even as I had come Being upon the terrace I glanced up to
find her leaning to watch me and with the moon bright on her face

Live you for nought but vengeance she questioned softly

So aid me God says I

So shall I pity thee alway Martin Conisby she repeated and sighed
and so was gone

Then I turned slow of foot and went my solitary way



CHAPTER X

HOW I SWORE TO THE BLOODBROTHERHOOD

I remember the moon was very bright as reaching the end of a grassy
lane or rather carttrack I saw before me a small snugseeming
tavern with a board over the door whereon were the words

 YE PECK OF MALT

 BY

 JOEL BYM

And looking the place over from trim white steps before the door to
trim thatched roof I marvelled at its air of prosperity for here it
stood so far removed from road and byeroad so apparently away from
all habitation and so lost and hid by trees it standing within a
little copse that it was great wonder any customer should ever find
his way hither

The place was very quiet not a light showed anywhere and the door was
fast shut which was nothing strange for the hour was late Stepping
up to the door I knocked loudly thereon with my cudgel at first
without effect but having repeated the summons a voice from within
hailed me gruffly

Who knocks

The Faithful Friend says I At this the door swung suddenly open
and a lanthorn was thrust into my face whereupon I fell back a step
dazzled then gradually beyond this glare I made out a dark shape
blocking the doorway a great fellow so prodigiously hairy of head and
face that little was there to see of features save two round eyes and
a great hooked nose

And who dye seek Faithful Friend says he

Master Adam Penfeather

Why then Faithful Friend heave ahead says he and making way for
me to enter closed the door the which I noticed was mighty stout and
strong and having locked and bolted it barred it with a stout iron
set into massy sockets in either wall

You go mighty secure says I

Cock quoth the giant eyeing me over slowly Cock be ye a
cacklerbecause if so be you do cackle overly heres we as wont love
ye no whit my cock

Good says I returning his look I seek no mans love

Cock quoth he plunging huge fist into his beard and giving it a
tug I begin to love ye better nor I thought This way cock
Herewith he led me along a wide flagged passage and up a broad stair
with massy carven handrail and as I went I saw the place was much
bigger than I had deemed it the walls too were panelled and I
judged it had once formed part of a noble house At last we reached a
door whereon the fellow knocked softly and so presently ushered me
into a fair chamber lit by wax candles and here seated at a table
with papers before him and a pen in his fingers sat Master Adam
Penfeather

Ha shipmate says he motioning to a chair you be something
earlier than I expected Suffer me to make an end o this
businesssit ye comrade sit As for you Bosun have up a flask o
the Spanish winethe black seal

Aye capn says he and seizing a fistful of hair above his eyebrow
strode away closing the door behind him

Now beholding Penfeather as he bent to his writingthe lean aquiline
face of him so smooth and youthful in contrast to his silver hairI
was struck by his changed look indeed he seemed some bookish student
rather than the lawless rover I had thought him despite the pistols at
his elbow and the long rapier that dangled at his chairback moreover
there was about him also an air of latent power I had not noticed ere
this

At length having made an end of his writing he got up and stretched
himself

So shipmate art ready to swear the bloodfellowship wi me

Aye says I When do we sail At this he glanced at me swiftly
from the corners of his eyes

So ho he murmured pinching his chin The winds changed it seems
you grow eagerand wherefore

Tis no matter

Shipmate says he shaking his head an we sail as brothers and
comrades there must be never a secret betwixt usspeak

As ye will quoth I leaning back in my chair I learn then you are
sailing as master in a ship bound for the Main in quest of Sir Richard
Brandon lost off Hispaniola two years agone Sir Richard Brandon is
the man I have sought ever since I broke out of the hell he sold me
into Now lookee Adam Penfeather says I springing to my feet and
grasping his arm lookee nowput me in the way of meeting this man
aid me to get my hand on this man and I am yoursaye body and
soulto the end o things and this I swear

While I spake thus my voice hoarse with passion my fingers clutching
his arm Penfeather stood pinching his chin and watching me beneath his
black brows when I had ended he turned and falls apacing to and fro
across the room as it had been the narrow poop of a ship

AhI know you now my lord says he pausing suddenly before me
As the sailorman who watched you as you lay agroaning in your sleep
outside the Conisby Arms I guessed you one o the Conisby breed by
your ring and as one born and bred here in Kent I mind well the adage
To hate like a Brandon and revenge like a Conisby and by God my
lord you are a true Conisby it seemeth Vengeance says he his
thin features grown sharp and austere Ah I have seen much and
overmuch of it aboard lawless craft and among the wild islands of the
Caribbees I have seen the devilish cruelties of Spaniard Portugal
and the red horrors of Indian vengeancebut for cold merciless
ferocity for the vengeance that dieth not biding its time and
battening on poisonous hate it needeth your man o noble birth your
gentleman o quality Here he turned his back and paced slowly to the
end of the room when he faced me again his austere look was gone in
its stead was the grimly whimsical expression of the mariner as I had
seen him first

Damme says I scowling Was it to read me homilies that you had me
here

Aha shipmate says he with rueful smile there spake the young
divine the excellent divinity student who committed a peccadillo long
years agone and sailing to the Golden West gave place to one Adam
Penfeather a sailormanas you shall hear tell of at St Kitts
Tortuga Santa Catalina and a score o places along the Main As to
yourself shipmate if tis only vengeance ye seek vengeance let it
be though when alls done tis but windhist Here cometh the
Bosuncome in Jo lad come in Twas trusty Joel Bym here gave me my
first lesson in navigationeh Jo

Aye Capn growled the hairy giant by cock them was the days a
fair wind a quick eye an no favour aye them was the days by
cocksbody So saying he placed a flask of wine on the table
together with a curious silver cup and at a sign from Penfeather
left us together

And now comrade says Penfeather filling the goblet draw up your
chair and do as I do

And now as we sat facing each other across the table Penfeather turns
back his left sleeve and whipping out a knife nicked himself
therewith on the wrist and squeezed thence a few drops of blood into
the wine which done he passed the knife to me and I though misliking
the extravagance of the thing nevertheless did the same

Martin says he give me your handso Now swear as I do And
thus clasping each others hands we swore the oath of brotherhood
and this as followeth viz

1 To keep ever each others counsel

2 To aid each other in all things against all men soever

3 To cherish and comfort each other in every adversity

4 To be faithful each to each unto the death

Thereafter at his command I drank of the wine wherein our blood was
mingled and he did the like

And now says he leaning back in his chair and viewing me with his
pensive smile since we be brothers and comrades sworn how dye like
me now

Better than I did says I speaking on impulse for sure you are the
strangest picaroon that ever cheated the gallows

Ah says he pinching his chin an I am neither hanged nor murdered
you shall one day find me a worshipful magistrate Martin Justice o
the Peace and quorumcustos rotulorum and the rest ont there my
ambition lies As for you Martin Lord Wendover there is your enemy
habloody vengeance and murder and what beside

That is mine own concern I retorted angrily And look ee since
comrades we are you will forget who and what I am

Why so I have Martin so I have Art a poor destitute rogue that
might be a man and rich but for this vengeful maggot i thy brain
Howbeit thourt my comrade sworn and brotherinarms and as such I
shall trust theeto the death Martin

And shall find me worthy Adamdespite thy curst tongue

Death is an ill thing Martin

Is it says I and laughed

Aye he nodded an ill thing to him that hath ambitions above the
brute See here Unbuttoning his doublet he showed me a shirt of
fine chainmail beneath his linen Twill turn any point ever forged
and stop a bullet handsomely as I do know

Why sure says I a little scornful you avowed yourself a cautious
man

True Martin I have another shirt the like o this for you And as
for caution I have need dye see comrade The arrow that flieth by
day is an ill enough thing but the knife that stabbeth i the dark is
worse This shirt hath turned death thrice alreadyonce i the breast
here and twice twixt the shoulders I am a man marked for death
Martin murder creepeth at my heels it hath dogged me overseas and
found me here in Kent at last it seems And comrade henceforth the
steel that smiteth me shall smite you also belike

And why is your life sought thus

By reason of a secret I bear about me wherefore saving only my good
friend Nicholas Frant who  perished I have ever been a solitary man
walking alone and distrustful of my fellows For Martin I have here
the secret of a treasure that hath been the dream and hope of roving
adventurers along the Main this many a yeara treasure beyond price
Men have sought it vainly have striven and fought suffered and died
for it have endured plague battle shipwreck famine have died
screaming neath Indian tortures languished in Spanish dungeon and
slaveship and all for sake of Bartlemys Treasure And of all that
ever sought it but one man hath ever seen this treasure and I am that
man Martin And this treasure is so marvellous well hid that without
me it shall lie unfound till the trump of doom But now since we are
brethren and comrades needs must I share with thee the treasure and
the secret of it

No no Adam says I Keep it to yourself Ill none of it

Share and share says he Tis the law of the Coast

None the less I want nought of it

Tis the law he repeated and moreover with such vast wealth a man
shall buy anything in this worldeven vengeance Martin Lookee now
heres the secret of our treasure Hereupon he thrust his hand into
his breast and drew out a small oilskin packet or bag suspended about
his lean throat by a thin steel chain and from this he drew forth a
small roll of parchment

Here tis Martin says he softly heres that so many lusty men
have perished fornot much to look at shipmate torn dye see and
stained but heres wealth Martin fame honours all the vices and
all the evils and chief among emvengeance

So saying he unrolled the small scrap of parchment and holding it
before me I saw it was a rough chart

Take it Martin and study it the while I tell you my story



CHAPTER XI

ADAM PENFEATHER HIS NARRATIVE

Mine is a strange wild story Martin but needs must I tell it and in
few words as may be Fifteen years agone or thereabouts I became one
of that league known as the Brotherhood of the Coast and swore
comradeship with one Nicholas Frant a Kent man even as I Now though
I was full young and a cautious man yet having a natural hatred of
Spaniards and their ways I wrought right well against them and was
mighty diligent in many desperate affrays against their ships and along
the Coast Twas I and my good comrade Nick Frant with sixteen lusty
lads took sea in an open pinnace and captured the great treasure
galleon Dolores del Principe off Carthagena and what with all this
Martin and my being blessed with some education and a gift of adding
two and two together I got me rapid advancement in the Brotherhood
untilwell shipmate I that am poor and solitary was once rich and
with nigh a thousand bully fellows at command And then it was that I
fell in with that archdevil that master rogue whose deeds had long
been a terror throughout the Main a fellow more bloody than any
Spaniard more treacherous than any Portugal and more cruel than any
IndianInca Mosquito Maya or Aztec and this man an Englishman and
one of birth and breeding who hid his identity under the name of
Bartlemy I met him first in Tortuga where we o the Brotherhood lay
six stout ships and nigh four hundred men convened for an expedition
against Santa Catalina and this for two reasons first because twas
a notable rich city and second to rescue certain of the Brotherhood
that lay there waiting to be burnt at the next autodefe Well
Martin tis upon a certain evening that this Bartlemy comes aboard my
ship and with him his mate by name Tressady And never was greater
difference than twixt these two Tressady being a great wild fellow
with a steel hook in place of his left hand dye see and Bartlemy a
slender daintyseeming fiendlysmiling gentleman very nice as to
speech and deportment and clad in the latest mode from curling periwig
to jewelled shoebuckles

Captain Penfeather says he Your most dutiful humbleha let me
parish but here is curst reek o tar with which Martin he claps a
jewelled pomander to the delicate nose of him Youve heard of me I
think Captain says he and of my ship yonder the Ladies
Delight I told him I had Martin bluntly and to the point whereat
he laughs and bows and forthwith proffers to aid us against Santa
Catalina the which I refused forthwith But my council of captains
seeing his ship was larger than any we possessed and exceeding well
armed and manned overruled me and the end of it was we sailed six
ships of the Brotherhood and this accursed pirate

Well Martin Santa Catalina fell according to my plans and the
Governor and Council agreeing to pay ransom I drew off my companies
and camped outside the walls of the town till they should collect the
money Now the women of this place were exceeding comely Martin in
especial the Governors lady and upon the second night was sudden
outcry and uproar within the city whereupon I marched into the place
forthwith and found this curst Bartlemy and his rogues grown
impatient were at their devils work Hastening to the Governors
house I found it gutted and him dragged from his bed and with the life
gashed out of himaye Martin torn body and throat dye see as by
the fangs of some great beast That was the first time I saw what a
steel hook may do As for this poor gentlemans lady she was gone
Hereupon we o the Brotherhood fell upon these pirate rogues and
fought them by light o the blazing houses for they had fired the
city and I thus espying the devil Bartlemy met him point to point
He was very full o rapier tricks but so was I Martin also I was
younger and winged him sore and had surely ended him but that
Tressady and divers others got him away and what with the dark night
and the woods that lie shorewards he together with some few of his
crew got them back aboard his ship the Ladies Delight and so
away but twelve of his rogues we took beyond divers we slew in fight
and those twelve I saw hanged that same hour A week later we sailed
for Tortuga with no less than ninety and one thousand pieces of eight
for our labour but I and those with me never had the spending of a
single piece Martin for we ran into a storm such as I never saw the
like of even in those seas Well we ran afore it for three days and
its fury nothing abating all this time I never quit the deck but I had
been wounded and on the third night being fevered and outworn turned
in below I was awakened by Nick Frant roaring in my ear for the
tempest was very loud and fierce

Adam cried he Were lost every soul and the good money weve
struck a reef Adam and tis the end and O the good money Hereupon
I climbed bove deck the vessel on her beam ends and in desperate
plight and nought to be seen i the dark save the white spume as the
seas broke over us None the less I set the crew to cutting away her
masts and heaving the ordnance overboard to lighten her thereby but
while this was doing comes a great wave roaring out of the dark and
dashing aboard us whirled me up and away and I borne aloft on that
mighty hissing sea strove no more doubting not my course was run
So blinded choking I was borne aloft and then Martin found myself
adrift in water calm as any millponda small lagoon and spying
through the dark a grove of palmetto trees presently managed to climb
ashore more dead than alive and lying there I prayeda thing I had
not done for many a year As the dawn came I saw the great wave had
hurled me over the barrier reef into this small lagoon and beyond the
reef lay all that remained of my good ship I was yet viewing this
dolorous sight and much cast down for the loss of my companions in
especial my sworn friend Nicholas Frant when I heard a sound behind me
and turning about espied a woman and in this womans face fair
though it was I read horror and sadness beyond tears and yet I knew
her for the same had been wife to the murdered governor of Santa
Catalina

Go back says she in Spanish pointing to the surf that thundered
beyond the reef Go back Here is the devilthe sea hath more
mercygo back whiles ye may And now she checked all at once and
falls ashivering for a voice reached us a mans voice asinging fair
to hear and the song he sang was this

 Hey cheerly O and cheerly O
 And cheerly come sing O
 While at the mainyard to and fro

and knowing this voice to my cost I looked around for some weapon
since I had none and was all but naked and whipping up a jagged and
serviceable stone stood awaiting him with this in my fist And down
the beach he comes jocund and debonair in his finery albeit something
pale by reason of excess and my rapier work And now I come to look at
you Martin he was just such another as you as to face and feature
though lacking your beef and bone Now he beholding me where I stood
flourishes off his belaced hat and making me a bow comes on smiling

Ah says he gaily tis Captain Penfeather of the Brotherhood
acollogueing with my latest wife Is she not a pearl o dainty
womanware Captain a sweet and luscious piece a passionate proud
beauty worth the tamingha Captain And she is tamed see you To
your dainty knees wenchdown Now though he smiled yet and spake
her gentle she bowing proud head sank to her knees crouching on the
ground before him while he looked down on her the devil in his eyes
and his jewelled fingers toying with the dagger in his girdle a
strange dagger with a hilt wrought very artificially in the shape of a
naked woman

How says I leaning across the table A woman Penfeather

Aye shipmate So I stood mighty alert my eyes on this dagger being
minded to whip it into his rogues heart as chance might offer I
wonder says he to this poor lady I wonder how long I shall keep
thee madonna a weeka montha year Venus knoweth for you amuse
me sweet Rise rise dear my lady my Dolores of Joy rise and aid
me with thy counsel for here hath this misfortunate clumsy Captain
fool blundered into our amorous paradise this tender Cyprian isle
sacred to our passion Yet here is he profaning our joys with his base
material presence How then shall we rid ourselves of this offence
The knifethis lover o men of mine The bullet Yet tis a poor
small naked rogue and in two days cometh my Ladies Delight and
Tressady with his hook See my Dolores for two days he shall be our
slave and thereafter for thy joy shall show thee how to die my
sweettorn twixt pimento trees or Tressadys hookthou shalt choose
the manner oft And now unveil unveil my goddess of the isleso
shall Ha Martin My stone took him neath the ear and as he
swayed reeling to the blow lithe and swift as any panther this
tortured woman sprang and I saw the flash of steel ere it was buried
in his breast Even then he didnt fall but staggering to a pimento
tree leans him there and falls alaughing a strange highpitched
gasping laugh and as he laughed thus I saw the silver haft of the
dagger that was a woman leap and quiver in his breast Then laughing
yet he never heeding me plucked and levelled sudden pistol and when
the smoke cleared the brave Spanish lady lay dead upon the sands

A noble piece Captain says he gasping for breath and then to
her Art gone my goddessIfollow thee And now he sinks to his
knees and begins to crawl where she lay but getting no further than
her feet by reason of his faintness he clasps her feet and kisses
them and laying his head upon themcloses his eyes Penfeather he
groans my treasurehiddendagger

Then I came very hastily and raised his head for I had oft heard talk
o this treasure and in that moment he died So I left them lying
and coming to the seaboard sat there a great while watching the break
o the seas on what was left o the wreck yet seeing it not I sat
there till noon Martin until driven by thirst and hunger and heat of
sun I set off to seek their habitation for by their looks I judged
them wellfed and housed But and here was the marvel Martin seek
how I might I found no sign of any hut or shelter save that afforded by
nature as caves and trees and was forced to satisfy my cravings with
such fruits as flourished in profusion for this island Martin is a
very earthly paradise That night the moon being high and bright I
came to that stretch of silver sand beside the lagoon where they lay
together rigid and pale and though I had no other tool but his dagger
and a piece o driftwood made shift to bury them neath the great
pimento tree that stood beside the rock and both in the same grave
Which done I betook me to a dry cave hard by a notable fall of water
that plungeth into a lake and there passed the night Next day
having explored the island very thoroughly and dined as best I might
on shellfish that do abound I sat me down where I might behold the
sea and fell to viewing of this silverhilted dagger

The which was shaped like to a woman says I

Aye Martin And now bethinking me of Bartlemys dying words anent
this same dagger and of the tales I had heard full oft along the Main
regarding this same Bartlemy and his hidden treasure I fell to
handling this dagger turning and twisting it this way and that And
suddenly shipmate I felt the head turn upon the shoulders twixt the
clasping hands turn and turn until it came away and showed a cavity
and in this cavity a roll of parchment and that parchment none other
than this map with the cryptogram the which I could make nought of

Now as I sat thus studying this meaningless jumble of words I of a
sudden espied a man below me on the reef a wild stormtossed figure
his scanty clothing all shreds and tatters and as he went seeking of
shellfish that were plenteous enough I knew him for my sworn comrade
Nick Frant And then Martin I did strange thing for bloodbrothers
though we were I made haste and all of a tremble to slip back this
map into its hidingplace which done I arose hailing my comrade and
went to meet him joyously enough And no two men in the world more
rejoiced than we as we clasped hands and embraced each other as only
comrades may It seemed the hugeous sea that had caught me had caught
him likewise and hurled him sore bruised some mile to the south of
the reef So now I told him of the deaths of Bartlemy and the poor
lady yet Martin and this was strange I spoke nothing of knife or
treasure I told him of the expectation I had of the pirates ship
return and yet I never once spake o the map and chart And methinks
the secret cast a shadow betwixt us that grew ever deeper for as the
days passed and no sail appeared there came a strangeness an unlove
betwixt us that grew until one day we fell to open quarrel disputation
and deadly strife and the matter no more than a dead mans shirt and
that ragged that had come ashore And we being in rags and the sun
scorching each claimed this shirt and from words came blows He had
his seamans knife and I Bartlemys accursed dagger and so we fought
after the manner of the buccaneers his leg bound fast to mine and
Martin though he was a great fellow and strong and wounded me sore in
the end I got in a thrust under the armpit and he fell adying and I
with him Then I seeing death in his eyes Martin clasped him in my
arms and kissed him and besought him not to die whereat he smiled
Adam says he Why Adam lad and so died

Then I took that accursed dagger wet with my comrades lifeblood
and hurled it from me and so with many tears and lamentations I
presently buried poor Nick Frant in the sands and lay there face down
upon his grave wetting it with my tears and groaning there till
nightfall But all next day Martin though my heart yearned to my
slain friend all next day I spent seeking and searching for the dagger
had killed him And as the sun set I found it Thereafter I passed
my days since the pirate ship came not doubtless owing to the late
tempest studying the writing on the chart here yet came no nearer a
solution though my imagination was inflamed by mention of diamonds
rubies and pearls as ye may see written here for yourself So the
time passed till one day at dawn I beheld a great ship her mizzen and
foretopmasts gone standing in for my island and as she drew nearer
I knew her at last for that accursed pirate ship called Ladies
Delight Being come to anchor within some halfmile or so I saw a
boat put off for the reef and lying well hid I watched this boat
steered by a knowing hand pass through the reef by a narrow channel
and so enter the lagoon Now in this boat were six men and at the
rudder sat Tressady and I saw his hook flash in the sun as he sprang
ashore Having beached their boat they fell to letting off their
calivers and pistols and hallooing

Oho Captain they roared Bartlemy ahoy And this outcry
maintained they for some while But none appearing to answer they
seemed to take counsel together and thereafter set off three and
three shouting as they went And now it seemed they knew no more of
Bartlemys hidingplace than I whereat I rejoiced greatly So lay I
all that forenoon watching their motions and hearing their outcries now
here now there until marvelling at the absence of Bartlemy they sat
down all six upon the spit of sand whereby I lay hid and fell to eating
and drinking talking the while though too low for me to hear what
passed But all at once they seemed to fall to disputation Tressady
and a small dark fellow against the four and thereafter to brawl and
fight though this was more butchery than fight Martin for Tressady
shoots down two ere they can rise and leaping up falls on the other
two with his hook So with aid from the small dark fellow they soon
have made an end o their four companions and leaving them lying come
up the beach and sitting below the ledge of rock whereon I lay snug
hidden fell to talk

So Ben camarado mio we be committed to it now Since these four
be dead and all men wellloved by Bartlemy needs must Bartlemy follow
em

Aye says the man Ben when we have found him Though Bartlemys a
fighting man

And being a man can die Ben And he once dead we stand his
heirsyou and I Ben I and you

Well and good says Ben But for this treasure where lieth it and
for that matter Roger where is Bartlemy

Both to find Ben so let us set about it forthwith The which they
did Martin for three days they sought the island over and I watching
em On the third day as they are sitting neath the great pimento
tree I have mentioned and I watching close by Tressady sits up all at
once

Ben says he What be yon and he pointed to a mound of sand hard
by

Lord knoweth says Ben

Yons been digging says Tressady and none so long since

Aye said Ben and now what

Now says Tressady let us dig likewise

Aye but what with says Ben

Our fingers says Tressady So there and then they fell to digging
casting up the loose sand with their two hands dogfashion and I
watching turned my head that I might not see

Ha says Tressady in a while Here is foul reek Ben foul reek

Right curst says Ben and then uttered a great hoarse cry And I
knowing what they had come upon kept my face turned away Tis she
says Ben in a whisper

Aye and him says Tressady Faugh Man tis ill thing but needs
musthis dagger Ben his dagger

Heres no dagger says Ben Heres empty sheath but no steel int

Tis fallen out says Tressady in a strangled voice Seek Ben
seek So despite the horror of the thing they sought Martin
violating death and careless of corruption they sought and all the
time the thing they sought was quivering in this right hand

Ben says Tressady when they were done Benhow came he
deadhow

Who shall say Roger Mayhap they did each others business

Why thenwheres the dagger o the womanthe silver goddesswhere
And how came they buried

Aye theres the rub Roger

Why says Tressady lookee Ben tis in my mind were not alone
on this island

And who should be here Roger

The man that slew our Captain Here there was silence awhile then
the man Ben arose and spat

Faugh says he Come away Roger ere I stiflecome i the
devils name So they went and I lying hid secure watched them out
of sight

Now when they were gone I took counsel with myself for here were two
desperate bloody rogues very well armed and here was I a solitary
man with nought to my defence save for Nicks knife and the
silverhilted dagger which was heavy odds Martin as youll agree
Now I have ever accounted myself a something timid man wherefore in
cases of desperate need and danger I have been wont to rely on my wit
rather than weapons on head rather than hands So now as I looked
upon this cursed dagger wherewith I had slain my poor friend beholding
this evil silver woman whose smile seemed verily to allure men to
strife and bloodshedthe end of it was I stole from my lurkingplace
and set the dagger amid the gnarled roots of the great pimento tree
where it might have slipped from dying fingers and so got me back into
hiding And sure enough in a while comes the big man Tressady
astealing furtivefashion and falls to hunting both in the open grave
and round about it but finding nothing steals him off again Scarce
was he out of eyeshot Martin than cometh the little dark fellow Ben
who likewise fell to stealthy search grubbing here and there on hands
and knees yet with none better fortune than his comrade But of a
sudden he gives a spring and stooping stands erect with Bartlemys
dagger in his hand Now scarce had he found it than comes Tressady
creeping from where he had lain watching

Ha Ben says he jovially How then lad how then Hast found
what we sought Heres luck Ben heres luck Aye by cock tis
your fortune to find it and your fortunes my fortune eh Benus
being comrades Ben

Aye says Ben turning the dagger this way and that

Ha ye come on the chart Ben ha ye found the luck int Ben

Stay Roger Ive but just picked it up

And was coming to your comrade with it eh Benshare and shareeh
BennoBennie

Aye says Ben staring down at the thing but twas me as found it
Roger

And what then lad what then

Why then Roger since I found it tis mine says he gripping the
dagger in quivering fist and glancing up sideways

Hilt and blade Ben

And the chart Roger

Aye and the chart Ben says Tressady coming a pace nearer and I
saw his hook glitter

And the treasure Roger says Ben making little passes in the air
to see the blue gleam of the steel

All yours Ben all yours and whats yours is mine according to
oath Ben to oath But come Ben you hold the secret o the treasure
in your fistthe silver goddess Come the chart lad out wi the
chart and Bartlemys jewels are ourspearls Bendiamonds
rubiesaha come find the chartlet your comrade aid ye lad

Stand back says Ben and whips a pistol from his belt Lookee
Roger says he I found the dagger without ye and Ill find the
chartstand back

Why heres ill manners to a comrade Ben ill manners sink mebut as
ye will Only out wi the chart and lets go seek the treasure Ben

Dye know the secret o this thing Roger

Not I Ben

Why then must I break it asunder Hand me yon piece o of rock
says Ben pointing to a heavy stone that chanced to be near

Stay Ben lad twere pity to crush the silver woman but if you
will you will Bentake a hold So saying Tressady picked up the
stone but as his comrade reached to take it let it fall whereupon
Ben stooped for it and in that moment Tressady was on him And
thenha Martin I heard the man Ben scream and as he writhed saw
Tressadys hook at work  the man screamed but once  and then
wiping the hook on his dead comrades coat he took up the dagger and
began to unscrew the head But now Martin methought twas time for
me to act if I meant to save my life for I had nought but Nick Frants
knife while within Tressadys reach lay the dead mans pistols and
divers musquetoons and fusees on the beach behind him which put me to
no small panic lest he shoot me ere I could come at him with my knife
Thus as I lay watching I took counsel with myself how I might lure
him away from these firearms wherewith he might hunt me down and
destroy me at his ease and the end of it was I started up all at once
and leaning down towards him shook the parchment in his face Ha
Tressady says I Is this the thing youve murdered your comrade
for Now at this Tressady sprang back to stare from me to the thing
in my hand Martin and thenha then with a wildbeast roar he sprang
straight at me with his hookeven as I had judged he would As for
me I turned and ran making for a rocky ledge I knew with Tressady
panting behind me his hook ringing on the rocks as he scrambled in
pursuit So at last we reached the place I soughta shelf of rock
the cliff on one side Martin and on the other a void with the sea
thundering far belowa narrow ledge where his great bulk hampered him
and his strength availed little And there we fought his dagger and
hook against my dead comrades knife and thus as he sprang I falling
on my knee smote up beneath raised arm heard him roar and saw him go
whirling over and down and splash into the sea

And he had the dagger with him Adam says I in eager question

Aye Martin which was the end of an ill rogue and an evil thing

The end says I the end Adam Why thenwhat o this

So saying I whipped the strange dagger from my wallet and held it
towards him balanced upon my palm Now beholding this Penfeathers
eyes opened suddenly wide then narrowed to slits as viewing this
deadly thing he drew back and back and so sat huddled in his chair
utterly still only I heard his breath hiss softly twixt clenched
teeth

Martin says he in the same hushed voice when a mans dead hes
dead and the dead can never come back can they shipmate

But now as we sat thus eyeing the evil thing on the table betwixt us
my answer died on my lips for there came a sharp quick rapping of
fingers on the lattice



CHAPTER XII

TELLETH OF A FIGHT IN THE DARK

Penfeather was at the casement had whipped open the lattice and
pinning the intruder by the throat thrust a pistol into his face all
in a moment and then I recognised Godby the peddler

Let be Adam I cried springing forward Let be heres a friend
Saying nothing Penfeather thrust away the weapon and gripping the
little man in both hands with prodigious strength jerked him bodily in
through the window which done he clapped to the lattice and drawing
the curtain stood fronting Godby grimlipped

And now what says he softly

Lord gasped Godby Lord love me but heres a welcome to a pal
heres the second pistol Ive had under my nose this nightthrottle me
in a hayband else

And the words running like this

 Two on a knife did part wi life
 And three a bullet took O
 But three times three died plaguily
 Awriggling on a hook O

Was that the way of it

Smother me if it werent quoth Godby staring

Sit down Godby and tell me how you chanced on this says Adam
seating himself at the table

Well master I happened to lie snug hid neath a heap o strawand

Brandons stablesand why there says you Says I to you because

Aye Heres a black passage to Captain Penfeathercurse him says
a voice Aye says another by knife or bullet or and here he
falls to singing of a knife and a bullet and a hook Avast says a
third voice Belay that Abny youll be having all the lubbers about

Answer fool whispers the big man Quick or shell be athwart our

cursed house down brick and brick

Godby says Adam suddenly leaning forward did ye get no glimpse o
this mans face

Nary a one master and for whythe place was dark and he wore a
great flapped hat

Why then says Adam pinching his chin did ye chance to see his
hands

No whit master and for whyhe wore a loose cloak about him

And what more did ye hear

No more master and for whybecause as luck would have it a straw
tickled my nose and I sneezed loud as a demiculverin and theres poor
Godby up and running for his life and these murderous rogues after poor
Godby Howbeit they durst not shoot lest they should alarm the house
and Im very light on my feet and being small and used to dodging
catchpolls and the like vermin I got safe away Having done which and
bethinking me of my pal Martin I made for the PeckoMalt Now as
luck would have it Gregory overtakes me as I had purposed he should
I being minded to get even wi him for good and all Down he gets
from the saddle and me by the collar and claps a great snaphaunce
under my nose So it was you ye rogue was it says he That
same says I but whos that peeping over the hedge there The fool
turns to see I twist the pistol out of his grip and have him very
neatly trussed and gagged with his belt and my girdle and so heaving
him i the ditch into the saddle and here I am

Godby says Penfeather viewing him keeneyed I need menwill ye
sail with us for the Main

Does Martin sail

He does Will ye along

Heartily captain heartily

Are ye armed Godby

Ive Gregorys dag here says Godby pulling out a longbarrelled
pistol

Joel shall find ye another to go with it And ye know the sea

Aye Captain I sailed with Captain Myddleton as gunner and will lay
you a gun with any man from a murderingpiece or minion to a great
culverin

Good says Penfeather and summoned Joel Bym who beholding the
peddler stared bellowed jovial greeting and at nod from Penfeather
departed with him arm in arm

Well Martin says Adam when the door had closed and what dye make
o this tale of sailormen

That theyre the same rogues I fell out with

Beyond doubt Martin And what more

That like enough theyre on their road hither

Beyond any peradventure shipmate

Well

Well let em come Martin let em come Theres somewhat here I
dont understand and I mislike mystery So let them come here in this
little room in light or dark I ask no better

And you such a timid man Adam

True Martin but theres occasion when a worm turneth Here he took
up the letter Godby had brought and breaking the seal read it through
once with a glimmer of his grim smile read it again and frowned and
frowning glanced across at me

Heres matter concerning you Martin harkee And he read this


To MASTER ADAM PENFEATHER

Should you chance upon the poore man that suffered lately in the
pillory by no order or will of mine you will I charge you do all you
may to succour him in any manner soever This letter I do write in
much haste to instruct you that I purpose to sail in the Faithfull
Friend along with you and my good cuzen Sir Rupert in this quest for
my father Moreover I will you should sail as speedily soon as may be

As regardeth the poore young man aforementioned if he be quite
destitute as I do think him and will take no money as I do judge most
like then Master Adam you shall offer to him such employ in my ship
the Faithfull Friend as he will accept

And this is my wish and command

JOAN BRANDON

He is great and tall and fierce with yellow hair and cruell mouth yet
seemeth more cruell than he trulie is


So there you are to a hair Martin and heres our enterprise brought
to nought if she sail on this venture

Why then she mustnt sail says I

Tis her ship Martin and shes a Brandon

Then sail without her

And be taken before were clear o the Downs and strung up at
Execution Dock for piracy

Why then if she goeth aboard I dont

And wherefore not Martin

Ill take no service with a Brandon

Aye verily theres your pride Martin which is cumbersome cargo

Call it what you will Ill not sail

And your oath comrade Sail along o me you must and shall But
having respect for your highstomached pride you shall stow away in
some hole or corner and she never know youre aboard

Hereupon I scowled but perceiving him so serene albeit a little grim
I said no more and he fell to pacing slowly back and forth head bowed
and hands locked behind him

I need you Martin says he at last aye I need you even more than
I thought the one man I may trust to in a pinch For Martin heres
that I dont understand

So saying he halted by the table and presently taking up the dagger
and with a strange reluctance fell to twisting it this way and that
finally he gave a sudden twist and the smiling head of the silver woman
coming away showed a hollow cavity running the length of the haft
roomy and cunningly contrived Slowly he fitted the head into place
again and laying the weapon down shook his head

Heres Bartlemys dagger true enough Martin says he touching its
keen point Heres what found Bartlemys black heartaye and many
another Heres what went hurtling over cliff in Tressadys fistand
yet here it lieswhich is great matter for wonder Martin And since
tis herewhy thenwhere is the vile rogue Tressady Which is
matter for painful speculation Martinwhere

Snoring likely enough says I Not so far hence or tramping
hither

If so Martin then Death cannot touch him the which is out of all
reason

Tis more like the fall did not kill him Adam

Had you but seen the place shipmate But if water wont drown him
and steel wont harm him

Like you he wears a chainshirt Adam that I do know Moreover the
devil cherisheth his own Ive heard

Why heres reason Martin plain reason I grant and yetbut tis
late and youll be for sleep and theres reason in that too Come
Ill show your bed

Spare yourselfI want no bed says I bitterly Twere a luxury
wasted on the likes o me My couch shall be the corner yonder

Ah prideful youth Tis sweet to be young Martin says Penfeather
with his sudden whimsical halfsmile and clapping his hand on my
shoulder Sleep where ye will that corner is as good as another
See there stands my tuck a Spanish blade of notable good temper it
hath been a true friend to me many a time ere now and should be a
trusty bedfellow As for me Im for a featherbed And Martin
says he pausing to pinch his chin and view me sideways if aught
should chance to meat any timethe chart and treasure will be yours
So goodnight comrade and sleep sound for tis like we shall wake
betimes

Saying which he turned slow and thoughtful and went out closing the
door softly behind him As for me being very drowsy I wrapped myself
in my weatherworn cloak blew out the candles and lying down in the
corner was presently fast asleep

Now as I slept I dreamed that Penfeathers long rapier standing in the
dark corner close by was stealthily endeavouring to free itself from
its leathern scabbard with intent to skewer me to the floor as I lay
and striving thus to draw itself made soft strange noises and
rustlings insomuch that I presently woke and staring motionless into
the darkness above knew that these sounds were real Somewhere close
by was a furtive whisper of sound that came and went a softdrawn
breath a scraping of fingers on the panelling above me in the
darkness and in that moment also I became aware that the lattice
yawned wide upon a square of glimmering blackness Suddenly a
slycreeping foot touched me unseen and then even as the owner of this
foot tripped over me came the roaring flash of a pistol hard by
followed immediately by another and as I lay deafened and halfdazed
the floor quivered to the soft vicious thud of leaping
swifttrampling feet and on the air was a confused scuffling mingled
with an awful beastlike worrying sound And now though I was
broadawake and tingling for action I constrained myself to lie still
nothing stirring for here as I judged was desperate knifeplay
indeed more than once I heard the faint click of steel And now rose
shouts and cries and a tramp of feet on the stair without Someone
reeled staggering across the room came ascrabbling at the open
casement and as I leapt up the door burst open and Joel Bym appeared
flourishing a naked hanger and with Godby behind bearing a lanthorn
whose flickering light showed Adam knife in hand where he leaned
panting against the wall a smear of blood across his pallid face and
with shirt and doublet torn in horrid fashion

The window he gasped Shutters Ware bullets I sprang
forward but Joel was before me and crouching beneath the open lattice
swung the heavy shutters into position but even as he did so a bullet
crashed through the stout oak

Doors all fast Joel

Aye Capn But whos hereist the preventive And me wi the
cellars chokefull My cock Ist the customs Capn

Worse Joel says Penfeather wiping sweat from him

Art hurt Adam I questioned eyeing his wild figure and now I saw
that the thin steel chain was gone from his sinewy throat

No shipmate But the dagger look yetis clean disappeared
Martin

And good riddance quoth I But Adamwhat o your chartgone
along o the dagger has it

Tush man says he sheathing his knife Tis snug in that wallet o
yours

My wallet I cried clapping hand on it where it hung at my girdle

Aye shipmate I slipped it there as I bid ye goodnight But
MartinO Martin the dead is alive againsee how Im all gashed with
his hook

Hook quoth Joel shooting great hairy head forward Did yesay
ahook Capn

Aye JoelTressadys alive again

God love us gasped the giant and sank into a chair



CHAPTER XIII

WE SET OUT FOR DEPTFORD POOL

Penfeather drew clenched hand across his brow and coming to the table
reached the halfemptied flagon and drank what remained of the wine
thirstily while Bym his great body huddled in the chair stared at
the bullet hole in the shutter with starting eyes as to me I picked
up Penfeathers fallen pistols and laid them on the table where Godby
had set the lanthorn

Tressady says Bym at last in a hoarse whisper TressadyO Capn
be ye sarten sure

Sure says Penfeather in the same hushed manner and reaching powder
and bullets from a cupboard he began methodically to reload his
pistols Hell be outside now where the shadows be thickest waiting
me with Abnegation and Sol and Rory and God knoweth how many more

Then he arent dead Capn Penfeathers black brows flickered and
his keen eyes glanced from his rent doublet round about the room

Howbeithe was here Joel said he

Why then Capn the dying womans curse holds and he cant die says
Bym clawing at his great beard

He was here Joel in this room says Penfeather busy with
powderhorn man to man knife to knifeand I missed him Since
midnight Ive waited wi pistols cocked and never closed eyeand yet
here was he or ever I was aware for as I sat there i the dark by the
window above the porch which is therefore easiest to come at I spied
Mings and him staring up at the lattice of this chamber So here
creeps I and opening the door saw him move against the open lattice
yondera shot no man could miss

Aye Capnaye

And Imissed him Joelwith both weapons and I within three yards of
him aye I missed him with both pistols

Which is small wonder says I for as you fired he tripped over me
Adam

And why should he trip just thenat the one and only moment Martin
Chance says you Why when he came leaping on me in the black dark
should his hook meet and turn my knife from his throat Chance again
says you Why when he flung me off and made for the windowwhy must
I catch my foot gainst that staff o yours and bring up against the
wall with all the strength and breath knocked out o me and no chance
for one thrust as he clambered through the lattice By the Lord
Martin heres more than chance says I

Aye by cock muttered Joel shaking his head Tis witched he be
Youll mind what I told ye Capnthe poor lady as died raving mad
aboard the Delight how she died cursing him wi life And him
standing by apolishing o that hook o hisah Capn Ill never
forget the work o that same hook  manys the time  Bartlemys
prisoners  men and women  aboard that cursed Ladies Delight
By cock I dream ont sometimes and wake all of a sweat

Heres no time for dreams says Penfeather ramming home the charge
of his second pistol Is the passage clear

Save for the matter of a few kegs Capn but twill serve

We start in half an hour Joel

The three o you Capn

Aye we must be aboard as soon as maybe now

Captain says Godby speaking as a mastergunner a mariner and a
peddler Im bold to say as theres nought like bite and sup to hasten
a man for a journey or aught besideflog me else And theres nought
more heartening than ham or neats tongue or brisket o beef the
which I chanced to spy i the kitchen

Why then mastergunner says Penfeather go you and engage those
same in close action and Ill join ye as soon as Ive shifted these
rags o mine

Adam says I unstrapping my wallet as Bym and Godby descended the
stair if we are to have our throats cut tonight twere as well I
handed back your chart first and I laid it on the table

Why tis as safe with you comradebut as you will says he
slipping the chain about his neck As for any throatslitting
Martin youll find that with danger my inborn caution groweth to
timidity

Ha yes I nodded Such timidity as walks under the very noses of
desperate wellarmed rogues of a moonlight night

Why the moon is downor nearly so Martin And then besides this
trim little inn hath divers exits discreetly nonapparent Twas a
monastery once Ive heard

And now a smugglingken it seems Adam

Even so comrade and no place better suited And theres the Bosn
hailing says he as a hoarse roar of Supper O reached us Go
down Martin I stay but to make things shipshape and he nodded
towards the books and papers that littered the table Upon the stairs I
met Godby who brought me to a kitchen very spacious and lofty paved
with great flagstones and with groined arches supporting the roof and
what with this and the wide fireplace flanked with fluted columns and
enriched by carvings I did not doubt that here had once stood a noble
abbey or the like

Pal said Godby as I stared about me youd never guess as there be
nigh three hundred kegs stowed hereabouts besides bales and the like
choke me else Ha manys the good cargo Ive helped Jo and the lads
to runeh Joel

So youre a smuggler Godby says I

Cock says Bym reproachfully and setting a goodly cheese on the
table with a bang say freetrader cocktother uns a cackling
word and I dont like cackle

Aye nodded Godby thats the word freetrader Martn So I am
and what then Twas summat o the sort as got me suspicioned by
Gregory and his catchpolls rot em But here Adam entered very
soberly dressed in sadcoloured clothes and we sat down to sup
forthwith

Do we sail soon Captain questioned Godby in a while

I hope to be clear o the Downs a few days hence says Adam

And you so shorthanded Capn quoth Bym

Sir Rupert hath listed thirty new men I hear and rogues every one
Ill be sworn

Sir Rupert says I

My ladys cousin Martin and captain of the expedition

Is he a sailor Adam

No Martin like most o your fine gentlemenadventurers he knows no
more of navigation than this cheese which is just as well Martin
aye mighty well

How so

Who shall say Martin who shall say And here he took a long
draught of ale In a while our meal being ended Penfeather rose

As to arms Martin ha ye aught beside your knife

My staff and this pistol says I taking out the silvermounted
weapon my lady Brandon had thrust upon me

Ist loaded Martin I examined charge and priming and nodded
Good says Adam Heres five shot betwixt us that should suffice
Up wi the trap Jo and well out Hereupon Bym lighted his lanthorn
and putting aside the great settle by the hearth stooped and raised
one of the flagstones discovering a flight of worn stone steps down
which we followed him and so into a great cellar or vaulted crypt
where stood row upon row of barrels and casks piled very orderly to
the stone roof Along the narrow way between strode Bym and halting
suddenly stooped and lifted another flagstone with more steps below
down which we followed him into a passageway fairly paved whence
divers other passages opened right and left And when we had gone some
distance Adam halted

Best bring the light no further Jo says he And harkee Joel as
to this black roguethisyknow who I mean Jo

Ayehim Capn

That same Jo Well keep an eye lifting and if you find out aught
worth the telling let one o your lads ride post to Deptford Jo

Aye Capn Aboard ship

Aboard ship

Capn quoth he grasping Adams hand Im man o few words an
thanks t you Im snug enough here wi my wife and darter as is away
till this cargos run but say the word and Ill sail along o you
come battle murder or shipwreck

Or a hook Joel says Penfeather softly whereat Joel clawed at his
beard and blinked into the lanthorn finally he gives a great tug to
his beard and nods

Aye Capn says he for youeven that by cock

Good lad says Penfeather clapping him on brawny shoulder Bide
where you are Jo and Fortune with you and yours This way Martin

So having taken our leave of Bym Godby and I followed Adam along the
passage guided by the Bosns lanthorn until turning a sudden sharp
corner we plunged into pitchy gloom wherein I groped my way until
Penfeathers voice stayed me

Easy all says he softly Have your pistols ready and heed how you
come Creeping cautiously I found myself amid leaves that yielded
before me and stepping through this natural screen I stumbled into a
bush and presently found myself standing in a small copse dimlighted
by a waning moon and never a sound to be heard save the soft whisper
of leaves about us and the faint far cry of some nightbird

Ha says Adam at last gazing away to the sinking moon So our
journey begins and from the look o things Martin from the look o
things heres going to be need of all your resolution and all my
caution ere we can see the end Come



CHAPTER XIV

HOW I CAME ABOARD THE FAITHFUL FRIEND

We followed a roundabout course now across broad meadows now treading
green carttracks now climbing some grassy upland anon plunging into
the shadow of lonely wood or coppice until the moon was down until was
a glimmer of dawn with lowlying mists brimming every grassy hollow and
creeping phantomlike in leafy boskages until in the east was a glory
warming the grey mist to pink and amber and gold and the sun
uprising darted his level beams athwart our way and it was day

And now from coppice and hedgerow near and far was stir and flutter
a whistling and a piping that rose ever louder and swelled to a
trilling ecstasy of gladness

Hark to emO pal hark to em quoth Godby lifting head to watch a
lark that soared aloft Heres music Martin heres cure for the
megrims hope for the downcast and promise o joys to come O hark to
em

All the day Penfeather led us on by lonely ways never seeming to weary
and never at a loss silent for the most part as one in profound
thought and I speaking little as is my wont but Godby talked and sang
and laughed for the three of us

It was as we sat outside a little alehouse snugged mid trees eating
of bread and cheese that Penfeather turned suddenly and gripped my arm

Martin says he twill be plaguy business carrying women aboard
shipalong o these lambs o minetheres scarce a rogue but cheats
the gallows with his every breath

Why then tell her so Adam plain and to the point

Twould be vain breath Martin I know her too welland she is a
Brandon

A curse on the name says I whereupon Godby choked into his ale
stared in surprise and would fain have questioned me but meeting my
eye spake no word

Dye know aught of navigation Martin says Adam suddenly

No whit Adam but Ill handle a boat with any man

Ha says he and sat there pinching his chin until our hunger being
appeased and the ale all drank we fared on again So we tramped and
though our road was long I will here make short work of it and say that
at last we came very hot and dusty into the village of Lewisham
where we would fain have baited awhile at the Lion and Lamb a fair
inn but this Adam would by no means permit so leaving the village
we presently turned aside from the main road into a lane very
pleasantly shaded by tall trees and bloomy hedgerows the which as I
do think is called Mill Lane In a while we reached a narrow track
down which Adam turned and now as we went I was aware of strange
sounds a confused hubbub growing ever louder until deep amid the
green we espied a lonely tavern before which stood a short stout man
who alternately wrung his hands in lamentation mopped at bloody pate
and stamped and swore mighty vehement in the midst of which chancing
to behold Penfeather he uttered joyful shout and came running

Master Penfeather cried he O Master Penfeather heres fine
doings love my eyes Heres your rogues afighting and amurdering of
each other which is no great matter but heres them awrecking o my
house which is great matter heres them has broke my head wi one o
my own pottlepots which is greater matter heres me dursent set of
it i the place and my wife and maids all of a swoundO Master
Penfeather heres doings love my limbs

Ha says Penfeather fighting are they Jerry

Like devils Captain your rogues and the rogues as my Lord Dering
listed and brought here yesterdayO love my liverlook at yon As
he spoke was a crash of splintered glass and a broken chair hurtled
through the wide lattice

So says Adam striding towards the inn and I saw a pistol in his
hand Following hard on his heels I entered the inn with him and so to
the scene of the riot

A long low room full of swirling dust and amid this choking cloud a
huddle of men who fought and struggled fiercely roaring blasphemy and
curses Two or three lay twisted among overturned chairs and tables
others had crawled into corners to look to their hurts while to and
fro the battle raged the fiercer Leaning in the doorway Penfeather
surveyed the combatants with his quick keen glance and then the hubbub
was drowned by the roar of his long pistol the thunderous report
seemed to stun the combatants to silence who falling apart turned
one and all to glare at the intruder And in this moment of
comparative silence while all men panted and stared from Penfeathers
grim lips there burst a string of blistering seaoaths such as even I
had scarce heard till now for a long minute he reviled them the smoke
curling from his pistol his black brows knit across glittering eyes
his thin nostrils aquiver the scar glowing on his pallid cheek his
face indeed so changed and evil that I scarce knew him

 ye filthy scum ye lousy sons o dogs he ended Ha will ye
fight agin my orders thenmutiny is it

And who a plague are you and be cursed to ye panted a great fellow
flourishing a broken chairleg threateningly and scowling in murderous
fashion

Hell tell yethere behind ye fool snarled Penfeather pointing
sinewy finger The big man turned Penfeather sprang with uplifted
pistol and smote him stunned and bleeding to the floor then
bestriding the prostrate carcass fronted the rest with head viciously
outthrust

And whos nextcome says he softly scowling from one to other of
the shrinking company You Amos Penarth and you Richard Farnaby
aye and half a dozen others o ye youve sailed wi me ere now and you
know when I say a thing I mean it And youd fight would ye my last
words to you being see to it there be no quarrelling or riot

Why Capn says one tis all along o these new listed rogues

Aye master says another and thats gospeltrue theer arent a
right sailorman among em

Then well learn em to be says Penfeather Stand forward the new
menshow a leg and bustle ye dogs Scowling and muttering some
twelve unlovely fellows obeyed I faith says Penfeather looking
them over Heres fine stuff for the gallows And wheres the rest of
em

Gone aboard this morning along o Toby Hudd the bosun

See here my bright lads quoth Penfeather eyeing each scowling face
in turn learn thiswhen you come aboard my ship and I say to one o
ye do this or do that he does it dye see orup to the yardarm he
swings by his thumbs or his neck as occasion warrants Dye get me my
bully roarers

Not a man of them spake a word but all stood shifting uneasily beneath
Penfeathers quick bright eye shuffling their feet and casting furtive
glances on their fellows

Now as to this lump o roguery says Penfeather spurning the still
unconscious man with his foot have him into the yard and heave a
bucket o water over him As to you Farnaby muster the hands and
stand by to go aboard in half an hourevery unhung rascal

Without we came on the misfortunate landlord still in the deeps of
gloom but upon Adams assurance that all damages should be made good
he brought us up a pair of stairs to a fair chamber and there served us
a most excellent meal

Scarce had we risen from table than comes the man Penarth aknocking
cap in hand to say the men stood ready to go aboard We found some
score fellows drawn up before the inn and a desperate lot of
cutthroats they looked what with their hurts and general hangdog air
as they stood there in the light of a rising moon Having looked them
over each and every Penfeather spat and setting them in Godbys
charge ordered them to go on before

Well Martin says he as we followed together and how think ye of
my lambs

Call them raging tigers rather

Nay says he tigers be cleanly creatures Ive heard

A Gods name Adam why truck with such ill rogues Sure there be
many honest mariners to be had

Why as to that Martin good men be scarce and ever hard to come
bymoreover these scum are a means to an end dye see

How so

Just that Martin says he glancing at me in his furtive manner a
means to an end

What end

Ah who may tell Martin he sighed shaking his head Now when I
would have questioned him further he put me off thus with side answers
until we were come to the waterside which is called Deptford Creek
Here having seen the others safe embarked we took boat also and were
soon rowing between the huge bulk of ships where dim lights burned and
whence came ever and anon the sound of voices the rattle of a
hawser a snatch of song and the like as we paddled betwixt the vast
hulls Presently we were beneath the towering stern of a great ship
and glancing up at this lofty structure brave with carvedwork and
gilding I read the name

 THE FAITHFULL FRIEND


At a word from Adam the oars were unshipped and we glided alongside her
highcurving side where hung a ladder up which I followed Adam
forthwith She was a great ship as I say of some two hundred tons at
least with high forecastle and lofty stern though I saw little else
ere at a sign from Adam I followed him down the aftergangway where
taking a flickering lanthorn that hung from a deckbeam he led me
twixt a clutter of stores not yet stowed past the grim shapes of
great ordnance and so down and down to a noisome place beneath the
orlop

Tis not over sweet Martin says he but then bilgewater never is
youll mind But youll grow used to it in time shipmate unless
instead o swallowing this unholy reek youll swallow your pride and
list as masters mate

Ive no knowledge of navigation says I

But Ive enough for the two of us Martin Tis a comrade at my back
I need Whats the word

No says I mighty short

As you will shipmate he sighed as you will Pride and
bilgewater go well together which said he brought me to a dark
unlovely hole abaft the mizzen Tis none too clean Martin says
he casting the light round the dingy place but that shall be
remedied and Godby shall bring ye bedding and the like so although
tis plaguy dark and wi rats aplenty still despite the stench
youll lie snug as your pride will permit of As for me shipmate I
shall scarce close an eye till we be clear o the Downs so tis a
carefull man I shall be this next two days heigho So goodnight
Martin Ill send Godby below with all you lack

Saying which Penfeather turned and groping his way into the darkness
left me scowling at the flickering lanthorn



CHAPTER XV

TELLETH OF A NAMELESS BLACK SHIP

And now within my gloomy hidingplace dimlit by flickering lanthorn
I passed many weary hours while all about me was a stir and bustle a
confused sound made up of many as the neverending tread of feet the
sound of hoarse voices now faint and far and anon clear and loud the
scrape of a fiddle snatches of rough song the ceaseless ring and tap
of hammersa very babel that telling of life and action made my
gloomy prison the harder to endure And here mindful of what is to
follow I do think it well to describe in few words the place wherein I
lay It was indeed a very doghole just below the orlop some ten feet
square or thereabouts shut in twixt bulkheads mighty solid and
strong but with a crazy door so illhung as to leave a good three
inches twixt it and the flooring It had been a storeroom as I
guessed and judging by the reek that reached me above the stench of
the bilge had of late held rancid fat of some sort just abaft the
mizzen it lay and hard against the massy rudderpost for I could hear
the creek and groan of the pintles as the rudder swung to the tide
Against one bulkhead I had contrived a rough bunk with divers planks
and barrels the which with mattress and bedding was well enough

Now opposite my berth within easy reach of my hand was a knothole
the which by some trick of the grain had much the look of a great
staring eye insomuch that having no better employ I fell to
improving on natures handiwork with my knife carving and trimming
around it and in betwixt my sleeping my eating and drinking for Adam
and Godby kept me excellent well supplied I would betake me to my
carving and fashioning of this eye and with my initials below it the
which foolish business fond and futile though it was served in no
small measure to abate my consuming impatience and the dreary tedium

Howbeit on the third day my situation becoming unbearable I stumbled
out from my doghole and groping my way past kegs and barrels
firmwedged in place against the rolling of the vessel I climbed the
ladder to the orlop Here I must needs pause for dim though it was
the light from the open scuttle nigh blinded me In a while my eyes
growing strong I got me to the maindeck where again I must stay to
shade my eyes by reason of the radiance that poured through an open
gunport Glancing around after some while I saw no one and wondered
for here was the main gundeck Ten great pieces a side I counted
with ports for divers more I was yet wondering at the emptiness about
me when I heard sudden uproar from the deck above my head shouts
cries a rush and patter of many feet and above all Penfeathers
furious hail

Wondering I came to the open port and leaning out saw it was evening
with a heavy mist creeping down upon the waters and through the mist
loomed a great black ship drifting lubberly across our hawse Louder
and more furious grew the shouting above answered by a hail aboard the
great black craft as broadside on she swung towards us

And now creeping in the mist I beheld a small boat with a great
shapeless bundle in the sternsheets and rowed by a single waterman who
swung easily to his oars scanning now the Faithful Friend now the
great black ship like one who bided the inevitable crash Sudden I
heard the roar of one of Penfeathers everready pistols followed by
his voice up raised in vicious seacurses and glancing up saw the
black ship right aboard of us and braced myself for the impact came a
shock a quiver of creaking timbers and the groan of our straining
hawsers as the black ship falling off drifted by in a roaring storm
of oaths and blasphemy Now when her battered sterngallery was nigh
lost in the mist bethinking me of the boat I had seen I glanced about
and beheld matter that set me wondering for he was the fellow plying
his oars with a will and so near that I might have tossed a biscuit
aboard him moreover the great misshapen bundle had lain in the
sternsheets was there no longer which set me mightily awondering
Long after man and boat were swallowed up in the fog I sat there lost
in thought insomuch that I started to feel a hearty clap on the
shoulder and turning beheld Godby a pair of great gold rings in his
ears and very sailorlike in all things from seaboots to mariners
bonnet

Heres a ploy Martn says he with a round oath Heres yon curst
lubberly craft carried away our starboard cathead and sixfeet o the
harpings wit sink him And us but waiting for my lady to come aboard
to trip anchor and away And now heres we shorebound for another two
days at the least as Im a gunner And all on account of yon black dog
burn him A plaguy fine craft as sails wi no name on her anywheres
keelhaul me else But Penfeather winged one o the lubberly rogues
praise God Martn Which done and with due time to curse em every
mothers son of em he turns tohim and the carpenter and his
matesthere and then to repair damages Ha a man o mark is Captain
Adam pal

Godby says I did ye chance to see aught of a boat carrying a great
bundle in the sternsheets and rowed by a man in a red cap

Nary a blink Martnwhy

Im wondering what came of that same bundle

Hove overboard belike paltheres many a strange thing goes
afloating out to sea from hereabouts Martndrownd me

Belike youre right says I

Martn Sir Ruperts ashore to meet her ladyship so youm free to
come bove deck if so minded

Nay Ill bide where I am Godby

Why then come Martn clap your eye on my beautiesheres guns
Martn six culverins and tothers sakers and yonder astern two
basilisks as shall work ye death and destruction at two or three
thousand paces bove deck amidships Ive divers goodly pieces as
minions falcons and patereros with murderers mounted aft to sweep the
waist For her size shes well armed is the Faithful Friend Martn

Thus Godby as he led me from gun to gun slapping hand on breech or
trunnion and as I hearkened twas hard to recognise the merry peddler
in this short square gravefaced gunner who spake with mariners
tongue hitched ever and anon at the broad belt of his galligaskins
and rolled in his gait already

Shes a fair ship says I seating myself on one of the great guns
mounted astern

She is so Martn Theres no finer eer sailed from Deptford Pool
which is saying much split me if it isnt Though when alls said
Martin I could wish for twenty more men to do justice to my noble
guns aye thirty at the least

Are we so short

We carry but ninety and two all told pal which considering my guns
is pityaye vast pity plague me else Twould leave me shorthanded
to serve my guns should they be necessary which is fair and likely
Martin

And black rogues they are says I

Never clapped eyes on worse pal kick me endwise else But Captain
Adams the man for such and I mean to work em daily each and every
at my guns as soon as we be well at sea Ah there soundeth Toby
Hudds pipeall hands on deckthis should be her ladyship coming
aboard So heres me aloft and you alow and good luck to both pal
Saying which he nodded gave a hitch to his wide galligaskins and
rolled away Now coming to the gunport I have mentioned I must needs
pause there awhile to look out across the misty river already darkening
to evening and thus presently beheld a boat vague and blurred at
first but as it drew nearer saw in the sternsheets four gallants who
laughed and talked gaily enough and the muffled forms of two women
and in one from the bold free carriage of her head I recognised
despite hood and cloak my Lady Joan Brandon nay as the boat drew in
I heard the sweet vital tones of her voice and with this in my ears I
caught up my lanthorn and so descended to the orlop Now as I paused
at the narrow scuttle that gave down to my noxious hidingplace I
thought to hear a step somewhere in the gloom below

Ha Godby says I Are you down there man But getting no
answer I descended the ladder bethinking me of the rats whereof I
had no lack of company and coming into my doghole closed the
rickety door and having supped cast myself down upon my bed and blew
out the light and despite the rustle and scutter away there in the
dark beyond my crazy door I was very soon asleep

And in my sleep what must I dream of but rats with eyes that glared in
the dark that crawled ever nearer while one that crept upon my bosom
grew and swelled into a great fellow with a steel hook in place of one
hand a face with flashing white teeth and glowing eyes that peered
close ere eyes and teeth vanished and I sunk down and down into a
black emptiness of dreamless slumber



CHAPTER XVI

TELLS HOW WE WERE DOGGED BY THE BLACK SHIP

I awoke in panic and leaping up groped in the pitchdark until my
eager fingers closed on the haft of the sheathknife under my pillow
and with this naked in my hand I crouched awaiting I knew not what for
all about me was direful sound groans and cries with wailings long
drawn out in shuddering complaint Then all at once my panic was
lost in sudden great content and thrusting away the knife I took flint
and steel and therewith lighted my lanthorn since now indeed I knew
these dismal sounds nought but the creak and groan of the stout ship
the voice of her travail as she rose to the seas And as I hearkened
every individual timber seemed to find a voice and what with this and
the uneasy pitching and rolling of the ship I judged we were well under
weigh and beyond the rivermouth This bethinking me of the damage we
had sustained from the great black ship set me to wondering insomuch
that I reached for my lanthorn minded to steal on deck that I might
know our whereabouts and if it were day or night since here in the
bowels of the ship it was always night So as I say I reached for
the lanthorn then paused as above all other sounds rose a cheery hail
and under the door was the flicker of a light Hereupon I opened the
door though with strangely awkward fingers and thus espied Godby
lurching towards me

What Martn pal says he sitting beside me on my berth and setting
down the food and drink he had brought are ye waking at last

Have I slept long Godby

Youve slept Martn a full thirty hours

Thirty hours Godby

Split me crosswise else pal

Mighty strange says I reaching for the flask he had brought for I
felt my mouth bitterly parched and dry while added to the consuming
thirst my head throbbed miserably

Well here we be pal clear o the river this twelve hours and more
And Martn this is a shipaye by hokey a sailer So true on a
wind so sweet to her helm and Master Adams worthy of her blister me
else

Tis strange I should sleep so long says I clasping my aching head

Why youm wise to sleep all ye can pal seeing there be nought
better to do here i the dark says he setting out the viands before
me What no appetite Martn I shook my head Lord love ye
tis the dark and the curst reek o this place palcome aloft alls
bowmon the fine folk hant found their sealegs yet nor like to while
this wind holds Martnso come aloft wi Godby

Nothing loth I rose and stumbled towards the ladder marvelling to find
my hands and feet so unwieldy as I climbed the higher I went the more
the rolling and pitching of the ship grew on me so that when at last I
dragged myself out on deck it was no wonder to find the weather very
blusterous and with ever and anon clouds of white spray lashing
aboard out of the hissing dark with much wind that piped shrill and
high in cordage and rigging

Being sheltered by the high bulwark hard beside the quarterdeck
ladder I leaned awhile to stare about me and drink in great draughts
of sweet clean air so that in a little my head grew easier and the
heaviness passed from me Ever and anon the moon peeped through wrack
of flying cloud by whose pale beam I caught glimpses of bellying sails
towering aloft with their indefinable mass of gear and rigging and the
heel and lift of her looming forecastle as the stately vessel rose to
the heaving seas or plunged in a white smother of foam

She rides well Martn roared Godby in my ear Aha heres duck of
a ship pal

Wheres Adam I questioned

Togallant poop Martn Lord love ye its little sleep hes had
since we hove anchor Harkee palhes got it into his head as wem
being dogged

Dogged manby what

By that same great black ship as fouled ushe has so palroast me
else But come your ways So saying Godby climbed to the
quarterdeck and I after him and mounting the poopladder presently
came on Penfeather peering hard over our lee

Ha is it you shipmate says he drawing me out of the wind Look
yonder dye see aught of a rag o sail Martin Following his
pointing finger I stared away into the distance across a tumbling
spume of waters vague in the halflight Dye glimpse aught Martin

Nothing Adam

Wait for the moon shipmatenow look yonder As the light grew I
swept the distant horizon with my eyes until all at once against the
night I saw the sheen of distant canvas that gleamed and was gone
again as a cloud veiled the moon You saw it Martin

Plainly says I whereupon he sprang away to the men at the helm
came the hoarse roar of speakingtrumpet and decks and waist below
seemed alive with scurrying dim figures and now was a chorus of
shouts and yohoing as the Faithful Friend obedient to his
commands swung off upon an altered course

Godby says Adam beckoning us where stood the compass or bittacle
lookee as she bears now we should be nigh enough yon curst ship to
learn more of her by peep o dawn

Aye Capnand then

Then you shall try what you can do wi one o those long guns o
yours

Lord love ye Capn thats the spirit cried Godby hitching
joyously at his broad belt All I asks is a fair light and no favour

And you have the middle watch Godby man so Ill get a wink o
sleep says Adam but do you call me so soon as we raise her hull
As for you Martin youll have slept your fill I judge

And yet Im plaguy drowsy still says I

Theres a spare berth in the coach comrade an youre so minded

Nay Adam Ill watch awhile with Godby

Good Youve keen eyes Martinuse em says he and goes down the
ladder forthwith

And now pacing the lofty poop beside Godby I was aware that the
Faithful Friend was dark fore and aft not a light twinkled anywhere

How comes this Godby says I pointing to the dim shapes of the
great stern lanthorns above us

Capns orders Martn Weve been dark these two nights and yet if
yon craft is what we think twould seem she follows us by smell pal
smell As how say you Says I last night she was fair to be seen
having closed us during the day so out go our lights and up goes our
helm and we stand away from her At dawn she was nowhere and yethere
she is againif yon ship be the same

Which we shall learn in an hour or so Godby

Aye Martn if she dont smell us acoming and bear away from us
And yet she must be a clean fast vessel but well overhaul her going
roomer or on a bowline

Roomer Speak plain Godby Im no mariner

Timell teach ye pal Lookee now roomer means large and
large means free and free means wi a quarteringwind and that
means going away from the wind or the wind astarn of us whiles on a
bowline means closehauled agin the wind dye see

Godby tis hard to believe you that same peddler I fell in with at
the Hoppole

Why Martn Im a cove as adapts himself according Give me a pack
and Im all peddler and jy in it gie me a ship and Im all mariner
to handle her sweet and kind and lay ye a course wi anythough guns
is my meat Martn Fifteen year I followed the sea and a man is apt
to learn a little in such time So here stand I this day not only
gunner but masters mate beside of as tight a ship maugre the crew as
ever sailedand all along o that same chance meeting at the
Hoppole

And though a friend of Bym you knew little of Adam Penfeather

Little enough Martn Joel be no talkerbut it do seem Jo was one
of the CoastBrotherhood once when Capn Penfeather saved his life and
that years agone So Joel comes home and sets up marriage freetrade
and what not when one day lately Master Adam walks into the Peck o
Malt and no whit changed for all the years save his white hair And
here comes rain Martn

And wind says I as the stout ship reeled and plunged to the howling
gust

No Martn roared Godby above the piping tumult not real wind
pala stiffish breezejolly capful

Slowly the night wore away and therewith the buffeting wind gentled
somewhat gradually in the east was a pale glimmer that growing
showed great black masses of torn cloud scudding fast above our
reeling mastheads and all about us a troubled sea But as the light
grew look how I might nowhere could I descry aught of any ship upon
that vast horizon of foaming waters

Ha says Godby venting huge sigh theres to be no play for my guns
this day Martn

Nay but says I mighty perplexed whats come of her She could
never have marked our change of course at the distance and twas black
dark beside and we bore no lights

Mayhap she smelt us pal as I said afore Howbeit tis beyond me
cram me wi ropeyarn else

Now as he spoke up came the sun turning lowering sky and tempestuous
ocean to glory every ragged cloud became as it were streaming banners
enwrought of scarlet and gold every foaming billow a rolling splendour
rainbowcapped insomuch that I stood awed by the very beauty of it all

I love the good kind earth Martn wi its green grass and flowers
a peep tis a fair restingplace for a man when alls done and said
but yonder palah theres glory for ye Manys the time Ive
watched it dawn and sunset and minding all the goodly ships and the
jolly lads as are asleeping down below at such times Martn it do
seem to me as if all the good and glory of em came aloft for eyes to
see awhilehowbeit tis a noble windingsheet pal from everlasting
to everlasting amen And by that same token the winds veering which
meaneth a fairweather spell and I must trim Meantime do you rouse
Master Adam And here setting hands to mouth Godby roared high
above the wind

Watch ho Watch Brace aboutbowse away there

As I crossed the deck up the poop ladder comes Adam himself his red
seamans bonnet tightdrawn about his ears and a perspectiveglass
under his arm Tis as I thought Martin says he pinching his chin
and scowling away to leeward she changed course as we did

Nay but Adam how should she know we changed and the night so black

Very easily shipmate by means of a light

We bore no lights Adam

None the less someone aboard this ship signalled yon black craft by
means of a lanthorn tis beyond doubt

And why should she follow us think ye

Why am I a marked man shipmate why have I been dogged hither and yon
across seas Come into the coach and Ill tell ye a thing Godby
says he coming where Godby stood beside the steersman lay her on her
old course Tis Merrilees takes next watch I thinktell him to warn
me as soon as we raise her accursed topsails

What says I as we climbed from the lofty poop you think she will
dog us still then

I know it Martin says he gloomily and so brought me into a
smallish cabin under the topgallant poop here were bunks to larboard
and starboard with a table midway furnished with calendars charts a
crossstaff an astrolabe with globes and the like while against the
walls stood rows of calivers musquetoons and fusees set in racks very
orderly Aye shipmate says he noting my gaze every firelock
aboard is either here or in the armchests i the roundhouse below
and our powder is all stored well aft by reason that I am a cautious
man dye see Sit ye Martin Now as to this black shipfirst of
all she fouls us in the river the which was no accident Martin
though just what the motive was Im yet aseeking Second as she
drifted past us whom should I see aboard her but Abnegation Mings and
pulled trigger a moment too late but winged another o the rogues
Third when wed repaired our damage and got us clear of the river what
should we see but this same black ship hove short waiting us for she
presently stands after us And so shes dogged us ever since and so dog
us she will to the worlds end unless I can bring her to action

Shes a fighting ship by her looks and heavily armed says I

So are we Martin

And our men Adam

Ah says he pinching his chin there it is Martin there it is
Lookee shipmate in all this crew there are no more than twenty men I
can count on nay lessten only can I swear by See now heres you
and Merrilees and Godby heres Farnaby and Toby Hudd the bosun
Treliving the carpenter and McLean his mate heres Robins and Perks
and Taffery the armourergood mariners all These I can trust
shipmate but never another one

And what of the captain Sir Rupert Dering

That Martin says Penfeather snapping his fingers A very
gentlemanlike fool dye see a bladder of airlike his three
fellows

So we have four gentlemen aboard Adam

Ayeprincocks all that do nothing but vie in court to her ladyship
Now lookee Martin what with one thing or another and this hellfire
ship on our heels in especial theres stir and disaffection among the
crew awhispering o corners that I dont like and which is apt to
spread unless looked to Wherefore this morning I ordered a certain
redhaired rascal fifty lashes athwart a gun But the bosun had laid
on but poor ten and the fellow roaring lustily when into the
tweendecks cometh my lady in mighty taking and seeing the rogues
back a little bloody ordered him freed and thereafter cossets him wi
dainties from her own table Lord love ye Which cometh o women
aboard ship And here Adam sighed mighty dismal

Why then says I heres work for me belike

As how Martin

Nay leave it to me being little better than rogue myself I should
know how to outmatch roguery

Meaning youll spy on em shipmate

And lie and cozen and join fellowship with em if need be Howbeit
theres aught afoot Ill bottom it one rascally fashion or tother

Tis desperate risk Martin and should they suspicion you

Why look Adam my lifes none so sweet or precious that Id cherish
it in lavender Besides Ive a feeling I may not die untilat least
not yet

Wait says he as I rose Bide a while Martin And opening a
locker beneath his bunk he took thence a shirt of fine chainwork like
that he himself wore Shaking my head I would have put it by but he
caught my arm in his powerful grip and shook me insistent Take it
Martin says he take it man tis easy and pleasant as any glove
yet mighty efficacious gainst point or edge and you go where knives
are sudden Stay then take it for my sake shipmate since trusty
comrades be few and mighty hard come by So in the end I did it on
beneath my doublet and found it to irk me nothing And now what he
questioned as I opened the door

Sleep says I yawning

Theres a bunk yonder Martin says he eyeing me twixt narrowed
lids

Nay Im for my doghole Adam

You seem to sleep much and mighty well despite stench and rats
shipmate

Im grown used to em says I with another yawn and as to sleeping
I do little else of latetis the dark belike or bad air or lack of
exercise Now as I rose to be gone the deck seemed to heave oddly
beneath my feet and the cabin to swing dizzily round so that I must
needs grip at the table to steady myself while Adam peered at me
through a haze as it were

Whats here Martin are ye sick he questioned

A vertigo I mumbled Ill into the air In a little the dizziness
abating I got me out on deck and found in the rushing wind mighty
comfort and refreshment while Adam steadied me with his arm Let
be says I shaking off his hold Twas noughtIll go sleep
again And waiting for no more I stumbled down the quarterladder
but even as I went the haze seemed to close about me thicker than
ever and groping my way to the ships side I sank across the bulwark
and was miserably sick This agony passing I made my way below until
I reached the orlop but now feeling my sickness upon me again I crept
away into a dark corner and cast me down there And lying thus in my
misery I little by little became aware of someone weeping hard by a
desolate sobbing very pitiful to hear Insomuch that maugre my
weakness I got up and going whence this sobbing proceeded presently
came on a small huddled figure and stooping saw it was a little lad
At my step he started to his knees elbow upraised as if expecting a
blow

Why dye weep boy I questioned Whats your trouble

Nowt says he cowering away but taking him by his little thin
shoulders I lifted him into the dim light of a swinging lanthorn and
looked into a small pallid face swollen and disfigured by cuts and
bruises wrought by some brutal hand

Who did this I demanded

Nobody says he gulping a sob

Who are you

Tweendecks boy

How old are you child

At this he stared up at me out of his swollen eyes then covering his
face in ragged sleeve broke into convulsive sobbing

What now says I drawing him beside me What now

She used to call me childmy mother and here his grief choked
him Now as I looked down upon this little pitiful creature I forgot
my sickness in sudden fierce anger

Boy said I whos been flogging youspeak

Red Andy he gasped e be always a doin of it e bewish I was
dead like my mother

Jim ho Jimmy roared a voice from somewhere in the gloom forward
Jimplague seize ye show a leg will ee Here and before I
could stay him the boy started up and pattered away drying his tears
as he ran Now as I lay there I kicked off my shoes and hearkened
expectant Thus all at once I heard a murmur rising to a wail that
ended in a shrill scream and getting to my feet I crept stealthily
forward Past main and foremasts I crept past dark storerooms and
cubbyholes and so to a crack of light and clapping my eye thereto
espied two fellows rolling dice and beyond them the boy his hands
lashed miserably to a staple in the bulkhead his little body writhing
under the cruel blows of a ropesend wielded by a great redheaded
fellow

Now in my many desperate affrays with my fellowslaves those
twolegged beasts I had learned that it is the first blow that tells
wherefore groping for the latch I stealthily opened the door and or
ever the redheaded fellow was aware I was upon him from behind and
giving him no chance for defence I smote him a buffet under the ear
that tumbled him against the bulkhead whence he sank to hands and
knees Then while halfdazed he strove to rise I kicked him down
again and setting my foot upon his chest caught up the ropesend he
had dropped and beat him therewith until he roared until he groaned
and lay writhing face hid beneath his crossed arms Then whipping
out my knife I fronted his two mates the one a doleful bony man with
a squint the other a small mean blackeyed fellow in a striped shirt
who closing one bright eye leered at them with the other all at once
he nodded and pointing from the knife in my fist to the fellow
groaning beneath my foot drew a long thumb across his own stringy
throat and nodded again Hereupon I stooped above my captive and set
the flat of my blade to his forehead just below his thick red hair

Lookee dog I panted while he glared up at me beneath his bruised
arms Set so much as a finger on yon pitiful brat again and Ill cut a
mark in your gallowsface shall last your life out

His throat cullyquicks the word breathed a voice in my ear But
now as I turned and the little blackeyed fellow leapt nimbly back was
a creaking and groaning of the ladder that led to the maindeck above
and down comes a pair of prodigious stout legs and after these a round
body and last of all a great flat face small of mouth small of nose
and with a pair of little quick eyes that winked and blinked betwixt
hairless lids

The fat fellow having got him down the ladder and with wondrous ease
for one of his bulk stood winking and blinking at me the while he
patted one of his plump cheeks with plump fingers

Love my limbs says he in soft highpitched voice Perish and
plague me but whos the friend as be a ropesending o ye Andy
ladyou as be cock o the ship Here the fellow beneath my foot
essays to curse but groans instead Bless my guts says the fat
man blinking harder than ever So bad as that Andy lad Wot then
hath this fine upstanding cock o cocks thrashed all the hellfire
spirit out o ye Andy lad Love my innardsI thought no man aboard
could do as much Andy

He jumped me from behind says the fellow Andy twixt snarl and groan
and writhing under my prisoning feet

And where says the fat man smiling at me where might you ha come
from my bird o price The bosuns mate Samuel Spraggons is me
friendSam for short called likewise Smiling Samcome come never
scowl on Samnobody never quarrels with the Smiler Im friends wi
everyone I am friend

Why thenloose the child says I

Child Ha ist this little rogueling ye mean friend As he spoke
and smiling yet he caught the boys ear and wrung it twixt vicious
thumb and finger whereon I whirled the ropesend but he sprang out
of reach with wondrous agility and stood patting plump cheek and
smiling more kindly than ever the while I cut the cords that bound the
boys wrists who with an upflung wondering look at me sped away
into the orlop and was gone

Now mark ye Spraggons says I harm the child againany of yeand
Ill beat your fat carcass to a jelly

No no quoth he you cant quarrel wi me the Smiler dont never
quarrel wi none Youd never strike Smiling Sam friend

Stand still and see says I But hereupon he retreated to the ladder
and I feeling my sickness upon me again contented me by throwing the
ropesend at the fellow and stepping out backward clapped to the
door So with what speed I might I got me down into the hold and to my
doghole And here I saw I had left my lanthorn burning and found in
this light strange comfort Now being mighty athirst I reached the
demijohn from the corner and drank deep but the good water tasted ill
on my parched tongue moreover the place seemed strangely close and
airless and I in great heat wherefore I tore off my sleeved doublet
and kicking off my shoes cast myself upon my miserable bed But now
as I lay blinking at the lanthorn I was seized of sudden great dread
though of what I knew not and ever as my drowsiness increased so grew
my fear until and all at once I knew that the thing I dreaded was
Sleep and fain would I have started up but even then sleep seized
me and strive how I would my eyes closed and I fell into deep and
fearhaunted slumber



CHAPTER XVII

TELLETH HOW AN EYE WATCHED ME FROM THE DARK

It is not my intention to chronicle all those minor happenings that
befell us at this time lest my narrative prove overlong and therefore
tedious to the reader Suffice it then that the fair weather foretold
by Godby had set in and day by day we stood on with a favouring wind
Nevertheless despite calm weather and propitious gale the
disaffection among the crew waxed apace by reason of the great black
ship that dogged us some holding her to be a bloody pirate and others
a phantomship foredooming us to destruction

As to myself never was poor wretch in more woeful plight for
prisoned in the stifling hold where no ray of kindly sun might ever
penetrate and void of all human fellowship I became a prey to wild
unholy fancies and a mindsickness bred of my brooding humours my evil
thoughts seemed to take on stealthy shapes that haunted the fetid gloom
about me shapes of horror and murder conjured up of my own vengeful
imaginations An evil time indeed this of long uneasy sleepings of
hateful dreams and ill wakings of sullen humours and a horror of all
companionship insomuch that when came Godby or Adam to supply my daily
wants I would hide myself until they should be gone thereafter
tossing feverishly upon my miserable bed I would brood upon my wrongs
hugging to myself the thought of vengeance and joying in the knowledge
that every hour brought me the nearer its fulfilment

And now it was that I became possessed of an uneasy feeling that I was
not alone that beyond my crazy door was a thing softbreathing that
lurked watchfuleyed in the gloom hearkening for my smallest movement
and following on soundless feet whithersoever I went This unease so
grew upon me that when not lost in fevered sleep I would lie with
breath in check listening to such sounds as reached me above the
neverceasing groaning of the vessels labour until the squeak and
scutter of some rat hard by or any unwonted rustling beyond the door
would bring me to an elbow in sweating panic

To combat the which sick fancies it became my custom to steal up from
my fetid hidingplace at dead of night and to prowl softfooted about
the ship where none stirred save myself and the drowsy watch above
deck None the less and go where I would it seemed I was haunted
still that behind me lurked a nameless dread a silent unseen
presence Night after night I roamed the ship thus my fingers
clenched on the knife in my girdle my ears on the strain and eyes that
sought vainly every dark corner or patch of shadow

At last on a night as I crouched beside a gun on the tweendecks I
espied of a sudden a shape dim and impalpableseeming in the gloom
that flitted silently past me and up the ladder to the deck above Up
started I knife in hand but in my haste I stumbled over some obstacle
and fell but up the ladder I sprang in pursuit out into moonlight
and hastening forward came face to face with Adam

Harogue I cried and sprang at him with up lifted knife but as I
came he stepped aside incredibly quick and thrusting out a foot
tripped me sprawling

Easy shipmate easy says he thrusting a pistol under my nose
Lord love you Martin what would you now

So youll follow me will you I panted Youll creep and crawl and
spy on me will you

Neither one nor tother Martin

Twas you climbed the gangway but now

Not I Martin not I And as I scowled up at him I knew he spoke
truth and a new fear seized me

And you saw no one Adam Nothingno shape that flitted up the
ladder hitherwards and no sound to it

Never a thing Martin save yourself

Why then says I clasping my temples why thenIm mad

How so comrade

Because Im followedIm watchedspied upon sleeping and waking

Aye but how dye know he questioned stooping to peer at me

I feel itIve known it for days past and tonight I saw it Im
haunted I tell you

Who by shipmate

Aye I cried Who is itwhat Tis a thing that flits i the dark
and with never a sound that watches and listens It mounted the
ladder yonder scarce a moment since plain to my sight

Yet I saw nothing Martin And not a soul stirring save the watch
forward the steersman aft and myself

Why then Im verily mad says I

Not you shipmate not you Tis nought but the solitude and
darkness they take many a man that way so ha done with em Martin
My ladys offer of employ yet holdeth good so list with me as
masters mate say but the word and

No says I fiercely Come what may I take no service under an
accursed Brandon Saying which I got me to my feet and presently back
to the haunted dark

Thus the days dragged by all unmarked by me that took no more heed of
time for my fevered restlessness gave place to a heaviness a growing
inertia that gripped me mind and body thus when not lost in troubled
sleep I would lie motionless staring dully at the dim flame of the
lanthorn or blinking sightless on the dark

This strange sickness as hath been said I then set down to no more
than confinement and my unwholesome situation in the which supposition
I was very far beside the mark as you shall hear For there now befell
a thing that roused me from my apathy once and for all and thereby
saved me from miserably perishing and others with me and the manner of
it thus

On a time as I lay twixt sleep and wake my glance and for no reason
in the world chanced upon that knothole in the opposite bulkhead the
which as already told I had wrought into the likeness of a great eye
Now as I stared at it the thing seemed all at once to grow instinct
with life and to stare back at me I continued to view it dully
enough until little by little I became aware of something strange
about it and then as I watched this that was no more than a
knothole the thing winked at me Thinking this but some wild fancy
or a trick of the light I lay still watching it beneath my lowered
lids and thus I suddenly caught the glitter of the thing as it moved
and knew it for a very bright human eye that watched me through the
knothole Now this may seem a very small matter in the telling but
to me at that moment overwrought by my long sojourn in the dark it
was vastly otherwise

For maybe a full minute the eye stared at me fixed and motionless and
with a piercing intensity then suddenly was gone and I lying there
my flesh atingle my heart quickbeating in a strange terror so that
I marvelled to find myself so shaken Leaping up in sudden fierce anger
I wrenched open the door and rushed forth only to fall headlong over
some obstacle and lying there bruised and dazed heard the soft thud
and scamper of rats in the dark hard by So I got me back to my bunk
and lying there fell to a gloomy reflection And the more I thought
the fiercer grew my anger that any should dare so to spy upon me

Thus it was in one of my blackest humours that Godby found me when
having set down the victuals he had brought he closed the crazy door
and seated himself on the cask that served me as chair and bent to
peer at me where I lay

Martn said he speaking almost in a whisper be ye awake at last
For answer I cursed him heartily Avast pal says he shaking his
head lookee Martn tis in my mind the devils aboard this ship

And what then I demanded angrily Am I a raree show to be peeped
at and watched and spied upon

Anan palwatched dye say

Aye stared at through the knothole yonder awhile since by you or
Penfeather

Never knowed there was a knothole Martn said he in the same
hushed voice and staring at the thing and as for Capn Adam he arent
been anigh you this two days But tis all one pal all onethis
ship do be haunted And as for eyes awatching of ye Martin who
should it be but this here ghost as walketh the ship onights and makes
away wi good men

How dye mean I questioned reaching the ale he had brought What
talk is this of ghosts

Whats yon he whispered starting up as a rustling sounded beyond
the door

Mere rats man

Lord love ye Martn says he glancing about him tis a chancy
place this I dont know how ye can abide it

Ive known worse said I

Well Martn there be strange talk among the crew o something as do

Aye Ive overheard some such I nodded But look ye Ive haunted
the ship myself of late

And yet youve seen nowt o this thing pal

No What thing should I see

Who knows Martin But the sea arent the land and here on these
wild wastes o waters theres chancy things beyond any mans wisdom as
any marinerllha whats yon says he under his breath and whipping
round knife in hand Twas like a shoeless foot Martn  creeping
murder  Tis there again Speaking he tore open the door and I saw
his knife flash as he sprang into the darkness beyond as for me I
quaffed my ale Presently back he comes claps to the door mighty
careful and sinking upon the upturned cask mops at his brow

Content you Godby says I here be no ghosts

Soft ladspeak soft he whispered ForLord love you Martn
tis worse than ghosts as I do fear Dog bite me pal heres been
black and bloody doings aboard us this last two nights

How so Godby I questioned lowering my voice in turn as I met his
look

I mean lad as this thingcall it ghost or what ye willhas took
three men these last two nights Theres Perks o Deptford McLean as
hails from Leith and Treliving the Cornishmanthree good men
Martnlost vanished gone And O pal wi never a mark or trace to

Lost Dye meanoverboard

No Martn I meanlost And each of them i the middle watchthe
sleepy hour Martn just afore dawn In a fair night pal wi a calm
seathese men vanish and none to see em go And all of em prime
sailormen and trusty The which Martn sets a cove to wondering
wholl be next

But are you sure they are gone

Aye Martn weve sought em alow and aloft all over the ship save
only this hole o yournthe which you might ha known had ye slept
less

Have I slept so much then

Pal youve done little else since you came aboard seemingly All
yesterday as I do know you slept and never stirred nor took so much
as bite or supand I know because while we was a turning out the hold
aseekin and asearchin I come and took a look at ye every now and
then and heres you alyin like a dead man but for your snoring

Heres strange thing and mighty strange For until I came aboard I
was ever a wondrous light sleeper Godby

Why tis the stench o this placefaugh Come aloft and take a
mouthful o good sweet air pal

You say you sought these men everywhereeven down here in the hold

Aye alow and aloft every bulkhead and timber from trucks to keelson

And all this time I was asleep Godby

Ayelike a log Martn

And breathing heavily

Aye ye did so pal groaning ye might call itaye fit to chill a
mans good blood

And neither you nor Adam nor the others thought to search this
doghole of mine

Lord love yeno Martn How should three men hide here

Three men Aye true enough says I clasping my head to stay the
rush and hurry of my thoughts

Come aloft pal tis a fair evening and the fine folk all asupping
in the great cabin Come into the air

Yes I nodded yes twill clear my head and I must think Godby I
must think Reach me my doublet says I for now I felt myself all
shivering as with cold So Godby took up the garment where it lay and
held it out to me but all at once let it fall and drawing back stood
staring down at it and all with never a word whiles I sat crouched
upon my bed my head between my clenched fists and my mind reeling
beneath the growing horror of the thought that filled me And now
even as this thought took dreadful shape and meaningeven as suspicion
grew to certainty I heard Godby draw a gasping breath saw him reach a
stealthy fumbling hand behind him and open the door and then leaping
backwards he was swallowed in the dark and with a hurry of stumbling
feet was gone

But I scarcely heeded his going or the manner of it so stunned was I
by the sudden realisation of the terror that had haunted my ghastly
slumbers and evil wakings a terror that if my dreadful speculations
were true was very real after all a peril deadly and imminent

The truth of which I now and feverishly set myself to prove beyond
all doubt and reached for the lanthorn Now in so doing my foot
caught in the doublet lying where Godby had dropped it and I picked it
up out of the way but as I lifted it into the light I let it fall
again even as Godby had done and now staring down at it felt my
flesh suddenly acreep for as it lay there at my feet I saw upon one
sleeve a great dark stain that smeared it up from wrist to elbowthe
hideous stain of newspilt blood



CHAPTER XVIII

CONCERNING THE MARK OF A BLOODY HAND AND HOW I LAY IN THE BILBOES ON
SUSPICION OF MURDER

It was with an effort at last that I dragged my gaze from the hateful
thing at my feet only to meet the wide stare of that great eye my
knife had wrought and albeit no human eye now glittered there yet it
seemed none the less to watch my every move so persistently that I
snatched off my neckerchief and pinning it against the bulkhead with my
knife hid the thing from sight Which done I spurned my
bloodstained doublet into a corner and getting to hands and knees with
the light beside me began my search

My bunk was formed of boards supported by four upended casks and
stretched the whole length of my small chamber Upon these boards was
a pallet covered by a great blanket that hung down to the very
flooring lifting this I advanced the lanthorn and so began to examine
very narrowly this space beneath my bed And first I noticed that the
flooring hereabouts was free of dust as it had been newswept and
presently in the far corner espied a blurred mark that as I looked
took grim form and semblance stooping nearer I stared at this in the
full glare of the lanthorn then shrank back as well I might for now
I saw this mark was indeed the print of a great bloody hand open at
full stretch Crouching thus I felt again all the horror I had known
in my dreams that dread of some unseen haunting presence seeming to
breathe in the very air about me a feeling of some evil thing that
moved and crept in the dark beyond the door of ears that hearkened to
my every move and eyes that watched me unseen And this terror waxed
and grew until hearing a faint stirring behind me I whirled about in
panic to see the neckerchief gently aswing against the bulkhead where
I had pinned it and though this was caused by no more than the motion
of the ship as I judged yet in my then state of mind I whipped out
my pistol and levelling at the knothole pulled the trigger whereon
was a mere flash in the pan and no more This of itself steadied me
and sitting on my bed I found that the charge had been withdrawn

Laying by the useless weapon for I had neither powder nor ball I fell
to profound meditation And now indeed many things were plain here
methought had been the ghost here had lain the murderer of three
men here in the one and only safe place for him in the whole ship
viz beneath my bed the while I lay there in drugged sleep It would
be simple matter to steal hither in my absence and drug my food and
would explain the strange nausea had so afflicted me of late Here
then I had the secret of my daylong sleeping my vapours and black
humours here the explanation of my evil dreams and ghastly visions
while Death in human guise crept about my couch or stooped above my
unconscious form But I reasoned I was not to be murdered since I
was of more use to him alive than dead and for three reasons as I
judged First that in his stealthy comings and goings he might be
mistaken for me and thus left alone secondly that dressed in my habit
he might haply father his crimes on me and thirdly that I lying here
drugged and asleep might afford him the one and only escape from
pursuit and capture And yet thinks I what manner of man or rather
devil should this be who clad in my doublet could make away with
three lusty fellows and no one the wiser Hereupon and all in a
flash I seemed to see again the great black ship drifting down on us
in the river and the man who rowed the skiff with the misshapen bundle
in the sternsheetsthe bundle that had vanished so inexplicably

By the living God says I in a whisper heres an end to all the
mystery at last And so remained a great while sitting motionless on
my bed being mightily cast down and utterly confounded Rousing
myself at last I drew my knife from the bulkhead and put out the light
then very cautiously set wide the door and thus lapped in the pitchy
dark and mighty thankful for the good chainshirt beneath my jerkin
stood holding my breath to listen But hearing no more than the usual
stir and bustle of the ship I stole forward silent in my stockinged
feet and groping before me with my left hand the knife clenched in my
right began to steal towards the ladder And now despite shirt of
mail I felt a cold chill that crept betwixt my twitching
shoulderblades as I went for that which I feared was more hateful
than any knife

Howbeit reaching the ladder I got me to the orlop and mighty
thankful and so to the upper deck to find a wondrous fair night
breathing a sweet and balmy air and with a round moon uprising against
a great plenitude of stars The moon was low as yet and taking
advantage of the shadows I got me into the gloom of the mainmast where
the boats were stowed and here being well screened from chance view
I sat me down to drink in the glory of sea and sky and to wait for
chance of speech with Adam And huge joy was it to behold these vast
waters as they heaved to a slumberous swell and all radiant with the
moons loveliness or gazing aloft through the maze of ropes and
rigging marvelled at the glory of the heaven set with its myriad
starry fires And contrasting all this with the place of black horror
whence I had come I fell to a very ecstasy And now even as I sat
thus lost in pleasing wonderment from the quarterdeck hard by came
the sweet throbbing melody of a lute touched by skilled fingers and
therewith a voice richly soft and plaintive yet thrilling with that
strange vital ring had first arrested me and which I should have known
the world over So she sang an air that I knew not yet methought it
wondrous sweet anon she breaks off all at once and falls to the song
I had heard her sing before now viz

A poor soul sat sighing by a green willow tree

Now as I hearkened my gaze bent aloft the starry heavens grew all
sudden blurred and misty on my sight and I knew again that deep
yearning for a life far different from that I in my blind selfishness
had marked out for myself Here truly thinks I is one of Godbys
times of stars the which are good times being times of promise for
all that are blessed with eyes to seesaving only myself who though
possessing eyes am yet not as other men being indeed one set apart
and dedicated to a just act of vengeance But for this I too might
have been happy perchance and with a hope of greater happiness to be

Something the like of this was in my thoughts while the song was
asinging and I halfblinded by tears that would not be blinked away
Howbeit the song ending I was aware of a mans voice something
highpitched and precise

I vow and protest dear madam tis rarea night angelic and an angel
here to sing us to an ecstasy

Faith Joan says another voice your singing might draw any mans
heart out of him sweet cousin

And that is but bald truth I vow my lady spoke a third

Why then gentlemen says she laughing heres an angel will to bed
ere so ill a chance befall you

Now here being minded to steal a look upon her I rose and creeping
to the great mast edged myself into the shadow and so beheld one that
crouched there already and knew him for that same redheaded fellow I
had belaboured with the ropesend He was staring up at the
quarterdeck and following his look I saw my lady stand leaning upon
the rail her shapely figure outlined against the moonlight her face
upraised to the sky So stood she awhile the gentlemen beside her
very brave in their velvets and newfangled great periwigs until came
her maid Marjorie then she sighed acknowledged the gentlemens bows
and flourishes with a graceful curtesy and bidding them a laughing
goodnight went her way her shapely arm about Marjories trim waist
Hereupon the redheaded fellow uttered a sound twixt a sigh and groan
and beholding him now as he yet stared after her I saw his face
convulse and a look in his eyes as he tongued his lips as made my very
gorge rise and I crept a pace nearer

Be that you Smiler says he his gaze still fixed O mate yons a
rare dainty bita sweet armful Smiler

Dog I cried in sudden choking fury At this he leapt back hardly
escaping my fist

Haist you again cries he and with the words sprang at me and
fetched me a staggering buffet in the mouth At this forgetting all
prudence I closed with him and heedless of his blows secured the
wrestling grip I sought and wrenching him down and across my knee saw
his face suddenly besplashed with the blood from my cut mouth the
while I strove to choke him to silence But he struggled mightily and
thrice he cried murder in despite of me whereupon the cry was taken
up by one here and others there until the very ship seemed to roar
murder

Followed a rush of feet a confusion of voices all about me and
loosing my adversary I reeled back to the mast under a rain of blows

Stand awayback all cried a voice Gie mea shot at the rogue
and the muzzle of a caliver was thrust into my face only to be dashed
aside as Adam sprang before me

Hold off says he whereupon they shrank back from me one and all
before his levelled pistol and there came a moments silence wherein I
heard Godby utter a gasp and letting fall the caliver he stared at me
agape Heres no murderer ye fools says Adam scowling round on
them Tis no more thanha way for Sir Rupertmake way for the
Captain there

Pray whats to do Master Penfeather demanded Sir Rupert hasting
forward with drawn sword and the three gentlemen behind him Whats
all this riot

Nought but a stowaway rogue Sir Rupert and one beknown to me in
England

Ha says Sir Rupert stroking a curl of his great peruke How cometh
he brawling with the watch

Lookee my masters cried the redheaded fellow gasping and making
great todo of gurgling and clasping his throat where I had squeezed
him lookee sirs at my bloody faceall bloodied I be and nigh done
for by yon murdering rogue Heres me on my watch and no thought o
harm and suddenly out o nowhere he takes him and grips me from behind
and would ha murdered me as he murdered tothers

Ha cried Sir Rupert The man reeks blood observe Master
Penfeather and heres grave charge beside

Now as I leaned there against the mast I saw a figure flit down the
quarterladder and fain would have fled yet seeing this vain hung my
head and cowered in a very agony of mortified pride

And you know this man you say Master Adam questioned Sir Rupert

Aye I do sir for a desperate fellow and so doth my Lady
Brandonand yourself also

Ha Bring him forward where I may get look of him The which being
done Sir Rupert starts back with swordpoint raised

By heaven he cried How cometh this fellow aboard

A stowaway as I said sir quoth Adam You mind him very well it
seemeth

Aye verily says Sir Rupert tapping me lightly with his sword as I
stood between my captors Hayoure the rogue stood i the pillory

Aye I nodded scowling at his dainty person And youre the one
that set me there

Tis a rogue ingrain said Sir Rupert frowning in turn O a very
desperate fellow as you say Master Adam and like enough the murderer
we are aseeking Hereupon I laughed and was kicked unseen therefor
by Adam

My lady says he turning where she stood hard by You have seen
this fellow I think

Yes says she readily And indeed Cousin Rupert I know more of
thisof him than you do and very sure am I he is no murderernor
ever will be Here for a moment her glance rested on me and meeting
that look I forgot my wounded vanity and degradation awhile

Sweet my lady says Sir Rupert Your gentle womans heart may not
brook scenes the like of this Go seek thy tender pillow and leave
such to us of sterner mould

Nay cousin my gentle womans heart knoweth innocence from guilt
methinks and here standeth innocent man stowaway though he be

Why then as stowaway will I entreat him fair cousin Master
Penfeather clap him in irons till the morning away with himnay I
myself will see him safely lodged Here and without further parley
I was led below watched by the whole ships company and so to a
dismal place abaft the lazarette where the armourer Master Taffery
duly locked me into the manacles arm and leg beneath the eyes of
Penfeather and Sir Rupert who seeing me this secure presently left me
to darkness and my solitary reflections

Howbeit after some while I heard the sound of key turning and Adam
reentered bearing a light having locked the door on us he set down
the lanthorn on the floor and seating himself on the bench whereto I
was shackled falls into a passion of cursing both in English Spanish
and Indian for aught I know for never had I heard the like words or
such deep fervour

Adam says I he being at a pause tis hard to think you were ever
a student of divinity

Hereupon he glances at me from the corners of his eyes and shakes his
head

Your face is bloody Martin are ye hurt

My bellys empty Adam

Why I guessed as much shipmate Godbys bringing ye the wherewithal
to fill it In the meantime Ill free you o your bilboes awhile
though I must lock you up again that you may be found snug and secure
in the morning So saying he took a key from his pocket and therewith
set me at liberty

Ah Martin quoth he as I stretched myself why must ye go
araising of tumults above deck under our very noses Heres mighty
ill plight youve got yourself into and heres me awondering how I am
to get ye out again Heres been murder done and lookee this
coxcombly captain hath got it into his skull that youre the
murdereraye and whats worse every soul aboard likewise save only
Godby and myself

And my lady says I

True shipmate true She spoke for ye as I guessed she might

And how should you guess this Adam

By adding one and one Martin But even so comrade even though she
stand by youwhat can she do or Godby and I for that matter gainst
a whole ships company crazed wi panic fearfear aye and small
wonder Martin Death is bad enough murders worse but for three
hearty fellows to disappear and leave no trace

Aye but was there no trace Adam

None shipmate none

No blood anywhere

Never a spot shipmate

Why then is there ever a man aboard with a wounded hand Adam

Not one to my knowing and Ive turned up the crew on deck twice these
last two daysevery man and boy but saw not so much as cut finger or
stained garment among emand Ive sharp eyes Martin But why dye
ask

Because the man who made away with these three fellows was wounded in
the hand Adamhowbeit that hand was bloody

Hand shipmate says Penfeather softly would it be a right
handha

It was I nodded The mark of a great right hand

Aye aye says Adam pinching his chin A right hand Martin And
where was the mark dye say

Beneath my bed

Bed Martinyour bed Here he caught his breath and rose up and
stood looking down at me betwixt narrowed lids and apinching at his
square chin

Ayethere Adam the only place in the ship you never thought to
searchthere he lay safe hid and I above him in a drugged sleep

Drugged says Adam betwixt shut teeth Aye  drugged  crass
fool it was not to ha guessed it ere this And now he falls silent
and stands very still only his sinewy fingers pinched and pinched at
his chin as he stared blindly down at the floor So now I told him of
my fevered dreams and black imaginations of my growing fears and
suspicions of the eye had watched me through the knothole and of the
man on the river with the boat wherein was the great misshapen bundle
which had vanished just after the black ship ran foul of us

Lord says Adam at last So the mystery is resolved The matter
lies plain as a pikestaff Ha Martin weve shipped the devil aboard
it seems

Who weareth a steel hook Adam

And yet Martin and yet says he looking at me from the corners of
his eyes herein if we seek far enough we may find the hand of
Providence I think

How says I Providence dye call it

Aye Martinif we do but seek far enough Here he turned in answer
to a furtive rapping and opening the door I heard Godbys voice
Come in man come in says Adam heres only Martin

Aye quoth I heartily come in Godbehere Jenkins that was my
friend At this in he comes unwillingly enough and with never so much
as a glance in my direction

Heres the wittles Capn says he and setting down the food and
drink he had brought turned away

What Godby ha ye no word for a poor murderer in his abasement
says I Whereat he shakes his head mighty gloomy and keeping his gaze
averted As for Adam he stood pinching his chin the while his quick
bright eyes darted from one to other of us

How are ye going and never a word quoth I as Godby crossed to the
door

Aye I am says he with gaze still averted

Why you left me in mighty hurry last time Godby

Aye I did says he

Why then tell us whereforespeak out man

Not I Martin not I says he and touching his bonnet to Penfeather
hasted away

Ha says Adam closing and locking the door And whats the riddle
Martin

My doublet Godby chancing to take it up finds it all asmear with
blood and incontinent suspects me for this black murderer which comes
hard since heres an end of Godbys faith and my friendship

Why look now Martin his suspicions are in reason seeing that what
with drugs deviltries and what not youve been mighty strange o late
and more unlovely company than usual dye see

Howbeit says I scowling and reaching for the food Heres an end
to my friendship for Godby Now as to youwhat dyou say

I think shipmate that your doublet bloody and you the grimly
desperate gallowsy hellfire rogue you strive so hard to appear
Martin I say heres enough to hang you ten times over One thing is
sure you must leave this ship

Not I Adam

The longboats astern victualled and ready

No matter says I

Twill be no hard matter to get you safe away Martin

Howbeit I stay here says I mighty determined Im no murderer

But youre a man to hang and hanged youll be and you can lay to that
dye see

So be it says I

Very fine shipmate but as I was saying the longboat is towing
astern a good boat and well stored The moon will be down in an
hour

And what of it I demanded

Twill be easy for you to slip down from the stern gallery

Never in the world quoth I

And as luck will have it Martin Bartlemys Islandour islandlieth
scarce eighty miles southwesterly Being thither you shall come on
our treasure by the aid of the chart I shall give you and leaving the
gold take only the four coffers of jewels

You waste your breath Adam

Then shipmate with these jewels aboard you shall stand away for
another island that beareth south a days sail

Look you Adam says I clenching my fists once and for all I do
not leave this ship happen what may

Aye but you will shipmate

Ha dye think to force me then

Not I Martin but circumstances shall

What circumstances

Here and all at once Adam started up as again there came a soft
knocking at the door Whos there he cried And then in my ear
Tis she Martin as I guess though sooner than I had expectedinto
the bilboes with you Thus whispering and with action incredibly
quick he clapped and locked me back in my shackles whisked food
platter and bottle into a dark corner and crossed to the door Whos
there he demanded gruffly Ensued a murmur whereupon he turned the
key set wide the door and fell back bowing bonnet in hand all in a
moment

Good Master Adam says she gently Pray you leave us awhile and let
none intrude on us At this Adam bows again very low with a whimsical
glance at me and goes out closing the door behind him



CHAPTER XIX

CONCERNING THE PRINCESS DAMARIS

For a while she stood looking down on me and I meeting that look
glanced otherwhere yet conscious of her regard stirred uneasily so
that my irons rattled dismally

Sir says she at last but there I stayed her

Madam once and for all I am no sir

Martin Conisby she amended in the same gentle voice Master
Penfeather telleth you refused the honourable service I offeredI pray
you wherefore

Because Ive no mind to serve a Brandon

Yet you steal aboard my ship Master Conisby you eat the food my
money hath paid for Doth this suffice your foolish stubborn pride
Here finding nought to say I scowled at my fetters and held my peace
whereat she sighed a little as I had been some fretful peevish child
Why are you here in my ship she questioned patiently Was it for
vengeance Tell me she demanded is it that you came yet seeking
your wicked vengeance

Mine is a just vengeance

Vengeance howsoever just is Godsleave it unto God At this I
was silent again whereupon she continued her voice more soft and
pleading Even though my father had  indeed  wronged you and
yours  how shall his death profit you

Ha I cried staring up at her troubled face Can it be you know
this for very truth at last Are you satisfied of my wrongs and know
my vengeance just Have ye proof of Sir Richards black
treacheryconfess Now at this her eyes quailed before my look and
she shrank away

God forgive him she whispered bowing stately head

Speak says I fiercely Have ye the truth of it at last

Tis that bringeth me here to you Martin Conisby to confess this
wrong on his behalf and on his behalf to offer such reparation as I
may Alas for the bodily sufferings you did endure we can never
atone but  in all other ways

Never says I scowling What is doneis done and I amwhat I
am But for yourself his sin toucheth you no whit

How cried she passionately Am I not his fleshhis blood Twas
but lately I learned the truth from his secret papers  and  O
twas all there  even the price he paid to have you carried to the
plantations So am I come pleading your forgiveness for him and for me
 to humble myself before you  see thus  thus upon my knees

Now beholding all the warm beauty of her as she knelt humbly before me
the surge and tumult of her bosom the quiver of her red lips the
tearful light of her eyes I was moved beyond speech and ever she
knelt there bowed and shaken in her mute abasement

My Lady Joan said I at last for your pure self I can have nought
to forgiveIthat am all unworthy to touch the latchet of your shoe
 Rise I pray

And formy father she whispered Alas my poor miserable father

Speak not of him I cried Needs must there be hate and enmity
betwixt us until the end So was silence awhile nor did I look up
dreading to see her grief

Your face is cut Martin said she at last very softly Suffer that
I bathe it Now turning in amaze I saw her yet upon her knees
looking up at me despite her falling tears Wilt suffer me to bathe
it Martin says she her voice unshaken by any sob I shook my head
but rising she crossed to the door and came back bearing a small
pannikin of water I brought this for the purpose says she

Nay indeed II am well enough

Then I will make you better

No says I angrily

Yes says she patiently but setting dimpled chin at me

And wherefore madam

Because Im so minded sir So saying she knelt close beside me and
fell abathing my bruised face as she would and I helpless to stay
her yet marvelling within me at the gentle touch of her soft hands and
the tender pity in her tearwet eyes Martin says she as I do thus
cherish your hurts you shall one day mayhap cherish your enemys

Never says I You can know me not at all to think so

I know you better than you guess Martin You think it strange belike
and unmaidenly in me that I should seek you thus that your name should
come so readily to my lip But I have remembered the name Martin for
the sake of a boy long years since who found a little maid she was
just ten year old found her lost and wandering in a wood very woeful
and frightened and forlorn And this boy seemed very big and strong
he was just eleven he said and was armed with a bow and arrows to
shoot outlaws And yet he was very gentle and kindly laying by his
weapons the better to comfort her sorrows and dry her tears So he
brought her to a cave he called his castle and showed her a real
sword he kept hidden there albeit a very rusty one and said he would
be her knight to do great things for her some day Then he brought her
safely home and he told her his name was Martin and she said hers was
Damaris

Damaris said I starting

Often after this they used to meet by a corner of the old park wall
where he had made a place to go up and down byfor six months I
think they played together daily and once he fought a great rough
boy on her behalf and when the boy had run away she bathed her
champions hurts in a little brookbathed them with her scarf as thus
I do yours At last she was sent away to a school and the years
passed but she never forgot the name of Martin though he forgot her
quite  but  you  you remember now MartinO you remember
now says she with a great sob

Aye I remember now quoth I hoarsely

It is for the sake of this boy Martin so brave so strong yet so
very gentle and kindlyfor him and all he might have been that I pray
you forego your vengeanceI beseech you to here renounce it

Never I cried clenching my shackled hands But for my enemy this
boy might now be as other menstead of outcast rogue and scarred
galleyslave he might have come to love and win loveto have known
the joy of life and its fulness Howbeit he must go his way rogue and
outcast to the end

No she cried No The wrong may be undonemustshall bewounds
will heal and even scars will fade with time

Scars of the body ayebelike said I But there be scars of the
mind wounds of the soul shall never healso shall my just vengeance
sleep not nor die whiles I have life

Here for awhile she was silent again and I saw a tear fall sparkling

And yet said she at last and never stirring from her humble posture
and yet I have faith in you still for despite all your cruel wrongs
and grievous suffering you are soyoung headstrong and wilful and
very desolate and forlorn Thus whiles I have life my faith in you
shall sleep not nor die yet greatly do I pity

Pity says I fiercely You were wiser to hate and see me hanged out
of hand

Poor soul she sighed and rising laid one white hand upon my
shackled fist And yet mayhap you shall one day find again your sweet
and longlost youthmeanwhile strive to be worthy a sorrowing maids
honest pity

Pity says I again Tis akin to loveso give me hate tis thing
most natural twixt your blood and mine

Poor soul she repeated viewing me with her great calm eyes albeit
their lashes were wet with tears How may I hate one so wretched
Here seeing mayhap how the words stung me she must needs repeat them
Poor wretched soul thourt farfar beneath my hate

Belike youll come to learn in time says I beside myself At this
I saw the white hand clench itself but her voice was tender as ever
when she answered

Sorrow and suffering may lift a man to greatness if he be strong of
soul or debase him to the brute if he be weak

Why then says I begone to your gallants and leave me to the
brutes

Nay first will I do that which brought me and she showed the key of
my gyves

Let be I cried I seek no freedom at your handslet be I say

As you will says she gently So endeth my hope of righting a
great wrong I have humbled myself to you tonight Martin Conisby I
have begged and prayed you to forego your vengeance to forgive the
evil done not so much for my fathers sake as for your own and this
because of the boy I dreamed a man ennobled by his sufferings and one
great enough to forgive past wrongs since by forgiveness cometh
regeneration Here ends my dreamalas you are but rogue and
galleyslave after all So shall I ever pity you greatly and greatly
despise you

Then she turned slowly away and went from me closing and locking the
door and left me once more in the black dark but now full of yet
blacker thoughts

To be scorned by her And shea Brandon

And now I miserable wretch that I was giving no thought to the
possibility of my so speedy dissolution raged in my bonds wasting
myself in futile imprecations against this woman who as it seemed to
me in my blind and brutish anger had but come to triumph over me in my
abasement Thus of my wounded selflove did I make me a whip of
scorpions whereby I knew an agony beyond expression



CHAPTER XX

HOW I CAME OUT OF MY BONDS AND OF THE TERRORS OF A FIRE AT SEA

The Devil ever zealous for the undoing of poor Humanity surely
findeth no readier ally than the blind and merciless Spirit of
Mortified Pride Thus I minding the Lady Joans scornful look and the
sting of her softspoke words fell to black and raging fury and vowed
that since rogue and galleyslave she had named me rogue she should
find me in very truth henceforward if I might but escape my perilous
situation

And now it was that Chance or Fate or the Devil sent me a means whereby
I might put this desperate and most unworthy resolution into practice
for scarce had I uttered this vow when a key turned softly in the lock
the door opened and closed stealthily and though I could not see it
being pitchdark I knew that someone stood within a yard of me and
all with scarce a sound and never a word And when this silence had
endured a while I spoke sudden and harsh

What now Is it the noose so soon or a knife sooner

I heard a quickdrawn breath a soft footfall and a small hand
groping in the dark touched my cheek and crept thence to my helpless
manacled fist Who is it I demanded blenching from the touch Who
is it Speak

Hush whispered a voice in my ear It be only me master
Jimmylittle Jim as you was good to Red Andy dont beat me no more
he be afeared o you Good to me you was master an sos shetook
me to be her page she ave

Whom dyou mean boy

I mean Her Her wi the beautiful kind eyes an little feet Her as
sings Her they calls my lady Her Good t me she isan sos
you so I be come to ye master

Hadid she send you

No I just come to save you from being hung tomorrow like they says
you must

And how shall you do this boy

First wi this key master

Stay Did she give you this key

No masterI took it So albeit twas very dark the boy very soon
had freed me of my shackles which done and all aquiver with haste
he seizes my hand and tugs at it

Come master he whispered This waythis way So with his
little rough hand in mine I suffered him to bring me whither he would
in the dimness for not a lanthorn burned anywhere until at last he
halted me at a ladder propped against a bulkhead and mounting before
bade me follow Up I climbed forthwith and so to a narrow trap or
scuttle through which I clambered with no little todo and found
myself in a strange place the roof so low I could barely sit upright
and so strait that I might barely lie outstretched

Lie you here master he whispers And for the love o God dont
speak nor make a sound Saying which he got him back through the
scuttle closing the trap after him and I heard the clatter of the
ladder as he removed it

Hereupon lying snug in my hidingplace I presently became aware of a
sweetness that breathed upon the air a fragrance very faint but vastly
pleasing and fell awondering what this should be My speculations
were banished by the opening of a door near by and a light appeared by
which I saw myself lying in a narrow space shut off by a valance or
curtain that yet showed a strip of carpet beyond and all at once upon
this carpet came a little buckled shoe I was yet staring on this in
dumb amaze when a voice spoke softly

Are you there Martin Conisby Hush speak low I do command you

For answer I dragged myself into the light and stared up at the Lady
Joan Brandon

Where am I I demanded

In my cabin says she meeting my scowl with eyes serene and all
untroubled I had you brought hither to save you

To save me Ha youyou to save me

Because you are not man enough to die yet she went on in her calm
grave voice so I will save you alive that haply you may grow more
worthy

So twas by your orders The boy lied then says I choking with my
anger Twas you gave him the key Twas you bade him bring me
hither

Where none shall dare seek you says she all unmoved by my bitter
rage So do I give you life Martin Conisby praying God you may find
your manhood one day

Life quoth I getting to my feet My life at your hands Now look
ye madam rather will I hang unjustly rather will I endure again the
shame of the lashaye by Gods light rather will I rot in chains or
perish of plague than take my life at your hands So now madam Ill
out of this perfumed nest and hang if I must saying which I turned to
the door but she checked me with a gesture

Stay she commanded Would you shame me And now though she
fronted me with proud head erect I saw her cheek flush painfully

Aye verily quoth I A ladys honour is delicate ware and not to be
cheapened by such poor rogue as I Fear nothing lady I will go as
I stopped all at once as came footsteps without and a light tapping on
the door

Who is it she called lightly enough and shot the bolt with nimble
fingers

Only I sweet coz answered a gay voice And I come but to warn you
not to venture on deck tomorrow till justice hath been done upon our
prisoner

Shall youhang him Rupert

Assuredly Tis a black rogue and merits a worse fate

Is he then tried and condemned already Rupert

Nay though twill be soon done We have come on such evidence of his
guilt as doth condemn him out of hand

What evidence cousin

His doublet all besmirched with his victims blood The man is a very
devil and must hang at dawn So Joan stir not abroad in the morning
until I come to fetch you A fair good night sweet coz and sweet
dreams attend thee And away trips Sir Rupert and leaves us staring
on one another she proud and gracious in all her dainty finery and I a
very hangdog fellow my worn garments smirched by the grime of my many
hidingplaces

Was this indeed your doublet she questioned at last

It was

How came it stained with blood For answer I shrugged my shoulders
and turned away Have you nothing to say

Nothing madam

You would have me think you this murderer

I would have you think of me none at all I answered and smiled to
see how I had stirred her anger at last

Nay sighs she needs must I think of you as the poor mean thing
you are and pity you accordingly

Howbeit says I scowling blacker than ever I will get me out of
your sight

Aye but the ladder is gone

No matter says I better a broken neck tonight than a noose
tomorrow Tomorrow aye the dawn is like to see an end of the feud
and the Conisbys both together

And so shameful an end says she At this I turned my back on her
for anger was very strong in me So nothing speaking I got to my
knees that I might come at the trap beneath her berth but next moment
I was on my feet glaring round for some weapon to my defence for on
the air was sudden wild tumult and hubbub a running of feet and
confused shouting that waxed ever louder Then as I listened I knew
it was not me they hunted for now was the shrill braying of a trumpet
and the loud throbbing of a drum

MartinO Martin Conisby She stood with hands clasped and eyes wide
in a dreadful expectancy What is it she panted O what is it
Harkwhat do they cry

Rigid and motionless we stood to listen then every other emotion was
whelmed and lost in sudden paralysing fear as above the trampling
rush of feet above the shrill blast of tucket and rolling of drum we
caught the awful word Fire

Now God help us all cries she wringing her hands then sinking to
her knees she leaned halfswooning against the door yet I saw her
pallid lips moving in passionate supplication

As for me my first panic over I sat me on her bed revolving how I
might turn the general confusion to the preservation of my life In
this I was suddenly aroused by my ladys hand on my bowed shoulder

Hark cries she Hark where they cry for aid

Why so they do says I And so they may

Then come let us out You are a strong man you will help to save
the ship

And hang thereafter Not I madam

Will you do nothing cried she clenching her hands

Verily madam I shall do my earnest endeavour to preserve this poor
rogues body o mine from noose and flame But as for the shiplet it
burn say I

Spoke like a very coward says she in bitter scorn And a coward is
selfish always So saying she crossed to the door and reached her
hand to the bolt but in a leap I was beside her and caught this hand
prisoning it there

Harkee madam quoth I You tell me that to hang is a shameful
death and the noose as good as round my neck But before God madam
Ill see this ship go up in flame and perish with it ere that noose
shall strangle the life out of me and my wrongs unavenged So the ship
may burn an it will Meantime do you seek your salvation and leave me
to seek mine Then opening the door I stood aside to give her way
instead she stood a moment looking on me greateyed

O blind says she at last To treasure life for your wicked
vengeance O blind blind Then and very suddenly she sped out and
away

Left alone I stood hearkening to the distant uproar and casting about
in my mind how best I might contrive my preservation And now in my
desperate need it seemed there was but one hope for me and this but
slender viz to steal myself up to Adams lodgment under the poop and
that as soon as might be To this end I stepped forth of the cabin and
so into a narrow passageway with divers doors to right and left that
opened upon other cabins in one of which I espied a cloak and
feathered hat lying where their owner had dropped them whipping the
cloak about me I clapped on the hat and staying for no more hasted on
breathing an air acrid with drifting smoke Reaching a broad stairway
I climbed at speed and found myself out upon the lofty poop whence I
might look down on the decks through a haze of smoke that poured up
through the after hatchway mounting in billowy wreaths against the
splendour of the moon Here it seemed was gathered the whole ships
company with mighty stir and todo and none with eyes to spare for me
Howbeit I stayed for no second glance but running to Adams cabin
found the door unlocked the which I closed and bolted after me in the
doing of which I noticed to my comfort that this door was mighty
thick and strong and in it moreover a loophole newly cut with others
in the bulkheads to right and left and all very neatly plugged from
within and what with this and the musquetoons that stood in racks very
orderly the place small though it was had all the virtues of a fort
or citadel Here then so far as might be I was safe whatever
chanced since I had but to lift the trap in the floor and descend into
the roundhouse below whence I might gain the sterngallery and so the
sea itself And now laying by the hat and cloak I cast myself on
Adams bed and there outstretched in great content hearkened to the
distant voices and tramp of feet where they laboured to put out the
fire

Little by little these sounds became merged with the droning of the
wind and the neverceasing surge and hiss of the seas lulled by this
and the sense of my comparative safety I presently fell aslumbering
And sleeping thus dreamed myself young again and playing with the
child Damaris thrilling to the clasp of her little childish hands
joying in the tones of her clear sweet child voiceshe that grown up
I knew for none other than Joan Brandon



CHAPTER XXI

TELLETH HOW THE SAID FIRE CAME ABOUT

Lord love me shipmate heres you to hang at peep o day and
asmiling in your dreams

WhatAdam says I sitting up

In few short hours Martin here will be ninety odd souls earnestly
seeking to swing you up to the mainyard and you aslumbering sweet as
any innocent babe and burn me shipmate I love you the better fort

What of the fire Adam

Why twas an excellent fire Martin and smoked bravely Whats more
it served its divers purposes whiles it lasted

Is it out then Adam

This two hours

And what might you mean by its purposes

Well mayhap you were one o them Martin Heres the second time
fire hath served ye well youll mind

How I cried starting to my feet Will you be telling me twas you
set this fire going

As to the other purpose shipmate tis yonderhark to it And
smiling grimly Adam held up a sinewy finger as from somewhere
forward rose a confused and dismal wailing

In heavens name whats toward now Adam

The crew are singing Martin likewise they dance presently they
shall fall aquarrelling then grow potvaliant all in regular and
accepted order Already one poor rogue hath been aft to demand the
women of us dye see and

To demand the women says I in gasping astonishment

Aye the women Martinmy Lady Joan and her maid dye see

Gods love Adam I cried gripping his arm And youwhat said you
to the vile dog

Nought I shot him

Is the mutiny broke out then

Not yet shipmate but tis coming aye tis coming which is very
well

And what hath brought things to this pass

Rum Martin The fire was in the storeroom where there is rum
aplenty dye see and what was to prevent the rogues making off with
a keg or so that chanced to lie handynot I shipmate not I

And why not in the Devils name

Because Martin says Adam sitting at the table and beginning to set
his papers in order because theres nought like liquor for putting
the devil into a man and of all liquor commend me to rum with a dash
o tobacco or gunpowder dye see We shall be heaving dead men
overboard ere dawn I judge and all along of this same rum Martin
Black mutiny murder and sudden death shipmate and mores the pity
say I But if Providence seeth fit why so be it

Providence quoth I scowling down into his impassive face Dare ye
talk of Providence Twas you set this bloody business afoot

Aye Martin it was says he nodding As to Providencelookee
now if you can ape Providence to your own ends which is vengeance and
bloody murder I can do as much for mine which is to save the lives of
such as stand true to me and the shipnot to mention the women
Theres Tressady skulking below and I have but contrived that the
mutiny should come in my time rather than his and theirs As it is we
are prepared fifteen stout lads lie in the roundhouse below with
musquetoon and fusee and every gun and swivel that will bear falconet
and paterero aimed to sweep the waist when they rush as rush they
will Martin when the drink hath maddened em properly

And having maddened them with your hellish decoctions youll shoot the
poor rogues down

Aye Martin I will so lest peradventure they shoot me Then
besides shipmate what o the women I have the Lady Joan and her
maid to think on twould be an ill fate theirs in the hands of yon
filthy rabblement Hark to em yonder hark what they sing

For a while I could hear nought but a clamour of fierce shouts and
hallooing then little by little this wild hoarse tumult rose and
swelled to a fierce chaunt

 Some swam in rum to kingdom come
 Full many a lusty fellow
 And since theyre sped all stark and dead
 Theyre flaming now in hell O
 So cheerly O
 Hey cheerly O
 Theyre burning down in hell O


Dye hear it Martin did ye hear it Shoot the poor rogues dye say
Sink me but I will so if Fortune be so kind Yonders short shrift and
quick dispatch for me shipmate and thenthe women Think of my Lady
Joan writhing in their clutches Harkee to the lewd roguestis
women nowhark to em And here again their vile song burst forth
with much the same obscenity as I had once heard sung by Abnegation
Mings in a wood and the which I will not here transcribe

Well shipmate says Adam glancing up from his papers last of all
theres yourself Heres you with the rope in prospect unless you quit
this ship and yonder Martin yonder is the longboat towing astern
all stored ready a calm sea and a fair wind

No more of that says I angrily

But will ye dangle in a noose Martin when you might be away in the
longboat as tows astern of us and with a fair wind as I say and

Have done says I clenching my fists

Twill be the simplest thing in the world Martin he went on
leaning back in his chair and nodding up at me mighty pleasant aye a
very simple matter for you to drop down from the sterngallery yonder
dye see and setting a course southwesterly you should make our
island in fourandtwenty hours or less what with this wind and the sea
so calm

Never cried I in growing fury Come what will I stay aboard this
ship until we reach our destination

Hum says he pinching his chin and eyeing me twixt narrowed lids
Are ye still bent on nought but vengeance then Why lookee Martin
tis none so far to seek for seeing you may not reach the father why
not smite him through the daughter Shed make fine sport for our
beastly crewhark to em roaring Sport for them and a mighty full
vengeance for you

The table betwixt us hampered my blow and then as I strove to come at
him I brought up with the muzzle of his pistol within a foot of my
brow

Easy shipmate easy says he leaning back in his chair but keeping
me covered

Damned rogue I panted

True he nodded True Martin vengeance is kin to roguery dye
see If youre for murdering the father whats to hinder you from
giving the proud daughter up tosteady Martin steady it is Your
sudden ways be apt to startle a timid man and my fingers on the
trigger Lookee now shipmate if your scheme of finegentlemanly
vengeance doth not permit of such methods towards a woman whats to
prevent you going on another track and carrying her with you safe from
all chance of brutality Theres stowage for her in the longboat
which is a stout roomy craft now towing astern stored and victualled
a smooth sea a fair wind

Harkee Adam Penfeather says I choking with passion once and for
all I bide on this ship until she brings up off Hispaniola

But then Martin she never will bring up off Hispaniola not whiles I
navigate her

Ha I cried Doth my lady know of this Doth Sir Rupert

Not yet Martin

Then by Heaven they shall learn this very hour

I think not Martin

And I swear they shall Let them hang me an they will but first they
shall hear you intend to seize the ship to your own purposesaye by
God they shall know you for the pirate you are

Now as I turned and strode for the door I heard the sudden scrape of
Adams chair behind me and whirling about saw his pistol aswing
above my head felt the vicious staggering blow and reeling to the
door sank weakly to my knees and thence seemed to plunge into a black
immensity and knew no more



CHAPTER XXII

TELLETH HOW WE WERE CAST ADRIFT

I awoke to a wind on my brow very pleasant and sweet and in my ears
the soft and drowsy ripple of water right soothing to hear and thus
would have slumbered on but for another sound that broke out at
intervals a thunderous roar that seemed to shake me where I lay
Therefore I opened my eyes to see above me a great multitude of stars
and lay staring up at them in vague and dreamy wonderment until roused
again by another thunderclap I raised myself and saw I lay in the
sternsheets of a large open boat that rocked to a gentle swell and
all about me a misty sea grey with the dawn Now as I gazed around me
greatly troubled and amazed I beheld far away across these dim
waters a flash of red flame and after some while heard again the
thunder of a gun

Little by little as the light waxed I made out the loom of two ships
and despite the distance I knew the foremost for the Faithful
Friend Ever and anon would come the faint crack of caliver or
petronel from her high poop and the thunder of her sternchase guns
And with my minds eyes I seemed to espy Adam firing from his loopholes
to sweep the decks forward the while Godby and his few gunners served
the great basilisks aft aiming them at a tall black ship that stood
hard in their wake yawing now and then to bring her forechase to bear
on them in answer

Suddenly up flamed the sun turning sea and sky to glory but I crouched
miserable in my helplessness for now I saw the Faithful Friend
steered a course that was taking her rapidly away from me upon the
freshening wind Perceiving which bitter truth beholding myself thus
befooled bubbled and tricked and my head throbbing from the blow of
Penfeathers pistolbutt a mighty anger against him surged within me
and shaking my fists I fell to fierce curses and revilings like any
madman until what with my aching head and lack of breath I cast
myself face down and lay there spent with my futile ravings Yet even
so bethinking me of all my fine schemes and purposes thus brought to
nothingness and myself drifting impotent at the mercy of wind and wave
I sought to spit my puny anger against the God that made me in
blasphemies and bitter imprecations

O shame shame on you Martin Conisby The God you rail upon is my
God also Have done I say Be silent nor tempt His mercy with your
childish clamours

Upstarting I turned and beheld the Lady Brandon upon her knees within
a yard of me saw her shrink before my gaze and the griping passion of
my hands for now reading in her look all her scorn and loathing for
the thing I was I must needs turn my fury upon her and did that the
which shames me to this day for even as she fronted me all
defenceless but with head erect and eyes unflinching despite the sick
pallor of her cheeks I seized her in cruel hold and dragging her to
me bent her backward across a thwart

Ha I gasped Will ye dare cry shame on me Will ye mockwill ye
floutwill ye scorn me stilland you but a lying thieving Brandon
Would you trample me neath your proud feet

All this says she staring up into my eyes But I do pity you most
forwhat you are become Okill me if you will twould be very easy
for you and mayhap best for me and I do not fear to die So do as
you will Martin Conisby I do not fear you since Death is my kind
friend and shall free me of the shame of you if need be

Hereupon I loosed her and crouched again in the sternsheets bowed my
head upon my fists whiles she kneeling patiently beside the midship
thwart ordered her wrenched garments with shaking hands

And after some while her voice with its sweet vital ring pierced to
those black deeps where lay the soul of me

Tis growing very rough What must we do

Lifting my head I saw that the sea was risen considerably and the
boat drifting broadside to the wind so that the waves taking us
abeam spilled aboard us ever and anon So I arose and made shift to
step the mast and hoist sail nothing heeding her proffered aid then
shipping the tiller I put our little vessel before the wind And now
from a log pitching and rolling at mercy of the waves this boat
became as it were alive and purposeful lifting to the seas with
joyous motion shaking the water from her bows in flashing brine that
sparkled jewellike in the early sun her every timber thrilling to the
buffets of the waters that rushed bubbling astern all rainbowhued and
with a sound like elfin laughter until what with all this and the
strong sweet air even I felt the joy of it but though my black
humour lifted somewhat my shame was sore upon me wherefore I kept my
gaze for the peak of the sail the cloudless heaven the deep blue of
the seas and never so much as glanced at the patient solitary figure
amidships

Whither do we sail she questioned at last

What matter says I sullenly

Aye true she sighed

Besides I have no compass

There is one in the locker here and with it a packet and a letter
writ to you Shall I bring them

As you will says I keeping my gaze averted So she makes her way
over to me and mighty dexterous despite the motion of the boat and
setting the compass beside me gives me the letter It was sealed and
subscribed thus

To my wellloved trusty friend comrade and brotheradventurer
Martin these

Breaking the seal I read as follows


For your sore head Martin I grieve but the blow I regret no whit
seeing it was struck to our mutual advantage hereafter Now you
reading this being at sea betwixt the parallels 70 and 65 in an open
boat and all by reason of circumstances proving too strong for you
Martin it much behoveth you to mark and heed well these my directions
to wit You shall lay your course southwesterly and that for these
several and sufficing reasons viz 1 You lie out of the track of
ships 2 These be treacherous seas given to sudden furies of wind
and raging tempest 3 I like not the look of the weather 4 Our
Island lieth scarce twentyfour hours sail due southwesterly
Whereof I have drawn for your guidance a chart of these waters
together with a plan of our Island very just and exact Also a chart
of the passage or channel through the barrierreef for saving this
passage there is no landing upon the island that I know of Nor shall
you attempt this passage except at the flood and the seas calm Being
landed Martin you shall with due regard to rest and refreshment
forthwith secure our Treasure the secret whereof I have included with
this my letter Thereupon and with all dispatch you shall
troubling not for the gold or silver take but the four caskets of
jewels and setting them aboard your boat sail away due West three
days until you shall fetch up with another island the which you shall
know by its three several hills plain to be seen and called Gibbet
Island since twas there I hanged one Juan Maldonada and richly
deserved it Here then you shall bury our Treasure four caskets in
such place as seemeth to you proper and there await my coming And if
I join you not within two months then shall this mighty treasure
threequarters thereof be yours And if I come not within six months
then shall this fortune be wholly yours since I shall be beyond all
need of it So now Martin good Fortune attend you Your boat
chosen by me long since and for this very purpose is staunch and an
excellent seaboat and very well stored with everything for your needs
as arms clothes food and the like Moreover within the treasurecave
is all manner of stores so that a man even though he bides on the land
to his lifes end need suffer no lack but have his every comfort
supplied

And now as to your head Martin twill be none the worse by this I
judge And for the blow twas no harder than called for and very
well intentioned as you shall confess one day mayhap unless you be
greater fool and blinder than I take you for Howbeit I trust you
Martin and in bidding you farewell for the nonce subscribe myself

Your faithful friend and comrade to serve
 Adam Penfeather


Having read this wordy missive I crumpled it in angry fist and thrust
it into my pocket But now she gives me the packet named therein the
which I forthwith tossed overboard like the wilful fool I was
Thereby involving us in divers and many great dangers and difficulties
as you shall learn hereafter

Howbeit the wind serving I altered our course and stood away
southwesterly even as Adam had directed since I perceived the weather
thickening behind us and the sea heaving with uneasy motion And
presently my companion questions me again

Whither do we sail

Southwesterly

Aye but whither

To an island

Is it far

Two days journey or thereabouts

Do you know this island

I have never seen it

Then why sail thither

Tis thereabouts Penfeather would meet with us again if he may

And being there what then

God knoweth

Here was silence again save for the creak of mast and timbers as we
rose to the gentle swell and the ripple of water neath our keel while
the sun high risen blazed down from the blue his fierce beams
tempered by the cool sweet wind

Are you hungry Martin

Is there aught to eat

Plenty So saying she opened one of the lockers and brought thence a
loaf of fine white bread a neats tongue a flask of wine and a small
barrico of water upon which I for one made an excellent meal Which
done she sets all things away again very orderly and sits elbow on
knee staring away into the distance and with her back to me
Hereupon I opened the sternlocker and found therein a couple of
musquetoons a brace of pistols a sword with belt and hangers and
divers kegs of powder and ball

How came you lying stunned in the boat says my companion at last
but without turning her head

By roguery I answered But how and when did the mutiny start

Twas when we went to fetch the boy my little page Marjorie and I
He lay hurt and crying on the deck so we ran out to him and took him
up betwixt us and then I heard shouts and rush of feet and they were
all about usdrunken men singing and dancing And they struggled with
us till came Master Penfeather with Godby and others and after much
bitter fighting brought us away But Marjorie my dear faithful
Marjorie had taken a blow aimed at me and died  in my arms  And
the great cabin choking with powdersmoke  and wounded men who cried
and shouted My dear brave Marjorie With the dark the fight began
again and twice I feared they would break in upon us Then Master
Adam brought me into the sterngallery and lowered me into the boat
where I might lie secure and so got him back into the battle But in a
little I saw a hand in the gloom cutting at the towrope and I
screamed but none heard And so the boat drifted away and with the
dawn I found you lying under a boatcloak

When she had done I sat awhile staring up at the peak of the sail

My Lady Brandon says I at length Fate hath set you in scurvy
company for I am an ill rogue very rough and rudemannered and no
fit company for any woman as you do very well know Howbeit I swear
that henceforth so long as we company together I will trouble you no
more than I may either by act or speech you to your place in the bows
yonder in mine here at the tiller you to your thoughts I to mine
And thus methinks we shall do well enough until we can go our several
ways

Must we not speak she questioned keeping her face turned from me

When needful madam

Am I but to answer when you deign me notice Will it plague you if I
sing Am I to sit with my hands folded henceforth and do nought but
think Must I stay in the bows until you summon me thence says she
and all in the same small soft voice so that I perceived my fine
speech had been thrown away wherefore I stared up at the sail and with
never a word in answer

But presently chancing to look at her I found her regarding me with
her dimpled chin set mighty resolute Because says she meeting my
look I shall talk when I will and sing when so minded Martin
Conisby I shall not sit in the bows for tis wet there and I shall
not fold my hands but you shall teach me how to steer and handle the
boat and do my share of the labour For look now here are we by no
will of our own God knoweth companions in misfortune let us then aid
each other that our troubles be the easier And O pray do you forget
Martin Conisby his woes awhile And away she goes and getting to her
knees before one of the lockers begins rearranging the contents
singing away the while merry as any grig

As the day wore on the skies clouded over with a wind very sudden and
blusterous wherefore misliking the look of things I was for
shortening sail but feared to leave the helm lest the boat should
broach to and swamp while this was adoing But the wind increasing I
was necessitated to call my companion beside me and teach her how she
must counter each windgust with the helm and found her very apt and
quick to learn So leaving the boat to her manage I got me forward and
with no little todo doublereefed our sail leaving just sufficient
to steer by which done I glanced to my companion where she leaned to
the tiller her long hair streaming out upon the wind her lithe body
asway to the pitching of the boat and steering as well as I myself
From her I gazed to windward where an ominous and evergrowing
blackness filled me with no small apprehensions wherefore I made fast
all our loose gear as oars spare sail spars and the like Now in
the bows were stowed her belongings a leathern trunk and divers
bundles the which I proceeded to secure in their turn This done I
got me aft again but when I would have relieved her of the tiller she
shook her head

Nay let me steer a while she cried looking up through her
windtossed hair tis joy to me Lay you down and rest a while and
trust the boat to me And seeing how quick she was to meet each send
of the seas that were already running high glad enough was I to
humour her whim and clambered forward again And there having nought
better to do I set about rigging a rough awning athwart the bows with
canvas and a stout spar which methought should keep out the spray and
any chance sea that might break forward though indeed the boat seemed
mighty staunch and seaworthy to a miracle

With every hour the wind waxed in fury and therewith the sea rose
huge rolling billows that came roaring up astern to whirl us aloft
amid hissing brine and passing left us deepplunged in great foaming
hollows Being got back aft at last and with no small exertion by
reason of the boats pitching I stared amazed to hear my companion
singing right joyously

O Martin she cried her voice athrill with the clear vital ring I
knew so well O Martin the wonder and glory of it See yonder on
these mighty waters Death rides crying to us But God is there also
and if these rushing surges whelm us we dying shall find God there
And beholding her as she sat her face uplifted to the tempest her
seawet hair upborne upon the wind I marvelled within myself And
the boat Martin cries she as we rose on a hissing wavecrest This
dear brave boat See how nobly she ridesindeed and indeed I do love
her every timber

And verily to me awed by these mighty waters it was wonderful to see
how our little craft rose to the seas buoyant as any cork now poised
mid hissing foam high in air now plunging dizzily down and ever the
wind gathered fury until the very air seemed full of whirling spindrift

In a while I took the tiller and wondered to see my companion droop
all at once with head bowed upon her hands

Are you sick I cried

Tis but weariness she answered I slept no wink last night

Why then go forward and lie down says I The which she did
forthwith and made less business of it than I Reaching the mast she
paused thereby to behold my handiwork then going on her knees crept
beneath the awning and vanished from my view

Left alone I stared around me on the raging tumult and beholding all
its terrors my mind was full of wonder of this maid who could sing so
blithely with Death all about her and behold God as it were riding on
the wings of the storm

Presently she comes and sits close beside me that we might talk for
the wind was very loud

It was kind of you to make me so fair a shelter Martin and a bed
also kind and very thoughtful but I shall not sleep tonight unless
it be here

And why here

Death hath more terrors in the dark and I grow a little fearful
Martin So saying she wrapped a boatcloak about her and spreading
out the other lay down thereon and so near that I might have touched
her where she lay

And in a while Night rushed down upon us and it was dark but from the
dark her voice reached me where she lay her head pillowed at my feet
and I crouching above her strove to shelter her somewhat from the
lashing spray and buffeting wind Thus in despite of raging tempest we
contrived to make each other hear though with difficulty talking on
this wise

She Are you afraid

Myself No

She Have you then no fears of death

Myself I have prayed for it ere now

She And vainly For God instead hath made you very hale and strong

Myself Aye for a purpose

She What purpose

Here seeing I held my peace she questioned me again Was your
purpose the slaying of my father He is an old man and feeble

Myself He plotted the downfall of our house and slew my father

She And so you have prayed for vengeance

Myself I have

She And God hath denied you this also Should you die tonight you go
to him innocent of your enemys blood

Myself Aye but if I live

She You shall grow wiser mayhap and forgetting the ill that lies
behind you reach out to the good that lieth before

Myself And what of my just vengeance

She Vengeance is but for the weak of soul tis only the strong can
forgive

Myself What of my sacred vow What of my many prayers for vengeance

She Empty breath

Myself Dare you say so

She I dare more for lying here with Death all about us I tell you
Martin Conisby despite your size and strength you are no better than
a pitiful peevish child

Ha cried I fiercely bending over her in the dimness until I might
stare into her eyes wide and dark in the pale oval of her face Will
ye dare

A child says she again nodding at me lost and wilful and very
selfish with no thought above Martin Conisby and his wrongs Nay scowl
not nor grind your teeth tis vain For how may I that fear not
Gods dreadful tempest stoop to fear poor Martin Conisby

Stoop madam I cried hoarsely

Aye stoop says she The wrongs you have endured have plunged you
to the very deeps have stripped you of your manhood And yetyours is
no murderers face even when you scowl and clench your fist Twas so
you looked when you fought that rough boy on my behalf so many years
ago when you were Sir Martin the Knighterrant and I was Princess
Damaris And now Martin you that were my playmate and had
forgotyou that were so ready to fight on my behalfin this
desolation there is none you may do battle with for my sake saving
onlyMartin Conisby

Now here she turned her face hid from me neath a fold of the great
boatcloak and spake no more And I crouched above her staring down
at her muffled form outstretched thus at my mercy felt my quivering
fist relax felt my brutish anger cower before her trust and
fearlessness And so leaning across the tiller I stared away into
the raging dark and now it seemed that the soul of me had sunk to
deeps more black and groping blindly there hungered for the light

So all night long we drove before the tempest through a pitchy gloom
full of the hiss of mighty seas that roared past us in the dark like
raging giants And all night long she lay her head pillowed at my
feet sleeping like a wearied child and her long windtossed hair
within touch of my hand



CHAPTER XXIII

DIVERS PERILS AND DANGERS AT SEA

Towards dawn the wind abated more and more and glancing into the
lightening East I saw the black stormclouds pierced as it were by a
sword of glory a single vivid ray that smote across the angry waters
waxing ever more glorious until up flamed the sun before whose joyous
beams the sullen clouds scattered little by little and melted away

And now I that was doomed to be my own undoing instead of thanking
that merciful God who had delivered us from such dire peril must needs
scowl upon this kindly sun and fall again to my black humours For
the immediate dangers past I began to ponder the future and inwardly
to rage against that perverse fate the which was driving me whither it
would So crouched chin on fist scowling across these tempestuous
waters for though the wind was fallen the seas ran very high within
myself I cursed Adam Penfeather and all his works

You are hungry Martin Turning about I beheld my companion sitting
up regarding me with eyes that belied her solemn mouth

How should you know this

You frown Martin Though the storm is done and we alive yet you
frown Have patience and you shall eat and sleep

I want neither one nor other I began

And you are wet Martin

Tis no matter

And cold

The sun shall warm me

So you shall eat and lie here i the sunshine and sleep And away
she goes to vanish under the dripping penthouse forward the which had
served its purpose admirably well whiles I perceiving the waves
subsiding and the wind blowing steady and fair laid our course due
southwesterly again and lashing the helm went forward to shake out
the reefs finding it no easy task what with the stiffness of my
cramped limbs and the pitching of the boat howbeit twas done at last
but coming back I tripped across a thwart and fell cursing

Are you hurt she questioned stooping over me whereupon for very
shame I turned my back answering short and ungraciously and sat
frowning like the sullen rogue I was whiles she busily set forth the
wherewithal to break our fast and singing softly to herself

I told you I was an ill rogue and rough says I bitterly

Why so you did says she meeting my scowl with her wide calm gaze
Also you are hungry and the food is unspoiled despite the stormcome
and eat

So I ate though with mighty ill grace and found little savour in the
food for all my hunger but she waited on my wants with heedful care
my surliness notwithstanding

Whose was the hand set this boat adrift think you says I suddenly

Nay twas too dark to see

Twas Penfeather says I clenching my fist Aye it was Adam Ill
stake my life ont

Then Poor Master Adam she sighed

How Will you pity a rogue

I speak of Master Penfeather says she If he indeed cut the boat
adrift it was doubtless because the battle was going against him and he
did this to save me Hereupon I laughed and she flushing angrily
turns her back on me

Pray you she questioned when may we hope to reach the island and
be free of each other

Tonight or tomorrow unless the storm hath driven us further than I
judge And now our meal done she sets away everything in its
appointed place and thereafter sat watching the sea all foam and
sparkle beneath the young sun And presently a sigh brake from her and
she turned her anger forgotten quite

O cries she Tis joy to be alive to breathe such air and behold
such a glory of sea and sky Look around us Martin and give thanks
And truly the sea was smooth enough save for a long rolling swell out
of the East and with a soft and gentle wind to abate the suns
generous heat Are you not glad to be alive Martin says she

To what end I answered Of what avail is life to me cast away on a
desolate island

Desolate says she starting Do you mean we shall be alone

Aye I do

But surely says she with troubled look surely Master Adam will
fetch us away

There is a chance

Andif not

God knoweth says I gloomily Tis a small island as I learn little
known and out of the track of vessels

Yet a ship may come thither to our relief

And if one doth not

Then must we tempt the sea again in our boat

I am no navigator and these seas are strange to me

Howbeit says she bravely we have good store of provisions

And when they are gonehow then think you

I think you do lack for sleep Go take your rest mayhap you shall
waken a little bolder and less despairing

And you says I you that so look on all this as a joyous
adventure

Joyous Ah God she cried Do you think because I do not weep that
my heart is not full of misery and grief to lose thus home and friends
and country and live prisoned and solitary with such as you that
think but on your own selfish woes and in your big body bear the soul
of a fretful babe I hate you Martin Conisby scorn and despise you
And now give me the tiller and begone to your sleep Saying which she
pointed where she had spread the cloaks hard by the midship thwart and
I amazed by her fierce outburst suffered her to take the tiller from
my hold and coming amidships laid myself down even as she had
commanded

But no thought of sleep had I rather I lay that I might watch her
furtively beneath my arm where she sat head aloft cheeks flushed
and bosom tempestuous And despite her beauty a very termagant shrew
I thought her Then all at once I saw a tear fall and another and
she that had sung undaunted to the tempest and outfaced its fury sat
bitterly weeping like any heartbroke maid yet giving due heed to our
course none the less Presently chancing to look my way she catches
me watching her and knits her slender brows at me

Get you to sleep says she O get you to sleep nor trouble my
grief

Hereupon and feeling mighty guilty I pillowed my head and closing my
eyes presently fell to sweet and dreamless slumber



CHAPTER XXIV

HOW WE CAME TO BLACK BARTLEMYS ISLAND

Martin Martinlook

I started up and rubbing sleep from my eyes turned to gaze whither
she pointed and there faint and far above the rolling blue of the
seas rose a blue shape Tis the island Martin Our voyaging is nigh
ended

Aye tis the island says I

Tis like an island of dream Martin

Nay tis real enough quoth I And solitary

There is a perspective glass in the locker yonder Martin

Master Adam was vastly thoughtful quoth I bitterly And reaching
the glass I gave it to her

Will you not look at the island she questioned wonderingly

Nay I shall see more than enough of it ere long Do you give me the
tiller and view it as you will

I see rocks says she after some while

Ha a barren place as I thought

Nay there are treesmany trees O tis wonderful And so she sat
viewing it all untiring every moment discovering some new marvel but
I fell to my old black humour since to me this island was no better
than a prison

By midday we were come so close that I might see the place very well
a smallish island with sheer cliffs very jagged and grim where the seas
broke in foam and crowned with many and divers trees beyond which rose
greeny slopes with more trees that mounted up and up to a lofty summit
of rocks and brush Being within some two miles of these forbidding
cliffs I steered to fetch a compass about the island and so presently
opened a bay of white sand with treeclad cliffs beyond and before a
sheet of placid water or lagoon shut off from the sea by a semicircular
barrierreef such as Adam had described in his story

And now bethinking me that by his account this was the only means of
landing upon the island I stood for this reef against which the
foaming seas dashed with a mighty roaring looking for that narrow
channel through the reef that opening amid these breakers whereby we
might steer into those calm waters beyond

And presently sure enough I espied it wellnigh in the middle of the
reef even as Adam had said and putting up the helm ran for it
straightway An evil enough place it looked perilously narrow and
with mighty seas that broke in thunderous spray to right and left of
it insomuch that heedful of Adams warning and all too late I was
minded to bear up and stand away plying off and on until the waves
should have moderated But in my folly I had sailed too near and now
swept onward by some current the boat responding no more to her helm
was borne on at everincreasing speed So thus helpless and at mercy
of the seas we drove straight for this perilous channel until I had
some desperate hope that she might make it on we sped nearer and
nearer until the spume of the breakers was all about us and I
wellnigh deafened by their roar but this roar was pierced suddenly by
a cry

O Martin God pity uslook Turning my head I saw a hugeous wave
hard upon us felt my companions arms about me and thendeafened
blinded choking I was whirled aloft on this mighty sea tossed
buffeted hurled into blinding sunlight buried beneath green deeps
and expectant of death suddenly found myself face down on warm sands
wherein my griping fingers clutched desperately against the backrush
of the sea

So lay I gasping and gripping this kindly earth and waited to do battle
for what remained of life hearkening for the fierce hiss of that great
wave that was to bear me back to the horror of those green deeps the
which should bury me for ever instead I heard the gentle drowsy
lapping of water all about me and opening my eyes beheld myself lying
on the edge of those white sands that bordered the lagoon while behind
me the seas thundered impotent against the reef And now little by
little I saw that the great wave must have borne me hither in
miraculous fashion and lying thus bruised and spent I must needs
remember how Adam had experienced the like

But all at once I staggered up to my feet and began staring hither and
thither then as my brain cleared and strength came back I took to
running along the edge of the lagoon like one demented staring down
into those placid waters and searching the white sands with eyes of
dreadful expectancy yet nowhere could I discover sign or trace of my
companion None the less I continued to run aimlessly back and forth
heedless of my going slipping and stumbling and often falling but
never staying my search until the sweat poured from me And ever as I
ran I kept repeating these words to myself over and over again viz
Adams comrade Nicholas Frant was cast safe ashore with him Thus I
ran to and fro gasping these words to myself until tripping over a
piece of driftwood I lay bruised and wellnigh spent Howbeit I
forced myself up again and recommenced my search and this time with
more method for I swore to myself that I would find her or perish
also To this end I determined to get me out upon the reef now to
come thither I must needs climb over certain rocks so came I thither
and breathless with haste made shift to mount these rocks heedless of
bruises or bleeding hands and reaching the summit at last paused all
at once

She lay face down almost below these rocks outstretched within a
little cove and her long wet hair widetossed like drifted seaweed all
about her Now seeing how still she lay a great sickness seized me
so that I sank weakly to my knees and crouched thus a while and with
no strength nor will to move At last and very slowly I made my way
adown the rocks and being within the little cove found myself all
trembling and holding my breath Then though the soft sand deadened
all sound of my going I crept forward So came I where she lay her
wet draperies clinged fast about her and standing above this stilly
form I looked down upon her slender shapeliness yet feared to touch
her And now I saw that one sleeve was torn away and upon her round
white arm the marks my cruel hands had wrought

Damaris says I falling on my knees beside her and the word was a
groan And in that moment she raised her head and looked at me and in
her eyes methought to read wonder and a sudden great joy

Martin she whispered O thank God And so hid her face again
Now being yet on my knees I looked from her to the blue heaven and
round about me like one that wakes upon a new world



CHAPTER XXV

HOW I WAS HAUNTED OF BLACK BARTLEMY

Are you hurt says I at last

Indeed she answered all over Yet am I alive and theres the
wonder The wave cast me into the lagoon and I crept ashore here
Then methought you surely dead and I alone within these solitudes and
so I swooned Martin

Being afraid of the loneliness

Yes Martin

Even fellow as rough as I is better than loneliness

Yes Martin

Though your arms be bruised by my handling For this II would crave
your pardon

Tis all forgot says she making shift to cover up her arm But
your hand is bleeding

A scratch

Have you no other hurts

A bruise or so

And did you come aseeking me Martin

Yes

Are you glad to find me alive

Yes

Even a Brandon is better than nobody Martin But at this I arose
albeit stiffly and turned away Whither would you go she
questioned

To seek some shelter ere night catch us

Shall I not come with you

Can you walk

Hereupon she made to rise but getting to her knees flinched and bit
her lip

Im so bruised Martin says she

Why then bide you here yonder cleft i the rock should serve for
tonight Howbeit Ill go look So I limped across the beach to
where showed a great fissure in the cliff hard beside a lofty tree
being come within this cleft I found it narrow suddenly and at the end
a small cave very dry and excellent suited to our purpose Moreover
close at hand was a little rill that bubbled among mossy rocks mighty
pleasant to be heard And hereabouts grew all manner of vines
sweetsmelling shrubs and fern of these I gathered goodly quantity and
strowing them within the cave therewith made a very passable bed which
done I went back where she lay adrying her wet garments in the warm
sun as well as she might

Martin says she mighty doleful I have lost my comb and all my
hairpins

I will fashion you others

Aye but the boat Martin our dear brave boat

Tomorrow I will seek what remains of her

And our storesall lost Martin

I can find more

Where

Among the rocks and on the trees There should be no lack of fruit
and fish according to Adam

Nay but sighed she shaking woeful head even though we contrive to
live thus yet here must we bide far from our kind with small hopes of
relief and destitute of all things to our comfort

Why look now says I here in my pocket is a tinder box the which
is a very comfortable thing here in my belt a good stout knife
which is another comfortable thing and yonder is a cave dry and airy
shall make you a goodly chamber so take comfort tonight at least
And drawing my knife I betook me to whetting the blade on the sole of
my damp shoe Glancing up at last I found my companion regarding me
with strange expression

Methinks you are greatly changed says she

How changed

In the boat you did nought but cry out and rail gainst fortune but
now Martin

Now says I the sun is low and night cometh apace in these
latitudes let me know you sheltered ere it be dark and sheathing my
knife I rose Then seeing what effort she made to come to her knees I
reached her my hand aiding her up to her feet So she takes a step
and stifling a cry of pain would have fallen but for my arm

O Martin says she with rueful shake of the head I fear I cannot
walk

Lean on me

Tis vain says she catching her breath I cannot set this foot to
ground

Have you any bones broke

Nay tis none so bad as that

Wheres your hurt

My kneemy ankle And Im direly bruised Martin

But you cannot sleep out here

I needs must The sand is warm and soft to my bed

There is a better waiting you in the cave yonder

Butif I cannot walk Martin

Why then says I why then you must suffer that I carry you

I fear I amgreatly heavy Martin

As to that says I and lifting her as gently as I might began to
bear her across the beach And after we had gone thus some way she
spoke

I fear me I am vastly heavy

No says I keeping my gaze before me

Yet you go very slowly

Tis that I would not jostle you

And the sand is illgoing belike Martin

Most true says I pretending to stumble

Why then I pray you take your time At this I ventured to glance
down at her but saw no more than the curve of a cheek and the tip of a
little ear and staring at this came very near blundering into a rock
So I bore her into the rocky cleft already full of shadow taking due
heed in my going yet mighty conscious of all the yielding softness of
her none the less

Your clothes are very damp says I

They will be dry ere morning she answered her voice muffled

I had best light a fire then

There is no need tis very warm I do think

Tis good against wild beasts and the like says I

Why then as you will Martin

Reaching the little cave at last she would have had me set her down
but I bade her lie still and getting to my knees within the cave I
laid her upon her ferny bed whereat she uttered a little cry of
pleasure

Why Martin says she snugging down here is wondrous soft bed and
fragrant

Twill serve until I can contrive a better quoth I and coming
without the cave stood looking down on her while the night deepened
about us apace

And what of you Martin

I shall sleep here beyond the fire

Do you think there be any wild beasts hereabouts

God knoweth says I Howbeit you may sleep secure and fear nothing

I know that O I know that says she gently

Do you lack for aught

Only sleep Martin

Why then Ill set about making the fire So I fell to gathering
twigs and driftwood of which there was no lack and taking out my
tinderbox albeit the tinder was still damp soon contrived to have
the fire crackling right merrily This done and with store of fuel to
hand I scooped me out a hollow in the warm sand and lying therein
found myself very well the aches of my many bruises notwithstanding
The night air struck chill through my damp garments but now stretched
in the comfort of the fire there grew within me a great wonder at our
miraculous deliverance and this led me to ponder upon our present
situation cast thus destitute upon this lonely island where devoid of
every comfort and necessity we must needs live in barbarous fashion as
best we might until either Penfeather should come to our relief or we
be taken off by some chance vessel And supposing thinks I that
neither chance befall and we doomed to drag out our days to their
miserable end Here I must needs bethink me of all the woeful tales I
had heard of marooners or poor shipwrecked mariners who by reason of
wretchedness and hardship had run mad or become baser than the brutes
And now I must needs take out and read Penfeathers crumpled letter
and bethinking me how in my wicked folly I had cast overboard the
packet of instructions whereby we must at least have found all those
stores he made mention of from cursing him I straightway fell to
bitter recriminations of my vain self

Are you asleep Martin

No Here I heard her sigh and a rustle as she turned on her leafy
couch

O Martin surely God hath had us in His care to bring us safe through
so many dangers and methinks His gentle hand will be over us still

Have you no fear of what is to be

None Martinnot now But had I found myself alone herehurt and
helpless in the darkand really alone O methinks I should have died
indeed or lost my wits and perished so O truly truly God is
infinitely merciful

Thus and all unknowing she rebuked my ungrateful despondency For
thinks I if she a woman accustomed to ease and comfort may thus
front our desperate fortunes undismayed and with faith unshaken how
much more should I a man inured to suffering and hardened by
privation Thus checking my gloomy foreboding I too breathed a
prayer to God for His infinite mercies and thereafter fell to
pondering how I might supply our more pressing needs with such small
means as I possessed and so in a while dozed off to sleep

I started up knife in hand to find the moon very big and bright
flooding the world with a radiance wondrous to behold and blinking
drowsily I wondered what had waked me Now as I gazed about me the
place seemed all at once to take on an evil look what with its steepy
sides abristle with tangled vines and bushes and pierced here and
there with black holes and fissures and I shivered The fire being
low I minded to replenish it was groping for my fuel when I started
and remained peering up at the cliff above with ears on the stretch
and every nerve atingle The night was very calm and still for the
wind had died away and save for the distant murmur of the surf beyond
the reef nought was to hear then and all at once from one of those
black holes in the rock above I heard a longdrawn sighing breath and
therewith a faint scuffling Slowly and cautiously I got to my feet
and with knife gripped ready began to creep thither and now within
one of these gloomy crevices in the rockface I saw a crouching shape
that as I drew nearer sprang away with a snort and clatter and I saw
this was a large goat

And surely no poor wight ever more relieved than I as sheathing my
knife I wiped the sweat from me and now to relief was added a mighty
satisfaction for where was one goat would be others Thus my fears
allayed and bethinking me how savoury was a mess of goatsflesh I
fell awatering at the mouth like the hungry animal I was

Having no more mind to sleep and the moon so marvellous bright I
wandered forth of these shadowy rocks and being upon the sands stood
to look about me Before me stretched the wide ocean a desolation of
heaving waters that rolling shorewards broke in splendour neath the
moon to my right lay a curve of silver beach backed by cliffs and
groves of stately palms and to my left and hard beside these bushgirt
rocks was a great and lofty tree

Now observing this tree more closely its mighty writhen branches and
gnarled roots and how it stood close against the opening in the cliff
an uneasy feeling possessed me that this tree and its immediate
surroundings were all familiar almost as I had seen it before though
I knew this could not be So stood I chin in hand staring about me
and ever my unease grew and then

So that night Martin the moon being high and bright I came to that
stretch of silver sand where they lay together rigid and pale and
though I had no tool but his dagger and a piece of driftwood I
contrived to bury them neath the great pimento tree that stood beside
the rockcleft and both in the same grave

It was for all the world as though Adam had repeated the words in my
ear insomuch that I glanced round as almost expecting to see him So
then it was here Black Bartlemy had died at the hands of the poor
tortured Spanish lady and here they lay buried their bones mouldering
together within a yard of me And standing in this dismal spot I must
needs mind Adams narrative and great was my pity for this poor Spanish
lady

In a while I got me back to the fire and lying down fain would have
slept but my mind was full of Adams story Howbeit after some while
what with fatigue and the warmth of the fire slumber took me

But in my sleep the dead arose and stood fronting each other beneath a
pallid moon Bartlemy in all the bravery of velvet and lace and flowing
periwig and the Spanish lady tall and proud and deadly pale And now
as she shrank from his evil touch I saw that her face was the face of
Joan Brandon Sweating in dumb anguish I watched Bartlemy grip her in
cruel hands and bend her backward across his knee while she stared up
at him with eyes of horror her lips moving in passionate entreaty
But as he bent over her was a flash of steel and deepsmitten he
staggered back to the great tree and leaning there fell into a fit of
wild laughter so that the silver daggerhilt that was shaped like a
woman seemed to dance and leap upon his quickheaving breast then as
he swayed there laughing his life out he raised his face to the pale
moon and I saw that the face of Black Bartlemy was my own



CHAPTER XXVI

WE COME UPON GRIM EVIDENCES OF ADAM PENFEATHER

Waking to a glory of sun I found my companion looking down on me all
anxiouseyed where she knelt her hand upon my shoulder

Why Joan says I drowsily my lady

You are groaning Martin so I came to you

Groaning says I flinching from her touch Twas nought An ill
fancya dream no more But here is the sun well up and I asnoring

Nay you groaned and cried out Martin And tis yet full early

And youll be mighty hungry and for that matter so am I So saying I
rose and without more ado strode away across the sands towards the
reef Now as I went I chanced upon a great turtleshell to my joy
and divers others marvellously shaped and tinted and chose such as
might serve us for cups and the like With these beneath my arm I
clambered out upon the reef and the tide being out saw many rocks
amongst which I had soon collected good store of shellfish as limpets
oysters and others much like to a periwinkle though larger Filling
my turtleshell with these I took it neath my arm again and went on
following the curve of the reef clambering over these slimy rocks and
found it no small labour what with my burden and the heat of the sun
but I persevered seeking some fragment of our boat or the stores
wherewith she had been so well laden Yet and search how I might
found nought to reward me Having thus traversed the whole reef and
explored the rocks beyond very thoroughly I cast me down beside the
lagoon to bathe my hands and face and rest myself awhile Presently
chancing to turn my head I saw a place of trees hard by and started
up my weariness clean forgotten For divers of these trees bore great
clusters of yellowish fruit the which I knew for a sort of plantain
very wholesome and of delicate savour So casting out my limpets and
periwinkles I hasted to pluck good store of this fruit and with my
turtleshell thus well laden hastened back to our refuge very well
content

My companion being absent I seated myself in the shade and began
opening the oysters with my knife as well as I might in the which
occupation she presently found me and grew very merry at my clumsy
efforts And now I noticed that she had wrought her long hair into two
braids very thick and glossy also she had somehow contrived to mend
the rents in her gown and her torn sleeve

Why you have combed your hair says I wondering and speaking my
thought aloud

With my fingers they must be my comb until you can make me a
betteralack my poor hair

Why then you must have a comb so soon as I can contrive one But now
see the breakfast nature hath provided us withal

And who so full of pleased wonderment as she particularly as regarded
the fruit which she pronounced delicious but my shellfish she showed
small liking for though I found them eatable enough Seeing her so
pleased I told her I hoped to provide better fare very soon and
recounted my adventure with the goat

But says she how shall you go ahunting and no firearms

With a bow and arrows

Have you found these also

No I must make them I shall look out a sapling shaped to my purpose
and trim it with my knife For the cord of my bow I will have leather
strips cut from my jerkin

Aye but your arrows Martin how shall you barb them without iron

True says I somewhat hipped But in that moment my eye lighted on
a piece of driftwood I had gathered for fuel and reaching it I laid
it at her feet There says I pointing to the heads of divers rusty
bolts that pierced it here is iron enough to arm a score of arrows

But how shall you make them Martin

Heat the iron soft and hammer it into shape

But you have neither hammer nor anvil

Stones shall do

O wonderful she cried

Nay it is not done yet says I a little shamefaced

And how may I help you

Watch me work

Indeed and I will keep your fire going So come let us begin

Our meal done I gathered twigs for kindling and a great pile of
driftwood of which was no lack and with small boulders I builded a
fireplace against the cliff where we soon had a fire drawing merrily
wherein I set my precious piece of timber Having charred it
sufficiently I found it an easy matter to break out the iron bolts and
nails five of them there were of from four to eight inches in length
and though the ends were much corroded by the sea there yet remained
enough sound iron for my purpose And now my bolts ready for the fire
I began to look for some stone that might serve me for hammer and my
companion likewise Suddenly as I sought and mighty diligent I heard
her cry out to me and beholding her leaning in the cave mouth all
pale and trembling came running

What ist cries I struck by the horror of her look

O Martin she gasped O Martintis in thereall huddledin the
darkest corner And II slept with itbeside me all night Coming
within the cave I looked whither her shaking hand pointed and saw what
I took at first for a monstrous egg and beyond this the staves of a
small barrel then bending nearer I saw these were the skull and ribs
of a man And this man had died very suddenly for the skeleton lay
face down one bony arm folded under him the other widetossed and the
skull shattered behind showed a small round hole just above and
betwixt the cavernous eyesockets about the ribs were the mouldering
remains of a leathern jerkin girt by a broad belt wherein was a knife
and a rusty sword but that which pleased me mightily was a thing still
fastclenched in these bony fingers and this no other than a heavy
hatchet So disturbing these poor bones as little as need be I took
the hatchet and thereafter sword and knife and then turning to go
stopped all at once for tied about the bony neck by a leathern thong I
espied a shrivelled parchment Wondering I took this also and coming
without the cave found my companion leaning as I had left her and very
shaky

O Martin says she shivering and I slept within touch of it

But you slept very well and he poor soul is long past harming you or
any So saying I smoothed out the crackling parchment and holding it
in her view saw this writ very bold and clear

Benjamin Galbally Slain of necessity June 20 1642 This for a sign to
like Rogues

Adam Penfeather

Will this be our Adam Penfeather Martin

Indeed says I there is methinks but one Adam Penfeather in this
world the which is just as well mayhap

Then he murdered this poor man

Why the fellow had this hatchet in his fist it hath lain rusting in
his grasp all these years methinks his blow came something too late
Though he must be mighty quick whod outmatch Penfeather I guess No
this man I take it died in fight Though why Adam must set this
placard about the poor rogues neck is beyond me

Let us go away Martin This is an evil place

It is says I glancing at the great pimento tree that marked the
grave of the poor Spanish lady and Black Bartlemy Truly we will seek
out another habitation and that at once Howbeit I have gotten me my
hammer And I showed her the hatchet the which unlike the ordinary
boardingaxe was furnished with a flat behind the blade thus

CHAPTER XXVII

DIVERS ADVENTURES ON THE ISLAND

Seeing my companion so anxious to be gone I left my fire to burn out
and giving her my hand forthwith turned my back on this place of
death nor sorry to do it

Following the base of the cliff we found an opening in the rock vaulted
and arched by nature so that it was of white sands bordering the
lagoon the which we there and then agreed to call Deliverance in
memory of our escape What with the soft sand and scattered rocks it
was illgoing for my companion but though she limped painfully she
held bravely on nevertheless being of a mighty resolute mind as this
narrative will show

Now as we went slowly thus I pointed out caves aplenty and very
proper to our purpose but she would have none of them and was forever
lifting her eyes to the cliffs and treeclad greeny slopes beyond

Let us seek above says she where there be trees and mayhap
flowers for Martin I do love trees

Nay but says I none save a bird or a goat may climb yonder

Let us be patient and seek a way Martin

And you all bruised and lame

Nay I am very well andsee yonder Looking whither she would have
me I saw beyond this great jutting rock a green opening in the
cliffs with a gentle ascent

O Martin cries she stopping suddenly O Martin tis like England
tis like one of our dear Kentish lanes And indeed so it was being
narrow and grassy and shady with trees save that these were such trees
as never grew on English soil

Let us go Martin let us go

So we began the ascent and despite the blazing sun the slope being
gradual found it easier than it had looked On we went and though
she often stumbled she made nought of it nor stayed until we were come
to a green level or plateau whence the ground before us trended
downwards to a wondrous fertile little valley where ran a notable
stream twixt reedy banks here also bloomed flowers a blaze of varied
colours and beyond these again were flowery thickets a very maze of
green boskages besplashed with the vivid colour of flower or bird for
here were many such birds that flew hither and thither on gaudy wings
and filling the air with chatterings and whistlings strange to be heard

Now beholding all this my companion sank to the ground and sat very
still and silent like one rapt in pleasing wonder

O says she at last and very softly Surely here is an earthly
paradise O Martin the beauty of it

Yet these flowers have no smell says I And for these gaudy birds
I would give them all for one honest English robin or sweetthroated
black bird

But she chin in hand sat agazing upon this prospect as she would
never tire As for me I began to look around and the more I looked
the better I liked this place pleasantly shaded as it was by trees and
affording from this eminence a wide view of the sea the lagoon and
Deliverance Beach below Moreover I heard near by the pleasant sound
of falling water and drawn by this came to a flowery thicket and
forcing my way through paused suddenly as well I might for before
me set in the face of a rock was a door All askew it hung and grown
over with a riot of weed and vines and behind the weatherworn timber I
saw the gloom of a cavern

Approaching this door I found it built with ships timbers exceeding
stout and strong joined by great battens clamped with bolts and nails
and in the midst a loophole and besides this I saw divers shotmarks
in these timbers the which set me awondering Now having my hatchet
in hand I set about cutting away bush and vines and forcing wide the
door the which swung twixt great beams like jambs clamped to the
rock I stepped into the cool dimness beyond The place was irregular
of shape but very spacious and lighted by a narrow weedchoked crevice
high up that admitted a soft greeny glow very pleasing after the glare
of the sun by which light I perceived that from this cave two smaller
caves opened Now seeing this place had once been the abode of some
poor castaway I sought high and low in hopes of finding something to
our use if no more than a broken cup but came on nothing save the ruin
of a small table the place was bare as my hand I was yet busied in
my fruitless search when comes my companion all pleasedeyed wonderment

Why tis as good as any cottage cries she

And better than some says I for here is no thatch to leak and no
windows to break and let in the rain

O Martin for a broom says she looking around upon the floor
ankledeep in dead leaves twigs and the like O for a broom

These leaves be well enough

But better for a broom Martin

Why then a broom you shall have says I and coming without the cave
I cut twigs sufficient to my purpose and divers lengths of vine very
strong and tough and therewith bound my twigs about a stick I had
trimmed for a handle whiles she sitting upon a great stone that lay
hard by watched me with mighty interest

You are very clever Martin says she

Tis very rough I doubt

I have seen many a worse broom used in England Martin

Why twill serve mayhap

Tis excellent says she and taking the broom from me away she limps
with it forthwith and I standing without the cave presently heard her
sweeping away despite her bruises and singing sweet as any mounting
lark I now set out to bring away such things as I had left behind as
my iron and the turtleshell the which I held of more account than all
the jewels in Adams treasure and on my way stopped to cut a stout
curved branch that I thought might furnish me a powerful bow and
another that bladed with iron should become a formidable spear
Though why my mind should run to weapons of offence seeing that the
island so far as I knew was deserted and no wild beasts I know not
Reaching Deliverance Sands I paused to look about me for such pieces of
driftwood as might serve us and came on several full of nails and
bolts some of these timbers being warped with age and others
comparatively new And looking on these poor remains of so many noble
ships and thinking of the numberless poor souls that had manned them
and gone to their account I could not but feel some awe for these
stormrent timbers as I handled them And presently as I laboured I
spied a piece newpainted and dragging it forth from sand and seaweed
knew it for the gunwale of our own boat This put me in great hopes
that I might come upon some of our stores but though I sought
diligently then and for days after I never found anything but this
poor fragment Having laid by such timbers as shewed iron of any sort
I went my way and so at last reached our first shelter And what
should I espy upon a ledge of rock just above me but a goat for a
moment the creature blinked at me chewing busily then scrambled to
its feet but in that instant I caught up a heavy stone that chanced
handy and hurled it the poor beast bleated once and rolling down the
rock thudded at my feet where I despatched it with my knife My next
care was to skin it which unlovely task I made worse by my bungling
howbeit it was done at last and I reeking of blood and sweat None the
less I persevered and having cleaned the carcass I cut therefrom such
joints as might satisfy our immediate needs and setting them in my
turtleshell with my irons hung up the carcass within the coolest part
of the cave out of reach of any prowling beast This done I went down
to the lagoon and laved my arms and hands and face cleansing myself as
well as I might and so taking my wellladen turtleshell under one
arm and the reeking skin beneath the other I set off Now it was
midday and the sun very hot insomuch that the sweat poured from me
and more than once I must needs pause to moisten my hair to keep off
the heat At last espying a palmetto that grew adjacent I made shift
to get me a leaf whereof with twigs to skewer and shape it I made me
the semblance of a hat and so tramped on again Being come to the
plateau I set down my burdens very thankful for the kindly shade and
the sweet cool wind that stirred up here and turned to find my
companion regarding me palecheeked and with eyes wide and
horrorstruck

Why what now says I taking a step towards her but seeing how she
shrank away I paused and glancing down at myself saw my clothes all
smirched with the blood of the goat How is it this says I
Well a little blood is no great matter But she still eyeing me
mightily askance I grew angry Ha quoth I Youll be thinking
doubtless of the murders aboard ship and my bloody jerkin Why then
madam think and grow as wise as you may Saying which I strode off
and thus I presently heard the soothing sound of falling water yet
look where I might could see none save that in the little valley below
Being direly athirst I began to seek for this unseen rill and little
by little was led up a steep bushgrown acclivity until all at once
I found myself in a right pleasant place for here all set about with
soft mosses fern and flowers I beheld a great oval basin or rocky
hollow some twelve feet across and brimfull of pellucid water through
which I might see the bottom carpeted with mosses and in this water my
image mirrored and what with the blood that fouled me my shaggy hair
and beard and the shapeless thing upon my head an illenough rogue I
looked

This pool was fed by a little rill that gurgled down from rocks above
and having filled the basin flowed out through a wide fissure and
down the cliff to lose itself amid flowery banks twixt which it ran
bubbling joyously to meet the river And now having satisfied my
thirst and found the water very sweet and cool I stripped and bathing
me in this pool found great solace and content insomuch that to my
great wonder I presently found myself whistling like any boy At last
I got me forth mightily refreshed and that the wind and sun might dry
me strove to cleanse my garments but finding it a thankless task I
got dressed at last but my chainshirt I left folded beside the pool
and I much more comfortable therefor

Following the dancing rill I clambered down the rocks and so into the
little valley where ran the stream Fording this I came amid thickets
where was a glory of flowers of all colours but one in especial I
noticed white and trumpetshaped And here I was often stayed by
quickset and creeping plants their stems very pliant and strong and of
the bigness of my little finger On went I haphazard through a green
twilight of leaves for here as hath been said were many trees both
great and small some of which were utterly strange to me but others I
knew for cocospalms plantain and breadfruit the which rejoiced me
greatly and hereabouts I found growing great bunches of black fruit
like to grapes though smaller and which I would not dare touch until
seeing divers birds peck at them I ventured to taste and found them
excellent So gathering some of these to stay my hunger I pressed on
despite the heat for from somewhere before me was the roar of great
waters and forced me a passage with my hatchet until this denser wood
gave place to a grove of mighty palm trees and beyond these I came
suddenly upon a great barren rock that overhung a lake whose dark
waters were troubled by a torrent hard by that poured into it with a
great rushing sound a torrent of prodigious volume though of no great
height So here thinks I is Adams notable fall of water and
sitting down I fell to viewing the place munching my grapes the
while Opposite me the lake was bounded by a highsloping sandy beach
with trees beyond while beyond these again rose that high treeclad
hill whose barren rocky dome we had seen from afar Now the waters of
this lake flooded away through a great rent in the surrounding rocks
betwixt which I might catch a glimpse of the distant sea and beholding
this rushing cataract I must needs fall awondering where so great a
body of water should come from and to ponder on the marvels of nature
And from this I got to considering how we might cross this stream
supposing we should explore the island I was yet puzzling this when
glancing up I found the sun already westering wherefore not minded
to be caught in the dark I rose and turning my back on these troubled
waters set out on my return Ever and anon as I went I caught
glimpses of that rocky eminence with its silver thread of falling water
whence I had come and guided by this strode on amain bethinking me
how best I might cook the goatsflesh for despite the grapes I was
mightily an hungered But reaching the denser woods I lost my way for
here nought was to see but the greeny gloom of tangled thickets and
densegrowing boskages where I must needs cut a path yet even so I
troubled myself with divers bunches of grapes that my companion might
prove my discovery Thus my progress was slow and wearisome and night
found me still forcing my way through this tangled underwood Being
lost and in the dark I sat me down to wait for the moon and stayed my
hunger with the grapes meant for better purpose but one bunch that
methought the better I preserved Soon this leafy gloom glowed with a
silvery radiance and by this light I went on and so at last came upon
the stream But hereabouts it ran fast and deep and I must needs seek
about till I found a ford Thus the moon was high as after desperate
scramble I came out upon our grassy plateau and saw the welcome glow
of a fire Moreover as I approached I smelt right savoury and most
delectable savour and hurrying forward saw my companion crouched upon
that stone I have mentioned her head bowed upon her hands Hearing my
step she glanced up and rose to her feet

Are you come at last Martin says she in her sweet voice Supper is
ready this hour and more

Supper says I

The goatsflesh I made a stew but fear tis spoiled

Indeed says I it smells mighty appetising

I had no salt nor spices Martin but in a little garden yonder that
is all run wild I found some sage and sweet herbs

Good says I So she brought me to the fire and there in our great
turtleshell was as savoury a stew as ever greeted eyes of hungry man

By her directions and will all due care I lifted this from the fire
and propping it with stones we sat down side by side And now she
shows me two of my smaller shells and dipping hers into the stew I did
the like and though we had no salt the which set my wits at work and
though we lacked for bread a very excellent meal we made of it and
the moon shedding its glory all about us

The meal done and while she cleansed the things at a rill that
murmured hard by I made up the fire for after the heat of the day
night struck chill and by the time she came back I had the flame
crackling merrily And now as she sat over against me on the stone I
saw she had been weeping And she knowing I saw this nodded her
head scorning all subterfuge

I feared you had met with some mischance and lay hurt Martinor
worse

You mean dead

Aye dead

Would it have mattered so much

Only that I should have died likewise

Because of the loneliness says I

Indeed she sighed staring into the fire because of the
loneliness

I serve some purpose then in the scheme of things

Yes Martin you teach a woman how even in this desolation being
weak and defenceless she may trust to a mans honour and find courage
and great comfort in his strength Twas foolish of me to be
horrorstruck at your stained garments when you had been slaying that I
might eat

Tis all forgot says I hastily

And as for the murders on the shipO Martin as if you might ever
make me believe you had committed murderor ever could You that under
all your bitterness are still the same gentle boy I knew so long ago

And why should you be so sure of all this and I but what I am says
I staring also into the fire

Mayhap because I am a woman with all a womans instinct to know the
evil from the good

Hereupon I began telling her of my exploration and describing the
wonders I had seen as the fruittrees and waterfall Whereupon she
grew eager to explore the island so soon as she might In a while I
arose and drawing my knife turned where I knew was fern aplenty

Where away she questioned rising also

I must make you a bed

Tis done Martin and yours also

Mine says I staring How should you do all this

With the old rusty sword Martin Come and see

So she brought me to the cave the moon flooding the place with its
pale radiance and I espied a goodly bed of fern very neatly contrived
in one corner

Bravely done says I

At least Martin twill be more easy than your bed of sand and
methinks you shall have no ill dreams tonight

Dreams quoth I and bethinking me of my last nights hateful visions
and now beholding the beauty of her I shivered

Are you cold

No

Why then goodnight Martin

Wait says I Wait And hasting out I brought her the grapes I
had saved telling her that though small she would find them sweet and
wholesome

Why Martin says she under her breath as one greatly surprised
Why Martin and so vanishes into her little cave forthwith and
never a word of thanks

Now being yet haunted by my dreams of yesternight I went forth into
the moonlight and walked there awhile my eyes uplifted to the glory of
the heavens and now I must needs bethink me of Godbys startime of
the dark lonely road of the beckoning light beyond and the welcoming
arms of love And hereupon I scowled and turned to stare away across
the placid sea dimpling neath the moon at the stilly waters of the
lagoon and the white curve of Deliverance Beach below but look where
I would I could see only the proud lovely face and the great
truthful eyes of this woman Joan Brandon even when my scowling brows
were bent on that distant pimento tree beneath whose towering shadow
Black Bartlemy had laughed his life out So in a while I came within
the cave and found it dim for the moonbeam was there no longer and
cast myself upon my bed very full of gloomy thoughts

Martin I thank you for your grapes Tomorrow we will gather more

Aye tomorrow

I found a shirt of chainwork by the pool Martin

Tis mine

I have set it by against your need

Nay Im done with it here is no fear of knives in the back

Are you sleepy Martin

No but tis plaguy dark

But you are there says she so I do not fear the dark

Tomorrow I will make a lamp Here she fell silent and I think to
sleep but as for me I lay long oppressed by my thoughts Aye
verily says I at last speaking my thought aloud as had become my
custom in my solitude tomorrow I will contrive a lamp for light is
a goodly thing Now here I heard a rustle from the inner cave as she
had turned in her sleep for she spake no word and so despite my
thoughts I too presently fell to blessed slumber

Now if there be any who reading this my narrative shall think me too
diffuse and particular in the chapters to follow I do hereby humbly
crave their pardon but maugre my readers weariness shall not abate
one word or sentence since herein I that by my own folly have known
so little of happiness do record some of the happiest hours that ever
man knew so that it is joy again to write Therefore to such as would
read of rogues and roguish doings of desperate fights encounters and
affrays I would engage him to pass over these next few chapters for
he shall find overmuch of these things ere I make an end of this tale
of Black Bartlemys Treasure Which very proper advice having duly set
down I will again to my narrative



CHAPTER XXVIII

I BECOME A JACKOFALLTRADES

Early next morning having bathed me in the pool and breakfasted with
my companion on what remained of our goatsflesh I set to work to
build me a fireplace in a fissure of the rock over against the little
valley and close beside a great stone smooth and flattopped that
should make me an anvil what time my companion collected a pile of
kindlingwood Soon we had the fire going merrily and whilst my iron
was heating I chose a likely piece of wood and splitting it with the
hatchet fell to carving it with my knife

What do you make now Martin

Here shall be a spoon for you twill help you in your cooking

Indeed it will Martin But you are very skilful

Nay tis simple matter says I whittling away but very conscious of
her watchful eyes I have outworn many a weary hour carving things
with my knife Given time and patience a man may make anything

Some men says she whereat I grew foolishly pleased with myself
The wood being soft and dry and my knife sharp the spoon grew apace and
her interest in it and because it was for her and she so full of
pleased wonder I elaborated upon it here and there until having
shaped it to my fancy I drew my iron from the fire and with the
glowing end burned out the bowl scraping away the charred wood until
I had hollowed it sufficiently and the spoon was finished And
because she took such pleasure in it now and hereafter I append here
a rough drawing of it

Drawing of a spoon

Tis wonderful cries she turning it this way and that Tis
admirable

It might be better says I wishing I had given more labour to it

I want no better Martin And now she would have me make another for
myself

Nay mine can wait But there is your comb to make

How shall you do that Martin

Of wood like the Indians but twill take time

Why then it shall wait with your spoon first should come
necessities

As what

Dear Heaven they be so many says she with rueful laugh For one
thing a cookingpot Martin

There is our turtleshell says I

Why tis very well Martin for a turtleshell but clumsya little
I would have a panwith handles if you could contrive And then plates
would be a good thing

Handles says I rubbing my chin Handlesaye by all means a pan
with handles but for this we must have clay

And then Martin platters would be useful things

So they will I nodded These I can fashion of wood

And then chairs and a table Martin

True says I growing gloomy Table and chairs would be easy had I
but a saw I could make you shelves and a cupboard had I but fortuned
to find a saw instead of this hatchet

Nay Martin says she smiling at my doleful visage Why this
despond If you can make me so wondrous a spoon with nought but your
knife and a piece of driftwood I know you will make me chairs and
table of sorts saw or no aye if our table be but a board laid across
stones and our chairs the same

What more do we need says I sighing and scowling at my hatchet that
it was not a saw

Well Martin if there be many goats in the island and if you could
take two or three alive I have been thinking we might use their milk
in many ways if we had pans to put the milk in as butter and cheese if
you could make me a press Here be aplenty of ifs Martin and I
should not waste breath with so many if you were not the man you are

As how I questioned beginning to grind the hatchet on a stone

A man strong to overcome difficulty And with such clever hands

Here I ground my hatchet harder than before but scowled at it no
longer

And what more would you have I questioned

If you could make our front door to open and shut

That is easily done And what else beside

Nay here is enough for the present We are like to be very busy
people Martin

Why twill pass the time says I

And work is a very good thing quoth she thoughtfully

It is says I grinding away at my hatchet again

O Martin sighs she after awhile I grow impatient to explore our
island

And so you shall so soon as you are strong enough

And that will be very soon says she The seawater is life to me
and what with this sweet air I grow stronger every day

Meantime there is much to be done and here sit I in idleness

Nay you are sharpening your axe and I am talking to you and wondering
what you will make next

A lamp says I

How Martin

With a shell the fat of our goat rendered down and cotton from my
shirt

Nay if you so yearn for a lamp I can do this much

Good says I rising Meantime Ill turn carpenter and to begin
with try my hand at a stool for you

But if you have no saw Martin

I will make me a chisel instead Crossing to the fire I found my
iron redhot and taking it betwixt two flat pieces of wood that served
me for tongs I laid it upon my stone anvil and fell forthwith to
beating and shaping it with the hammerback of my hatchet until I had
beaten out a blade some two inches wide Having cooled my chisel in the
brook I betook me to sharpening it on a stone moistened with water and
soon had wrought it to a good edge I now selected from my timber a
board sufficiently wide and laying this on my anvilstone began to cut
a piece from the plank with hammer and chisel the which I found a work
requiring great care lest I split my wood and patience since my
chisel being of iron needed much and repeated grinding Howbeit it
was done at last and the result of my labour a piece of wood about two
feet square and behold the seat of my stool

Now was my companion idle for while all this is adoing she sets the
turtleshell on the fire with water and collops of meat cut with my
knife and soon as it simmers breaks into it divers herbs she had
dried in the sun and so comes to watch and question me at my work yet
turning ever and anon to stir at the stew with her new spoon whereby
I soon began to snuff a savour methought right appetising As time
passed this savour grew ever more inviting and my hunger with it my
mouth awatering so that I might scarce endure as I told her to her no
small pleasure

Had I but a handful of salt Martin sighs she

Why comrade says I pausing twixt two hammerstrokes Wherefore
this despond If you can make stew so savoury and with nought but
flesh of an old goat and a few dried herbs what matter for salt At
this she laughed and bent to stir at her stew again

Theres plenty of salt in the sea yonder says she presently

True but how to come at it

How if we boiled seawater Martin

Tis method unknown to me says I whittling at a leg of my stool
but we can try

And now in the seat of my stool I burned three goodsized holes or
sockets and having trimmed three lengths of wood I fitted these into
my socketholes and there was my stool complete This done I must
needs call her from her cooking to behold it and though it was no more
than a square of roughish wood set upon three pegs she praised and
viewed it as it had been a great elbow chair and cushioned at that
Hereupon puffed up with my success I must immediately begin to think
upon building us a table and chairs but being summoned to dinner I
obeyed her gladly enough And she seated on her stool with me on the
ground beside her and our turtleshell dish before us we ate with
hearty goodwill until our hunger appeased we fell to talk

She Tis marvellous how well I eat

Myself Tis the open air

She And the work Martin I have swept and dusted our cottage every
hole and corner

Myself And found nothing left by its last tenant

She Nothing

Myself Had he but thought to leave us a saw our chairs and table
would have been the better

She Then you will make them Martin

Myself Ayewith time

She O tis bravely determined

And here for a moment I felt the light touch of her hand on my
shoulder

Myself They will be very unlovely thingsvery rough

She And very wonderful Martin

Myself As to these goats now tis an excellent thought to catch some
alive and rear them

She I could make you excellent cheese and butter

Myself If I cannot run them down I must contrive to wound one or two
with arrows

She Why then Martin why not head your arrows with pebbles in place
of iron points

Myself Good again Or I might make a couple of gins running nooses
cut from the goatskin Howbeit Ill try

Herewith I arose and she also then while she busied herself to scald
out our turtleshell I set off to get my goatskin And finding it
where I had left it hanging on a rock to dry I fell acursing to
myself for very chagrin for what with the heat of the rock and the
fierce glare of the sun here was my goatskin all shrivelled and hard
as any board So stood I scowling at the thing chin in hand and
mightily cast down and so she presently found me and beholding my
disconsolate look falls alaughing

O Martin says she tis well there are some things you cannot do
Saying which she takes up the skin albeit it smelt none too sweet
and away she goes with it into the cave So I got me back to my
carpentry and selecting as many boards as I required for the width of
my table fell to cutting them to their proper lengths with hammer and
chisel And despite the shade of the mighty trees that girt us round
and the soft wind that stirred plaguy hot work I found it but ever
and anon she would bring me water in one of our shells cool from the
spring or would sit beside me as I laboured aiding me in a thousand
ways and showing herself vastly capable and quickwitted thus as the
sun sank westwards I had all my boards cut to an even size and two of
the legs though these being square I must needs chop asunder with
the hatchet yet I persevered being minded to complete the work ere
nightfall if possible

But where are your nails says she where she sat watching

Our nails be too few and precious quoth I pausing to resharpen my
hatchet I shall burn holes and pin our table together with pegs

Why then says she readily let me split and shape you some pegs

Spoke like a true comrade says I impulsively Sometimes I do
forget you are

A woman she questioned as I paused and I wondered to see her eyes
so bright and shining Here is twice you have named me your comrade
Martin and so will I be so long as I may You sometimes would call me
your comrade when we played together years ago and tis a good name
Martin Come now teach me how I must make these pegs for our table
So I showed her how to split divers lengths of wood and shape these as
round and smooth as might be the while I bored holes for them with a
heated iron and thus we sat side by side at our labour seldom
speaking yet I for one very well content

At length with her assistance I began setting the framework of our
table together joining and pinning it with my wooden pegs driven
mighty secure last of all I laid the boards across and pinning these
in place there was our table and though it was rude and primitive so
far as looks went yet very serviceable we were to find it

Well Martin says she when I had borne it into our cave methinks
my shelves and cupboard are none so far to seek Here she falls to
patting this unlovely thing and viewing it as it were the wonder of the
world and I must needs leap upon it to prove its strength

Tis overheavy says I giving it a final shake but twill serve

To admiration says she smoothing its rough surface with gentle
hand Tonight we will sup from it Which reminds me that supper is
to cook and our meat nearly all gone Martin though we have plenty of
plantains left So I told her I would go fetch what remained of the
carcass after supper so soon as the moon rose And now whiles she
bustled to and fro I chose me a little piece of wood and sitting
where I might watch her at her labours began to carve her the hair pin
I had promised

Our third cave should make us a very good larder says she busy at
her new table preparing supper

Aye

Tis so marvellous cool

Aye

I think because the pool lieth above it

Mayhap

Indeed these are wonderful caves Martin

They are

Who lived here before us I wonder

Penfeather like as not

Why should you think this

Well that door yonder was never a carpenters work yet tis well
made and furnished with a loophole narrow and horizontal to give a
lateral fire the which I have seen but once ere this Then again the
timbers of this door do carry many marks of shot and Adam Penfeather
is no stranger to such violence and danger steel and bullet seem to
follow him

Why so Martin He hath ever seemed a man very quiet and gentle most
unlike such rough sailormen as I have seen hitherto

True says I but neath this attitude of mind is a wily cunning and
desperate bloodthirsty courage and determination worthy any pirate or
buccaneer of them all

Why courage and determination are good things Martin And as for
Master Penfeather he is as I do know a skilful navigator and very well
read more especially in the Scriptures and methought your friend

For his own purposes quoth I

And what are these Martin

At this I merely scowled at the wood I was carving whereupon she
questions me further

Master Adam is such a grave and sober man

True says I

And so wise in counsel

Say rather cunning

Though to be sure he once had a poor man beaten cruelly

Wherein he was exactly right says I grinding my teeth at memory of
Red Andy Aye there Penfeather was very right this fellow was a
vile and beastly rogue

What dreadful thing had he done Martin

Stared at you says I and stopped and glancing up found her
regarding me with look mighty strange

Did you mind so much she questioned

No whit madam Why should I

Aye why indeed says she and turns to her cooking again and I to my
carving yet in a little hearing her gasp I glanced up to find her
nigh stifled with her laughter

Ha why must ye laugh madam I demanded

O Martin says she And must this poor man be whippedand for a
mere look And you so fierce withal I fear there be many men do
merit whipping if this be sin so great

I see no reason in your laughter my lady quoth I scowling up at
her

Because you have no gift of laughter my lord says she and turns
her back on me

Here I came nigh to tossing her halffinished hairpin into the fire
but seeing her turn her head carved on for very shame

And are you so very angry Martin I bent to sharpen my knife I
would that you might laugh yourselfonce in a while Martin I tested
my knife on my thumb You are always so grave Martin so very solemn
and young Finding my knife still blunt I went on sharpening it
Here and all suddenly she was beside me on her knees and clasps my
knifehand in hers Indeed I had no thought to anger you Are you
truly angered or is it only that you are so veryhungry Now here I
glanced at her and beholding all the roguish mischief in her eyes try
how I might I could not but smile too

A little of both comrade says I Though verily I am a surly
animal by nature

Indeed yes Martin she sighs yet a very comfortable animal and
though strong and fierce and woefully trying at times a very gentle
animal to such as know you

And do you know me so well

Better than you think O a great deal better Because I am a woman
And now are we friends again

Yes says I heartily Yes And away she goes to her cooking and I
mighty glad I had not destroyed her hairpin the which my knife being
sharp I began to ornament with all sorts of elaborations Presently
back she comes spoon in one hand stool in the other and sits to
watch me at work

What do you make now Martin

A pin for your hair

Why tis beautiful

Tis scarce begun yet

Here she must needs lavish all manner of praises on my skill until I
came nigh cutting myself

How many will you make me Martin

As many as you will

Three should suffice

Why you have a prodigious lot of hair

Do you think so Martin says she glancing down at the two great
braids that fell over her bosom wellnigh to her waist Twas well
enough in England but here tis greatly in my way and hampers me in my
work I had thought of cutting it off

Then dont

Why not Martin

Well says I glancing at the nearest braid that showed coppery
lights where the setting sun caught it Well because and finding
nought else to say I fell to my carving again and away she goes to her
cooking

Martin says she at last what do you know of Master Penfeather
Where did you fall in with him and why is his life so threatened

All by reason of Black Bartlemys treasure

Treasure says she and back she comes and onto her stool all in a
moment Tell me of it Martin

Tis a great treasure of gold and jewels in such

And who is Black Bartlemy

A foul rogue of a pirate that was killed by a poor Spanish lady and
lieth buried with her under the great pimento tree on the beach yonder

O Martin says she getting up that she might behold the tree O
Martin I knew I knew twas an evil place And the poor lady died
too

He killed her after she had stabbed him

How do you know of this

Adam Penfeather told me he saw it done Hereupon she sits down and
is silent awhile

And where is this great treasure

On this island

Here says she starting to her feet again Here Martin

Aye twas this I was despatched to secure after I had been rapped
over the head with a pistolbutt

And how must you find it

I never shall the secret of it was in the packet I tossed overboard
Adam may find it himself an he will

And you have no desire for this treasure

None in the world And now at her earnest solicitation I told her
all my association with Adam of my haunted days and nights aboard ship
and my suspicions of Tressady only I spoke nothing of Adams avowed
intent to steal the Faithful Friend to his own purposes

O wonderful says she when I had done and then again O wonderful
So this was why we were cut adrift Truly Master Penfeather hath quick
and subtle wits

A guileful rogueand very wily says I clenching my fist

But wherein is he rogue Martin

How quoth I was it not a wicked vile and most roguish act to set
you adrift thus to run the peril of sea and a desolate island

What other could he do Martin and the ship good as taken by the
mutineers I heard them shoutingfor me and here she shivered
True we have faced perils have lost all our stores but at least
here am Isafe with you Martin Saying which she rose and presently
summoned me to our evening meal

Having supped I took beneath my arm my rusty sword the which I had
sharpened and burnished as well as I might being minded to fetch what
remained of our goat but now she comes very earnest to go with me
and I agreeing readily enough we set out together forthwith



CHAPTER XXIX

OF MY ENCOUNTER BENEATH BARTLEMYS TREE

The moon was very bright casting great black shadows athwart our way
and now once our familiar surroundings were left behind we fell
silent or spake only in low voices awed by the universal hush of all
things for the night was very still and hot and breathless not a leaf
stirred and no sound to hear save the unceasing roar of the surf

Martin says she very softly here is a night of such infinite
quiet that I grow almost afraid

Of what I demanded pausing to look down on her where she limped
beside me And then twixt my teeth Is it me you fear

Ah no no cries she slipping her hand within my arm Never never
that you foolish Martin And here she looks at me with such a smile
that I must needs glance otherwhere yet methought her cheeks showed
pale in the moonlight

Why then whats amiss I questioned as we went on again and I very
conscious of her hand yet upon my arm

I know not she sighed tis the stillness mayhap the loneliness
and dreadful solitude I feel as though some danger threatened

A storm belike says I glancing round about us and across the
placid sea

O Martin tis hateful to be a woman Why should I fear thus and no
reason tis folly And here she must pause to stamp her foot at
herself And yet I do fear says she after a while O Martin glad
am I to have man like you beside me

Though another man might serve as well says I Of course

Of course Martin

At this I turned to scowl at the placid sea again

Any man says I at last

O Martin nohow foolish under growany man might be evil as Black
Bartlemy

Ive heard I am much like him in looks

But then you are Martin and he wasBlack Bartlemy

After this we were silent a great while nor spoke again until we had
traversed the whole length of Deliverance Sands then

What manner of man I demanded

Now at this she turns to look at me and I saw their lips quiver to a
little smile that came but to vanish again

Something your sort Martin but without your gloom and evil tempers
and one who could laugh betimes

Sir Rupert quoth I

He was very gay and merryhearted says she

Yet suffered you to be beguiled and cast adrift to your great peril

But stayed to do his share of the fighting Martin

Ha says I scowling Tis great pity we may not change places he
and I

Would you change places with himwillingly Martin


AyeI would so At this she whipped her hand from my arm and turned
to frown up at me whiles I scowled sullenly on her

Why then Master Conisby says she I would you were anywhere but
here And know thiswhen you scowl so all sulleneyed I know you
for the very image of Black Bartlemy

Now as she spake thus we were standing almost in the very shadow of
that tall pimento tree beneath which Bartlemy had laughed and died and
now from this gloomy shadow came something that whirred by my ear and
was gone But in that moment I had swept my companion behind a rock
and with sword advanced leapt straight for the tree and there in the
halflight came on a fantastic shape and closed with it in deadly
grapple My rusty sword had snapped short at the first onset yet
twice I smote with the broken blade while arm locked with arm we
writhed and twisted To and fro we staggered and so out into the
moonlight and I saw my opponent for an Indian His long hair was
bound by a fillet that bore a feather a feather cloak was about him
this much I saw as we strove together Twice he broke my hold and
twice I grappled him and ever we strove more fiercely he with his
knife and I with my broken sword and once I felt the searing pain of a
wound And now as we swayed locked together thus I saw over his
bowed shoulder my lady where she crouched against a rock to watch us
and knowing myself hurt and my opponent very mighty and strong great
fear seized me

Run Joan cried I gasping O Damarisrun back

Never Martinnever without you If you must dieI come with you

Mightily heartened by her voice I strove desperately to secure the hold
I sought but my antagonist was supple as any eel moreover his skin
was greased after the manner of Indian warriors but in our struggling
we had come nigh to the rock where crouched my lady and biding my
time I let go my broken sword and seizing him by a sort of collar he
wore I whirled him backward against the rock saw his knife fly from
his hold at the impact felt his body relax and grow limp and then as
my grasp loosened staggered back from a blow of his knee and saw him
leap for the lagoon But I being greatly minded to make an end of him
and for good reasons set after him hotfoot and so came running hard
behind him to the reef here the way being difficult I must needs
slack my pace but he surer footed ran fleetly enough until he was
gotten wellnigh to the middle of the reef there for a moment he
paused and looking back on me where I held on in pursuit I saw his
dark face darker for a great splash of blood suddenly he raised one
hand aloft shaking it to and fro and so vanished down the rocks
When I came there it was to behold him paddling away in a long piragua
Panting I stood to watch and yearning for a bow or firelock until his
boat was hardly to be seen amid the moonlit ripples that furrowed the
placid waters yet still I watched but feeling at hand touch me
turned to find my lady beside me

Martin says she looking up at me greateyed O Martin you are
wounded Come let me cherish your hurts

Why Damaris says I yet panting with my running You said this to
me when I fought the big village boy years agone

Come Martin you are bleeding

Nought to matter  and I let him go  to bring others like enough
 tomorrow I will make my bow  nay  I can walk But now
indeed sea and rocks grew all blurred and misty on my sight and twice
I must needs rest awhile ere we came on Deliverance Sands And so
homewards a weary journey whereof I remember nothing save that I fell
agrieving that I had suffered this Indian to escape

So came we to the plateau at last her arm about me and mine upon her
shoulders and angered at my weakness I strove to go alone yet reeled
in my gait like a drunken man and so suffered her to get me into our
cave as she would Being upon my bed she brings the lamp and kneeling
by me would examine my hurt whether I would or no and I being weak
off came my shirt And then I heard her give a little gasping cry

Is it so bad says I finding my tongue more unready than usual

Nay tis notnot yourwound Martin

Then what

Your poor backall these cruel scars O Martin

Nought but the lash They whipped us well aboard the Esmeralda
galleass In a while I was aware of her soft gentle hands as she
bathed me with water cool from the spring thereafter she made a
compress of moss and leaves and laying it to my wound bound it there
as well as she might the which I found very grateful and comforting
This done she sits close beside me to hush and soothe me to sleep as I
had been a sick child And I lying twixt sleep and wake knew I
might not rest until I told her what I had in mind

Damaris says I this night I lied to you  I would not have
another man in my place  now or  ever and so sank to sleep



CHAPTER XXX

OF MY SICK HUMOURS

Next day I awoke early and my wound very painful and troublesome this
notwithstanding I presently got me out into the early sunshine and to
my wonder found the fire already lighted and no sign of my companion
Hereupon I fell to shouting and hallooing but getting no answer sat
me down mighty doleful and seeing her stool where it stood straddled
on its three legs I cursed it for its unsightliness and turned my back
on it And now crouched in the sunlight I grew mightily sorry for
myself thus solitary and deserted and the hurt in my shoulder all on
fire And in a little my selflove gave place to a fretful unease so
that I must needs shout her name again and again listening for sound
of her voice for some rustle to tell me she was nigh but heard only
the faint booming of the surf So I arose and albeit I found my legs
mighty unwilling came out upon the plateau but look how and where I
might saw only a desolation of sea and beach whereupon being greatly
disquieted I set out minded to seek her By the time I reached
Deliverance the sun was well up its heat causing my wound to throb and
itch intolerably and I very fretful and peevish But as I tramped on
and no trace of her I needs must remember how I had sought her
hereabouts when I had thought her dead whereupon a great and
unreasoning panic seized me and I began to run And then all at
once I spied her She was sitting upon a rock her head bowed wearily
upon her hands and seeing how her shoulders heaved I knew she was
bitterly aweeping Therefore I stopped and glancing from her
desolate figure round about upon her desolate surroundings knew this
grim solitude for the reason of her tears At this thought a wave of
hot anger swept over me and a rage that like my panic reasoned not
as clenching my fists I strode on Suddenly she looked up and seeing
me rose at once and lifting the great turtleshell limped wearily
towards me with this borne before her

Ha says I viewing her tearwet cheeks as she came must ye weep
madam must ye weep

May I not weep Martin says she head pitifully adroop Come let
us go back you look very pale twas wrong of you to come so far
Here is our breakfast tis the best I can find And she showed me a
few poor shellfish

Give me the turtleshell says I

Indeed I can bear it very easily Martin And you so white and
haggardyour wound is troubling you Come let me bathe it

Give me the turtleshell

No Martin be wise and let us

Will you gainsay medye defy me

O Martin no but you are so weak

Weak Am I so And stooping I caught her up in my arms upsetting
the turtleshell and spilling the result of her labours So with her
crushed to me I turned and set off along the beach and she lying thus
helpless must needs fall to weeping again and I in my selfish and
blind folly to plaguing the sweet soul therewith as

England is far away my Lady Joan Here be no courtly swains no
perfumed mincing lovers to sigh and bow and languish for you Here
is Solitude lady Desolation hath you fast and is not like to let you
gohere mayhap shall you liveand die An ill place this and like
nature strong and cruel An ill place and an ill rogue for company
You named me rogue once and rogue forsooth you find me England is far
awaybut Godis farther

Thus I babbled scowling down on her as I bore her on until my breath
came in great gasps until the sweat poured from me until I sank to my
knees and striving to rise found I might not and glaring wildly up saw
we were come neath Bartlemys cursed pimento tree Then she loosing
herself from my fainting arms bent down to push the matted hair from
my eyes to support my failing strength in tender arms and to lower my
heavy head to her knee

Foolish child she murmured Poor foolish child England is very
far I know but this I know also Martin God is all about us and here
in our loneliness within these great solitudes doth walk beside us

Yet you weep says I

Aye I did Martin

Becauseof theloneliness

No Martin

Yourlost friends

No Martin

Thenwherefore

O trouble not for thing so small a womans tears come easily they
say

Not yours Joan Yet you wept

Your wound bleeds afresh lie you there and stir not till I bring
water to bathe it And away she hastes and I burning in a fever of
doubt and questioning must needs lie there and watch her bring the
turtleshell to fill it at the little rill that bubbled in that rocky
cleft as I have described before While this was adoing I stared up
at the pimento tree and bethinking me of Black Bartlemy and the poor
Spanish lady and of my hateful dream I felt sudden great shame for
here had I crushed my lady in arms as cruel wellnigh as his This put
me to such remorse that I might not lie still and strove to rise up
yet got no further than my knees and twas thus she found me And now
when I would have sued her forgiveness for my roughness she soothed me
with gentle words though what she spake I knew not and gave me to
drink and so fell to cherishing my hurt until my strength coming back
somewhat I got to my feet and suffered her to bring me where she
would speaking no word since in my fevered brain I was asking myself
this question viz

Why must she weep

Now whether the Indians knife was poisoned or no I cannot say but for
two days I lay direly sick and scarce able to crawl conscious only of
the soothing tones of her voice and touch of her hands But upon the
third day opening my eyes I found myself greatly better though
marvellous weak And as I stirred she was beside me on her knees

Drink this Martin says she And I obeying found it was excellent
broth And when I had drunk all I closed my eyes mighty content and
so lay a while

My Lady Joan says I at last wherefore did you weep

O Martin she sighed Twas because that morning I had sought so
long and found so little to give you and you so sick Here was
silence a while

But whence cometh the broth quoth I at last

I caught a young goat Martin in a noose of hide set among the rocks
and thenthen I had to kill itO Martin

Youcaught andkilled a goat

Yes Martin You had to be fedbut O the poor thing

Surely said I at last O surely never had man so brave a comrade as
I How may I ever show you all my gratitude

By going to sleep Martin Your wound is wellnigh healed sleep is
all you need And sleep I did though at that time and for many
nights to come my slumber was haunted by a fear that the Indian was
back again and others with him all stealing upon us to our torment
and destruction But in this night I awoke parched with thirst and the
night very hot and with the moon making pale glory all about me So I
got to my feet albeit with much ado being yet very feeble when her
voice reached me

What is it Martin Are you thirsty

Beyond enduring says I

Bide you still she commanded and next moment she flits softfooted
into the moonlight with one of our larger shells to bring me water from
the rill near by but seeing me on my feet looks on me gladeyed then
shakes reproving head

Lie you down says she mighty serious Lie you down

Nay Ill go myself But she was past me and out of the cave or
ever I might stay her but scarce had I seated myself upon my bed than
she was back again the shell brimming in her hands so I drank eagerly
enough but with my gaze on the sheen of white rounded arm and dimpled
shoulder Having emptied the shell I stooped to set it by and when I
looked again she had vanished into her own small cave

I am glad you are so greatly better Martin says she from the dark

Indeed I am well again quoth I Tomorrow I make my bow and
arrows Had I done this before the Indian should never have got away

Think you he will return and with others Martin

No says I albeit my mind misgave me Yet tis best to be
prepared so I will have a good stout pike also in place of my broken
sword

And strengthen our door Martin

Aye I will so tis a mighty stout door thank God

Thank God says she mighty reverent And now go to sleep Martin
So here was silence wherein I could hear the murmur of the breakers
afar and the soft bubbling of the rill hard by and yet sleep I could
not

And you caught and killed a goat says I

Nay Martin tis a horror I would forget

And you did it that I might eat

Yes Martin And now hush thee

Though indeed says I in a little thus much you would have done for
any man to be sure

To be sure Martinunless he were man like Black Bartlemy Goodnight
and close your eyes Are they shut

Yes says I Goodnight to thee comrade



CHAPTER XXXI

I TRY MY HAND AT POTTERY

Next morning having bathed me in the pool I descended thence to find
breakfast acooking two noble steaks propped before the fire on
skewers stuck upright in the ground a device methought very ingenious
and told her so the which did seem to please her mightily

Are you hungry Martin

Tis a poor word for it says I sniffing at the roasting steaks

Alas Our poor turtleshell is all perished with the fire Martin if
you could but contrive me a pan with handles I have found plenty of
clay along the river bank yonder Here she gives me my steak on a
piece of wood for platter and I being so sharpset must needs burn my
mouth in my eagerness whereon she gravely reproves me as I had been a
ravenous boy yet laughs thereafter to see me eat with such huge
appetite now a bite of plantain and now a slice of steak cut with my
knife

As to your pan with handles says I my hunger appeased somewhat I
will set about it as soon as I have made my bow and arrows

There is no need of them quoth she and rising away she goes and
presently comes back with a goodly bow and quiver full of arrows

Lord love you says I leaping up in my eagerness Heres mighty
good weapon As indeed it was being longer than most Indian bows and
of good power Moreover it was tufted with feathers rare to fancy and
garnished here and there with fillets of goldwork very artificially
wrought as were also the arrows Nine of these there were in a quiver
of tanned leather adorned with featherwork and gold beads so that I
did not doubt but that their late owner had been of some account among
his fellows

I found them two days ago Martin but kept them until you should be
well again And this I found too And she showed me a gold collar of
twisted wire delicately wrought All of the which put me in high good
humour and I was minded to set off there and then to try a shot at
something but she prevailed upon me to finish my meal first the which
I did though hastily

There was a knife also says I suddenly

Yes Martin but I threw it into the lagoon

O folly says I

Nay we have two knives already and this as I do think was poisoned

No matter twas a goodly knifewhy must you throw it away

Because I was so minded says she mighty serene and regarding me
with her calm level gaze Never scowl Martin though indeed twas
goodly knife with handle all goldwork At this I scowled the more
and she must needs laugh calling me Black Bartlemy whereon I turned
my back on her and she fell asinging to herself

Think you these arrows are poisoned also says she as I rose At
this I emptied them from the quiver and though their iron barbs
looked innocent enough I held each in the fire until I judged I had
rendered them harmless if poisoned they were indeed

And now though sore tempted to try my skill with this good bow I
followed her down to the riverbank to try my hand at pottery though
taking good care to carry my bow with me

Being come to the river I laid aside bow and quiver and cutting divers
lumps of clay the which seemed very proper to my purpose I fell to
kneading these lumps until I had wrought them to a plastic consistency
and so keeping my hands continually moistened I began to mould and
shape a pot to her directions And now since I was about it I
determined to have as many as need be and of different sizes My first
was a great illlooking thing and my second little better but as I
progressed I grew more skilful so that after some while I had six pots
of varying size and shape and each with handles and though ill
things to look at my lady found them all she desired

Surely they are very clumsy says I viewing them doubtfully

But very strong Martin

And very ponderous

But they have handles Martin

And very illshaped

Tis no matter so long as they will hold water Martin

Hereupon heartened by her encouragement I tried my hand at a set of
dishes platters and the like for as I grew more expert at the art my
interest increased So I laboured all the morning working neath a
tree upon the riverbank and my pots set out to dry in the full glare
of the sun all of a row and I in my heart not a little proud of
them But turning to look at them after some while I saw divers of
them beginning to crack and gape here and there with the suns heat
whereon my vain pride gave place to sudden petulant anger and leaping
up I demolished them one and all with a couple of savage kicks

O Martin cries my lady desponding Is all your labour wasted Are
you done

No says I clenching my teeth I begin now And down I sat to my
claykneading again But this time I worked it more thoroughly and so
began to mould my pots and pipkins over again and she aiding me as
well as she might This time the thing came easier at the which my
companion did admire and very full of encouragement as the vessels took
shape under my hands

Come Martin says she at last tis dinnertime

No matter quoth I

Will you not eat

No says I mighty determined Here sit I nor will I go eat till I
can contrive you a pot worthy the name And I bent to my work again
but missing her from beside me turned to see her seated upon the
grassy bank and with two roasted steaks set out upon two great green
leaves a delectable sight

Pray lend me your knife Martin

What have you brought dinner hither says I

To be sure Martin

Why then says I and laving the clay from my hands came beside her
and using our knife alternately a very pleasant meal we made of it

All that afternoon I wrought at our pots until I had made a dozen or so
of all sizes and each and every furnished with one or more handles
and though I scowled at a crack here and there they looked none the
less serviceable on the whole and hardening apace

And now comrade quoth I rising now we will fire them So
having collected wood sufficient I reached for my biggest pot the
which being made first was the hardestset and taking it up with
infinite care off tumbled the handles At this I was minded to dash
the thing to pieces but her touch restrained me and I set it down
staring at it mighty discomfited and downcast whereat she laughs right
merrily

O Martin says she never gloom so tis an excellent pot even
without handles indeed I do prefer it so

No says I handles you wanted and handles you shall have So
taking a stick that lay handy I sharpened it to a point and therewith
bored me two holes beneath the lip of the pot and other two opposite
This pot shall have iron handle says I unless it perish in the
fire Then setting the pots as close as might be I covered them with
brushwood and thereupon and with infinite caution builded a fire and
presently had it agoing Now I would have stayed to tend the fire but
my companion showed me the sun already low vowed I had done enough
that I was tired etc So having set upon the fire wood enough to
burn good time I turned away and found myself weary even as she said

Goatsflesh says I as we sat side by side after supper
goatsflesh is an excellent wholesome diet and as you cook it
delicious

Tis kind of you to say so Martin but

We have had it says I we have had it boiled and baked

And roast and stewed and broiled across your iron bolts Martin and
yet tis always goatsflesh and I do yearn for a change and so do
you

Lord says I You do read my very thoughts sometimes

Is that so wonderful Martin

Why a mans thoughts are but thoughts says I watching where she
braided a long tress of her hair

Some mens thoughts are so easily read says she

Are mine

Sometimes Martin Now at this I blenched and well I might and she
smiled down at the long tress of hair she was braiding and then glances
at me mighty demure quoth she But only sometimes Martin Now for
instance you are wondering why of late I have taken to wearing my hair
twisted round my head and pinned with these two small pieces of wood in
fashion so unsightly

Aye truly says I wondering indeed and so I was Though I do not
think it unsightly

I wear it so Martin first because my hairpins are yet to make and
second because I would not have you find my hairs in your baked goat
boiled goat roast fried or stewed goat And speaking of goat brings
us back where we began and we began yearning for a change of food

As to that says I taking her halffinished hairpin from my pocket
and drawing my knife the lagoon is full of fish had I but a hook

Or a net Martin

How should we contrive our net

In the woods all about us do grow vines very strong and pliablewould
these serve think you

Haan excellent thought says I Tomorrow we will attempt it As
to fishhooks I might contrive them out of my nails hammered small
though I fear theyd be but clumsy Had I but a good stout pin

I have two Martin here in my shoebuckles

Show me Stooping she slipped off one of her shoes and gave it to
me and turning it over in my hand I saw the poor little thing all cut
and torn and in woeful estate

I must contrive you other shoes and soon says I

Can you make shoes Martin

Ill tell you this tomorrow

O Martin twould be wonderful if you could and a great comfort to
me

Why then you shall have them though unlovely things theyll be I
fear

No matter so long as they keep out sharp stones and briars Martin

Your foot is wonderfully small says I studying her shoe

Is it Martin Why tis a very ordinary foot I think And the pins
are behind the buckles Sure enough I found these silver buckles
furnished each with a good stout pin wellsuited to my design so
breaking them from the buckles I had soon bent them into hooks and
with the back of my knife and a stone I shaped each with a small ring
atop whereby I might secure them to my line and though they had no
barbs I thought they might catch any fish were I quick enough

How shall you do for a line Martin

I shall take the gut of one of our goats and worsted unravelled from
my stocking

Will worsted be strong enough

I shall make it fourfold

Nay I will plait it into a line for you

Good quoth I And whipping off one of my stockings I unravelled
therefrom sufficient of the worsted

But what shall you do for stockings says she while this was adoing

I will make me leggings of goatsskin So she took the worsted and
now sitting in a patch of radiant moonlight fell to work she weaving
our fishline with fingers very quick and dexterous and I carving away
at the pin for her hair

How old are you Martin says she suddenly

Twentyseven

And I shall be twentysix tomorrow

I judged you older

Do I look it Martin

Yesno no

Meaning what Martin

You do seem older being no silly maid but of a constant mind and one
to endure hardship Also you are very brave in peril very courageous
and highhearted Moreover you are wise

Do you think me all this says she softly And wherefore

I have never heard you complain yetsave of me and I have never seen
you afraid Moreover you caught a goat and killed it

You are like to make me vain of my so many virtues Martin laughs
she yet her laugh was very soft and her eyes kind when she looked at
me

This hairpin shall be my birthday gift to you says I

And surely none like to it in the whole world Martin

After this we worked a great while speaking no word but presently she
shows me my fishline very neatly plaited and a good five feet long
the which did please me mightily and so I told her

Heigho says she leaning back against the rock Our days grow ever
more busy

And will do quoth I Here is strange rude life for you days of
hardship and labour unceasing Your hands shall grow all hard and
rough and yourself sick with longing to be hence

Alas poor me she sighed

Why twill be no wonder if you grieve for England and ease says I
twill be but natural

O very Martin

For here are you I went on beginning to scowl up at the waning
moon here are you bred up to soft and silken comfort very dainty and
delicate and belike with lovers aplenty courtly gallants full up of
fine phrases and eager for your service

Well Martin

Instead of the which you have this island

An earthly paradise says she

And myself

A foolish being and gloomy says she One that loveth to be woeful
and having nought to grieve him for the moment must needs seek
somewhat So will I to bed ere he find it

Look now quoth I as she rose in losing the world you do lose
everything

And you also Martin

Nay says I in losing the world of yesterday I may find more than
ever I possessed

Meaning you are content Martin

Is anyone ever content in this world

WellImight be says she slowly But youI do fear you will
never know true content it is not in you I think

And off she goes to bed leaving me very full of thought Howbeit the
moon being very bright though on the wane I stayed there until I had
finished her hairpin of the which I give here a cut viz

Sketch of a hairpin



CHAPTER XXXII

TELLS HOW I FOUND A SECRET CAVE

Next morning I was up mighty early and away to the little valley first
to view my pots and then to pick some flowers for her birthday
remembering her great love for such toys Coming to the ashes of the
fire I must needs fall acursing most vilely like the ill fellow I
was and to swearing many great and vain oaths and it her birthday
For here were my pots what the fire had left of them all swollen and
bulged with the heat warped and misshapen beyond imagining

So I stood plucking my beard and cursing them severally and all
together and fetched the nearest a kick that nigh broke my toe and set
the pot leaping and bounding a couple of yards but all unbroken
Going to it I took it up and found it not so much as scratched and hard
as any stone This comforted me somewhat and made me to regret my ill
language more especially having regard to this day being as it were a
day apart And now as I went on crossing the stream at a place where
were steppingstones set there by other hands than mine as I went I
say I must needs think what a surly illmannered fellow I was
contrasting the gross man I was become with the gentle sweetnatured
lad I had been Well but thinks I excusing myself the
plantations and a rowingbench be a school where a man is apt to learn
nought but evil and brutality my wrongs have made me what I am But
again thinks Iblaming myself wrong and hardship cruelty and
suffering do not debase all men as witness the brave Frenchman that
was whipped to death beside me in the Esmeralda galleass Wrong and
suffering either lift a man to greatness or debase him to the very
brute She had said as much to me once And she was right thinks I
for the Frenchman had died the noble gentleman he was born whiles I
as wellborn as he and suffering no greater wrong than he according to
his own account I had sullied myself with all the vileness and filth
of slavedom had fought and rioted with the worst of them And now
remembering the shame of it all I sat me down in the shade of a tree
and fell to gloomy and sad reflection grieving sorely over things long
past and forgotten until now and very full of remorse and scorn of
myself

Howbeit thinks I if rogue and brute I am which is beyond all
doubt I will keep such for my own kind and she shall know nought of
it And here getting upon my knees I took a great and solemn oath to
this effect viz Never by look or word or gesture to give her
cause for shame or fear so long as we should abide together in this
solitude so aid me God This done I arose from my knees and betook me
to culling flowers great silver lilies and others of divers hues
being minded to lay them on the threshold of her door to greet her when
she should arise With these in my arms I recrossed the brook and
stepping out from a thicket came full upon her ere she was aware and
seeing her so suddenly I stood like any fool my poor flowers hidden
behind me She had taken up one of my misshapen pots and was patting it
softly as she viewed it and a little smile on her red lips All at
once she turned and spying me came towards me all smiling fresh and
radiant as the morning

O Martin says she turning the pot this way and that O Martin
tis wonderful

Tis an abomination quoth I

And twill hold water

Tis like an ill dream says I

And so strong Martin

True tis the only merit the things possess they are like
stonewatch now And here to prove my words I let one drop though
indeed I chose a soft place for it

And they will be so easy to carry with these handles andwhy what
have you there Saying which she sets down the pot gently as it had
been an eggshell and comes to me whereupon I showed her my posy and
I more foollike than ever

I chanced tosee them growing says I and thoughtyour
birthdaythey might pleasure you a little mayhap

Please me says she taking them Please meO the dear beautiful
things I love them And she buries her face among them Twas kind
of you to bring them for me Martin says she her face hidden in the
flowers Indeed you are very good to me After all you are that same
dear Martin I knew long ago that boy who used to brandish his rusty
sword and vow hed suffer no evil to come near me and yearned for
ogres and dragons to fight and slay on my behalf And one day you
caught a boy pulling my hair

It was very long hair even then says I

And he made your lip bleed Martin

And I hit him on the nose says I

And he ran away Martin

And you bathed my lip in the pool and afterwards youyou

Yes I did Martin Though tis a long time to remember

Ishall never forget says I Shall you

Here she buries her face in her flowers again

As to the pots Martin there are four quite unbroken will you help
me bear them to our refuge breakfast will be ready

Breakfast is a sweet word quoth I And as to these things if you
will have them well and good

And thus she with her flowers and I with the gallipots we came to our
habitation

What do we work at today she questioned as we rose from our morning
meal

Today I make you a pair of shoes

How may I aid you Martin

In a thousand ways says I and I plucked a great fanshaped leaf
that grew adjacent First sit you down And now give me your foot
So kneeling before her I traced out the shape of her foot upon the
leaf and got no further for a while so that presently she goes about
her household duties leaving me staring at my leaf and scratching my
head puzzling out how I must cut and shape my goatskin Wellnigh
all that morning I sat scheming and studying how best I might achieve
my purpose and the end of it was this

Sketch of a leaf cut to shape

This shape I cut from the leaf and with it went to find my lady then
she sitting upon the stool I took off one of her shoes and she all
laughing wonderment and fitting this pattern to her foot found it
well enough for shape though something too large I now took the
goatskin and laying it on the table cut therefrom a piece to my
pattern then with one of my nails ground to a sharp point like a
cobblers awl I pierced it with holes and sewed it together with gut
in this fashion

Four sketches of shaped hide showing stages of manufacture

This is quickly over in the telling but it was long adoing so that
having wrought steadily all day night was at hand ere her shoes were
completed with two thicknesses of hide for soles and all sewed mighty
secure

Now though they were not things of beauty as may plainly be seen from
my drawing herewith yet once I had laced them snug upon her feet
they shaping and moulding themselves to her slender ankles and dainty
feet were none so illlooking after all And now she walking to and
fro in them must needs admire at their construction and the comfort of
them and very lavish in her praise of them and me the which did
pleasure me mightily though I took pains to hide it

Why Martin says she thrusting out a foot and wagging it to and fro
very taking to behold I vow our cobbler surpasseth our carpenter
Dians buskins were no better nay not so good judging by pictures I
have seen

They will at least keep out any thorns says I though as to looks

They look what they are Martin the shoes of a huntress You will
find her very swift and surefooted when her bruises are quite gone

Im glad they please you says I yet upon my knees and stooping to
view them neath her petticoat though now I see I might better them
by trimming and shaping them here and there

No no Martin leave well alone

But now and all at once I started to feel a great splash of rain upon
my cheek and glancing up saw the sky all overcast while seaward the
whole horizon was very black and ominous great masses of writhing
vapour and these threatening clouds lit ever and anon by a reddish
glow and pierced by vivid lightning flashes All of which took us
mightily by surprise we having been too intent upon these new buskins
to heed aught else

Yonder is storm and tempest says I see how it sweeps towards us
And I pointed where far across the dark sea a line of foam marked the
oncoming fury of the wind And presently we heard it a faint hum
growing ever louder and fiercer

O Martin see yonder and she pointed to the onrushing of the foaming
waters Tis very awful but very grand

Let us go in says I catching up my tools Come soon will be
roaring havoc all about us

Nay let us stay awhile and watch

As she spoke it seemed as the sea gathered itself into one great and
mighty wave a huge wall of foaming waters that rolled onward hissing
and roaring as it would whelm the very island beneath it On it
rushed swelling ever higher and so burst in thunder upon the barrier
reef filling the air with whirling foam And thenthen came the
winda screaming howling vicious titan that hurled us flat and
pinned me breathless and scarce able to move howbeit I crawled where
she crouched somewhat sheltered by a rock and clasping her within my
arm lay there nor dared to stir until the mad fury of the wind abated
somewhat Then side by side on hands and knees we gained our rocky
fastness and closing the door which was screened from the direct
force of the tempest I barred it with the beam I had made for the
purpose and stood staring at my companion and she on me while all the
world about us roared and clamoured loud and louder until it seemed
here was to be an end of all things And now suddenly came darkness
and in this darkness her hand found mine and nestled there Thus we
remained a great while hearkening to the awful booming of this rushing
mighty wind a sound indescribable in itself yet one to shake the very
soul In a while the tumult subsiding a little we might distinguish
other sounds as the rolling of thunder the rending crash of falling
trees hard by and the roar of mighty waters And presently her voice
came to me

God pity all poor mariners Martin

Amen says I And needs must think of Adam and Godby and wonder
where they might be

Tis very dark shall we not have a light she questioned

If I can find our lamp says I groping about for it

Here is a candle

A candle says I And where should we find a candle

We have three Martin I made them with tallow from our goat though
they are poor things I fear

Taking out my tinderbox I very soon had these candles burning and
though they smoked somewhat a very excellent light we thought them
And now for supper says she beginning to bustle about Our meat
is in the larder Martin Now this larder was our third and smallest
cave and going therein I was immediately struck by the coldness of it
moreover the flame of the candle I bore flickered as in a draught of
air insomuch that forgetting the meat I began searching high and
low looking for some crack or crevice whence this draught issued yet
found none This set me to wondering for here was the cave some ten
feet by twelve or more and set deep within the living rock the walls
smoothed off here and there as by hand but with never a crack or
fissure in roof or walls so far as I might discover Yet was I
conscious of this cold breath of air so that my puzzlement grew the
greater

Presently as I stood thus staring about to me comes my lady

Good lack Martin says she if we sup on goat tonight we must eat
it raw for we have no fire

Fire says I Hum Smoke would do it tis an excellent thought

Do what Martin

Look at the candleflame and hark

And now the booming of the wind dying down somewhat we heard a
strange and dismal wailing and therewith a sound of water afar

O Martin she whispered clasping her hands and coming nearer to me
What is it

Nought to fear comrade But somewhere in this larder of ours is an
opening or fissure the question iswhere And this I go to find out

Aye but how she questioned coming nearer yet for now the wailing
had sunk to a groan and this gave place to a bubbling gasp mighty
unpleasant to hear

With smoke says I setting the candle in a niche of rock I will
light a fire here

But we have no fuel Martin

There is plenty in my bed

But how will you sleep and no bed

Well enough as I have done many a time and oft

But O Martin twill make such dire mess and this our larder

No matter Ill clean it up Howbeit I must learn whence cometh this
coldbreathing air Besides the fire shall cook our supper and
moreover

But here I checked speaking all at once for above the dismal groans
and wailing I had heard a sudden fierce whispering

O Martin O Martin sighed my companion We are not alonesomewhere
there are people whispering Did you hear Martin O did you hear
And I felt her all of atremble where she leaned against me

Tis gone now says I speaking under my breath

But twas there Martina hateful whispering

Aye I heard it says I fierce and loud and Ill find out who or
what

Who or what hissed a soft voice Hereupon I sheathed the knife I
had drawn and laughed and immediately there came another laugh though
very soft

Ahoy I shouted and presently back came the answer Ahoy and then
again though much fainter Ahoy Tis nought but an echo says I
laughing yet mighty relieved all the same

Thank God says she faintly and would have fallen but for my arm

Why comrade how now says I and for a moment her soft cheek rested
against my leathern jerkin

O Martin says she sighing I do fear me Im a monstrous
cravensometimes Forgive me

Forgive you says I and looking down on her bowed head feeling her
thus all atremble against me I fell astammering Forgive you
naywherehere was an unchancy thingtis small wonderno wonder
you should grow affrighted and tremble a little

You are trembling also says she her voice muffled against me

Am I

Yes Martin Were you afraid likewise

NoYes says I and feeling her stir in my hold I loosed her

And now bringing fern and bracken from my bed I kindled a fire and
damping this a little made a smoke the which rising to a certain
height blew back upon us but always from the one direction and
peering up thither I judged here must be a space twixt the roof and
the face of the rock though marvellous wellhid from all observation
Hereupon the place being full of smoke I must needs stamp out the fire
lest we stifle yet I had discovered what I sought So whilst my
companion busied herself about supper I dragged our table from the
outer cave setting it in a certain corner and mounted thereon
reached up and grasped a ledge of rock by which I drew myself up and
found I was in a narrow opening or tunnel and so low that I must creep
on hands and knees

Will you have a candle Martin And there was my lady standing below
me on the table all anxiouseyed So I took the candle and creeping
through this narrow passage suddenly found myself in another cavern
very spacious and lofty and now standing in this place I stared
about me very full of wonder as well I might be for I saw this
Before me a narrow door very stout and pierced with a loophole and
beyond this a rocky passage that led steeply down on my right hand
in a corner a rough bed with a bundle of goatskins and sheets that
looked like sailcloth on my left a table and armchair roughbuilded
like the bed and above these a row of shelves against the rocky wall
whereon stood three pipkins an iron threelegged cookingpot a
candlestick and an inkhorn with pen in it Lastly in a corner close
beside the bed I spied a longbarrelled firelock with bandoliers
complete I was about to reach this and very joyously when my ladys
voice arrested me

Martin are you there Are you safe

Indeed says I And Damaris I have found you treasure beyond
price

O Martin is it Bartlemys treasurethe jewels

Better than that a thousand times I have found you a real
cookingpot

O wonderful Show me Nay let me see for myself Come and aid me
up Martin

Setting down my candle I crawled back where she stood all eager
impatience and clasping her hands in mine drew her up and on hands
and knees brought her into the cave

Heres a goodly place comrade says I

Yes Martin

With a ladder to come and go by this should make you a noble
bedchamber

Never says she O never

And wherefore not

First because I like my little cave best and second because this is
too much like a dungeon and third because I like it notand hark
and indeed as we spoke the echoes hissed and whispered all about us

Why tis airy and very dry

And very dark by day Martin

True enough Still tis a wondrous place

O very Martin only I like it not at all

Why then the bed the bed should serve you handsomely

No says she mighty vehement You shall make me a better an you
will or I will do with my bed of fern

Well then this pothere is noble iron pot for you at least

Why yes says she smiling to see me all chapfallen tis indeed a
very good pot let us bring it away with us though indeed I could do
very well without it

Lord says I gloomily Here have I found you all these goodly
things not to mention chair and table thinking to please you and
instead

I know Martin forgive me but I love not the place nor anything in
it I am very foolish belike but so it is And here she must needs
shiver As to these things the bed the chair and table and the
shelves yonder why you can contrive better in time Martin and by
your thought and labour they will be doubly ours made by you for our
two selves and used by none but us

True says I greatly mollified but this pot now I can never make
you so brave a pot as this

Why very well Martin says she smiling at my earnestness bring it
and let us begone So I reached down the pot and espied therein a
longbarrelled pistol whipping it out I blew off the dust and saw
twas primed and loaded and with flint in place albeit very rusty I
was yet staring at this when my lady gives a little soft cry of
pleasure and comes to me with somewhat hidden behind her

Martin says she tis a good place after all for seesee what it
hath given you and she shewed me that which I had yawned for so
bitterly viz a good stout saw Tossing aside the pistol I took it
eagerly enough and though it was rusty a very serviceable tool I
found it to be

Ha comrade says I Now shall you have a chair with arms a
cupboard and a bed fit to lie on Here is all the furniture you may
want

And now says she let us begone if you would have your supper
Martin So I followed her through the little tunnel and having
lowered her on to the table gave her the pot and then albeit she was
mighty unwilling turned back minded to bring away the firelock and
pistol and any such odds and ends as might serve me

Reaching the cave I heard again the dismal groans and wailing but
much louder than before and coming to the door saw it opened on a
steep declivity of rock wherein were rough steps or rather notches that
yet gave good foothold so I began to descend this narrow way my
candle before me and taking vast heed to my feet but as I got lower
the rock grew moist and slimy so that I was halfminded to turn back
but having come this far determined to see where it might bring me
for now from the glooms below I could hear the soft lapping of water
Then all at once I stopped and stood shivering as well I might for
immediately beneath me I saw a narrow ledge of rock and beyond this a
pit black and noisome and full of sluggish water

For a long while as it seemed I stared down into this water scarce
daring to move lest I plunge into this dreadful abyss where the black
water lapping sluggishly made stealthy menacing noises very evil to
hear At last I turned about and mighty careful and so made my ways
up and out of this unhallowed place more painfully than I had come
Reaching the cave at last and very thankful I sought to close the
door but found it to resist my efforts This but made me the more
determined to shut out this evil place with its coldbreathing air and
I began to examine this door to discover the reason of its immobility
Now this as I have said was a narrow door and set betwixt jambs and
with lintel above very strong and excellent well contrived but as I
lifted my candle to view it better I stopped all at once to stare up at
a something fixed midway in this lintel a strange shrivelled black
thing very like to a great spider with writhen legs updrawn and now
peering closer I saw this was a human hand hacked off midway twixt
wrist and elbow and skewered to the lintel by a great nail And as I
stood staring up at this evil thing from somewhere in the black void
beyond the door rose a long agonised wailing that rose to a bubbling
shriek and though I knew this for no more than some trick of the wind
I felt my flesh tingle to sudden chill Howbeit I lifted my candle
higher yet and thus saw beneath this shrivelled clawlike hand a
parchment nailed very precisely at its four corners though black with
dust Wiping this dust away I read these words very fair writ in
bold clear characters

 ADAM PENFEATHER


In a while I turned from this hateful thing and coming to the bed
began to examine the huddle of goatskins and though full of dust and
something stiff found them little the worse for their long disuse the
same applied equally to the sailcloth the which though yellow was
still strong and serviceable Reaching the firelock from the corner I
found it to be furnished with a snaphaunce or flintlock and though
very rusty methought cleaned and oiled it might make me a very good
weapon had I but powder and shot for it But the bandoliers held in
all but two poor charges which powder I determined to keep for the
pistol Therefore I set the musket back in the corner and doing so
espied a book that lay open and face down beneath the bedstead Taking
it up I wiped off the dust and opening this book at the first page I
came on this

 ADAM PENFEATHER

 HYS JOURNAL

 1642

Hereupon perceiving in it many charts and maps together with a plan of
the island very well drawn I thrust it into my bosom and hearing my
lady calling me took pistol and bandolier and so to supper

Thus amidst howling storm and tempest we sat down side by side to sup
very silent for the most part by reason of this elemental strife that
raged about our habitation filling the world with awful stir and
clamour

But in a while seeing her so downcast and with head adroop I must
needs fall gloomy also and full of a growing bitterness

Art grieving for England says I at last Yearning for home and
friends and some man belike that loves and is beloved again

And why not Martin

Because tis vain

And yet twould be but natural

Aye indeed says I gloomily and forgetting my supper for
contrasting all you have lost home and friends and love with your
present evil plight here in this howling wilderness tis small wonder
you weep

But I am not weeping says she flushing

Yet you well may quoth I for here are you at the worlds end and
with none but myself for company

Why truly here is good cause for tears says she flashing her eyes
at me

Aye I nodded Tis a pity Fate hath chosen you so ill a companion

Indeed and so it is says she and turns her back on me And so we
sat awhile she with her back to me and I gloomy and despondent
hearkening to the howling of the wind

You eat no supper says I at last

Neither do you

I am not hungry

Nor I

Myself speaking after some while humbly Have I angered you

She Mightily

Myself Aye but how

She By your idle foolish talk for if I grow thoughtful sometimes
why must you ever dream me repining against my lot Tonight
hearkening to this dreadful tempest I was full of gratitude to God that
He had brought us to this safe harbourage and set me in your
companionship And if my heart cry out for England sometimes tis
because I do love England Yet my days here are too full of labour for
vain grieving and my labour like my sleep is joy to me And there is
no man I love in Englandor anywhere else

Myself and more humbly than ever Why then I pray you forgive me
comrade

At this she looks at me over her shoulder frowning and a little
askance

For indeed says I meeting this look I would have you know me ever
as your comrade to serve you faithfully seeking only your friendship
and nought beyond one you may trust unfearing despite my ungentle
ways

And now I saw her frown was vanished quite her eyes grown wondrous
gentle and her lips curving to a smile and so she reached out her hand
to me

And thus we two poor desolate souls found great solace and comfort in
each others companionship and hearkening to the roar of this mighty
tempest felt the bonds of our comradeship only strengthened thereby

When my lady was gone to bed I remembering Adams journal took it
out and drawing the candle nearer fell to examining the book more
closely It was a smallish volume but very thick and with very many
closewritten pages its stout leathern covers battered and stained
and an illlooking thing I thought it but opening it haphazard I
forgot all save the words I read these written in Adams small clerkly
hand for I came on this

May 10Glory be and thanks unto that Providence hath been my
salvation and poured upon unworthy me His blessing in that I this day
have fought and killed this murderous rogue and detestable pirate
Roger Tressady

Here followed divers accounts of his labours his discovery of these
caves and many cunning devices day by day until I came on this

May 28Today a stormbeat pinnace standing in for my island and in
it Abnegation Mings and divers others of Bartlemys rogues survivors
as I judge of that cursed ship Ladys Delight They landed being
fifteen in all and I in great fear and distress therefore They
leaving their boat unwatched I stole thither and to my great joy found
therein a watchcoat and bonnet 3 muskets 2 swords 5 pistols with
powder and shot all of which did hide among the rocks adjacent a
cunning hidingplace where I may fetch them at my leisure Providence
aiding

May 29This day 1 hour before dawn secured arms powder etc and
very grateful therefore

May 30Today set about strengthening and fortifying my door since
though Roger Tressady is dead there be other rogues yet to slay their
evil minds being full of lust for Black Bartlemys Treasure and my
blood And these their names

A true list of these rogues each and every known to me aforetime in
Tortuga viz

 My enemies My equipment against the same

 James Ballantyne
 Izaac Pym
 Robert Ball
 William Loveday
 Daniel Marston

 A boy and one woman


June 1This day waked by a shot and the sounds of lewd brawling I
to my lookout and mighty alarmed Upon the sands a fire and thereby a
woman and 6 or 7 of these rogues fighting for her She poor soul
running to escape falls shot and they to furious fight But my hopes
of their destroying each other and saving me this labour vain by reason
of Abnegation Mings bringing them to accord Thereafter they to
drinking and singing of this lewd piratical rant of theirs Whereupon
I tried a shot at them with my longbarrelled arquebus to no purpose
Have made me some ink and do answer very well

June 2Went ahunting three of my destroyers viz the rogues
Galbally Vokes and Bartalozzi But they wellarmed and keeping always
in company did no more than harm Vokes in the leg by a bullet and so
to my fort and mighty downcast Began to make myself a chair with
arms This day also wrote me out divers parchments thus

 JASPER VOKES

 SLAIN Of NECESSITY THIS  DAY
 LIKE ROGUES TAKE WARNING

 ADAM PENFEATHER

and of these parchments 13 the boy being already dead with every
rogue his name fair writ that they might know me for man of my word and
leave me and my treasure in peace

June 3The weather hot and I out after my bloodthirsty enemies Came
on the French rogue Durand and him sleeping Removed his firearms and
kicked him awake He to his sword and I to mine Took him in quarte at
the third passado through the right eyea shrewd thrust Tied a
parchment about his neck and so to my refuge very full of gratitude

June 4Today guided by Providence surprised Izaac Pym gorging
himself on wild grapes Spying me he whips out his pistol but I fired
first Tied a parchment about his neck and so left him

June 5Evil days for me since these murderous rogues keep ever
together now and on their watch against me day and night My great
chair finished and all I could wish it

June 9This night the moon full they assaulted my fort with huge
halloo and many shot battering my door with a great log for ram But
I shooting one and wounding others they left me in peace

June 10All this day ventured not abroad fearing an ambuscado And
lighting a fire within my inner cave the smoke showed me how I might
hide from my bloodthirsty foes an need be

June 11My wouldbe slayers camped all about my refuge and howling
for my blood though keeping well out of my line of fire So I to
making me a ladder of ropes whereby to come at my newfound sanctuary
Determine to make this my bedchamber

June 12My cruel enemies yet raging about me ravening for my blood
and I very fearful Have taken down my bed to set it within my secret
chamber

June 13This morning early the rogue Benjamin Denton venturing
within my firezone took a bullet in his midriff whereof he suddenly
perished

June 14This morning having gotten all my furniture into my secret
chamber do find myself very comfortable But my stores beginning to
run low do put myself on halfrations

June 15My murderers very silent with intent to lure me to my death

CHAPTER XXXIII

WE EXPLORE THE ISLAND

I opened my eyes to a great beam of sun pouring in at the open doorway
whereby I judged my companion already astir So I arose forthwith and
going out of the cave stood amazed to see the havoc wrought by last
nights storm For everywhere lay trees torn and uprooted and in
divers of the more exposed places the wind it seemed had swept them
utterly away so that the landscape here and there wore an air
unfamiliar and not to be recognised Though the wind was died away I
saw the sea yet rolling tempestuous to break in foam upon the reef and
with dreadful roar Looking down on Deliverance Beach I beheld its
white sands littered with piles of driftwood and over all a cloudless
blue with the sun newrisen and very hot

And now taking my hooks and line and a pliant bough for rod I went
forth to angle for breakfast Reaching the lagoon great wonder was it
to behold these waters so smooth and placid while the surf foamed and
thundered beyond the reef I now baited my hooks with fat of the goat
and betook me to my angling nor had I long to wait ere I felt a jerk
on my line and tingling with the joy of it I whipped my rod so
furiously that my fish whirled glittering through the air and flying
from my barbless hook lay floundering on the sands behind me and
though of no great size yet a very good fish I thought him And indeed
I found the fish to bite readily enough and mighty dexterous to filch
my bait and though I lost amany yet I becoming more expert
contrived to land five likely fish of different sizes and of marvellous
colouring

So there sat I in the shade of a rock mighty content and quite lost in
the joy of my sport until chancing to lift my gaze I beheld my
companion upon the rocks over against me gazing away across the
troubled ocean And beholding all the grace of her as she stood there
her shapely figure poised and outlined against the blue sky her long
hair rippling in the soft wind I clean forgot my fish for indeed it
seemed I had not noticed the vigorous beauty of her until now And in
this moment as I sat staring up at her she turned and spying me
waved her hand in cheery greeting and begins to descend these rocks
leaping surefooted from ledge to ledge lithe and graceful as any
fabled nymph or goddess of them all But I well knowing the danger of
these rocks watched her with breath in check and mighty anxious until
she sprang nimbly to the sands and so came running all joyous to meet
me Hereupon I caught up my forgotten angle and found my hook empty
whereat she must needs fall alaughing at my discomfiture

O Martin says she what a glory of sun and sea and sky and the wind
so sweet Indeed it seems as nature would make us amends for the cruel
storm for the poor trees have suffered greatly

Aye comrade quoth I so is there much fruit for us to gather ere
it rot and great store of palmnuts which are good food and useful in
a thousand ways

But nature is very cruel Martin for I have seen many birds lying
dead and over yonder a poor goat crushed by a tree

Why then says I these will we eat also at least such as we may

Nay Martin your mind runneth overmuch on food methinks

Mayhap says I Howbeit here are fish to our breakfast Hereupon
she falls on her knees to behold my catch and very full of wonder

Indeed says she meseemeth we have strayed into Paradise for even
the fish are beautiful Why stare you so Martin Is it so wonderful
I joy in life and find it sweet in so fair a world and on such a day
Moreover I have been swimming

How says I and the sea so rough

I have found me a little bay where the waters run smooth and deep
But come let us breakfast for today Martin today we will explore
our island

Why I had thought to try my saw today says I I had intended to
begin a chair for you

Nay let this rest awhile Martin today I yearn to adventure the
unknown who can say what marvels and wonders lie waiting us

As you will says I rising and so away to the plateau Now very
soon I had the fire agoing and while she bustled to and fro preparing
breakfast and singing very sweet and blithe to hear I took the pistol
and having cleaned and oiled it found it very well then I loaded it
with one of my six bullets using a strip from my ragged shirtsleeve
for wads This done I laid it by and going for Adams journal I cut
therefrom the map of the island and fell to studying it with a view to
our forthcoming journey The which map I give herewith

Map of the island

Hearing my companion call me I went out to find breakfast ready the
fish broiled and very appetising While we ate I showed her Adams map
and she greatly pleased therewith and anxious to know how I came by it
all of which I told her And she examining this plan grows but the
more eager to be gone on this expedition

But Martin says she all at once as she studied the map Master
Penfeather would seem to have been forced to slay a great number of
poor men here beonetwothreeO many men all dead by his
handand each marked with a little cross

Aye I nodded and each and every slain of necessity 

Which meanethwhat Martin

Murder like as not though tis all cunningly glozed in his journal

I would fain see this journal Martin

Why so you shall and judge thereby whether he be rogue or no for
tis beyond me

But now says she rising let us make ready for our journey though
twill be no great matter for according to this plan the island is no
more than seven miles long and some five miles wide

Even so quoth I twill be ill travelling by reason of woods and
tangled thickets swamps and the like so I judge twill take the whole
day

Why then says she leaping up the sooner we start the better
Martin

Hereupon finding her so set on it I proceeded to equip myself for the
journey in my belt I thrust my trusty knife and the hatchet these
balanced by the pistol and over my shoulder I slung my bow and quiver
of arrows and chose me a good stout sapling for staff Soon cometh my
companion her slender middle girt by a goatskin girdle whereto she had
hung our other sheathknife and my wallet so we set out together side
by side Reaching the little valley we turned off to the right or
westerly according to Adams map following the stream that rippled
amid great boulders or flowed twixt banks adorned with manyhued
flowers most rare to be seen And here were bushes of all kinds and
trees aplenty untouched by the gale for the little valley being well
secluded it fortuned the wind had passed over it Up rose the sun
waxing ever hotter so that reaching a grove of trees I would have my
companion rest awhile in this right pleasant shade the whiles I with
certain great leaves contrived a covering for her head and another for
my own which done we fared on again and she very merry by reason of
the strange figures we cut Thus we presently came out of the valley
into a pleasant champaina rolling grassy upland with dim woods
beyond even as Adam had set forth in his map Wherefore guided by
this map we struck off north and so in a while came again to the river
and heard the roar of the waterfall away to our left and turning
thither I being minded to show her this wonder we saw before us a
high land well girt by bush and fern and flowering shrubs up which we
scrambled forthwith the roar of the fall waxing louder as we climbed
Reaching the summit we saw it had once been covered by noble trees
some few of which the storm had left standing yet but for the most
part they lay windtossed in wild and tangled confusion

O Martin says my companion O Martin and so stood awed by the
destruction wrought by this mighty and pitiless tempest Here was
illgoing but by dint of labour with my hatchet I forced us a way
through the wreckage until we suddenly came where we might behold the
fall that leapt from the adjacent rocks all rainbowhued to plunge
into those deep and troubled waters below

And now instead of bursting forth into cries of delighted wonder as I
had expected my companion stood mute and still her hands
tightclasped viewing now the splendour of these falling waters now
the foamsprent deeps below like one quite dumbfounded At last

O Martin says she in my ear for the noise of the fall was very
loud here is wonder on wonder

As how comrade

This great body of water for all its weight yet disturbeth yonder
black depths very littleand how should this chance except this dark
lake be immeasurably deep

Aye true says I Here belike was a volcano once and this the
crater

Hard by a great rock jutted out above the lake that same barren rock
wherein I had sat the day I discovered this cataract now as I viewed
this rock I was struck by its grotesque shape and then all at once I
saw it was hatefully like to a shrivelled headthere were the
fleshless jaws the shrunken nose and great hollow eyesocket And
now even as I stared at the thing my companion spied it also for I
felt her hand on my arm and saw her stand to view it wideeyed So we
speaking no word stared upon this shape and ever as we stared the
nameless evil of it seemed to grow insomuch that we turned with one
accord and hasted away

Yonder was an ill sight Martin

Indeed says I Twas like the face of one long dead And yet tis
no more than a volcanic rock Nature playeth strange tricks sometimes
and here was one vastly strange and most unlovely After this we went
on side by side and never a word betwixt us until we had reached that
pleasant champain country where flowed the river shaded by goodly
trees in whose branches fluttered birds of a plumage marvellously
coloured and diverse and beneath which bloomed flowers as vivid
insomuch that my lady brake forth ever and anon into little soft cries
of delighted wonder And yet despite all these marvels it was long ere
we shook off the evil of that ghastly rock

Presently as we journeyed came a wind sweet and fresh from the sea
offsetting the suns immoderate heat to our great comfort so that
though ofttimes our way was toilsome our spirits rose notwithstanding
and we laughed and talked unfeignedly as only good comrades may

By noon we had reached a place of rocks where according to Adams map
should be a ford though hereabouts the stream swollen by the late
rains ran deep Howbeit we presently came upon the ford sure enough
and having crossed it my lady must needs fall to admiring at her new
shoes again finding them waterfast

And they so comfortable and easy to go in Martin

Why you have footed it bravely thus far says I But

But says she And what then You shall find me no laggard these
days Martin Indeed I could run fast as you for all your long legs
sir

So she challenges me to race her forthwith whereupon and despite the
sun we started off side by side and she so fleet that I might scarce
keep pace with her thus we ran until at last we stopped all flushed
and breathless and laughing for the pure joy of it

Presently in our going we came on a little dell very shady and
pleasantly secluded where flowers bloomed and great clusters of wild
grapes hung ripe for the plucking and mighty pleasant methought it to
behold my companions pleased wonderment Here we sat to rest and
found these grapes very sweet and refreshing

Much might I tell of the marvels of this island of fruit and bird and
beast of the great butterflies that wheeled and hovered resplendent
and of the many and divers wonders that beset us at every turn but
lest my narrative grow to immoderate length of the which I do already
begin to entertain some doubt I will pass these with this mere mention
and hurry on to say that we tramped blithely on until the sun
declining westwards warned us to be turning back but close before us
rose that high hill whose summit towered above the island and my
companion mighty determined that she must climb it

For Martin says she scornful of all weariness once up there we
may behold all our domain spread out before us

So having skirted the woods and avoided tangled thickets as well as we
might we began the ascent which we found to be no great matter after
all And now I bethought me how Adam had sped hotfoot up hereabouts on
a time and with Tressadys glittering hook ringing loud on the rocks
behind him More than once as we climbed we came on flocks of goats
that scampered off at sight of us here too I remarked divers great
birds and determined to try a shot at one if chance should offer As
to my companion I had all I could do to keep up with her until
flushed and breathless she turned to view me all radianteyed where we
stood panting upon the summit And now beholding the prospect below
she uttered a soft inarticulate cry and sinking down upon the sward
pushed the damp curls from her brow the better to survey the scene
outstretched before us

A rolling wooded country of broad savannahs of stately groves and
mazy boskages of dim woods and flashing streams a blended harmony of
greens besplashed here and there with blossoming thickets or
flowering trees the whole shut in by towering treegirt cliffs and
bounded by a limitless ocean blue as any sapphire

Viewing the island from this eminence I could see that Adams map was
true in all essentials as to shape and general trend of the country
and sitting beside my lady I fell to viewing the island more narrowly
especially this eminent place and looking about me I called to mind
how Adam according to his story had waged desperate fight with
Tressady hereaboutsindeed I thought to recognise the very spot
itself viz a narrow ledge of rock with far below a sea that ran
deeply blue to break in foam against the base of these precipitous
cliffs Away over hill and dale I saw that greeny cliff with its
silver thread of falling water that marked our refuge and beyond this
again on my right hand the white spume of the breakers on the reef
And beholding the beauties thus spread out before my eyes and knowing
myself undisputed lord of it all there grew within me a sense of joy
unknown hitherto

At last moved by a sudden thought I turned from the beauties of this
our island to study the beauty of her who sat beside me the proud
carriage of her shapely head neath its silky masses of hair the level
brows the calm deep serenity of her blue eyes the delicate nose
full red lips and dimpled chin the soft round column of her throat
deep bosom and slender waistthus sat I staring upon her loveliness
heedless of all else until she stirred uneasily as if conscious of my
regard and looked at me Then I saw that her eyes were serene no
longer whiles all at once throat and cheeks and brow were suffused
with slow and painful colour yet even as I gazed on her she met my
look unflinching

What is it Martin she questioned a little breathless still

Suppose says I slowly suppose we are never taken hencesuppose we
are destined to end our days here

Surely this isan ill thought Martin

Indeed and is it my lady Can the world offer a home more fair

Surely not Martin

Then wherein lieth the illDamaris Is it that you do yearn so
mightily for England

There lieth my home Martin

Is home then so dear to you Here finding no answer she grew
troubled Or is it says I bending my staff across my knee and
beginning to frown or is it that there waits some man yonder that you
love

No Martin have I not told you

Why then says I is it that you grow aweary of my unlovely ways
and would be quit of me

No Martinonlyonly Here she fell silent and I saw her flush
again

Or is it that you fear I might grow to love youin time

Tolove me says she very softly and now I saw her red lips dimple
to a smile as she stooped to cull a flower blooming hard by Nay
says she lightly Here were a wonder beyond thought Martin

And wherefore should this be so great wonder I demanded

Because I am Joan Brandon and you are a man vowed and sworn to
vengeance Martin

Vengeance says I and with the word the staff snapped in my hands

Is it not so Martin she questioned wistfully Given freedom from
this island would you not go seeking your enemys life Dream you not
of vengeance still

Aye true says I true How should it be otherwise Come let us
begone And casting away my broken staff I got to my feet But she
sitting there lifted her head to view me with look mighty strange

Poor Martin says she softly Poor Martin

Then she arose albeit slow and wearily and we went down the hill
together Now as we went thus I in black humour and never a word I
espied one of those great birds I have mentioned within easy range and
whipping off my bow I strung it and setting arrow on cord let fly and
brought down my quarry as luck would have it and running forward had
very soon despatched it

Why must you kill the poor thing Martin

For supper

Supper waiteth us at home

Home says I

The cave Martin

We shall not reach there this night Twill be dark in another hour
and there is no moon so needs must we bide here

As you will Martin

Hard beside the river that wound a devious course through the green was
a little grove and sitting here I fell to plucking the bird

Shall I not do that Martin

I can do it well enough

As you wish Martin

You are weary doubtless

Why tis no great labour to cook supper Martin

Howbeit Ill try my hand tonight

Very well says she and away she goes to collect sticks for the fire
whiles I sat feathering the bird and found the flesh of it very white
and delicate But all the while my anger swelled within me for the
folly I had uttered to her in a moment of impulse concerning love
Thus as she knelt to build the fire I spoke my thought

I said a vain and foolish thing to you a while since

Aye Martin you did says she bending over her pile of sticks But
which do you mean

I mean that folly regarding love

O was that folly Martin she questioned busy laying the sticks in
place

Arrant folly for I could never love youor any woman

O why not Martin

Because I have no gift fortno leaning that waynor ever shall

Why indeed you are no ordinary man Martin Shall I light the fire

No I will

Yes Martin And down she sits with folded hands watching me mighty
solemn and demure and I very conscious of her scrutiny Having plucked
and drawn my bird I fell to trimming it with my knife yet all the
time feeling her gaze upon me so that what with this and my anger I
pricked my thumb and cursed beneath my breath whereupon she arose and
left me

Having thus prepared my bird for cooking I set it upon two sticks and
lighting the fire sat down to watch it But scarce had I done so when
back comes my lady

Martin says she should you not truss your bird first Martin

Twill do as it is

Very well Martin But why are you so short with me

I am surly by nature quoth I

Aye true she nodded But why are you angry with me this time

I ha forgot

You were merry enough this noon and laughed gaily and once you fell
awhistling

The more fool I

Why then methinks I do like your follysometimes says she softly
But now see this river Martin tis called the Serpent Water in the
map and indeed it winds and twists like any snake But where should so
much water come from think you Let us go look

Nay not Iheres the bird to tend

Why then says she stamping her foot at me in sudden anger stay
where you are until you find your temper And may your bird burn to a
cinder And away she goes forthwith and I staring after her like any
fool until she was out of sight So there sat I beside the fire and
giving all due heed to my cooking but in a while I fell to deep
reflection and became so lost in my thoughts that roused by a smell of
burning I started up to find my bird woefully singed

This put me in fine rage so that I was minded to cast the carcass into
the fire and have done with it and my anger grew as the time passed
and my companion came not The sun sank rapidly and the bird I judged
wellnigh done wherefore I began to shout and halloo bidding her to
supper But the shadows deepening and getting no answer to my
outcries I started up clean forgetting my cookery and hasted off in
search of my companion calling her name now and then as I went
Following the stream I found it to narrow suddenly and it running very
furious and deep perceiving which I began to fear lest some mischance
had befallen my wilful lady Presently as I hurried on casting my
eyes here and there in search of her I heard above the rush of the
water a strange and intermittent roaring the which I could make
nothing of until at last forcing my way through the underbrush I saw
before me a column of water that spouted up into the air from a fissure
at the base of the hill and this waterspout was about the bigness of a
fairsized tree and gushed up some twenty feet or so now sinking to
half this height only to rise again Scarce pausing to behold this
wonder I would have hasted on and roaring louder than the water when
I beheld her seated close by upon a rock and watching me chin in hand

Why must you shout so loud says she reprovingly

I feared you lost says I like any fool

Would it matter so much And you so angry with me and no reason

Howbeit supper is ready

I am not hungry I thank you sir

But I am

Then go eat

Not alone says I and then very humbly Prithee comrade come to
supper indeed you should be hungry

And indeed Martin says she rising and giving me her hand I do
think I am vastly hungry after all So back we went together and
reaching the fire found the accursed bird burned black as any coal
whereupon I stood mighty downcast and abashed the while she laughed and
laughed until she needs must lean against a tree and I seeing her
thus merry at my expense presently laughed also Hereupon she falls
on her knees and taking the thing from the fire sets it upon a great
leaf for dish and turns it this way and that

Good lack Martin says she Tis burned as black een as I wished
This cometh of your usurpation of my duties sir And yet methinks
tis not utterly spoiled And drawing her knife she scrapes and trims
it cutting away the burned parts until there little enough remained
but that mighty delectable judging by the smell of it

So down we sat to supper forthwith and mighty amicable nay indeed
methought her kinder than ordinary and our friendship only the
stronger which did comfort me mightily

But our supper done we spake little for night was come upon us very
still and dark save for a glitter of stars by whose unearthly light
all things took on strange shapes and our solitude seemed but the more
profound and awesome

Above us a purple sky begemmed by a myriad stars a countless host
whose distant splendour throbbed upon the night round about us a gloom
of woods and thickets that hemmed us in like a dark and sombre tide
whence stole a sweet air fraught with spicy odours and over all a deep
and brooding quietude But little by little upon this silence crept
sounds near and far leafy rustlings a stirring in the undergrowth
the whimper of some animal the croak of a bird and the faint
neverceasing murmur of the surge

And I gazing thus upon this measureless immensity felt myself humbled
thereby and with this came a knowledge of the futility of my life
hitherto And now as often she had done ere this my companion
voiced the thought I had no words for

Martin says she softly what pitiful things are we lost thus in
Gods infinity

And doth it affright you Damaris

No Martin for God is allmerciful Yet I needs must think how vain
our little strivings our hopes and fears how small our joys and
sorrows

Aye truly truly quoth I

But says she leaning towards me in the firelight and with her gaze
uplifted to the starry heavens He who made the heavens is a merciful
God who hath made great lights  the moon and the stars to govern
the night So Martin let us give thanks unto the Lord for He is
good for His mercy endureth forever and in this knowledge methinks we
may surely rest secure

After this we fell silent again I for one being very full of
troublesome thought and perplexity and the sum of it this viz
whether a woman cast alone on a desolate island with a man such as I
had need to fear him To the which question answer found I none
Wherefore I got me another speculation to wit Whether a man and
woman thus solitary must needs go afalling in love with one another
Finding no answer to this either I turned halfminded to put the
question to my companion and found her fast asleep

She lay deepslumbering in the light of the fire her face halfhid
neath a tress of shining hair and I viewing her chin in fist saw in
her only the last of her hated race and knew in that moment that never
might there be aught of true love that pure passion high and
ennobling the which may lift man above his baser selfnever might
this be twixt her blood and mine And knowing this I knew also great
doubt and fear of myself And in my fear I lifted my gaze to the
stars those great lights set there by the hand of God and spake
thus within myself

Lord God quoth I Since love is not nor ever shall be twixt this
my companion and me do Thou protect her from the devil within me do
Thou aid me to keep the oath I sware in Thy name

But now and my prayer scarce uttered the Devil sprang and was upon
me and I forgetting all my oaths and resolutions yielded me joyously
to his will stirring in her slumbers my lady sighed turned and
throwing her arm out it chanced that her hand came upon my knee and
rested there and I shivering at her touch seized this hand and
caught it to my lips and began to kiss these helpless fingers and the
round soft arm above I felt her start heard her breath catch in a
sob but in my madness I swept her to my embrace Then as I stooped
she held me off striving fiercely against me all at once her struggles
ceased and I heard her breath come in a long tremulous sigh

Martin says she O thank God tis you I dreamed these Black
Bartlemys cruel arms about me and I was sick with fear and
horrorthank God tis you dear Martin and I safe from all harms
soever So hold me an you will Martin you that have saved me from so
much and will do till the end

Aye by God says I bending my head above her that she might not see
my face And so I will faithfully truly until the very end

Do I not know itO do I not know it says she in choking voice and
here lying beside me she must take my hand and hold it to her soft
cheek Indeed I do think there is no man like you in the whole world

At this knowing myself so unworthy I thought no man in the world so
miserable as I as I would have told her but dared not

God make me worthy of your trust says I at last

Tis a good prayer Martin Now hear mine tis one I have prayed
full oftGod make you strong enough to forgive past wrongs and
forgetting vengeance to love your enemy

Tis thing impossible says I

Yet the impossible shall come to pass soon or late Martin this am I
sure

And why so sure

My heart telleth me so says she drowsily and looking down I saw her
eyes were closed and she on the verge of slumber And beholding her
thus my selfhate grew insomuch that her fingers loosing their hold
I stole away my hand and seeing her asleep crept from the place
Being come to the stream I stood awhile staring down at the hurrying
waters minded to cast myself therein but presently I turned aside
and coming amid leafy gloom lay there outstretched my face hidden from
the stars and I very full of bitterness for it seemed that I was as
great a rogue and wellnigh as vile as ever Bartlemy had been And
thus merciful sleep found me at last



CHAPTER XXXIV

HOW I STOOD RESOLUTE IN MY FOLLY

The day was still young when we reached our habitation and both of us
glad to return especially my lady

For truly I do grow to love this home of ours says she and sets
herself to sweeping out her three caves As for me I was determined on
making her an arm chair forthright to the which end I took my saw and
set out for Deliverance Sands there to cut and select such timber as I
needed from my store But scarce was I come hither than I uttered a
shout of joy for there cast up high upon these white sands lay a
great mast in a tangle of ropes and cordage

Drawing near I saw this for the mainmast of some noble ship but lately
wrecked wherefore I hasted along the beach and out upon the reef to
see if haply any other wreckage had come ashore but found nothing to
reward my search Returning to the mast I saw to my joy that this
cordage was all new and sound though woefully tangled Howbeit I had
soon unravelled some fifty yards of good stout twine and abundance of
more yet to hand together with the heavier ropes such as shrouds and
backstays Taking this line I came to that rocky cleft where I had
killed the goat and clambering up the bushgrown cliff found it to be
honeycombed with caves large and small and with abundant evidences of
the animals I sought Wherefore choosing me a narrow wellworn track
I set there a trap formed of a running noose and this did I in divers
other places which done I returned to my labours on the mast At the
which occupation my lady finding me must needs fall to work beside
me aiding as well as she might like the true comrade she was

Thus by late afternoon I had coiled and stowed safely away more good
hempen rope and cordage than I could ever want This accomplished I
found time to praise my companions diligence but finding her all
wearied out with such rough and arduous labour grew mighty vexed with
my heedlessness reproaching myself therewith but she and all
toilworn as she was laughed her weariness to scorn as was ever her
way

Why Martin says she labour is a good thing and noble since it
giveth health and strength to both mind and body And tis my joy to
share in your labours when I may and a delight to see how cast here
destitute of all things you have contrived so much already The more
I work and the harder the more able am I for work so trouble not if I
do grow a little weary sometimes This comforted me somewhat until
chancing to see her hands I caught them in mine and turning them saw
these tender palms all red and blistered with the ropes and grieving
over them I would have kissed the poor little things had I dared and
indeed came mighty nigh doing it as she perceived I think for she
flushed and laughed and drew them from my hold

Nay Martin says she softly I would have you forget my
sexsometimes

Twere a thing impossible says I whereat she stealing a glance at
me flushed all the hotter

Why then says she You must not coddle and cosset me because I am a
woman

Never quoth I tis not my nature to do so

And yet you do Martin

As how

O in many waysthese blisters now why should your hands grow rough
and hard and not mine Nature hath formed me woman but Fate hath made
me your comrade Martin And how may I be truly your comrade except I
share your toil

Now when I would have answered I could not and turning from her to
stare away across the limitless ocean saw it agleam through a mist as
it were

Surely says I at last O surely never had man so sweet and true a
comrade And I so rude and unlovelyand in all ways so unworthy

But you are not Martin you are not

Aye but I ambeyond your guessing you that are so pure so
saintly

Saintly O Martin and here she laughs albeit a little tremulously
Surely I am a very human saint for I do grow mighty hungry and yearn
for my supper So prithee let us go and eat

But on our way we turned aside to see if we had any fortune with my
snares sure enough coming nigh the place we heard a shuffling and
snorting and presently discovered a goat fast by the neck and
halfchoked and beside her a little kid pitifully ableating

O Martin cries my lady and falling on her knees began caressing and
fondling the little creature whiles I secured the dam and mighty
joyful The goat for all its strangling strove mightily but lashing
its fore and hind legs I contrived to get it upon my shoulders and thus
burdened set off homewards my lady carrying the kid clasped to her
bosom and it very content there and small wonder

Tis sweet pretty thing says my lady stroking its silky hair and
shall soon grow tame

And here is the beginning of our flock our cheese and butter shall
not be long alacking now comrade

You must fashion me a press Martin

And a churn says I

Nay I can manage well enough with one of our pipkins

But a churn would be easier for you so a churn you shall have of
sorts

This evening after supper sitting by our fire my lady and despite
her weariness was merrier than her wont and very full of plans for the
future deciding for me what furniture I must construct next as chairs
two a cupboard with shelves and where these should stand when made

And Martin says she now that we own goats I must have a dairy for
my cheesemaking and my dairy shall be our larder aye and stillroom
too for I have been tending our garden lately and found growing many
good herbs and simples In time Martin these caves shall grow into a
home indeed and all wrought by our own hands and this is a sweet
thought

Why so it is says I in very truthbut

But what sir she questioned lifting admonishing finger

There may come a day when we may weary of it how then

Nay we are too busy

Can itcould it besays I beginning to stammerthat you might
live here thus content to the end of your days

The end of my days says she staring thoughtfully into the fire
Why Martin this is a long way in the future I do pray and our
future is in the hands of God so wherefore trouble

Because I who have been stranger to Happiness hitherto dread lest it
may desert me and leave me the more woeful

Are you then happy at lastand so suddenly Martin

Now this put me to no little heartsearching and perplexity for
casting back over the time since our landing on the island I knew that
despite my glooms and illhumours happiness had come to me in that
hour I had found her alive

Why I am no longer the miserable wretch I was quoth I at last

Because of late you have forgot to grieve for yourself and past wrong
and sorrows Martin Mayhap you shall one day forget them quite

Never quoth I

Yet so do I hope Martin with all my heart says she and with a
great sigh

Why then fain would I forget an I might but tis beyond me The
agony of the rowingbench the shame of stripesthe blood and
bestiality of it allthese I may never forget

Why then Martindear Martin says she all suddenly slipping from
her stool to kneel before me and reach out her two hands I do pray
our Heavenly Father here and now before you that you remembering all
this agony and shame may make of it a crown of glory ennobling your
manhoodthat you forgetting nothing may yet put vengeance from you
now and for ever and strive to forgetto forgive Martin and win
thereby your manhood and a happiness undreamed here she stopped her
bosom heaving her eyes all tender pleading and I O deaf and purblind
fool hearing heard not and seeing saw nought but the witching
beauty of her and now having her hands in mine beholding her so
near I loosed her hands and turned away lest I should crush her to me

Tis impossible I muttered I am a man and no angeltis
impossible Hereupon she rose and stood some while looking down into
the fire and never a word suddenly she turned as to leave me then
sitting on her stool drew out her hairpins and shook down her shining
hair that showed bronzered where the light caught it And beholding
her thus her lovely face offset by the curtain of her hair her deep
longlashed eyes the vivid scarlet of her mouth I knew the world
might nowhere show me a maid so perfect in beauty nor so vitally a
woman

Martin says she very softly as she began braiding a thick tress of
hair Have you ever truly loved any woman

No says I No

Could you so love I wonder

No says I again and clenching my hands Nonever

Why true says she more softly methinks in your heart is no room
for poor Love tis overfull of Hate and hate is a disease incurable
with you Ist not so Martin

Yesno Nay how should I know quoth I

Yet should love befall you upon a day twould be love unworthy any
good woman Martin

Why then says I God keep me from the folly of love

Pray rather that Love of its infinite wisdom teach you the folly of
hate Martin

Tis a truth says I bitterly a truth that hath become part of me
It hath been my companion in solitude my comfort in my shameful
misery my hope my very life or I had died else And nownow you bid
me forget itas twere some mere whimsy some idle fancythis thought
that hath made me strong to endure such shames and tribulations as few
have been forced to suffer

Aye I do I do she cried For your own sake Martin and for
mine

No quoth I A thousand times This thought hath been life to me
and only with life may I forego it

At this the busy fingers faltered in their pretty labour and bowing
her head upon her hand she sat her face hid from me until I not
doubting that she wept grew uneasy and questioned her at last

Nay my ladysince this must be sowherefore grieve

Grieve says she lifting her head and I saw her eyes all radiant and
her red lips upcurving in a smile Nay Martin I do marvel how
eloquent you grow upon your wrongs indeed tis as though you feared
you might forget them Thus do you spur up slothful memory which
giveth me sure hope that one day twill sleep to wake no more

And now or ever I might find answer she rose and giving me
Goodnight was gone singing to her bed and I full of bewilderment
But suddenly as I sat thus staring into the dying fire she was back
again

What now I questioned

Our goat Martin I may not sleep until I know her safecome let us
go look and speaking she reached me her hand So I arose and thus
with her soft warm fingers in mine we went amid the shadows where I
had tethered the goat to a tree hard beside the murmurous rill and
found the animal lying secure and placidly enough the kid beside her
The which sight seemed to please my lady mightily

But tis shame the poor mother should go tied always thus Could you
not make a picket fence Martin And she should have some refuge
against the storms to the which I agreed Thus as we went back we
fell to making plans one project begetting another and we very blithe
about it



CHAPTER XXXV

HOW MY DEAR LADY WAS LOST TO ME

And now followed a season of much hard work each day bringing its
varied tasks and we right joyous in our labour so that ofttimes I
would hear her singing away in her sweet voice merry as any grig or
find myself whistling lustily to the tap of my hammer And now indeed
my saw and all rusty though it was served me faithfully and well and
my carpentry went forward apace During this time also we added four
goats and six kids to our flock so that we had good store of milk and
having with my ladys help made our net with strands of cord knotted
crosswise we caught therewith great plenty of fish

Remembering my adventure with the Indian I furnished myself with a good
stout pike and a couple of javelins moreover I set up divers marks
like rovers and every day I would shoot at these with my bow so that
I soon became so dexterous I could bring down a bird on the wing six
times out of seven though in teaching myself this proficiency I lost
four of my Indian arrows beyond recovery

Thus sped the time all too quickly but with each day came a greater
understanding and a deeper amity betwixt my lady and me

Now much and very much might I set down here concerning this my sweet
comrade her many noble qualities and how as our fellowship
lengthened I that was a man selfish beyond thought finding her
unselfish always and uncomplaining seeing her so brave in the face of
adversity and indomitable to overcome all difficulty yet ever and
always a woman gracious and tender I by my very reverence for her
sweet womanhood became in some sense a better man

I might tell how when my black moods took me the mere sight of her
the sound of her voice the touch of her hand nay her very nearness
was enough to dispel them

I might paint to your imagination the way her hair curled at her
temples the trick she had of biting her nether lip when at all put
out of the jut of her pretty chin when angered Then the sweet
vibrant softness of her voice her laughter the wonder of her changing
moodsall these I would dilate upon if I might since tis joy to me
but lest I prove wearisome I will hasten on to the finding of Black
Bartlemys Treasure of all that led up to it and all those evils that
followed after it And this bringeth me to a time whenas we sat she
and I eating our breakfast and the world all radiant with a young sun

Tonight says she if my calculations be right should be a new
moon And I am glad for I do love the moon

Aye but how should you judge this says I wondering

Because I have kept a record Martin A stroke for each day and a
cross for every Sunday

Excellent quoth I Then you will know how long we have lived here

Two months and five days Martin

So long a time says I amazed

Hath it seemed so very long she questioned

No indeed says I No and theres the marvel

Tis no marvel Martin you have been too full of business to heed
time Let us reckon up what we have achieved thus far First of all a
threelegged stool for me

Hairpins says I

A spoon Martin and shoes for me

Lamps and candles quoth I

A table Martin

A fishing line and two hooks

Two armchairs Martin a cupboard and a press

A churn says I

You are forgetting our five pipkins Martin

True says I and clumsy things they are

But very useful sir Next a fishingnet and a bed for me Here is
fine achievement Martin Are you not proud to have wrought so much
and with so little

But there is much yet to do quoth I

So much the better says she Thus far I am well content

And happy I demanded

Aye Martinare you

Now at this I fell to profound reverie and she also and this the
subject of my musings viz

In every man and woman born into this world as it doth seem to me God
putteth some of His infinite self whereby all things are possible in
degree greater or smaller for to the God within us all things are
possible tis our very humanity that limits our potentialities
Confidence in this power within us is a mighty aid to all endeavour
whereby we our coward flesh notwithstanding may attempt great things
and though being human we ofttimes fail yet this very effort
strengthens and ennobles us

Who art thou cries Flesh to adventure thing so great and above thy
puny strength to perform Who art thou I am God answers
Mansoul Since finite man am I only by reason of thee base coward
Flesh Thus to my thinking in every man is angel and demon each
striving gainst each for the soul of him whereby he doeth evil or
good according to the which of these twain he aideth to victory
Howbeit thus it is with me I being despite my seeming slowness of
quick and passionate temper and of such desperate determination that
once set on a course needs would I pursue it though it led to my own
confounding and destruction For now indeed I wrought that the which
brought on my lady great sorrow and grievous peril and on myself
shame bloodshed and a black despair and this the manner of it

Are you not happy Martin says she Happy and proud to have
accomplished so much with so little

No says I and so bitterlyfierce that she blenched from me For
look now says I clenching my fist here have we wrought and slaved
together day in and day outand to what end

That we may liveto our comfort says she a little breathlessly

And to what end I demanded To what purpose have you cozened me to
labour thus

I I dont understand you Martin says she unsteadily

Heres you cast alone with me on this island He is a man says you
to yourself and I a lonely woman So must I keep him busy his mind
ever employed on some labour no matter what lest peradventure he make
love to me

Stop cries she angrily leaping up to her feet all in a moment
For shame Martin Conisby You wrong me and yourselfI am your
comrade

Nay you are a woman very subtle and quickwitted as you are
beautiful So have you kept me in ploy thus yearning meanwhile for
some shipanything to bear you safe away from me Often have I seen
you staring seaward and praying for a sail

O you lie Martin you lie Ah have I not trusted you

Aye as one might a tiger by humouring me and distracting my
attention All these weeks I have scarce touched you and kissed you
never nor had I thought tobut now by God

MartinO Martin what would you

Kiss you says I savagely and caught her wrists

Nay that you shall never dowith that look on your face cries she
and twisted so strongly as nigh broke my hold but despite all her
desperate striving struggle how she might I dragged her to me
pinning her arms in my cruel embrace but still she withstood me and
with such fury of strength that twice we staggered and came near
falling until all at once she yielded and lay all soft her breath
coming in little pitiful panting groans So I kissed her as I would
her hair her eyes her parted lips her cool soft throat until sun
and trees and green grass seemed to spin and whirl dizzily about me
until my lips were wet with her salt tears

O GodO God she whispered O Martin that I trusted so will you
kill my faith and trust Will you shame your comrade You that I
loved

Loved says I catching my breath and staring down at her tearwet
lashes Loved meO Damaris

Aye loved and honoured you above all men until the beast broke loose

And now cried I hoarsely And nowwhat Speak

Gods pityloose me Martin

And now whattell me Ist hate now scorn and contemptas twas
aboard ship

O Martinlet me go she sobbed

Answer me is it hate henceforth

Yes she panted Yes and tore herself from my hold But as she
turned to fly me I caught her back to me and madman that I was bent
her backward across my knee that I might look down into her eyes and
meeting my look she folded her hands upon her bosom and closing her
eyes spoke broken and humbled

Taketake your will of meBlack BartlemyI am notbrave enough to
stab you asshe did

Now at this I shivered and must needs cast my gaze towards that great
pimento tree that towered afar off So then my hateful dream had
come true and now I knew myself for black a rogue as ever Bartlemy had
been So I loosed her and starting up stood staring across the
desolation of ocean

O Damaris says I at last Here in my belt was my knife to your
hand twere better you had stabbed me indeed and I dying would have
kissed your feet after the manner of yon dead rogue As it is I must
live hating myself for having destroyed the best the sweetest thing
life could offer me and that your trust But O my lady says I
looking down where she knelt her face bowed upon her hands I do love
you reverently and beyond my life

Even greatly enough to forego your vengeance she questioned softly
and without glancing up

God help me cried I How may I forget the oath I swore on my
fathers grave

You broke your oath to me says she never stirring So do I know
that true love hath not touched you

Think of me as you will quoth I but

I know says she raising her head at last and looking up at me I
am sure Martin Where hate is true love can never be and love
howsoever vehement is gentle and reverent and being of God a very
holy thing But you have made of it a thing of passion merciless and
crueltis love debased

So will I get hence says I for since I have destroyed your faith
how shall you ever sleep again and know yourself secure and such rogue
as I near you Ill go Damaris Ill away and take your fears along
with me

Then the while she watched me dumbly I slung my bow and quiver of
arrows about me set the hatchet in my girdle and taking my pike
turned to go but checking my haste went into the cave she following
me silent always and taking the pistol from where it hung examined
flint and priming and charge and laid it on the table

Should you need me at any time shoot off this pistol and I will come
says I so goodbye my lady But scarce was I without the cave than
she comes to me with my chainshirt in her hands and when I would have
none of it grew the more insistent

Put it on says she gently who can tell what may befall you so put
it on I pray Thus in the end I donned it though with ill grace
which done I took my pike across my shoulder and strode away And
when I had gone some distance I glanced back and saw her standing where
I had left her watching me and with her hands clasped tight together

Goodbye Martin says she O goodbye and vanished into the
gloom of the cave

As for me I strode on at speed and careless of direction for my mind
was a whirl of conflicting thoughts and a bitter rage against myself
Thus went I a goodish while and allunheeding and so at last found
myself lost amidst mazy thickets and my eightfoot pike very
troublesome Howbeit I presently gained more open ways and went at
speed though whither I cared not The sun was westering when coming
out from the denser woods I saw before me that high hill whose rocky
summit dominated the island and bent my steps thitherward and then
all in a moment my heart gave a great leap and I stood still for borne
to me on the soft air came a sudden sharp sound and though faint with
distance I knew it for the report of a firearm At this thriceblessed
sound an overwhelming great joy and gratitude surged within me since
thus of her infinite mercy my lady had summoned me back and now as I
retraced my steps full of thankfulness I marvelled to find my eyes
awatering and myself all trembling eagerness to behold her loveliness
again to hear her voice mayhap to touch her hand indeed I felt as we
had been parted a year rather than a brief hour And now I got me to
dreaming how I should meet her and how she would greet me She should
find a new Martin I told myself Suddenly these deluding dreams were
shivered to horrible fear and myself brought sweating to a standstill
by another sound that smote me like a blow for I knew this for the
deeptoned report of a musket For a moment I stood leaning on my pike
as one dazed then the hateful truth of it seized me and I began to run
like any madman Headlong I went bursting my way through tangled
vines and undergrowth heedless of the thorns that gashed me cursing
such obstacles as stayed me now oerleaping thorny tangles now
pausing to beat me a way with my pikestaff running at breathless speed
whenever I might until having taken a wrong direction in my frenzy I
came out amid those vines and bushes that bordered the lake of the
waterfall and right over against the great rock I have mentioned But
from where I was the place being high I could see over and beyond
this rock and as I stood panting and wellnigh spent mighty
distraught and my gaze bent thitherward I shivered despite the sweat
that streamed from me with sudden awful chill for from those greeny
depths I heard a scream wild and heartrending and knowing this voice
grew sick and faint and sank weakly to my knees and now I heard vile
laughter then hoarse shouts and forth of the underbrush opposite
broke a wild piteous figure all rent and torn yet running very
fleetly as I watched cursing my helplessness she tripped and fell
but was up again all in a moment yet too late for then I saw her
struggling in the clasp of a ragged blackbearded fellow and with
divers other men running towards them

And now madness seized me indeed for between us was the lake and
though my bow was strung and ready I dared not shoot lest I harm her
Thus as I watched in an agony at my impotence my lady broke her
captors hold and came running and he and his fellows hard after her
Straight for the rock she came and being there stood a moment to stare
about her like the piteous hunted creature she was

Martin she cried O Martin and uttering this dolorous cry and or
ever I might answer she tossed wild arms to heaven and plunged over
and down I saw her body strike the water in a clean dive and vanish
into those dark and troubled deeps and with breath in check and
glaring eyes waited for her to reappear I heard vague shouts and
cries where her pursuers watched for her likewise but I heeded them
nothing staring ever and waitingwaiting But these gloomy waters
gave no sign and so at last my breath burst from me in a bitter
sobbing groan One by one the minutes dragged by until I thought my
brain must crack for nowhere was sign of that beloved shape And
thenall at once I knew she must be dead this sweet innocent slain
thus before my eyes snatched out of life and lost forever to me for
all time lost to me beyond recovery

At last I turned my haggard burning eyes upon her murderersfour of
them there were and all staring into those cruel black waters below
and not a word betwixt them Suddenly the blackbearded man snapped
his fingers and laughed even as my bowstring twanged then I saw him
leap backwards screaming with pain his shoulder transfixed by my
arrow Immediately and ere I might shoot again his fellows dragged
him down and lying prone on their bellies let fly wildly in my
direction with petronel and musquetoon And now had I been near
enough I would have leaped upon them to slay and be slain since life
was become a hateful thing As it was crouched there mid the leaves
I watched them crawl from the rock dragging their hurt comrade with
them Then seeing them stealing off thus a mighty rage filled me
ousting all other emotion and my bow in one hand and pike in the
other I started running in pursuit But my great pike proving
overcumbersome I cast it away that I might go the faster trusting
rather to my five arrows and the longbladed knife in my girdle and
the thought of this knife and its deadly work at close quarters
heartened me mightily as I ran yet in a while the passion of my anger
subsiding grief took its place again and a hopeless desolation beyond
words So ran I blinded by scalding tears and my heart breaking
within me and thus came I to a place of rocks and looking not to my
feet it chanced that I fell and striking my head against a rock knew
no more and lost in a blessed unconsciousness forgot awhile the
anguish of my breaking heart



CHAPTER XXXVI

TELLETH SOME PART OF A NIGHT OF AGONY

When at last I opened my eyes I found myself in a place of gloom and
very stiff and sore therefore I lay where I was nor sought to move
Little by little as I lay thus twixt sleep and wake I was aware of a
pallid glow all about me and lifting heavy head saw the moon low down
in the sky like a great golden sickle And staring up at this of a
sudden back rushed memory and with it my hopeless misery for now I
remembered how but a few short hours since my dear lady had
prophesied this new moon Hereupon crouching there my aching head
bowed upon my hands I gave myself up to my despair and a corroding
grief beyond all comforting

From where I crouched I might look down upon this accursed lake a
misty horror of gloomy waters and beholding this I knew that my
gentle patient comrade was gone from me that somewhere within those
black and awful depths her tender body was lying She was dead her
sweet voice for ever hushed she that had been so vitally alive And
remembering all her pretty ways I grew suddenly all blind with tears
and casting myself down lay a great while sobbing and groaning until
I could weep no more

At last sitting up I wondered to find my head so painful and putting
up my hand found my face all wet and sticky with blood that flowed from
a gash in my hair And remembering how I had fallen and the reason of
my haste I started up and forthwith began seeking my knife and hatchet
and presently found them hard by where I had tripped Now standing
thus knife in one hand and hatchet in the other I turned to look down
upon these dark and evil waters

Goodbye my lady says I Fare thee well sweet comrade Before
tomorrow dawn we will meet again I pray and shalt know me for truer
man and better than I seemed So turning my back on the lake I went
to seek my vengeance on her destroyers and death at their hands an it
might be so

In a while I came to that torrent where the water flowed out from the
lake its bed strewn with tumbled rocks and easy enough to cross the
water being less in volume by reason of the dry weather All at once I
stopped for amid these rocks and boulders I saw caught all manner of
drift as sticks and bushes branches and the like washed down by the
current and which all tangled and twisted together choked this narrow
defile forming a kind of barrier against the current Now as I gazed
at this my eyes as if directed by the finger of God beheld something
caught in this barrier something small and piteous to see but which
set me all atrembling and sent me clambering down these rocks and
reaching out shaking hand I took up that same threepronged pin I had
carved and wrought for her hair Thus stood I to view this through my
blinding tears and to kiss and kiss it many times over because it had
known her better than I But all at once I thrust this precious relic
into my bosom and stared about me with new and awful expectation for
the current which had brought this thing would bring more So I began
to seek among these rocks where the stream ran fast and in each pool
and shallow and once sweating and shivering stooped to peer at
something that gleamed white from a watery hollow and gasped my relief
to find it was no more than a stone None the less sought I with a
prayer on my lips dreading to find that white and tender body mangled
by the cruel rocks yet searching feverishly none the less Long I
stayed there until the moon highrisen sent down her tender beam as
though to aid me But of this time I will write no more since even
now it is a misery to recall

At last I that knew myself a man about to die turned me towards our
habitation those rocks she had called home and reaching the plateau
I stood still swept alternately by grief and passion to see this our
refuge all desecrated by vile hands our poor furniture scattered
without the cave And presently I espied her threelegged stool
standing where she had been wont to sit to watch and cheer me at my
labour coming thither I fell on my knees and laying my head thereon
wetted this unlovely thing with my tears and kissed it many times As
I lay thus much that she had done and said little things forgot till
now rushed upon my memory her sweet calm presence seemed all about
me soothing away the passion of my grief And in this hour that was to
end my miserable life I knew at last that I had loved her purely and
truly from the first and with such love as might have lifted me to
heaven And kneeling thus I spake aloud to this her sweet presence
that seemed to hover about me

O Damaris belovedas thou to scape shame hast chosen deathin
death Ill follow theetrusting to a merciful God that I may find thee
again Then uprising from my knees I came out from the shadows and
standing in the moons radiance looked heedfully to the edge of my
axe and with it gripped in my hand went out to find death



CHAPTER XXXVII

HOW I SOUGHT DEATH BUT FOUND IT NOT

Beyond Deliverance Sands I saw the glow of their fire and drawing
thither knew them camped in the shadow of that great pimento tree and
within that rocky gorge the which had afforded my dear lady and me our
first nights shelter Being come thither I sat me down and took
counsel how best to attack them that I might slay as many as possible
ere they gave me the death I hungered for and the end of it was I
began to scale the cliff my goatskin buskins soundless and very sure
amid the rocks

As I mounted I heard the hoarse murmur of their voices and knew by
their very intonation since I could hear no words as yet that they
were speaking English Reaching the summit and mighty cautious I
came where I might look down into the cleft

They lay sprawled about their fire four grimlooking fellows ragged
and unkempt three of them talking together and one who lay groaning
ever and anon

Be damned tye Joel for a lilylivered dog growled a great bony
fellow Heres good an island as man can want

And full of bloody Indianseh Humphrey says a blackjowled fellow
turning on the wounded man Us do know the Indians dont us
Humphrey Inca Aztec Mosquito and Cimaroon we know em and their
devils ways dont us Humphrey

Ayeaye groaned the wounded man They tortured me once and
theyve done for me at last by God My shoulders afire

And the shaft as took ye Humphrey were a Indian shafta Indian
shaft werent it lad And all trimmed wi gold arent it Here ye
may see for yourselves Sequently I do know it for the shaft of a
chief or cacique and where a cacique is theres Indians wi himO
thick as thievesI know and Humphrey knows I say this curst island
be full of Indians thick as fleas curse em And theyll have us
soon or late and torment us So what I says is lets away at the
flood and stand away for the Mainthe sea may be bad now and then but
Indians be worsealways and ever

Why as to that Ned the Indians ha left us alone

Aye cried the bony man And what o the wenchher was no Indian I
lay A fine dainty piece she was by hooky And handsome
ahhandsome But for Humphreys bungling

Here the man Humphrey groaned and cursed the speaker bitterly

Howbeittwas an Indian arrer says Ned And that means Indians
and Indians means death to all on usask Humphrey Deatheh
Humphrey

Ayedeath groaned Humphrey Deaths got his grapples aboard me
now Im adying matesdying Get me aboard death will come easier
in open water

Why if ye must die Humphrey growled the bony man die lad die
and get done wi it the sooner the better As to Indians I wait till
I see em and as for Death

Death gasped Humphrey Heres for you first and whipping out a
knife he made a fierce thrust at the speaker but the others closed
with him Then as they strove together panting and cursing I rose to
come at them but the wounded man chancing to lift his head saw me
where I stood the moonlight on my bloody face and uttered a hoarse
scream

Death cries he Tis on us mateslook look yonder Death and
woundsyonder he comes for all of usO mates look Yons deathfor
all on us

But in this moment I leaped down upon them from above sending one man
sprawling and scattering their fire and mid whirling sparks and
smoke within this dim rockcleft we fought with a merciless fury and
desperation beyond words A pistol flashed and roared and then another
as I leapt with whirling axe and darting knife I remember a wild
hurlyburly of random blows voices that shouted hoarse blasphemies
screams and groans a whirl of vicious arms of hands that clutched
once I reeled to harddriven swordthrust a knife flashed and stabbed
beneath my arm but twice I got home with my knife and once a man
sobbed and went down beneath my hatchetand then they were running and
I after them But I had taken a scathe in my leg and twice I fell
thus they reached their boat with some hundred yards to spare and I
saw their frantic struggles to launch it as I staggered after them but
ere I could reach them they had it afloat and tumbled aboard pellmell
Then came I panting curses and plunged into the sea wading after
them up to my middle and so near that aiming a blow at one of them I
cut a great chip from the gunwale but reeling from the blow of an
oar sank to my knees and a wave breaking over me bore me backward
choking Thus when I found my feet again they were well away and plying
their oars lustily whiles I roaring and shouting stood to watch them
until the boat was lost in the distance Now as I stood thus raging
bitterly at my impotence I bethought me that I had seen but three men
run and turning about hasted back to deal with the fourth Reaching
the scene of the struggle I came on the man Humphrey outstretched upon
his back in the moonlight and his face wellnigh shorn asunder Seeing
him thus so horribly dead I went aside and fell to scrubbing my
hatchet blade and haft with the cleanly sand

Then came I and grasping this thing had been named Humphrey I dragged
it adown the sands and hove it forthwith into the sea standing
thereafter to watch it borne out on the receding tide Now as I watched
thus came a wave that lifted the thing so that this dead man seemed to
rise up and wave an arm to me ere he vanished

This done and I yet alive I took to wandering aimlessly hither and
thither and chancing into the rocky cleft found lying three muskets
and four pistols with bandoliers fullcharged together with a knife
and a couple of swords these I set orderly together and so wandered
away again

All this night I rambled about thus and dawn found me seated neath
Bartlemys tree staring at the ocean yet seeing it not

So God had refused my appeal It seemed I could not die And
presently chancing to look down at myself in the growing light I
understood the reason for here was I armed in my shirt of mail
forgotten till now and scowling down at this I saw its fine steel
links scratched and scored by many blows and bedaubed here and there
with blood So then thinks I twas she had saved me alive and in
this thought found me some small solace Hereupon I arose and went
down to the sea limping by reason of my hurt an ugly gash above my
knee being minded to wash from me the grime and smears that fouled me
But or ever I reached the water I stopped for there more hateful in
sun than moonlight lay that ghastly thing that had been Humphrey
There he lay cast up by the tide and now with every wave that broke
he stirred gently and moved arms and legs in wanton silly fashion and
nodding with his shattered head as in mockery of me So I went and
seizing hold upon the thing swung it upon my back and thus burdened
climbed out upon the reef and with mighty trouble for my strength
seemed oozing out of me Reaching a place at last where the water ran
deep I paused and with sudden painful effort whirled the thing above
my head and hove it far out where splashing it fell with sullen
plunge and vanished from my sight But even so I was possessed of
sudden uneasy feeling that the thing had turned on me and was swimming
back to shore so that drawing my knife I must needs sit there awhile
to watch if this were so indeed At last I arose but being come to
Deliverance Sands whirled suddenly about expectant to behold that
dead thing uprising from the surge to flap derisive arms at me And
this did I many times being haunted thus all that day and for many
weary hours thereafter by this dead man Humphrey Presently as I went
heedless of all direction and the sun very hot I began to stagger in
my gait and to mutter her name to myself and presently to shouting it
until the cliffs gave back my cries and the hollow caves murmured
Damaris O Damaris

And now was a mist all about me wherein dim forms moved mocking me and
ever and anon methought to behold my lady but dim and very far removed
from me so that sometimes I ran and ofttimes I fell to moaning and
shedding weak and impotent tears Truly a black and evil day for me
this whereof I have but a vague memory save only of pain a hopeless
weariness and intolerable thirst Thus it was sunset when I found
myself once more upon that grassy plateau creeping on hands and knees
though how I came thither I knew not I remember drinking from the
little rill and staggering within the cave there to fall and lie
filling the place with my lamentations and oftrepeated cry of
Damaris O Damaris I remember a patch of silver light a radiance
that crept across the gloom and of dreaming my lady beside me as of
old and of babbling of love and forgiveness of pain and heartbreak
whiles I watched the beam of light creeping nigh me upon the floor
until sobbing and moaning yet gazing ever upon this light I saw grow
upon it a sudden dark shape that moved heard a rustle behind me a
footstepa cry And knowing this for the man Humphrey come upon me at
last in my weakness I strove to rise to turn and face him but
finding this vain cried out upon him for murderer Twas you killed
hermy lovethe very soul of metwas you Humphrey that are
deadcome that I may slay you again Then feeling his hands upon me
I strove to draw my knife but could not and groaned and so knowledge
passed from me



CHAPTER XXXVIII

CONCERNING THE DEAD MAN HUMPHREY AND HOW I SAW A VISION IN THE MOONLIGHT

My next memory was of sun and a dance of leafy shadows on the wall of
the cave the which shadows held my attention so that I had no will to
look otherwhere for these were merry shadows that leapt in sportive
gambols that danced and swayed pleasing me mightily And as I
watched these antic shadows I could hear the pleasant murmur of the
little rill without the cave that bubbled with sweet soft noises like
small babbling voices and brake ever and anon into elfin laughter
And presently mingled with this pretty babblement I seemed to hear a
whisper

Martin Dear Martin

And now I saw my lady plunge to death from the rock and started up
filling the place with my lamentations until for very weakness I lay
hushed and heard again the soft rippling of the brook and therewith her
voice very sweet and faint and far away

Martin Dear Martin

I remember a season of blackness in which dimseen evil things menaced
me and a horror of dreams wherein I fettered and fast bound must
watch my sweet lady struggle weeping in the arms of vile rogues
whiles I strove desperately to break my bonds and finding this vain
fell to raging madness and dashed myself hither and thither to slay
myself and end my torment Or axe in hand amid smoke and flame I
fell upon her murderers then would I smite down the man Humphrey only
for him to rise to be smitten again and yet again nodding shattered
head and flapping nerveless arms in derision of me until knowing I
might never slay himhe being already deadI turned to flee but with
him ever behind me and in my ears his sobbing cry of Death for all of
usdeath And feeling his hands on me I would fall to desperate
struggle until the blackness closed over me again thick and stifling
like a sea

And behind all these horrors was a haunting knowledge that I was going
mad that this man Humphrey was waiting for me out beyond the surf
beckoning to me with flapping arms and had cast on me a spell whereby
as my brain shrivelled to madness my body was shrivelling and changing
into that of Black Bartlemy Always I knew that Humphrey waited me
beyond the reef watchful for my coming and growing ever more querulous
and eager as the spell wrought on me so that he began to call to me in
strange sobbing voice hailing me by my new name

Bartlemy ahoy Black BartlemyBartlemy ho Come your ways to
Humphrey that being dead can die no more and knowing all doth know
you for Bartlemy crept back from hell So come Bartlemy come and be
as I am And theres others here proper lads as wants ye too dead
men allby the rope by the knife by the bulletoho

 There be two at the fore
 At the main be three more
 Dead men that swing all of a row
 Heres fine dainty meat
 For the fishes to eat
 Black BartlemyBartlemy ho

 Theres a fine Spanish dame
 Joannas her name
 Must follow wherever ye go
 Till your black heart shall feel
 Your own cursed steel
 Black BartlemyBartlemy ho

And I hearkening to this awful sobbing voice sweating and shivering
in the dark knew that since I was indeed Black Bartlemy sooner or
later I must go

Thus it befell that of a sudden I found myself dazzled by a fierce
sun supporting me against a rock and my breath coming in great gasps
And in a while my eyes growing stronger I stared away to the reef
where this man Humphrey waited me with his dead men all and since I
must needs go there I wept because it was so far off

Now as I stood grieving thus I saw one stand below me on Deliverance
looking also towards the reef a woman tall and very stately and
habited in gown of rich satin and embroidery caught in at slender waist
with golden girdle and about her head a scarf of lace And this woman
stood with bowed head and hands tightclasped as one that grieved also
suddenly she raised her head and lifted folded hands to the cloudless
heaven in passionate supplication And beholding her face I knew her
for the poor Spanish lady imploring just heaven for vengeance on me
that had been her undoing and uttering a great cry I sank on my knees

Mercy O Godmercy Let me not be mad

Yet even as I prayed I knew that madness was upon me ere I plunged
again into the dreadful dark

But God whose mercy is infinite hearkened to my distressful cry for
in a while He brought me up from that black abyss and showed me two
marvels the which filled me with wonder and a sudden passionate hope
And the first was the bandage that swathed my thigh and this of itself
enough to set my poor wits in a maze of speculation For this bandage
was of linen very fine and delicate such as I knew was not to be
found upon the whole island yet here was it bound about my hurt
plain and manifest and set there by hands wellskilled in such kindly
work

And my second wonder was a silver beaker or ewer very artfully wrought
and all chased and embossed with designs of fruit and flower and of a
rare craftsmanship and this jug set within my reach and halffull of
milk The better to behold this I raised myself and with infinite
labour But now and suddenly she was before me again this poor
Spanish lady I had slain upon a time wherefore I blenched and shrank
from her coming But she falling upon her knees sought to clasp me
in her arms crying words I heeded not as maugre my weakness I strove
wildly to hold her off

I am Bartlemy that killed you says I I am Black Bartlemy They
know out yonder beyond the reef hark and you shall hear how they hail
me

O kind God teach me how I may win him back to knowledge So crying
this Spanish lady of a sudden unpinned her hair and shook its glossy
ripples all about her

Look Martin cries she Dont you know meO dont you know me now
I am Joancome back to you

No says I NoDamaris is dead and lostI saw her die

Then who am I Martin

The Spanish lady orone of the ghosts do haunt me

But now her hands were clasping mine her soft hair all about me as she
stooped And feeling these hands so warm and vital so quick and
strong with life I began to tremble and strove against her no longer
and so she stooped above me that I might feel her sweet breath on
fevered cheek and brow

Tis your Damaris Martin says she her tears falling fast tis
your comrade hath come back to comfort you

Now seeing how I stared all trembling and amazed she set her arms
about me and drawing me to her bosom clasped me there And my head
pillowed thus I fell aweeping but these tears were tears of joy and
thankfulness beyond all words

O Damaris quoth I at last if this be death I care not since I have
seen thee again

Why Martin says she weeping with me art indeed so gladso glad
to find again thy poor comrade

And thus knowing myself forgiven a great joy sang within me



CHAPTER XXXIX

HOW MY DEAR LADY CAME BACK TO ME

I was sitting in one of our armchairs amid the leafy shade watching her
knead dough with her two pretty fists To this end she had rolled up
the sleeves of her splendid gown and thus I hearkening to her story
must needs stare at her soft round arms and yearn mightily to kiss
their velvety smoothness and instantly berating myself therefor
shifted my gaze from these temptations to my own unlovely figure
contrasting myself and my worn garments with her rich attire and proud
and radiant beauty she was again the great lady and far removed above
such poor wretch as I for all her pitiful tenderness

 and so when I plunged from the rock she was saying I never
thought to see this dear place again or the blessed sun And I sank 
O deepdeep Then Martin I seemed to be caught in some current far
down there in the darkness that whirled and tossed me and swept me up
behind the torrent And in the rock was a great cavern sloping to the
water and there this current threw me all breathless and nigh dead
Martin

God be thanked says I fervently

And there I lay all night Martin very sick and fearful When day
came I saw this great cave opened into a smaller and this into yet
another So I came to a passage in the rock and because there was
none other way for me I followed thisand thenO Martin

What quoth I leaning forward

Have you ever been to the palace at Versailles Martin

Once as a boy with my father

Well Martin the cavethe hall I came to at last was more splendid
than any Versailles can show And then I knew that I had foundBlack
Bartlemys Treasure

Ha quoth I And is it indeed so great

Beyond description says she clasping her floury hands and turning
on me with shining eyes I have held in my hands jewelsO by the
handful Great pearls and diamonds rubies emeralds
sapphiresbeyond price

Aye I nodded But was this all

All Martin says she staring

Why according to Adam there should be all manner of stores says I
powder and shot toolsa carpenters chest

They are all there with provisions of every kind as witness this
flour Martin but I heeded only these wondrous jewels Hereupon she
turns to her work again describing to me the splendour of these
precious stones and the wonder of Bartlemys treasure whiles I
viewing her loveliness would have given such foolish treasure a
thousand times for but her little finger as watching the play of her
round arms again I fell asighing whereupon she turns all anxious
questioning

Doth your wound trouble you Martin

Nay indeed says I shaking my head I am very well I thank you

Then wherefore sigh so deep and oft

I am a vasty fool

Are you Martinwhy But in place of answer I rose and coming
beside her scowled to see the tender flesh of her arms all black and
bruised

What is this I demanded

Nought to matter

Who did it

You Martin In your raving you were very strong mistaking me for
the poor Spanish lady

O forgive me I cried and stooping to this pretty arm would have
touched my lips thereto for mere pity but checked myself fearing to
grieve her perceiving this she comes a little nearer

You mayan you so desire Martin says she though tis all
floury So I kissed her arm tenderly and very reverently as it had
been some holy thing as indeed so I thought it

Im glad twas I did this comrade

Glad Martin

Aye I had rather twas myself than yon evil roguesnay forget
them says I seeing her shiver plague on me for reminding you

Hush Martin

Why then forget themand I have their weapons to cope with em
should they return

Now thank God cries she clasping my hand in both of hers Thank
God Martin I feared you had killed them all

Why I did my best I sighed shaking my head but they were too
strong for me Would to God I had indeed slain

Hush Martin O hush And here she claps her pretty hand to my lips
where I straightway prisoned it to my kisses Though truly says
she the whiles this was adoing from your raving I feared them all
slain at your hand so do I rejoice to know you innocent of their
deaths Here her hand released she fell alaughing albeit a little
tremulously to see my face all patched with flour and so back to her
labour

But Martin says she turning to glance at me in a while You must
be very terrible to drive away these four great men and very brave

Here was no bravery quoth I Methought you surely dead and I meant
them to slay me also

Did youmiss meso greatly she questioned and not looking at me

Yes

You fought them in Skeleton Cove beyond Deliverance Martin

Aye You found their guns there

And the sand all trampled and hatefully stained Tis an evil place
Martin

And so it is says I But as to these weapons there were two good
firelocks I mind and besides

They are all here Martin guns and swords and pistols You raved for
them in your sickness so I fetched them while you slept Though indeed
you have no need of these there be weapons of every sort in the
Treasure cave tis like an arsenal

Ha with good store of powder and shot comrade

Yes Martin

How many weeks have I lain sick comrade

Nay twas only four days

At this I fell to marvelling that so much of agony might be endured in
so little time

And youtended me Damaris

Why to be sure Martin

And so saved my life

So I pray may it be a life lived to noble purpose Martin

And now I sat awhile very thoughtful and watched her shape the dough
into little cakes and set them to bake

I must contrive you an oven and this at once says I

When you are strong again Martin

Nay Im well thanks to your care of me And truly twill be
wonderful to eat bread again

But I warned you I had no yeast says she looking at me a little
anxiously Nay sir why must you smile

Tis strange to see you at such labour and clad so vastly fine

Indeed sir needs must this your cookmaid go bedight like any queen
since nought is there in Black Bartlemys Treasure that is not
sumptuous and splendid Have you no desire to behold these wonders for
yourself

Not a tittle says I

But Martin three months are nigh sped and Master Penfeather not
come and according to his letter threequarters of this great
treasure is yours

Why then my lady I do freely bestow it on you

Nay this have I taken already because I needed it look So saying
she drew a comb from her hair and showed me how it was all fashioned of
wrought gold and set with great gems pearls and sapphires and rubies
marvellous to see

Tis mighty handsome quoth I and beyond price I judge

And yet says she I would rather have my wooden pin in its stead
for surely there was none like to it in all this world

Hereupon groping in my pocket I brought out that threepronged pin I
had carved for her beholding which she uttered a little cry of glad
surprise and letting fall her golden comb took the pin to turn it
this way and that viewing it as it had been the very wonder of the
world rather than the poor thing it was

Why Martin says she at last Why Martin where found you this
So I told her and though my words were lame and halting I think she
guessed somewhat of the agony of that hour for I felt her hand touch
my shoulder like a caress

Deaths shadow hath been over us of late Martin says she and hath
made us wiser methinks

Death says I Tis mayhap but the beginning of a greater life
wherein shall be no more partings I pray

Tis a sweet thought Martin

And you have never feared death says I

Aye but I do MartinI do cries she I am grown craven these
days mayhap

Yet you sought death

Because there was no other way Martin But when Death clutched at me
from those black depths I agonised for life

Is life thenbecome sosweet to you Damaris

Yes Martin says she softly

Since when I questioned Since when But instead of answering she
falls asinging softly and keeping her back to me thus I saw that she
had set the pin back in her hair whereat I grew all suddenly and
beyond reason glad Though indeed the thing accorded but ill with her
fine gown as I told her forthwith

Think you so Martin says she gravely but with a dimple in her
cheek

I do Tis manifestly out of keeping with your broideries your
pleats tags lappets pearlbuttons galoons and the rest ont

Twould almost seem you do not like me thus says she frowning down
at her finery but with the dimple showing plainer than ever

Why truly says I stooping to take up the jewelled comb where it
lay I liked your ragged gown better

Because your own clothes are so worn and sorry sir Tis time you
had better I must see to it

Nay never trouble

Twill be joy says she sweetly but setting her chin at me And
thengood lack your hair Martin

What of it

All elflox And then your beard

What o my beard

So wild and shaggy And tis so completely out o the mode

Mode says I frowning

Mode Martin Your spade beard was then came your dagger or stiletto
and now

Hum says I It may be your broadsword or halfpike for aught I
care But as to yon gown

Alas poor thing Twill soon look worn and ragged as you can wish
Martin I have already lost three pearl studs and should grieve for
them were there not a coffer full of better that I wot of O Martin
when I think of all these wonders these great diamonds emeralds
sapphires pearls and rubiesI do tingle

And can these toys so please you says I

Yes cries she Yes and so would they any other that was not a
stock or a stone orMartin Conisby who is above such vanities

Vanities indeed says I In this wilderness more especially

How if we should find the world again

Hum says I But this powder and shot now

Pho cries she and stamping her foot turns her back on me Here am
I yearning to show you all these hidden marvels Martin but I never
will until you beg meno never And now tis time you took your
medicine

What medicine I questioned wondering

Tis a soothing draught I have decocted from some of my simplesit
will make you sleep

But I have no mind to sleep

Tis why you must drink your potion

Never in this world says I mighty determined

Why yes you will dear Martin says she gently but setting her
dimpled chin at me Ill go fetch it And away she goes forthwith
and is presently back bearing an embossed cup like unto a little
porringer and of gold curiously ornamented

Here is a noble cup says I

In these secret caves Martin is nothing that is not beautiful The
walls are all hung with rich arras the floors adorned with marvellous
rugs and carpets And there are many pictures excellent well painted
Pirate and wicked as he was Black Bartlemy understood and loved
beautiful things

Aye he did so says I scowling

And amongst these pictures is one of himself

How should you know this

Because were you shaven Martin this might pass for picture of you
though to be sure your expression is differentexcept when you scowl
as you do now sir Come take your medicine like a good Martin And
here she sets the cup to my lips

No says I

Yes Martin Tis sleep you need and sleep you shall have For
indeed I do long to hear you at work again and whistling So drink it
for my sake Martin Indeed tis none so very bitter

So in the end I swallowed the stuff to be done with it And in a while
sure enough I grew drowsy and limping into the cave stared to
behold my bed no longer a heap of bracken but a real bed with sheets
and pillows such indeed as I had not slept in for many a long day
Thus instead of throwing myself down all dressed as I had been
minded I laid aside my rough clothes lest they soil this dainty gear
and getting into bed joyed in the feel of these cool white sheets
and closing my eyes fell to dreamless slumber



CHAPTER XL

OF CLOTHES

I awoke late next morning to find my clothes clean gone and others in
their place but garments these whose like I had never seen For here
were purple breeches belaced and ribbanded at the knee and buttoning
there with great gold buttons six a side and each set with a great
pearl a fine cambric shirt a doublet cut in at the waist with
goldbraided lappets the sleeves slashed and very wide and turned up
at the wrists with pointlace and this wondrous garment fastening in
front with many gold buttons all set with goodly pearls so that I
judged this coat to be a very fortune in itself Besides this I found
a great lace collar or falling band a pair of silk stockings shoes
with gold buckles set with diamonds and a great penthouse of a hat
adorned with a curling feather fastened by a diamond brooch whiles
hard by was an embroidered shoulderbelt carrying a long rapier its
guards and quillons of wrought gold its pommel flaming with great
brilliants Beholding all of which gauds and fopperies I vowed Id
none of them and cowering beneath the sheets fell to shouting and
hallooing for my lady but finding this vain scowled at these garments
instead They were of a fashion such as I remembered my father had
worn and now as I gazed on them a strange fancy took me to learn how I
that had gone so long halfnaked and in rags might feel in such
sumptuous apparel So up I got and dressed forthwith and found this a
matter of no small difficulty what with the unfamiliar shape of these
garments and their numberless points and buttons Howbeit twas done at
last and now coming without the cave there was my lady upon her
threelegged stool preparing breakfast Beholding me she stared
wideeyed for a moment then rose smiling roguishly and sank down in
a slow and gracious curtsey

Good morrow to your lordship says she Your lordship called I
think but I could not answer your lordships shouts since I was busied
preparing your lordships breakfast

Now beholding all the sweet and roguish witchery of her the sun so
bright and the world about us so joyous what could I do but smile and
sweeping off my great hat make her as deep and profound a reverence as
ever was seen at Whitehall or Versailles

Madame quoth I your ladyships most humble and very obedient
servant I trust your ladyship hath breakfast ready for of a truth my
magnificence is mighty sharp set

O Martin cries she clapping her hands I vow twas most gallant
It needeth but for you to trim your hair and beardno I think I will
have you cleanshaven twill mind me of the boyish Martin of years
ago Yes you shall shave

Shave quoth I staring like any fool

Yes Martin I have all things ready Come it shall not take you
long we will breakfast when you are shaved and trimmed So
willynilly she brings me back to the cave and presently comes bearing
a goldmounted box wherein lay razors with soap and everything needful
to a fine gentlemans toilet Then she sets before me a goldframed
mirror and taking a pair of scissors at her bidding I began to clip
the hair from my face but so bungled the business that she presently
took the scissors and did it for me Thereafter I shaved awkwardly
enough and she mighty anxious lest I cut myselfthe which I did
and having at last washed and dried my face I stood all amazed to
find myself so much youngerlooking Now seeing how she stared at me
and with rosy lips all aquiver I smiled then wondered to behold her
eyes suddenly abrim with tears

O Martin you do look the same Martin after all says she and so away
into the sunshine yet when I presently joined her I found her blithe
enough

Are you hungry sir

Ravenous my lady

Why then here we have broiled fishcaught by my ladyshipsalt
Martin Butterchurned by my ladyshipandbread Martin Bread
baked by my ladyships own two hands

O marvellous sweet lady says I

And tis none so ill though I had no yeast is it Martin

Delicious says I my mouth full

And now all our recent woes and sorrows clean forgotten a right
joyous meal had we our hearts light as the sweet air that breathed
around us and untroubled as the placid ocean and broad serenity of
heaven with no dark shadow anywhere to warn us of those evils to come
Thus we ate and talked finding joy in everything Often my fingers
must go to feel my smooth cheeks and chin and she catching me must
needs laugh and vow a smooth face suited me well and that I should be
handsome were my nose another shape and my eyes a different colour
Thus as I say brooding sorrow seemed clean vanished from my world so
that my heart swelled with gratitude for that I should live to breathe
the air she made sweet

Breakfast done I fetched my saw and despite her remonstrances and my
resplendent breeches forthwith set about making a cupboard vowing I
was well again that I never felt better etc Hereupon finding me set
on it she presently brings me the following viz an excellent new
saw divers chisels of goodly edge a plane a hammer an auger and an
adze the which rejoiced me greatly more especially the adze the
which is an exceeding useful tool in skilled hands All these she had
brought from the secret store and I mighty grateful therefor and told
her so

Why then Martin says she if your gratitude be real and true you
shall do somewhat for me

What you will says I eagerly

Nay she laughed tis no more than thiskeep you
shavedhenceforth

And so it was agreed



CHAPTER XLI

OF THE VOICE THAT SANG ON DELIVERANCE SANDS

If clothes be the outward and visible albeit silent expression of a
man his tastes and certain attitudes of his mind yet have they of
themselves a mighty influence on their wearer being as it were an
inspiration to him in degree more or less

And this is truth I will maintain let say who will to the contrary
since tis so my experience teacheth me

Hitherto my ragged shirt my rough leathern jerkin and openkneed
sailors breeches had been a constant reminder of the poor desperate
rogue I had become my wild hair and shaggy beard evidences of
slavedom Thus I had been indeed what I had seemed in looks a rude
ungentle creature expectant of scorns and illusage and therefore very
prone to fight and quarrel harshtongued bitter of speech and in all
circumstances sullen ungoverned and very desperate

But now seeing myself thus gently dight my wild hair tamed by comb
and scissors there grew within me a new respect for my manhood so
that little by little those evils that slavery had wrought slipped
from me Thus though I still laboured at my carpentry and such
business as was to do yet the fine linen rolled high above my scarred
and knotted arm put me to the thought that I was no longer the poor
wild wretch full of despairing rage against Fate her cruel dealings
but rather a man gently born and therefore one who must endure all
things as uncomplainingly as might be and one moreover who to greater
or less degree was master of his own fate

And now came Hope that most blessed and beneficent spirit that lifteth
the fallen from the slough that bindeth up the broken heart that
cheereth the sad and downcast and maketh the oftdefeated bold and
courageous to attempt Fortune yet again

O thou that we call Hope thou sweet bright angel of God Without thee
life were an evil unendurable with thee for companion gloomy Doubt
sullen Fear and dark Despair flee utterly away and we boldhearted
patient and undismayed by any dangers or difficulties may realise our
dreams at last O sweet strong angel of God with thee to companion
us all things are possible

Thus every morning came Hope to greet me on my waking and I
forgetting the futile past began to look forward to a future more
glorious than I had ever dreamed so I from a sullen rogue full of
black humours grew to know again the joy of laughter and put off my
ungracious speech and ways with my rough attire Though how much the
change thus wrought in me was the work of my sweet comrade these pages
I do think will show

As for my lady she very quick to mark this change grew ever the more
kind and trusting sharing with me all her doubts and perplexities
thus did some problem vex her she must come to me biting her pretty
lips and her slender brows wrinkled to ask my advice

At this time and at her suggestion I builded a fireplace and oven
within our third or inmost cave that was by turns her larder
stillroom dairy and kitchen and with a chimney to carry off the smoke
the which I formed of clay and large pebbles and found it answer very
well Thus what with those things I contrived and others she brought
from her treasurehouse the secret whereof she kept mighty close we
lacked for nothing to our comfort even as Adam had promised in his
letter Moreover I was very well armed both for offence and defence
for one by one she brought me the following pieces viz a Spanish
helmet inlaid with gold and very cumbersome a back and breast of fine
steel of proof four wheellock arquebuses curiously chased and
gilded with shot and powder for the same three brace of pistols
goldmounted and very accurate and what with these my sword axe and
trusty knife I felt myself capable to drive away any should dare
molest us be he Indian buccaneer or pirate as I told her

Aye but says she whiles you fought for our lives what must I be
doing

Lying secure within your secret treasurehouse

Never says she setting her chin at me O never Martin since I am
your comrade my place must be beside you

Twould but distress me and spoil my shooting

Why then my aim should be truer Martin Come now teach me how to
use gun and pistol

So then and there I fetched a pistol and one of the arquebuses and
showed her their manage namelyhow to hold them to level sight
etc Next I taught her how to charge them how to wad powder and then
shot lest the ball roll out of the barrel how having primed she must
be careful ever to close the pan against the priming being blown away
All of the which she was mighty quick to apprehend Moreover I took
care to keep all my firearms cleaned and loaded that I might be ready
for any disturbers of our peace

So the days sped each with its meed of work but each fullcharged of
joy And dear to me beyond expressing is the memory of those days
whenas I labouring with my new tools had but to lift my head to
behold my dear comrade herself busy as I Truly how dear how
thriceblessed the memory of it all A memory this indeed that was
to become for me sacred beyond all others for now came Happiness with
arms outstretched to me and I poor blind wretch suffered it to plead
in vain and pass me by as you shall hear

It was a night of splendour with a full moon uprising in majesty to
fill the world with her soft radiance a night very warm and still and
we silent I think because of the tender beauty of the night

Martin says my companion softly at last here is another day sped

Alas and mores the pity quoth I

O says she looking at me askance

Our days fly all too fast Damaris here is a time I fain would linger
upon an I might

It hath been a very wonderful time truly Martin and hath taught me
very much We are both the better for it I think and you

What of me comrade I questioned as she paused

You are grown so much gentler since your sickness so much more my
dear friend and companion

Why tis all your doing Damaris

I am gladO very glad says she almost in a whisper

Why tis you who have taught me toto love all good sweet things
to rule myself that II may some day mayhap be a little more worthy
ofof here beginning to flounder I came to sudden halt and
casting about in my mind for a likely phrase saw her regarding me the
dimple in her cheek but her eyes all compassionate and ineffably
tender

Dear man says she and reached me her hand

Damaris says I heavily and looking down at these slender fingers
yet not daring to kiss them lest my passion sweep me away you know
that I do love you

Yes Martin

And that my love be it what it may is yet an honest love

Yes dear Martin

Here was silence a while she looking up at the moon and I at her

I broke my oath to you once says I nor will I swear again but
dear my lady know this though I do hunger and thirst for you yet
mine is such reverent love that should we live thus together long
yearsaye until the end of our lives I will school myself to
patience and wait ever upon your will Though twill be hard says I
twixt my teeth thrilling to the sudden clasp of her fingers

But Martin says she softly how if our days together here should
all suddenly end

End cries I starting Wherefore end When Why end And I
trembled in a sick panic at the mere possibility End quoth I
again Would you have an end

Noah no says she leaning to me that I could look down into her
eyes

Doth thisO Damaris can this mean that you are happy with me in this
solitudecontent

So happy Martin so content that I do fear lest it may all suddenly
end and vanish like some loved dream

DamarisO Damaris says I kissing her sweet fingers Look now
there is question hath oft been on my lips yet one I have it dared to
ask

Ask me now Martin

Tis this  could it  might it perchance be possible you should
learn with time  mayhap  to love me a little Nay not a little
not gently nor with reason but fiercely mightily beyond the cramping
bounds of all reason

Now here she laughed a small sad laugh with no mirth in it and
leaned her brow against my arm as one very weary

O foolish Martin she sighed How little you have seen how little
guessedhow little you know the real me For I am a woman Martin as
you are a man and joy in it All these months I have watched you
growing back to your nobler self I have seen you strive with yourself
for my sake and gloried in your victories though  sometimes I have
 tempted you  just a little Martin Nay wait dear Martin
Ofttimes at night I have known you steal forth and hearkened to your
step going to and fro out in the dark and getting to my knees have
thanked God for you Martin

Twas not all in vain then says I hoarsely bethinking me of the
agony of those sleepless nights

Vain she cried Vain Tis for this I do honour you

Honourme says I wincing

Above all men Martin Tis for this I

Wait says I fronting her all shamefaced I do love you so greatly
I would not have you dream me better than I am So now must I tell you
this  I stole to you once  at midnight  you were asleep the
moonlight all about you and looked like an angel of God

And now it was my turn to stare up at the moon whiles I waited
miserably enough for her answer

And when you went away Martin says she at last when I heard you
striding to and fro out here beneath Gods stars I knew that yours
was the greatest noblest love in all the world

Yousaw me

Yes Martin

Yet your eyes were fast shut

Yes but notnot all the time And O Martin dear dear Martin I
saw your great strong arms reach out to take mebut they didnt they
didnt because true love is ever greatly merciful And your triumph
was mine also Martin And so it is I love youworship you and needs
must all my days

And now we were on our feet her hands in mine eyes staring into eyes
and never award to speak

Is it true says I at last God Damarisis it true

Seems it so wonderful dear Martin Why this love of mine reacheth
back through the years to Sir Martin my little knighterrant and hath
grown with the years till now it filleth me and the universe about me
Have you forgot twas your picture hung opposite my bed at home your
sword I kept bright because it had been yours And often Martin here
on our dear island I have wept sometimes for love of you because it
pained me so Nay wait beloved first let me speak though I do
yearn for your kisses But this night is the greatest ever was or
mayhap ever shall be and we alone here in the wild do lie beyond all
human laws soever save those of our great loveand O Martin youyou
do love me

Now when I would have answered I could not so I sank to my knees and
stooping ere she knew clasped and kissed the pretty feet of her

No Martinbeloved ah no cries she as it were pain to her and
kneeling before me set her soft arms about my neck Martin says
she as we kneel thus in this wilderness alone with God here and now
before your lips touch mine before your dear strong hands take me to
have and hold forever so great and trusting is my love I ask of you no
pledge but this Swear now in Gods sight to renounce and put away all
thought of vengeance now and for ever swear this Martin

Now I all bemused by words so unexpected all dazzled as it were by
the pleading passionate beauty of her closed my eyes that I might
think

Give me until tomorrow I groaned

Twill be too late Choose now Martin

Let me think

Tis no time for thought Choose Martin This hour shall never come
again so Martinspeak now or

The words died on her lip her eyes opened in sudden dreadful amaze
and thus we remained kneeling rigid in one anothers arms for away
across Deliverance deep and full and clear a voice was singing

 There are two at the fore
 At the main are three more
 Dead men that swing all in a row
 Heres fine dainty meat
 For the fishes to eat
 Black BartlemyBartlemy ho



CHAPTER XLII

CONCERNING THE SONG OF A DEAD MAN

Long after the singing was died away I like one dazed could think of
nought but this accursed song these words the which had haunted my
sickbed and methought no more than the outcome of my own fevered
imagination thus my mind running on this and very full of troubled
perplexity I suffered my lady to bring me within our refuge but with
my ears on the stretch as expectant to hear again that strange deep
voice sing these words I had heard chanted by a dead man in my dreams

Being come within our third cave or kitchen my lady shows me a small
cord that dangled in certain shadowy corner and pulling on this cord
down falls a ropeladder and hangs suspended and I knew this for
Adams ladder of cords whereby he had been wont to mount into his
fourth and secret cavern as mentioned in his chronicle

Here lieth safety Martin says my lady for as Master Penfeather
writes in his journal one resolute man lying upon the hidden ledge
up yonder may withstand a whole army so long as his shot last And
you are very resolute and so am I

True says I True Yet even as I spake stood all tense and
rigid straining my ears to catch again the words of this hateful song
But now my dear lady catches my hand and peering up at me in the
dimness presently draws me into the outer cave where the moon made a
glory

O Martin says she looking up at me with troubled eyes Dear
Martin what is it

Ayewhat quoth I wiping sweat from me God knoweth But you
heard That song The words

I heard a man singing Martin But what of itwe are safe here
Ahwhy are you so strange

Damaris says I joying in the comfort of her soft strong arms about
me dear love of mine here is thing beyond my understanding for
these were words I dreamed sung to me by a dead manthe man
Humphreyout beyond the reef

Nay but dear Martin this was a real voice Tis some shipwrecked
mariner belike some castaway

Ayebut did youmark these words Damaris

NayO my dear how should Iat such a moment

They were allof Black Bartlemy And what should this mean think
you

Nay dear love never heed says she clasping me the closer

Aye but I must Damaris forin a while this singing shall come
again mayhap andif it dothI know what twill be

O MartinMartin what do you mean

I mean twill be about the poor Spanish lady says I and catching up
my belt where it hung I buckled it about me

Ahwhat would you do Martin

Im for Deliverance

Then will I come also

No says I catching her in fierce arms No You are mine
henceforth and more precious than life to me So must you bide hereI
charge you by our love For look now tis in my mind Tressady and his
pirates are upon us at last those same rogues that dogged the
Faithful Friend over seas Howbeit I must find out who or what is it
is that sings this hateful I stopped all at once for the voice was
come again nearer louder than before and singing the very words I
had been hearkening for and dreading to hear

 Theres a fine Spanish dame
 And Joannas her name
 Shall follow wherever ye go
 Till your black heart shall feel
 Yow cursed steel
 Black BartlemyBartlemy ho


You heard says I clapping hand on knife You heard

Yesyes she whispered her embrace tightening until I might feel
her soft body all atremble against mine But you are safehere
Martin

So safe says I that needs must I go and find out this thingnay
never fear beloved life hath become so infinite precious that I shall
be a very cowarda craven for your sake Here shall be no fighting
Damaris but go I must Meanwhile do you wait me in the secret cave
and let down the ladder only to my whistle

But now and lying all trembling in my embrace she brake into
passionate weeping and I powerless to comfort her

Farewell happiness she sobbed Only Martin dear Martin
whatsoever may chance know and remember always that I loved and shall
love you to the end of time

Then and all suddenly she was her sweet calm self again and
bringing me my chainshirt insisted I must don it there and then
beneath my fine doublet the which to please her I did Then she
brought me one of the arquebuses but this I put by as too cumbersome
taking one of the pistols in its stead So armed with this together
with my hatchet and trusty knife I stepped from the cave and she
beside me And now I saw she had dried her tears and the hand clasping
mine was firm and resolute so that my love and wonder grew

Damaris I cried casting me on my knees before her O God how I do
love thee And kneeling thus I clasped her slender loveliness
kissing the robes that covered her and so rising to my feet I hasted
away Yet in a little I turned to see her watching me but with hands
clasped as one in prayer Now beholding her thus I was seized of a
sudden great desire to go back to give her that promise and swear that
oath she sought of me viz that I would forego my vengeance and all
thought thereof forgetting past wrongs in the wonder of her love
But even as I stood hesitating she waved her hand in farewell and was
gone into the cave



CHAPTER XLIII

OF THE DEATHDANCE OF THE SILVER WOMAN

A small wind had sprung up that came in fitful gusts and with sound
very mournful and desolate but the moon was wonderfully bright and
though I went cautiously my hand on the butt of the pistol in my
girdle yet ever and always at the back of my mind was an infinitude of
joy by reason of my dear ladys love for me and the wonder of it

I chose me a devious course avoiding the white sands of Deliverance
Beach trending towards that fatal cleft hard by Bartlemys tree the
which we had come to call Skeleton Cove though why I must go hither I
knew no more then than I do now

Thus went I my eyes and ears on the stretch pondering what manner of
man this should be who sang words the which had so haunted my sick
dreams more than once I stopped to stare round about me upon the wide
expanse of ocean dreading and half expecting to behold the loom of
that black craft had dogged us over seas

Full of these disquieting thoughts I reached the cove and began to
descend the steep side following goattracks long grown familiar The
place hereabouts was honeycombed with small caves and with ledges
screened by bushes and tangled vines and here well hid from
observation I paused to look about me But and all in a moment I
was down on my knees for from somewhere close by came the sharp
snapping of a dried stick beneath a stealthy foot

Very still I waited every nerve atingle and then forth into the
moonlight sudden and silent as death a man crept and verily if ever
murderous death stood in human shape it was before me now The man
stood halfcrouching his head twisted back over his shoulder as
watching one who followed beneath the vivid scarf that swathed his
temples was a shock of red hair and upon his cheek the sweat was
glittering then he turned his head and I knew him for the man Red
Andy that same I had fought aboard ship For a long moment he stood
thus staring back ever and anon across Deliverance and so comes
creeping into the shadow of the cliff and I saw the moon glint on the
barrel of the long pistol he clutched as sinking down behind a great
boulder he waited there upon his knees

Now suddenly as I lay there watching Red Andys murderous figure and
strung for swift action I started and albeit the night was very warm
felt a chill pass over me as loud and clear upon the stilly air rose
again that full deep voice singing hard by upon Deliverance

 Go seek ye women everywhere
 North South lads East or West
 Let em be dark let em be fair
 My Silver Womans best
 Blow high blow low
 Where eer ye go
 The Silver Womans best
 Aha
 My Silver Womans best


Thus sang the unknown who all unwitting was coming to his death
sudden as it came the voice was hushed and nought to hear save the hiss
and murmur of the surge and I saw the man Andy stir restlessly as
minute after minute dragged by

The rock where he crouched lay at the mouth of this cove towards
Deliverance it being one of many that lay piled thereabout Now
chancing to look towards these scattered rocks and for no reason in
the world I saw a thing that held me as it were spellbound and this a
small enough thing in itself a sharp glittering thing that seemed
fast caught in a fissure of one of those rocks and I knew it for a
steel hook but even as I stared at it the thing was gone and so
noiselessly that I halfdoubted if I had seen it or no But out from
the shadow of this rock flashed something that whirled glittering as
it flew and Red Andy starting up from his knees was shaken by a fit
of strange and awful coughing and came stumbling forward so that I
could see his chin and breast bedabbled with the blood that spurted
from his gaping mouth All at once he sank to his knees and thence to
his face spreading his arms wide like one very weary but with the
moonlight flashing back from that which stood upright betwixt his
shoulderblades And thus I saw again the silver haft of the dagger
that was shaped like to a woman saw this silver woman dance and leap
glittering ere it grew terribly still

Then came Roger Tressady from the shadows and stooping turned up the
dead face to the moon and tapped it gently with his shining hook And
now whipping out his dagger he bent to wipe it on the dead mans
shirt but checked suddenly as a pebble started beneath my foot and
stooped thus he glared up beneath thick brows as I rose up with pistol
levelled and the moon bright upon my face whereupon he leaped
backwards uttering a choking cry

Black Bartlemyby God he gasped and let fall his reeking dagger
upon the sand and so we stood staring on each other and with the dead
man sprawling betwixt us



CHAPTER XLIV

HOW I HAD SPEECH WITH ROGER TRESSADY TO MY UNDOING

For maybe a full minute we fronted each other unmoving and with never a
word and thus at last I beheld this man Tressady

A tall lusty fellow square of face and with pale eyes beneath a jut
of shaggy brow A vivid neckerchief was twisted about his head and in
his hairy ears swung great gold rings his powerful right hand was
clenched to knotted fist in place of his left glittered the deadly
hook

Sink me says he at last drawing clenched fist across his brow
Sink me but ye gave me a turn my lord Took ye for a ghost I did
the ghost of a shipmate o mine one as do lie buried yonder nought
but poor bonesaye rotten bonesas this will be soon Here he
spurned the dead man with his foot Tis black rogue this my lord
one as would ha made wormsmeat o poor Tressadyaye a lump o
murdered clay like my shipmate Bartlemy yonderbut for this Silver
Woman o mine Here he stooped for the dagger and having cleaned it
in the sand held it towards me upon his open palm Aha heres woman
hath never failed me yet Shes faithful and true friend faithful
and true this Silver Woman o mine But tis an ill world my master
and full o bloody rogues like this sly dog as stole ashore to murder
methe fool O tis a black and bloody world

So it is quoth I twixt shut teeth And all the worse for the
likes o you Roger Tressady

So hohe knoweth my name then says Tressady rubbing shaven chin
with silver daggerhilt and viewing me with his pale keen gaze But
do I know him nowdo I

I know you for pirate and damned murderer Roger Tressady so shall
you quit this island this very hour or stay here to rot along with
Bartlemy and Red Andy

Now at this and all careless of my pistol he drew a slow pace nearer
great head outthrust peering

Why says he at last whybleed me Ifif it arentaye
tisMartin Why for sure tis my bonnet Marty as saved my skin time
and again aboard the Faithful Friend Though ye go mighty fine lad
mighty fine But good luck tye and a fair wind say I And
thrusting the dagger into his girdle he nodded mighty affable But
lookee now Marty heres me wishing ye well and you wi a barker in
your fist tis no fashion to greet a shipmate Im thinking

Enough words says I stepping up to him Do you goalive or stay
here deadwhich

Split me says he never stirring But tis small choice you offer
Marty

My names Martin

And a curst good name too Marty But Ive no mind to be wormsmeat
yet awhileno Come whats your quarrel wi me First Andy would
murder me and now tis youwhy for Heres me wi a heart of gold t
cherish a friend and never a friend t cherish Whats your quarrel
lad what

Quarrel enough what with your drugging me and murder aboard ship

Avast lad Heres unchancy talk ill and unmannered

You murdered divers men aboard the Faithful Friend

Only three Marty only threepoor souls Though yours is a foul
word fort I took em off lad took em off as a matter of policy
Ive never took off any yet as I wasnt forced to by circumstances
Lookee theres men in this world born to be took off by someone or
other and they always come adrifting across my hawse and get took off
accordingly but dont blame me lad dont And as for adrugging of
ye Marty true again But love me What was I to do But I didnt
take you off lad no nor never shall unless you and policy force me
so to do Im no murderer bornlike Adamcurse him Clap me
alongside Adam and Im a turtledove a babe for innocence and a lamb
for meekness There never was such a murderer born into this wicked
world as Adam Penfeather with a curse Twas he as murdered Black
Bartlemy and nine sweet bright lads arter him murdered em here one
by one and wi a parchment rove about the neck of each poor corpse
Marty Twas he as drove their mates out to sea to perish in a leaky
boatask Abnegation Mings Twas him nigh murdered me more than once
aye me lad as cant BE killed according to the prophecy of the poor
mad soul aboard the old Delight Why Adam curse him has murdered
more men than you have years And talking of him how cometh it you
arent blown t hell along wi him and the rest

Do you tell me Adam is dead

Blown up aboard the Faithful Friend lad Just after we run her
aboard and grappled aye blew up she did and nigh took us wi her
Aha but Adams dead at last curse him Unless he cant be killed
either unless he is

Here and all at once he turned to stare away across Deliverance then
shrinking cowered towards me as in sudden terror stabbing at the empty
air with his glittering hook

Hawhats yon cried he in awful voice and I turning whither his
glaring eyes stared and halfdreading to behold my lady had the
pistol wrenched from my hold and the muzzle under my ear all in a
moment and stood scowling and defenceless like the vast fool I was

Split me says he tapping me gently with his hook O blind me if I
thought ye such a lubberly fool So old a trick Marty Now lookee
were I a murderer and loved itlike Adam curse himI should pull
trigger But being Roger Tressady wi a heart o gold I say sit down
lad sit down and let us talk friend let us talk Comesit down
Never mind Andy he shant trouble us So with the pistol at my ear
we sat down side by side and the dead man sprawling at our feet

Now first Marty lad how come ye here alone on Bartlemys
islandhow

But sitting thus chin on fist I stared down at Red Andys stiffening
body silent as he I being too full of fierce anger and bitter scorn of
my folly for speech

Come come Marty be sociable says Tressady tapping my cheek with
the pistolmuzzle Was it Penfeather sent ye hither t give an eye
tothe treasure Was it

Aye

Twould be the night he made the crew drunk and spoiled my plans Ha
twas like hima cunning rogue But for this Id have had the ship
and him and the treasure O a right cunning fierce rogue was Adam
and none to match him but me

But he nearly did for you once says I bitterly And he such a
small timid man

Lookee Martin when Adam grows timid tis time for your bold
desperate fellows to beware But hes dead at last though Id ha
felt more comfort aye Id ha took it kinder had he been took off by
my Silver Womanor this Here he thrust his hook before my eyes
It aint a pretty thing Martin not pretty nobut tis useful at
all times and serves to shepherd my lambs wi now and then tis
likewise a mighty persuading argument but and best of alltis sure
lad sure So Id ha took it kinder had I watched him go off on this
lad this My hook for my enemies and for my friends a heart o gold
And talking o gold Marty whatwhat o Bartlemys Treasure

You are happily welcome to it for all me

Why thats spoke manly and like a friend rot me but it is And now
where might it lie Marty where

Ive no idea

What hant ye found it lad

No

Not evenseen it then

No

Why think o that now think of that And you wia fortun o
pearls on you Marty These pearl studs and buttons lad Pearlsha
pearls was meat and drink to Bartlemy And heres you wi pearls Ive
seen on Bartlemy many a time And yet you hant found the treasure
says you If I was a passionate man Marty I should call ye liar
says I Howsoever what I do say isas youve forgot and very right
and proper But wem friends you and me so far and so twixt
friends I ask you to think again until you remember and to think
hard lad hard

Now as I sat and miserably enough staring down at my jewelled buttons
that seemed to leer up at me like so many small malevolent eyes upon
the air rose a distant stir that grew and grew to sound of voices with
the creak and rumble of oars

Here come my lambs at last Marty and among em some o the lads as
sailed wi Bartlemy aboard the Delight Theres Sam Spraggons for
oneSmiling Sam as youll mind aboard the Faithful Friend Now the
Smiler knoweth many and divers methods of persuasion Marty lad tricks
learned of the Indians as shall persuade a man to anything in this
world But first seeing tis you Martin as played bonnet to me
and saved my life aboard ship though all unknowing heres my offer
show me how to come by Bartlemys Treasure as is minemine by rights
let me get my hands on to it and none the wiser and there shall be
share for you Marty lad share for you Otherwise I must let Sam try
to persuade you to remember where it liethcome what dye say

Whatyoull torture me then

If I must friend if I must Tis for you to say

Why then twill be labour in vain Tressady for I swear I know nought
of this treasure

Sit still lad sit still says he clapping the pistol to my ear
again Though a fool in many ways Marty youre proper enough man to
look at and twill be pity to cripple ye Aye there wont be much
left when Sam is done wi you mores the pity

Hereupon he hailed loudly and was answered from the lagoon and
glancing thither I saw two boats crowded with men pulling for the
beach

A wildish company Martin desperate fellows as ever roved the Main
as I do love no more than they love me So say the word and well
share Black Bartlemys treasure betwixt us just you and me lad me
and you Come whats your will But shaking my head and hopelessly
enough I set my teeth and watched the coming of my tormentors

And foremost was a short plump brighteyed man who lacked an ear and
at his elbows two others the one a lank rogue with a patch over one
eye the third a tall hairy fellow

And observing them as they came I knew them for those same three rogues
I had fought with in the hedgetavern beside Pembury Hill on that night
I had first seen my dear lady Hard upon their heels came a riotous
company variously armed and accoutred who forthwith thronged upon me
pushing and jostling for sight of me desecrating the quiet night with
their hoarse and clamorous ribaldry Unlovely fellows indeed and clad
in garments of every shape and cut from stained home spun and tattered
shirts to velvet coats belaced and goldbraided and beholding this
tarnished and sordid finery these clothes looted from sinking ships
and blazing towns I wondered vaguely what had become of their late
owners

At gesture from Tressady I was dragged to my feet and my arms jerked
twisted and bound before me crosswise and so stood I helpless and in
much painful discomfort whiles Tressady harangued his fellows tapping
me gently with his hook

Lookee my bullies quoth he I promised ye gold a plenty and
here somewhere on this island it lieth waiting to be found It
needeth but for this fool Martin here as some o you will mind for
Adam Penfeathers comrade with a curse it needeth but for him to
speak I say and in that same hour each one o you may fill your
clutch wi more treasure than ever came out o Eldorado or Manoaso
speak he must and shalleh bullies eh

Aye aye Capn they roared pressing upon me with a shaking of
fists and glitter of eager steel

Twist his thumbs Capn cried one

Slit his nose roared another

Trim his yeres cried a third But Tressady silenced them with a
flourish of his hook

Harkee lads says he You all mean well but youre bunglers
heres a little delicate matter as none can handle like the Smiler
Theres none like Sam can make a man give tongue Pass the word for
Smiling Sam Step forward Sammy

Hereupon cometh the great fat fellow Spraggons who had been bosuns
mate aboard the Faithful Friend forcing his way with vicious elbows
and mighty anxious to come at me

O love my limbs says he in his highpitched voice and blinking his
hairless lids at me O cherish my gutsleave him to me Capn Sams
the lad to make this yer cock crow See nowa good sharp knife
neath the finger or toenailsdrew slow mates slow Or a hot iron
close agen his eyes is good Or boiling water poured in his yeres
might serve Thenaha Capn I know a dainty little trick a small
cord dye see twisted athwart his head just alow the brows twisted
and twistedas shall start his eyes out right pretty to behold I
mind too as Lollonais had a trick o bursting a mans guts wi water

Bring him to the beach yonder says Tressady watching me ever with
his pale eyes There shall be more room fort yonder

So they hailed me along betwixt them and with huge merriment but
scarce were we out of the cove and hard beside Bartlemys tree than I
started to the vicious prick of a knife and whirling about despite the
fierce hands that sought to hold me I saw Smiling Sam about to stab me
again But now as I strove with my reeling captors was a flicker of
vicious steel as Tressady sprang and whipping his hook beneath the
great fellows belt whirled Smiling Sam from his feet despite his
prodigious weight and forthwith trampled upon him

Soho my merry lad quoth Tressady glaring down into Smiling Sams
convulsed face And must ye be at it afore I give the word Whos
captain herewho Come speak up my roaring boy and he thrust his
hook beneath the Smilers great flabby chin

Mercy Capnmercy cried Spraggons his highpitched voice rising
to a pitiful squeal Not the hook CapnO Lord love menot the
hook

Hook And why not Sam why not Tis sharp and clean and quick and
hath done the business o nicer rogues than you bully aye and better
Sam better

O Capnfor Gods sake

Whore you to call on God so glib Sammy Tis marvel He dont strike
ye blind lad Or theres your innards Sam heres that may whip out
your liver ladSo I saw the glitter of the hook heard Smiling
Sams gasping scream as the steel bit into him and then Tressady was
on his feet smiling round upon his awed and silent company

Lookee bullies says he pointing to the Smilers inanimate form
Heres poor Sam all swounded away at touch o my hook like any
womanand him my bosun Pshaw I want a man Here he stooped and
wrenching the silver pipe from Smiling Sams fat throat stared from one
shuffling rogue to another Step forward Abner says he at last
Come youll doyoure a prime sailorman youre my bosun
henceforth

But now Smiling Sam awaking from his swoon moaned feebly and sat up

Not the hook Capn he wailed O not that

No Smiler no I keep it for better men Disobey me again and Ill
drown ye in a puddle And now up wi you Sammy up wi you and stand
by to teach Martin here how to talk

Aye aye Capnaye aye says the gross fellow rising nimbly
enough whiles his comrades closed about us expectant and glancing
from me to Tressady where he had seated himself on a boulder

Here will do says he pointing to a brilliant strip of moonlit sand
midway betwixt the shadows of the cliff and Bartlemys tree On his
back hearties and grapple him fast hes strong wellnigh as I am
Now his hand Smiler his right hand

Aye aye Capn quoth the fellow kneeling above me where I lay
helpless Will I cut it adriftslow like And as he flourished his
knife I saw a trickle of saliva at the corners of his great loose
mouth Off at the wrist Capn or fingers first

No fool His thumbnail firsttry that

Sweating and with every nerve aquiver I watched that cruel knife
holding my breath in expectation of the coming agony and thenfrom
the black gloom of the cliff beyond burst a sudden echoing roar I
heard the whine of a bullet and immediately all was confusion and
uproar shouts of dismay and a wild rush for shelter from this sudden
attack But as I struggled to my knees Tressadys great hand gripped
my throat and dragging me behind a boulder he pinned me there

Stand by lads he roared Level at the cliff yonder but let no
man pull trigger Wait till they fire again and mark the flash

Helpless in my bonds and crushed beneath Tressadys knee I heard a stir
and rustle to right and left of me the click of cocking triggers and
thereaftersilence And marking the gleam of pistol and
musketbarrel I fell to an agony of dread well knowing whence that
merciful shot had come For mayhap five minutes nought was to hear
save the rustle of stealthy arm or leg and the sound of heavy
breathing until at length one spoke loudvoiced

What now Captain Us cant bide here all night

How many are we Purdy

Thirty and nine Captain

Then do you take ten and scale the starboard cliff and you Abner
with other ten take the cliff to larboard Ill bide here wi the rest
and so well have em

Them cliffs be perilous high Capn

My hook is more perilous Tom Day Off wi you ye dogs or Ill show
ye a liver yet and be

He stopped all at once as faint at first yet most dreadful to hear
there rose a mans cry chilling the flesh with horror a cry that
waxed and swelled louder and louder to a hideous screaming that
shrilled upon the night and sinking to an awful bubbling murmur was
gone

Up sprang Tressady to stare away across Deliverance whence this
dreadful cry had come and I saw his hook taptapping at his great
chin then beyond these shining sands was the thunderous roar of a
great gun a furious rattle of smallarms that echoed and reechoed
near and far and thereafter single shots in rapid succession
Hereupon rose shouts and cries of dismay

Lord love us wem beset O Capn we be took fore and aft What shall
us do Capn Yon was a gun What o the ship Capnwhat o the
ship

Yonderlook yonder Who comes cried Tressady pointing towards
Deliverance Beach with his glittering hook

Twisting my head as I lay I looked whither he pointed and saw one
that ran towards us yet in mighty strange fashion reeling in wide
zigzags like a drunken man and sometimes he checked only to come on
again and sometimes he fell only to struggle up

By Godits Abnegation cries Tressady Tis my comrade Mings
Look to the prisoner ye dogsyou Tom Purdy Im for Abnegation
And off he went at a run At his going was mighty talk and discussion
what they should do some men being for stealing away in the boats
others for taking to the woods and all clean forgetting me where I
lay But suddenly they fell silent all for Abnegation was hailing
feebly and was come so nigh that we might see him his face all
bloody his knees bending under him with weakness as he stumbled on
Suddenly beholding Tressady he stopped and hailed him in wild
gasping voice

RogerO Roger The devils aboard us RogerPenfeathers on
usPenfeathers took the shipIm all thats left alive They killed
Sol firstdid yehear him die Roger O did ye hear

I saw him fall and Tressady run to lift him and watched these pirate
rogues as with oaths and cries of dismay they hasted hither to throng
about the two then rolling into the nearest shadow I struggled to my
feet and found myself beneath the spreading branches of Bartlemys
tree And now as I strove desperately against the rope that bit into
the flesh of me I felt the rope fall away felt two soft arms close
about me and a soft breath on my cheek

MartinO thank God Turning I caught my dear brave lady to my
heart Heedless of aught else in the world beside I clasped her in my
aching arms and kissed her until she stayed me and showing me where
stood our enemies a wild disordered company took my hand and began to
run Reaching the cliff we climbed together nor stayed until she had
brought me to a little cave where lay an arquebus together with
bandoliers I tried to reload it dear Martin but twas vainmy
poor silly hands shook so For O my dear Iheard themsaw them
andthought I should run madO Martin my love

So now whiles I loaded the arquebus I told her as well as I might
something of what I thought concerning her brave spirit of my undying
love for her though in fashion very lame and halting Thereafter the
weapon being ready I placed it near and sitting within the gloom of
this little cave I took my love into my arms her dear head pillowed
on my breast and kissed the tremors from her sweet mouth and the
horror from her eyes And thus with her arms about my neck and her
soft smooth cheek against mine we waited for what was to be



CHAPTER XLV

OF THE COMING OF ADAM PENFEATHER

In the shadow of the cliff below our hidingplace crept divers of these
pirate rogues and crouching there cheek by jowl fell to a hoarse
mutter of talk yet all too low for us to catch but presently there
brake out a voice highpitched the which I knew for that of Smiling
Sam

Wem done lads I tell ye O love my lightswem done Tis the
end o we since Penfeather hath took the shipand heres us shall lie
marooned to perish o plagues or Indiansavages or hunger unless
lads unless

Unless what Smiler questioned one eagerly

Unless wem up and doing Penfeather do lack for menMings says he
counted but ten at most when they boarded him Well mateswhat dye
say

Ha dye mean fight Smiler Fall on em by surprise and recapture
the shipha

O bless my gutsno Penfeather arent to be caught sonot him
Hell ha warped out from the anchorage by this But he be shorthanded
to work the vessel overseas tis aseekin o likely lads and prime
sailormen is Penfeather and we sits on these yere sands Well
mates on these yere sands we be but whats took up us on these yere
sands The boats lie yonder Well

Where be you heading of now Smiler Wheres the wind Talk plain

Why lookee all if Penfeather wants men as wants em he doth whats
to stay or let us from rowing out to Penfeather soft and quiet and
listing ourselves along of Penfeather and watch our chance t heave
Penfeather overboard and go aroving on our own account Well

At this was sudden silence and thereafter a fierce mutter of whispering
lost all at once in the clatter of arms and breathless scuffling as
they scrambled to their feet for there within a yard of them stood
Tressady hand grasping the dagger in his belt his glittering hook
tapping softly at his great chin as he stared from one to other of them

Ha my pretty lambs says he coming a pace nearer Will ye skulk
then will ye skulk with your fools heads together What now mutiny
is it mutiny And whats come o my prisoner Martin I dont spy him
hereabouts

Now at this they shuffled staring about and upon each other and as I
think missed me for the first time

You Tom Purdy step forwardso Now wheres the prisoner as I set
i your charge where my merry bird where

The fellow shrank away muttering some sullen rejoinder that ended in a
choking scream as Tressady sprang Then I knowing what was toward
clasped my lady to me covering her ears that she might not hear those
ghastly bubbling groans yet felt her sweet body shaking with the
horror that shook me

Sotheres an endo Tom Purdy my bullies gasped Tressady
stooping to clean his hook in the sand And I did itlookee
because he failed me once dye see Wholl be next Whos for
mutinyyou Sammy youha

Nono Capn piped Smiling Sam Us do be but contriving o ways
and means seeing as Penfeather do ha took our ship curse him

And what though he has Tis we have the island and tis on this
island lieth Black Bartlemys Treasure and tis the treasure were
after As to ways and means here we be thirty and eight to
Penfeathers fourteen and in a little twill be dark and the guns
shant serve em and thenaha look yonder The fools be coming into
our very clutches To cover lads and look to your primings and wait
my word

Now glancing whither he pointed I saw above the adjacent headland
the tapering spars of a ship Slowly she hove into view boltsprit
forecastle waist and poop until she was plain to view and I knew her
for that same black ship that fouled us in Deptford Pool She was
standing in for the island under her lower courses only although the
wind was very light but on she came and very slowly until she was so
near that I might see the very muzzles of her guns Suddenly with a
cheery yohoing her yards were braced round her anchor was let go and
she brought to opposite Skeleton Cove and within fair pistolshot

Now glancing below I saw Tressady stand alone and with Abnegation Mings
huddled at his feet but in the gloom of the cave and to right and
left in every patch of shadow and behind every bush and rock was the
glimmer of pistol or musketbarrel and all levelled in the one
direction

Presently up to the lofty poop of the ship clambered a short squat man
in marvellous wide breeches and a great cutlass on hip who clapping
speakingtrumpet to mouth roared amain

Ahoy the shore We be shorthanded Now what rogues o ye will turn
honest mariners and list aboard us for England Whos for a free
pardon and Old England

Hereupon from bush and shadow and rock I heard a whisper a murmur
and the word England oft repeated

Tressady heard it also and stepping forward he drew a long furrow in
the sand with the toe of his shoe

Lookee my hearty boys says he pointing to this furrow with his
hook the first man as setteth foot athwart this line I send to
hellfire along o Tom Purdy yonder

Ahoy the shore roared Godby louder than ever whos for an honest
life a free pardon and a share in Black Bartlemys Treasureor shall
it be a broadside Here be every gun full charged wi
musketballsand tis pointblank range Which shall it be

Once again rose a murmur that swelled to an angry muttering and I saw
Smiling Sam come creeping from the shadow of the cave

O Capn he piped Tis plaguy desperate business heres some on us
like to be bloody corpsesbut Im wi you Capn Roger whether or no
tis me to your back

To my back Sammy Why so you shall lad so you shall but Ill ha
your pistols first Smilerso And whipping the weapons from the
great fellows belt Tressady gave them to Abnegation Mings where he
lay in the shelter of a rock and sitting down crossed long legs and
cocked an eye at the heavens

Hearties all quoth he the moon sinketh apace and twill be ill
shooting for em in the dark so with dark tis us for the
boatsmuffled oarswe clap em aboard by the forechains larboard and
starboard and the ship is ours bulliesours

Well and good Capn piped Smiling Sam But how if she slip her
cable and stand from us

And how shall she my fool lad and the wind dropped The winds
failed em and they lie helpless

And thats gospel true Capn Aye aye wem wi you Gie us the
word Capn quoth divers voices in fierce answer

O sink me groaned Mings here lies poor Abnegation shattered alow
and aloftO burn me heres luck But youll take me along Roger
If Death boards me tonight Id rayther go in honest fight than lying
here like a sick dogso youll have me along Roger

Aye that will I lad that will I and

Ahoy the shore roared Godbys great voice again Let them
roguedogs asll turn honest mariners them as is for England and a
free pardon stand by to come aboard and lively In ten minutes we
open fire wi every gun as bears

Now here there brake forth a clamour of oaths cries and dismayed
questioning

Lord love us what now Capn Is us to be murdered lookee Doomed
men we be lads Shall us wait to be shot mates What shall us do
Capn what shall us do

Lie low quoth Tressady rising Bide still all and let no man stir
till I give word In half an hour or less twill be black darkvery
well for half an hour Ill hold em in parley Ill speak em smooth
and mighty friendly here shall be no shooting Ill hold em till the
moon be downand Smiler shall come wi mecome Sammy ladcome

So saying he turned and I watched him stride out upon that spit of sand
hard by Bartlemys tree and this great fat fellow trotting at his
heels Upon the edge of the tide Tressady paused and hailed loud and
cheerily

Penfeather ahoy O Adam Penfeather here come I Roger Tressady for
word wi you Lookee Adam weve fought and run foul of each other
this many a yearaye half round the world and all for sake o Black
Bartlemys Treasure as is mine by rights Adam mine by rights Well
now tonight lets you and me make an end once and for all one way or
tother Theres you wi my shiptrue Adam true But heres me wi
the island and the treasure Adam and the treasure And what then
Why then says I lets you and me either come to some composition or
fight it out man to man Adam man to man So come ashore Captain
Penfeatheryou as do be blacker pirate than ever was Bartlemycome
out yonder on the reef alone wi me and end it one way or tother Come
ashore Adam come ashore if ye dare adventure

Ahoy you Tressady roared Godby in reply Capn Adam is ashore wi
ye this momentlook astarn o you ye rogue

Round sprang Tressady as out from the dense shadow of Bartlemys tree
stepped Adam Penfeather himself He stood there in the moonlight very
still and viewing Tressady with head grimly outthrust his arms
crossed upon his breast a pistol in the fist and deadly menace in
every line of his small spare figure

Im here Tressady says he his voice ringing loud and clear And I
am come to make an end o you this night It hath been long
adoingbut I have ye at last Roger

Be ye sure Adam so sure

As death Tressady for I have ye secure at last

Bleed me but youre out there Adam youre out there The boots on
tother leg for hereabouts do lie thirty and eight o my lads watching
of ye this moment and wi finger on trigger

I know it says Adam nodding But theres never a one dare shoot
me for the first shot fired ashore shall bring a whole broadside in
answer dye see But as for you Tressady pray if you can for this
hour you hang

Hang is it Adam says Tressady and with swift glance towards the
sinking moon And whos to do itwho

There be thirty and eight shall swing ye aloft so soon as I give em
the word Tressady

You do talk rank folly Adam folly and ye know it says he smiling
and stealing furtive hand to the dagger in his girdle But and I
should die this night I take you along wi me and you can lay to
But he got no further for Smiling Sam and marvellous nimble whipped
up a stone and leaping on him from behind smote him two murderous
blows and staggering helplessly Tressady pitched forward upon his
face and lay upon the verge of the incoming tide

Beholding his handiwork Smiling Sam uttered a thin highshrilling
laugh and spitting upon that still form kicked it viciously

Oho Capn Penfeather cries he tis the Smiler hath saved ye the
labour lookee Tis Sam hath finished Tressady at last and be damned
t him And now tis the Smiler as do be first to list wi ye and
he began to shamble across the sands but passing that rock where
crouched Abnegation Mings he tripped and fell and I saw the flash of
Abnegations knife as they rolled and twisted in the shadow of this
rock whiles from this shadow rose a shrill crying like the wail of a
hurt child and into the moonlight came a great fat hand that clutched
and tore at the sand then grew suddenly still and with crooked fingers
plunged deep into the sand like a white claw Then tossing aside his
bloody knife Abnegation Mings struggled to his feet and came
staggering to kneel above his comrade Tressady and to turn up the
pallid face of him to the moon

And now Adam thrust away his pistols and with hands clasped behind him
turned to face the gloomy shadows of Skeleton Cove

Come out sons o dogs says he Step forward and show
yourselvesand lively it is Ensued a moments breathless pause
then from bush and shadow and rocks they stole forth these thirty and
eight and at Adams harsh command lined up before him shoulder and
shoulder Well says Adam pacing slowly along their rank to peer
into every sullen hangdog face Am I captain here Aye or no

Ayeaye they cried in eager chorus

And us was promised a free pardon Capn quoth one

And a share of the treasure Capn says another

And England Capn cried a third Theres some on us as do be
honest sailormen and forced to turn pirate in spite o we

Avast says Adam What I promise I stand by But mark this Let
any man fail of his duty to me but once and I shoot that man or hang
him out o handist understood

Aye aye Capntis agreed Well serve ye faithful and true they
cried

Why then bring ropes says Adam and with his new listed men at his
heels goes whither lay Tressady and with Abnegation Mings yet crouched
above him

What now was doing I might not see by reason of the crowd but I heard
the voice of Mings upraised in fierce invective and the throng
presently parting beheld him trussed hand and foot and dragged along
with Tressady towards Bartlemys tree There a noose was set about the
neck of each and the ropes ends cast over a branch But as at Adams
command these miserable wretches were hauled aloft to their deaths my
lady uttered a cry of horror and grasped my arm in desperate hands

Martin she panted O Martin tis horrible Save them this must
notshall not be

Tis but justice says I these men are pirates and murderers

This is no justice cries she breathlessly her face all pale and
drawn And these men are sore hurt besideAh Godlook Stop them
MartinO stop them Nay then I will And here or ever I could let
or stay her she begins to clamber down into the cove Howbeit quick
and surefooted though she was I was presently before her and so came
running knife in hand Nor was I any too soon for as I reached the
tree Tressady and Mings were dragged choking from their feet but
with a couple of strokes my keen knife had cut those deadly ropes
asunder and as the two fell gasping on the sand I turned to stare into
the scowling eyes of Adam Penfeather

Now as I stood thus someone spoke twixt sigh and groan
Bartlemytis Bartlemy and the word was taken up by others
BartlemyBlack Bartlemy and all men fell back from me whiles Adam
scowled at me above levelled pistol

Hold offAdam I panted Let be Adam Penfeatherlet be

What says he peering And is itMartin Lord love me now what
fools ploy is this

What you will quoth I only here has been enough of death for one
night

Tis but you do think so Martin and you was ever a fool I came
ashore to see these two rogues hang and hang they shall

Now look you Adam Penfeather says I scowling in turn you have
cozened and tricked me since first you crossed my path well let that
go But mark thisaccording to your letter threequarters of this
treasure is mine Very welltake it backIll buy these rogues
lives of you

Lord love me says he staring in blank amaze What new fool craze
is this Will ye save this bloody murderer Tressady that drugged ye
aboard ship the man that was our bane and plague all along The rogue
hath been my deadliest enemy seeking my destruction these fifteen
years and you would save him alive It seemeth my pistolbutt must ha
harmed what little brain you have and you be run stark staring mad
Martin

Howbeit says I mighty determined you dont hang these men whiles
I live

Why theres no difficulty either Martin for whats to stay me from
hanging you along with em or shooting you for the fool you are

I cried a voice and there betwixt us was my lady she all stately
dignity despite her hurried breathing at sight of whom these lawless
fellows gave back one and all even Adam himself retreated a step
staring upon her roundeyed Then very slowly he thrust pistols into
belt and uncovering his head bowed full low and I fancied his thin
lips twitched as he did so

So be it my lady says he I call on your ladyship to witness that
I sell two bundles of very unseemly merchandise and he pointed
towards the two helpless forms at his feet And now with your fair
leave madam Ill see these fellows safe aboard and warn my Lord
Dering and gentlemen of your welfare and presence here

Wait says I as he turned to go First I would have these my
purchases set aboard a boat with such stores needful and cast adrift

Why this was not in the bargain Martin says he shaking his head
But it shall be done for sake of our onetime comradeship And away
he goes and his fellows with him True to his word he orders the
pinnace launched and sends divers men to bear these two rogues aboard
Hereupon I cut away their bonds doing the which I found Tressady still
unconscious but Mings for all his wounds seemed lively enough

Master says he staring hard at me Your names Martin as I think

And what then says I mighty short

Tis a name I shall mind as long as I do my own and that is
MingsAbnegation Mings

Aye says I You told me this when you sang of dead men in a wood
at midnight

Ha twas you was it master Well here lieth poor Roger dead or
dying and me little better and tis far to the Main and an ill
journey but should we come there and live there be two men shall
wonder at ye master nor ever forget the name o the man as saved our
necks Howsoever come life or death heres Abnegation doth wish ye a
fair wind ever and always master

So they bore him together with Tressady to the pinnace and setting
them aboard shoved them adrift and I watched Abnegation ply feeble
oars until the boat was through the passage in the reef and out in the
open sea beyond



CHAPTER XLVI

HOW I DOUBTED MYSELF

Now as I stood thus staring out to sea the moon sank and with it my
heart also for as the dark came about me so came darkness within me
and sudden sorrow with great fear of the future wherefore beholding
the loom of the ship where lights twinkled I would gladly have seen
her a shattered wreck and hearing the hoarse laughter and voices of
these lawless fellows waking the echoes of Deliverance Beach I hated
them one and all and to my fear and sorrow anger was added But now
cometh my dear lady to stand beside me to steal her hand into mine
and never a word betwixt us for a while At last

So endeth our solitude Martin

Aye

Our deliverance is come says she and then very softly Doth not
this rejoice you Here answer found I none since now at last I knew
this the very thing I had come most to dread So was silence again
save for these hoarse unlovely voices where they launched and boarded
the longboat Master Adam would have me go on board Martin but tis
near dawn so will I bide with you to welcome this new day

Im glad you stayed Damaris At this I felt her clasp tighten on my
fingers and so she brings me to a rock hard by and sinking on the
warm sand would have me sit by her thus side by side we watched the
boat pull away to the ship and presently all about us was hushed and
still save for the neverceasing murmur of the surge

Martin says she in a while with this new day beginneth for us a
new life In a few short hours we sail for England

England Aye to be sure says I mighty doleful but conscious of
her regard strove to look happy yet made such a botch of it that
getting to her knees she takes my hangdog face betwixt her two hands

O but you are glad she questions a little breathlessly Glad to
come with me to Englandto leave this wilderness

Aye I nodded wellnigh choking on the word

Dear Martin look at me she commanded Now speak me plain Whence
is your grief

O my lady quoth I tis the knowledge of my unworthiness my
unloveliness my rude and graceless ways England is no place for like
of me I am well enough here in the wildto work for you fight for
you an need be but how may I compare with your fine gallants and
courtly gentlemen

Now at this she clasps me all sudden in her arms and setting soft cheek
to mine falls achiding me yet kissing me full oft calling me
silly dear foolish and beloved

How shall you compare cries she Thus and thus dear Martinso
infinitely above and beyond all other men that unless you wed me needs
must I die a maid

Thus did she comfort me soothing my fears and thus the dawn found us

O tis day she sighed Tis day already And now twas her voice
was doleful whiles her eyes gazed regretful round about the white sands
of Deliverance and the treeclad highlands beyond O indeed I do love
this dear island of ours Martin

Sudden upon the stilly air was the beat of oars and we beheld a boat
rowed by a couple of mariners and in the sternsheets Sir Rupert Dering
and the three gentlemen his companions Hereupon my lady would have
me go with her to meet them then and there but I shook my head

Do you go Damaris Ill not speak them before I must And should you
have cause to mention me I pray you will not tell my name

As you will dear Martin says she and pressing my hand goes her
way From the shadow of the rock I watched these gentlemen leap gaily
ashore to bow before her with many and divers elegant posturings
flourishes and flauntings of hats kissing of her hands and the like
gallantries until I must needs scowl otherwhere yet even so was
conscious of their merry laughter where they paced to and fro and the
new risen sun making a glory about her At last she curtseys and
staying them with a gesture comes hasting back to me

Martin says she it seems there be men wounded and dying on board
ship so must I go to them Will you not come with me

Nay I answered Ill to the caves for such things as you would
bring away

Why then my spoon Martin and threelegged stool bring thesenay
wait tis there I would bid farewell to this our dear island Wait me
there Martin

So away she goes on her errand of mercy leaving me to my thoughts and
these all of England and my future life there I was fain to picture
myself married and happy in my ladys love my life thenceforth a
succession of peaceful days amid the ordered quiet of that Kentish
countryside I knew and loved so well With the eye of my mind I seemed
to see a road winding twixt bloomy hedgerows past chattering brooks
and pleasant meadows past sleepy hamlet bowered mid trees and so
neath a leafy shade to where rose tall gates their pillars crowned
by couchant leopards wrought in the stone and beyond these a broad
avenue its green shadow splashed with sunlight leading away to the
house of Conisby Shene with its wide terrace where stood my lady
waiting and expectant yet nowhere could I vision myself And now I
must needs bethink me of Godbys long dark road with the beckoning
light and the waiting arms of love and in my heart the old doubt
waked and a fear that such peace such tender meetings and welcomes
sweet were not for such as I nor ever could be

From these gloomy reflections I was roused by a giggling laugh and
glancing about espied Sir Rupert and his three fellows their finery
somewhat the worse for their late hardship yet themselves very gay and
debonair none the less as they stood viewing me and mighty interested
Presently Sir Rupert steps up to me with his haughtiest
finegentlemanly air and no civility of bowing

Let me perish but heres notable change says he surveying my rich
attire so that I yearned for my rags again Here is strange
metamorphosis The sullen and rustic Cymon bloometh at Beautys
mandate Caliban is tamed At the which sally his companions giggled
again

Sir quoth I and awkwardly enough I am in no mood for your
pleasantries If therefore you have aught else to say of me pray
remove out o my hearing This protest Sir Rupert fanned airily aside
with beringed hand

I gather says he that you have been at some pains of service to my
Lady Brandon in her late dolorous situation herereceive my thanks

I wish none o your thanks sir

None the less I bestow emon my Lady Brandons behalf Furthermore

Enough sir I would be alone

Furthermore he continued and with another airy motion of his white
fingers I would have you particularly remark that if my Lady Brandon
lacking better company hath stooped to any small familiarities with
you these must be forgot and

Ha I cried springing to my feet Begone paltry fool lest I kick
you harder than I did last time at Conisby Shene

Insolent gallowsrogue he panted reaching for his swordhilt but
as he freed it from scabbard I closed with him and wrenching it from
his hold belaboured him soundly with the flat of it and such of his
companions as chanced within my reach until hearing shouts I espied
Adam approaching with divers of his grinning fellows whereupon I
snapped the blade across my knee and hasted from the place

I strode on haphazard in a blind fury but reaching the woods at last
and safe from all observation I cast myself down therein and
gradually my anger grew to a great bitterness For thinks I
gallowsrogue am I in very truth an outcast from my kind a creature
shamed by pillory and lash a poor wretch for spiteful Fortunes
buffets Hereupon being a blind fool ever I cursed the world and all
men in it saving only my unworthy self And next bethinking me of my
dear lady who of her infinite mercy had stooped to love such as I it
seemed that my shame must smirch her also that rather than lifting me
to her level I must needs drag her down to mine She wedding me gave
all whiles I taking all had nought to offer in return save my
unworthiness Verily it seemed that my hopes of life with her in
England were but empty dreams that I had been living in the very
Paradise of Fools unless

Here I raised bowed head and clenching my fists stared blindly before
me

How if the ship should sail without us



CHAPTER XLVII

HOW MY DOUBTING WAS RESOLVED FOR ME

The sun being highrisen and myself famished with hunger I set off for
our habitation by paths wellhid from observation and yearning mightily
to find my lady there Having scaled the cliff I reached the little
plateau and parting the bushes recoiled from the muzzle of a piece
levelled at me by a squat grim fellow

What Godby says I frowning Dye take me for murderer still
then At this he let fall his musket in blank amaze and then came
running and with hands outstretched

O pal cries he O palhave I found ye at last Ha manys the
time Ive grieved for ye and my fools doubts o you Martin choke me
else Im sorry pal burn me but Ive repented my suspecting o you
ever since though to be sure you was mighty strange aboard the
Faithful Friend and small wonder But heres me full o repentance
Martin soif you can forgive poor Godby

Full and freely says I whereupon he hugs me and the tears running
down his sunburned cheeks

Then wem pals again Martin and alls bowmon

And what o me Turning about I beheld Adam on the threshold of the
cave What o me shipmate

Ayewhat says I folding my arms

Ha doth the tap o my pistolbutt smart yet Martin

I know you beyond all doubt for pirate and buccaneer

All past and done Martin

I know you planned from the first to seize the Faithful Friend

Aye but wheres your proofthe Faithful Friend is blown up

And by your hand like as not

True again so it was Martin and thereby did I outwit Tressady and
saved the lives of my own people

You have been at great pains to befool me to your evil ends

At no pains Martin twas purely simple matter

You have been the death of divers men on this island

But always in fair fight says he glancing at me in his furtive
fashion Twas them or me comrade and black rogues all

So you say

And whos to deny it shipmate

Aye who indeed It seems youve killed em all

Ha dye doubt my word Martin

Aye I do so and judging from what I know I do take ye for a very
rogue and so Im done with you henceforth

Rogue says he Tis an ill word And yet I had rather be rogue
than fool and you are the fool of the world Martin for here are you
seeking quarrel with your best friend

Friend quoth I O God protect me from such

Now lookee you have named me rogue and good as called me liar
which is great folly seeing you do lie in my power So here will I
prove my friendship and the depth of your folly

NayIll hear no more

Ayebut you will Cover him Godby and fire if I say so

O Lord love me groaned Godby but obeyed nevertheless and looking
where he stood his piece levelled at me I knew he would obey Adams
word despite his anguished looks

And now says Adam crossing his arms heres the truth ont I
found a poor wretch bent on vengeance murder and a rogues death
which was pure folly I offered you riches the which you refused and
this was arrant folly I took you for comrade brought you aboard ship
with offer of honest employ which you likewise refused and here was
more folly Your conduct on board ship was all folly So despite
yourself I set you on a fair island with the right noble and handsome
lady that you by love might perchance learn some little wisdom
Well you fall in love

Stop cried I clenching my fists

Not I says he uncrossing his arms and I saw he had levelled a
pistol at me in the crook of his arm Im no fine gentleman for ye to
bruise so haul your wind and listen You fall in love with my lady
as how could you help and she with you which is a matter of some
wonder So here are you full o love but doth this teach ye wisdom
Never a whit For now must you fall foul and belabour our four
gallants and from mere fine gentlemen transform em into your deadly
enemies and here was folly stupendous And now you must quarrel with
me the which is folly absolute Thus do I find ye fool persistent and
consistent ever and I being so infinitely the opposite do contemn
you therefore

And now ha you done I demanded raging

Not quite Martin You balked me i the hanging o these two rogues
Tressady and Mings and here was pitiful folly since to hang such were
a wise and prudent measure Thus have you loosed murder on my heels
again well let that go But you doubted my word you named me rogue
and for this you shall fight me So saying he stepped into the cave
and brought thence that same bejewelled Spanish rapier

Ive no mind to fight with you says I turning away

An excellent blade says he making a pass in the air then he
tendered it to me hilt foremost and with the little bow

Tis right you should know I am wearing the chainshirt

No matter quoth he drawing there is your throat or your
eyecome

So point to point we fell to it I had been somewhat esteemed at the
art once and now I matched his vicious thrusts with cunning parades
with volts and passes pushing at him when I might so that twice I was
very near But suddenly as he retreated before my attack his blade
darted and flashed and he called out One And now he pressed me in
turn with quick thrusts and bewildering feints and presently called
out again Two Three Four Then I saw he was cutting the buttons
from my sleeve how and when he would therefore I cast away my sword
in petulant anger and folded my arms

Lord love me Are ye done Martin

O make an end one way or tother Ill not be played with

Verily you were more dangers with the club says he and sheathed
his rapier As for me espying the threelegged stool I sat me down
mighty dejected and full of bitter thoughts until feeling a touch on
my bowed shoulder I looked up and found him beside me

Martin says he tis true you are a fool but your folly harmeth
none but yourself And thourt such honest fool that I must needs love
thee which is strange yet so it is Lookee we have quarrelled and
fought very wellwhats to let us from being friends again

But if I doubt you Adam

Why as to that says he with his whimsical look I verily do think
myself a something doubtful being at times

Now at this up I rose and gripped his hand right heartily which done
he brought me into the cave whiles Godby posted himself on the
threshold leaning on his musket

What now Adam I questioned

Now let us divide our treasure Martin

But I bartered my share for the lives of

Tush says he and reaching a valise from shadowy corner he opened it
and I beheld such a glory of flashing gems as nigh dazzled me with
their splendour Look at em Martin look at em he whispered
Heres love and hate life and death every good and all the
sinslook at em And catching up a handful he let them fall
glittering through his fingers Lord love me Martin he whispered
tis enough to turn a mans brain Have ye counted em over comrade

I never saw them until this moment Adam And I confessed how in my
folly I had cast his letter of instruction into the sea and of how my
lady had found the secret at her dire peril

And she never showed you Martin

I was always too busy

Busy says he sitting back on his heels to stare up at me Busy O
Lord love me Sure theres not your like i the whole world Martin

Which is mighty well for the world says I bitterly

Tis vasty treasure Martin and worth some little risk And in the
cave lie yet fifty and four bars of gold and others of silver with
store of rixdollars doubloons moidores and pieces of eightgold
coins of all countries There let em rotheres more wealth than we
shall ever spend Shall we divide it here or aboard ship

Wait rather until we reach England

So be it comrade Then Im minded to apportion a share to Godby
herewhat dye say

With all my heart

Why then tis time we got it safe on board

But how to do itwhat of Tressadys rogues Adam

Having buried such of themselves as needed it Martin you shall see
em playing leapfrog on the sands down yonder happy as any innocent
schoollads and never a firearm amongst em

Hist Capn says Godby suddenly alert The man Abner and his two
mates apeeping and aprying

Where away Godby man

Hove to in the lee o them bushes yonder

Tis sly skulking rogue Abner says Adam closing and strapping the
valise Tis in my mind Godby this Abner will never live to see
England Summon em hither all three

This Godby did forthwith and presently the three fellows appeared who
knuckling their foreheads made us their several reverences

What now lads says Adam viewing them with his keen eyes I seem
to mind your looks you sailed with Black Bartlemy aboard the Delight
I think Nay tis no matter well let bygones be bygones and we be
all marvellous honest these days the which is well Meantime take
this dunnage down to the boat and he pointed to the valise Hereupon
one of the fellows took it up and knuckled an eyebrow to us in turn
We sail at sundown says Adam so Godby you may as well go aboard
and see that all be ready

Aye aye says Godby tightening the belt where swung his great
cutlass and shouldering his musket set off after the three

So there goeth our fortune aboard comrade

And in desperate risky fashion Adam

In safe straightforward fashion rather and in broad daylight the
which is surer than stealing it aboard in the dark

But should these rogues guess what they carry

They wont Martin and if they should they have but their knives
gainst Godbys musket and pistols

Hamurder Adam

Would you call this murder comrade

What other I wonder what manner of man youll be away there in
England

A worthy right worshipful justice o the peace Martin if Providence
seeth fit in laced coat and great peruke to see that my tenants
cottages be sound and wholesome to pat the touzled heads o the
children bless em And to have word with every soul i the village
To snooze i my great pew o Sundays and dying at last snug abed to
leave behind me a kindly memory And what for you Martin What see
you in the ship yonder

God knoweth says I gloomily

Why not a womans love comrade why not good works rank and
belikechildren to honour your memory

Were I but worthy all this Adam

Zounds but heres humility Yet your true lover is ever humble Ive
heard so tis very well Martin And this doth mind me I bear you a
message from my lady

A messagefrom her I cried gripping his arm Out with it man
out with it and God forgive you this delay What says my lady

This Martin she would have you shave according to late custom

Why so I will But said she no more

Aye something of meeting you here So get to your shaving and
cheerily comrade cheerily Ill to the ship for at sunset tis up
anchor and hey for England Ill fire two guns to warn you aboard and
tarry not for the ship lieth within a sunken reef and we must catch
the flood Here he turned to go then paused to glance round the
horizon with a seamans eye The wind is fair to serve us Martin
says he pinching his chin yet I could wish for a tempest out o the
north and a rising sea

And why Adam in Heavens name

Twould be the sure and certain end of Tressady and Mings comrade
Howbeit whats done is done and all things do lie in the hands of
Providence so do I cherish hope Go and shave Martin go and shave

Left alone I betook me to my razors and shaved me with unwonted care
yet hearkening for her quick light step the while

Scarce was my labour ended that I thought to hear the rustle of leaves
and hasted from the cave calling on her name and mighty joyous and
eager

Damaris Art here at last dear my lady And so came face to face
with Sir Rupert

He stood smiling at my discomfiture yet his black brows were
closebut he halted and folded his arms and I could see the betraying
bulge of the pistol on his great sidepocket For a while he measured
me with his eye at last he spoke

Within the hour my Lady Brandon sails for England and from this hour
you will forget my Lady Brandon ever existed or

Tush man says I Begone you weary me

Or he went on with an airy gesture of his hand I shall cure your
weariness for good

Shoot me

Most joyfully Whatsoever hath chanced betwixt you in this
wilderness my Lady Brandons honour must and

Warned by my look he clapped hand to his pocket but as he freed the
weapon I was upon him grasping his pistolhand For a moment we
swayed together he striving frantically to break my hold I to wrest
the weapon from him then it exploded and uttering a sudden
longdrawn gasp he sank to the grass at my feet and lay very mute and
still Whilst I yet stared from his pallid face to the pistol where it
had fallen I heard shouts a running of feet and glancing up saw the
three gentlemen his companions standing at gaze motionless then
suddenly they turned and hasted away crying murder on me as they
ran Like one in a dream I stared down at Sir Ruperts motionless
form until I was aware of my lady beside him on her knees and of the
pallor of her face as she looked from him to me her eyes wide with
horror

If you have killed him Martinif you have killed him here is an end
of our happinessGod forgive you

Now would I have spoken but found no words for in this moment I knew
that Sir Rupert was surely dead Dumbly I watched the passionate
labour of her dexterous hands saw them pause at last to clasp and
wring themselves in helpless despair saw the three gentlemen obedient
to her word stoop and lift that limp form and bear it slowly away
towards Deliverance Sands and she going beside them

Now as I stood watching her leave me I heard the sudden roar of a gun
and glancing towards the ship saw they were already making sail
Roused by this I came beside my lady and found my voice at last

Here was the work of chancenot I Damaris not I

But she gazing ever on that piteous limp form sought to silence me
with a gesture God Damaris youll never doubt my word
Speakwill you not speak to me He threatened mewe strove together
and the pistol went off in his grasp

Damned Murderer cried one of the gentlemen

After this I held my peace despairing and thus we went in silence
until before us was Deliverance Beach All at once I caught her up in
my arms and despite her struggles began to bear her back up the
ascent For a moment only she strove uttering no word then hiding
her face against me suffered me to bear her where I would But now I
heard shouts and cries that told me I was pursued

You are mine Damaris I cried Mine henceforth and no man shall
take you from me whiles I live

Despite my haste the noise of pursuit waxed louder spurring me to
greater effort And now it became the end and aim of my existence to
reach the cave in time wherefore I began to run on and up until my
breath came in great panting sobs my heart seemed bursting and in my
throbbing brain a confusion of wild thoughts

Better die thus my love upon my heart  The ship shall sail without
us  The door of the cave is stout God be thanked and firing from
the loophole I may withstand them all

Breathless and reeling I gained the plateau at last but as I staggered
towards the cave I tripped and fell heavily crushing her beneath me
But I struggled up and bearing her within the cave laid her upon my
bed and closing the door barred it then I reached my muskets from
their rack and set them in readiness This done and finding my lady so
still and silent I came to view her where she lay and peering in the
dimness uttered a great cry to see the pale oval of cheek horribly
bedabbled with blood Trembling in a sickness of fear I sank beside
her on my knees then seeing she yet breathed I parted the silky hair
above her temple and so came on a cruel gash Now as I strove to
staunch this precious blood I heard again the echoing thunder of a gun

Damaris says I clasping her to me and kissing her pallid lips O
Damaris they are summoning us to England dye hear beloved dye
hear Well they shall call in vainthey shall sail without us Love
hath found us and here with Love will we abide Wake beloved wake
and tell me you would have it so

But save for her breathing and despite all my pleading and caresses
she lay like one dead So I brought water and bathed her face and
throat and wrists yet all to no purpose so that fear grew to agony
How if she die thus thinks I Why then I can die likewise But
again how if she wake and finding the ship gone despise me and in
place of her lover look on me as her gaoler For a long while I
crouched there my head bowed on my fists since well I knew that
England might shelter me nevermore And yet to part with her that was
become my very life

As I knelt thus in an agony of indecision was sudden tumult of
knocking upon the door and the sound of fierce voices

Come forth murderer Open to us rogueopen

But still I knelt there heeding only the hurry of my thoughts

How if the ship sail without us How if she wake and know me for her
gaoler How might I endure loneliness How part with her that was
become my life Belike she might not hate me

Open murderer open roared the voices

A murderer How if she believe this Better loneliness and death
than to read horror of me in her every look

And now beyond the door was silence and then I heard Adam hailing me

Oho shipmateunbar Tides on the turn and we must aboard And
trust me Martin for your comrade as will see justice done ye So
come Martin you and my lady and lets aboard

Aye aye Adam quoth I Better die o solitude than live with a
breaking heart So cheerily it is Adam

Then rising I took my dear lady in my arms and holding her against my
heart I kissed her hair her closed eyes her pale unresponsive lips
and bearing her to the door contrived to open it and stepped forth of
the cave And here I found Adam pistol in hand with divers of his
fellows and the three gentlemen who scowled amain yet eyeing Adams
weapon did no more than clench their fists and mutter of gibbets and
the like

Look you Adam says I my lady is stunned of a fall but twill be
no great matter once we come aboardlet us go

Why then Lord love you Martinhasten says he For tides falling
and its all we shall do to clear the reef

Reaching Deliverance Sands I saw the boat already launched and manned
and wading into the water laid my lady in the stern sheets

Come cried Adam reaching me his hand In with ye man

Not I Adam

Why what now comrade says he staring

Nowmy hand Adam and a prosperous voyage

How comrade will ye stay marooned in this desolation and he
stooped to peer down at me Martin says he gripping my hand and
staring into my eyes Doth this mean you are safer here by reason of
the mystery of Sir Ruperts sudden end

Mayhap says I and loosed his hand What think you

That you are no murderer comrade nor ever will be

My lady said as much once Farewell Adam And I waded back to the
beach

Give way lads cries he Give way I heard the splash and beat of
their oars and when I turned to look I saw them halfway across the
lagoon

Then I turned and wandered aimlessly along these white sands that had
known so often the light tread of her pretty feet Very slowly I went
with eyes that saw not ears that heard not and my mind a confusion of
bitter thoughts

At last I reached the little plateau and from this eminence beheld the
ship standing away under a press of sail and saw that night was at
hand Suddenly as I watched the ship her lofty masts and gleaming
canvas swam all blurred and misty on my sight and sinking to my knees
I bowed my head

Almighty God says I Thou hast shown unto me the wonder of love and
the heaven it might have been but since love is not for me teach me
how I may be avenged

But now even as I prayed thus my voice brake upon a great sob
insomuch that I might pray no more Therefore I cast myself upon my
face forgetting all things but my great and bitter loneliness

And so came night and shut me in

   

Here then I make an end of this narrative of Black Bartlemys Treasure
but how and in what manner I came to my vengeance is yet to tell
