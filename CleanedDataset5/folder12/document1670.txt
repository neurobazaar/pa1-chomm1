mind and all my senses He preserves them as well He gives me clothing
and shoes food and drink house and land wife and children fields
animals and all I own Every day He abundantly provides everything I
need to nourish this body and life He protects me against all danger

hand of God the Almighty Father From there He will come to judge the
living and the dead

What does this mean

I believe that Jesus Christ is truly God born of the Father in
eternity and also truly man born of the Virgin Mary He is my Lord He
redeemed me a lost and condemned person bought and won me from all
sins death and the authority of the Devil It did not cost Him gold or
silver but His holy precious blood His innocent bodyHis death

faith In this Church He generously forgives each day every sin
committed by me and by every believer On the last day He will raise
me and all the dead from the grave He will give eternal life to me and
to all who believe in Christ Yes this is true

III The Our Father
The Simple Way a Father Should Present it to His Household

Introduction

Our Father Who is in Heaven Matthew 69

What does this mean

In this introduction God invites us to believe that He is our real
Father and we are His real children so that we will pray with trust
and complete confidence in the same way beloved children approach
their beloved Father with their requests

The First Request

May Your name be holy Matthew 69

What does this mean

Of course Gods name is holy in and of itself but by this request we
pray that He will make it holy among us too

How does this take place

It happens when Gods Word is taught clearly and purely and when we
live holy lives as Gods children based upon it Help us Heavenly
Father to do this But anyone who teaches and lives by something other
than Gods Word defiles Gods name among us Protect us from this
Heavenly Father

The Second Request

Your Kingdom come Matthew 610

What does this mean

Truly Gods Kingdom comes by itself without our prayer But we pray in
this request that it come to us as well

How does this happen

It happens when the Heavenly Father gives us His Holy Spirit so that
we believe His holy Word by His grace and live godly lives here in this
age and there in eternal life

The Third Request

May Your will be accomplished As it is Heaven so may it be on Earth
Matthew 610

What does this mean

Truly Gods good and gracious will is accomplished without our prayer
But we pray in this request that is accomplished among us as well

How does this happen

It happens when God destroys and interferes with every evil will and
all evil advice which will not allow Gods Kingdom to come such as
the Devils will the worlds will and will of our bodily desires It
also happens when God strengthens us by faith and by His Word and keeps
us living by them faithfully until the end of our lives This is His
will good and full of grace

The Fourth Request

Give us today our daily bread Matthew 611

What does this mean

Truly God gives daily bread to evil people even without our prayer
But we pray in this request that He will help us realize this and
receive our daily bread with thanksgiving

What does Daily bread mean

Everything that nourishes our body and meets its needs such as Food
drink clothing shoes house yard fields cattle money
possessions a devout spouse devout children devout employees devout
and faithful rulers good government good weather peace health
discipline honor good friends faithful neighbors and other things
like these

The Fifth Request

And forgive our guilt as we forgive those guilty of sinning against
us Matthew 612

What does this mean

We pray in this request that our Heavenly Father will neither pay
attention to our sins nor refuse requests such as these because of our
sins and because we are neither worthy nor deserve the things for which
we pray Yet He wants to give them all to us by His grace because many
times each day we sin and truly deserve only punishment Because God
does this we will of course want to forgive from our hearts and
willingly do good to those who sin against us

The Sixth Request

And lead us not into temptation Matthew 612

What does this mean

God tempts no one of course but we pray in this request that God will
protect us and save us so that the Devil the world and our bodily
desires will neither deceive us nor seduce us into heresy despair or
other serious shame or vice and so that we will win and be victorious
in the end even if they attack us

The Seventh Request

But set us free from the Evil One  Matthew 612

What does this mean

We pray in this request as a summary that our Father in Heaven will
save us from every kind of evil that threatens body soul property and
honor We pray that when at last our final hour has come He will grant
us a blessed death and in His grace bring us to Himself from this
valley of tears Amen

What does this mean

That I should be certain that such prayers are acceptable to the Father
in Heaven and will be granted that He Himself has commanded us to pray
in this way and that He promises to answer us Amen Amen This means
Yes yes it will happen this way

IV The Sacrament of Holy Baptism
The Simple Way a Father Should Present it to His Household

What is Baptism

Baptism is not just plain water but it is water contained within Gods
command and united with Gods Word

Where in the Word of God is this

Where our Lord Christ spoke in the last chapter of Matthew Matthew
2819
Go into all the world teaching all heathen nations and baptizing
them in the name of the Father the Son and of the Holy Spirit

What does Baptism give What good is it

It gives us the forgiveness of sins redeems us from death and the
Devil and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this just as
Gods words and promises declare

What are these words and promises of God

Our Lord Christ spoke one of them in the last chapter of Mark Mark
1616
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved but whoever does not
believe will be damned

How can water do such great things

Water doesnt make these things happen of course It is Gods Word
which is with and in the water Because without Gods Word the water
is plain water and not baptism But with Gods Word it is a Baptism a
gracefilled water of life a bath of new birth in the Holy Spirit as
St Paul said to Titus in the third chapter Titus 358
Through this bath of rebirth and renewal of the Holy Spirit which He
poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior that we
justified by the same grace are made heirs according to the hope of
eternal life This is a faithful saying

What is the meaning of such a water Baptism

It means that the old Adam in us should be drowned by daily sorrow and
repentance and die with all sins and evil lusts and in turn a new
person daily come forth and rise from death again He will live forever
before God in righteousness and purity

Where is this written

St Paul says to the Romans in Chapter Six Romans 64
We are buried with Christ through Baptism into death so that in the
same way Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father thus
also must we walk in a new life

V How You Should Teach the Uneducated to Confess

What is confession

Confession has two parts First a person admits his sin Second a
person receives absolution or forgiveness from the confessor as if
from God Himself without doubting it but believing firmly that his
sins are forgiven by God in Heaven through it

Which sins should people confess

When speaking to God we should plead guilty to all sins even those we
dont know about just as we do in the Our Father but when speaking
to the confessor only the sins we know about which we know about and
feel in our hearts

Which are these

Consider here your place in life according to the Ten Commandments Are
you a father A mother A son A daughter A husband A wife A
servant Are you disobedient unfaithful or lazy Have you hurt anyone
with your words or actions Have you stolen neglected your duty let
things go or injured someone

Please suggest to me a simple way to confess

You should speak to your confessor this way

Honorable dear Sir Would you please hear my confession and pronounce
forgiveness according to Gods will

He will respond Yes Please go ahead

Then say
I confess in the presence of God that I am a poor sinner and guilty of
every kind of sin I specifically admit to you that I am a servant
maid etc but Im afraid that I have served my master unfaithfully
From time to time I have not done what I was told to do I have
angered them and caused them to swear at me I have neglected my duty
and allowed damage to be done My words and actions have been shameful
I have been angry with my peers I have complained about my masters
wife and sworn at her etc I am sorry for all of this and ask for
grace I want to do better

A master or a lady of the house should speak this way
I specifically confess to you that I have not faithfully led my
children servants or wife to Gods glory I have cursed I have set a
bad example with my obscene words and actions I have hurt my neighbor
and spoken evil things about him I have charged him too much cheated
him and sold him badly made goods

Let him also confess any other sins against Gods commandments and his
place in life etc

If a person is not burdened with sins such as these or greater sins he
should not look for other sins or invent them because that would turn
confession into torture Instead he should mention one or two that he
knows about For example specifically I confess that I once cursed
Once I used inappropriate language Once I neglected to do this or that
thing etc Let that be enough

If you do not know of anything you have done wrong which does not seem
possible do not say anything in specific but receive forgiveness
based upon the general confession you make to God in the presence of
your confessor

After this the Confessor will say
May God be merciful to you and strengthen your faith

Then he will ask
Do you also believe that the forgiveness I give is Gods forgiveness

Then you will answer
Yes dear sir

After this he will say
May what you believe happen to you And by the command of my Lord
Jesus I forgive your sins in the Name of the Father Son and Holy
Spirit Amen Go in peace The confessor will know how to use
additional passages to comfort and to encourage the faith of those who
sorrow are troubled or whose conscience is greatly burdened This is
only meant to be a general confession for the uneducated

VI The Sacrament of the Altar
The Simple Way a Father Should Present it to his Household

What is the Sacrament of the Altar

It is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ under bread and
wine for us Christians to eat and to drink established by Christ
Himself

Where is that written

The holy apostles Matthew Mark and Luke and St Paul write this
Our Lord Jesus Christ in the night on which He was betrayed took
bread gave thanks broke it gave it to His disciples and said Take
Eat This is My body which is given for you Do this to remember Me
In the same way He also took the cup after supper gave thanks gave it
to them and said Take and drink from it all of you This cup is the
New Testament in my blood which is shed for you to forgive sins This
do as often as you drink it to remember Me

What good does this eating and drinking do

These words tell us Given for you and Shed for you to forgive
sins Namely that the forgiveness of sins life and salvation are
given to us through these words in the sacrament Because where sins
are forgiven there is life and salvation as well

How can physical eating and drinking do such great things

Of course eating and drinking do not do these things These words
written here do them given for you and shed for you to forgive
sins These words along with physical eating and drinking are the
important part of the sacrament Anyone who believes these words has
what they say and what they record namely the forgiveness of sins

Who then receives such a sacrament in a worthy way

Of course fasting and other physical preparations are excellent
disciplines for the body But anyone who believes these words Given
for you and Shed for you to forgive sins is really worthy and well
prepared But whoever doubts or does not believe these words is not
worthy and is unprepared because the words for you demand a heart
that fully believes

Appendix I
How a Father Should Teach His Household
to Conduct Morning and Evening Devotions

Morning Devotions

As soon as you get out of bed in the morning you should bless yourself
with the sign of the Holy Cross and say

May the will of God the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit be done
Amen
Then kneeling or standing say the creed and pray the Lords Prayer
If you wish you may then pray this little prayer as well
My Heavenly Father I thank You through Jesus Christ Your beloved
Son that You kept me safe from all evil and danger last night Save
me I pray that you will keep me safe today from every evil and sin as
well so that all I do and the way that I live will please you I put
myself in your care body and soul and all that I have Let Your holy
Angels be with me so that the evil enemy will not gain power over me
Amen
After that with joy go about your work and perhaps sing a song
inspired by the Ten Commandments or your own thoughts

Evening Devotions

When you go to bed in the evening you should bless yourself with the
sign of the Holy Cross and say
May the will of God the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit be done
Amen
Then kneeling or standing say the creed and pray the Lords Prayer
If you wish then you may pray this little prayer as well
My Heavenly Father I thank You through Jesus Christ Your beloved
Son that You have protected me by Your grace Forgive I pray all my
sins and the evil I have done Protect me by Your grace tonight I
put myself in your care body and soul and all that I have Let Your
holy angels be with me so that the evil enemy will not gain power over
me Amen

After this go to sleep immediately with joy

Appendix II
How a Father Should Teach His Household
to say Grace and Return Thanks at Meals

The Blessing

The children and servants should come to the table modestly and with
folded hands and say
All eyes look to you O Lord and You give everyone food at the right
time You open Your generous hands and satisfy the hunger of all living
things with what they desire Psalm 1451516
Note What they desire means that all animals get so much to eat
that they are happy and cheerful Because worry and greed interferes
with such desires
After this pray the Lords Prayer and the following prayer
Lord God Heavenly Father bless us and these gifts which we receive
from Your generous hand through Jesus Christ our Lord Amen

Thanking God

After eating too they should modestly fold their hands and say

Thank the Lord because He is kind and His goodness lasts forever He
gives all creatures food He gives livestock their food and feeds the
young ravens that call out to Him A horses strength does not give Him
pleasure A mans legs do not give Him joy People who fear the Lord
and who wait for His goodness please Him

After this pray the Lords Prayer and the following prayer
We thank You Lord God Father through Jesus Christ our Lord for all
Your blessings You live and rule forever Amen

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
