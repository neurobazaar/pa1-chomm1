Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

Project Gutenbergs Etext of Shakespeares The first Part of
Henry the Sixt




Executive Directors Notes

In addition to the notes below and so you will NOT think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected here are the first few lines of Hamlet as they
are presented herein

 Barnardo Whos there
 Fran Nay answer me Stand  vnfold
your selfe

 Bar Long liue the King



As I understand it the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a cliche  this is the
original meaning of the term cliche  and thus being unwilling
to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd  such as the exchanges of u for v v for u
above  and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner   

The answer is that they MAY have packed liue into a cliche at a
time when they were out of vs  possibly having used vv in
place of some ws etc This was a common practice of the day
as print was still quite expensive and they didnt want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to

You will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as I
have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an
extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a
very high place in the canon of Shakespeare My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
  in great detail  and determined from the various changes
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for even though he was infamous
for signing his name with several different spellings

So please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file you may see errors
that are not errors   

So  with this caveat  we have NOT changed the canon errors
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeares The first
Part of Henry the Sixt

Scanners Notes What this is and isnt This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeares first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text

The elongated Ss have been changed to small ss and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae I have left the spelling
punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text I have corrected some spelling mistakes I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeares First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template typos and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them Everything within
brackets  is what I have added So if you dont like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare

Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio So there may
be differences other than what I have mentioned above between
this and other first folio editions This is due to the printers
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run The proof run wasnt thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies This is just the way it is
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions best pages

If you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation
errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors I wish to make this the best
etext possible My email address for right now are haraddaaolcom
and davidrinconnectcom I hope that you enjoy this

The Winters Tale

Actus Primus Scoena Prima

Enter Camillo and Archidamus

 Arch If you shall chance Camillo to visit Bohemia on
the like occasion whereon my seruices are now
onfoot you shall see as I haue said great difference
betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia

 Cam I thinke this comming Summer the King of
Sicilia meanes to pay Bohemia the Visitation which hee
iustly owes him

 Arch Wherein our Entertainment shall shame vs we
will be iustified in our Loues for indeed
 Cam Beseech you
 Arch Verely I speake it in the freedome of my knowledge
we cannot with such magnificence in so rare
I know not what to say Wee will giue you sleepie
Drinkes that your Sences vnintelligent of our insufficience
may though they cannot prayse vs as little accuse
vs

 Cam You pay a great deale to deare for whats giuen
freely

 Arch Beleeue me I speake as my vnderstanding instructs
me and as mine honestie puts it to vtterance

 Cam Sicilia cannot shew himselfe ouerkind to Bohemia
They were traynd together in their Childhoods
and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection
which cannot chuse but braunch now Since their more
mature Dignities and Royall Necessities made seperation
of their Societie their Encounters though not Personall
hath been Royally attornyed with enterchange of
Gifts Letters louing Embassies that they haue seemd to
be together though absent shooke hands as ouer a Vast
and embracd as it were from the ends of opposed Winds
The Heauens continue their Loues

 Arch I thinke there is not in the World either Malice
or Matter to alter it You haue an vnspeakable comfort
of your young Prince Mamillius it is a Gentleman of the
greatest Promise that euer came into my Note

 Cam I very well agree with you in the hopes of him
it is a gallant Child one that indeed Physicks the Subiect
makes old hearts fresh they that went on Crutches
ere he was borne desire yet their life to see him a Man

 Arch Would they else be content to die
 Cam Yes if there were no other excuse why they should
desire to liue

 Arch If the King had no Sonne they would desire to
liue on Crutches till he had one

There is no Tongue that moues none none ith World
So soone as yours could win me so it should now
Were there necessitie in your request although
Twere needfull I denyd it My Affaires
Doe euen drag me homeward which to hinder
Were in your Loue a Whip to me my stay
To you a Charge and Trouble to saue both
Farewell our Brother
 Leo Tonguetyd our Queene speake you

 Her I had thought Sir to haue held my peace vntill
You had drawne Oathes from him not to stay you Sir
Charge him too coldly Tell him you are sure
All in Bohemias well this satisfaction
The bygoneday proclaymd say this to him
Hes beat from his best ward

 Leo Well said Hermione

 Her To tell he longs to see his Sonne were strong
But let him say so then and let him goe
But let him sweare so and he shall not stay
Weel thwack him hence with Distaffes
Yet of your Royall presence Ile aduenture
The borrow of a Weeke When at Bohemia
You take my Lord Ile giue him my Commission
To let him there a Moneth behind the Gest
Prefixd fors parting yet gooddeed Leontes

What Lady she her Lord Youle stay
 Pol No Madame

You put me off with limber Vowes but I
Though you would seek t vnsphere the Stars with Oaths
Should yet say Sir no going Verely
You shall not goe a Ladyes Verely is
As potent as a Lords Will you goe yet
Force me to keepe you as a Prisoner
Not like a Guest so you shall pay your Fees
When you depart and saue your Thanks How say you
My Prisoner or my Guest by your dread Verely
One of them you shall be

 Pol Your Guest then Madame
To be your Prisoner should import offending
Which is for me lesse easie to commit
Then you to punish

 Her Not your Gaoler then
But your kind Hostesse Come Ile question you
Of my Lords Tricks and yours when you were Boyes
You were pretty Lordings then
 Pol We were faire Queene
Two Lads that thought there was no more behind
But such a day to morrow as to day
And to be Boy eternall

 Her Was not my Lord
The veryer Wag oth two
 Pol We were as twynd Lambs that did frisk ith Sun
And bleat the one at th other what we changd
Was Innocence for Innocence we knew not
The Doctrine of illdoing nor dreamd
That any did Had we pursud that life
And our weake Spirits nere been higher reard
With stronger blood we should haue answerd Heauen
Boldly not guilty the Imposition cleard
Hereditarie ours

 Her By this we gather
You haue tript since

 Pol O my most sacred Lady
Temptations haue since then been borne tos for
In those vnfledgd dayes was my Wife a Girle
Your precious selfe had then not crossd the eyes
Of my young Playfellow

 Her Grace to boot
Of this make no conclusion least you say
Your Queene and I are Deuils yet goe on
Th offences we haue made you doe weele answere
If you first sinnd with vs and that with vs
You did continue fault and that you slipt not
With any but with vs

 Leo Is he woon yet
 Her Heele stay my Lord
 Leo At my request he would not
Hermione my dearest thou neuer spoakst
To better purpose

 Her Neuer
 Leo Neuer but once

 Her What haue I twice said well when wast before
I prethee tell me crams with prayse and makes
As fat as tame things One good deed dying tonguelesse
Slaughters a thousand wayting vpon that
Our prayses are our Wages You may rides
With one soft Kisse a thousand Furlongs ere
With Spur we heat an Acre But to th Goale
My last good deed was to entreat his stay
What was my first it has an elder Sister
Or I mistake you O would her Name were Grace
But once before I spoke to th purpose when
Nay let me hauet I long

 Leo Why that was when
Three crabbed Moneths had sowrd themselues to death
Ere I could make thee open thy white Hand
A clap thy selfe my Loue then didst thou vtter
I am yours for euer

 Her Tis Grace indeed
Why loyou now I haue spoke to th purpose twice
The one for euer earnd a Royall Husband
Th other for some while a Friend

 Leo Too hot too hot
To mingle friendship farre is mingling bloods
I haue Tremor Cordis on me my heart daunces
But not for ioy not ioy This Entertainment
May a free face put on deriue a Libertie
From Heartinesse from Bountie fertile Bosome
And well become the Agent t may I graunt
But to be padling Palmes and pinching Fingers
As now they are and making practisd Smiles
As in a LookingGlasse and then to sigh as twere
The Mort oth Deere oh that is entertainment
My Bosome likes not nor my Browes Mamillius
Art thou my Boy
 Mam I my good Lord

 Leo Ifecks
Why thats my Bawcock what hast smutchd thy Nose
They say it is a Coppy out of mine Come Captaine
We must be neat not neat but cleanly Captaine
And yet the Steere the Heycfer and the Calfe
Are all calld Neat Still Virginalling
Vpon his Palme How now you wanton Calfe
Art thou my Calfe
 Mam Yes if you will my Lord
 Leo Thou wantst a rough pash  the shoots that I haue
To be full like me yet they say we are
Almost as like as Egges Women say so
That will say any thing But were they false
As oredyd Blacks as Wind as Waters false
As Dice are to be wishd by one that fixes
No borne twixt his and mine yet were it true
To say this Boy were like me Come Sir Page
Looke on me with your Welkin eye sweet Villaine
Most dearst my Collop Can thy Dam mayt be
Affection thy Intention stabs the Center
Thou dost make possible things not so held
Communicatst with Dreames how can this be
With whats vnreall thou coactiue art
And fellowst nothing Then tis very credent
Thou mayst coioyne with something and thou dost
And that beyond Commission and I find it
And that to the infection of my Braines
And hardning of my Browes
 Pol What meanes Sicilia
 Her He something seemes vnsetled

 Pol How my Lord
 Leo What cheere how ist with you best Brother
 Her You look as if you held a Brow of much distraction
Are you moud my Lord
 Leo No in good earnest
How sometimes Nature will betray its folly
Its tendernesse and make it selfe a Pastime
To harder bosomes Looking on the Lynes
Of my Boyes face me thoughts I did requoyle
Twentie three yeeres and saw my selfe vnbreechd
In my greene Veluet Coat my Dagger muzzeld
Least it should bite its Master and so proue
As Ornaments oft dos too dangerous
How like me thought I then was to this Kernell
This Squash this Gentleman Mine honest Friend
Will you take Egges for Money
 Mam No my Lord Ile fight

 Leo You will why happy man bes dole My Brother
Are you so fond of your young Prince as we
Doe seeme to be of ours
 Pol If at home Sir
Hes all my Exercise my Mirth my Matter
Now my sworne Friend and then mine Enemy
My Parasite my Souldier Statesman all
He makes a Iulyes day short as December
And with his varying childnesse cures in me
Thoughts that would thick my blood

 Leo So stands this Squire
Officd with me We two will walke my Lord
And leaue you to your grauer steps Hermione
How thou loust vs shew in our Brothers welcome
Let what is deare in Sicily be cheape
Next to thy selfe and my young Rouer hes
Apparant to my heart

 Her If you would seeke vs
We are yours ith Garden shalls attend you there
 Leo To your owne bents dispose you youle be found
Be you beneath the Sky I am angling now
Though you perceiue me not how I giue Lyne
Goe too goe too
How she holds vp the Neb the Byll to him
And armes her with the boldnesse of a Wife
To her allowing Husband Gone already
Ynchthick kneedeepe ore head and eares a forkd one
Goe play Boy play thy Mother playes and I
Play too but so disgracd a part whose issue
Will hisse me to my Graue Contempt and Clamor
Will be my Knell Goe play Boy play there haue been
Or I am much deceiud Cuckolds ere now
And many a man there is euen at this present
Now while I speake this holds his Wife by th Arme
That little thinkes she has been sluycd ins absence
And his Pond fishd by his next Neighbor by
Sir Smile his Neighbor nay theres comfort int
Whiles other men haue Gates and those Gates opend
As mine against their will Should all despaire
That haue reuolted Wiues the tenth of Mankind
Would hang themselues Physick fort theres none
It is a bawdy Planet that will strike
Where tis predominant and tis powrefull thinke it
From East West North and South be it concluded
No Barricado for a Belly Knowt
It will let in and out the Enemy
With bag and baggage many thousand ons
Haue the Disease and feelet not How now Boy
 Mam I am like you say

 Leo Why thats some comfort
What Camillo there
 Cam I my good Lord

 Leo Goe play Mamillius thourt an honest man
Camillo this great Sir will yet stay longer

 Cam You had much adoe to make his Anchor hold
When you cast out it still came home

 Leo Didst note it
 Cam He would not stay at your Petitions made
His Businesse more materiall

 Leo Didst perceiue it
Theyre here with me already whispring rounding
Sicilia is a soforth tis farre gone
When I shall gust it last How camt Camillo
That he did stay
 Cam At the good Queenes entreatie

 Leo At the Queenes bet Good should be pertinent
But so it is it is not Was this taken
By any vnderstanding Pate but thine
For thy Conceit is soaking will draw in
More then the common Blocks Not noted ist
But of the finer Natures by some Seueralls
Of Headpeece extraordinarie Lower Messes
Perchance are to this Businesse purblind say

 Cam Businesse my Lord I thinke most vnderstand
Bohemia stayes here longer

 Leo Ha
 Cam Stayes here longer

 Leo I but why
 Cam To satisfie your Highnesse and the Entreaties
Of our most gracious Mistresse

 Leo Satisfie
Th entreaties of your Mistresse Satisfie
Let that suffice I haue trusted thee Camillo
With all the neerest things to my heart as well
My ChamberCouncels wherein Priestlike thou
Hast cleansd my Bosome I from thee departed
Thy Penitent reformd but we haue been
Deceiud in thy Integritie deceiud
In that which seemes so

 Cam Be it forbid my Lord
 Leo To bide vpont thou art not honest or
If thou inclinst that way thou art a Coward
Which hoxes honestie behind restrayning
From Course requird or else thou must be counted
A Seruant grafted in my serious Trust
And therein negligent or else a Foole
That seest a Game playd home the rich Stake drawne
And takst it all for ieast

 Cam My gracious Lord
I may be negligent foolish and fearefull
In euery one of these no man is free
But that his negligence his folly feare
Among the infinite doings of the World
Sometime puts forth in your affaires my Lord
If euer I were wilfullnegligent
It was my folly if industriously
I playd the Foole it was my negligence
Not weighing well the end if euer fearefull
To doe a thing where I the issue doubted
Whereof the execution did cry out
Against the nonperformance twas a feare
Which oft infects the wisest these my Lord
Are such allowd Infirmities that honestie
Is neuer free of But beseech your Grace
Be plainer with me let me know my Trespas
By its owne visage if I then deny it
Tis none of mine

 Leo Ha not you seene Camillo
But thats past doubt you haue or your eyeglasse
Is thicker then a Cuckolds Horne or heard
For to a Vision so apparant Rumor
Cannot be mute or thought for Cogitation
Resides not in that man that dos not thinke
My Wife is slipperie If thou wilt confesse
Or else be impudently negatiue
To haue nor Eyes nor Eares nor Thought then say
My Wifes a HolyHorse deserues a Name
As ranke as any FlaxWench that puts to
Before her trothplight sayt and iustifyt

 Cam I would not be a standerby to heare
My Soueraigne Mistresse clouded so without
My present vengeance taken shrew my heart
You neuer spoke what did become you lesse
Then this which to reiterate were sin
As deepe as that though true

 Leo Is whispering nothing
Is leaning Cheeke to Cheeke is meating Noses
Kissing with inside Lip stopping the Cariere
Of Laughter with a sigh a Note infallible
Of breaking Honestie horsing foot on foot
Skulking in corners wishing Clocks more swift
Houres Minutes Noone Midnight and all Eyes
Blind with the Pin and Web but theirs theirs onely
That would vnseene be wicked Is this nothing
Why then the World and all thats int is nothing
The couering Skie is nothing Bohemia nothing
My Wife is nothing nor Nothing haue these Nothings
If this be nothing

 Cam Good my Lord be curd
Of this diseasd Opinion and betimes
For tis most dangerous

 Leo Say it be tis true

 Cam No no my Lord

 Leo It is you lye you lye
I say thou lyest Camillo and I hate thee
Pronounce thee a grosse Lowt a mindlesse Slaue
Or else a houering Temporizer that
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and euill
Inclining to them both were my Wiues Liuer
Infected as her life she would not liue
The running of one Glasse

 Cam Who dos infect her
 Leo Why he that weares her like her Medull hanging
About his neck Bohemia who if I
Had Seruants true about me that bare eyes
To see alike mine Honor as their Profits
Their owne particular Thrifts they would doe that
Which should vndoe more doing I and thou
His Cupbearer whom I from meaner forme
Haue Benchd and reard to Worship who mayst see
Plainely as Heauen sees Earth and Earth sees Heauen
How I am galld mightst bespice a Cup
To giue mine Enemy a lasting Winke
Which Draught to me were cordiall

 Cam Sir my Lord
I could doe this and that with no rash Potion
But with a lingring Dram that should not worke
Maliciously like Poyson But I cannot
Beleeue this Crack to be in my dread Mistresse
So soueraignely being Honorable
I haue loud thee
 Leo Make that thy question and goe rot
Dost thinke I am so muddy so vnsetled
To appoint my selfe in this vexation
Sully the puritie and whitenesse of my Sheetes
Which to preserue is Sleepe which being spotted
Is Goades Thornes Nettles Tayles of Waspes
Giue scandall to the blood oth Prince my Sonne
Who I doe thinke is mine and loue as mine
Without ripe mouing tot Would I doe this
Could man so blench
 Cam I must beleeue you Sir
I doe and will fetch off Bohemia fort
Prouided that when hees remoud your Highnesse

Knowne and allyd to yours

 Leo Thou dost aduise me
Euen so as I mine owne course haue set downe
Ile giue no blemish to her Honor none

 Cam My Lord

As Friendship weares at Feasts keepe with Bohemia
And with your Queene I am his Cupbearer
If from me he haue wholesome Beueridge

 Leo This is all
Dot and thou hast the one halfe of my heart
Dot not thou splittst thine owne

 Cam Ile dot my Lord

 Leo I wil seeme friendly as thou hast aduisd me

Exit

 Cam O miserable Lady But for me
What case stand I in I must be the poysoner
Of good Polixenes and my ground to dot
Is the obedience to a Master one
Who in Rebellion with himselfe will haue
All that are his so too To doe this deed
Promotion followes If I could find example
Of thousands that had struck anoynted Kings
And flourishd after Ild not dot But since
Nor Brasse nor Stone nor Parchment beares not one
Let Villanie it selfe forsweart I must
Forsake the Court to dot or no is certaine
To me a breakeneck Happy Starre raigne now
Here comes Bohemia
Enter Polixenes

 Pol This is strange Me thinkes
My fauor here begins to warpe Not speake
Good day Camillo

 Cam Hayle most Royall Sir

 Pol What is the Newes ith Court
 Cam None rare my Lord
 Pol The King hath on him such a countenance
As he had lost some Prouince and a Region
Loud as he loues himselfe euen now I met him
With customarie complement when hee
Wafting his eyes to th contrary and falling
A Lippe of much contempt speedes from me and
So leaues me to consider what is breeding
That changes thus his Manners

 Cam I dare not know my Lord
 Pol How dare not doe not doe you know and dare not
Be intelligent to me tis thereabouts
For to your selfe what you doe know you must
And cannot say you dare not Good Camillo
Your changd complexions are to me a Mirror
Which shewes me mine changd too for I must be
A partie in this alteration finding
My selfe thus alterd witht

 Cam There is a sicknesse
Which puts some of vs in distemper but
I cannot name the Disease and it is caught
Of you that yet are well

 Pol How caught of me
Make me not sighted like the Basilisque
I haue lookd on thousands who haue sped the better
By my regard but killd none so Camillo
As you are certainely a Gentleman thereto
Clerkelike experiencd which no lesse adornes
Our Gentry then our Parents Noble Names
In whose successe we are gentle I beseech you
If you know ought which dos behoue my knowledge
Thereof to be informd imprisont not
In ignorant concealement

 Cam I may not answere

 Pol A Sicknesse caught of me and yet I well
I must be answerd Dost thou heare Camillo
I coniure thee by all the parts of man
Which Honor dos acknowledge whereof the least
Is not this Suit of mine that thou declare
What incidencie thou dost ghesse of harme
Is creeping toward me how farre off how neere
Which way to be preuented if to be
If not how best to beare it

 Cam Sir I will tell you
Since I am chargd in Honor and by him
That I thinke Honorable therefore marke my counsaile
Which must be eun as swiftly followed as
I meane to vtter it or both your selfe and me
Cry lost and so good night

 Pol On good Camillo

 Cam I am appointed him to murther you

 Pol By whom Camillo
 Cam By the King

 Pol For what
 Cam He thinkes nay with all confidence he sweares
As he had seent or beene an Instrument
To vice you tot that you haue toucht his Queene
Forbiddenly

 Pol Oh then my best blood turne
To an infected Gelly and my Name
Be yoakd with his that did betray the Best
Turne then my freshest Reputation to
A sauour that may strike the dullest Nosthrill
Where I arriue and my approch be shund
Nay hated too worse then the greatst Infection
That ere was heard or read

 Cam Sweare his thought ouer
By each particular Starre in Heauen and
By all their Influences you may as well
Forbid the Sea for to obey the Moone
As or by Oath remoue or Counsaile shake
The Fabrick of his Folly whose foundation
Is pyld vpon his Faith and will continue
The standing of his Body

 Pol How should this grow
 Cam I know not but I am sure tis safer to
Auoid whats growne then question how tis borne
If therefore you dare trust my honestie
That lyes enclosed in this Trunke which you
Shall beare along impawnd away to Night
Your Followers I will whisper to the Businesse
And will by twoes and threes at seuerall Posternes
Cleare them oth Citie For my selfe Ile put
My fortunes to your seruice which are here
By this discouerie lost Be not vncertaine
For by the honor of my Parents I
Haue vttred Truth which if you seeke to proue
I dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
Then one condemnd by the Kings owne mouth
Thereon his Execution sworne

 Pol I doe beleeue thee
I saw his heart ins face Giue me thy hand
Be Pilot to me and thy places shall
Still neighbour mine My Ships are ready and
My people did expect my hence departure
Two dayes agoe This Iealousie
Is for a precious Creature as shees rare
Must it be great and as his Persons mightie
Must it be violent and as he dos conceiue
He is dishonord by a man which euer
Professd to him why his Reuenges must
In that be made more bitter Feare oreshades me
Good Expedition be my friend and comfort
The gracious Queene part of his Theame but nothing
Of his illtane suspition Come Camillo
I will respect thee as a Father if
Thou bearst my life off hence Let vs auoid

 Cam It is in mine authoritie to command
The Keyes of all the Posternes Please your Highnesse
To take the vrgent houre Come Sir away

 Her Come on then and giut me in mine eare

 Leon Was hee met there his Traine Camillo with
him
 Lord Behind the tuft of Pines I met them neuer
Saw I men scowre so on their way I eyed them
Euen to their Ships

 Leo How blest am I
In my iust Censure in my true Opinion
Alack for lesser knowledge how accursd
In being so blest There may be in the Cup
A Spider steepd and one may drinke depart
And yet partake no venome for his knowledge
Is not infected but if one present
Th abhord Ingredient to his eye make knowne
How he hath drunke he cracks his gorge his sides
With violent Hefts I haue drunke and seene the Spider
Camillo was his helpe in this his Pandar
There is a Plot against my Life my Crowne
Alls true that is mistrusted that false Villaine
Whom I employd was preemployd by him
He has discouerd my Designe and I
Remaine a pinchd Thing yea a very Trick
For them to play at will how came the Posternes
So easily open
 Lord By his great authority
Which often hath no lesse preuaild then so
On your command

 Leo I knowt too well
Giue me the Boy I am glad you did not nurse him
Though he dos beare some signes of me yet you
Haue too much blood in him

 Her What is this Sport
 Leo Beare the Boy hence he shall not come about her
Away with him and let her sport her selfe
With that shees bigwith for tis Polixenes
Has made thee swell thus

 Her But Ild say he had not
And Ile be sworne you would beleeue my saying
How ere you leane to th Nayward

 Leo You my Lords
Looke on her marke her well be but about
To say she is a goodly Lady and
The iustice of your hearts will thereto adde
Tis pitty shees not honest Honorable
Prayse her but for this her withoutdoreForme
Which on my faith deserues high speech and straight
The Shrug the Hum or Ha these Pettybrands
That Calumnie doth vse Oh I am out
That Mercy dos for Calumnie will seare
Vertue it selfe these Shrugs these Hums and Has
When you haue said shees goodly come betweene
Ere you can say shees honest But bet knowne
From him that has most cause to grieue it should be
Shees an Adultresse

 Her Should a Villaine say so
The most replenishd Villaine in the World
He were as much more Villaine you my Lord
Doe but mistake

 Leo You haue mistooke my Lady
Polixenes for Leontes O thou Thing
Which Ile not call a Creature of thy place
Least Barbarisme making me the precedent
Should a like Language vse to all degrees
And mannerly distinguishment leaue out
Betwixt the Prince and Begger I haue said
Shees an Adultresse I haue said with whom
More shees a Traytor and Camillo is
A Federarie with her and one that knowes
What she should shame to know her selfe
But with her most vild Principall that shees
A Bedswaruer euen as bad as those
That Vulgars giue boldst Titles I and priuy
To this their late escape

 Her No by my life
Priuy to none of this how will this grieue you
When you shall come to clearer knowledge that
You thus haue publishd me Gentle my Lord
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
You did mistake

 Leo No if I mistake
In those Foundations which I build vpon
The Centre is not bigge enough to beare
A SchooleBoyes Top Away with her to Prison
He who shall speake for her is a farreoff guiltie
But that he speakes

 Her Theres some ill Planet raignes
I must be patient till the Heauens looke
With an aspect more fauorable Good my Lords
I am not prone to weeping as our Sex
Commonly are the want of which vaine dew
Perchance shall dry your pitties but I haue
That honorable Griefe lodgd here which burnes
Worse then Teares drowne beseech you all my Lords
With thoughts so qualified as your Charities
Shall best instruct you measure me and so
The Kings will be performd

 Leo Shall I be heard
 Her Who ist that goes with me beseech your Highnes
My Women may be with me for you see
My plight requires it Doe not weepe good Fooles
There is no cause When you shall know your Mistris
Has deserud Prison then abound in Teares
As I come out this Action I now goe on
Is for my better grace Adieu my Lord
I neuer wishd to see you sorry now
I trust I shall my Women come you haue leaue

 Leo Goe doe our bidding hence

 Lord Beseech your Highnesse call the Queene againe

 Antig Be certaine what you do Sir least your Iustice
Proue violence in the which three great ones suffer
Your Selfe your Queene your Sonne

 Lord For her my Lord
I dare my life lay downe and will dot Sir
Please you t accept it that the Queene is spotlesse
Ith eyes of Heauen and to you I meane
In this which you accuse her
 Antig If it proue
Shees otherwise Ile keepe my Stables where
I lodge my Wife Ile goe in couples with her
Then when I feele and see her no farther trust her
For euery ynch of Woman in the World
I euery dram of Womans flesh is false
If she be

 Leo Hold your peaces

 Lord Good my Lord

 Antig It is for you we speake not for our selues
You are abusd and by some putter on
That will be damnd fort would I knew the Villaine
I would Landdamne him be she honorflawd
I haue three daughters the eldest is eleuen
The second and the third nine and some fiue
If this proue true theyl pay fort By mine Honor
Ile gelld em all fourteene they shall not see
To bring false generations they are coheyres
And I had rather glib my selfe then they
Should not produce faire issue

 Leo Cease no more
You smell this businesse with a sence as cold
As is a deadmans nose but I do seet and feelt
As you feele doing thus and see withall
The Instruments that feele

 Antig If it be so
We neede no graue to burie honesty
Theres not a graine of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole dungyearth

 Leo What lacke I credit
 Lord I had rather you did lacke then I my Lord
Vpon this ground and more it would content me
To haue her Honor true then your suspition
Be blamd fort how you might

 Leo Why what neede we
Commune with you of this but rather follow
Our forcefull instigation Our prerogatiue
Cals not your Counsailes but our naturall goodnesse
Imparts this which if you or stupified
Or seeming so in skill cannot or will not
Rellish a truth like vs informe your selues
We neede no more of your aduice the matter
The losse the gaine the ordring ont
Is all properly ours

 Antig And I wish my Liege
You had onely in your silent iudgement tride it
Without more ouerture

 Leo How could that be
Either thou art most ignorant by age
Or thou wert borne a foole Camillos flight
Added to their Familiarity
Which was as grosse as euer touchd coniecture
That lackd sight onely nought for approbation
But onely seeing all other circumstances
Made vp toth deed doth pushon this proceeding
Yet for a greater confirmation
For in an Acte of this importance twere
Most pitteous to be wilde I haue dispatchd in post
To sacred Delphos to Appollos Temple
Cleomines and Dion whom you know
Of stuffdsufficiency Now from the Oracle
They will bring all whose spirituall counsaile had
Shall stop or spurre me Haue I done well
 Lord Well done my Lord
 Leo Though I am satisfide and neede no more
Then what I know yet shall the Oracle
Giue rest to th mindes of others such as he
Whose ignorant credulitie will not
Come vp to th truth So haue we thought it good
From our free person she should be confinde
Least that the treachery of the two fled hence
Be left her to performe Come follow vs
We are to speake in publique for this businesse
Will raise vs all

 Antig To laughter as I take it
If the good truth were knowne

He cannot be compelld toot once remoue
The Root of his Opinion which is rotten
As euer Oake or Stone was sound

To some remote and desart place quite out
Of our Dominions and that there thou leaue it
Without more mercy to it owne protection
And fauour of the Climate as by strange fortune
It came to vs I doe in Iustice charge thee
On thy Soules perill and thy Bodyes torture
That thou commend it strangely to some place
Where Chance may nurse or end it take it vp

 Antig I sweare to doe this though a present death
Had beene more mercifull Come on poore Babe
Some powerfull Spirit instruct the Kytes and Rauens
To be thy Nurses Wolues and Beares they say

and conspiring with Camillo to take away the Life of our
Soueraigne
Lord the King thy Royall Husband the pretence whereof
being by circumstances partly layd open thou Hermione contrary
to the Faith and Allegeance of a true Subiect didst counsaile
and ayde them for their better safetie to flye away by
Night

 Her Since what I am to say must be but that
Which contradicts my Accusation and
The testimonie on my part no other
But what comes from my selfe it shall scarce boot me
To say Not guiltie mine Integritie
Being counted Falsehood shall as I expresse it
Be so receiud But thus if Powres Diuine
Behold our humane Actions as they doe
I doubt not then but Innocence shall make
False Accusation blush and Tyrannie
Tremble at Patience You my Lord best know
Whom least will seeme to doe so my past life
Hath beene as continent as chaste as true
As I am now vnhappy which is more
Then Historie can patterne though deuisd
And playd to take Spectators For behold me
A Fellow of the Royall Bed which owe
A Moitie of the Throne a great Kings Daughter
The Mother to a hopefull Prince here standing
To prate and talke for Life and Honor fore
Who please to come and heare For Life I prize it
As I weigh Griefe which I would spare For Honor
Tis a deriuatiue from me to mine
And onely that I stand for I appeale
To your owne Conscience Sir before Polixenes
Came to your Court how I was in your grace
How merited to be so Since he came
With what encounter so vncurrant I
Haue straynd t appeare thus if one iot beyond
The bound of Honor or in act or will
That way enclining hardned be the hearts
Of all that heare me and my neerst of Kin
Cry fie vpon my Graue

 Leo I nere heard yet
That any of these bolder Vices wanted
Lesse Impudence to gainesay what they did
Then to performe it first

 Her Thats true enough
Though tis a saying Sir not due to me

 Leo You will not owne it

 Her More then Mistresse of
Which comes to me in name of Fault I must not
At all acknowledge For Polixenes
With whom I am accusd I doe confesse
I loud him as in Honor he requird
With such a kind of Loue as might become
A Lady like me with a Loue euen such
So and no other as your selfe commanded
Which not to haue done I thinke had been in me
Both Disobedience and Ingratitude
To you and toward your Friend whose Loue had spoke
Euen since it could speake from an Infant freely
That it was yours Now for Conspiracie
I know not how it tastes though it be dishd
For me to try how All I know of it
Is that Camillo was an honest man
And why he left your Court the Gods themselues
Wotting no more then I are ignorant

 Leo You knew of his departure as you know
What you haue vndertane to doe ins absence

 Her Sir
You speake a Language that I vnderstand not
My Life stands in the leuell of your Dreames
Which Ile lay downe

 Leo Your Actions are my Dreames
You had a Bastard by Polixenes
And I but dreamd it As you were past all shame
Those of your Fact are so so past all truth
Which to deny concernes more then auailes for as
Thy Brat hath been cast out like to it selfe
No Father owning it which is indeed
More criminall in thee then it so thou
Shalt feele our Iustice in whose easiest passage
Looke for no lesse then death

 Her Sir spare your Threats
The Bugge which you would fright me with I seeke
To me can Life be no commoditie
The crowne and comfort of my Life your Fauor
I doe giue lost for I doe feele it gone
But know not how it went My second Ioy
And first Fruits of my body from his presence
I am bard like one infectious My third comfort
Stard most vnluckily is from my breast
The innocent milke in it most innocent mouth
Hald out to murther My selfe on euery Post
Proclaymd a Strumpet With immodest hatred
The Childbed priuiledge denyd which longs
To Women of all fashion Lastly hurried
Here to this place ith open ayre before
I haue got strength of limit Now my Liege
Tell me what blessings I haue here aliue
That I should feare to die Therefore proceed
But yet heare this mistake me not no Life
I prize it not a straw but for mine Honor
Which I would free if I shall be condemnd
Vpon surmizes all proofes sleeping else
But what your Iealousies awake I tell you
Tis Rigor and not Law Your Honors all
I doe referre me to the Oracle
Apollo be my Iudge

 Lord This your request
Is altogether iust therefore bring forth
And in Apollos Name his Oracle

 Her The Emperor of Russia was my Father
Oh that he were aliue and here beholding
His Daughters Tryall that he did but see
The flatnesse of my miserie yet with eyes
Of Pitty not Reuenge

 Officer You here shal sweare vpon this Sword of Iustice
That you Cleomines and Dion haue
Been both at Delphos and from thence haue brought
This sealdvp Oracle by the Hand deliuerd
Of great Apollos Priest and that since then
You haue not dard to breake the holy Seale
Nor read the Secrets int

 Cleo Dio All this we sweare

 Leo Breake vp the Seales and read

 Officer Hermione is chast Polixenes blamelesse Camillo
a true Subiect Leontes a iealous Tyrant his innocent Babe
truly begotten and the King shall liue without an Heire if that
which is lost be not found

 Lords Now blessed be the great Apollo

 Her Praysed

 Leo Hast thou read truth
 Offic I my Lord euen so as it is here set downe

 Leo There is no truth at all ith Oracle
The Sessions shall proceed this is meere falsehood

 Ser My Lord the King the King
 Leo What is the businesse
 Ser O Sir I shall be hated to report it
The Prince your Sonne with meere conceit and feare
Of the Queenes speed is gone

 Leo How gone
 Ser Is dead

 Leo Apollos angry and the Heauens themselues
Doe strike at my Iniustice How now there
 Paul This newes is mortall to the Queene Look downe
And see what Death is doing

 Leo Take her hence
Her heart is but orechargd she will recouer
I haue too much beleeud mine owne suspition
Beseech you tenderly apply to her
Some remedies for life Apollo pardon
My great prophanenesse gainst thine Oracle
Ile reconcile me to Polixenes
New woe my Queene recall the good Camillo
Whom I proclaime a man of Truth of Mercy
For being transported by my Iealousies
To bloody thoughts and to reuenge I chose
Camillo for the minister to poyson
My friend Polixenes which had been done
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
My swift command though I with Death and with
Reward did threaten and encourage him
Not doing it and being done he most humane
And filld with Honor to my Kingly Guest
Vnclaspd my practise quit his fortunes here
Which you knew great and to the hazard
Of all Incertainties himselfe commended
No richer then his Honor How he glisters
Through my Rust and how his Pietie
Dos my deeds make the blacker
 Paul Woe the while
O cut my Lace least my heart cracking it
Breake too

 Lord What fit is this good Lady
 Paul What studied torments Tyrant hast for me
What Wheeles Racks Fires What flaying boyling
In Leads or Oyles What old or newer Torture
Must I receiue whose euery word deserues
To taste of thy most worst Thy Tyranny
Together working with thy Iealousies
Fancies too weake for Boyes too greene and idle
For Girles of Nine O thinke what they haue done
And then run mad indeed starkemad for all
Thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it
That thou betrayedst Polixenes twas nothing
That did but shew thee of a Foole inconstant
And damnable ingratefull Nor wast much
Thou wouldst haue poysond good Camillos Honor
To haue him kill a King poore Trespasses
More monstrous standing by whereof I reckon
The casting forth to Crowes thy Babydaughter
To be or none or little though a Deuill
Would haue shed water out of fire ere dont
Nor ist directly layd to thee the death
Of the young Prince whose honorable thoughts
Thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart
That could conceiue a grosse and foolish Sire
Blemishd his gracious Dam this is not no
Layd to thy answere but the last O Lords
When I haue said cry woe the Queene the Queene
The sweetst deerst creatures dead  vengeance fort
Not dropd downe yet

 Lord The higher powres forbid

 Pau I say shes dead Ile sweart If word nor oath
Preuaile not go and see if you can bring
Tincture or lustre in her lip her eye
Heate outwardly or breath within Ile serue you
As I would do the Gods But O thou Tyrant
Do not repent these things for they are heauier
Then all thy woes can stirre therefore betake thee
To nothing but dispaire A thousand knees
Ten thousand yeares together naked fasting
Vpon a barren Mountaine and still Winter
In storme perpetuall could not moue the Gods
To looke that way thou wert

 Leo Go on go on
Thou canst not speake too much I haue deserud
All tongues to talke their bittrest

 Lord Say no more
How ere the businesse goes you haue made fault
Ith boldnesse of your speech

 Pau I am sorry fort
All faults I make when I shall come to know them
I do repent Alas I haue shewd too much
The rashnesse of a woman he is toucht
To th Noble heart Whats gone and whats past helpe
Should be past greefe Do not receiue affliction
At my petition I beseech you rather
Let me be punishd that haue minded you
Of what you should forget Now good my Liege
Sir Royall Sir forgiue a foolish woman
The loue I bore your Queene Lo foole againe
Ile speake of her no more nor of your Children
Ile not remember you of my owne Lord
Who is lost too take your patience to you
And Ile say nothing

 Leo Thou didst speake but well
When most the truth which I receyue much better
Then to be pittied of thee Prethee bring me
To the dead bodies of my Queene and Sonne
One graue shall be for both Vpon them shall
The causes of their death appeare vnto
Our shame perpetuall once a day Ile visit
The Chappell where they lye and teares shed there
Shall be my recreation So long as Nature
Will beare vp with this exercise so long
I dayly vow to vse it Come and leade me
To these sorrowes

Sometimes her head on one side some another
I neuer saw a vessell of like sorrow
So filld and so becomming in pure white Robes
Like very sanctity she did approach
My Cabine where I lay thrice bowd before me
And gasping to begin some speech her eyes
Became two spouts the furie spent anon
Did this breake from her Good Antigonus
Since Fate against thy better disposition
Hath made thy person for the Throwerout
Of my poore babe according to thine oath
Places remote enough are in Bohemia
There weepe and leaue it crying and for the babe
Is counted lost for euer Perdita
I prethee callt For this vngentle businesse
Put on thee by my Lord thou nere shalt see
Thy Wife Paulina more and so with shriekes
She melted into Ayre Affrighted much
I did in time collect my selfe and thought
This was so and no slumber Dreames are toyes
Yet for this once yea superstitiously
I will be squard by this I do beleeue
Hermione hath sufferd death and that
Apollo would this being indeede the issue
Of King Polixenes it should heere be laide
Either for life or death vpon the earth
Of its right Father Blossome speed thee well
There lye and there thy charracter there these
Which may if Fortune please both breed thee pretty
And still rest thine The storme beginnes poore wretch
That for thy mothers fault art thus exposd
To losse and what may follow Weepe I cannot
But my heart bleedes and most accurst am I
To be by oath enioynd to this Farewell
The day frownes more and more thourt like to haue
A lullabie too rough I neuer saw
The heauens so dim by day A sauage clamor
Well may I get aboord This is the Chace
I am gone for euer

To speake of Perdita now growne in grace
Equall with wondring What of her insues
I list not prophesie but let Times newes
Be knowne when tis brought forth A shepherds daughter
And what to her adheres which followes after
Is th argument of Time of this allow
If euer you haue spent time worse ere now
If neuer yet that Time himselfe doth say
He wishes earnestly you neuer may

Enter Polixenes and Camillo

 Pol I pray thee good Camillo be no more importunate
tis a sicknesse denying thee any thing a death to
grant this

 Cam It is fifteene yeeres since I saw my Countrey
though I haue for the most part bin ayred abroad I desire
to lay my bones there Besides the penitent King
my Master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrowes
I might be some allay or I oreweene to thinke so which
is another spurre to my departure

 Pol As thou loust me Camillo wipe not out the rest
of thy seruices by leauing me now the neede I haue of
thee thine owne goodnesse hath made better not to
haue had thee then thus to want thee thou hauing made
me Businesses which none without thee can sufficiently
manage must either stay to execute them thy selfe
or take away with thee the very seruices thou hast done
which if I haue not enough considered as too much I
cannot to bee more thankefull to thee shall bee my studie
and my profite therein the heaping friendshippes
Of that fatall Countrey Sicillia prethee speake no more
whose very naming punnishes me with the remembrance
of that penitent as thou calst him and reconciled King
my brother whose losse of his most precious Queene 
Children are euen now to be afresh lamented Say to
me when sawst thou the Prince Florizell my son Kings
are no lesse vnhappy their issue not being gracious then
they are in loosing them when they haue approued their
Vertues

 Cam Sir it is three dayes since I saw the Prince what
his happier affayres may be are to me vnknowne but I
haue missingly noted he is of late much retyred from
Court and is lesse frequent to his Princely exercises then
formerly he hath appeared

 Pol I haue considered so much Camillo and with
some care so farre that I haue eyes vnder my seruice
which looke vpon his remouednesse from whom I haue
this Intelligence that he is seldome from the house of a
most homely shepheard a man they say that from very
nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbors
is growne into an vnspeakable estate

 Cam I haue heard sir of such a man who hath a
daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended
more then can be thought to begin from such a cottage
 Pol Thats likewise part of my Intelligence but I
feare the Angle that pluckes our sonne thither Thou
shalt accompany vs to the place where we will not appearing
what we are haue some question with the shepheard
from whose simplicity I thinke it not vneasie to
get the cause of my sonnes resort thether Prethe be my
present partner in this busines and lay aside the thoughts
of Sicillia

 Cam I willingly obey your command

 Pol My best Camillo we must disguise our selues

There is an Art which in their pidenesse shares
With great creatingNature

 Pol Say there be
Yet Nature is made better by no meane
But Nature makes that Meane so ouer that Art
Which you say addes to Nature is an Art
That Nature makes you see sweet Maid we marry
A gentler Sien to the wildest Stocke
And make conceyue a barke of baser kinde
By bud of Nobler race This is an Art
Which dos mend Nature change it rather but
The Art it selfe is Nature

 Perd So it is

 Pol Then make you Garden rich in Gilly vors
And do not call them bastards

 Perd Ile not put
The Dible in earth to set one slip of them

This youth should say twer well and onely therefore
Desire to breed by me Heres flowres for you
Hot Lauender Mints Sauory Mariorum
The Marygold that goes to bed with Sun
And with him rises weeping These are flowres

And onely liue by gazing

 Perd Out alas
Yould be so leane that blasts of Ianuary
Would blow you through and through Now my fairst Friend
I would I had some Flowres oth Spring that might
Become your time of day and yours and yours
That weare vpon your Virginbranches yet
Your Maidenheads growing O Proserpina
For the Flowres now that frighted thou letst fall
From Dysses Waggon Daffadils
That come before the Swallow dares and take
The windes of March with beauty Violets dim
But sweeter then the lids of Iunos eyes
Or Cythereas breath pale Primeroses
That dye vnmarried ere they can behold
Bright Phoebus in his strength a Maladie
Most incident to Maids bold Oxlips and
The Crowne Imperiall Lillies of all kinds
The FlowredeLuce being one O these I lacke
To make you Garlands of and my sweet friend
To strew him ore and ore

 Flo What like a Coarse
 Perd No like a banke for Loue to lye and play on
Not like a Coarse or if not to be buried

So singular in each particular
Crownes what you are doing in the present deeds
That all your Actes are Queenes

 Perd O Doricles
Your praises are too large but that your youth
And the true blood which peepes fairely throught
Do plainly giue you out an vnstaind Shepherd
With wisedome I might feare my Doricles

 Ser Why they stay at doore Sir

Heere a Dance of twelue Satyres

 Pol O Father youl know more of that heereafter
Is it not too farre gone Tis time to part them
Hes simple and tels much How now faire shepheard
Your heart is full of something that dos take
Your minde from feasting Sooth when I was yong
And handed loue as you do I was wont
To load my Shee with knackes I would haue ransackt
The Pedlers silken Treasury and haue powrd it
To her acceptance you haue let him go
And nothing marted with him If your Lasse
Interpretation should abuse and call this
Your lacke of loue or bounty you were straited
For a reply at least if you make a care
Of happie holding her

 Flo Old Sir I know
She prizes not such trifles as these are
The gifts she lookes from me are packt and lockt
Vp in my heart which I haue giuen already
But not deliuerd O heare me breath my life
Before this ancient Sir whom it should seeme
Hath sometime loud I take thy hand this hand
As soft as Douesdowne and as white as it
Or Ethyopians tooth or the fand snow thats bolted
By th Northerne blasts twice ore

 Pol What followes this
How prettily th yong Swaine seemes to wash
The hand was faire before I haue put you out
But to your protestation Let me heare
What you professe

 Flo Do and be witnesse toot

 Pol And this my neighbour too
 Flo And he and more
Then he and men the earth the heauens and all
That were I crownd the most Imperiall Monarch
Thereof most worthy were I the fayrest youth
That euer made eye swerue had force and knowledge
More then was euer mans I would not prize them
Without her Loue for her employ them all
Commend them and condemne them to her seruice
Or to their owne perdition

 Pol Fairely offerd

 Cam This shewes a sound affection

 Shep But my daughter
Say you the like to him

 Per I cannot speake
So well nothing so well no nor meane better
By th patterne of mine owne thoughts I cut out
The puritie of his

 Shep Take hands a bargaine
And friends vnknowne you shall beare witnesse tot

Her Portion equall his

 Flo O that must bee
Ith Vertue of your daughter One being dead

Contract vs fore these Witnesses

 Shep Come your hand
And daughter yours

 Pol Soft Swaine awhile beseech you
Haue you a Father
 Flo I haue but what of him
 Pol Knowes he of this
 Flo He neither dos nor shall

 Pol Methinkes a Father
Is at the Nuptiall of his sonne a guest
That best becomes the Table Pray you once more
Is not your Father growne incapeable
Of reasonable affayres Is he not stupid
With Age and altring Rheumes Can he speake heare
Know man from man Dispute his owne estate
Lies he not bedrid And againe dos nothing
But what he did being childish
 Flo No good Sir
He has his health and ampler strength indeede
Then most haue of his age

 Pol By my white beard
You offer him if this be so a wrong
Something vnfilliall Reason my sonne
Should choose himselfe a wife but as good reason
The Father all whose ioy is nothing else
But faire posterity should hold some counsaile
In such a businesse

 Flo I yeeld all this
But for some other reasons my graue Sir
Which tis not fit you know I not acquaint
My Father of this businesse

 Pol Let him knowt

 Flo He shall not

 Pol Prethee let him

 Flo No he must not

 Shep Let him my sonne he shall not need to greeue
At knowing of thy choice

 Flo Come come he must not
Marke our Contract

 Pol Marke your diuorce yong sir
Whom sonne I dare not call Thou art too base
To be acknowledge Thou a Scepters heire
That thus affects a sheepehooke Thou old Traitor
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
But shorten thy life one weeke And thou fresh peece
Of excellent Witchcraft whom of force must know
The royall Foole thou coapst with

 Shep Oh my heart

 Pol Ile haue thy beauty scratcht with briers  made
More homely then thy state For thee fond boy
If I may euer know thou dost but sigh
That thou no more shalt neuer see this knacke as neuer
I meane thou shalt weel barre thee from succession
Not hold thee of our blood no not our Kin
Farre then Deucalion off marke thou my words
Follow vs to the Court Thou Churle for this time
Though full of our displeasure yet we free thee
From the dead blow of it And you Enchantment
Worthy enough a Heardsman yea him too
That makes himselfe but for our Honor therein
Vnworthy thee If euer henceforth thou
These rurall Latches to his entrance open
Or hope his body more with thy embraces
I will deuise a death as cruell for thee
As thou art tender tot
Enter

 Perd Euen heere vndone
I was not much afeard for once or twice
I was about to speake and tell him plainely
The selfesame Sun that shines vpon his Court
Hides not his visage from our Cottage but
Lookes on alike Wilt please you Sir be gone
I told you what would come of this Beseech you
Of your owne state take care This dreame of mine
Being now awake Ile Queene it no inch farther
But milke my Ewes and weepe

 Cam Why how now Father
Speake ere thou dyest

 Shep I cannot speake nor thinke
Nor dare to know that which I know O Sir
You haue vndone a man of fourescore three
That thought to fill his graue in quiet yea
To dye vpon the bed my father dyde
To lye close by his honest bones but now
Some Hangman must put on my shrowd and lay me
Where no Priest shouelsin dust Oh cursed wretch
That knewst this was the Prince and wouldst aduenture
To mingle faith with him Vndone vndone
If I might dye within this houre I haue liud
To die when I desire
Enter

 Flo Why looke you so vpon me
I am but sorry not affeard delaid
But nothing altred What I was I am
More straining on for plucking backe not following
My leash vnwillingly

 Cam Gracious my Lord
You know my Fathers temper at this time
He will allow no speech which I do ghesse
You do not purpose to him and as hardly
Will he endure your sight as yet I feare
Then till the fury of his Highnesse settle
Come not before him

 Flo I not purpose it
I thinke Camillo

 Cam Euen he my Lord

 Per How often haue I told you twould be thus
How often said my dignity would last
But till twer knowne
 Flo It cannot faile but by
The violation of my faith and then
Let Nature crush the sides oth earth together
And marre the seeds within Lift vp thy lookes
From my succession wipe me Father I
Am heyre to my affection

 Cam Be aduisd

 Flo I am and by my fancie if my Reason
Will thereto be obedient I haue reason
If not my sences better pleasd with madnesse
Do bid it welcome

 Cam This is desperate sir
 Flo So call it but it dos fulfill my vow
I needs must thinke it honesty Camillo
Not for Bohemia nor the pompe that may
Be thereat gleaned for all the Sun sees or
The close earth wombes or the profound seas hides
In vnknowne fadomes will I breake my oath
To this my faire beloud Therefore I pray you
As you haue euer bin my Fathers honourd friend
When he shall misse me as in faith I meane not
To see him any more cast your good counsailes
Vpon his passion Let my selfe and Fortune
Tug for the time to come This you may know
And so deliuer I am put to Sea
With her who heere I cannot hold on shore
And most opportune to her neede I haue
A Vessell rides fast by but not prepard
For this designe What course I meane to hold
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
Concerne me the reporting

 Cam O my Lord
I would your spirit were easier for aduice
Or stronger for your neede

 Flo Hearke Perdita
Ile heare you by and by

 Cam Hees irremoueable
Resolud for flight Now were I happy if
His going I could frame to serue my turne
Saue him from danger do him loue and honor
Purchase the sight againe of deere Sicillia
And that vnhappy King my Master whom
I so much thirst to see

 Flo Now good Camillo
I am so fraught with curious businesse that
I leaue out ceremony

 Cam Sir I thinke
You haue heard of my poore seruices ith loue
That I haue borne your Father
 Flo Very nobly
Haue you deserud It is my Fathers Musicke
To speake your deeds not little of his care
To haue them recompencd as thought on

 Cam Well my Lord
If you may please to thinke I loue the King
And through him whats neerest to him which is
Your gracious selfe embrace but my direction
If your more ponderous and setled proiect
May suffer alteration On mine honor
Ile point you where you shall haue such receiuing
As shall become your Highnesse where you may
Enioy your Mistris from the whom I see
Theres no disiunction to be made but by
As heauens forefend your ruine Marry her
And with my best endeuours in your absence
Your discontenting Father striue to qualifie
And bring him vp to liking

 Flo How Camillo
May this almost a miracle be done
That I may call thee something more then man
And after that trust to thee

 Cam Haue you thought on
A place whereto youl go
 Flo Not any yet
But as th vnthoughton accident is guiltie
To what we wildely do so we professe
Our selues to be the slaues of chance and flyes
Of euery winde that blowes

 Cam Then list to me
This followes if you will not change your purpose
But vndergo this flight make for Sicillia
And there present your selfe and your fayre Princesse
For so I see she must be fore Leontes
She shall be habited as it becomes
The partner of your Bed Me thinkes I see
Leontes opening his free Armes and weeping
His Welcomes forth asks thee there Sonne forgiuenesse
As twere ith Fathers person kisses the hands
Of your fresh Princesse ore and ore diuides him
Twixt his vnkindnesse and his Kindnesse th one
He chides to Hell and bids the other grow
Faster then Thought or Time

 Flo Worthy Camillo
What colour for my Visitation shall I
Hold vp before him
 Cam Sent by the King your Father
To greet him and to giue him comforts Sir
The manner of your bearing towards him with
What you as from your Father shall deliuer
Things knowne betwixt vs three Ile write you downe
The which shall point you forth at euery sitting
What you must say that he shall not perceiue
But that you haue your Fathers Bosome there
And speake his very Heart

 Flo I am bound to you
There is some sappe in this

 Cam A Course more promising
Then a wild dedication of your selues
To vnpathd Waters vndreamd Shores most certaine
To Miseries enough no hope to helpe you
But as you shake off one to take another
Nothing so certaine as your Anchors who
Doe their best office if they can but stay you
Where youle be loth to be besides you know
Prosperities the very bond of Loue
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters

 Perd One of these is true
I thinke Affliction may subdue the Cheeke
But not takein the Mind

 Cam Yea say you so
There shall not at your Fathers House these seuen yeeres
Be borne another such

 Flo My good Camillo
Shes as forward of her Breeding as
She is ith reare our Birth

 Cam I cannot say tis pitty
She lacks Instructions for she seemes a Mistresse
To most that teach

 Perd Your pardon Sir for this
Ile blush you Thanks

 Flo My prettiest Perdita
But O the Thornes we stand vpon Camillo
Preseruer of my Father now of me
The Medicine of our House how shall we doe
We are not furnishd like Bohemias Sonne
Nor shall appeare in Sicilia

 Cam My Lord
Feare none of this I thinke you know my fortunes
Doe all lye there it shall be so my care
To haue you royally appointed as if
The Scene you play were mine For instance Sir
That you may know you shall not want one word

Perdita

 Cleo Sir you haue done enough and haue performd
A Saintlike Sorrow No fault could you make
Which you haue not redeemd indeed payd downe
More penitence then done trespas At the last
Doe as the Heauens haue done forget your euill
With them forgiue your selfe

 Leo Whilest I remember
Her and her Vertues I cannot forget
My blemishes in them and so still thinke of
The wrong I did my selfe which was so much
That Heirelesse it hath made my Kingdome and
Destroyd the sweetst Companion that ere man
Bred his hopes out of true

 Paul Too true my Lord
If one by one you wedded all the World
Or from the All that are tooke something good
To make a perfect Woman she you killd
Would be vnparallelld

 Leo I thinke so Killd
She I killd I did so but thou strikst me
Sorely to say I did it is as bitter
Vpon thy Tongue as in my Thought Now good now
Say so but seldome

 Cleo Not at all good Lady
You might haue spoken a thousand things that would
Haue done the time more benefit and gracd
Your kindnesse better

 Paul You are one of those
Would haue him wed againe

 Dio If you would not so
You pitty not the State nor the Remembrance
Of his most Soueraigne Name Consider little
What Dangers by his Highnesse faile of Issue
May drop vpon his Kingdome and deuoure
Incertaine lookers on What were more holy
Then to reioyce the former Queene is well
What holyer then for Royalties repayre
For present comfort and for future good
To blesse the Bed of Maiestie againe
With a sweet Fellow tot
 Paul There is none worthy
Respecting her thats gone besides the Gods
Will haue fulfilld their secret purposes
For has not the Diuine Apollo said
Ist not the tenor of his Oracle
That King Leontes shall not haue an Heire
Till his lost Child be found Which that it shall
Is all as monstrous to our humane reason
As my Antigonus to breake his Graue
And come againe to me who on my life
Did perish with the Infant Tis your councell
My Lord should to the Heauens be contrary
Oppose against their wills Care not for Issue
The Crowne will find an Heire Great Alexander
Left his to th Worthiest so his Successor
Was like to be the best

 Leo Good Paulina
Who hast the memorie of Hermione
I know in honor O that euer I
Had squard me to thy councell then euen now
I might haue lookd vpon my Queenes full eyes

 Leo Thou speakst truth
No more such Wiues therefore no Wife one worse
And better vsd would make her Sainted Spirit
Againe possesse her Corps and on this Stage
Where we Offendors now appeare Soulevext
And begin why to me
 Paul Had she such power
She had iust such cause

 Leo She had and would incense me
To murther her I marryed

 Paul I should so
Were I the Ghost that walkd Ild bid you marke
Her eye and tell me for what dull part int
You chose her then Ild shrieke that euen your eares
Should rift to heare me and the words that followd
Should be Remember mine

 Leo Starres Starres
And all eyes else dead coales feare thou no Wife
Ile haue no Wife Paulina

 Paul Will you sweare
Neuer to marry but by my free leaue
 Leo Neuer Paulina so be blessd my Spirit

 Paul Then good my Lords beare witnesse to his Oath

 Cleo You tempt him ouermuch

 Paul Vnlesse another
As like Hermione as is her Picture
Affront his eye

 Cleo Good Madame I haue done

 Paul Yet if my Lord will marry if you will Sir
No remedie but you will Giue me the Office
To chuse you a Queene she shall not be so young
As was your former but she shall be such
As walkd your first Queenes Ghost it should take ioy
To see her in your armes

We shall not marry till thou bidst vs

Shall be when your first Queenes againe in breath

 Leo His Princesse say you with him

Aboue a better gone so must thy Graue
Giue way to whats seene now Sir you your selfe
Haue said and writ so but your writing now
Is colder then that Theame she had not beene
Nor was not to be equalld thus your Verse
Flowd with her Beautie once tis shrewdly ebbd
To say you haue seene a better

 Ser Pardon Madame
The one I haue almost forgot your pardon
The other when she has obtaynd your Eye
Will haue your Tongue too This is a Creature
Would she begin a Sect might quench the zeale
Of all Professors else make Proselytes
Of who she but bid follow

 Paul How not women
 Ser Women will loue her that she is a Woman
More worth then any Man Men that she is
The rarest of all Women

Though bearing Miserie I desire my life
Once more to looke on him

 Flo By his command
Haue I here touchd Sicilia and from him
Giue you all greetings that a King at friend
Can send his Brother and but Infirmitie
Which waits vpon worne times hath something seizd
His wishd Abilitie he had himselfe

Measurd to looke vpon you whom he loues
He bad me say so more then all the Scepters
And those that beare them liuing

 Leo Oh my Brother
Good Gentleman the wrongs I haue done thee stirre
Afresh within me and these thy offices
So rarely kind are as Interpreters
Of my behindhand slacknesse Welcome hither
As is the Spring to th Earth And hath he too
Exposd this Paragon to th fearefull vsage
At least vngentle of the dreadfull Neptune
To greet a man not worth her paines much lesse
Th aduenture of her person
 Flo Good my Lord
She came from Libia

 Leo Where the Warlike Smalus
That Noble honord Lord is feard and loud
 Flo Most Royall Sir

To execute the Charge my Father gaue me
For visiting your Highnesse My best Traine
I haue from your Sicilian Shores dismissd
Who for Bohemia bend to signifie
Not onely my successe in Libia Sir
But my arriuall and my Wifes in safetie
Here where we are

 Leo The blessed Gods
Purge all Infection from our Ayre whilest you
Doe Clymate here you haue a holy Father
A graceful Gentleman against whose person
So sacred as it is I haue done sinne
For which the Heauens taking angry note

Fled from his Father from his Hopes and with
A Shepheards Daughter

 Leo Wheres Bohemia speake
 Lord Here in your Citie I now came from him
I speake amazedly and it becomes
My meruaile and my Message To your Court
Whiles he was hastning in the Chase it seemes
Of this faire Couple meetes he on the way

Her Brother hauing both their Countrey quitted

Whose honor and whose honestie till now

 Lord Camillo Sir I spake with him who now
Has these poore men in question Neuer saw I

Enter Autolicus and a Gentleman

 Aut Beseech you Sir were you present at this Relation
 Gent1 I was by at the opening of the Farthell heard
the old Shepheard deliuer the manner how he found it
Whereupon after a little amazednesse we were all commanded
out of the Chamber onely this me thought I
heard the Shepheard say he found the Child

 Aut I would most gladly know the issue of it

 Gent1 I make a broken deliuerie of the Businesse
but the changes I perceiued in the King and Camillo were
very Notes of admiration they seemd almost with staring
on one another to teare the Cases of their Eyes
There was speech in their dumbnesse Language in their
very gesture they lookd as they had heard of a World
ransomd or one destroyed a notable passion of Wonder
appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew
no more but seeing could not say if th importance were
Ioy or Sorrow but in the extremitie of the one it must
needs be
Enter another Gentleman

Here comes a Gentleman that happily knowes more
The Newes Rogero

 Gent2 Nothing but Bonfires the Oracle is fulfilld
the Kings Daughter is found such a deale of wonder is
broken out within this houre that Balladmakers cannot
be able to expresse it
Enter another Gentleman

Here comes the Lady Paulinas Steward hee can deliuer
you more How goes it now Sir This Newes which
is calld true is so like an old Tale that the veritie of it is
in strong suspition Has the King found his Heire
 Gent3 Most true if euer Truth were pregnant by
Circumstance That which you heare youle sweare
you see there is such vnitie in the proofes The Mantle
of Queene Hermiones her Iewell about the Neck of it
the Letters of Antigonus found with it which they know
to be his Character the Maiestie of the Creature in resemblance
of the Mother the Affection of Noblenesse
which Nature shewes aboue her Breeding and many other
Euidences proclayme her with all certaintie to be
the Kings Daughter Did you see the meeting of the
two Kings
 Gent2 No

 Gent3 Then haue you lost a Sight which was to bee
seene cannot bee spoken of There might you haue beheld
one Ioy crowne another so and in such manner that
it seemd Sorrow wept to take leaue of them for their
Ioy waded in teares There was casting vp of Eyes holding
vp of Hands with Countenance of such distraction
that they were to be knowne by Garment not by Fauor
Our King being ready to leape out of himselfe for ioy of
his found Daughter as if that Ioy were now become a
Losse cryes Oh thy Mother thy Mother then askes
Bohemia forgiuenesse then embraces his SonneinLaw
then againe worryes he his Daughter with clipping her
Now he thanks the old Shepheard which stands by like
a Weatherbitten Conduit of many Kings Reignes I
neuer heard of such another Encounter which lames Report
to follow it and vndos description to doe it

 Gent2 What pray you became of Antigonus that
carryed hence the Child
 Gent3 Like an old Tale still which will haue matter
to rehearse though Credit be asleepe and not an eare open
he was torne to pieces with a Beare This auouches
the Shepheards Sonne who has not onely his Innocence
which seemes much to iustifie him but a Handkerchief
and Rings of his that Paulina knowes

 Gent1 What became of his Barke and his Followers
 Gent3 Wrackt the same instant of their Masters
death and in the view of the Shepheard so that all the
Instruments which ayded to expose the Child were euen
then lost when it was found But oh the Noble Combat
that twixt Ioy and Sorrow was fought in Paulina Shee
had one Eye declind for the losse of her Husband another
eleuated that the Oracle was fulfilld Shee lifted the
Princesse from the Earth and so locks her in embracing
as if shee would pin her to her heart that shee might no
more be in danger of loosing

 Gent1 The Dignitie of this Act was worth the audience
of Kings and Princes for by such was it acted

 Gent3 One of the prettyest touches of all and that
which angld for mine Eyes caught the Water though
not the Fish was when at the Relation of the Queenes
death with the manner how shee came tot brauely confessd
and lamented by the King how attentiuenesse
wounded his Daughter till from one signe of dolour to
another shee did with an Alas I would faine say bleed
Teares for I am sure my heart wept blood Who was
most Marble there changed colour some swownded all
sorrowed if all the World could haue seent the Woe
had beene vniuersall

 Gent1 Are they returned to the Court
 Gent3 No The Princesse hearing of her Mothers
Statue which is in the keeping of Paulina a Peece many
yeeres in doing and now newly performd by that rare
Italian Master Iulio Romano who had he himselfe Eternitie
and could put Breath into his Worke would beguile
Nature of her Custome so perfectly he is her Ape
He so neere to Hermione hath done Hermione that they
say one would speake to her and stand in hope of answer
Thither with all greedinesse of affection are they gone
and there they intend to Sup

 Gent2 I thought she had some great matter there in
hand for shee hath priuately twice or thrice a day euer
since the death of Hermione visited that remoued House
Shall wee thither and with our companie peece the Reioycing
 Gent1 Who would be thence that has the benefit
of Accesse euery winke of an Eye some new Grace

You haue payd home But that you haue vouchsafd
With your Crownd Brother and these your contracted
Heires of your Kingdomes my poore House to visit
It is a surplus of your Grace which neuer
My life may last to answere

 Leo O Paulina
We honor you with trouble but we came
To see the Statue of our Queene Your Gallerie
Haue we passd through not without much content
In many singularities but we saw not
That which my Daughter came to looke vpon
The Statue of her Mother

 Paul As she liud peerelesse
So her dead likenesse I doe well beleeue
Excells what euer yet you lookd vpon
Or hand of Man hath done therefore I keepe it
Louely apart But here it is prepare
To see the Life as liuely mockd as euer
Still Sleepe mockd Death behold and say tis well
I like your silence it the more shewesoff
Your wonder but yet speake first you my Liege
Comes it not something neere
 Leo Her naturall Posture
Chide me deare Stone that I may say indeed

So aged as this seemes

 Pol Oh not by much

 Paul So much the more our Caruers excellence
Which lets goeby some sixteene yeeres and makes her
As she liud now

 Leo As now she might haue done
So much to my good comfort as it is
Now piercing to my Soule Oh thus she stood
Euen with such Life of Maiestie warme Life
As now it coldly stands when first I wood her
I am ashamd Dos not the Stone rebuke me
For being more Stone then it Oh Royall Peece
Theres Magick in thy Maiestie which has
My Euils coniurd to remembrance and
From thy admiring Daughter tooke the Spirits
Standing like Stone with thee

 Perd And giue me leaue
And doe not say tis Superstition that

Deere Queene that ended when I but began
Giue me that hand of yours to kisse

 Paul O patience
The Statue is but newly fixd the Colours
Not dry

 Cam My Lord your Sorrow was too sore laydon
Which sixteene Winters cannot blow away
So many Summers dry scarce any Ioy
Did euer so long liue no Sorrow
But killd it selfe much sooner

 Pol Deere my Brother
Let him that was the cause of this haue powre
To takeoff so much griefe from you as he
Will peece vp in himselfe

 Paul Indeed my Lord
If I had thought the sight of my poore Image
Would thus haue wrought you for the Stone is mine
Ild not haue shewd it

 Leo Doe not draw the Curtaine

 Paul No longer shall you gaze ont least your Fancie
May thinke anon it moues

 Leo Let be let be
Would I were dead but that me thinkes alreadie
What was he that did make it See my Lord
Would you not deeme it breathd and that those veines
Did verily beare blood
 Pol Masterly done

 Paul Ile draw the Curtaine
My Lords almost so farre transported that
Heele thinke anon it liues

 Leo Oh sweet Paulina

No setled Sences of the World can match
The pleasure of that madnesse Lett alone

 Paul I am sorry Sir I haue thus farre stird you but
I could afflict you farther

 Leo Doe Paulina
For this Affliction has a taste as sweet
As any Cordiall comfort Still me thinkes
There is an ayre comes from her What fine Chizzell
Could euer yet cut breath Let no man mock me
For I will kisse her

 Paul Good my Lord forbeare
The ruddinesse vpon her Lippe is wet
Youle marre it if you kisse it stayne your owne
With Oyly Painting shall I draw the Curtaine

 Leo No not these twentie yeeres

 Perd So long could I
Standby a lookeron

 Paul Either forbeare
Quit presently the Chappell or resolue you
For more amazement if you can behold it
Ile make the Statue moue indeed descend
And take you by the hand but then youle thinke
Which I protest against I am assisted
By wicked Powers

 Leo What you can make her doe
I am content to looke on what to speake
I am content to heare for tis as easie
To make her speake as moue

 Paul It is requird
You doe awake your Faith then all stand still
On those that thinke it is vnlawfull Businesse
I am about let them depart

 Leo Proceed
No foot shall stirre

 Paul Musick awake her Strike
Tis time descend be Stone no more approach
Strike all that looke vpon with meruaile Come
Ile fill your Graue vp stirre nay come away
Bequeath to Death your numnesse for from him
Deare Life redeemes you you perceiue she stirres
Start not her Actions shall be holy as
You heare my Spell is lawfull doe not shun her
Vntill you see her dye againe for then
You kill her double Nay present your Hand
When she was young you wood her now in age
Is she become the Suitor
 Leo Oh shes warme
If this be Magick let it be an Art
Lawfull as Eating

 Pol She embraces him

 Cam She hangs about his necke
If she pertaine to life let her speake too

 Pol I and make it manifest where she has liud
Or how stolne from the dead
 Paul That she is liuing
Were it but told you should be hooted at
Like an old Tale but it appeares she liues
Though yet she speake not Marke a little while
Please you to interpose faire Madam kneele
And pray your Mothers blessing turne good Lady

And from your sacred Viols poure your graces
Vpon my daughters head Tell me mine owne
Where hast thou bin preserud Where liud How found

Knowing by Paulina that the Oracle
Gaue hope thou wast in being haue preserud

 Paul Theres time enough for that
Least they desire vpon this push to trouble
Your ioyes with like Relation Go together
You precious winners all your exultation
Partake to euery one I an old Turtle
Will wing me to some witherd bough and there
My Mate thats neuer to be found againe
Lament till I am lost

 Leo O peace Paulina
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent
As I by thine a Wife This is a Match
And made betweenes by Vowes Thou hast found mine
But how is to be questiond for I saw her
As I thought dead and haue in vaine said many
A prayer vpon her graue Ile not seeke farre
For him I partly know his minde to finde thee
An honourable husband Come Camillo
And take her by the hand whose worth and honesty
Is richly noted and heere iustified
By Vs a paire of Kings Lets from this place
What looke vpon my Brother both your pardons
That ere I put betweene your holy lookes
