ACT ONE

SCENE I Music Master Dancing Master Musicians and Dancers

The play opens with a great assembly of instruments and in the
middle of the stage is a pupil of the Music Master seated at a
table composing a melody which Monsieur Jourdain has ordered for a
serenade

MUSIC MASTER To Musicians Come come into this room sit there
and wait until he comes

DANCING MASTER To dancers And you too on this side

MUSIC MASTER To Pupil Is it done

PUPIL Yes

MUSIC MASTER Lets see This is good

DANCING MASTER Is it something new

MUSIC MASTER Yes its a melody for a serenade that I set him to
composing here while waiting for our man to awake

DANCING MASTER May I see it

MUSIC MASTER Youll hear it with the dialogue when he comes He
wont be long

DANCING MASTER Our work yours and mine is not trivial at
present

MUSIC MASTER This is true Weve found here such a man as we both
need This is a nice source of income for usthis Monsieur
Jourdain with the visions of nobility and gallantry that he has
gotten into his head You and I should hope that everyone resembled
him

DANCING MASTER Not entirely I could wish that he understood
better the things that we give him

MUSIC MASTER Its true that he understands them poorly but he
pays well and thats what our art needs now more than anything
else

DANCING MASTER As for me I admit I feed a little on glory
Applause touches me and I hold that in all the fine arts it is
painful to produce for dolts to endure the barbarous opinions of a
fool about my choreography It is a pleasure dont tell me
otherwise to work for people who can appreciate the fine points of
an art who know how to give a sweet reception to the beauties of a
work and by pleasurable approbations gratify us for our labor
Yes the most agreeable recompense we can receive for the things we
do is to see them recognized and flattered by an applause that
honors us There is nothing in my opinion that pays us better for
all our fatigue and it is an exquisite delight to receive the
praises of the wellinformed

MUSIC MASTER I agree and I enjoy them as you do There is surely
nothing more agreeable than the applause you speak of but that
incense does not provide a living Pure praises do not provide a
comfortable existence it is necessary to add something solid and
the best way to praise is to praise with cashinhand Hes a man
its true whose insight is very slight who talks nonsense about
everything and applauds only for the wrong reasons but his money
makes up for his judgments He has discernment in his purse His
praises are in cash and this ignorant bourgeois is worth more to
us as you see than the educated nobleman who introduced us here

DANCING MASTER There is some truth in what you say but I find
that you lean a little too heavily on money and material interest
is something so base that a man of good taste should never show an
attachment to it

MUSIC MASTER You are ready enough to receive the money our man
gives you

DANCING MASTER Assuredly but I dont place all my happiness in
it and I could wish that together with his fortune he had some
good taste in things

MUSIC MASTER I could wish it too thats what both of us are
working for as much as we can But in any case he gives us the
means to make ourselves known in the world and he will pay others
if they will praise him

DANCING MASTER Here he comes

SCENE II Monsieur Jourdain Two Lackeys Music Master Dancing
Master Pupil Musicians and Dancers

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Well gentlemen Whats this Are you going to
show me your little skit

DANCING MASTER How What little skit

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Well the Whatdoyoucall it Your
prologue or dialogue of songs and dances

DANCING MASTER Ha ha

MUSIC MASTER You find us ready for you

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I kept you waiting a little but its because
Im having myself dressed today like the people of quality and my
tailor sent me some silk stockings that I thought I would never get
on

MUSIC MASTER We are here only to wait upon your leisure

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I want you both to stay until they have brought
me my suit so that you may see me

DANCING MASTER Whatever you would like

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN You will see me fitted out properly from head
to foot

MUSIC MASTER We have no doubt of it

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I had this robe made for me

DANCING MASTER Its very attractive

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN My tailor told me the people of quality dress
like this in the mornings

MUSIC MASTER Its marvelously becoming

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Hey lackeys My two lackeys

FIRST LACKEY What do you wish Sir

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Nothing I just wanted to see if you were paying
attention To the two masters What say you of my liveries

DANCING MASTER Theyre magnificent

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Half opening his gown showing a pair of tight
red velvet breeches and a green velvet vest that he is wearing
Here again is a sort of lounging dress to perform my morning
exercises in

MUSIC MASTER It is elegant

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Lackey

FIRST LACKEY Sir

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN The other lackey

SECOND LACKEY Sir

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Hold my robe To the Masters Do you think I
look good

DANCING MASTER Very well No one could look better

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Now lets have a look at your little show
MUSIC MASTER I would like very much for you to listen to a melody
he indicating his student has just composed for the serenade that
you ordered from me Hes one of my pupils who has an admirable
talent for these kinds of things

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes but you should not have had that done by a
pupil you yourself were none too good for that piece of work

MUSIC MASTER You must not let the name of pupil fool you sir
Pupils of this sort know as much as the greatest masters and the
melody is as fine as could be made Just listen

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN To Lackeys Give me my robe so I can listen
better Wait I believe I would be better without a robe
No give it back that will be better

MUSICIAN Singing I languish night and day my suffering is
extreme Since to your control your lovely eyes subjected me If you
thus treat fair Iris those you love Alas how would you treat an
enemy

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN This song seems to me a little mournful it
lulls to sleep and I would like it if you could liven it up a
little here and there

MUSIC MASTER It is necessary Sir that the tune be suited to the
words

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Someone taught me a perfectly pretty one some
time ago Listen Now how does it go

DANCING MASTER By my faith I dont know

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN There are sheep in it

DANCING MASTER Sheep

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes Ah He sings I thought my Jeanneton As
beautiful as sweet I thought my Jeanneton Far sweeter than a
sheep Alas Alas She is a hundred times A thousand times more
cruel Than tigers in the woods Isnt it pretty

MUSIC MASTER The prettiest in the world

DANCING MASTER And you sing it well

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Its without having learned music

MUSIC MASTER You ought to learn it Sir as you are learning
dancing They are two arts which have a close connection

DANCING MASTER And which open the mind of a man to fine things

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN And do people of quality learn music too

MUSIC MASTER Yes sir

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Ill learn it then But I dont know when I can
find time for besides the Fencing Master whos teaching me I have
also engaged a master of philosophy who is to begin this morning

MUSIC MASTER Philosophy is something but music sir music

DANCING MASTER Music and dancing music and dancing thats all
thats necessary

MUSIC MASTER Theres nothing so useful in a State as music

DANCING MASTER Theres nothing so necessary to men as dancing

MUSIC MASTER Without music a State cannot subsist

DANCING MASTER Without the dance a man can do nothing

MUSIC MASTER All the disorders all the wars one sees in the world
happen only from not learning music

DANCING MASTER All the misfortunes of mankind all the dreadful
disasters that fill the history books the blunders of politicians
and the faults of omission of great commanders all this comes from
not knowing how to dance

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN How is that

MUSIC MASTER Does not war result from a lack of agreement between
men

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN That is true

MUSIC MASTER And if all men learned music wouldnt that be a
means of bringing about harmony and of seeing universal peace in
the world

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN You are right

DANCING MASTER When a man has committed a mistake in his conduct
in family affairs or in affairs of government of a state or in
the command of an army do we not always say He took a bad step
in such and such an affair

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes thats said

DANCING MASTER And can taking a bad step result from anything but
not knowing how to dance

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Its true you are both right

DANCING MASTER It makes you see the excellence and usefulness of
music and the dance

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I understand that now

MUSIC MASTER Do you wish to see our pieces

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes

MUSIC MASTER I have already told you that this is a little attempt
I have made to show the different passions that music can express

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Very good

MUSIC MASTER To musicians Here come forward To Monsieur
Jourdain You must imagine that they are dressed as shepherds

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Why always as shepherds You see nothing but
that everywhere

MUSIC MASTER When we have characters that are to speak in music
its necessary for believability to make them pastoral Singing
has always been assigned to shepherds and it is scarcely natural
dialogue for princes or merchants to sing their passions

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Alright alright Lets see

DIALOGUE IN MUSIC A Woman and Two Men

ALL THREE A heart under the domination of love Is always with a
thousand cares oppressed It is said that we gladly languish
gladly sigh But despite what can be said There is nothing so
sweet as our liberty

FIRST MAN There is nothing so sweet as the loving fires That make
two hearts beat as one One cannot live without amorous desires
Take love from life you take away the pleasures

SECOND MAN It would be sweet to submit to loves rule If one
could find faithful love But alas oh cruel rule No faithful
shepherdess is to be seen And that inconstant sex much too
unworthy Must renounce love eternally

FIRST MAN Pleasing ardor

WOMAN Happy liberty

SECOND MAN Deceitful woman

FIRST MAN How precious you are to me

WOMAN How you please my heart

SECOND MAN How horrible you are to me

FIRST MAN Ah leave for love that mortal hate

WOMAN We can we can show you a faithful shepherdess

SECOND MAN Alas Where to find her

WOMAN In order to defend our reputation I want to offer you my
heart

FIRST MAN But shepherdess can I believe That it will not be
deceitful

WOMAN Well see through experience Who of the two loves best

SECOND MAN Who lacks constancy May the gods destroy

ALL THREE With ardors so beautiful Let us be inflamed Ah how
sweet it is to love When two hearts are faithful

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Is that all

MUSIC MASTER Yes

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I find it welldone and there are some pretty
enough sayings in it

DANCING MASTER Here for my presentation is a little display of
the loveliest movements and the most beautiful attitudes with which
a dance can possibly be varied

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Are these shepherds too

DANCING MASTER Theyre whatever you please Lets go Four
dancers execute all the different movements and all the kinds of
steps that the Dancing Master commands and this dance makes the
First Interlude




ACT TWO

SCENE I Monsieur Jourdain Music Master Dancing Master Lackeys

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Thats not all that bad and those people there
hop around well

MUSIC MASTER When the dance is combined with the music it will
have even better effect and you will see something quite good in
the little ballet we have prepared for you

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Thats for later when the person I ordered all
this for is to do me the honor of coming here to dine

DANCING MASTER Everything is ready

MUSIC MASTER However sir this is not enough A person like you
who lives magnificently and who are inclined towards fine things
should have a concert of music here every Wednesday or every
Thursday

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Is that what people of quality do

MUSIC MASTER Yes Sir

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Then Ill have them Will it be fine

MUSIC MASTER Without doubt You must have three voicesa tenor
a soprano and a bass who will be accompanied by a bassviol a
theorbo and a clavecin for the chords with two violins to play
the ritournelles

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN You must also add a trumpet marine The trumpet
marine is an instrument that pleases me and its harmonious

MUSIC MASTER Leave it to us to manage things

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN At least dont forget to send the musicians to
sing at table

MUSIC MASTER You will have everything you should have

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN But above all let the ballet be fine

MUSIC MASTER You will be pleased with it and among other things
with certain minuets you will find in it

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Ah Minuets are my dance and I would like you
to see me dance them Come my Dancing Master

DANCING MASTER A hat sir if you please La la la la La la
la la In cadence please La la la la Your right leg La la
la la Dont move your shoulders so La la la la Your arms are
wrong La la la la Raise your head Turn the toe out La la
la la Straighten your body up

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN How was that Breathlessly

MUSIC MASTER The best

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN By the way teach me how to bow to salute a
marchioness I shall need to know soon

DANCING MASTER How you must bow to salute a marchioness

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes a marchioness named Dorimene

DANCING MASTER Give me your hand

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN No You only have to do it Ill remember it
well

DANCING MASTER If you want to salute her with a great deal of
respect you must first bow and step back then bow three times as
you walk towards her and at the last one bow down to her knees

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN After the Dancing Master has illustrated Do it
some Good

LACKEY Sir your Fencing Master is here MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Tell
him to come in here for my lesson I want you to see me perform

SCENE II Fencing Master Music Master Dancing Master Monsier
Jourdain a Lackey

FENCING MASTER After giving a foil to Monsieur Jourdain Come
sir the salute Your body straight A little inclined upon the
left thigh Your legs not so wide apart Your feet both in a line
Your wrist opposite your hip The point of your sword even with
your shoulder The arm not so much extended The left hand at the
level of the eye The left shoulder more squared The head up The
expression bold Advance The body steady Beat carte and thrust
One two Recover Again with the foot firm Leap back When you
make a pass Sir you must first disengage and your body must be
well turned One two Come beat tierce and thrust Advance Stop
there One two Recover Repeat Leap back On guard Sir on
guard The fencing master touches him two or three times with the
foil while saying On guard 

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN How was that Breathlessly

MUSIC MASTER You did marvelously

FENCING MASTER As I have told you the entire secret of fencing
lies in two things to give and not to receive and as I
demonstrated to you the other day it is impossible for you to
receive if you know how to turn your opponents sword from the
line of your body This depends solely on a slight movement of the
wrist either inward or outward

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN In this way then a man without courage is
sure to kill his man and not be killed himself

FENCING MASTER Without doubt Didnt you see the demonstration

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes

FENCING MASTER And thus you have seen how men like me should be
considered by the State and how the science of fencing is more
important than all the other useless sciences such as dancing
music

DANCING MASTER Careful there Monsieur swordsman Speak of the
dance only with respect

MUSIC MASTER I beg you to speak better of the excellence of
music

FENCING MASTER You are amusing fellows to want to compare your
sciences with mine

MUSIC MASTER See the selfimportance of the man

FENCING MASTER My little Dancing Master Ill make you dance as
you ought And you my little musician Ill make you sing in a
pretty way

DANCING MASTER Monsieur Clangerofiron Ill teach you your
trade

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN To the Dancing Master Are you crazy to quarrel
with him who knows tierce and quarte and who can kill a man by
demonstration

DANCING MASTER I disdain his demonstrations and his tierce and
his quarte

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Careful I tell you

FENCING MASTER What You little impertinent

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Oh My Fencing Master

DANCING MASTER What You big workhorse

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Oh My Dancing Master

FENCING MASTER If I throw myself on you

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Careful

DANCING MASTER If I get my hands on you

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Be nice

FENCING MASTER Ill go over you with a currycomb in such a
way

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Mercy

DANCING MASTER Ill give you a beating such as

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I beg of you

MUSIC MASTER Let us teach him a little how to talk

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Oh Lord Stop


SCENE III Philosophy Master Music Master Dancing Master Fencing
Master Monsieur Jourdain Lackeys

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Aha Monsieur Philosopher you come just in time
with your philosophy Come make a little peace among these
people

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Whats happening Whats the matter gentlemen

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN They have got into a rage over the superiority
of their professions to the point of injurious words and of wanting
to come to blows

PHILOSOPHY MASTER What Gentlemen must you act this way Havent
you read the learned treatise that Seneca composed on anger Is
there anything more base and more shameful than this passion which
turns a man into a savage beast And shouldnt reason be the
mistress of all our activities

DANCING MASTER Well Sir he has just abused both of us by
despising the dance which I practice and music which is his
profession

PHILOSOPHY MASTER A wise man is above all the insults that can be
spoken to him and the grand reply one should make to such outrages
is moderation and patience

FENCING MASTER They both had the audacity of trying to compare
their professions with mine

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Should that disturb you Men should not dispute
amongst themselves about vainglory and rank that which perfectly
distinguishes one from the other is wisdom and virtue

DANCING MASTER I insist to him that dance is a science to which
one cannot do enough honor

MUSIC MASTER And I that music is something that all the ages have
revered

FENCING MASTER And I insist to them that the science of fencing is
the finest and the most necessary of all sciences

PHILOSOPHY MASTER And where then will philosophy be I find you
all very impertinent to speak with this arrogance in front of me
and impudently to give the name of science to things that one
should not even honor with the name of art and that cannot be
classified except under the name of miserable gladiator singer
and buffoon

FENCING MASTER Get out you dog of a philosopher

MUSIC MASTER Get out you worthless pedant

DANCING MASTER Get out you illmannered cur

PHILOSOPHY MASTER What Rascals that you are The philosopher
flings himself at them and all three go out fighting

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Monsieur Philosopher

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Rogues Scoundrels Insolent dogs

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Monsieur Philosopher

FENCING MASTER A pox on the beast

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Gentlemen

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Impudent rogues

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Monsieur Philosopher

DANCING MASTER The devil take the jackass

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Gentlemen

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Villains

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Monsieur Philosopher

MUSIC MASTER To the devil with the impertinent fellow

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Gentlemen

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Rascals Beggars Traitors Impostors They
leave

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Monsieur Philosopher Gentlemen Monsieur
Philosopher Gentlemen Monsieur Philosopher Oh Fight as much as
you like I dont know what to do and Ill not spoil my robe to
separate you I would be a fool to go among them and receive some
damaging blow




ACT TWO

SCENE IV Philosophy Master Monsieur Jourdain

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Straightening the collar that indicates he is a
Philosopher Now to our lesson

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Oh Sir I am distressed by the blows they gave
you

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Its nothing A philosopher knows how to take
these things and Ill compose a satire against them in the style
of Juvenal which will fix them nicely Let it be What would you
like to learn

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Everything I can for I have every desire in the
world to be educated and Im furious that my father and mother did
not make me study all the sciences when I was young

PHILOSOPHY MASTER This is a reasonable sentiment Nam sine
doctrina vita est quasi mortis imago You understand that and you
doubtless know Latin

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes but act as if I did not know it Tell me
what it says

PHILOSOPHY MASTER It says that without science life is almost an
image of death

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN That Latin is right

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Dont you know some principles some basics of
the sciences

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Oh yes I can read and write

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Where would it please you for us to begin Would
you like me to teach you logic

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN What is this logic

PHILOSOPHY MASTER It is that which teaches the three operations of
the mind

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN What are these three operations of the mind

PHILOSOPHY MASTER The first the second and the third The first
is to conceive well by means of the universals the second is to
judge well by means of the categories and the third is to draw
well a conclusion by means of figures Barbara Celarent Darii
Ferio Baralipton etc

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Those words are too ugly This logic doesnt
suit me at all Lets learn something else thats prettier

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Would you like to learn morality

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Morality

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Yes

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN What does it say this morality

PHILOSOPHY MASTER It treats of happiness teaches men to moderate
their passions and

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN No lets leave that Im as choleric as all the
devils and theres no morality that sticks I want to be as full of
anger as I want whenever I like

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Would you like to learn physics

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Whats it about this physics

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Physics explains the principles of natural
things and the properties of the material world it discourses on
the nature of the elements of metals minerals of stones of
plants and animals and teaches the causes of all the meteors the
rainbow the will o the wisps the comets lightning thunder
thunderbolts rain snow hail winds and whirlwinds

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Theres too much commotion in it too much
confusion

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Then what do you want me to teach you

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Teach me how to spell

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Very gladly

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Afterwards you may teach me the almanack to
know when there is a moon and when not

PHILOSOPHY MASTER So be it Following your thought and treating
this matter as a philosopher it is necessary to begin according to
the order of things by an exact knowledge of the nature of letters
and the different ways of pronouncing them all And thereupon I
must tell you letters are divided into vowels called vowels
because they express the voice and into consonants because they
sound with the vowels and only mark the diverse articulations of
the voice There are five vowels or voices A E I O U

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I understand all that

PHILOSOPHY MASTER The vowel A is formed by opening the mouth
widely A Its vowels are to be given the sounds used in
vocalizing Ahayeeeoou

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN A A Yes

PHILOSOPHY MASTER The vowel E is formed by approaching the lower
jaw to the upper A E

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN A E A E By my faith yes Ah How fine
PHILOSOPHY MASTER And the vowel I by bringing the jaws still
nearer each other and stretching the two corners of the mouth
towards the ears A E I

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN A E I I I I Thats true Long live
science

PHILOSOPHY MASTER The vowel O is formed by opening the jaws and
drawing together the two corners of the lips upper and lower O

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN O O Theres nothing truer A E I OI O
Thats admirable I O I O

PHILOSOPHY MASTER The opening of the mouth happens to make a
little circle which represents an O

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN O O O You are right O Ah What a fine thing
it is to know something

PHILOSOPHY MASTER The vowel U is formed by bringing the teeth
nearly together without completely joining them and thrusting the
two lips outward also bringing them nearly together without
completely joining them U

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN U U Theres nothing truer U

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Your two lips thrust out as if you were making a
face whence it results that if you want to make a face at someone
and mock him you have only to say to him U

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN U U Thats true Ah Why didnt I study sooner
in order to know all that

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Tomorrow we shall look at the other letters
which are the consonants

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Are there things as curious about them as about
these

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Without a doubt The consonant D for example
is pronounced by clapping the tongue above the upper teeth D

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN D D Yes Ah What fine things Fine things

PHILOSOPHY MASTER The F by pressing the upper teeth against the
lower lip F

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN F F Thats the truth Ah My father and my
mother how I wish you ill

PHILOSOPHY MASTER And the R by carrying the tip of the tongue to
the top of the palate so that being grazed by the air that comes
out with force it yields to it and comes back always to the same
place making a kind of trill R AR

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN R R AR R R R R R RA Thats true Ah
What a clever man you are And how I have lost time R R R AR

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Ill explain to you all these strange things to
their very depths

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Please do But now I must confide in you Im
in love with a lady of great quality and I wish that you would
help me write something to her in a little note that I will let
fall at her feet

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Very well

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN That will be gallant yes

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Without doubt Is it verse that you wish to
write her

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN No no No verse

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Do you want only prose

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN No I dont want either prose or verse

PHILOSOPHY MASTER It must be one or the other

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Why

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Because sir there is no other way to express
oneself than with prose or verse

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN There is nothing but prose or verse

PHILOSOPHY MASTER No sir everything that is not prose is verse
and everything that is not verse is prose

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN And when one speaks what is that then

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Prose

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN What When I say Nicole bring me my slippers
and give me my nightcap thats prose

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Yes Sir

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN By my faith For more than forty years I have
been speaking prose without knowing anything about it and I am
much obliged to you for having taught me that I would like then to
put into a note to her Beautiful marchioness your lovely eyes
make me die of love but I want that put in a gallant manner and
be nicely turned

PHILOSOPHY MASTER Put it that the fires of her eyes reduce your
heart to cinders that you suffer night and day for her the
torments of a

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN No no no I want none of that I only want you
to say Beautiful marchioness your lovely eyes make me die of
love

PHILOSOPHY MASTER The thing requires a little lengthening

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN No I tell you I want only those words in the
note but turned stylishly well arranged as is necessary Please
tell me just to see the diverse ways they could be put

PHILOSOPHY MASTER One could put them first of all as you said
them Beautiful marchioness your lovely eyes make me die of
love Or else Of love to die make me beautiful marchioness
your beautiful eyes Or else Your lovely eyes of love make me
beautiful marchioness die Or else Die your lovely eyes
beautiful marchioness of love make me Or else Me make your
lovely eyes die beautiful marchioness of love

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN But of all those ways which is the best

PHILOSOPHY MASTER The way you said it Beautiful marchioness
your lovely eyes make me die of love

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I never studied and yet I made the whole thing
up at the first try I thank you with all my heart and I ask you
to come tomorrow early

PHILOSOPHY MASTER I shall not fail to do so He leaves

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN What Hasnt my suit come yet

THE LACKEY No Sir

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN That cursed tailor makes me wait all day when I
have so much to do Im enraged May the quartan fever shake that
tormentor of a tailor To the devil with the tailor May the plague
choke the tailor If I had him here now that detestable tailor
that dog of a tailor that traitor of a tailor I




ACT TWO

SCENE V Master Tailor Apprentice Tailor carrying suit Monsieur
Jourdain Lackeys

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Ah Youre here I was getting into a rage
against you

MASTER TAILOR I could not come sooner and I put twenty men to
work on your suit

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN You sent me some silk hose so small that I had
all the difficulty in the world putting them on and already there
are two broken stitches

MASTER TAILOR They get bigger too much so

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes if I always break the stitches You also
had made for me a pair of shoes that pinch furiously

MASTER TAILOR Not at all sir

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN How not at all

MASTER TAILOR No they dont pinch you at all

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I tell you they pinch me

MASTER TAILOR You imagine that

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I imagine it because I feel it Thats a good
reason for you

MASTER TAILOR Wait here is the finest courtsuit and the best
matched Its a masterpiece to have invented a serious suit that is
not black And I give six attempts to the best tailors to equal
it

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Whats this Youve put the flowers upside
down

MASTER TAILOR You didnt tell me you wanted them right side up

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Did I have to tell you that

MASTER TAILOR Yes surely All the people of quality wear them
this way

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN The people of quality wear the flowers upside
down

MASTER TAILOR Yes Sir

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Oh Its alright then

MASTER TAILOR If you like Ill put them right side up

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN No no

MASTER TAILOR You have only to say so

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN No I tell you Youve made it very well Do you
think the suit is going to look good on me

MASTER TAILOR What a question I defy a painter with his brush to
do anything that would fit you better I have a worker in my place
who is the greatest genius in the world at mounting a rhinegrave
and another who is the hero of the age at assembling a doublet

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN The perruque and the plumes are they correct

MASTER TAILOR Everythings good

ACT THREE

SCENE III Madame Jourdain Monsieur Jourdain Nicole Lackeys

MADAME JOURDAIN Ah ah Heres a new story Whats this whats
this husband this outfit you have on there Dont you care what
people think of you when you are got up like that And do you want
yourself laughed at everywhere

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN None but fools and dolts will laugh at me wife

MADAME JOURDAIN Truly they havent waited until now your antics
have long given a laugh to everyone

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Whos everyone if you please

MADAME JOURDAIN Everyone is everyone who is right and who is wiser
than you For my part I am scandalized at the life you lead I no
longer recognize our house One would say its the beginning of
Carnival here every day and beginning early in the morning so it
wont be forgotten one hears nothing but the racket of fiddles and
singers which disturbs the whole neighborhood

NICOLE Madame speaks well Ill never be able to get my housework
done properly with that gang you have come here They have feet
that hunt for mud in every part of town to bring it here and poor
Franoise almost has her teeth on the floor scrubbing the boards
that your fine masters come to dirty up every day

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN What our servant Nicole you have quite a
tongue for a peasant

MADAME JOURDAIN Nicole is right and she has more sense than you
Id like to know what you think youre going to do with a Dancing
Master at your age

NICOLE And with a hulking Fencing Master who comes stamping his
feet shaking the whole house and tearing up all the floorboards in
our drawingroom

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Be quiet both servant and wife

MADAME JOURDAIN Is it that youre learning to dance for the time
when youll have no legs to dance on

NICOLE Do you want to kill someone

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Quiet I tell you You are ignorant women both
of you and you dont know the advantages of all this

MADAME JOURDAIN You should instead be thinking of marrying off
your daughter who is of an age to be provided for

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Ill think of marrying off my daughter when a
suitable match comes along but I also want to learn about fine
things

NICOLE I heard said Madame that today he took a Philosophy
Master to thicken the soup

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Very well I have a wish to have wit and to
reason about things with decent people

MADAME JOURDAIN Dont you intend one of these days to go to
school and have yourself whipped at your age

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Why not Would to God I were whipped this minute
in front of everyone if I only knew what they learn at school

NICOLE Yes my faith That would get you into better shape

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Without doubt

MADAME JOURDAIN All this is very important to the management of
your house

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Assuredly You both talk like beasts and Im
ashamed of your ignorance For example do you know what are you
speaking just now

MADAME JOURDAIN Yes I know that what Im saying is well said and
that you ought to be considering living in another way

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Im not talking about that Im asking if you
know what the words are that you are saying here

MADAME JOURDAIN They are words that are very sensible and your
conduct is scarcely so

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Im not talking about that I tell you Im
asking you what is it that Im speaking to you this minute what
is it

MADAME JOURDAIN Nonsense

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN No no Thats not it What is it we are both
saying what language is it that we are speaking right now

MADAME JOURDAIN Well

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN What is it called

MADAME JOURDAIN Its called whatever you want

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Its prose you ignorant creature

MADAME JOURDAIN Prose

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes prose Everything is prose that is not
verse and everything thats not verse is prose There This is
what it is to study And you to Nicole do you know what you must
do to say U

NICOLE What

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Say U in order to see

NICOLE Oh Well U

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN What do you do

NICOLE I say U

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes but when you say U what do you do

NICOLE I do what you tell me to

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Oh how strange it is to have to deal with
morons You thrust your lips out and bring your lower jaw to your
upper jaw U see U Do you see I make a pout U

NICOLE Yes thats beautiful

MADAME JOURDAIN How admirable

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN But its quite another thing if you have seen
O and D D and F F

MADAME JOURDAIN What is all this rigmarole

NICOLE What does all this do for us

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN It enrages me when I see these ignorant women

MADAME JOURDAIN Go go you ought to send all those people packing
with their foolishness

NICOLE And above all that great gawk of a Fencing Master who
ruins all my work with dust

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Well This Fencing Master seems to get under
your skin Ill soon show you how impertinent you areHe has the
foils brought and gives one to Nicole There Demonstration The
line of the body When your opponent thrusts in quarte you need
only do this and when they thrust in tierce you need only do
this That is the way never to be killed and isnt it fine to be
assured of what one does when fighting against someone There
thrust at me a little to see

NICOLE Well then what Nicole thrusts giving him several
hits

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Easy Wait Oh Gently Devil take the hussy

NICOLE You told me to thrust

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes but you thrust in tierce before you thrust
in quarte and you didnt have the patience to let me parry

MADAME JOURDAIN You are a fool husband with all your fantasies
and this has come to you since you took a notion to associate with
the nobility

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN When I associate with the nobility I show my
good judgment and thats better than associating with your
shopkeepers

MADAME JOURDAIN Oh yes truly Theres a great deal to gain by
consorting with your nobles and you did so well with your fine
Count you were so taken with

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Peace Think what youre saying You know very
well wife that you dont know who youre talking about when you
talk about him Hes a more important person than you think a
great Lord respected at court and who talks to the King just as I
talk to you Is it not a thing which does me great honor that a
person of this quality is seen to come so often to my house who
calls me his dear friend and treats me as if I were his equal He
has more regard for me than one would ever imagine and in front
of everyone he shows me so much affection that I am embarrassed
myself

MADAME JOURDAIN Yes he has a kindness for you and shows his
affection but he borrows your money

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN So Isnt it an honor for me to lend money to a
man of that condition And can I do less for a lord who calls me
his dear friend

MADAME JOURDAIN And this lord what does he do for you

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Things that would astonish you if you knew
them

MADAME JOURDAIN Like what

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Blast I cannot explain myself It must suffice
that if I have lent him money hell pay it back fully and before
long

MADAME JOURDAIN Yes You are waiting for that

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Assuredly Didnt he tell me so

MADAME JOURDAIN Yes yes he wont fail to do it

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN He swore it on the faith of a gentleman

MADAME JOURDAIN Nonsense

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Well You are very obstinate wife I tell you
he will keep his word Im sure of it

MADAME JOURDAIN And Im sure he will not and that all his show of
affection is only to flatter you

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Be still Here he is

MADAME JOURDAIN Thats all we needed Hes come again perhaps to
borrow something from you The very sight of him spoils my
appetite

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Be still I tell you

DORANTE The sum total is exact fifteen thousand eight hundred
livres To which add two hundred pistoles that you are going to
give me which will make exactly eighteen thousand francs which I
shall pay you at the first opportunity

MADAME JOURDAIN Aside Well didnt I predict it

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Peace

DORANTE Will that inconvenience you to give me the amount I say

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Oh no

MADAME JOURDAIN Aside That man is making a milkcow out of you

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Be quiet

DORANTE If that inconveniences you I will seek it somewhere
else

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN NO Sir

MADAME JOURDAIN Aside He wont be content until hes ruined

admirers in your youth beautiful and good humored as you were

MADAME JOURDAIN By Our Lady Sir is Madame Jourdain decrepit and
does her head already shake with palsy

DORANTE Ah My faith Madame Jourdain I beg pardon I did not

impertinence


ACT THREE

SCENE VI Monsieur Jourdain Madame Jourdain Dorante Nicole
MONSIEUR JOURDAIN There are two hundred louis dor DORANTE I
assure you Monsieur Jourdain that I am completely yours and that
I am eager to render you a service at court MONSIEUR JOURDAIN
Im much obliged to you DORANTE If Madame Jourdain desires to
see the royal entertainment I will have the best places in the
ballroom given to her MADAME JOURDAIN Madame Jourdain kisses
your hands but declines DORANTE Aside to Monsieur Jourdain
Our beautiful marchioness as I sent word to you in my note will
come here soon for the ballet and refreshments I finally brought
her to consent to the entertainment you wish to give her MONSIEUR
JOURDAIN Let us move a little farther away for a certain reason
DORANTE It has been eight days since I saw you and I have sent
you no news regarding the diamond you put into my hands to present
to her on your behalf but its because I had the greatest
difficulty in conquering her scruples and its only today that she
resolved to accept it

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN How did she judge it

DORANTE Marvelous And I am greatly deceived if the beauty of that
diamond does not produce for you an admirable effect on her
spirit

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Would to Heaven

MADAME JOURDAIN To Nicole Once hes with him he cannot leave
him

DORANTE I made her value as she should the richness of that
present and the grandeur of your love

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN These are sir favors which overwhelm me and I
am in the very greatest confusion at seeing a person of your
quality demean himself for me as you do

DORANTE Are you joking Among friends does one stop at these
sorts of scruples And wouldnt you do the same thing for me if
the occasion offered

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Oh Certainly and with all my heart

MADAME JOURDAIN To Nicole His presence weighs me down

DORANTE As for me I never mind anything when it is necessary to
serve a friend and when you confided in me about the ardent
passion you have formed for that delightful marchioness with whom I
have contacts you saw that I volunteered immediately to assist
your love

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Its true these are favors that confound me

MADAME JOURDAIN To Nicole Will he never go

NICOLE They enjoy being together

DORANTE You took the right tack to touch her heart Women love
above all the expenses we go to for them and your frequent
serenades your continual bouquets that superb fireworks for her
over the water the diamond she has received from you and the
entertainment you are preparing for her all this speaks much
better in favor of your love than all the words you might have
spoken yourself

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN There are no expenditures I would not make if by
that means I might find the road to her heart A woman of quality
has ravishing charms for me and its an honor I would purchase at
any price

MADAME JOURDAIN To Nicole What can they talk about so much
Steal over and listen a little

DORANTE Soon enough you will enjoy at your ease the pleasure of
seeing her and your eyes will have a long time to satisfy
themselves

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN To be completely free I have arranged for my
wife to go to dinner at her sisters where shell spend all the
afterdinner hours

DORANTE You have done prudently as your wife might have
embarrassed us I have given the necessary orders to the cook for
you and for the ballet It is of my own invention and provided
the execution corresponds to the idea I am sure it will be
found

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Sees that Nicole is listening and gives her a
slap Say Youre very impertinent To Dorante Lets go if you
please


ACT THREE

SCENE VII Madame Jourdain Nicole

NICOLE My faith Madame curiosity has cost me but I believe
somethings afoot since they were talking of some event where they
did not want you to be

MADAME JOURDAIN Todays not the first time Nicole that Ive had
suspicions about my husband Im the most mistaken woman in the
world or theres some loveaffair in the making But let us see to
my daughter You know the love Cleonte has for her Hes a man who
appeals to me and I want to help his suit and give him Lucile if
I can

NICOLE Truly Madame Im the most delighted creature in the world
to see that you feel this way since if the master appeals to you
his valet appeals to me no less and I could wish our marriage made
under the shadow of theirs

MADAME JOURDAIN Go speak to Cleonte about it for me and tell him
to come to me soon so we can present his request to my husband for
my daughter in marriage

NICOLE I hasten Madame with joy for I could not receive a more
agreeable commission Alone I shall I think make them very
happy

treacherous words

CLEONTE Get out I tell you and go tell your faithless mistress
that she will never again in her life deceive the too trusting
Cleonte

NICOLE What caprice is this My dear Covielle explain a little
what you are trying to say

COVIELLE Your dear Covielle little hussy Go quickly out of my
sight villainess and leave me in peace

NICOLE What You come to me too COVIELLE Out of my sight I
tell you and never speak to me again NICOLE My word What fly
has bitten those two Lets go tell this pretty story to my
mistress


ACT THREE

SCENE IX Cleonte Covielle

CLEONTE What Treat a lover in this way And a lover who is the
most faithful and passionate of lovers

COVIELLE It is a frightful thing that they have done to us both

CLEONTE I show a woman all the ardor and tenderness that can be
imagined I love nothing in the world but her and I have nothing
but her in my thoughts she is all I care for all my desire all
my joy I talk of nothing but her I think of nothing but her I
have no dreams but of her I breathe only because of her my heart
lives wholly in her and see how so much love is well repaid I
have been two days without seeing her which are for me two
frightful centuries I meet her by chance my heart at that sight
is completely transported my joy shines on my face I fly with
ecstasy towards herand the faithless one averts her eyes and
hurries by as if she had never seen me in her life

COVIELLE I say the same things as you

CLEONTE Covielle can one see anything to equal this perfidy of
the ungrateful Lucile

COVIELLE And that Monsieur of the treacherous Nicole

CLEONTE After so many ardent homages sighs and vows that I have
made to her charms

COVIELLE After so many assiduous compliments cares and services
that I rendered her in the kitchen

CLEONTE So many tears I have shed at her knees

COVIELLE So many buckets of water I have drawn for her

CLEONTE So much passion I have shown her in loving her more than
myself

COVIELLE So much heat I have endured in turning the spit for her

CLEONTE She flies from me in disdain

COVIELLE She turns her back on me

CLEONTE It is perfidy worthy of the greatest punishments

COVIELLE It is treachery that merits a thousand slaps

CLEONTE Dont think I beg you of ever speaking in her favor to
me

COVIELLE I sir God forbid

CLEONTE Never come to excuse the action of this faithless woman

COVIELLE Have no fear

CLEONTE No you see all your speeches in her defense will serve
no purpose

COVIELLE Who even thinks of that

CLEONTE I want to conserve my resentment against her and end all
contact with her

COVIELLE I agree

CLEONTE This Count who goes to her house is perhaps pleasant in
her view and her mind I well see allows itself to be dazzled by
social standing But it is necessary for me for my honor to
prevent the scandal of her inconstancy I want to break off with
her first and not leave her all the glory of dumping me COVIELLE
Thats very well said and I agree for my part with all your
feelings

CLEONTE Strengthen my resentment and aid my resolve against all
the remains of love that could speak in her behalf Tell me I
order you all the bad you can of her make for me a painting of
her that will render her despicable and show well in order to
disgust me all the faults that you can see in her

COVIELLE Her sir Theres a pretty fool a well made flirt for
you to give so much love I see only mediocrity in her and you
will find a hundred women who will be more worthy of you First of
all she has small eyes

CLEONTE Thats true she has small eyes but they are full of
fire the brightest the keenest in the world the most touching
eyes that one can see

COVIELLE She has a big mouth

CLEONTE Yes but upon it one sees grace that one never sees on
other mouths and the sight of that mouth which is the most
attractive the most amorous in the world inspires desire

COVIELLE As for her figure shes not tall

CLEONTE No but she is graceful and well made

COVIELLE She affects a nonchalance in her speech and in her
actions

CLEONTE Thats true but she may be forgiven all that for her
manners are so engaging they have an irresistible charm

COVIELLE As to her wit

CLEONTE Ah She has that Covielle the finest the most
delicate

COVIELLE Her conversation

CLEONTE Her conversation is charming

COVIELLE She is always serious

CLEONTE Would you have grinning playfulness constant open
merriment And do you see anything more impertinent than those
women who laugh all the time

COVIELLE But finally she is as capricious as any woman in the
world

CLEONTE Yes she is capricious I concede but everything becomes
beautiful ladies well one suffers everything for beauty

COVIELLE I see clearly how it goes you want to go on loving her

CLEONTE Me Id like better to die and I am going to hate her as
much as I loved her

COVIELLE How if you find her so perfect

CLEONTE Thats how my vengeance will be more striking in that way
Ill show better the strength of my heart by hating her by
quitting her with all her beauty all her charms and as lovable
as I find her Here she is

I want to be the first to break with you and you wont have the
advantage of driving me away I will have difficulty in conquering
the love I have for you it will cause me pain I will suffer for a
while But Ill come through it and I would rather stab myself
through the heart than have the weakness to return to you

all men are like devils we must flee

ACT THREE

SCENE XI Madame Jourdain Cleonte Lucile Covielle Nicole

MADAME JOURDAIN I am very glad to see you Cleonte and you are
here at just the right time My husband is coming seize the
opportunity to ask for Lucile in marriage

CLEONTE Ah Madame how sweet that word is to me and how it
flatters my desires Could I receive an order more charming a
favor more precious


ACT THREE

SCENE XII Monsieur Jourdain Madame Jourdain Cleonte Lucile
Covielle Nicole

CLEONTE Sir I did not want to use anyone to make a request of you
that I have long considered It affects me enough for me to take
charge of it myself and without further ado I will say to you
that the honor of being your soninlaw is a glorious favor that I
beg you to grant me

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Before giving you a reply sir I beg to ask if
you are a gentleman

CLEONTE Sir most people dont hesitate much over this question
They use the word carelessly They take the name without scruple
and the usage of today seems to validate the theft As for me I
confess to you I have a little more delicate feelings on this
matter I find all imposture undignified for an honest man and
that there is cowardice in disguising what Heaven made us at birth
to present ourselves to the eyes of the world with a stolen title
to wish to give a false impression I was born of parents who
without doubt held honorable positions I have six years of
service in the army and I find myself established well enough to
maintain a tolerable rank in the world but despite all that I
certainly have no wish to give myself a name to which others in my
place might believe they could pretend and I will tell you frankly
that I am not a gentleman

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Shake hands Sir My daughter is not for you

CLEONTE What

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN You are not a gentleman You will not have my
daughter

MADAME JOURDAIN What are you trying to say with your talk of
gentleman Are we ourselves of the line of St Louis

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Quiet wife I see what you are up to

MADAME JOURDAIN Arent we both descended from good bourgeois
families

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Theres that hateful word

MADAME JOURDAIN And wasnt your father a merchant just like mine

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Plague take the woman She never fails to do
this If your father was a merchant so much the worse for him
But as for mine those who say that are misinformed All that I
have to say to you is that I want a gentleman for a soninlaw

MADAME JOURDAIN Its necessary for your daughter to have a husband
who is worthy of her and its better for her to have an honest
rich man who is well made than an impoverished gentleman who is
badly built

NICOLE Thats true We have the son of a gentleman in our village
who is the most ill formed and the greatest fool I have ever seen

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Hold your impertinent tongue You always butt
into the conversation I have enough money for my daughter I need
only honor and I want to make her a marchioness

MADAME JOURDAIN A marchioness

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes marchioness

MADAME JOURDAIN Alas God save me from it

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Its a thing I have resolved

MADAME JOURDAIN As for me its a thing Ill never consent to
Marriages above ones station are always subject to great
inconveniences I have absolutely no wish for a soninlaw who can
reproach her parents to my daughter and I dont want her to have
children who will be ashamed to call me their grandmother If she
arrives to visit me in the equipage of a great lady and if she
fails by mischance to greet someone of the neighborhood they
wouldnt fail immediately to say a hundred stupidities Do you
see they would say this madam marchioness who gives herself
such glorious airs Its the daughter of Monsieur Jourdain who was
all too glad when she was little to play house with us shes not
always been so haughty as she now is and her two grandfathers sold
cloth near St Innocents Gate They amassed wealth for their
children theyre paying dearly perhaps for it now in the other
world and one can scarcely get that rich by being honest I
certainly dont want all that gossip and I want in a word a man
who will be obliged to me for my daughter and to whom I can say
Sit down there my soninlaw and have dinner with me

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Surely those are the sentiments of a little
spirit to want to remain always in a base condition Dont talk
back to me my daughter will be a marchioness in spite of
everyone And if you make me angrier Ill make a duchess of
her

MADAME JOURDAIN Cleonte dont lose courage yet Follow me my
daughter and tell your father resolutely that if you cant have
him you dont want to marry anyone


ACT THREE

SCENE XIII Cleonte Covielle

COVIELLE Youve made a fine business with your pretty
sentiments

CLEONTE What do you want I have a scruple about that which
precedent cannot conquer

COVIELLE Dont you make a fool of yourself by taking it seriously
with a man like that Dont you see that he is a fool And would it
cost you anything to accommodate yourself to his fantasies

CLEONTE Youre right But I didnt believe it necessary to prove
nobility in order to be Monsieur Jourdains soninlaw

COVIELLE Ha ha ha

CLEONTE What are you laughing at

COVIELLE At a thought that just occurred to me of how to play our
man a trick and help you obtain what you desire

CLEONTE How

COVIELLE The idea is really funny

CLEONTE What is it

COVIELLE A short time ago there was a certain masquerade which
fits here better than anything and that I intend to make part of a
prank I want to play on our fool It all seems a little phony but
with him one can try anything there is hardly any reason to be
subtle and he is the man to play his role marvelously and to
swallow easily any fabrication we want to tell him I have the
actors I have the costumes ready just leave it to me

CLEONTE But tell me

COVIELLE I am going to instruct you in everything Lets go there
he is returning


ACT THREE

SCENE XIV Monsieur Jourdain Lackey MONSIEUR JOURDAIN What the
devil is this They have nothing other than the great lords to
reproach me with and as for me I see nothing so fine as to
associate with the great lords there is only honor and civility
among them and I would have given two fingers of a hand to have
been born a count or a marquis LACKEY Sir heres the Count and
he has a lady with him MONSIEUR JOURDAIN What My Goodness I
have some orders to give Tell them Ill be back here soon

SCENE XV Dorimene Dorante Lackey

LACKEY Monsieur says that hell be here very soon

DORANTE Thats fine

DORIMENE I dont know Dorante I feel strange allowing you to
bring me to this house where I know no one

DORANTE Then where would you like Madame for me to express my
love with an entertainment since you will allow neither your house
nor mine for fear of scandal

DORIMENE But you dont mention that every day I am gradually
preparing myself to receive too great proofs of your passion As
good a defense as I have put up you wear down my resistance and
you have a polite persistence which makes me come gently to
whatever you like The frequent visits began declarations
followed after them came serenades and amusements in their train
and presents followed them I withstood all that but you dont
give up at all and step by step you are overcoming my resolve As
for me I can no longer answer for anything and I believe that in
the end you will bring me to marriage which I have so far
avoided

DORANTE My faith Madame you should already have come to it You
are a widow and you answer only to yourself I am my own master
and I love you more than my life Why shouldnt you be all my
happiness from today onward

DORIMENE Goodness Dorante for two people to live happily
together both of them need particular qualities and two of the
most reasonable persons in the world often have trouble making a
union satisfactory to them both

DORANTE Youre fooling yourself Madame to imagine so many
difficulties and the experience you had with one marriage doesnt
determine anything for others

DORIMENE Finally I always come back to this The expenses that I
see you go to for me disturb me for two reasons one is that they
get me more involved than I would like and the other is that I am
suremeaning no offensethat you cannot do this without
financially inconveniencing yourself and I certainly dont want
that

DORANTE Ah Madame they are trifles and it isnt by that

DORIMENE I know what Im talking about and among other gifts the
diamond you forced me to take is worth

DORANTE Oh Madame mercy dont put any value on a thing that my
love finds unworthy of you and allow Heres the master of the
house


ACT THREE

SCENE XVI Monsieur Jourdain Dorimene Dorante Lackey

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN After having made two bows finding himself too
near Dorimene A little farther Madame

DORIMENE What

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN One step if you please

DORIMENE What is it

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Step back a little for the third

DORANTE Madame Monsieur Jourdain is very knowledgeable

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Madame it is a very great honor to me to be
fortunate enough to be so happy as to have the joy that you should
have had the goodness to accord me the graciousness of doing me the
honor of honoring me with the favor of your presence and if I
also had the merit to merit a merit such as yours and if
Heaven envious of my luck should have accorded me the
advantage of seeing me worthy of the

DORANTE Monsieur Jourdain that is enough Madame doesnt like
grand compliments and she knows that you are a man of wit Aside
to Dorimene As you can see this good bourgeois is ridiculous
enough in all his manners

DORIMENE It isnt difficult to see it

DORANTE Madame he is the best of my friends

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN You do me too much honor

DORANTE A completely gallant man

DORIMENE I have great esteem for him

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I have done nothing yet Madame to merit this
favor

DORANTE Aside to Monsieur Jourdain Take care nonetheless to
say absolutely nothing to her about the diamond that you gave her

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Cant I even ask her how she likes it

DORANTE What Take care that you dont That would be loutish of
you and to act as a gallant man you must act as though it were
not you who made her this present Aloud Monsieur Jourdain
Madame says he is delighted to see you in his home

DORIMENE He honors me greatly

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN How obliged I am to you sir for speaking thus
to her for me

DORANTE I have had frightful trouble getting her to come here

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I dont know how to thank you enough

DORANTE He says Madame that he finds you the most beautiful
woman in the world

DORIMENE He does me a great favor

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Madame it is you who does the favors and

DORANTE Lets consider eating

LACKEY Everything is ready sir

DORANTE Come then let us sit at the table And bring on the
musicians

Six cooks who have prepared the feast dance together and make
the third interlude after which they carry in a table covered
with many dishes




ACT FOUR

SCENE I Dorimene Monsieur Jourdain Dorante two Male Musicians
a Female Musician Lackeys

DORIMENE Why Dorante that is really a magnificent repast

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN You jest Madame I wish it were worthy of being
offered to you All sit at the table

DORANTE Monsieur Jourdain is right Madame to speak so and he
obliges me by making you so welcome I agree with him that the
repast is not worthy of you Since it was I who ordered it and
since I do not have the accomplishments of our friends in this
matter you do not have here a very sophisticated meal and you
will find some incongruities in the combinations and some
barbarities of taste If Damis our friend had been involved
everything would have been according to the rules everything would
have been elegant and appropriate and he would not have failed to
impress upon you the significance of all the dishes of the repast
and to make you see his expertise when it comes to good food he
would have told you about hearthbaked bread with its golden brown
crust crunching tenderly between the teeth of a smooth
fullbodied wine fortified with a piquancy not too strong of a
loin of mutton improved with parsley of a cut of speciallyraised
veal as long as this white and delicate and which is like an
almond paste between the teeth of partridges complimented by a
surprisingly flavorful sauce and for his masterpiece a soup
accompanied by a fat young turkey surrounded by pigeons and crowned
with white onions mixed with chicory But as for me I declare my
ignorance and as Monsieur Jourdain has said so well I only wish
that the repast were more worthy of being offered to you

DORIMENE I reply to this compliment only by eating

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Ah What beautiful hands

DORIMENE The hands are mediocre Monsieur Jourdain but you wish
to speak of the diamond which is very beautiful

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Me Madame God forbid that I should wish to
speak of it that would not be acting gallantly and the diamond is
a very small thing

DORIMENE You are very particular

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN You are too kind

DORANTE Lets have some wine for Monsieur Jourdain and for these
gentlemen and ladies who are going to favor us with a drinking
song

DORIMENE It is marvelous to season good food by mixing it with
music and I see I am being admirably entertained

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Madame it isnt

DORANTE Monsieur Jourdain let us remain silent for these
gentlemen and ladies what they have for us to hear is of more
value than anything we could say The male singers and the woman
singer take the glasses sing two drinking songs and are
accompanied by all the instrumental ensemble


FIRST DRINKING SONG Drink a little Phyllis to start the glass
round Ah A glass in your hands is charmingly agreeable You and
the wine arm each other And I redouble my love for you both Let us
threewine you and meSwear my beauty to an eternal
passion Your lips are made yet more attractive by wetting with
wine Ah The one and the other inspire me with desire And both
you and it intoxicate me Let us threewine you and me
Swear my beauty to an eternal passion

SECOND DRINKING SONG Let us drink dear friends let us drink Time
that flies beckons us to it Let us profit from life as much as we
can Once we pass under the black shadow Goodbye to wine our
loves Let us drink while we can One cannot drink forever Let
fools speculate On the true happiness of life Our philosophy Puts
it among the winepots Possessions knowledge and glory Hardly
make us forget troubling cares And it is only with good drink That
one can be happy Come on then wine for all pour boys pour
Pour keep on pouring until they say Enough

DORIMENE I dont believe its possible to sing better and that is
positively beautiful

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I see something here Madame yet more
beautiful

DORIMENE Aha Monsieur Jourdain is more gallant than I thought

DORANTE What Madame what did you take Monsieur Jourdain for

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I would like for her to take me at my word

DORIMENE Again

DORANTE You dont know him

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN She may know me whenever it pleases her

DORIMENE Oh I am overwhelmed

DORANTE He is a man who is always ready with a repartee But dont
you see that Monsieur Jourdain Madame eats all the pieces of food
you have touched

DORIMENE I am captivated by Monsieur Jourdain

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN If I could captivate your heart I would be


ACT FOUR

SCENE II Madame Jourdain Monsieur Jourdain Dorimene Dorante
Musicians Lackeys

MADAME JOURDAIN Aha I find good company here and I see that I
was not expected Was it for this pretty affair Monsieur Husband
that you were so eager to send me to dinner at my sisters I just
saw stage decorations downstairs and here I see a banquet fit for
a wedding That is how you spend your money and this is how you
entertain the ladies in my absence and you give them music and
entertainment while sending me on my way

DORANTE What are you saying Madame Jourdain And what fantasies
are you getting into your head that your husband spends his money
and that it is he who is giving this entertainment to Madame
Please know that it is I that he only lends me his house and that
you ought to think more about the things you say

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Yes what impertinence It is the Count who
presents all this to Madame who is a person of quality He does me
the honor of using my house and of wishing me to be with him

MADAME JOURDAIN All thats nonsense I know what I know

DORANTE Come Madame Jourdain put on better glasses

MADAME JOURDAIN I dont need glasses sir I see well enough I
have had suspicions for a long time and Im not a fool This is
very low of you of a great lord to lend a hand as you do to the
follies of my husband And you Madame for a great lady it is
neither fine nor honest of you to cause dissension in a household
and to allow my husband to be in love with you

DORIMENE What is she trying to say with all this Goodness
Dorante You have outdone yourself by exposing me to the absurd
fantasies of this ridiculous woman

DORANTE Madame wait Madame where are you going

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Madame Monsieur Count make excuses to her and
try to bring her back Ah You impertinent creature this is a fine
way to act You come and insult me in front of everybody and you
drive from me people of quality

MADAME JOURDAIN I laugh at their quality

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I dont know who holds me back evil creature
from breaking your head with the remains of the repast you came to
disrupt The table is removed

MADAME JOURDAIN Leaving Im not concerned These are my rights
that I defend and Ill have all wives on my side

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN You do well to avoid my rage She arrived very
inopportunely I was in the mood to say pretty things and I had
never felt so witty Whats that


ACT FOUR

SCENE III Covielle disguised Monsieur Jourdain Lackey

COVIELLE Sir I dont know if I have the honor to be known to

COVIELLE Assuredly

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN And you knew him as a gentleman

COVIELLE Without doubt

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Then I dont know what is going on

COVIELLE What

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN There are some fools who want to tell me that he
was a tradesman

COVIELLE Him a tradesman Its pure slander he never was one
All that he did was to be very obliging very ready to help and
since he was a connoisseur in cloth he went all over to choose
them had them brought to his house and gave them to his friends
for money

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Im delighted to know you so you can testify to
the fact that my father was a gentleman

COVIELLE Ill attest to it before all the world

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Youll oblige me What business brings you
here

COVIELLE Since knowing your late father honorable gentleman as I
told you I have traveled through all the world

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Through all the world

COVIELLE Yes

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN I imagine its a long way from here to there

COVIELLE Assuredly I returned from all my long voyages only four
days ago and because of the interest I take in all that concerns
you I come to announce to you the best news in the world

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN What

COVIELLE You know that the son of the Grand Turk is here

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Me No

COVIELLE What He has a very magnificent retinue everybody goes
to see it and he has been received in this country as an important
lord

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN By my faith I didnt know that

COVIELLE The advantage to you in this is that he is in love with
your daughter

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN The son of the Grand Turk

COVIELLE Yes And he wants to be your soninlaw

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN My soninlaw the son of the Grand Turk

COVIELLE The son of the Grand Turk your soninlaw As I went to
see him and as I perfectly understand his language he conversed
with me and after some other discourse he said to me Acciam
croc soler ouch alla moustaph gidelum amanahem varahini oussere
carbulath that is to say Havent you seen a beautiful young
person who is the daughter of Monsieur Jourdain gentleman of
Paris

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN The son of the Grand Turk said that of me

COVIELLE Yes Inasmuch as I told him in reply that I knew you
particularly well and that I had seen your daughter Ah he said
to me marababa sahem Which is to say Ah how I am enamored of
her

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Marababa sahem means Ah how I am enamored of
her

COVIELLE Yes

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN By my faith you do well to tell me since as
for me I would never have believed that marababa sahem could
have meant to say Oh how I am enamored of her What an admirable
language Turkish is

COVIELLE More admirable than one can believe Do you know what
Cacaracamouchen means

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Cacaracamouchen No

COVIELLE It means It means My dear soul

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Cacaracamouchen means My dear soul

COVIELLE Yes

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Thats marvelous Cacaracamouchen my dear
soul Who would have thought Im dumbfounded

COVIELLE Finally to complete my assignment he comes to ask for
your daughter in marriage and in order to have a fatherinlaw who
should be worthy of him he wants to make you a Mamamouchi which
is a certain high rank in his country

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Mamamouchi

COVIELLE Yes Mamamouchi that is to say in our language a
Paladin Paladin is one of those ancient Well Paladin
There is none nobler than that in the world and you will be equal
to the greatest lords of the earth

Please take me to him in order to express my thanks

COVIELLE What He is going to come here

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Hes coming here

COVIELLE Yes And he is bringing everything for the ceremony of
bestowing your rank

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN That seems very quick

COVIELLE His love can suffer no delay

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN All that embarrasses me here is that my daughter
is a stubborn one who has gotten into her head a certain Cleonte
and she swears shell marry no one but him

COVIELLE Shell change her mind when she sees the son of the Grand
Turk and then there is a remarkable coincidence here it is that
the son of the Grand Turk resembles this Cleonte very closely I
just saw him someone showed him to me and the love she has for
the one can easily pass to the other and I hear him coming
There he is


ACT FOUR

SCENE IV Cleonte as a Turk with three Pages carrying his outer
clothes Monsieur Jourdain Covielle disguised

ACT FOUR

SCENE V Dorante Covielle

better Ah Ah Excuse me Sir Wouldnt you like to help us here

DORANTE Ah Ah Covielle who would have recognized you How you
are made up

COVIELLE You see ha ha

DORANTE What are you laughing at

COVIELLE At a thing Sir that well deserves it

DORANTE What

COVIELLE Ill give you many chances Sir to guess the stratagem
we are using on Monsieur Jourdain to get him to give his daughter
to my master

DORANTE I cant begin to guess the stratagem but I guess it will
not fail in its effect since you are undertaking it

COVIELLE I see Sir that you know me too well

DORANTE Tell me what it is

COVIELLE Come over here a little to make room for what I see
coming You can see part of the story while I tell you the rest

The Turkish ceremony for ennobling Monsieur Jourdain is performed
in dance and music and comprises the Fourth Interlude The
ceremony is a burlesque full of comic gibberish in pseudoTurkish
and nonsensical French in which Monsieur Jourdain is made to
appear ludicrous and during which he is outfitted with an
extravagant costume turban and sword


ACT FIVE

SCENE I Madame Jourdaine Monsieur Jourdain

MADAME JOURDAIN Ah My God Mercy What is all of this What a

shame on all sides She leaves


Act FIVE

SCENE II Dorante Dorimene

DORANTE Yes Madame you are going to see the most amusing thing
imaginable I dont believe it would be possible to find in all the
world another man as crazy as that one is And then too Madame we
must try to help Cleontes plan by supporting his masquerade Hes
a very gallant man and deserves our help

DORIMENE I think highly of him and he deserves happiness

DORANTE Besides that we have here Madame another ballet
performance that we shouldnt miss and I want to see if my idea
will succeed

DORIMENE I saw magnificent preparations and I can no longer
permit this Dorante Yes I finally want to end your extravagances
and to stop all these expenses that I see you go to for me I have
decided to marry you right away This is the truth of it that all
these sorts of things end with marriage as you know

DORANTE Ah Madame is it possible that you should have taken such
a sweet decision in my favor

DORIMENE It is only to impede you from ruining yourself without
that I see very well that before long you would not have a penny

DORANTE How obliged I am to you Madame for the care you have to
conserve my money It is entirely yours as well as my heart and
you may use them in whatever fashion you please

DORIMENE Ill make use of them both But here is your man his
costume is wonderful


ACT FIVE

SCENE III Monsieur Jourdain Dorante Dorimene

DORANTE Sir we come to pay homage Madame and I to your new
dignity and to rejoice with you at the marriage between your
daughter and the son of the Grand Turk

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN After bowing in the Turkish way Sir I wish
you the strength of serpents and the wisdom of lions

DORIMENE I was very glad Sir to be among the first to come to
congratulate you upon rising to such a high degree of honor

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN Madame I wish your rosebush to flower all year
long I am infinitely obliged to you for taking part in the honors
bestowed upon me and I am very happy to see you returned here so
I can make very humble excuses for the ridiculous behavior of my
wife

DORIMENE Thats nothing I excuse her jumping to conclusions
your heart must be precious to her and it isnt strange that the
possession of such a man as you should inspire some jealousy

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN The possession of my heart is a thing that has
been entirely gained by you

DORANTE You see Madame that Monsieur Jourdain is not one of
those men that good fortune blinds and that he still knows even
in his glory how to recognize his friends

contracts let us see our ballet and divert His Turkish Highness
with it
