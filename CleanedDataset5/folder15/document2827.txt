ASLAUGAS KNIGHT

By Fredrich de la MotteFouque




CHAPTER I


Many years ago there lived in the island of Fuhnen a noble knight
called Froda the friend of the Skalds who was so named because he not
only offered free hospitality in his fair castle to every renowned and
noble bard but likewise strove with all his might to discover those
ancient songs and tales and legends which in Runic writings or
elsewhere were still to be found he had even made some voyages to
Iceland in search of them and had fought many a hard battle with the
pirates of those seasfor he was also a right valiant knight and he
followed his great ancestors not only in their love of song but also
in their bold deeds of arms Although he was still scarcely beyond
the prime of youth yet all the other nobles in the island willingly
submitted themselves to him whether in council or in war nay his
renown had even been carried ere now over the sea to the neighbouring
land of Germany

One bright autumn evening this honourloving knight sat before his
castle as he was often wont to do that he might look far and wide over
land and sea and that he might invite any travellers who were passing
by as was his custom to share in his noble hospitality

But on this day he saw little of all that he was accustomed to look
upon for on his knees there lay an ancient book with skilfully and
richly painted characters which a learned Icelander had just sent to
him across the sea it was the history of Aslauga the fair daughter of
Sigurd who at first concealing her high birth kept goats among the
simple peasants of the land clothed in mean attire then in the golden
veil of her flowing hair won the love of King Ragnar Lodbrog and at
last shone brightly on the Danish throne as his glorious queen till the
day of her death

To the Knight Froda it seemed as though the gracious Lady Aslauga rose
in life and birth before him so that his calm and steadfast heart
true indeed to ladies service but never yet devoted to one particular
female image burst forth in a clear flame of love for the fair daughter
of Sigurd What matters it thought he to himself that it is more
than a hundred years since she disappeared from earth She sees so
clearly into this heart of mineand what more can a knight desire
wherefore she shall henceforth be my honoured love and shall inspire
me in battle and in song And therewith he sang a lay on his new love
which ran in the following manner


 They ride over hill and dale apace
 To seek for their love the fairest face
 They search through city and forestglade
 To find for their love the gentlest maid
 They climb wherever a path may lead
 To seek the wisest dame for their meed
 Ride on ye knights but ye never may see
 What the light of song has shown to me
 Loveliest gentlest and wisest of all
 Bold be the deeds that her name shall recall
 What though she neer bless my earthly sight
 Yet death shall reveal her countenance bright
 Fair world good night Good day sweet love
 Who seeks here in faith shall find above


Such purpose may come to good said a hollow voice near the knight
and when he looked round he saw the form of a poor peasant woman so
closely wrapped in a grey mantle that he could not discern any part of
her countenance She looked over his shoulder on the book and said
with a deep sigh I know that story well and it fares no better with
me than with the princess of whom it tells Froda looked at her with
astonishment Yes yes pursued she with strange becks and nods I
am the descendant of the mighty Rolf to whom the fairest castles and
forests and fields of this island once belonged your castle and your
domains Froda amongst others were his We are now cast down to
poverty and because I am not so fair as Aslauga there is no hope that
my possessions will be restored to me and therefore I am fain to veil
my poor face from every eye It seemed that she shed warm tears beneath
her mantle At this Froda was greatly moved and begged her for
Gods sake to let him know how he could help her for that he was a
descendant of the famous northern heroes of the olden time and perhaps
yet something more than theynamely a good Christian I almost
think murmured she from beneath her covering that you are that very
Froda whom men call the Good and the friend of the Skalds and of whose
generosity and mildness such wonderful stories are told If it be so
there may be help for me You need only give up to me the half of your
fields and meadows and I should be in a condition to live in some
measure such a life as befits the descendant of the mighty Rolf Then
Froda looked thoughtfully on the ground partly because she had asked
for so very much partly also because he was considering whether she
could really be descended from the powerful Rolf But the veiled form
said after a pause I must have been mistaken and you are not indeed
that renowned gentlehearted Froda for how could he have doubted so
long about such a trifle But I will try the utmost means See now for
the sake of the fair Aslauga of whom you have both read and sangfor
the sake of the honoured daughter of Sigurd grant my request Then
Froda started up eagerly and cried Let it be as you have said and
gave her his knightly hand to confirm his words But he could not grasp
the hand of the peasantwoman although her dark form remained close
before him A secret shudder began to run through his limbs whilst
suddenly a light seemed to shine forth from the apparitiona golden
lightin which she became wholly wrapped so that he felt as though
Aslauga stood before him in the flowing veil of her golden hair and
smiling graciously on him Transported and dazzled he sank on his
knees When he rose up once more he only saw a cloudy mist of autumn
spreading over the meadow fringed at its edges with lingering evening
lights and then vanishing far over the waves The knight scarcely knew
what had happened to him He returned to his chamber buried in thought
and sometimes feeling sure that he had beheld Aslauga sometimes again
that some goblin had risen before him with deceitful tricks mocking in
spiteful wise the service which he had vowed to his dead mistress
But henceforth wherever he roved over valley or forest or heath or
whether he sailed upon the waves of the sea the like appearances met
him Once he found a lute lying in a wood and drove a wolf away from
it and when sounds burst from the lute without its being touched a fair
child rose up from it as of old Aslauga herself had done At another
time he would see goats clambering among the highest cliffs by the
seashore and it was a golden form who tended them Then again a
bright queen resplendent in a dazzling bark would seem to glide past
him and salute him graciouslyand if he strove to approach any of
those he found nothing but cloud and mist and vapour Of all this many
a lay might be sung But so much he learnt from them allthat the fair
Lady Aslauga accepted his service and that he was now indeed and in
truth become her knight

Meanwhile the winter had come and gone In northern lands this season
never fails to bring to those who understand and love it many an image
full of beauty and meaning with which a child of man might well be
satisfied so far as earthly happiness can satisfy through all his time
on earth But when the spring came glancing forth with its opening buds
and flowing waters there came also bright and sunny tidings from the
land of Germany to Fuhnen

There stood on the rich banks of the Maine where it pours its waters
through the fertile land of Franconia a castle of almost royal
magnificence whose orphanmistress was a relation of the German
emperor She was named Hildegardis and was acknowledged far and wide
as the fairest of maidens Therefore her imperial uncle wished that she
should wed none but the bravest knight who could anywhere be met with
Accordingly he followed the example of many a noble lord in such a case
and proclaimed a tournament at which the chief prize should be the hand
of the peerless Hildegardis unless the victor already bore in his heart
a lady wedded or betrothed to him for the lists were not to be closed
to any brave warrior of equal birth that the contest of strength and
courage might be so much the richer in competitors

Now the renowned Froda had tidings of this from his German
brethreninarms and he prepared himself to appear at the festival
Before all things he forged for himself a splendid suit of armour as
indeed he was the most excellent armourer of the north farfamed as
it is for skill in that art He worked the helmet out of pure gold and
formed it so that it seemed to be covered with bright flowing locks
which called to mind Aslaugas tresses He also fashioned on the
breastplate of his armour overlaid with silver a golden image in half
relief which represented Aslauga in her veil of flowing locks that he
might make known even at the beginning of the tournamentThis knight
bearing the image of a lady upon his breast fights not for the hand
of the beautiful Hildegardis but only for the joy of battle and for
knightly fame Then he took out of his stables a beautiful Danish
steed embarked it carefully on board a vessel and sailed prosperously
to the opposite shore




CHAPTER II



In one of those fair beechwoods which abound in the fertile land of
Germany he fell in with a young and courteous knight of delicate form
who asked the noble northman to share the meal which he had invitingly
spread out upon the greensward under the shade of the pleasantest
boughs Whilst the two knights sat peacefully together at their repast
they felt drawn towards each other and rejoiced when on rising from it
they observed that they were about to follow the same road They had not
come to this good understanding by means of many words for the young
knight Edwald was of a silent nature and would sit for hours with a
quiet smile upon his lips without opening them to speak But even in
that quiet smile there lay a gentle winning grace and when from time
to time a few simple words of deep meaning sprang to his lips they
seemed like a gift deserving of thanks It was the same with the little
songs which he sang ever and anon they were ended almost as soon as
begun but in each short couplet there dwelt a deep and winning spirit
whether it called forth a kindly sigh or a peaceful smile It seemed
to the noble Froda as if a younger brother rode beside him or even a
tender blooming son They travelled thus many days together and it
appeared as if their path were marked out for them in inseparable union
and much as they rejoiced at this yet they looked sadly at each other
whenever they set out afresh or where crossroads met on finding that
neither took a different direction nay it seemed at times as if a tear
gathered in Edwalds downcast eye

It happened on a time that at their hostelry they met an arrogant
overbearing knight of gigantic stature and powerful frame whose
speech and carriage proved him to be not of German but foreign birth He
appeared to come from the land of Bohemia He cast a contemptuous
smile on Froda who as usual had opened the ancient book of Aslaugas
history and was attentively reading in it You must be a ghostly
knight he said inquiringly and it appeared as if a whole train of
unseemly jests were ready to follow But Froda answered so firmly and
seriously with a negative that the Bohemian stopped short suddenly
as when the beasts after venturing to mock their king the lion are
subdued to quietness by one glance of his eye But not so easily was
the Bohemian knight subdued rather the more did he begin to mock young
Edwald for his delicate form and for his silenceall which he bore for
some time with great patience but when at last the stranger used an
unbecoming phrase he arose girded on his sword and bowing gracefully
he said I thank you Sir Knight that you have given me this
opportunity of proving that I am neither a slothful nor unpractised
knight for only thus can your behaviour be excused which otherwise
must be deemed most unmannerly Are you ready

With these words he moved towards the door the Bohemian knight
followed smiling scornfully while Froda was full of care for his young
and slender companion although his honour was so dear to him that he
could in no way interpose

But it soon appeared how needless were the northmans fears With equal
vigour and address did Edwald assault his gigantic adversary so that to
look upon it was almost like one of those combats between a knight and
some monster of the forest of which ancient legends tell The issue
too was not unlike While the Bohemian was collecting himself for a
decisive stroke Edwald rushed in upon him and with the force of a
wrestler cast him to the ground But he spared his conquered foe
helped him courteously to rise and then turned to mount his own steed
Soon after he and Froda left the hostelry and once more their journey
led them on the same path as before

From henceforth this gives me pleasure said Froda pointing with
satisfaction to their common road I must own to you Edchenhe had
accustomed himself in loving confidence to call his young friend
by that childlike nameI must own to you that hitherto when I have
thought that you might perhaps be journeying with me to the tournament
held in honour of the fair Hildegardis a heaviness came over my heart
Your noble knightly spirit I well knew but I feared lest the strength
of your slender limbs might not be equal to it Now I have learned to
know you as a warrior who may long seek his match and God be praised if
we still hold on in the same path and welcome our earliest meeting in
the lists

But Edwald looked at him sorrowfully and said What can my skill
and strength avail if they be tried against you and for the greatest
earthly prize which one of us alone can win Alas I have long
foreboded with a heavy heart the sad truth that you also are journeying
to the tournament of the fair Hildegardis

Edchen answered Froda with a smile my gentle loving youth see
you not that I already wear on my breastplate the image of a liege lady
I strive but for renown in arms and not for your fair Hildegardis

MY fair Hildegardis answered Edwald with a sigh That she is not
nor ever will beor should she ah Froda it would pierce your heart
I know well the northland faith is deeprooted as your rocks and hard
to dissolve as their summits of snow but let no man think that he can
look unscathed into the eyes of Hildegardis Has not she the haughty
the too haughty maiden so bewitched my tranquil lowly mind that I
forget the gulf which lies between us and still pursue her and would
rather perish than renounce the daring hope to win that eagle spirit for
my own

I will help you to it Edchen answered Froda smiling still Would
that I knew how this allconquering lady looks She must resemble the
Valkyrien of our heathen forefathers since so many mighty warriors are
overcome by her

Edwald solemnly drew forth a picture from beneath his breastplate and
held it before him Fixed and as if enchanted Froda gazed upon it
with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes the smile passed away from his
countenance as the sunlight fades away from the meadows before the
coming darkness of the storm

See you not now my noble comrade whispered Edwald that for one of
us two or perhaps for both the joy of life is gone

Not yet replied Froda with a powerful effort but hide your magic
picture and let us rest beneath this shade You must be somewhat spent
with your late encounter and a strange weariness oppresses me with
leaden weight They dismounted from their steeds and stretched
themselves upon the ground

The noble Froda had no thought of sleep but he wished to be undisturbed
whilst he wrestled strongly with himself and strove if it might be to
drive from his mind that image of fearful beauty It seemed as if this
new influence had already become a part of his very life and at last
a restless dreamy sleep did indeed overshadow the exhausted warrior He
fancied himself engaged in combat with many knights whilst Hildegardis
looked on smiling from a richlyadorned balcony and just as he thought
he had gained the victory the bleeding Edwald lay groaning beneath his
horses feet Then again it seemed as if Hildegardis stood by his side
in a church and they were about to receive the marriageblessing He
knew well that this was not right and the yes which he was to utter
he pressed back with resolute effort into his heart and forthwith
his eyes were moistened with burning tears From yet stranger and more
bewildering visions the voice of Edwald at last awoke him He raised
himself up and heard his young companion saying courteously as he
looked towards a neighbouring thicket Only return noble maiden I
will surely help you if I can and I had no wish to scare you away but
that the slumbers of my brother in arms might not be disturbed by you
A golden gleam shone through the branches as it vanished

For heavens sake my faithful comrade cried Froda to whom are you
speaking and who has been here by me

I cannot myself rightly understand said Edwald Hardly had you
dropped asleep when a figure came forth from the forest closely wrapped
in a dark mantle At first I took her for a peasant She seated herself
at your head and though I could see nothing of her countenance I could
well observe that she was sorely troubled and even shedding tears I
made signs to her to depart lest she should disturb your sleep and
would have offered her a piece of gold supposing that poverty must
be the cause of her deep distress But my hand seemed powerless and
a shudder passed through me as if I had entertained such a purpose
towards a queen Immediately glittering locks of gold waved here and
there between the folds of her closewrapped mantle and the thicket
began almost to shine in the light which they shed Poor youth said
she then you love truly and can well understand how a lofty womans
heart burns in keenest sorrow when a noble knight who vowed himself to
be her own withdraws his heart and like a weak bondman is led away
to meaner hopes Hereupon she arose and sighing disappeared in
yonder thicket It almost seemed to me Froda as though she uttered
your name

Yes it was me she named answered Froda and not in vain she named
me Aslauga thy knight comes and enters the lists and all for thee
and thy reward alone At the same time my Edchen we will win for you
your haughty bride With this he sprang upon his steed full of the
proud joy of former times and when the magic of Hildegardis beauty
dazzling and bewildering would rise up before him he said smiling
Aslauga and the sun of his inner life shone forth again cloudless and
serene




CHAPTER III



From a balcony of her castle on the Maine Hildegardis was wont to
refresh herself in the cool of the evening by gazing on the rich
landscape below but gazing more eagerly on the glitter of arms
which often came in sight from many a distant road for knights were
approaching singly or with a train of followers all eager to prove
their courage and their strength in striving for the high prize of the
tournament She was in truth a proud and highminded maidenperhaps
more so than became even her dazzling beauty and her princely rank As
she now gazed with a proud smile on the glittering roads a damsel of her
train began the following lay


 The joyous song of birds in spring
 Upon the wing
 Doth echo far through wood and dell
 And freely tell
 Their treasures sweet of love and mirth
 Too gladsome for this lowly earth

 The gentle breath of flowers in May
 Oer meadows gay
 Doth fill the pure and balmy air
 With perfume rare
 Still floating round each slender form
 Though scorched by sun or torn by storm

 But every high and glorious aim
 And the pure flame
 That deep abiding in my heart
 Can neer depart
 Too lofty for my faltring tongue
 Must die with me unknown unsung


Wherefore do you sing that song and at this moment said Hildegardis
striving to appear scornful and proud though a deep and secret sadness
was plainly enough seen to overshadow her countenance It came into my
head unawares replied the damsel as I looked upon the road by which
the gentle Edwald with his pleasant lays first approached us for it was
from him I learnt it But seems it not to you my gracious lady and to
you too my companions as if Edwald himself were again riding that way
towards the castle Dreamer said Hildegardis scornfullyand yet
could not for some space withdraw her eyes from the knight till at
length with an effort she turned them on Froda who rode beside him
saying Yes truly that knight is Edwald but what can you find
to notice in the meekspirited silent boy Here fix your eyes my
maidens on this majestic figure if you would behold a knight indeed
She was silent A voice within her as though of prophecy said Now
the victor of the tournament rides into the courtyard and she who
had never feared the presence of any human being now felt humbled and
almost painfully awed when she beheld the northern knight

At the evening meal the two newlyarrived knights were placed opposite
to the royal Hildegardis As Froda after the northern fashion remained
in full armour the golden image of Aslauga gleamed from his silver
breastplate full before the eyes of the haughty lady She smiled
scornfully as if conscious that it depended on her will to drive that
image from the breast and from the heart of the strangerknight
Then suddenly a clear golden light passed through the hall so that
Hildegardis said O the keen lightning and covered her eyes with
both her hands But Froda looked into the dazzling radiance with a
joyful gaze of welcome At this Hildegardis feared him yet more though
at the same time she thought This loftiest and most mysterious of men
must be born for me alone Yet could she not forbear almost against
her will to look from time to time in friendly tenderness on the poor
Edwald who sat there silent and with a sweet smile seemed to pity and
to mock his own suffering and his own vain hopes

When the two knights were alone in their sleepingchamber Edwald looked
for a long time in silence into the dewy balmy night Then he sang to
his lute


 A hero wise and brave
 A lowly tender youth
 Are wandering through the land
 In steadfast love and truth

 The hero by his deeds
 Both bliss and fame had won
 And still with heartfelt joy
 The faithful child looked on


But Froda took the lute from his hands and said No Edchen I will
teach you another song listen


 Theres a gleam in the hall and like mornings light
 Hath shone upon all her presence bright
 Suitors watch as she passes by
 She may gladden their hearts by one glance of her eye
 But coldly she gazeth upon the throng
 And they that have sought her may seek her long
 She turns her away from the richly clad knight
 She heeds not the words of the learned wight
 The prince is before her in all his pride
 But other the visions around her that glide
 Then tell me in all the wide worlds space
 Who may eer win that ladys grace
 In sorrowful love there sits apart
 The gentle squire who hath her heart
 They all are deceived by fancies vain
 And he knows it not who the prize shall gain


Edwald thrilled As God wills said he softly to himself But I
cannot understand how such a thing could be As God wills repeated
Froda The two friends embraced each other and soon after fell into a
peaceful slumber

Some days afterwards Froda sat in a secluded bower of the castle garden
and was reading in the ancient book of his lovely mistress Aslauga It
happened at that very time that Hildegardis passed by She stood still
and said thoughtfully Strange union that you are of knight and sage
how comes it that you bring forth so little out of the deep treasures of
your knowledge And yet I think you must have many a choice history at
your command even such as that which now lies open before you for I
see rich and bright pictures of knights and ladies painted amongst the
letters

It is indeed the most surpassing and enchanting history in all the
world said Froda but you have neither patience nor thoughtfulness to
listen to our wonderful legends of the north

Why think you so answered Hildegardis with that pride which she
rejoiced to display towards Froda when she could find courage to do so
and placing herself on a stone seat opposite she commanded him at once
to read something to her out of that fair book

Froda began and in the very effort which he made to change the old
heroic speech of Iceland into the German tongue his heart and mind were
stirred more fervently and solemnly As he looked up from time to time
he beheld the countenance of Hildegardis beaming in evergrowing beauty
with joy wonder and interest and the thought passed through his mind
whether this could indeed be his destined bride to whom Aslauga herself
was guiding him

Then suddenly the characters became strangely confused it seemed as
if the pictures began to move so that he was obliged to stop While he
fixed his eyes with a strong effort upon the book endeavouring to drive
away this strange confusion he heard a wellknown sweetly solemn voice
which said Leave a little space for me fair lady The history which
that knight is reading to you relates to me and I hear it gladly

Before the eyes of Froda as he raised them from his book sat Aslauga
in all the glory of her flowing golden locks beside Hildegardis on
the seat With tears of affright in her eyes the maiden sank back and
fainted Solemnly yet graciously Aslauga warned her knight with a
motion of her fair right hand and vanished

What have I done to you said Hildegardis when recovered from her
swoon by his care what have I done to you evilminded knight that
you call up your northern spectres before me and wellnigh destroy me
through terror of your magic arts Lady answered Froda may God help
me as I have not called hither the wondrous lady who but now appeared
to us But now her will is known to me and I commend you to Gods
keeping

With that he walked thoughtfully out of the bower Hildegardis fled in
terror from the gloomy shade and rushing out on the opposite side
reached a fair open grassplot where Edwald in the soft glow of
twilight was gathering flowers and meeting her with a courteous
smile offered her a nosegay of narcissus and pansies




CHAPTER IV



At length the day fixed for the tournament arrived and a distinguished
noble appointed by the German emperor arranged all things in the most
magnificent and sumptuous guise for the solemn festival The field of
combat opened wide and fair and level thickly strewn with the finest
sand so that both man and horse might find sure footing and like a
pure field of snow it shone forth from the midst of the flowery plain
Rich hangings of silk from Arabia curiously embroidered with Indian
gold adorned with their various colours the lists enclosing the space
and hung from the lofty galleries which had been erected for the ladies
and the nobles who were to behold the combat At the upper end under a
canopy of majestic arches richly wrought in gold was the place of the
Lady Hildegardis Green wreaths and garlands waved gracefully between
the glittering pillars in the soft breezes of July And with impatient
eyes the multitude who crowded beyond the lists gazed upwards
expecting the appearance of the fairest maiden of Germany and were
only at times drawn to another part by the stately approach of the
combatants Oh how many a bright suit of armour many a silken
richlyembroidered mantle how many a lofty waving plume was here to be
seen The splendid troop of knights moved within the lists greeting and
conversing with each other as a bed of flowers stirred by a breath
of wind but the flowerstems had grown to lofty trees the yellow and
white flowerleaves had changed to gold and silver and the dewdrops to
pearls and diamonds For whatever was most fair and costly most varied
and full of meaning had these noble knights collected in honour of
this day Many an eye was turned on Froda who without scarf plume
or mantle with his shining silver breastplate on which appeared the
golden image of Aslauga and with his wellwrought helmet of golden
locks shone in the midst of the crowd like polished brass Others
again there were who took pleasure in looking at the young Edwald his
whole armour was covered by a mantle of white silk embroidered in azure
and silver as his whole helmet was concealed by a waving plume of white
feathers He was arrayed with almost feminine elegance and yet the
conscious power with which he controlled his fiery snowwhite steed
made known the victorious strength and manliness of the warlike
stripling

In strange contrast appeared the tall and almost gigantic figure of
a knight clothed in a mantle of black glossy bearskin bordered with
costly fur but without any ornament of shining metal His very helmet
was covered with dark bearskin and instead of plumes a mass of
bloodred horsehair hung like a flowing mane profusely on every side
Well did Froda and Edwald remember that dark knight for he was the
uncourteous guest of the hostelry He also seemed to remark the two
knights for he turned his unruly steed suddenly round forced his
way through the crowd of warriors and after he had spoken over the
enclosure to a hideous bronzecoloured woman sprang with a wild leap
across the lists and with the speed of an arrow vanished out of
sight The old woman looked after him with a friendly nod The assembled
people laughed as at a strange masquing device but Edwald and Froda
had their own almost shuddering thoughts concerning it which however
neither imparted to the other

The kettledrums rolled the trumpets sounded and led by the aged duke
Hildegardis advanced richly apparelled but more dazzling through the
brightness of her own beauty She stepped forward beneath the arches of
the golden bower and bowed to the assembly The knights bent low and
the feeling rushed into many a heart There is no man on earth who can
deserve a bride so queenly When Froda bowed his head it seemed to him
as if the golden radiance of Aslaugaa tresses floated before his sight
and his spirit rose in joy and pride that his lady held him worthy to be
so often reminded of her

And now the tournament began At first the knights strove with blunted
swords and battleaxes then they ran their course with lances man to
man but at last they divided into two equal parties and a general
assault began in which every one was allowed to use at his own
will either sword or lance Froda and Edwald equally surpassed their
antagonists as measuring each his own strength and that of his friend
they had foreseen And now it must be decided by a single combat with
lances to whom the highest prize of victory should belong Before this
trial began they rode slowly together into the middle of the course
and consulted where each should take his place Keep you your
guidingstar still before your sight said Froda with a smile the
like gracious help will not be wanting to me Edwald looked round
astonished for the lady of whom his friend seemed to speak but Froda
went on I have done wrong in hiding aught from you but after the
tournament you shall know all Now lay aside all needless thoughts of
wonder dear Edchen and sit firm in your saddle for I warn you that
I shall run this course with all my might Not my honour alone is at
stake but the far higher honour of my lady

So also do I purpose to demean myself said Edwald with a friendly
smile They shook each other by the hand and rode to their places

Amidst the sound of trumpets they met again running their course with
lightning speed the lances shivered with a crash the horses staggered
the knights firm in their saddles pulled them up and rode back to
their places But as they prepared for another course Edwalds white
steed snorted in wild affright and Frodas powerful chestnut reared up
foaming

It was plain that the two noble animals shrunk from a second hard
encounter but their riders held them fast with spur and bit and
firm and obedient they again dashed forward at the second call of
the trumpet Edwald who by one deep ardent gaze on the beauty of his
mistress had stamped it afresh on his soul cried aloud at the moment
of encounter Hildegardis and so mightily did his lance strike
his valiant adversary that Froda sank backwards on his steed with
difficulty keeping his seat in his saddle or holding firm in his
stirrups whilst Edwald flew by unshaken lowered his spear to salute
Hildegardis as he passed her bower and then amidst the loud applause
of the multitude rushed to his place ready for the third course And
ah Hildegardis herself overcome by surprise had greeted him with a
blush and a look of kindness it seemed to him as if the overwhelming
joy of victory were already gained But it was not so for the valiant
Froda burning with noble shame had again tamed his affrighted
steed and chastising him sharply with the spur for his share in
this mischance said in a low voice Beautiful and beloved lady show
thyself to methe honour of thy name is at stake To every other eye
it seemed as if a golden rosytinted summers cloud was passing over the
deepblue sky but Froda beheld the heavenly countenance of his lady
felt the waving of her golden tresses and cried Aslauga The two
rushed together and Edwald was hurled from his saddle far upon the
dusty plain

Froda remained for a time motionless according to the laws of chivalry
as though waiting to see whether any one would dispute his victory
and appearing on his mailed steed like some lofty statue of brass All
around stood the multitude in silent wonderment When at length they
burst forth into shouts of triumph he beckoned earnestly with his hand
and all were again silent He then sprang lightly from his saddle and
hastened to the spot where the fallen Edwald was striving to rise He
pressed him closely to his breast led his snowwhite steed towards
him and would not be denied holding the stirrups of the youth whilst
he mounted Then he bestrode his own steed and rode by Edwalds side
towards the golden bower of Hildegardis where with lowered spear and
open vizor he thus spoke Fairest of all living ladies I bring you
here Edwald your knightly bridegroom before whose lance and sword all
the knights of this tournament have fallen away I only excepted who
can make no claim to the choicest prize of victory since I as the
image on my breastplate may show already serve another mistress

The duke was even now advancing towards the two warriors to lead them
into the golden bower but Hildegardis restrained him with a look of
displeasure saying immediately while her cheeks glowed with anger
Then you seem Sir Froda the Danish knight to serve your lady ill
for even now you openly styled me the fairest of living ladies

That did I answered Froda bending courteously because my fair
mistress belongs to the dead

A slight shudder passed at these words through the assembly and through
the heart of Hildegardis but soon the anger of the maiden blazed forth
again and the more because the most wonderful and excellent knight she
knew had scorned her for the sake of a dead mistress

I make known to all she said with solemn earnestness that
according to the just decree of my imperial uncle this hand can never
belong to a vanquished knight however noble and honourable he may
otherwise have proved himself As the conqueror of this tournament
therefore is bound to another service this combat concerns me not and
I depart hence as I came a free and unbetrothed maiden

The duke seemed about to reply but she turned haughtily away and left
the bower Suddenly a gust of wind shook the green wreaths and garlands
and they fell untwined and rustling behind her In this the people
displeased with the pride of Hildegardis thought they beheld an omen of
punishment and with jeering words noticed it as they departed




CHAPTER V



The two knights had returned to their apartments in deep silence When
they arrived there Edwald caused himself to be disarmed and laid every
piece of his fair shining armour together with a kind of tender care
almost as if he were burying the corpse of a beloved friend Then he
beckoned to his squires to leave the chamber took his lute on his arm
and sang the following song to its notes


 Bury them bury them out of sight
 For hope and fame are fled
 And peaceful resting and quiet night
 Are all now left for the dead


You will stir up my anger against your lute said Froda You had
accustomed it to more joyful songs than this It is too good for a
passingbell and you too good to toll it I tell you yet my young
hero all will end gloriously

Edwald looked a while with wonder in his face and he answered kindly
Beloved Froda if it displeases you I will surely sing no more But
at the same time he struck a few sad chords which sounded infinitely
sweet and tender Then the northern knight much moved clasped him in
his arms and said Dear Edchen sing and say and do whatever pleases
you it shall ever rejoice me But you may well believe me for I speak
not this without a spirit of presageyour sorrow shall change whether
to death or life I know not but great and overpowering joy awaits you
Edwald rose firmly and cheerfully from his seat seized his companions
arm with a strong grasp and walked forth with him through the blooming
alleys of the garden into the balmy air

At that very hour an aged woman muffled in many a covering was led
secretly to the apartment of the Lady Hildegardis The appearance of the
darkcomplexioned stranger was mysterious and she had gathered round
her for some time by many feats of jugglery a part of the multitude
returning home from the tournament but had dispersed them at last in
wild affright Before this happened the tirewoman of Hildegardis had
hastened to her mistress to entertain her with an account of the
rare and pleasant feats of the bronzecoloured woman The maidens in
attendance seeing their lady deeply moved and wishing to banish
her melancholy bade the tirewoman bring the old stranger hither
Hildegardis forbade it not hoping that she should thus divert the
attention of her maidens while she gave herself up more deeply and
earnestly to the varying imaginations which flitted through her mind

The messenger found the place already deserted and the strange old
woman alone in the midst laughing immoderately When questioned by her
she did not deny that she had all at once taken the form of a monstrous
owl announcing to the spectators in a screeching voice that she was the
Deviland that every one upon this rushed screaming home

The tirewoman trembled at the fearful jest but durst not return to
ask again the pleasure of Hildegardis whose discontented mood she had
already remarked She gave strict charge to the old woman with many a
threat and promise to demean herself discreetly in the castle after
which she brought her in by the most secret way that none of those whom
she had terrified might see her enter

The aged crone now stood before Hildegardis and winked to her in the
midst of her low and humble salutation in a strangely familiar
manner as though there were some secret between them The lady felt an
involuntary shudder and could not withdraw her gaze from the features
of that hideous countenance hateful as it was to her The curiosity
which had led the rest to desire a sight of the strange woman was by no
means gratified for she performed none but the most common tricks of
jugglery and related only wellknown tales so that the tirewoman felt
wearied and indifferent and ashamed of having brought the stranger she
stole away unnoticed Several other maidens followed her example and
as these withdrew the old crone twisted her mouth into a smile
and repeated the same hideous confidential wink towards the lady
Hildegardis could not understand what attracted her in the jests and
tales of the bronzecoloured woman but so it was that in her whole
life she had never bestowed such attention on the words of any one
Still the old woman went on and on and already the night looked
dark without the windows but the attendants who still remained with
Hildegardis had sunk into a deep sleep and had lighted none of the wax
tapers in the apartment

Then in the dusky gloom the dark old crone rose from the low seat on
which she had been sitting as if she now felt herself well at ease
advanced towards Hildegardis who sat as if spellbound with terror
placed herself beside her on the purple couch and embracing her in her
long dry arms with a hateful caress whispered a few words in her ear
It seemed to the lady as if she uttered the names of Froda and Edwald
and from them came the sound of a flute which clear and silvery as
were its tones seemed to lull her into a trance She could indeed
move her limbs but only to follow those sounds which like a silver
network floated round the hideous form of the old woman She moved from
the chamber and Hildegardis followed her through all her slumbering
maidens still singing softly as she went Ye maidens ye maidens I
wander by night

Without the castle accompanied by squire and groom stood the gigantic
Bohemian warrior he laid on the shoulders of the crone a bag of gold so
heavy that she sank half whimpering half laughing on the ground then
lifted the entranced Hildegardis on his steed and galloped with her
silently into the everdeepening gloom of night

All ye noble lords and knights who yesterday contended gallantly for
the prize of victory and the hand of the peerless Hildegardis arise
arise saddle your steeds and to the rescue The peerless Hildegardis
is carried away

Thus proclaimed many a herald through castle and town in the bright red
dawn of the following day and on all sides rose the dust from the tread
of knights and noble squires along those roads by which so lately
in the evening twilight Hildegardis in proud repose had gazed on her
approaching suitors

Two of them well known to us remained inseparably together but they
knew as little as the others whether they had taken the right direction
for how and when the adored lady could have disappeared from her
apartments was still to the whole castle a fearful and mysterious
secret

Edwald and Froda rode as long as the sun moved over their heads
unwearied as he and now when he sank in the waves of the river they
thought to win the race from him and still spurred on their jaded
steeds But the noble animals staggered and panted and the knights were
constrained to grant them some little refreshment in a grassy meadow
Secure of bringing them back at their first call their masters removed
both bit and curb that they might be refreshed with the green pasture
and with the deep blue waters of the Maine while they themselves
reposed under the shade of a neighbouring thicket of alders And deep
in the cool dark shade there shone as it were a mild but clear
sparkling light and checked the speech of Froda who at that moment
was beginning to tell his friend the tale of his knightly service to
his sovereign lady which had been delayed hitherto first by Edwalds
sadness and then by the haste of their journey Ah well did Froda know
that lovely golden light Let us follow it Edchen said he in a low
tone and leave the horses a while to their pasture Edwald in silence
followed his companions advice A secret voice half sweet half
fearful seemed to tell him that here was the path the only right path
to Hildegardis Once only he said in astonishment Never before have I
seen the evening glow shine on the leaves so brightly Froda shook his
head with a smile and they pursued in silence their unknown track

When they came forth on the other side of the alderthicket upon the
bank of the Maine which almost wound round it Edwald saw well that
another glow than that of evening was shining on them for dark clouds
of night already covered the heavens and the guiding light stood fixed
on the shore of the river It lit up the waves so that they could see
a high woody island in the midst of the stream and a boat on the hither
side of the shore fast bound to a stake But on approaching the knights
saw much more a troop of horsemen of strange and foreign appearance
were all asleep and in the midst of them slumbering on cushions a
female form in white garments

Hildegardis murmured Edwald to himself with a smile and at the
same time he drew his sword in readiness for the combat as soon as the
robbers should awake and beckoned to Froda to raise the sleeping lady
and convey her to a place of safety But at this moment something like
an owl passed whizzing over the dark squadron and they all started up
with clattering arms and hideous outcries A wild unequal combat arose
in the darkness of night for that beaming light had disappeared
Freda and Edwald were driven asunder and only at a distance heard each
others mighty warcry Hildegardis startled from her magic sleep
uncertain whether she were waking or dreaming fled bewildered and
weeping bitterly into the deep shades of the alderthicket




CHAPTER VI



Froda felt his arm grow weary and the warm blood was flowing from two
wounds in his shoulder he wished so to lie down in death that he might
rise up with honour from his bloody grave to the exalted lady whom he
served He cast his shield behind him grasped his swordhilt with both
hands and rushed wildly with a loud warcry upon the affrighted foe
Instantly he heard some voices cry It is the rage of the northern
heroes which has come upon him And the whole troop were scattered in
dismay while the exhausted knight remained wounded and alone in the
darkness

Then the golden hair of Aslauga gleamed once more in the aldershade
and Froda said leaning through weariness on his sword I think not
that I am wounded to death but whenever that time shall come O beloved
lady wilt thou not indeed appear to me in all thy loveliness and
brightness A soft Yes breathed against his cheek and the golden
light vanished

But now Hildegardis came forth from the thicket half fainting with
terror and said feebly Within is the fair and frightful spectre of
the northwithout is the battle Oh merciful heaven whither shall I
go

Then Froda approached to sooth the affrighted one to speak some words
of comfort to her and to inquire after Edwald but wild shouts and the
rattling of armour announced the return of the Bohemian warriors With
haste Froda led the maiden to the boat pushed off from the shore
and rowed her with the last effort of his failing strength towards
the island which he had observed in the midst of the stream But the
pursuers had already kindled torches and waved them sparkling here and
there By this light they soon discovered the boat they saw that the
dreaded Danish knight was bleeding and gained fresh courage for their
pursuit Hardly had Froda pushed the boat to the shore of the island
before he perceived a Bohemian on the other side in another skiff and
soon afterwards the greater number of the enemy embarked to row towards
the island To the wood fair maiden he whispered as soon as he
had landed Hildegardis on the shore there conceal yourself whilst
I endeavour to prevent the landing of the robbers But Hildegardis
clinging to his arm whispered again Do I not see that you are pale
and bleeding and would you have me expire with terror in the dark and
lonely clefts of this rock Ah and if your northern goldhaired spectre
were to appear again and seat herself beside me Think you that I do not
see her there now shining through the thicket

She shines echoed Froda and new strength and hope ran through
every vein He climbed the hill following the gracious gleam and
Hildegardis though trembling at the sight went readily with her
companion saying only from time to time in a low voice Ah Sir
Knightmy noble wondrous knightleave me not here alone that would
be my death The knight soothing her courteously stepped ever onwards
through the darkness of dell and forest for already he heard the sound
of the Bohemians landing on the shore of the island Suddenly he stood
before a cave thickcovered with underwood and the gleam disappeared
Here then he whispered endeavouring to hold the branches asunder
For a moment she paused and said If you should but let the branches
close again behind me and I were to remain alone with spectres in this
cave But Froda you will surely follow mea trembling hunted child
as I am Will you not Without more misgivings she passed through the
branches and the knight who would willingly have remained without as a
guard followed her Earnestly he listened through the stillness of
the night whilst Hildegardis hardly dared to draw her breath Then was
heard the tramp of an armed man coming ever nearer and nearer and
now close to the entrance of the cave In vain did Froda strive to
free himself from the trembling maiden Already the branches before the
entrance were cracking and breaking and Froda sighed deeply Must I
then fall like a lurking fugitive entangled in a womans garments It
is a base death to die But can I cast this halffainting creature away
from me on the dark hard earth perhaps into some deep abyss Come
then what will thou Lady Aslauga knowest that I die an honourable
death

Froda Hildegardis breathed a gentle wellknown voice at the
entrance and recognising Edwald Froda bore the lady towards him into
the starlight saying She will die of terror in our sight in this
deep cavern Is the foe near at hand Most of them lie lifeless on the
shore or swim bleeding through the waves said Edwald Set your mind
at rest and repose yourself Are you wounded beloved Froda He gave
this short account to his astonished companionshow in the darkness
he had mixed with the Bohemians and pressed into the skiff and that it
had been easy to him on landing to disperse the robbers entirely who
supposed that they were attacked by one of their own crew and thought
themselves bewitched They began at last to fall on one anotherso
he ended his history and we have only now to wait for the morning
to conduct the lady home for those who are wandering about of that
owlsquadron will doubtless hide themselves from the eye of day While
speaking he had skilfully and carefully arranged a couch of twigs and
moss for Hildegardis and when the wearied one after uttering some
gentle words of gratitude had sunk into a slumber he began as well
as the darkness would allow to bind up the wounds of his friend During
this anxious task while the dark boughs of the trees murmured over
their heads and the rippling of the stream was heard from afar Froda
in a low voice made known to his brotherinarms to the service of what
lady he was bound Edwald listened with deep attention but at last he
said tenderly Trust me the noble Princess Aslauga will not resent it
if you pledge yourself to this earthly beauty in faithful love Ah
even now doubtless you are sinning in the dreams of Hildegardis
richlygifted and happy knight I will not stand in your way with
my vain wishes I see now clearly that she can never never love me
Therefore I will this very day hasten to the war which so many valiant
knights of Germany are waging in the heathen land of Prussia and the
black cross which distinguishes them for warriors of the Church I will
lay as the best balm on my throbbing heart Take then dear Froda that
fair hand which you have won in battle and live henceforth a life of
surpassing happiness and joy

Edwald said Froda gravely this is the first time that I ever heard
one word from your lips which a true knight could not fulfil Do as
it pleases you towards the fair and haughty Hildegardis but Aslauga
remains my mistress ever and no other do I desire in life or death
The youth was startled by these stern words and made no reply Both
without saying more to each other watched through the night in solemn
thought

The next morning when the rising sun shone brightly over the flowery
plains around the Castle of Hildegardis the watchman on the tower blew
a joyful blast from his horn for his keen eye had distinguished far in
the distance his fair lady who was riding from the forest between her
two deliverers and from castle town and hamlet came forth many a
rejoicing train to assure themselves with their own eyes of the happy
news

Hildegardis turned to Edwald with eyes sparkling through tears and
said Were it not for you young knight they might have sought long
and vainly before they found the lost maiden or the noble Froda who
would now be lying in that dark cavern a bleeding and lifeless corpse
Edwald bowed lowly in reply but persevered in his wonted silence
It even seemed as though an unusual grief restrained the smile which
erewhile answered so readily in childlike sweetness to every friendly
word

The noble guardian of Hildegardis had in the overflowing joy of his
heart prepared a sumptuous banquet and invited all the knights
and ladies present to attend it Whilst Froda and Edwald in all the
brightness of their glory were ascending the steps in the train of
their rescued lady Edwald said to his friend Noble steadfast knight
you can never love me more And as Froda looked in astonishment he
continuedThus it is when children presume to counsel heroes however
well they may mean it Now have I offended grievously against you
and yet more against the noble Lady Aslauga Because you would have
plucked every flower of your own garden to gladden me with them said
Froda No you are my gentle brotherinarms now as heretofore dear
Edchen and are perhaps become yet dearer to me

Then Edwald smiled again in silent contentment like a flower after the
morning showers of May

The eyes of Hildegardis glanced mildly and kindly on him and she
often conversed graciously with him while on the other hand since
yesterday a reverential awe seemed to separate her from Froda But
Edwald also was much altered However he welcomed with modest joy the
favour of his lady it yet seemed as if some barrier were between them
which forbade him to entertain the most distant hope of successful love

It chanced that a noble count from the court of the Emperor was
announced who being bound on an important embassy had wished to
pay his respects to the Lady Hildegardis by the way She received him
gladly and as soon as the first salutations were over he said looking
at her and at Edwald I know not if my good fortune may not have
brought me hither to a very joyful festivity That would be right
welcome news to the Emperor my master Hildegardis and Edwald were
lovely to look upon in their blushes and confusion but the count
perceiving at once that he had been too hasty inclined himself
respectfully towards the young knight and said Pardon me noble Duke
Edwald my too great forwardness but I know the wish of my sovereign
and the hope to find it already fulfilled prompted my tongue to speak
All eyes were fixed inquiringly on the young hero who answered in
graceful confusion It is true the Emperor when I was last in his
camp through his undeserved favour raised me to the rank of a duke
It was my good fortune that in an encounter some of the enemys horse
who had dared to assault the sacred person of the Emperor dispersed
and fled on my approach The count then at the request of Hildegardis
related every circumstance of the heroic deed and it appeared that
Edwald had not only rescued the Emperor from the most imminent peril
but also with the cool and daring skill of a general had gained the
victory which decided the event of the war

Surprise at first sealed the lips of all and even before their
congratulations could begin Hildegardis had turned towards Edwald and
said in a low voice which yet in that silence was clearly heard by
all The noble count has made known the wish of my imperial uncle
and I conceal it no longer my own hearts wish is the sameI am Duke
Edwalds bride And with that she extended to him her fair right hand
and all present waited only till he should take it before they burst
into a shout of congratulation But Edwald forbore to do so he only
sunk on one knee before his lady saying God forbid that the lofty
Hildegardis should ever recall a word spoken solemnly to noble knights
and dames To no vanquished knight you said might the hand of
the Emperors niece belongand behold there Froda the noble Danish
knight my conqueror Hildegardis with a slight blush turned hastily
away hiding her eyes and as Edwald arose it seemed as though there
were a tear upon his cheek

In his clanging armour Froda advanced to the middle of the hall
exclaiming I declare my late victory over Duke Edwald to have been
the chance of fortune and I challenge the noble knight to meet me again
tomorrow in the lists

At the same time he threw his iron gauntlet ringing on the pavement

But Edwald moved not to take it up On the contrary a glow of lofty
anger was on his cheeks and his eyes sparkled with indignation so
that his friend would hardly have recognised him and after a silence he
spoke

Noble Sir Froda if I have ever offended you we are now even How
durst you a warrior gloriously wounded by two swordstrokes challenge
a man unhurt into the lists tomorrow if you did not despise him

Forgive me Duke Edwald answered Froda somewhat abashed but with
cheerfulness I have spoken too boldly Not till I am completely cured
do I call you to the field

Then Edwald took up the gauntlet joyfully He knelt once more before
Hildegardis who turning away her face gave him her fair hand to kiss
and walked with his arm in that of his noble Danish friend out of the
hall




CHAPTER VII



While Frodas wounds were healing Edwald would sometimes wander when
the shades of evening fell dark and silent around on the flowery
terraces beneath the windows of Hildegardis and sing pleasant little
songs amongst others the following


 Heal fast heal fast ye herowounds
 O knight be quickly strong
 Beloved strife
 For fame and life
 O tarry not too long


But that one which the maidens of the castle loved best to learn from
him was this and it was perhaps the longest song that Edwald had ever
sung in his whole life


 Would I on earth were lying
 By noble hero slain
 So that loves gentle sighing
 Breathed me to life again

 Would I an emperor were
 Of wealth and power
 Would I were gathering twigs
 In woodland bower

 Would that in lone seclusion
 I lived a hermits life
 Would amid wild confusion
 I led the battlestrife

 O would the lot were mine
 In bower or field
 To which my lady fair
 Her smile would yield


At this time it happened that a man who held himself to be very
wise and who filled the office of secretary to the aged guardian of
Hildegardis came to the two knightly friends to propose a scheme to
them His proposal in few words was this that as Froda could gain no
advantage from his victory he might in the approaching combat suffer
himself to be thrown from his steed and thus secure the lady for his
comrade at the same time fulfilling the wish of the Emperor which
might turn to his advantage hereafter in many ways

At this the two friends at first laughed heartily but then Froda
advanced gravely towards the secretary and said Thou trifler
doubtless the old duke would drive thee from his service did he know
of thy folly and teach thee to talk of the Emperor Goodnight worthy
sir and trust me that when Edwald and I meet each other it will be
with all our heart and strength

The secretary hastened out of the room with all speed and was seen next
morning to look unusually pale


Soon after this Froda recovered from his wounds the course was again
prepared as before but crowded by a still greater number of spectators
and in the freshness of a dewy morning the two knights advanced solemnly
together to the combat

Beloved Edwald said Froda in a low voice as they went take good
heed to yourself for neither this time can the victory be yourson
that rosecoloured cloud appears Aslauga

It may be so answered Edwald with a quiet smile but under the
arches of that golden bower shines Hildegardis and this time she has
not been waited for

The knights took their placesthe trumpets sounded the course began
and Frodas prophecy seemed to be near its fulfilment for Edwald
staggered under the stroke of his lance so that he let go the bridle
seized the mane with both hands and thus hardly recovered his seat
whilst his highmettled snowwhite steed bore him wildly around the
lists without control Hildegardis also seemed to shrink at this sight
but the youth at length reinedin his steed and the second course was
run

Froda shot like lightning along the plain and it seemed as if the
success of the young duke were now hopeless but in the shock of their
meeting the bold Danish steed reared starting aside as if in fear
the rider staggered his stroke passed harmless by and both steed and
knight fell clanging to the ground before the steadfast spear of Edwald
and lay motionless upon the field

Edwald did now as Froda had done before In knightly wise he stood still
a while upon the spot as if waiting to see whether any other adversary
were there to dispute his victory then he sprang from his steed and
flew to the assistance of his fallen friend

He strove with all his might to release him from the weight of his
horse and presently Froda came to himself rose on his feet and
raised up his charger also Then he lifted up his vizor and greeted his
conqueror with a friendly smile though his countenance was pale
The victor bowed humbly almost timidly and said You my knight
overthrownand by me I understand it not

It was her own will answered Froda smiling Come now to your gentle
bride

The multitude around shouted aloud each lady and knight bowed low when
the aged duke pointed out to them the lovely pair and at his bidding
the betrothed with soft blushes embraced each other beneath the green
garlands of the golden bower

That very day were they solemnly united in the chapel of the castle for
so had Froda earnestly desired A journey into a fardistant land he
said lay before him and much he wished to celebrate the marriage of
his friend before his departure




CHAPTER VIII



The torches were burning clear in the vaulted halls of the castle
Hildegardis had just left the arm of her lover to begin a stately dance
of ceremony with the aged duke when Edwald beckoned to his companion
and they went forth together into the moonlit gardens of the castle

Ah Froda my noble lofty hero exclaimed Edwald after a silence
were you as happy as I am But your eyes rest gravely and thoughtfully
on the ground or kindle almost impatiently heavenwards It would
be dreadful indeed had the secret wish of your heart been to win
Hildegardisand I foolish boy so strangely favoured had stood in
your way

Be at rest Edchen answered the Danish hero with a smile On
the word of a knight my thoughts and yearnings concern not your fair
Hildegardis Far brighter than ever does Aslaugas radiant image shine
into my heart but now hear what I am going to relate to you

At the very moment when we met together in the courseoh had I words
to express it to youI was enwrapped encircled dazzled by Aslaugas
golden tresses which were waving all around me Even my noble steed
must have beheld the apparition for I felt him start and rear under
me I saw you no morethe world no moreI saw only the angelface of
Aslauga close before me smiling blooming like a flower in a sea of
sunshine which floated round her My senses failed me Not till you
raised me from beneath my horse did my consciousness return and then I
knew with exceeding joy that her own gracious pleasure had struck me
down But I felt a strange weariness far greater than my fall alone
could have caused and I felt assured at the same time that my lady was
about to send me on a fardistant mission I hastened to repose myself
in my chamber and a deep sleep immediately fell upon me Then came
Aslauga in a dream to me more royally adorned than ever she placed
herself at the head of my couch and said Haste to array thyself
in all the splendour of thy silver armour for thou art not the
weddingguest alone thou art also the

And before she could speak the word my dream had melted away and I
felt a longing desire to fulfil her gracious command and rejoiced in my
heart But in the midst of the festival I seemed to myself more lonely
than in all my life before and I cannot cease to ponder what that
unspoken word of my lady could be intended to announce

You are of a far loftier spirit than I am Froda said Edwald after
a silence and I cannot soar with you into the sphere of your joys But
tell me has it never awakened a deep pang within you that you serve a
lady so withdrawn from youalas a lady who is almost ever invisible

No Edwald not so answered Froda his eyes sparkling with happiness
For well I know that she scorns not my service she has even deigned
sometimes to appear to me Oh I am in truth a happy knight and
minstrel

And yet your silence todayyour troubled yearnings

Not troubled dear Edchen only so heartfelt so fervent in the depth
of my heartand so strangely mysterious to myself withal But this
with all belonging to me springs alike from the words and commands of
Aslauga How then can it be otherwise than something good and fair
and tending to a high and noble aim

A squire who had hastened after them announced that the knightly
bridegroom was expected for the torchdance and as they returned
Edwald entreated his friend to take his place in the solemn dance next
to him and Hildegardis Froda inclined his head in token of friendly
assent


The horns and hautboys had already sounded their solemn invitation
Edwald hastened to give his hand to his fair bride and while he
advanced with her to the midst of the stately hall Froda offered his
hand for the torchdance to a noble lady who stood the nearest to him
without farther observing her and took with her the next place to the
wedded pair

But how was it when a light began to beam from his companion before
which the torch in his left hand lost all its brightness Hardly dared
he in sweet and trembling hope to raise his eyes to the lady and when
at last he ventured all his boldest wishes and longings were fulfilled
Adorned with a radiant bridal crown of emeralds Aslauga moved in solemn
loveliness beside him and beamed on him from amid the sunny light of
her golden hair blessing him with her heavenly countenance The amazed
spectators could not withdraw their eyes from the mysterious pairthe
knight in his light silver mail with the torch raised on high in his
hand earnest and joyful moving with a measured step as if engaged in
a ceremony of deep and mysterious meaning His lady beside him rather
floating than dancing beaming light from her golden hair so that you
would have thought the day was shining into the night and when a look
could reach through all the surrounding splendour to her face rejoicing
heart and sense with the unspeakably sweet smile of her eyes and lips

Near the end of the dance she inclined towards Froda and whispered to
him with an air of tender confidence and with the last sound of the
horns and hautboys she had disappeared

The most curious spectator dared not question Froda about his partner
Hildegardis did not seem to have been conscious of her presence but
shortly before the end of the festival Edwald approached his friend and
asked in a whisper Was it

Yes dear youth answered Froda your marriagedance has been
honoured by the presence of the most exalted beauty which has been ever
beheld in any land Ah and if I rightly understood her meaning you
will never more see me stand sighing and gazing upon the ground But
hardly dare I hope it Now goodnight dear Edchen goodnight As soon
as I may I will tell you all




CHAPTER IX



The light and joyous dreams of morning still played round Edwalds head
when it seemed as though a clear light encompassed him He remembered
Aslauga but it was Froda the golden locks of whose helmet shone now
with no less sunny brightness than the flowing hair of his lady Ah
thought Edwald in his dream how beautiful has my brotherinarms
become And Froda said to him I will sing something to you Edchen
but softly softly so that it may not awaken Hildegardis Listen to me


 She glided in bright as the day
 There where her knight in slumber lay
 And in her lily hand was seen
 A band that seemed of the moonlight sheen
 We are one she sang as about his hair
 She twined it and over her tresses fair
 Beneath them the world lay dark and drear
 But he felt the touch of her hand so dear
 Uplifting him far above mortals sight
 While around him were shed her locks of light
 Till a garden fair lay about him spread
 And this was Paradise angels said


Never in your life did you sing so sweetly said the dreaming Edwald

That may well be Edchen said Froda with a smile and vanished

But Edwald dreamed on and on and many other visions passed before him
all of a pleasing kind although he could not recall them when in the
full light of morning he unclosed his eyes with a smile Froda alone
and his mysterious song stood clear in his memory He now knew full
well that his friend was dead but the thought gave him no pain for he
felt sure that the pure spirit of that minstrelwarrior could only find
its proper joy in the gardens of Paradise and in blissful solace with
the lofty spirits of the ancient times He glided softly from the side
of the sleeping Hildegardis to the chamber of the departed He lay upon
his bed of rest almost as beautiful as he had appeared in the dream
and his golden helmet was entwined with a wondrouslyshining lock of
hair Then Edwald made a fair and shady grave in consecrated ground
summoned the chaplain of the castle and with his assistance laid his
beloved Froda therein

He came back just as Hildegardis awoke she beheld with wonder and
humility his mien of chastened joy and asked him whither he had been
so early to which he replied with a smile I have just buried the
corpse of my dearlyloved Froda who this very night has passed away
to his goldenhaired mistress Then he related the whole history of
Aslaugas Knight and lived on in subdued unruffled happiness though
for some time he was even more silent and thoughtful than before He
was often found sitting on the grave of his friend and singing the
following song to his lute


 Listening to celestial lays
 Bending thy unclouded gaze
 On the pure and living light
 Thou art blest Aslaugaa Knight

 Send us from thy bower on high
 Many an angelmelody
 Many a vision soft and bright
 Aslaugas dear and faithful Knight

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support
