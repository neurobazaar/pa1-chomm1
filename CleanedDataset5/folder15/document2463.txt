THE PROPHET OF BERKELEY SQUARE

By Robert Hichens




CHAPTER I

MRS MERILLIA IS CARRIED TO BED

The great telescope of the Prophet was carefully adjusted upon its
lofty brassbound stand in the bow window of Number One Thousand
Berkeley Square It pointed towards the remarkably bright stars which
twinkled in the December sky over frosty London those guardian stars
which always seemed to the Prophet to watch with peculiar solicitude
over the most respectable neighbourhood in which he resided The
polestar had its eye even now upon the mansion of an adjacent
expremier the belt of Orion was not oblivious of a belted earls cosy
redbrick home just opposite and the house of a certain famous actor
and actress close by had been taken by the Great Bear under its special
protection

The Prophets butler Mr Ferdinandthat bulky and veracious
gentlemanthrew open the latticed windows of the drawingroom and
let the cold air rush blithely in Then he made up the fire carefully
placed a copy of Mr Malkiels _Almanac_ bound in dull pink and silver
brocade by Miss Clorinda Dolbrett of the Cromwell Road upon a
small tulipwood table near the telescope patted a sofa cushion
affectionately on the head glanced around with the meditative eye of
the butler born not made and quitted the comfortable apartment with a
salaried but soft footstep

It was a pleasant chamber this drawingroom of Number One Thousand It
spoke respectfully of the generations that were past and seemed serenely
certain of a comfortable future There was no too modern uneasiness
about it no trifling gimcrack furniture constructed to catch the eye
and the angles of any one venturing to seek repose upon it no unmeaning
rubbish of ornaments or hectic flummery of secondrate pictures Above
the high oaken mantelpiece was a little pure bust in marble of the
Prophet when a small boy To right and left were pretty miniatures in
golden frames of the Prophets delightfully numerous grandmothers Here
might be seen Mrs Prothero the great shipbuilders faithful wife in
blue brocade and Lady Camptown who reigned at Bath in grey tabinet
and diamond buckles when Miss Jane Austen was writing her first
romance Mrs Susan Burlington who knew Lord Byrona remarkable
factand Lady Sophia Green who knew her own mind a fact still more
remarkable The lastnamed lady wore black with a Roman nose and the
combination was admirably convincing Here might also be observed Mrs
Stuefitt Mistress of the Mazurka and the Lady Jane Follington of
whom George the Second had spoken openly in terms of approbation She
affected plum colour and had eyes like sloesthe fashionable hue in
the neatfootandprettyankle period The flames of the fire twinkled
brightly over this battalion of deuced fine women who were all without
one exception the grandmothersin various degreesof the Prophet
When speaking of them in the highest terms he never differentiated
them by the adjectives great or greatgreat They were all kind and
condescending enough to be his grandmothers For a man of his sensitive
delicate and grateful disposition this was enough He thought them all
quite perfect and took them all under the protection of his soft and
beaming eyes

Of Mrs Merillia the live grandmother with whom he had the great
felicity to dwell in Berkeley Square he seldom said anything in
public praise The incense he offered at her shrine rose most sweetly
perfumed from his daily life The hearth of this agreeable and
grandmotherly chamber was attractive with dogs the silver cage beside
it with green lovebirds Upon the floor was a heavy dullblue carpet
over whichas has been intimatedeven a butler so heavy as Mr
Ferdinand could go softly The walls were dressed with a dull blue paper
that looked like velvet

Here and there upon them hung a picture a landscape of George Morland
lustily English a Cotman a Cuypcows in twilighta Reynolds faded
but exquisitely genteel A lovely little harpsichordmeditating on
Scarlattistood in one angle a harp tied with most delicate ribands
of ivory satin powdered with pimpernels in another Many waxen
candles shed a tender and unostentatious radiance above their careful
greasecatchers Upon pretty tables lay neat books by Fanny Burney
Beatrice Harraden Mary Wilkins and Max Beerbohm also the poems of
Lord Byron and of Lord de Tabley Near the hearth was a sofa on which an
emperor might have laid an easy head that wore a crown and before every
low and seductive chair was set a low and seductive footstool

A grandmothers clock pronounced the hour of ten in a frail and
elegant voice as the finelycarved oak door was opened and the
Prophet seriously entered this peaceful room carrying a copy of the
_Meditations of Marcus Aurelius_ in his hand

He was a neatlymade little man of fashionable even of modish cut
spare smart and whimsical with a cleanshaved smallfeatured face
large shining brown eyes abundant and slightlywaving brown hair that
could only be parted with the sweetest sorrow in the centre of
his wellshaped almost philosophical head and movements light and
temperate as those of a meditative squirrel Having just dined he was
naturally in evening dress with a butterfly tie gleaming pumps and
a buttonhole of violets He shut the door gently glanced at his
nicelooking grandmothers and walking forward very quietly and
demurely applied his eye to the telescope lowering himself slightly
by a Sandow exercise which he had practised before he became a prophet
Having remained in this position of astronomical observation for some
minutes he deviated into the upright closed the window and tinkled
a small silver bell that stood on the tulipwood table beside Malkiels
_Almanac_

Mr Ferdinand appeared looking respectfully buoyant

Has Mr Malkiel sent any reply to my inquiry Mr Ferdinand asked the
Prophet

He has not sir replied Mr Ferdinand sympathetically

Did the boy messenger say he delivered my note

He said so sir on his Bible oath sir

And do you believe him

Oh sir responded Mr Ferdinand in a shocked voice surely a London
lad would not be found to tell a lie

I hope not Mr Ferdinand Stilldid he look a nervous sort of lad

He was a trifle pale sir about the gillsbut a heart of gold sir I
feel sure He wore four medals sir

Four medals Nevertheless he may have been frightened to go to Mr
Malkiels door That will do Mr Ferdinand

Mr Ferdinand was about to bow and retire when the Prophet after a
moment of hesitation added

Stay Mr Ferdinand Mrs Merillia has gone to the Gaiety Theatre
tonight I expect her back at halfpast eleven She may need assistance
on her return

Assistance sir Mrs Merillia sir

Mr Ferdinands luminous eyes shone with amazement

She mayI say she _may_have to be carried to bed

Mr Ferdinands jaw dropped He gave at the knees and was obliged to
cling to a Chippendale cabinet for support

Have an armchair ready in the hall in case of necessity and tell
Gustavus to sit up Mrs Merillia must not be dropped You understand
That will do Mr Ferdinand

Mr Ferdinand endeavoured to bow and ultimately succeeded in retiring
When his tremulous shoulders were no longer visible the Prophet opened
Marcus Aurelius and seating himself in a corner of the big couch by
the fire crossed his legs one over the other and began to read that
timid Ancients consolatory but unconvincing remarks Occasionally he
paused however murmured doubtfully Will she have to be carried to
bed shook his head mournfully and then resumed his reading

While he thus employs his time we must say a word or two about him

Mr Hennessey Vivian was now a man of thirtyeight of excellent
fortune of fine connections and of admirable disposition He had
become an orphan as soon as it was in his power to do so having lost
his fatherCaptain Vivian of Her Majestys Tenth Lancerssome months
before and his motherwho had been a Merillia of Chipping Sudburya
few minutes after his birth In these unfortunate circumstances over
which he poor infant had absolutely no controlwhatever unkind people
might sayhe devolved upon his mothers mother the handsome and
popular Mrs Merillia who assumed his charge with the rosy alacrity
characteristic of her in all her undertakings With her the little
Hennessey had passed his infantine years blowing happy bubbles
presiding over the voyages of his own private Noahfrom the Army
and Navy Stores with two hundred animals of both sexeseating pap
prepared by Mrs Merillias own _chef_ and sleeping in a cot hung with
sunny silk that might have curtained Venus or have shaken about Aurora
as she rose in the first morning of the world From her he had acquired
the alphabet and many a gingernut and decorative bonbon And from her
too he had set forth with tears in his new Eton jacket and broad
white collar to go to Mr Chapmans preparatory school for little boys
at Slough Here he remained for several years acquiring a respect for
the poet Gray and a love of Slough peppermint that could only cease
with life Here too he made friends with Robert Green son of Lord
Churchmore who was afterwards to be a certain influence in his life
His existence at Slough was happy Indeed so great was his affection
for the place that his removal to Eton cost him suffering scarcely less
acute than that which presently attended his departure from Eton to
Christchurch Over his sensations on leaving Oxford we prefer to draw a
veil only saying that his last outlookas an undergraduateover her
immemorial towers was as hazy as the average Cabinet Ministers outlook
over the events of the day and the desires of the community

But if the moisture of the Prophet did him credit at that painful period
of his life it must be allowed that his behaviour on being formally
introduced into London Society showed no puling regret no backward
longings after echoing colleges lost dons and the scouts that are no
more He was quite at his ease and displayed none of the highpitched
contempt of Piccadilly that is often so amusingly characteristic of the
young gentlemen accustomed to the High

Mrs Merillia who had been a widow ever since she could remember
possessed the lease of the house in Berkeley Square in which the
Prophet was now sitting It was an excellent mansion with everything
comfortable about it a duke on one side a Chancellor of the Exchequer
on the other electric light several bathrooms and the gramophone
There was never any question of the Prophet setting up house by himself
On leaving Oxford he joined his ample fortune to Mrs Merillias as
a matter of course and they settled down together with the greatest
alacrity and hopefulness Nor were their pleasant relations once
disturbed during the fifteen years that elapsed before the Prophet
applied his eye to the telescope in the bow window and gave Mr
Ferdinand the instructions which have just been recorded

These fifteen years had not gone by without leaving their mark upon our
hero He had done several things during their passage For instance
he had written a play very nearly proposed to the third daughter of
a London clergyman and twice been to the Derby Such events had not
unnaturally had their effect upon the formation of his character and
even upon the expression of his intelligent face The writing of
the playand perhaps its refusal by all the actormanagers of the
townhad traced a tiny line at each corner of his mobile mouth The
third daughter of the London clergymanhis sentiment for herhad
taught his hand the slightly episcopal gesture which was so admired at
the Lambeth Palace Garden Party in the summer of 1892 And the great
race meeting was responsible for the rather tight trousers and the
gentlemanjockey smile which he was wont to assume when he set out for a
canter in the Row From all this it will be guessed that our Prophet was
exceedingly amenable to the influences that throng at the heels of the
human destiny Indeed he was And some few months before this story
opens it came about that he encountered a gentleman who was in fact
the primary cause of this story being true Who was this gentleman you
will say Sir Tiglath Butt the great astronomer Correspondent of
the Institute of France Member of the Royal College of Science
Demonstrator of Astronomical Physics author of the pamphlet
StarGazers and the brochure An investigation into the psychical
condition of those who see stars CBFRS and popular member of the
Colley Cibber Club in Long Acre

The Prophet was introduced to Sir Tiglath at the Colley Cibber Club and
though Sir Tiglath who was of a freakish disposition and much addicted
to his joke declined to speak to him on the ground that he Sir
Tiglath had lost his voice and was unlikely to find it in conversation
the Prophet was greatly impressed by the astronomers enormous brickred
face round body turned legs eyes like marbles and capacity for
drinking portwineso much so in fact that on leaving the club he
hastened to buy a science primer on astronomy and devoted himself for
several days to a minute investigation of the Milky Way

As there is a fascination of the earth so is there a fascination of the
heavens Along the dim empurpled highways that lead from star to star
from meteorite to comet the imagination travels wakefully by night and
the heart leaps as it draws near to the silver bosses of the moon
Mrs Merillia was soon obliged to permit the intrusion of a gigantic
telescope into her pretty drawingroom and found herself expected to
converse at the dinnertable on the eight moons of Saturn the belts of
Jupiter the asteroids of Mars and the phases of Venus These last
she at first declined to discuss with a man even though he were her
grandson But she was won over by the Prophets innocent persuasiveness
and drawn on until she spoke almost as readily of the movements of the
stars as formerly she had spoken of the movements of the Court from
Windsor to London and from London to Balmoral In truth she expected
that Hennesseys passion for the comets would cease as had ceased his
passion for the clergymans daughter that his ardour for astronomy
would die as had died his ardour for playwriting that he would give up
going to _Corona Borealis_ and to the Southern Fish as he had given up
going to the Derby Time proved her wrong As the days flew Hennessey
became increasingly impassioned He was more often at the telescope than
at the Bachelors and seemed on the way to become almost as gibbous as
the planet Mars Even he slightly neglected his social duties and on
one terrible occasion forgot that he was engaged to dine at Cambridge
House because he was assisting at a transit of Mercury

Now all this began to weigh upon the mind of Mrs Merillia despite the
amazing cheerfulness of disposition which she had inherited from two
long lines of confirmed optimistsher ancestors on the paternal and
maternal sides She did not know how to brood but if she had she
might well have been led to do so And even as it was she had been
reduced to so unusual a condition of dejection that a week before the
evening we are describing she had been obliged to order a box at the
Gaiety Theatre she who like all optimists habitually frequented
those playhouses where she could behold gloomy tragedies awful
melodramas or those ironic pieces called farces in which the ultimate
misery of which human nature is capable is drawn to its farthest point

In the beginning of this new dejection of hers Mrs Merillia was now
seated in a stage box at the Gaiety with an elderly General of Life
Guards a Mistress of the Robes and the grandfather of the Central
American Ambassador at the Court of St James and all four of them
were smiling at a neat little low comedian who was singing without any
voice and with the utmost precision a pathetic romance entitled De
Coon Wot Got de Chuck

Meanwhile the Prophet was engaged for the twentieth time in considering
whether Mrs Merillia on her return from this festival would have to
be carried to bed by hired menials

Why

This brings us to the great turning point in our heros life to the
point when first he began to respect the strange powers stirring within
him

Until he encountered Sir Tiglath Butt in the diningroom of the Colley
Cibber Club Hennessey had been but a dilettante fellow He had written a
play but airily and without the twenty years of arduous and persistent
study declared by the dramatic critics to be absolutely necessary before
any intelligent man can learn how to get a bishop on or a chambermaid
off the stage He had nearly proposed to a clergymans daughter but
thoughtlessly and without any previous examination into the clericalism
of rectory females any firsthand knowledge of mothers meetings
devoid of which he must be a stouthearted gentleman who would rush in
where even curates often fear to tread He had been to the Derby but
without wearing a bottlegreen veil or carrying a bettingbook In fact
he had not taken life very seriously or fully appreciated the solemn
duties it brings to all who bear its yoke Only when the plump red hand
of Sir Tiglathholding a bumper of thirtyfour portpointed the way
to the heavens did Hennessey beginthrough his telescopeto see the
great possibilities that foot it about the existence of even the meanest
man who eats drinks and suffers For through his telescope he saw that
he might be a prophet Malkiel read the future in the stars Why not he

He endeavoured to do so He sought an intimacy with the benefic
_Jupiter_ and found itperhaps by a secret kowtowing to
_Sagittarius_ He made up openly to _Canis Major_ and was shortly on
what might almost be considered terms of affection with _Venus_ And
he was moreover presently quite fearless in the presence of _Saturn_
quite unabashed beneath the glittering eye of _Mercury_ Then as the
neophyte growing bold by familiarity with the circle of the great ones
he ventured on his first prophecy a discreet and even humble forecast
of the weather He predicted a heavy fall of snow for a certain evening
and so distrusted his own prediction that when the evening came mild
and benign he sallied forth to the Empire Palace of Varieties and
stayed till near midnight laughing at the sallies of French clowns and
applauding the frail antics of cockatoos on motor bicycles When on the
stroke of twelve he came airily forth wrapped in the lightest of dust
coats he was obliged to endure the greatest of mans amazementsthe
knowledge that there was a well of truth within him Leicester Square
was swathed in an ivory fleece and he was obliged to gain Berkeley
Square on foot treading gingerly in pumps escorted by linkmen with
flaring golden torches and preceded by tipsy but assiduous ruffians
armed with shovels who with many a lusty oath and horrid imprecation
cleared a thin thread of path between the towering walls of snow that
sparkled faintly in the gaslight

This experience fired him He rose up early lay down late and quite
with her assent cast the horoscope of Mrs Merillia in the sweat of his
brow He cast we say her horoscope and from a certain conjunction of
the planets he gathered to his horror that upon the fifteenth day of
the month of January she would suffer an accident while on an evening
jaunt We find him now on this fifteenth day of the first month aware
of his revered grandmothers intrepid expedition to the Gaiety Theatre
waiting her return to Berkeley Square with mingled feelings which we
might analyse for pages but which we prefer baldly to state

He longed to be proved indeed a prophet and he longed also to see his
beloved relative return from her sheaf of pleasures in the free and
unconstrained use of all her graceful limbs He was therefore torn
by foes in a mental conflict and was in no case to sip the philosophic
honey of Marcus Aurelius as he sat between the telescope and the fire in
the comfortable drawingroom awaiting his grandmothers return

Gustavus said Mr Ferdinand in the servants hall to the flushed
footman who lay upon a whatnot sipping a glass of ale and reading a
new and unabridged farthing edition of Carlyles _French Revolution_
Gustavus Mrs Merillia has been and gone to the Gaiety Theatre
tonight We expect her back at eleventhirty sharp She may need
assistance on her return Gustavus

The footman put down the tumbler which he was in the act of raising to
his pouted lips

Assistance Mr Ferdinand he ejaculated Mrs Merillia Mr
Ferdinand

She maywe say she _may_have to be carried to bed Gustavus

Gustavuss jaw dropped and the _French Revolution_ fluttered in his
startled hands

Good lawks Mr Ferdinand he exclaimed not quoting from Carlyle

Have an armchair ready in the hall Gustavus Mrs Merillia must not be
dropped You understand That will do Gustavus

And Mr Ferdinand passed to the adjacent suppertable to join the upper
housemaid in a discussion of two subjects that were very near to their
hearts a round of beef and a tureen of pickled cabbage while Gustavus
got up from the whatnot in a bemused manner and proceeded to search
dreamily for an armchair He came upon one by chance in the diningroom
and wheeled it out into the hall just as the clocks in the house rang
out the halfhour after eleven

The Prophet above sprang up from the couch by the fire Mr Ferdinand
below closed his discussion with the upper housemaid and the former
rapidly came down the latter up stairs as the roll of wheels broke
through the silence of the square

Gustavus in an attitude of bridled curiosity was posed beneath a polar
bear that held an electric lamp His hand was laid upon the back of the
armchair and his round hazel eyes were turned expectantly towards the
hall as his two masters joined him

Is all ready Mr Ferdinand said the Prophet anxiously

All is ready sir replied the butler

Wheel the chair forward Gustavus if you please said the Prophet
Mrs Merillia must not be dropped Remember that

Not be dropped sirno

The chair ran forward on its amicable castors as a carriage was heard
to stop outside Mr Ferdinand flung open the portal and the Prophet
glided out excitedly upon the step

Well he cried well

A footman in a long drab coat with red facings was preparing to get
off the box of a smart brougham but before he could reach the pavement
a charming head covered with a lace cap was thrust out of the window
and a musical and almost girlish voice cried

All nonsense Hennessey all rubbish Saturn dont know what hes
talkin about Look

The carriage door was vivaciously opened from the inside and a
delightful little old lady dressed in brown silk with a long cheerful
pointed nose rosy cheeks and chestnut hairthat almost mightnt have
been a wig in certain lightsprepared to leap forth without waiting for
the reverent assistance that the Prophet flanked by Mr Ferdinand and
Gustavus was in waiting to afford

As she jumped she began to cry Not much wrong with me is there
Hennessey but before the sentence was completed she had caught her
neat foot in her brown silk gown had stumbled from the step of the
carriage to the pavement had twisted her pretty ankle had reeled and
almost fallen had been caught by the Prophet and Mr Ferdinand borne
tenderly into the hall and placed in the armchair which the terrified
Gustavus with almost enraged ardour drove forward to receive her As
she sank down in it helpless Mrs Merillia exclaimed with unabated
vivacity

Its happened Hennessey its happened But it was my own doin and
yours You shouldnt have prophesied at your age and I shouldnt have
jumped at mine

Dearest grannie cried the Prophet on his knees beside her how
grieved how shocked I am Is itis it

Sprained Hennessey

He nodded Mechanically Mr Ferdinand nodded Gustavus let his powdered
head drop too in imitation of his superiors

Ill tell you in the drawinroom

She placed her pretty mittened hands upon the arms of the chair and
gave a little wriggle trying to get up Then she cried out musically

No I must be carried up Mr Ferdinand

Maam

Is Gustavus to be trusted

Trusted maam cried Mr Ferdinand looking at Gustavus who had
assumed an expression of pale and pathetic dignity Trusteda London
footman Oh maam

His voice failed He choked and began to rummage in the pocket of his
black tail coat for his perfumed handkerchief

Tst tst I mean his arms said Mrs Merillia patting her delicate
hands quickly on the chair Can he carry me

The countenance of Mr Ferdinand cleared while Gustavus eagerly
extended his right arm bent it sharply and allowed his magnificent
biceps to rise up in sudden majesty Mrs Merillia was reassured

Hoist me to the drawinroom then she said Hennessey will you
walk behind

The procession was formed and the little old lady proceeded by a
succession of jerks to the upper floor her silk gown rustling against
the balusters and her tiny feet dangling loosely in midair while
her long and elegant head nodded each time Mr Ferdinand and Gustavus
pranced carefully sideways to a higher step The Prophet followed
solicitously behind with hands outstretched to check any dangerous
recoil His face was very grave but not entirely unhappy

Set me down by the fire said Mrs Merillia when she found herself
being smoothly propelled through the atmosphere of the drawingroom

The menials obeyed with breathless assiduity

And now bring me a sandwich a glass of toast and water and a fan if
you please Yes put the footstool well under me

Dearest grannie said the Prophet when the men had retired are you
in great pain

No Hennessey Are you

Mrs Merillias green eyes twinkled

I

Yes at my accident For my ankle is sprained Im almost sure and I
shall have to lie up presently in wet bandages Tell me are you really
pained that I have had the accident you prophesied

She glanced from her grandson to the telescope that pointed toward the
stars and back again

I am indeed sincerely grieved the Prophet answered with genuine
emotion

Yes But if Id jumped out all right and was sittin here now in a
perfect condition of health youd have been sincerely grieved too

I hope not grannie said the Prophet But he looked meditative

Mr Ferdinand brought the toast and water the sandwich and the fan
When he had trodden across the carpet out of the room Mrs Merillia
continued

Hennessey you see where this prophetic business is leadin you It has
made you charmed at my accident Yes it has

She spoke without any pathos humorously indeed in a bright tone full
of common sense And she nodded at him over her toast and water with a
chaffing demure smile But the Prophet winced and put his hand to his
thick brown hair

No no he cried quickly Thats impossible It cant be But the
statements sounded like perturbed questions

Think said his grandmother looking down at her poor helpless foot
as it lay on the velvet stool If I hadnt had an accident tonight
youd have been obliged to think ill ofofwhich of them was it that
had the impertinence to talk my affairs over with you

Mercury and Uranus Jupiter Saturn and Venus said the Prophet with
almost terrible gravity

Exactly I always have thought ill of the last but thats nothin to
do with it Weigh me in the balance against five planetsare they all
planetsand how do the scales go You see Hennessey

The Prophet looked much distressed He saw his beloved grandmother by
the fire and the bright stars twinkling through the frosty windowpanes
He thought of his telescope of Sir Tiglath of Mr Malkiel and of the
future and the velvety blue walls of the drawingroom seemed to spin
round him

Prophecy continued Mrs Merillia fanning herself till the lace
lappets of her priceless cap fluttered above her orderly and clasping
wig is dangerous for often it can cause its own fulfilment If
you hadnt said that because of a certain conjunction of planetsor
whatever it wasin my horoscope I should have an accident tonight I
shouldnt have jumped out of the brougham I should have waited for Mr
Ferdinand to assist me as befits a gentlewoman

But grannie I assure you I was most anxious to save you I hoped I
had made a mistake in your horoscope I did really I was so nervous
that I sent to Mr Malkiel while you were at the theatre and implored
him to look into the matter as an expert

Mr Malkiel Who is he Do we know him

No But we know his marvellous _Almanac_

The _Almanac_ person Why Malkiel is surely a myth Hennessey a
number of people a company a syndicate or something of that kind

So I thought grannie But I have made inquiriesthrough a detective
agencyand I have discovered that he is one person in fact a man
just like you and me

Rather an odd man then Is he in the Red Book

No He is I understand of a very retiring and secretive disposition
In fact I have had great difficulty in learning anything about him But
at length I have discovered that he receives and answers letters at an
address in London

Indeed Where is it

Jellybrands Library Eleven Hundred Z Shaftesbury Avenue I sent a
boy messenger there today

Did you receive a reply

No I think the boyalthough Mr Ferdinand tells me he wore four
medals I presume for couragemust have become nervous on perceiving
Mr Malkiels name on the envelope have thrown the note down a grating
and bolted before he reached the place though he saidon his Bible
oath I understand from Mr Ferdinandhe delivered the note In any
case I got no answer How are you feeling

Twisted but prophetic I foretell that my ankle will be swelled beyond
recognition tomorrow Help me to bed Hennessey

The Prophet flew to his dear relatives assistance and Mrs Merillia
endeavoured to rise and to lean upon his anxious arm After a struggle
however in which the Prophet took part and two chairs were overset she
was obliged to desist

You must ring the bell Hennessey she said Mr Ferdinand and
Gustavus must carry me to bed in the chair

The Prophet sprang tragically to the bell It was answered The
procession was reformed and Mrs Merillia was carried to bed still
smiling nodding at each stair and bearing herself with admirable
courage

As Mr Ferdinand and Gustavus descended to the basement after the
completion of their unusual task the latter said solemnly

However should master have come to know as the missis wouldnt be able
to put foot to floor this night Mr Ferdinand However

I cannot answer you Gustavus Mr Ferdinand replied shaking his
broad and globelike head round whose bald cupola the jetblack hair
was brushed in two half moons decorated with a renowned butlers own
special pomade

Well Mr Ferdinand rejoined Gustavus stretching out one hand for
pale ale the other for _French Revolution_ I dont like it

Why Gustavus inquired Mr Ferdinand preparing to resume his
discussion with the accommodating upper housemaid Why

Because it seems strange like Mr Ferdinand said Gustavus lifting
the glass to his lips the _French Revolution_ to his eyes

It do seem strange Gustavus answered Mr Ferdinand leaving out the
like in a cultivated manner It do

In the drawingroom the Prophet stood with clenched hands gazing
through the telescope at Mercury and Uranus Jupiter Saturn and
Venus while on the second floor Mrs Fancy Quinglet Mrs Merillias
devoted but occasionally disconcerting maid swathed her mistresss
ankle in bandages previously steeped in cold water and in vinegar



CHAPTER II

MALKIEL THE SECOND IS BETRAYED BY THE YOUNG LIBRARIAN

Mrs Merillias accident made a very deep impression upon the Prophets
mind He thought it over carefully and desired to discuss it in all its
bearings with Mrs Fancy Quinglet who had been his confidante for full
thirty years Mrs Fancywho had not been marriedwas no longer a
pretty girl Indeed it was possible that she had never even in her
heyday been otherwise than moderately plain Now at the age of
fiftyone and a half she was a faithful creature with a thin
pendulous nose a pale hysteric eye a tendency to cold in the head
and chilblains in the autumn of the year and a somewhat incoherent and
occasionally frenzied turn of mind Argument could never at any time
have had much effect upon her nature and as she grew towards maturity
its power over her most markedly decreased This fact was recognised
by everybody last of all by Mrs Merillia who was at length fully
convinced of the existence of certain depths in her maids peculiar
character by the following circumstance

Mrs Merillia had a bandylegged dachshund called Beau whose name was
for many years often affectionately and quite correctly pronounced
by Fancy Quinglet One day however she chanced to see it written upon
paperBEAU

Whatever does that mean maam she asked of Mrs Merillia

Why Beau of course Beauthe dog What should it mean

Bow cried Fancy Is he writ so

Of course silly girl It is written Beau and you can pronounce it as
you would pronounce a bow of ribbon

Fancy said no more though it was easy to see that she was much shaken
by this circumstance But she could never afterwards be induced to utter
her favourites name She was physically unable to speak the word so
strangely so almost impiously spelt This she declared with tears
Persuasion and argument were unavailing Henceforth Beau was always
called by her the dog and it was obvious that had she been led
out to the stake she must have burned rather than save herself by a
pronouncing of the combination of letters by which she had been so long
deceived

Such an inflexible mind had Mrs Fancy to whom the Prophet now applied
himself with gestures almost Sinaic

She was dressed in mousecoloured grenadine and was seated in a small
chamber opening out of Mrs Merillias bedroom engaged in what she
called plain tatting

Fancy said the Prophet entering and closing the door carefully you
know me well

From the bottle sir she answered darting the bone implements in and
out

Have you ever thoughthas it ever occurred to you

I cant say it has sir Fancy replied with the weak decision
peculiar to her

She was ever prone thus to answer questions before they were fully
asked or could be properly understood by her and from such premature
decisions as she hastened to give she could never afterwards be
persuaded to retreat Knowing this the Prophet said rapidly

Fancy if a man finds out that he is a prophet what ought he to do

The ladysmaid rattled her bones

Let it alone sir she answered Let it alone Master Hennessey

Well but what dyou mean by that

What I say sir I cant speak different nor mean other

But cant you explain Fancy

Oh Master Hennessey the lives that have been wrecked the homes that
have been broke up by explainings

Her eye seemed suddenly lit from within by some fever of sad worldly
knowledge

Well but the Prophet began

I know it Master Hennessey and I cant know other

She sighed and her gaze became fixed like that of a typhoid patient in
a dream

Them that knows other let them declare it she ejaculated I
say again as I did aforethe homes that have been broken up by
explainings

She tatted The Prophet bowed before her decision and left the apartment
feeling rather hungry Fancy Quinglets crumbs were not always crumbs
of comfort He resolved to apply again to Mr Malkiel and this time to
make the application in person But before he did so he thought it
right to tell Mrs Merillia who was still steeped in bandages of his
intention He therefore went straight to her room from Fancy Quinglets
Mrs Merillia was lying upon a couch reading a Russian novel A cup of
tea stood beside her upon a table near a bowl of red and yellow tulips
a canary was singing in its cage amid a shower of birdseed and the
dog lay stretched before the blazing fire upon a milkwhite rug over
which a pale ray of winter sunshine fell As the Prophet came in Mrs
Merillia glanced up

Hennessey she said you are growin to look like Lord Brandling
when he combined the Premiership with the Foreign Office and we had that
dreadful complication with Iceland My dear boy you are corrugated with
thought and care What is the matter My ankle is much better You
need not be anxious about me Has Venus been playing you another jades
trick

The Prophet sat down and stroked Beaus sable back with his forefinger

I have scarcely looked at Venus since you were injured grannie he
answered I have scarcely dared to

Im glad to hear it Since the days of Adonis she has always had a
dangerous influence on young men If you want to look at anybody look
at that pretty sensible cousin of Robert Greens

Lady Enid Yes she is sensible I believe she is in Hampshire staying
with the Churchmores

He looked calmer for a moment but the corrugated expression quickly
returned

Grannie he said I think it my duty to make an effort to see Mr
Malkiel

The _Almanac_ man What do you want with him

She tapped one of her small mittened hands over the other and slightly
twisted her long and pointed nose

I want to learn his views on this strange faculty of prophecy Has it
ever occurred to you that among all our immense acquaintance we dont
number a single prophet

One cant know everybody Hennessey And I believe that prophets always
spring from the lower classes The line must be drawn somewhere even in
these days

Why not draw it at millionaires then

I should like to Somethin will have to be done If the nobodies
continue to go everywhere the very few somebodies that are left will
soon go nowhere

Perhaps they do go nowhere Perhaps that is why we have never met a
prophet

Mrs Merillia looked up sharply with her wide cheerful mouth set awry
in a shrewd smile that seemed to say So ho She recognised a strange
new note of profound though not arrogant selfrespect in her grandson

Prophets Hennessey added more gently have always been inclined to
dwell in the wilderness

But where can you find a wilderness in these days asked Mrs
Merillia still smiling Even Hammersmith is becomin quite a
fashionable neighbourhood And you say that the _Almanac_ man lives in
Shaftesbury Avenue only half a minute from Piccadilly Circus

My dear grannie he corrected her I said he received letters there
I dont know where he lives

How are you goin to find him then

I shall call this afternoon at eleven hundred Z

To see if he has run in for a postcard And what sort of person do you
expect him to be

Something quite out of the common

Mrs Merillia screwed up her eyes doubtfully

I hope you wont be disappointed How many editions have there been of
the _Almanac_

Seventy yearly editions

Then Malkiel must be a very old man

But this Mr Malkiel is Malkiel the Second

One of a dynasty That alters the case Perhaps hes a young man about
town There are young men about town I believe who have addresses
at clubs and libraries and sleep on doorsteps or in the Park Well
Hennessey I see you are getting fidgety You had better be off Buy me
some roses for my room on your way home Im expectin someone to have
tea with the poor victim of prophecy this afternoon

The Prophet kissed his grandmother put on his overcoat and stepped into
the square

It was a bright frosty genial day and he resolved to walk to
Jellybrands Library

London was looking quite lighthearted in the dry cold air which set a
bloom even upon the cheeks of the ambassadors who were about and caused
the butcher boys to appear like peonies The crossingsweepers swept
nothing vigorously and were rewarded with showers of pence from
pedestrians delighting in the absence of mud Crystal as some garden
of an eternal city seemed the green Park wrapped in its frosty mantle
embroidered with sunbeams Even the drivers of the growlers were
moderately cheerfula very rare occurrenceand the blind man of
Piccadilly smiled as he roared along the highway striking the feet of
the charitable with the wand which was the emblem of his profession

Only the Prophet was solemn on this delicious afternoon People looked
at him and thought that he must surely be the richest man of the town
His face was so sad

He wound across the whirlpool where the green image postures to the
human streams that riot below it He saw beneath their rooves of ostrich
feathers the girls shake their long earrings above sweet violets and
roses fainting with desire to be bought by country cousins

Where is eleven hundred Z if you please he asked the Shaftesbury
Avenue policeman

Jellybrands sir On the right between the cream shop and the engine
warehouse just opposite the place where they sell parrots after that
there patent medicine depot

The Prophet bowed thinking of the blessings of knowledge In a moment
he stood before the library and glanced at its dirty window He saw
several letters lying against the glass One was addressed to Miss
Minerva Partridge He stepped in wondering what she was like

Jellybrands Library was a small square room containing a letter rack
a newspaper stand a bookcase and a counter It was fitted up with
letters papers books and a big boy with a bulging head The
lastnamed stood behind the counter stroking his irregular profile with
one hand and throwing a box of J nibs into the air and catching it with
the other Upon the Prophets entrance this youth obligingly dropped the
nibs accidentally upon the floor and arranged his sharp and anemic
face in an expression of consumptive inquiry The Prophet approached the
counter softly and allowed the sable with which his coat was trimmed to
rest against it

Did a boy messenger call here a few days ago with a note for Mr
Malkiel he asked

The young librarian assumed an attitude of vital suspicion and the
expression of a lynx

For Malkiel the Second sir he replied in a piercing soprano voice

Yes said the Prophet A boy messenger with four medals There was
a crest on the envelopean elephant rampant surrounded by a swarm of
bees

A dogged look of combined terror and resolution overspread the young
librarians countenance

Theres been no elephant and no swarm of bees in here he said with
trembling curtness

You are sure you would have remembered the circumstance if there had
been

Rather What do you think We dont allow things of them sort in here
I can tell you

The Prophet drew out half a sovereign upon which a ray of sunshine
immediately fell as if in benediction

Does Mr Malkiel

Malkiel the Second interrupted the young librarian whose pinkish
eyes winked at the illumination of the gold

Malkiel the Second ever call herein person

In person said the young librarian very suspiciously

Exactly

I dont know about in person He calls here

Ah said the Prophet recognising in the youth a literary sense that
instinctively rejected superfluity He does call May I ask when

When he chooses said the young librarian and he winked again

Does he choose often

Hes got his day like Miss Partridge and lots of em

I see Is his dayby chancea Thursday

It was a Thursday afternoon

I dont know about by chance rejoined the young librarian his
literary sense again coming into play But its

At this moment the library door opened and a tall thin middleaged
man walked in sideways with his feet very much turned out to right and
left of him

Any letters Frederick Smith he said in a hollow voice on reaching
the counter

Two Mr Sagittarius I believe replied the young librarian moving
with respectful celerity towards the letter rack

The Prophet started and looked eagerly at the newcomer His eyes rested
upon an individual whose face was comic in outline with a serious
expression and whose form suggested tragic farce dressed to represent
commonplace as seen at Margate and elsewhere A top hat a spotted
collar a pink shirt a white satin tie a chocolate brown frock coat
brown trousers and boots and a black overcoat thrown open from top to
bottomthese appurtenances clerkly in their adherence to a certain
convention could not wholly disguise the emotional expression that
seems sometimes to lurk in shape The lines of Mr Sagittarius defied
their clothing His shoulders gave the lie to the chocolate brown frock
coat His legs breathed defiance to the trousers that sheathed them
One could in fancy see the former shrugged in all the abandonment
of thirdact despair behold the latter darting wildly for the cover
afforded by a copper a cupboard or any other friendly refuge of those
poor victims of ludicrous and terrific circumstance who are so sorely
smitten and afflicted upon the funny stage

Mr Sagittarius in fine seemed a man dressed in a mask that was unable
to deceive His lean face was almost absurd in its irregularity its
high cheekbones and deep depressions its sharp nose extensive mouth
and nervous chin But the pale blue eyes that were its soul shone
plaintively beneath their shaggy blonde eyebrows and even an
application of pomade almost hysterically lavish could not entirely
conceal the curling gloom of the heavy matted hair

Yes two Mr Sagittarius cried the young librarian approaching from
the rack

The gentleman held out a hand covered with a yellow dogskin glove

Thank you Frederick Smith he said

And he turned to leave the building But the Prophet intercepted him

Excuse me said the Prophet I beg your pardon butbut he looked
at the young librarian and accidentally let the half sovereign fall on
the counter It gave the true ring I believe I heard you mentionlet
drop the name Mr Sagittarius

I dont know about let drop began the youth in his usual revising
manner But I

At this point the gentleman in question began to move rather hastily
sideways towards the door The Prophet followed him up and got before
him near the letter rack while the young librarian retrieved the half
sovereign and bit it with his teeth

I really beg your pardon said the Prophet while Mr Sagittarius
stood still in the violent attitude of one determined to dodge so long
as he has breath I am not at all in the habit ofMr Sagittarius
dodgedof intruding upon strangers Mr Sagittarius dodged again
with such extraordinary abruptness and determination that he nearly
caused the young librarian to swallow the Prophets golden bribe I see
you dont believe me the Prophet continued flushing pink but still
holding his ground and indeed trying to turn Mr Sagittariuss flank by
a strategic movement of almost military precision I see that plainly
but Mr Sagittarius ducked to the left endeavouring to cover the
manoeuvre by an almost simultaneous and extremely passionate feint
towards the Prophets centre which was immediately withdrawn in good
orderbut your remarkarkable name Saagittittarius suggested to
me that you are reaeally the man I seek

He had now got Mr Sagittarius into a very awkward bit of country
between the letter P in the rack under which reposed Miss Partridges
correspondence and the newspaper bureau with the counter immediately
on his rear and taking advantage of this circumstance he continued
rapidly

May I ask whether you recently received a letterone
momentenvelopecrestI only want to know if you have
receivedonlyan elephant rampantswarm ofof bees

I have never received a rampant elephant and a swarm of bees cried
Mr Sagittarius with every symptom of unbridled terror Help Frederick
Smith

Right you are Malkiel the Second cried the young librarian hastily
pocketing the half sovereign and making a feverish lunge at nothing in
particular over the counter Right you are

Malkiel the Second ejaculated the Prophet Then you are the man I
seek

Malkiel the Secondfor it was indeed hesank back against the counter
in an attitude of abandoned prostration that would have made a fortune
of a comic actor

I trusted to Jellybrands he said drawing from his tail pocket a
white handkerchief covered with a pattern of pink storks in flight I
trusted to Jellybrands and Jellybrands has betrayed me Oh Frederick
Smith

He put a stork to each eye The young librarian assumed an injured air

It was the agitation did it Mr Sagittarius he said If you hadnt
akep dodging I shouldnt have lost my memory

And he looked avariciously at the Prophet who smiled at him
reassuringly and drew forth a card case

I feel sure Mr SagMalkiel

Malkiel the Second sir is my name if it is betrayed by Jellybrands
said that gentleman with sudden dignity There is no need of any
mister

I beg your pardon said the Prophet handing his card That is my
name and address May I beg you to forgive my apparent anxiety to make
your acquaintance and implore you to grant me a few moments of private
conversation on a matter of the utmost importance

Malkiel the Second read the card

Berkeley Square he said _The_ Berkeley Square

Exactly the Berkeley Square said the Prophet modestly

Not the one at Brixton Rise behind the Kimminss mews said Malkiel
the Second suspiciously

Certainly not The one near Grosvenor Square

Thats better said Malkiel upon whom the Prophets address had
evidently made a good impression Kimminss is no class at all Had you
come from there Ibut what may you want with me

The Prophet glanced significantly at the young librarian who was
leaning upon the counter in a tense keyhole position with his private
ear turned somewhat ostentatiously towards the two speakers

I can tell you in an inner room he murmured in his most ingratiating
manner

Youre certain its not Berkeley Square behind Kimminss said
Malkiel with a last flicker of suspicion

Quite certainquite

Frederick Smith said Malkiel the Second since Jellybrands
has betrayed me Jellybrands must abide the consequences Show this
gentleman and me to the parlour

Right Mr Sagittarius replied the young librarian whose memory had
again become excellent But Miss Minerva is coming at threethirty

Has she bespoke the parlour Frederick Smith

Yes Mr Sagittarius

Then she cant have it Thats all Jellybrands must abide the full
consequences of my betrayal Go forward Frederick Smith

The young librarian went forward towards a door of deal and ground glass
which he threw open with some ceremony

The parlour gents he said

After you sir after you said Malkiel the Second making a side step
and bringing his feet together in the first position

No no rejoined the Prophet gently drawing the sage to the front
and inserting him into the parlour in such an ingenious manner that he
did not perceive the journey of a second half sovereign from the person
of the Prophet to that of the young librarian who thereafter closed the
deal and ground glass door and returned to the counter whistling in an
absentminded manner Im a Happy Millionaire from Colorado



CHAPTER III

THE TWO PROPHETS PARTAKE OF CREAMING FOAM

And now sir said Malkiel the Second pointing to a couple of cane
chairs which with the table endeavoured rather unsuccessfully to
furnish forth the parlour at Jellybrands now sir what do you want
with me

As he spoke he threw his black overcoat wide open seated himself on
the edge of one of the chairs in a dignified attitude and crossed his
feetwhich were not innocent of spatsone over the other

The Prophet was resolved to dare all and he therefore answered
boldly

Malkiel the Second I wish to speak to you as one prophet to another

At this remark Malkiel started violently and darted a searching glance
from beneath his blonde eyebrows at Hennessey

Do you live in the Berkeley Square sir he said and claim to be a
prophet

I do said Hennessey with modest determination

Malkiel smiled a long and wreathed smile that was full of luscious
melancholy and tragic sweetness

The assumption seems rather ridiculousforgive me he exclaimed The
Berkeley Square Whatever would Madame say

Madame said the Prophet inquiringly

Madame Malkiel or Madame Sagittarius as she always passes

Your wife

My honoured lady said Malkiel with pride More to me almost than
any lunar guide or starry monitor What oh what would she say to a
prophet from the Berkeley Square

He burst into hollow laughter shaking upon the cane chair till its very
foundations seemed threatened as by an earthquake and was obliged to
apply the flight of storks to his eyes before he could in any degree
recover his equanimity At length he glanced up with tears rolling down
his cheeks

Excuse me sir he said But what can you know of prophecy in such a
fashionable neighbourhood close to Grosvenor Square and within sight
as one may say of Piccadilly Oh dear oh dear

But really said the Prophet who had flushed red but who still spoke
with pleasant mildness what influence can neighbourhood have upon such
a superterrestrial matter

Did Isaiah reside in the Berkeley Square sir

I fancy not Still

I fancy not too rejoined Malkiel Nor Bernard Wilkins either
or any prophet that ever I heard of Why even Jesse Jones lives off
Perkins Road Wandsworth Common though he does keep a sittingroom in
Berners Street just to see his clients in and he is a very lowclass
person even for a prophet No no sir Madame is quite right She
married me despite the damningyes I say sir the damning fact that I
was a prophet here Malkiel the Second brought down one of the dogskin
gloves with violence upon the rickety parlour tablebut before ever we
went to the Registrars she made me take a solemn oath What was it do
you say

Yes I do said Hennessey leaning forward and gazing into Malkiels
long and excited face round which the heavy mat of pomaded hair
vibrated

It was this sirto mix with no prophets so long as we both should
live Prophets she truly said are lowclass even dirty persons
Their parties their at homes are shoddy They live in fourthrate
neighbourhoods They burn gas and sit on horsehair Only in rare cases
do they have any bathroom in their houses Their influence would be bad
for the children when they begin to grow up How could Corona make her
_debut_Malkiel pronounced it debbewin prophetic circles How could
she come out in Drakemans Villas Tooting or dance with such young
fellers as frequent Hagglins Buildings Clapham Rise How could she do
it sir

I dont know Im sure gasped the Prophet

Nor I sir nor I continued Malkiel with unabated fervour And its
the same with Capricornus My boy shall not be thrown in with prophets
Did Malkiel the First start the _Almanac_ for that Did he foster
it till it went from the poor servant girls attic into the gilded
apartments of the aristocracy and lay even upon Royal tables for that
Did he I say

I havent an idea said the Prophet

He did not sir And II myselfhe arranged the diamond pin in his
white satin tie with an almost imperial gesturehave not followed upon
the lines he laid down without imbibing as I may truly say the lofty
spirit that guided him the lofty social spirit as Madame calls it
There have been other prophets I know There are other prophets I
do not attempt to deny it But where else than here sirthe dogskin
glove lay upon the breast of the chocolate brown frock coatwhere
else than here will you find a prophet who hides his identity beneath an
_alias_ who remains as Madame always says _perdew_ and who conducts
his profession on honourable and businesslike lines Am I dressed like
a prophet He suddenly brought his doubled fist down upon the Prophets
knee

No cried Hennessey Certainly not

Why sir how can I be when I tell you that Merriman  Saxster of
Regent Street are my tailors and have been since my first pair of
trouserings Do I bear myself prophetically I think you will agree
that I do not when you know that I am frequently mistaken for an outside
brokeryes sir and that this has even happened upon the pier at
Margate You have seen my demeanour at Jellybrands You saw me come
into the library You saw my manner with Frederick Smith Was it
assuming Did I lord it over the lad

Certainly not

No I might have been anybody any ordinary person living in Grosvenor
Place or like yourself in the Berkeley Square And so it ever is
Other prophets there arepossibly men of a certain ability even in that
directionbut there is only one Malkiel only one who attends strictly
to business who draws a good income from the stars sir and satisfies
the public month in month out without making a fuss about it Wait a
few years sir only wait

Certainly said the Prophet I will

Wait till the children are grown up Wait till Capricornus has got his
Latin by heart and gone to Oxford Then and only then you will know
whether Malkiel the Second is the exception to the rule of prophets
Yes and Madame shall know it too She trusted me sir as only a woman
can She knew I was a prophet and had a prophet for a father before me
And yet she trusted me It was a daring thing to do Many would call it
foolhardy Wouldnt they sir

The dogskin glove was raised The Prophet hastened to reply

I daresay they would

But she was not afraid and she shall have her reward Corona shall
never set foot in Drakemans Villas nor breathe the air of Hagglins I
must have a glass of water I must sir indeed

He gasped heavily and was about to rise when the Prophet said

Join me in a glass of wine

I should be delighted Malkiel answered Delighted Im sure but I
doubt whether Jellybrands

Could not Frederick Smith go out and fetch us aa pint bottle of
champagne said the Prophet playing a desperate card in the prophetic
game

An expression almost of joviality overspread the tragic farce of
Malkiels appearance

Well see he answered opening the deal door Frederick Smith

Here Mr Sagittarius cried the soprano voice of the young librarian

Can you leave the library for a moment Frederick Smith

The Prophet held up a sovereign over Malkiel the Seconds narrow
shoulder

Yes Mr Sagittarius for half a mo

Ah Where is the nearest champagne Frederick Smith

The nearest

Champagne I said Frederick Smith

I daresay I could get a dozen at Gillows next the rabbit shop
replied the young librarian thoughtfully

The Prophet shuddered to the depths of his being but he was now
embarked upon his enterprise and must crowd all sail

Go to Gillows he exclaimed with an assumption of feverish
geniality and bring back a couple of rabbitsI mean bottles They
must be dry You understand

The young librarian looked out of the window

Oh Ill manage that sir It aint raining he replied carelessly

The Prophet stifled a cry of horror as he pressed the sovereign into the
young librarians hand

You can keep the change he whispered adding in a tremulous voice
Tell metell me franklydo you think in your own mind that there will
be any

I dont know about in my own mind rejoined the young librarian
drawing a tweed cap from some hidden recess beneath the counter But if
you only want two bottles I expect therell be ten bob over

The Prophet turned as pale as ashes and had some difficulty in
sustaining himself to the parlour where he and Malkiel the Second sat
down in silence to await the young librarians return Frederick Smith
came back in about five minutes with an ostentatiouslooking bottle
smothered in gold leaf under each arm

There was four shillings apiece to pay sir he remarked to the
Prophet as he placed them upon the table I got the our own make
brand with the creaming foam upon the corks

The Prophet bent his head He was quite unable to speak but he signed
to the young librarian to open one of the bottles and pour its contents
into the two tumblers of thick and rather dusty glass that Jellybrands
kept for its moments of conviviality Malkiel the Second lifted the
goblet to the window and eyed the beaded nectar with an air of almost
rakish anticipation

Ready sir he said turning to the Prophet who with a trembling
hand followed his example

Quiteready said the Prophet shutting his eyes

Then rejoined Malkiel the Second in a formal voice heres luck

He held the tumbler to his lips waiting for the Prophets reply to give
the signal for a unanimous swallowing of the priceless wine

Luck echoed the Prophet in a faltering voice

As he gradually recovered his faculties he heard Malkiel the Second
say with an almost debauched accent

That puts heart into a man I shall give Gillows an order Leave us
Frederick Smith and remember that Miss Minerva is on no account to be
let in here till this gentleman and I have finished the second bottle

The Prophet could not resist a wild movement of protest which was
apparently taken by the young librarian as a passionate gesture of
dismissal For he left the room rapidly and closed the door with
decision behind him

And now sir I am at your service said Malkiel the Second
courteously Let me pour you another glass of wine

The Prophet assented mechanically It seemed strange to have to die
so young and with so many plans unfulfilled but he felt that it was
useless to struggle against destiny and he drank again Then he heard a
voice say

And now sir I am all attention

He looked up He saw the parlour the ground glass of the door the
tumblers and bottles on the table the sharp features and strained
farcical eyes of Malkiel framed in the matted curling hair Then all
was not over yet There was something still in store for him He sat up
pushed the creaming fourshilling foam out of his sight turned to his
interlocutor and with a great effort collected himself

I want to consult you he began about my strange powers

Malkiel smiled with easy irony

Strange powers in Berkeley Square he ejaculated The Berkeley
Square But go on sir What are they

Having been led to study the stars continued the Prophet with more
composure and growing earnestness I felt myself moved to make a
prophecy

Weather forecast I suppose remarked Malkiel laconically

How did you know that

The easiest kind sir the number one beginners prophecy Capricornus
used to tell Madame what the weatherd be as soon as he could talk But
go on sir go on I beg

The Prophet began to feel rather less like Isaiah but he continued
with some determination

If that had been all I daresay I should have thought very little of
the matter

No you wouldnt sir Who thinks their first baby a little one Can you
tell me that

The Prophet considered the question for a moment Then he answered

Perhaps youre right

Perhaps so rejoined Malkiel indulgently Well sir what was your
next attemptin the Berkeley Square

The Prophets sensitive nature winced under the obvious irony of
the interrogation but either the creaming foam had rendered him
desperate or he was to some extent steeled against the satire by the
awful selfrespect which had invaded him since Mrs Merillias accident
In any case he answered firmly

Malkiel the Second in Berkeley Square I had a relationan honoured
grandmother

Youve the better of me there sir My parents and Madames are all in
Brompton Cemetery Well sir youd got an honoured grandmother in the
Berkeley Square What of it

She was naturally elderly

And you predicted her death and she passed over Very natural too sir
The number two beginners prophecy Why Corona

But at this point the Prophet broke in

Excuse me he said in a scandalised voice excuse me Malkiel the
Second she did nothing of the kind Whatever my faults may beand they
are many I am awareII

He was greatly moved

Take another sup of wine sir You need it said Malkiel

The Prophet mechanically drank once more grasping the edge of the table
for support in the endurance of the fourbob ecstasy

You prophesied it and she didnt pass over sir continued Malkiel
with unaffected sympathy I understand the blow Its cruel hard when a
prophecy goes wrong Why even Madame

But at this point the Prophet broke in

You are mistaken he cried Utterly mistaken

Malkiel the Second drew himself up with dignity

In that case I will say no more he remarked pursing up his lengthy
mouth and assuming a castiron attitude

The Prophet perceived his mistake

Forgive me he exclaimed It is my fault

Oh no sir Not at all rejoined Malkiel with icy formality Pray
let the fault be mine

I will not indeed But let me explain My beloved grandmother still
lives although I cast her horoscope and

Indeed very remarkable

I meannot althoughbut I thought I would cast her horoscope And I
did so

In the square asked Malkiel with quiet but piercing irony

Yes said the Prophet with sudden heat Why not

Malkiel smiled with an almost paternal pity as of a thoughtful father
gazing upon the quaint and inappropriate antics of his vacant child

Why not sirif you prefer it he rejoined Pray proceed

The Prophets face was flushed either by the creaming foam or by
irritation or by both

Surely he began in a choking voice surely the stars are the
same whether they are looked at from Berkeley Square or fromfromor
fromhe sought passionately for a violent contrastfrom Newington
Butts he concluded triumphantly

I have not the pleasure to have ever observed my guides from the
neighbourhood of the Butts said Malkiel serenely But pray
proceed sir I am all attention You cast your honoured grandmothers
horoscopein the Berkeley Square

The Prophet seized his glass but some remnants of his tattered
selfcontrol still clung to him and he put it down without seeking
further madness from its contents

I did he said firmly even obstinately And I discoveredI say
discovered that she was going to have an accident while on an evening
expeditionor jaunt as you might perhaps prefer to call it

I should certainly call it soin the case of a lady who was an
honoured grandmother said Malkiel the Second in assent

Well Malkiel the Second continued the Prophet recovering his
composure as he approached his _coup_ my grandmother did have an
accident as I foretold

Did she have it in the square sir asked Malkiel

And what if she did cried the Prophet with considerable testiness

He was beginning to conceive a perfect hatred of the admirable
neighbourhood which he had loved so well

I merely ask for information sir

The accident did take place in the square certainly and on the very
night for which I predicted it

Malkiel the Second looked very thoughtful even morose He poured out
another glass of champagne drank it slowly in sips and when the glass
was empty ran the forefinger of his right hand slowly round and round
its edge

Can Madame be wrong he ejaculated at length in a muffled voice of
meditation Can Madame be wrong

The Prophet gazed at him with profound curiosity fascinated by the
circular movement of the yellow dogskin finger and by the inward
murmurso acutely mentalthat accompanied it

Madame whispered the Prophet drawing his cane chair noiselessly
forward

Ah rejoined Malkiel gazing upon him with an eye whose pupil seemed
suddenly dilated to a most preternatural size Can she have been wrong
all these many years

Whatwhat about murmured the Prophet

Malkiel the Second leaned his matted head in his hands and replied as
if to himself

Can it be that a prophet should live in Berkeley Squarenot
Kimminsshere he raised his head and raked his companion with a
glance that was almost fierce in its fervour of inquirynot Kimminss
butthe Berkeley Square



CHAPTER IV

THE SECRET WATERS OF THE RIVER MOUSE

To this question the Prophet could offer no answer other than a bodily
one He silently presented himself to the gaze of Malkiel instinctively
squaring his shoulders opening out his chest and expanding his
nostrils in an effort to fill as large a space in the atmosphere of
the parlour as possible And Malkiel continued to regard him with the
staring eyes of one whose mind is seething with strange upheaving
thoughts and alarming apprehensions Mutely the Prophet swelled and
mutely Malkiel observed him swell till a point was reached from which
further progressat least on the Prophets partwas impossible The
Prophet was now as big as the structure of his frame permitted him to
be and apparently Malkiel realised the fact for he suddenly dropped
his eyes and exclaimed

This matter must be threshed out thoroughly Madame herself would wish
it so

He paused drew his chair nearer to the Prophets took off a glove and
continued

Sir you may be a prophet You may have prophesied correctly in the
Berkeley Square But if you are and if you have remember thisthat
you have proved the selfsacrifice the privation the denial the
subterfuge the _mask_ and the position of Sagittarius Lodge in its own
grounds beside the River Mouse at Crampton St Peter NN I said
sirtotally and entirely unnecessary I will go further sir and I
will say more You have not only done that You have also proved the
sacred instinct of a woman a respectable married womansuch as we
must all reverencefalse and deceived Remember this sir remember all
this then search yourself thoroughly and say whether what you have told
me is strictly true

I assure you began the Prophet hastily

But Malkiel sternly interrupted him

Search yourself sir I beg he cried

But upon my honour

Hush sir hush I beg nay I insist that you search yourself
thoroughly before you answer this momentous question

The Prophet felt rather disposed to ask whether Malkiel expected him to
examine his pockets and turn out his boots However he sat still while
Malkiel drew out a large gold watch held it solemnly in his hand for a
couple of minutes and then returned it to the waistcoat

Now sir he said

I assure you said the Prophet on my honour that all I have said is
strictly true

And took place in the Berkeley Square

And took place in the Berkeley Square

Malkiel nodded morosely

It may have been chance he said A weather forecast and an honoured
grandmother may have been mere luck Still it looks badvery bad

He sighed heavily and seemed about to fall into a mournful reverie when
the Prophet cried sharply

Explain yourself Malkiel the Second You owe it to me to explain
yourself Why should my strange gift

If you have it sir interrupted Malkiel quickly

If I have it very wellaffect you Why should it render the
selfsacrifice andand the position ofof Sagittarius Lodge on the
riverthe riverwhat river did you say

The River Mouse rejoined Malkiel in a muffled voice and shaking his
head sadly

Exactlyon the River Mouse at Crompton

Crampton

Crampton St Peter total

N

What

Crampton St Peter N That is the point

Very wellCrampton St Peteren totally and entirely unnecessary

You desire my revelation sir You desire to enter into the bosom of
a family that hitherto has dwelt apart has lain as I may say _perdew_
beside the secret waters of the River Mouse Is it indeed so

Oh I beg your pardon cried the Prophet hastily I would not for
the world intrude upon

Those hallowed precincts Well perhaps you have the right
Jellybrands has betrayed me to you You know my name my profession
Why should you not know more Perhaps it is better so

With the sudden energy of a man who is reckless of fate he seized his
goblet poured into it at least a shillings worth of creaming foam
drained it to the dregs and shaking back his matted hair with a leonine
movement of the head exclaimed

Malkiel the First who founded the _Almanac_ lay _perdew_ all his
life

Beside the secret waters of the River Mouse the Prophet could not
help interposing

No sir He would never have gone so far as that But he lived and died
in Susan Road beside the gasworks He was a great man

Im sure he was said the Prophet heartily

He wished me to live and die there too said Malkiel But there are
limits sir even to the forbearance of women Madame was affected
painfully affected by the gas sir It stank in her nostrilsto use
a figure And then there was another drawback that she could not get
over

Indeed

The sweeps sir

I beg your pardon said the Prophet

I saidthe sweeps

I heard youwell

Being the only people that were not in the whole road made for
loneliness sir

The Prophet was entirely _bouleverse_

Im afraid Im very stupid but really I he began

Is it possible that you live in London sir and are not aware
that Susan Road lies in the most soughtafter portion of the sweeps
quarter said Malkiel with pitying amazement

The Prophet blushed with shame

I beg your pardon Of courseI understand Pray go on

It made for loneliness sir

Naturally

Their hours were not our hours And then the professional colour
Madame said it was like living among the Sandwich Islanders And so to
an extent it was My father had left a very tidy bit of moneya
very tidy bit indeed and we resolved to move But where That was the
problem For I was not as other men I could not live like themin the
Berkeley Square

He smiled with mournful superiority and continued

At least I thought so then and have done till today Prophetsso my
father believed and so Madamemust be connected with the suburbs or
with outlying districts They must not indeed they cannot be properly
prophetic within the radius A central atmosphere would reduce them to
the level of the conjuror or the muscular suggestionist Malkiel the
First my father was born himself in Peckham and met my mother when
coming through the rye

He brushed aside a tear that flowed at this almost rustic recollection
and continued

Yet Madame was wishful and I was wishful too that the childrenif
we had anyshould not grow up Eastern It was a natural and a beautiful
desire sir was it not

Oh very replied the Prophet considerably confused

The habits and manners of the East you see sir are not always in
strict accordance with propriety Are they

Before the Prophet had time to realise that this question was merely
rhetorical he began

From what Professor Seligman says in his _The Inner History of
Baghdad_ I feel sure

Nor are the customs of the East quite what many a clergyman would
approve of continued Malkiel Yet even this was not what weighed most
with Madame

What was it then inquired the Prophet deeply interested

Sir it was the Eastern language

Ah

Could we let our children learn to speak it Could we bear to launch
them in life handicapped weighed down by such a tongue Could we do
this

Again the Prophet mistook the nature of the question and was led to
reply

Certainly English children speaking only Arabic might well be at some
loss in ordinary conver

We could not sir It was impossible So we resolved to go to the north
of London and to avoid Whitechapel at whatever cost

Whitechapel almost cried the Prophet

This determination it was sir that eventually led our steps to the
borders of the River Mouse

Oh really

You know it sir

Not personally

But by repute of course

No doubt no doubt stammered the Prophet who had in fact never
before heard of this celebrated flood

That poor governess sir last Augustyou recollect

Ah indeed murmured the Prophet a trifle incoherently

And then the mad undertaker in the autumn continued Malkiel with
conscious pride he floated past our very door

Did he really

Singing his swan song no doubt poor feller as Madame said after she
read about it in the paper There were the grocers twins as well just
lately But they will be fresh in your memory

Before the Prophet had time to state whether this was so or not Malkiel
proceeded

Well sir as soon as Madame and I had come to the Mouse we resolved
that we could do no better than that It was salubrious it was retired
and it was N

You said

N sir

But what is en

Sir

The Prophet had grown very red but he was seized by the desperation
that occasionally attacks ignorance and renders it for a moment
determinedly explicit

I ask you what does en mean I am I fear a very illinformed person
and I really dont know

Think of an envelope sir said Malkiel with gentle commiseration
Well are you thinking

The Prophet grew purple

I ambut it is no use Besides why on earth should I think of an
envelope I beg you to explain

North sir the northern postal district of the metropolis Fairly
simple thatI think sir

N cried the illuminated Prophet I see I was thinking of en all
the time I beg your pardon Please go on Nof course

Malkiel concealed a smile just sufficiently to make its existence for
an instant vitally prominent and continued

By the Mouse we resolved to build a detached residence such as would
influence suitably the minds of the childrenshould we have any For
we had resolved sir by that time that with me the _Almanac_ should
cease

Here Malkiel leaned forward upon the deal table and lowered his voice to
an impressive whisper

Yes sir it had come to that We all have our ambitions and that was
mine

Good Heavens said the Prophet Malkiels _Almanac_ cease But why
Such a very useful institution

Useful More than that sir sublime Theres nothing like it

Then why let it cease

Because the social status of the prophet sir is not agreeable to
myself or Madame Ive had enough of it sir already and Im barely
turned of fifty Besides my father would have wished it I feel sure
had he lived in these days Had he seen Sagittarius Lodge the children
and how Madame comports herself he would have recognised that the
family was destined to rise into a higher sphere than that occupied by
any prophet however efficient Besides I will not deceive you I have
made money In another ten years time when I have laid by sufficient
I tell you straight sir that I shall go out of prophecy right out of
it

Then your Capricorthat is your sonwill not carry on the

Capricornus a prophet sir cried Malkiel Not if Madame and I know
it No sir Capricornus is to be an architect

As Malkiel pronounced the last words he flung his black overcoat wide
open with an ample gesture thrust one hand into his breast and assumed
the fixed and farseeing gaze of a man in a cabinet photograph He
seemed lost to his surroundings and rapt by some great vision of
enchanted architects busy in drawing plans of the magic buildings of
the future ages The Prophet felt that it would be impious to disturb
him Malkiels reverie was long and indeed the two prophets might well
have been sitting in Jellybrands parlour now had not a violent sneeze
called for the pink assistance of the flight of storks and brought the
sneezer down to the level of ordinary humanity

Yes sirI give you my word Capricornus is to be an architect
repeated Malkiel What do you say to that

Is itis it really a better profession than that of prophecy asked
the Prophet rather nervously

Malkiel smiled mournfully

Sir it may not be more lucrative but it is more select Madame will
not mix with prophets but she has a day sir on the banks of the
Mouse and she has gathered around her a very pleasant and select little
circle

Indeed

Yes sir Architects and their wives You understand

Quite rejoined the Prophet quite

Under the mesmeric influence of Malkiel he began to feel as if
architects were some strange race of sacred beings set apart denizens
of some holy isle or blessed nook of mediaeval legend Would he ever
meet them Would he ever encounter one ranging unfettered where flowed
the waters of the River Mouse

They do not know who we are sir continued Malkiel furtively To
them and to the whole worldexcepting Jellybrands and youwe are the
Sagittariuses of Sagittarius Lodge people at ease sir living upon our
competence beside the Mouse They do not see the telescope sir in the
locked studio at the top of the lodge They do not know why sometimes
on Madames Wednesdays I am palewith sitting up on behalf of the
_Almanac_ For Capricornuss sake and for Coronas all this is hid from
the world Madame and I are the victims of a double life Yes sir for
the childrens sake we have never dared to let it be known what I really
am

Suddenly he began to grow excited

And now he cried after all these years of secrecy after all
these years of avoiding the central districtsin which Madame longs
to liveafter all these years of seclusion beyond the beat even of the
buses do you come here to me and search yourself and say upon your
oath that a prophet can live and be a prophet in the Berkeley Square
that he can read the stars with Gunters just opposite ay and bring
out an almanac if he likes within a shilling fare of the Circus If this
is sohe struck the deal table violently with his clenched fistof
what use are the sacrifices of myself and Madame Of what use is it to
live under a modest name such as Sagittarius when I might be Malkiel
the Second to the whole world Of what use to flee from W and dwell
perpetually in N Why if what you say is true we might leave the
Mouse tomorrow and Madame could pop in and out of the Stores just like
any lady of pleasure

At the thought of this so long foregone enchantment Malkiels emotion
completely overcame him his voice died away overborne by a violent fit
of choking and he sat back in his cane chair trembling in every limb
The Prophet was deeply moved by his emotion and longed most sincerely
to assuage it But his deep and growing conviction of his own power
rendered him useless as a comforter He could not lie He could not deny
that he was a prophet He could only say in his firmest voice

Malkiel the Second be brave You must see this thing through

On hearing these original and noble words Malkiel lifted up his marred
countenance

I know it sir I know it he answered One moment The thought of
Madamethe StoresIof all that might perhaps have been

He choked again The Prophet looked away A strong mans emotion is
always very scared and very terrible Three minutes swept by then the
Prophet heard a calm and hollow voice say

And now sir to business

The Prophet looked up and perceived that Malkiels overcoat was
tightly buttoned and that his mouth was tightly set in an expression of
indomitable though tragic resolution

What business asked the Prophet

Mine replied Malkiel Mine sir and yours You have chosen to enter
my life You cannot deny that You cannot deny that I sought to avoidI
might even say to dodge you

With the remembrance of the recent circus performance in the library
still strong upon him the Prophet could not He bowed his head

Very well sir You have chosen to enter my life That act has given me
the right to enter yours Am I correct

I supposeI meanyes you are answered the Prophet overwhelmed by
the pitiless logic of his companion and wondering what was coming next

I have been forcedI think I may say thatto reveal myself to you
sir Nothing can ever alter that Nothing can ever take from you the
knowledgedenied by Madame to the very architectsof who I really am
You have told me sir that I must see this thing through I tell
you now at this table in this parlour that I intend to see it
throughand through

As Malkiel said the last words he gazed at the Prophet with eyes that
seemed suddenly to have taken on the peculiar properties of the gimlet
The Prophet began to feel extremely uneasy But he said nothing He felt
that there was more to come And he was right

It is my duty continued Malkiel in a louder voice my sacred duty
to Madameto say nothing of Corona and Capricornusto probe you to
the corehere the Prophet could not resist a startled movement of
protestand to search you to the quick

Oh really cried the Prophet

This duty I shall carry out unflinchingly pursued Malkiel at
whatever cost to myself This will not be our last interview Do not
think it

I assure you inserted the Prophet endeavouring vainly to seem at
ease I do not wish to think it

It matters little whether you wish to do so or not continued Malkiel
with an increasingly Juggernaut air The son of Malkiel the First is
not a man to be trifled with or dodged Moreover much more than the
future of myself and family depends upon what you really are From this
day forth you will be bound up with the _Almanac_

Merciful Heavens ejaculated the Prophet unable intrepid as he was
to avoid recoiling when he found himself thus suddenly confronted with
the fate of an appendix

For why should it ever cease proceeded Malkiel with growing passion
Whyif a prophet can live as you declare freely and openly in the
Berkeley Square If this is so why should I not remove along with
Madame and family from the borders of the Mouse and reside henceforth
in a central situation such as I should wish to reside in Why should
not Capricornus eventually succeed me in the _Almanac_ as I succeeded
Malkiel the First Already the boy shows the leanings of a prophet
Hitherto Madame and I have endeavoured to stifle them to turn them in
an architectural direction You understand

I am trying to stammered the Prophet

Hitherto we have corrected the boys table manners when they have
become too like those of the average prophetas they often havefor
hitherto we have had reason to believe that all prophetswith the
exception of myselfwere dirty deceitful and essentially suburban
persons But if you are a prophet we have been deceived Trust me sir
I shall find speedy means to pierce you to the very marrow

The Prophet began mechanically to feel for his hat

Are you desirous of anything sir said Malkiel sharply

No said the Prophet wondering whether the moment had arrived to
throw off all further pretence of bravery and to shout boldly for the
assistance of the young librarian

Then why are you feeling about sir Why are you feeling about

Was I faltered the Prophet

You are looking for another glass of wine perhaps

No indeed said the Prophet desperately For anything but that

But Malkiel moved by some abruptly formed resolution called suddenly
in a powerful voice

Frederick Smith

Here Mr Sagittarius cried the young librarian appearing with
suspicious celerity upon the parlour threshold

Draw the cork of the second bottle Frederick Smith said Malkiel
impressively This gentleman is about to take the pledgeon hearing
this ironic paradox the Prophet stood up very much in the attitude
formerly assumed by Malkiel when about to dodge in the librarythat I
shall put to him concluded Malkiel also standing up and assuming the
library posture of the Prophet

Indeed the situation of the library seemed about to be accurately
reversed in the parlour of Jellybrands

The young librarian assisted the cork to emerge phlegmatically from the
neck of the second bottle of champagne mechanically smacking his lips
the while

Now pour and leave us Frederick Smith

The young librarian helped the fatiguedlooking wine into the two
glasses where it lay as if thoroughly exhausted by the effort of
getting there and then languidly left the parlour turning his bulging
head over his shoulder to indulge in a pathetic _oeillade_ ere he
vanished

The Prophet watched him go

Close the door Frederick Smith cried Malkiel in a meaning manner

The Prophet blushed a guilty red and the young librarian obeyed with a
bang

And now sir I must request you to take a solemn pledge in this
vintage said Malkiel placing one of the tumblers in the Prophets
trembling hand

Really said the Prophet I am not at all thirsty

Why should you be sir What has that got to do with it retorted
Malkiel Lift your glass sir

The Prophet obeyed

And now take this pledgethat till the last day

What day

The last day sir you will reveal to no living person that there is
such an individual as Malkiel that you have ever met him who he is or
who Madame and family are unless I give the word You have surprised my
secret You have forced yourself upon me You owe me this Drink

Mechanically the Prophet drank

Swear

Mechanicallyindeed almost like a British working manthe Prophet
swore

Malkiel drained his tumbler and drew on the dogskin glove which in the
agitation of a previous moment he had thrown aside

I have your card sir here is mine I shall now take the train to the
River Mouse on whose banks I shall confer at once with Madame Till
I have done this I cannot tell you what form the tests I shall have to
apply to you will take When I have done it you will hear from me Your
servant sir

He bowed majestically and was turning towards the door when it was
hastily opened and a lady appeared frantically in the aperture



CHAPTER V

MALKIEL THE SECOND POISONS MISS MINERVA

Miss Minerva exclaimed Malkiel the Second

Lady Enid cried the Prophet at the same moment

You cant go in there Miss Partridge ejaculated the young librarian
simultaneously from the further room

The lady a tall girl of twentytwo with grey eyes dark smooth hair
and a very agreeable though slightly Scottish mouth began to behave
rather like a stag at bay She panted and looked wildly round as if
meditating how and in what direction she could best bolt

Whats the matter cried the Prophet his voice becoming not a little
piercing from surprise and his previous stress of agitation

You cant go in there Miss Minerva requested the young librarian
who had now gained the parlour threshold and who seemed about to take
up a very determined stand thereon

I must go inI must said the lady in a mellow but again slightly
Scottish voice Dont tell anybody Im here or youll be sorry

And with these words she bounded into the parlour and banged the door
on the young librarian The Prophet opened his lips preparatory to a
third wild exclamation

Hush the lady hissed aristocratically

She shook her head vigourously at him sank down on one of the cane
chairs held up her right hand and leant towards the door It was
obvious that she was listening for something with strained attention
and so eloquent was her attitude that the two prophets were infected
with her desire They turned their eyes mechanically towards the deal
door and listened too For a moment there was silence Then a heavy
footstep resounded upon the library floor accompanied by the sharp tap
of a walking stick The ladys attitude became more tense and the pupils
of her handsome grey eyes dilated

Has a young female just entered this shop said a very heavy and
rumbling voice

This aint a shop sir replied the high soprano of the young
librarian indignantly

Bandy no words with me thou infamous malapert returned the first
voice But answer my question Have you a young female concealed within
these loathsome precincts

Under ordinary circumstances it is very possible that the young
librarian might have betrayed the lady as he had already betrayed
Malkiel the Second But it happened that there existed upon the earth
one object and one object only towards which he felt a sense of
chivalry This object was Jellybrands Library His reply to the voice
was therefore as follows and was delivered in his highest key and with
extreme volubility and passion

Loathsome precincts yourself Youre a nice one you are chasing
respectable ladies about at your age There aint no young females in
the library and if there was I shouldnt trot em out for you to clap
your ugly old eyes on Now then out yer go No more words about it Out
yer go

A prolonged sound of hard breathing and of feet scraping violently upon
bare boards followed upon this deliverance complicated by the sharp
snap of a breaking walking stick the thump of a falling chair a bang
as of a heavy body encountering firm resistance from some inflexible
article of furnitureprobably a bookcaseand finally a tremendous
thundering as of the hoofs of a squadron of cavalry charging over
a parquet floor the crash of a door the grinding of a key swiftly
turning in a lock andsilence

The lady Malkiel the Second and the Prophet looked at one another and
the lady opened her mouth

Dyou think hes killed him she whispered with considerable
curiosity

There came a distant noise of a torrent of knocks upon a door

No he hasnt added the lady arranging her dress Thats a good
thing

The two prophets nodded The torrent of knocks roared louder slightly
failed upon the ear made a crescendo emulated Niagara surpassed that
very American effort of nature wavered faltered to Lodore died away
to a feeble tittup like water dropping from a tap to flagstones rose
again in a final spurt that would have made Southey open his dictionary
for adjectives and drained away to death

The lady leaned back For the first time her composure seemed about
to desert her entirely That fatal sign in woman a working throat
swallowing nothing with extreme rapidity and persistence became
apparent

A glass of wine Miss Minerva cried Malkiel gallantly

He placed a tumbler to her lips She feebly sipped than sprang to her
feet with a cry

Im poisoned

You never spoke a truer word said the Prophet solemnly

What is it continued the lady frantically What has he given me

Champagne at four shillings a bottle brought fresh from next door to
a rabbit shop answered the Prophet looking at Malkiel with almost
malignant satisfaction

The lady who had gone white as chalk darted to the door and flung it
open

A glass of water she cried Get me a glass of water

The young librarian came forward with a black eye

Its all right maam The gentlemans gone he piped

What gentleman Give me a glass of water or I shall die

The young librarian who had already an injured air proceeded from a
positive to a comparative condition of appearance

Well I never What gentleman he exclaimed And me blue and black
all over to say nothing of the bookcase and the new paint thatll be
wanted for the door

Can you chatter about trifles at such a moment cried the Prophet
Dont you see the ladys been poisoned

Whatby the old gent returned the young librarian Then what does
she come to a library for Why dont she go to a chemist

The lady turned her agonised eyes upon the Prophet

Take me to one she whispered through pale lips

She tottered towards him and leaned upon his arm

Trust me trust me I will said the Prophet Direct me he added to
the young librarian

Theres one on the other side of the rabbit shop said that worthy
who had suddenly become exceedingly glum in manner and morose in
appearance

Thank you Kindly unlock the door

The young librarian did so lethargically and the lady and the Prophet
began to move slowly into the street Just as they were gaining it
Malkiel the Second cried out

One moment sir

Not one retorted the Prophet firmly Not one till this lady has had
an antidote

He walked on with determination Supporting the lady But ere he got
quite out of earshot he caught these fragments of a shattered speech
hurtling through the symphony of London noises

Banks of the MouseMadamesake of Capricorbe
sure Iprobequicksearchthe very corehear from
mearchitectsmarrowalmanacthe last daythe Berkeley square

The final ejaculation melted away into the somewhat powerful discord
produced by the impact of a brewers dray with a runaway omnibus at the
corner of Greek Street which was eventually resolved by the bursting
of a motor carcontaining two bookmakers and an acting managerwhich
mingled with them at the rate of perhaps forty miles an hour

Yes please a hansom said Lady Enid Thistle some five minutes
later as she and the Prophet stood together upon the kerb in front of
the rabbit shop I feel much better now

The Prophet hailed a hansom and handed her into it

Which way are you going he asked

Lady Enid looked doubtful

I ought to be going back to Jellybrands she said I had an
appointment But reallyyou see Mr Sagittarius is there and
altogetherI dont know

She was obviously still upset by the creaming foam and the other
incidents of the afternoon

Come to tea with grannie said the Prophet

Shes at home

Yes Shes twisted her ankle

Oh Im so sorry

Let me escort you

Thanks I think I will

You wont mind stopping for a moment at Hollingss said the Prophet
in Piccadilly Circus I promised to buy some roses Somebody is coming
in to tea

On no But who is it

I dont know Only one person I think An old friend no doubt
Probably the Central American Ambassadors grandfather

Oh if thats all I feel a little shaky still

Naturally

The Prophet bought the roses and they drove on

Its very nice of you not to ask any questions observed Lady Enid
presently

The Prophet had been thinking it was but he only said

Oh not at all

Im a woman promised Lady Enid and I dont know whether I can be so
nice

The Prophet glanced at her and met her curious grey eyes

Tryplease he replied very gently thinking of the oath which he had
just taken

Lady Enid was silent for two minutes then she remarked

I have tried but I cant succeed Why on earth were you closeted in
the parlourat my time toowith Mr Sagittarius this afternoon

Then you really are Miss Minerva Partridge And it was really you who
hadhadwell bespoke the parlour at halfpast three

Certainly Now we are neither of us nice but were both of us human

There were some letters for you said the Prophet

Lady Enid wrinkled her smooth young healthylooking forehead

How stupid of me Ill fetch them tomorrow Well

She looked at the Prophet with obvious expectation

Im so sorry I cant tell you he replied with gentle firmness

Oh all right she rejoined But now Im at a disadvantage You know
Im Miss Minerva

Yes But I dont know why you are or why you go to Jellybrands or
why you rushed into the parlour or who the old gentleman was that

The cab stopped before Mrs Merillias house

In the hall upon an oaken bench they perceived a very broadbrimmed
top hat standing on its head Beside it lay two pieces of a stout and
knobbly walking stick which had been broken in half Lady Enid started
violently

Good Heavens she cried

She picked up the walking stick examined it and laid it down

I dont think I want any tea she murmured

Im sure you do said the Prophet with some pressure

She stood still for a moment Then catching the attentive round eye of
Gustavus who was waiting by the hall door she shrugged her shoulders
and walked towards the staircase

Its very hard lines she murmured as she began to ascend all
the questions you wanted to ask are being answered You know Im Miss
Minerva already In another minute youll know who the old gentleman was
that

The Prophet could tell from the expression of her straight slightly
Scottish back that she was pouting as she entered the drawingroom
where Mrs Merillia was having tea withsomebody



CHAPTER VI

THE OLD ASTRONOMER DISCOURSETH OF THE STARS

Never before had the Prophet felt so alive with curiosity as he did when
he followed Lady Enid into Mrs Merillias presence for he knew that he
was about to see the venerable victim of the young librarians
indignant chivalry the old gent who had come to intimate terms with
Jellybrands bookcase and who had kicked and knocked at least a pint
of paint off Jellybrands door His eyes were large and staring as he
glanced swiftly from his grandmothers sofa to the huge telescope under
whose very shadow was seated no less a personage than Sir Tiglath Butt
holding a cup of tea on one hand and a largesized muffin in the other

No wonder the Prophet jumped No wonder Mrs Merillia cried out in her
pretty clear voice

Take care of Beau Hennessey Youre treading on him

The dachshunds pathetic shriek of outrage made the rafters ring Mrs
Merillia put her mittens to her ears and Sir Tiglath dropped his muffin
into a jar of potpourri

I beg your pardon said the Prophet earnestly Sir Tiglaththis is
indeed a sura pleasure

Lady Enid was being embraced by Mrs Merillia The Prophet extended his
hand to the astronomer who however turned his back to the company
and diving one of his enormous hands into the potpourri jar began to
rummage violently for his vanished meal

What is it said the Prophet who had not seen the muffin go Can I
help you

Still presenting his huge back and the purple nape of his fat neck to
the assemblage the astronomer after trying in vain to extract the lost
dainty in a legitimate manner turned the jar upside down and poured
the roseleaves and the muffin in a heterogeneous libation upon the
Chippendale table After a close examination of it he turned around
holding up the food to whose buttered surface several leaves adhered in
a disordered but determined manner

Only a Persian could devour this muffin now he said in his rumbling
singsong and strangely theatrical voice which always suggested that he
was about to deliver a couple of hundred or so lengths of blank verse
Omar beneath his tree perchance or Gurustu who to Baghdad came with
steed afoam and eyes aflame Wherefore do you trample upon hapless
animals that are not dumb young man and cause the poor astronomer to
cast his muffin upon the roses where mayhap the housemaid might find
it after many days Ohhhh

He uttered a tremulous bass cry of mingled reproach and despair that
sounded rather like the wail of some deplorable watchman upon a city
wall shaking his enormous head at the Prophet the while and flapping
his red hands slowly in the air

How dyou do Sir Tiglath said Lady Enid coming up to him with light
carelessness

Sir Tiglath bowed

Very ill very ill he rumbled looking at her furtively with his
glassy eyes One has had an afternoon of tragedy an afternoon of
brawling and of disturbance in an avenue that shall henceforth be
called accursed

He sat down upon his armchair with his short legs stuck straight out
and resting upon his heels alone his hands folded across his stomach
and his purple triple chin sunk in his elaborate but very dusty
cravat Wagging his head to and fro he added with the heavy
concluding tremolo that decorated most of his vocal efforts Thrice
accursed Ohhhh

Lady Enid who seemed to have quite recovered her selfpossession sat
down by Mrs Merillia while the Prophet in some confusion offered to
his grandmother the bunch of roses he had bought at Hollingss

Theyre a little late grannie Im afraid he said But I was
unavoidably detained

Mrs Merillia glanced at him sharply

Detained Hennessey Then you found what you were seeking

The Prophet remembered his oath and turned scarlet

No no grannie he murmured hastily and looking like a criminal I
met Lady Enid he added

Where did you meet the lady young man said Sir Tiglath Was it in
the accursed avenue

Lady Enid shot a hasty glance of warning at the Prophet Mrs Merillia
intercepted it and began to form fresh ideas of that young person whom
she had formerly called sensible but whom she now began to think of as
crafty

Which avenue is that Sir Tiglath asked the Prophet with a rather
inadequate assumption of innocence

The Avenue in which one beholds the perfidy darting into hidden places
young man in which the defenders of foolish virgins are buffeted and
browbeaten by counterjumpers with craniums as big as the great nebula
of Orion The avenue named after a crumbled philanthropist who could
walk sheeted through the atrocious night could his sacred dust awake
to the abominations that are perpetrated under the protection of his
shadow Let dragons lay it waste like the highways of Babylon

He gathered up a crumpet and blinked at Lady Enid who was airily
sipping her tea with a slightly detached air of calm and maidenly
dignity

I think Sir Tiglath must be describing Shaftesbury Avenue remarked
Mrs Merillia rather mischievously

Oh really stammered the Prophet I had no idea that it was such an
evil neighbourhood

Where is Shaftesbury Avenue asked Lady Enid gently folding a
fragment of thin bread and butter and nibbling it with her pretty mouth

Sir Tiglath elevated his hands and rolled his eyes

Where partridges are to be found in January ohhhh was his very
unexpected reply

The Prophet started violently and even Lady Enid looked disconcerted
for a moment

What do you mean Sir Tiglath she said recovering herself

She turned to Mrs Merillia

I wonder what he means she said He never talks sensibly unless
he is in his observatory or lecturing to the Royal Society on the
Regularity of Heavenly Bodies or

The irregularities of earthly ones interposed Sir Tiglath In the
accursed avenueohhh

I fear Sir Tiglath you must be a member of the Vigilance Society
said Mrs Merillia

Yes He looks at the morals of the stars through his telescope said
Lady Enid By the waydo you too she added to the Prophet for the
first time observing the instrument in the bow window

Mrs Merillia and Sir Tiglath exchanged a glance An earnest expression
came into the Prophets face

I confess he said with becoming modesty in the presence of the
great master of modern astronomy that I do watch the heavens from that
window

And for what purpose young man rumbled Sir Tiglath for the first
time dropping his theatrical manner of an old barnstormer and speaking
like any ordinary fogey such as you may see at a meeting on behalf of
the North Pole or at a dinner of the Odde Volumes

Forfor purposes of research Sir Tiglath answered the Prophet with
some diplomacy

The young man trieth to put off the old astronomer with fair words
bellowed Sir Tiglath The thief inserteth his thumb into the tail
pocket of the unobservant archbishop for purposes of research The young
man playeth merrily forsooth with the old astronomer

Mrs Merillia nodded her lace cap at him encouragingly It was evident
that there was an understanding between them Lady Enid began to wonder
what was its nature The Prophet seemed rather disconcerted at the
reception given to his not wholly artless ambiguity

Grannie he said turning to Mrs Merillia you know how deeply the
stars interest me

For their own sake young man said Sir Tiglath Or as the accursed
avenue interests the foolish virginsfor the sake of frivolity idle
curiosity or dark doings which could not support the light even of a
star of the sixth magnitude Can you tell your admirable and revered
granddam that

This time underneath his preposterous manner and fantastic speech both
Lady Enid and the Prophet fancied that they could detect an element of
real gravity even perhaps a hint of weighty censure which made them
both feel very youngrising two or thereabouts

I was originally led to study stars Sir Tiglath because I had the
honour to meet you and make your acquaintance said the Prophet
valiantly

The astronomer lapsed at once into his first manner

In what fair company did the old astronomer converse with the young
man he cried His memory faileth him He doteth and cannot recall the
great occasion

It was at the Colley Cibber Club Sir Tiglath said the
Prophet firmly But wewe did not converse You had aa slight
indisposition

Would you venture to implyin the presence of your notable
granddamthat one had looked upon the wine when it was red young man

You had a glass of port by you certainly Sir Tiglath But you also
had a cold which you gave me to understandby signshad affected your
throat and prevented you from carrying on conversation

Then was it the vision of the old astronomers personal and starry
beauty that led you hot foot to Venus through yonder telescope
Ohhhh

I did not take observations of Venus first answered the Prophet
with a certain proud reserve I began by an examination into The Milky
Way

Sir Tiglath impounded another crumpet

Go on young man he cried The old astronomer lendeth ear

The Prophet who felt very much like a nervous undergraduate undergoing
a _vivavoce_ examination continued

I became deeply interested strongly attracted by thethe heavenly
bodies They fascinated me I could think of nothing else

Lady Enids Scottish lips tightened almost imperceptibly

I could talk of nothing else proceeded the Prophet Could I
grannie

No indeed Hennessey assented Mrs Merillia All other topics were
banished from discussion

All cried the Prophet with increasing fervour and lack of
selfconsciousness I could not tear myself from the telescope I
longed for a perpetual night and found the day almost intolerably
irksome

Sir Tiglaths brickred countenance was irradiated with a smile that did
not lack geniality

The old astronomer lendeth attentive ear to the young mans epic he
roared through the crumpet He approveth the young mans admiration
for the heavenly bodies Go on

But at the last command the Prophet seemed suddenly to jib The reserved
expression returned to his face

Thats all Sir Tiglath he said

The astronomer and Mrs Merillia again exchanged a glance which was not
unobserved by Lady Enid Then Sir Tiglath with an abrupt and portentous
gravity exclaimed in thunderous tones

Sir are you a man of science or have you the brain of a charlatan
enclosed in the fleshy envelope of a conjurer and a sinner Do you study
the noble and beautiful stars for their own sakes to find out what they
are and what they are doing what is their nature and what their place
in the great scheme or do you peek and pry at them through the keyhole
of a contemptible curiosity in order to discover what you think they
can do for you to set you on high to puff you out into a personage
and cause you to be noticed of the foolish ones of this world Which are
you sir a young man of parts whose hand I can grasp fraternally or
an insulter of planets sir a Peeping Tom upon the glorious nudity of
Venus a Paul Pry squinting at the mysteries of Mercury for an unholy
and what is more an idiotic purpose What do you ask of the stars
sir Tell the old astronomer that

The Prophet was considerably taken aback by this tirade which caused
the many ornaments in the pretty room to tremble He gazed at his
grandmother and found her nodding approval of Sir Tiglath He glanced
at Lady Enid She was leaning back in her chair and looking amused like
a person at an entertainment

What do I ask Sir Tiglath he murmured in some confusion

Do you ask about your reverent granddams hallowed ankles sir Do
you afflict the stars with inquiries about the state of the ridiculous
weather Is that it

The Prophet understood that Mrs Merillia had been frank with the
astronomer He cast upon her a glance of respectful reproach

Yes Hennessey she answered I have My dear child I thought it for
the best This prophetic business would soon have been turning the
house upside down and at my age Im really not equal to living at
close quarters with a determined young prophet To do so would upset the
habits of a lifetime So Sir Tiglath knows all about it

There was a moment of silence which was broken by the agreeable voice
of Lady Enid saying

All about what Remember please that Im a young woman and that all
young women share one quality All about what please

Mrs Merillia looked at the Prophet The Prophet looked at Sir Tiglath
who wagged his great head and cried with rolling pathos and rebuke

Ohhhh

PleaseMr Vivian repeated Lady Enid with considerable
determination

Grannie means that Ithatwell that I have been enabled by the stars
to foretell certain future events said the Prophet glancing rather
furtively at Sir Tiglath while he spoke to note the effect of the
desperate declaration

Ohhhh bellowed the distressed astronomer shaking like a jelly in
his wrath

What cried Lady Enid in an almost piercing voice and with a manner
that had suddenly become most animated Whatlike Malkiels _Almanac_
does

This remark had a very striking effect upon Sir Tiglath an effect
indeed so striking that it held Mrs Merillia Lady Enid and the Prophet
in a condition of paralytic expectation for at least three minutes by
the grandmothers clock in the corner of the drawingroom

The venerable astronomer was already very stout in person and very
inflamed in appearance But at this point in the discourse he suddenly
became so very much stouter and so very much more inflamed that his
audience of three gazed upon him rather as little children gaze upon
dough which has been set by the cook to rise and which is fulfilling
its mission with an unexpected and indeed intemperate vivacity
Their eyes grew round their features rigid their hands tense their
attitudes expectant Leaning forward they stared upon Sir Tiglath with
an unwinking fixity and preternatural determination that was almost
entirely infantine And while they did so he continued slowly to expand
in size and to deepen in colour until mortality seemed to drop from
him He ceased to be a man and became a phenomenon a purple thing that
journeyed towards some unutterable end portentous as marching judgment
tragic as fate searching as epidemic and yet heavily painted and
generally touched up by the brush of some humorous demon such as lays
about him in preparation for Christmas pantomime sworn to provide the
giants faces and the ogres heads for Drury Lane

Dont at last cried a young voice Dont Sir Tiglath

A peal of laughter followed the remark of that laughter which is loud
and yet entirely without the saving grace of merriment a mere sudden
demonstration of hysteria

Oh Sir Tiglathdont

A second laugh joined the first and rang up with it older but also
hystericalMrs Merillias

No noplease dont Sir TigTig

A third laugh burst into the ring seeming to complete it fatallythe
Prophets

Sir Tiglathfor Heavens sakedont

The adjuration came from a trio of choked voices and might have given
pause even to a descending lift or other inflexible and blind machine

But still the astronomer grew steadily more gigantic in person and more
like the god of wine in hue The three voices failed and the terrible
united laughter was just upon the point of breaking forth again when a
diversion occurred The door of the drawingroom was softly opened and
Mrs Fancy Quinglet appeared upon the threshold holding in her hands an
icewool shawl for the comfort of her mistress It chanced that as the
phenomenon of the astronomer was based upon a large elbow chair exactly
facing the door she was instantly and fully confronted by it She did
not drop the shawl as any ordinary maid would most probably have done
Mrs Fancy was not of that kidney She did not even turn tail or give a
months warning or a scream She was of those women who when they meet
the inevitable instinctively seem to recognise that it demands courage
as a manner and truth as a greeting She therefore stared straight at
Sir Tiglathmuch as she stared at Mrs Merillia when she was about to
arrange that ladys wig for an assemblyand remarked in a decisive
though very respectful tone of voice

The gentlemans about to burst maam I cant speak different nor mean
other

Upon finding their thoughts thus deftly gathered up and woven into
a moderately grammatical sentence Mrs Merillia Lady Enid and the
Prophet experienced a sense of extraordinary relief and no longer felt
the stern necessity of laughing But this was not the miracle worked
by Mrs Fancy Had she even then rested satisfied with her acumen
maintained silence and awaited the immediate fulfilment of her
prediction what must have happened can hardly be in doubt But she
was seized by that excess of bravery which is called foolhardiness and
driven by it to that peculiar and thoughtless vehemence of action which
sometimes wins VCs for men who in later days conceal amazement
under the cherished decoration She suddenly laid down the icewool
shawl upon a neighbouring sociable walked up to the phenomenon of the
astronomer and remarked to it with great distinctness

Youre about to burst sir I know it sir and I cant know other

At this point the miracle happened for instead of responding to the
ladysmaids appeal and promptly disintegrating into his respective
atoms Sir Tiglath suddenly became comparatively small and comparatively
pale sat forward wagged his head at Mrs Fancy and rumbled out in his
ordinary voice

Have you never heard where liars go to woman Ohhhh

On finding that nothing of supreme horror was about to happen Mrs
Fancys courageas is the way of womans courageforsook her she
broke into tears and had to be immediately led forth to the servants
hall by the Prophet exclaiming persistently with every step they
took

I cant help it Master Hennessey I say again as I said aforethe
gentlemans about to burst Them that knows other let them declare it

Yes yes Its all right Fancy its all right We all agree with you
Now now you mustnt cry

I cantknowother Master Hennessey normean different I cant
indeed Master Hennessey I cantknow othernor

No no Of course not There sit down and compose yourself

He gave the poor afflicted liar tenderly into the care of the upper
housemaid and retraced his steps quickly to the drawingroom As he
entered it he heard Sir Tiglath saying

The stars in their courses tremble when the accursed name of Malkiel is
mentioned and the old astronomer is dissolved in wrath at sound of the
pernicious word Ohhhh

There Hennessey cried Mrs Merillia turning swiftly to her grandson
with all her cap ribands fluttering You hear what Sir Tiglath says

If that accursed name belonged to an individual continued the
astronomer waving his hands frantically over the last remaining
crumpet instead of representing a syndicate of ruffianly underground
criminals the old astronomer well stricken in years though he be
would hunt him out of his hidingplace and slay him with his own feeble
and scientific hands

So saying he grasped the crumpet as if it had been an assegai and
assailed himself with it so violently that it entirely disappeared

But Malkiel is an began Mrs Merillia

The Prophet stopped her with a glance whose almost terrorstricken
authority surprised her into silence

But I thought Malkiel was a man cried Lady Enid looking towards the
Prophet

Hefor I will not foul my lips with the accursed nameis not a
man roared Sir Tiglath He is a syndicate He is a company He meets
together doubtless in some low den of the city He reads reports to
himself of the illgotten gains accruing from his repeated insults to
the heavens round some abominable table covered with green cloth He
quotes the prices of the shares in him and declares dividends and
carries balances forward and some day will wind himself up or cast
himself anew upon the mercy of the market Part of him is probably
Jew part South African and part America The whole of him is thrice
accursed

He began to expand once more but Mrs Merillia perceived the tendency
and checked it in time

Pray Sir Tiglath she said almost severely dont With my sprained
ankle I am really not equal to it

Sir Tiglath had enough chivalry to stop and Lady Enid once again
chipped in

But really Im almost sure Malkiel is a

She caught the Prophets eye as Mrs Merillia had and paused He
turned to the astronomer

But how can a company make itself into a prophet he asked

Young man you talk idly What are companies formed for if not to make
profits retorted Sir Tiglath Every one is a company nowadays Dont
you know that Murchison the famous writer of novels is a company
Jeremy the actormanager is a company So is Bynion the quack doctor
and the Rev Mr Kinnimer who supplies tracts to the upper classes and
Upton the artist whose pictures make tours like Sarah Bernhardt and
Watkins whose philosophy sells more than Tuppers and Caroline Jingo
who writes war poems and patriotic odes If you were to invite these
supposed seven persons to dinner and all of them came you would have
to lay covers for at least fifty scoundrels Ohhhh

Well but how are you sure thatahemthe _Almanac_ person is also
plural Sir Tiglath inquired Mrs Merillia

Because I sought him with the firm intention of assault and battery
for fiveandforty years returned the astronomer And only gave up my
Christian quest when I was assured on excellent authority that he was
a company and had originally been formed in the United States for the
making of money and the defiance of the heavenly bodies May bulls and
bears destroy him

Well its very odd said Lady Enid Very odd indeed

As she spoke she glanced at the Prophet and met his eyes There are
moments when the mere expression in another persons eyes seems to shout
a request at one The expression in the Prophets eyes performed this
feat at this moment with such abrupt vehemence that Lady Enid felt
almost deafened She leaned back in her chair as if avoiding a missile
and exclaimed

Of course And I never guessed it

Guessed what my dear inquired Mrs Merillia

Why thatheitwas a company replied Lady Enid

The Prophet blessed and thanked her with a piercing and saved look

Nor I he assented descending into the very mine of subterfuge for
his recent oaths sake nor I or I should never have taken the useless
trouble that I have taken

He managed to say this with such conviction that his grandmother
who in the past had always found him to be transparently honest and
sincere was carried away by the deception She wrinkled her long nose
as was her habit when sincerely pleased and cried gaily

Then Hennessey now youve heard Sir Tiglaths opinion of the practice
of trying to turn the stars into moneymakers and the planets into old
gipsy women who tell fortunes to silly servant girls Im sure youll
never study them again Come promise me

The Prophet made no answer

Hennessey cried his grandmother with tender pertinacity promise
me Sir Tiglath join your voice to mine

Sir Tiglath had become really grave not theatrically serious

Young man he said your revered granddam asks of you a righteous
thing Who are you to trifle with those shining worlds that make a
beauty of the night and that stir eternity in the soul of man Who are
you to glue your pinpoint of a human eye to yonder machine and play with
the stupendous Jupiter and Saturn as a child plays with marbles or with
pegtops Who are you that thinks those glittering monsters have nothing
to do but to inform your pigmy brain of snowfalls street accidents
and loveaffairs prematurely so that you may flaunt about your
pockethandkerchief of a square pluming your dwarfship that you are a
prophet Fie young man and again fie Bow the knee as I do to the
mysteries of the great universal scheme instead of bothering them
to turn informers and give away the knowledge which is deliberately
hidden from us Show me a man that can understand the present and youll
have shown me a god And yet you knock at the gates of the heavens
through that telescope and clamour to be told the future Fie upon you
young man fie Ohhhh

Now the Prophet as has been before observed possessed a very sensitive
nature He was also very devoted to his grandmother and had an
extraordinary reverence for the worldfamed attainments of Sir Tiglath
Butt Therefore when he heard Mrs Merillias pleading and the
astronomers weighty denunciation he was deeply moved Nevertheless so
strongly had recent events appealed to his curiosity so ardently did he
desire to search into the reality of his own peculiar powers that it
is very doubtful whether he might not have withstood both the behests of
affection and of admiration had it not been that they took to themselves
an ally whose force is one of the moving spirits of the world This
ally was fear Just as the Prophet was beginning to feel obstinate and
to steel himself to resistance he remembered the fierce and horrible
threats of Malkiel the Second If he should cease to concern himself
with the stars if he should cease to prophesy not alone should he
restore peace to his beloved grandmother and pay the tribute of respect
to Sir Tiglath but he should do more He should preserve his quick from
being searched and his core from being probed His marrow too would be
rescued from the piercing it had been so devoutly promised The dread
by which he was now companionedof Malkiel of that portentous and
unseen lady who dwelt beside the secret waters of the Mouse of those
imagined offshoots of the prophetic tree Corona and Capricornusthis
would drop away He would be free once more lighthearted a happy and
mildly intellectual man of the town emerged from the thrall of bogies
and from beneath the yoke which he already felt laid upon his shoulders
by those august creatures who were the centre of the architectural
circle

All these things suddenly presented themselves to the Prophets mind
with extraordinary vividness and force His resolve was taken in a
moment and turning to his eager grandmother and to the still slightly
inflated astronomer he exclaimed without further hesitation

Very well Ill give it up I promise you

Mrs Merillia clapped her mittens together almost like a girl

Thank you Sir Tiglath she cried I knew you would persuade the dear
boy

The astronomer beamed like the rising sun

Let the morning starsfreed from insultsing together he roared

The Prophet glanced towards Lady Enid She was looking almost narrow
and not at all pleased She and all her family had a habit of suddenly
appearing thinner than usual when they were put out This habit had
descended to them from a remote Highland ancestor who had perished of
starvation and been very vexed about it The Prophet felt sure that she
did not applaud his resolution but he could not discuss the matter with
her in public and she now got uplooking almost like a skeletonand
said that she must go Sir Tiglath immediately rolled up out of his
chair and roared that he would accompany her

The old astronomer will protect the injudicious young female he
exclaimed lest she wander forth into accursed places

Im only going to Hill Street said Lady Enid rather snappishly
Come to see me tomorrow at three she whispered to the Prophet as she
took his hand We must have a talk Dont tell anybody

The Prophet nodded surreptitiously He felt that she was curious to her
fingertips as he gently pressed them

When he and his grandmother were alone together he rang the drawingroom
bell Mr Ferdinand appeared

Mr Ferdinand said the Prophet kindly call Gustavus to your aid and
take away the telescope

Sir said Mr Ferdinand in great astonishment

Take away the telescope

Certainly sir Where shall we place it sir

Anywhere said the Prophet In the pantrythe squarein Piccadilly
if you likeits all the same to me

And unable to trust himself to say more he hurried almost tumultuously
from the room

Heres a go Gustavus remarked Mr Ferdinand a moment later as he
entered the servants hall

Where Mr Ferdinand replied Gustavus glancing up from a dish of
tea and a couple of Worthing shrimps with which he was solacing an idle
moment

Here in this mansion Gustavus Me and youve got to take the
telescope out of the drawingroom and Master Hennessey says if we wish
we can chuck it in Piccadilly

The round eyes of Gustavus brightened

That is my wish Mr Ferdinand he exclaimed Heres a lark

He sprang up But Mr Ferdinand checked his very agreeable vivacity

I am your head Gustavus he remarked with severe ambiguity and
master having also said that if we wish we can set the instrument in
the butlers pantry I have decided that so it shall moreover be It
will be very useful to us there

Useful Mr Ferdinand However

Never mind Gustavus never mind replied Mr Ferdinand with some
acrimony

Being of a dignified nature he did not care to explain to a subordinate
that there was a very pleasantlooking secondcook just arrived at the
house of the Lord Chancellor on the opposite side of the square



CHAPTER VII

THE DOUBLE LIFE OF MISS MINERVA

On the following day just as the Prophet was drawing on a new pair of
suede gloves preparatory to setting out to Hill Street Gustavus entered
with a silver salver

A telegram for you sir he said

The Prophet took the blushing envelope ripped it gently open and read
as follows

Madame and self must confer with you this afternoon without fail Shall
be with you five sharp most important

JUPITER SAGITTARIUS


Gustavus nearly dropped at sight of the wrinkles that seamed the
Prophets usually smooth face as he grasped the full meaning of this
portentous missive

Any answer sir

The wrinkles increased and multiplied

Any reply sir

Whatno

Gustavus glided in a welltrained manner towards the door When he got
there the Prophet cried rather sharply

Stop a moment

Gustavus stopped

Sir

TheIerI am expecting aacouple this afternoon began the
Prophet speaking with considerable hesitation and still gazing in a
hypnotised manner at the telegram

A couple sir

Exactly A pair

A pair sir Of horses sir

Horses Noof people that is persons

A pair of persons sir Yes sir

They should arrive towards five oclock

Yes sir

If I should not be home by that time you will show them very quietly
into my librarynot the drawingroom Mrs Merillia is not at present
equal to receiving ordinary guests

The Prophet meant extraordinary but he preferred to put it the other
way

Yes sir What name sir

Mr and Mrsthat is Madame Sagittarius That will do

Gustavus hastened to the servants hall to discuss the situation
while the Prophet stood rereading the telegram with an expression of
shattered dismay Not for at least five minutes did he recover himself
sufficiently to remember his appointment with Lady Enid and when at
length he set forth to Hill Street he was so painfully preoccupied that
he walked three times completely round the square before he discovered
the outlet into that fashionable thoroughfare

When he reached the dark green mansion of Lady Enids worthy father
the Marquis of Glome and had applied the bronze demon that served as a
knocker four separate times to the door he was still so lost in thought
that he started violently on the appearance of the Scotch retainer at
the portal and behaved for a moment as if he were considering which
of two courses he should pursue _ie_ whether he should clamber
frantically into the seclusion of the area or take boldly to the
open street Before he could do either MAllister the retainer had
magnetised him into the hall relieved him of his hatalmost with the
seductive adroitness of a Drury Lane thiefand drawn him down a tartan
passage into a very sensiblelooking boudoir in which Lady Enid was
sitting by a wood fire with a very tall and lusty young man

Mr Hennessey Vivian

What Bobyou here said the Prophet to the lusty young man after
shaking hands a little distractedly with Lady Enid

Yes old chap But Im just off I know you two want to have a confab
returned Mr Robert Green wringing his old school friends hand
Niddys given me the chuck And anyhow Im bound to look in at the Bath
Club at four to fence with Chicky Bostock

Mr Green spoke in a powerful baritone voice rolling his rs and
showing his large and square white teeth in a perpetual cheery and even
boisterous smile He was what is called a thorough good fellow springy
in body and essentially gay in soul That he was of a slightly belated
temperament will be readily understood when we say that he was at
this time just beginning to whistle with fair correctness
Tararaboomdeay to discuss the character of Becky Sharp to dwell
upon the remarkable promise as a vocalist shown by Madame Adelina Patti
and to wonder at the marvellous results said to be accomplished by the
telephone He had also never heard of Christian Science and was totally
unaware that there exists in the metropolis a modest and retiring
building called The Imperial Institute Nevertheless he was
repeatedly spoken of by substantial people as a young man of many parts
was a leading spirit in Yeomanry circles and was greatly regarded by
the Prophet as a trusty friend and stalwart upholder of the British
Empire He had rather the appearance of a bulwark and something of the
demeanour of a flourishing young oak tree

Yes Bob youve got to go assented Lady Enid examining the
Prophets slightly distorted countenance with frank and even eager
curiosity Mr Vivian and I are going to talk of modern things

I know Thackeray and Patti and threevolume novels and skirt
dancing and all the rest of it said Mr Green with unaffected
reverence Well Im off I say Hen pop in at the Bath on your way
home and have a whiskey and soda I shall just be out of the hot room
and

Im sorry Bob said the Prophet with almost terrible solemnity that
I cant thatin factI am unable

What Going to the dentist

Exactlythat is not at all

Well whats up Some intellectual business lecture on Walter Scott
or Dickens or one of the other Johnnies that are so popular just now

No I have aa small gathering at home this afternoon

All right Then Ill pop round on yousay five oclock

No Bob no I cant say that Im very sorry but I cant possibly say
that

Right you are Too clever for me I spose Look me up at the Tintack
tonight thenany time after ten

If I can Bob I will replied the Prophet with impressive
uncertainty I say if I can I will do so

Done If you cant then Im not to expect you That it

That is itprecisely

Goodbye Niddy old girl Keep your pecker up By the way if you
want a real good tune for a Charity singsong a real rouser try Nancy
Lee

He was gone humming vigorously that newfangled favourite

Sit down Mr Vivian said Lady Enid looking her right size Weve
got a lot to say to one another

I have to be home at five replied the Prophet abstractedly

Lady Enid begin to appear a trifle thin

Why How tiresome I didnt think you really meant it

It is very very tiresome

He spoke with marked uneasiness and remained standing with the air of
one in readiness for the punctual call of the hangman

What is it continued Lady Enid with her usual inquisitiveness

I have as I said aa small gathering at home at that hour said the
Prophet repeating his formula morosely

A gatheringwhat of

Peoplepersons that is

Whata party

Two parties replied the Prophet instinctively giving Mr Sagittarius
and Madame their undoubted due Two

Two parties at the same timeand in the afternoon How very odd

They will look very odd veryin Berkeley Square responded the
Prophet in a tone of considerable dejection I dont know Im sure
what Mr Ferdinand and Gustavus will think Still Ive given strict
orders that they are to be let in What else could I do

He gazed at Lady Enid in a demanding manner

What else could I possibly do under the circumstances he repeated

Sit down dear Mr Vivian she answered with her peculiar Scotch
lassie seductiveness and tell me your sincere friend what the
circumstances are

Unluckily her curiosity had led her to overdo persuasion That cooing
interpolation of your sincere friendtoo strongly honeyedsuddenly
recalled the Prophet to the fact that Lady Enid was not and could never
be his confidante in the matter that obsessed him He therefore sat
down but with an abrupt air of indefinite social liveliness and
exclaimed not unlike Mr Robert Green

Well and how are things going with you dear Lady Enid

She jumped under the transition as under a whip

Me Butthese parties you were telling me about

But the Prophet remembered his oath He was a strictly honourable little
man and never swore carelessly

Parties he said You and I are too old friends to waste our life in
chattering about such London nonsense

Then well talk of yesterday said Lady Enid very firmly

The Prophet looked rather blank

Yes she repeated Yesterday Ive guessed your secret

Which one he cried much startled

Which she said reproachfully Oh Mr Vivianand I thought you
trusted in me

The Prophet was silent The third daughter of the clergyman had often
made that remark to him when they were nearly engaged It recalled
bygone memories

Thats what I thought she added with pressure

Im sorry the Prophet murmured rather obstinately

I always think she continued with deliberate expansiveness that
nearly all the miseries of the world come about from people not trusting
inin people

Or from people trusting in the wrong people Which is it said the
Prophet not without slyness

She began to look thin but checked herself

Tell me she said why did you stop me yesterday when I was beginning
to say to Sir Tiglath that I was sure Malkiel was a man and not a
syndicate

Did I stop you said the Prophet artlessly

Yes with your eyes

Becausebecause I was surethat is certain you couldnt be sure

How could you be certain

How

Yes

Well how is one certain of anything said the Prophet rather feebly

How are you certain that Im Miss Minerva Partridge

Because you told me so yourself because Ive seen you come into
Jellybrands for your letters because

Havent I seen Malkiel come into Jellybrands for his

This unexpected retort threw the Prophet upon his beam ends But he
remembered his oath even in that very awkward position

Does he go to Jellybrands he exclaimed with a wild attempt after
astonishment But hes a companySir Tiglath said so

And what did your eyes say yesterday

I had a cold in my eyes yesterday said the Prophet They were very
weak They werethey were aching

Lady Enid was silent for a moment During that moment she was conferring
with her feminine instinct What it said to her must be guessed by
the manner in which she once more entered into conversation with the
Prophet

Mr Vivian she said with a complete change of demeanour to girlish
geniality and impulsiveness Im going to confide in you Im going to
thrown myself upon your mercy

The Prophet blinked with amazement like a martyr who suddenly finds
himself snatched from the rack and laid upon a plush divan with a satin
cushion under his head

Im going to trust you Lady Enid went on emphasising the two
pronouns

Many thanks said the Prophet unoriginally

She was sitting on a square piece of furniture which the Marquis of
Glome called an Aberdeen leanto She now spread herself out upon it
in the easy attitude of one who is about to converse intimately for some
centuries and proceeded

I daresay you know Mr Vivian that people always call me a very
sensible sort of girl

The Prophet remembered his grandmothers remark about Lady Enid

I know they do he assented trying not to think of five oclock

What do they mean by that Mr Vivian

I beg your pardon

I say what do they mean by a sensible sort of girl

Why I suppose

Im going to tell you she interrupted him They mean a sort of girl
who likes fresh air washes her face with yellow soap sports dogskin
gloves drives in an open cart in preference to a shut brougham enjoys
a cold tub and Whyte Melvilles novels laughs at ghosts and cries over
Misunderstood considers the Bishop of London a deity and the Albert
Memorial a gem of art would wear a neat Royal fringe in her grave and
a straw hat and shirt on the Judgment Day if she were in the country for
itwalks with the guns sings Home Sweet Home in the evening
after dinner to her baldheaded father thinks the _Daily Mail_ an
intellectual paper the Royal Academy an uplifting institution the
British officer a demigod with a heart of gold in a body of steel and
the road from Calais to Paris the way to heaven Thats what they mean
by a sensible sort of girl isnt it

I daresay it is said the Prophet endeavouring not to feel as if he
were sitting with a dozen or two of very practised stump orators

Yes and thats what they think I am

And arent you inquired the Prophet

Lady Enid drew herself upon the Aberdeen leanto

No she said decisively Im not Im a Miss Minerva Partridge

Well but what is that asked the Prophet with all the air of a man
inquiring about some savage race

Thats the secret

Oh I beg your pardon

That Im going to tell you now because I trust you

Again the pronouns were emphasised and the Prophet thought how
difficult it would be to keep his oath

And because I know now that youre silly too

The Prophet jumped though not for joy

Ive been Miss Minerva Partridge forwait a moment I must look

She got up went to a writing table opened a drawer in it and took out
a large red book and turned its leaves

My diary she explained Its foolish to keep one isnt it

Her intonation so obviously called for an affirmative that the Prophet
felt constrained to reply

Very foolish indeed

She smiled with pleasure

Im so glad you think so Ahexactly a year and a half

Youve been Miss Minerva Partridge

Yes

So long as that

Yes indeed Mr Vivian during that time I have been leading a double
life

The Prophet remembered the other double life beside the borders of the
River Mouse and began to wonder if he were acquainted with any human
being who led a single one

Many people do that he remarked rather aimlessly

Lady Enid looked vexed

I did not say I had a monopoly of the commodity she rejoined
evidently wishing that she had

Oh no said the Prophet making things worse one meets people who
live double lives every day I might almost say every hour

The clock had just struck four and he had begun to think of five Lady
Enids pleasant plumpness began rapidly to disappear

I cant say I do she said sharply feeling that most of the gilt was
being stripped off her sin

She stopped in such obvious dissatisfaction that the Prophet vaguely
aware that he had made some mistake said

Please go on I am so interested Why have you led a double life for
the last week and a half

Year and a half I said

I mean year and a half

He forced his mobile features to assume a fixed expression of greedy
though rather too constant curiosity Lady Enid brightened up

Mr Vivian she said many girls are born sensiblelooking without
wishing it

Are they really It never occurred to me

Such things very seldom do occur to men Now that places these girls in
a very painful position I was placed in this position as soon as I was
born or at least as soon as I began to look like anything at all For
babies really dont

Thats very true assented the Prophet with more fervour

People continually said to me What a nice sensible girl you are
orOne always feels your Common sense orTheres nothing foolish
about you Enid thank Heaven The Chieftain relied upon me thoroughly
So did the tenants So did everybody You can understand that it became
very trying

Of course of course

Its something to do with the shape of my eyebrows the colour of my
hair the way I smile and that sort of thing

No doubt it is

Mr Vivian Ill tell you now that Ive never felt sensible in all my
life

Really ejaculated the Prophet still firmly holding all his features
together in an unyielding expression of fixed curiosity

Never once however great the provocation And in my family with the
Chieftain the provocation you can understand is exceptionally great

The Marquis of Glome who was the head of a clan called The
MacArdells was always named the Chieftain by his relations and
friends

I felt sure it must be said the Prophet decisively

Nevertheless it is so extremely difficult if not impossible not to
try to be what people take you for that I was in a perpetual condition
of acting sensibly against my true nature

How very trying murmured the Prophet mechanically

It was Mr Vivian It often made me fell quite ill Nobody but you
knows how I have suffered

And why do I know inquired the Prophet

Because I realised yesterday that you must be almost as silly by nature
as I am

Yesterdaywhy When

When you said to Sir Tiglath that you could prophesy

The Prophet stiffened She laughed almost affectionately

So absurd But I was vexed when you said youd give it up You mustnt
do that or youll be flying in the face of your own folly

She drew the Aberdeen leanto which ran easily on Edinburgh castors a
little nearer to him and continued

At least I felt obliged to seek an outlet I could not stifle my real
self for ever and yet I could not be comfortably silly with those who
were absolutely convinced of my permanent good sense I tried to be
several times

Didnt you succeed

Not once

Tch Tch

So at last I was driven to the double life

Then your coachman knows

MacSpillan No I took a caba fourwheelerat the corner of the
Square and the name of Minerva Partridge Its a silly name isnt it

She asked the question with earnest anxiety

Quite idiotic said the Prophet reassuringly

I felt quite sure it was she cried obviously comforted Because it
came to me so inevitably I was so perfectly naturaland alonewhen I
invented it No one helped me

I assure you reiterated the Prophet there is no doubt the name is
absolutely and entirely idiotic

Thank you dear Mr Vivian What a pleasure it is to talk to you Under
this name I have for a year and a half led an idiotic life such a
life as really suits me such a life as is in complete accord with my
true nature Oh the joy of it The sense of freedom If only all other
silly girls who look sensible like me had the courage to do what I have
done

It is a pity said the Prophet in assent beginning to be genuinely
moved by the obvious sincerity of this human beings bent towards
folly But what have you done during this year and a half of truth and
freedom

More foolish things than many crowd into a lifetime she cried
ecstatically It would take me days to tell you of half of them

Oh then you mustnt said the Prophet glancing furtively at the
clock Had you come out to be silly yesterday afternoon

Yes I hadto be sillier even than usual And if it hadnt been
for Sir Tiglath catching sight of me in the avenue and thenMr
Sagittarius and you being in the parlour

She stopped

By the way she said in her usual tone of breezy common sense were
you living a double life in the parlour

I said the Prophet Oh no not at all I never do anything of that
kind

Sure

Quite certain

Youre not going to

Certainly not Nothing would induce me

She looked at him as if unconvinced raising her dark sensible
eyebrows

All Jellybrands clients do she said And Im certain Mr
Sagittarius

I assure you said the Prophet with the heavy earnestness of absolute
insincerity Mr Sagittarius is the most single lived man I ever met
the very most But why did Sir Tiglath that is why did you

Try to avoid him Well

For the first time she hesitated and began to look slightly confused

Well she repeated Sir Tiglath is a very strange peculiar old man

The Prophet thought that if the young librarian had been present he
would have eliminated the second adjective

Peculiar Yes he is His appearance his manner

Oh I dont mean that

No

No Lots of elderly men have purple faces turned legs and roaring
voices You must know that Sir Tiglath is peculiar in this wayhe is
quite elderly and yet hes not in the least little bit silly

Oh

Hes a thoroughly sensible old man the only one I ever met

Your father

The Chieftain can be very foolish at times Thats why hes always
relied so on me

She gave this proof triumphantly The Prophet felt bound to accept it

Sir Tiglath is really as an old man what everybody thinks I am as a
young woman Dyou see

You mean

The opposite of me And in this way too While I hide my silliness
under my eyebrows and hair and smile and manner he hides his
sensibleness under his When people meet me they always thinkwhat a
commonsense young woman When they meet him they always thinkwhat a
preposterous old man

Well but then cried the Prophet struck by a sudden idea if that
is so how can you live a double life as Miss Minerva Partridge You
cant change your eyebrows with your name

Ah you dont know women she murmured No but you see I begin at
once

Begin

Being silly All the people who know me as Miss Partridge know Im
an absurd person in spite of my looks Ive proved it to them by my
actions Ive begun at once before they could have time to judge by my
appearance Ive told them instantly that Im a Christian Scientist
and a believer in the value of tightlacing and in ghosts an
antivaccinator a Fabian a member of The Masculine Club a spirit
a friend of Mahatmas an intimate of the Rational Dress setyou know
who wear things like half inflated balloons in Piccadillya vegetarian
a follower of Mrs Besant a drinker of hop bitters and Zozophine a
Jacobite a hater of false hair and of all collective action to stamp
out hydrophobia a stampcollector an engager of ladyhelps instead
of servants an amateur reciter and skirt dancer an owner of a lock of
Paderewskis hairtorn fresh from the head personally at a concertan
admirer of George Bernard Shaw as a thinker but a hater of him as
a humourist a rationalist and reader of _Punch_ an atheist and
tableturner a friend of all who think that women dont desire to be
slaves a homoeopathist and Sandowite an enemy of babiesas if all
women didnt worship thema lover of catsas if all women didnt hate
one anothera

Oneone moment gasped the Prophet at this juncture Many of these
views are surely in opposition in direct opposition to each other

I daresay That doesnt matter in the least to a real silly woman such
as I am

And then you said that you proved by your actions instantly that

So I did I caught up a happy dog in the street cried over its agony
unmuzzled it and allowed it to add its little contribution to the joy
of life by mangling a passing archdeacon I sat on the floor and handled
snakes I wore my hair parted on one side and smoked a cigarette in a
chiffon gown I refused food in a public restaurant because it had been
cooked by a Frenchman I

Enough Enough cried the Prophet I understand You forced Miss
Partridges acquaintances to believe in Miss Partridges folly But who
were these acquaintances

It would take me hours to tell you First there was

I really have to go at five

Then Ill finish about Sir Tiglath Hes an utterly sensible old man
and so is different from all other old men for you know human folly
increases enormously with age Isnt that lovely Now Mr Vivian Sir
Tiglath admires me

Ah

I know You think that proves him the contrary of what Ive said

Not at all exclaimed the Prophet with frenzied courtesy not at
all

Yes you do But youre wrong He doesnt exactly admire my character
but he likes me because Im tall and have pleasant coloured eyes
and thick hair and walk well and know that hes really an unusually
sensible old man

Oh is that it

Yes But now if he could be made to think that I really am what I look
likea thoroughly sensible young woman he would more than admire me
he would adore me

But if you wish him to asked the Prophet in blank amazement

I do

Why

The Miss Minerva part of me desires it

Indeed

Yes Hes got to do one or two things for Miss Minerva without knowing
that Im Miss Minerva That is why I bolted into the parlour yesterday
Just as I was stepping into Jellybrands I happened to see Sir Tiglath
and he happened to think he saw me

Only to think

Yes He is not certain I saw that by the expression of his face He
was wondering whether I was meor is it Ior not I didnt give him
time to be certain I rushed into the parlour

You did

So its all right Frederick Smith would never betray a client

Really

Never so Im saved For Sir Tiglath isnt certain even now I found
that out on the way home with him last night And an old man whos
uncertain of the truth can soon be made certain of the lie by a young
woman he admires however sensible he is And now Ill tell you part of
what I want Sir Tiglath to do for Miss Minerva

But at this moment the clock struck five and the Prophet bounded up
with hysterical activity and hastily took his leave promising to call
again and hear more on the following day

And tell more thought Lady Enid to herself as the door of the
sensiblelooking boudoir shut behind him



CHAPTER VIII

THE PROPHET RECEIVES HIS DIRECTIONS FROM MADAME

When the Prophet reached his door he rang the bell with a rather
faltering hand Mr Ferdinand appeared

Any one called Mr Ferdinand asked the Prophet with an attempt at
airy gaiety

Yes sir replied Mr Ferdinand looking rather like an elderly maiden
lady when she unexpectedly encounters her cook taking an airing with a
corporal in the Life Guards the pair of persons you expected sir has
come

The Prophet blushed

Oh Youyou havent disturbed Mrs Merillia with them I hope he
rejoined

No sir indeed Gustavus said your orders was that they was to be
shown quietly to the library

Exactly

I begged them to walk atiptoe sir

What ejaculated the Prophet

I informed them there was illness in the house sir

And did theyer

The male person got on his toes at once sir but the female person
shrieks out Is it catching Ho Think ofof Capericornopus sir or
something to that effect

Tch Tch

I took the liberty to say sir that ankles was not catching and
that I would certainly think of Capericornopus if she would but walk
atiptoe

Well and

By hook and cook I got them to the library sir But the male persons
boots creaked awful The getting on his toes sir seemed to induce it
as you might say

Yes yes So theyre in the library

They are sir and have been talking incessant sir ever since they
was put there We can hear their voices in our hall sir

Mr Ferdinand again pursed his lips and looked like an elderly lady The
Prophet could no longer meet his eye

Bring some tea Mr Ferdinand quietly to the library Andand if Mrs
Merillia should ask for me say Imsay Im busyerwriting

Mr Ferdinand moved a step backward

Master Hennessey he cried in a choked voice I a London butler and
you ask me to

No no I beg your pardon Mr Ferdinand Simply say Im busy That
will be quite true I shall bevery busy

Yes sir said Mr Ferdinand with a stern and at length successful
effort to conquer his outraged feelings

He wavered heavily away to fetch the tea while the Prophet like a
guilty thing stole towards the library When he drew near to the door
he heard a somewhat resounding hubbub of conversation proceeding
within the chamber He distinguished two voices One was the hollow
and sepulchral organ of Malkiel the Second the other was a heavy and
authoritative contralto of the buzzing variety which occasionally
gave an almost professional clicksuggesting mechanismas the speaker
passed from the lower to the upper register of her voice As the Prophet
reached the mat outside the door he heard the contralto voice say

How are we to know it really is only ankles

The voice of Malkiel the Second replied plaintively

But the gentleman who opened the door and

The contralto voice clicked and passed to its upper register

You are over fifty years of age it said with devastating compassion
and you can still trust a gentleman who opens doors _O sanctum
simplicitatus_

On hearing this sudden gush of classical erudition the Prophet must have
been seized by a paralysing awe for he remained as if glued to the mat
and made no effort to open the door and step into the room

If I am sanctified Sophronia said the voice of Malkiel I cannot
help it indeed I cant We are as we are

Did Bottom say so in his epics cried the contralto contemptuously
Did Shakespeare imply that when he invented his immortal Bacon or
Carlyle the great Cumberland sage when he penned his worldfamed
Sartus

Praps not my dear You know best Still ordinary mennot that I
of course can claim to be onemust remain to a certain extent what
they are

Then why was Samuel Smiles born

What my love

Why I say Where is the use of effort Of what benefit was Platos
existence to the republic Of what assistance has the great Tracy Tupper
been if men must still despite all his proverbs remain what they are
_O curum hominibus O imitatori Servus pecum_

At this point the voice of Mr Ferdinand remarked in the small of the
Prophets back

Shall I set down the tea on the mat sir or

The Prophet bounded into the library tingling in every vein His
pantherlike entrance evidently took the two conversationalists aback
for Malkiel the Second who had been plaintively promenading about the
room still on his toes according to the behest of Mr Ferdinand
sat down violently on a small table as if he had been shot while the
contralto voice which had been sitting on a saddleback chair by the
hearth simultaneously bounced up both these proceedings being
carried out with the frantic promptitude characteristic of complete and
unhesitating terror

I beg your pardon said the Prophet I hope I havent disturbed you

Malkiel the Second leaned back the contralto voice leaned forward and
both breathed convulsively

I really must apologise continued the Prophet I fear I have
startled you

His guests swallowed nothing simultaneously and mechanically drew out
their handkerchiefs Then Malkiel feebly got up and the contralto voice
feebly sank down again

II thought I said sharp sir remarked Malkiel at length with a
great effort recovering himself

Wasnt I sharp returned the Prophet Will you present me

Are you equal to it my love inquired Malkiel tenderly to the
contralto voice

The contralto voice nodded hysterically

Madame Sagittarius sir said Malkiel turning proudly to the Prophet
my wife the mother of Corona and Capricornus

The Prophet bowed and the lady inclined herself slightly protruding her
elbows as she did so as if just to draw attention to the fact that she
was possessed of those appendages and could use them if necessary

Madame Malkiel or rather Madame Sagittarius as she must for the
present be called was a smallish woman of some forty winters Her hair
which was drawn away intellectually from an ample and decidedly convex
brow was as black as a patent leather boot and had a gloss upon it as
of carefullyadjusted varnish Her eyes were very large very dark and
very prominent Her features were obstreperous and rippling running
from right to left and her teeth which were shaded by a tiny black
moustache gleamed in a manner that could scarcely be called natural
She was attired in a black velvet gown trimmed with a very large
quantity of beadwork a bonnet adorned with purple cherries green
tulips and orangecoloured ostrich tips a pelisse to which bugles had
been applied with no uncertain hand and an opal necklace Her gloves
were of white her boots of black kid the latter being furnished with
elastic sides and over her left wrist she carried a plush reticule
whose mouth was kept shut by a tightlydrawn scarlet riband On the left
side of her pelisse reposed a round bouquet of violets about the size of
a Rugby football

I thought you might like to have some tea began the Prophet in his
most soothing manner while Mr Ferdinand with pursed lips softly
arranged that beverage upon the seat which Mr Sagittariusso we must
call himhad just vacated

Thank you said Madame Sagittarius with dignity It would be
acceptable The long journey from the banks of the Mouse to these
central districts is not without its fatigue A beautiful equipage

You said

You have a very fine equipage

You have seen the brougham said the Prophet in some surprise

What broom buzzed Madame Sagittarius

I thought you were admiring

The tea equipage

Oh yes to be sure Queen Anne silver yes

A great woman said Madame Sagittarius spreading a silk handkerchief
that exactly matched the ostrich tips in her bonnet carefully over
her velvet lap All who have read Mrs Markhams work of genius with
understanding must hold her name in reverence A noble creature A pity
she died

A great pity indeed

Still we must remember that _Mors omnis communibus_ We must not forget
that

No no

And after all it is the will of Providence _Mors Deo_

Quite so

During this classical and historical retrospect Mr Ferdinand had
finished his task and quitted the apartment As soon as he had gone
Madame Sagittarius continued

As the mother of Corona and Capricornus I feel it my duty to ask you
sirthat is Mr

Vivian

Mr Vivian whether the illness in your house is really only ankles as
the gentleman who opened the door assured me

It is only that

Not catching

Oh dear no

There Sophronia said Mr Sagittarius I told you it was merely the
prophecy

He suddenly assumed a formidable manner and continued

And now sir that we are alone

But Madame interrupted him

Kindly permit our host to succour my fatigue Jupiter she said
severely I am greatly upset by the journey When I am restored we can
proceed to business At present I am fit only for consolation

Mr Sagittarius subsided and the Prophet hastily assisted the victim
of prolonged travel to some buttered toast Having also attended to the
wants of her precipitate underling he thought it a good opportunity to
proceed to a full explanation with the august couple and he therefore
remarked with an ingratiating and almost tender smile

I think I ought to tell you at once that there will be no need for
any further anxiety on your part I have put down my telescope and
havewell in fact I have decided once and for all to give up prophecy
for the future

The Prophet in his innocence had expected that this declaration
of policy would exercise a soothing influence upon his guests more
especially when he addedit is to be feared with some insincerity

I have come to the conclusion that I overrated my powers as amateurs
will you know and that I have never really possessed any special
talent in that direction I think I shall take up golf instead or
perhaps the motor car

He spoke deliberately in a lightminded even frivolous manner toying
airily with a sugar biscuit as he leaned back in his chair which stood
opposite to Madame Sagittariuss To his great surprise his wellmeaning
remarks were received with every symptom of grave dissatisfaction by
his illustrious companions Madame Sagittarius threw herself suddenly
forward with a most vivacious snort and her husbands face was
immediately overcast by a threatening gloom that seemed to portend some
very disagreeable expression of adverse humour

That wont do sir at this time of day he exclaimed You should
have thought of that yesterday That wont do at all will it Madame

_O miseris hominorum mentas_ exclaimed that lady tragically _O
pectorae caecae_

You hear her sir continued Mr Sagittarius You grasp her meaning

I do hear certainly said the Prophet beginning to feel that he
really must rub up his classics

She helps Capricornus sir of an evening She assists him in his
Latin Madame is a lady of deep education sir

Quite so But

There can be no going back sir continued Mr Sagittarius Can
there Madame

No human creature can go back said Madame Sagittarius Such is the
natural law as exemplified by the great Charles Darwin in his _Vegetable
Mould and Silkworms_ No human creature can go back Least of all this
gentleman He must go forward and we with him

The Prophet began to feel uncomfortable

But he said

There is no such word as but in my dictionary retorted the lady

Ah an abridged edition no doubt said the Prophet Still

I am better now interposed Madame Sagittarius brushing some crumbs
of toast from her pelisse with the orange handkerchief Jupiter if you
are ready we can explain the test to the gentleman

So saying she drew a vinaigrette set with fine imitation carbuncles
from the plush reticule and applied it majestically to her nose
The Prophet grew really perturbed He remembered his promise to his
grandmother and Sir Tiglath and felt that he must assert himself more
strongly

I assure you he began with some show of firmness no tests will
be necessary My telescope has already been removed from its position
and

Then it must be reinstated sir said Mr Sagittarius and this very
night Madame has hit upon a plan sir of searching you to the quick
Trust a woman sir to do that

I should naturally trust Madame Sagittarius said the Prophet very
politely But I really cannot

So you say sir Our business is to find out whether living in
the Berkeley Square as you do you can bring off a prophecy of any
importance or not The future of myself Madame and family depends upon
the results of the experiments which we shall make upon you during the
next few days

The Prophet began to feel as if he were shut up alone with a couple of
determined practitioners of vivisection

Lets see my dear continued Mr Sagittarius addressing his wife
what was it to be

The honored grandmother one replied the lady tersely

The Prophet started

I cannot possibly consent he began

Pray Mr Vivian listen to me interposed Madame Sagittarius

Pray sir attend to Madame said Mr Sagittarius sternly

But I must really

January said Madame is a month of grave importance to grandmothers
this year is it not Jupiter

Yes my dear In consequence of Scorpio being in the sign of
Sagittarius The crab will be very busy up till the third of February

Just so

At which date the little dog my love assumes the roll of maleficence
towards the aged

I know _Cane cavem_ When was the old lady born Mr Vivian if you
please

What old lady stammered the Prophet beginning to perspire

The old lady whos got ankles your honoured grandmother

On the twentieth of this month But

At what time

Six in the morning But

Under what star

Saturn But

Thats lucky isnt it Jupiter said Madame in an increasingly
businesslike manner That brings her into touch with the
Cameloparddoesnt it

Into very close touch indeed my dear and also with the bull He goes
right to her as you may say

I cannot conceivably permit began the Prophet in much agitation

But Madame without taking the smallest notice of him proceeded

Will the scorpion be round her on her birthday

Close round her my lovewith the serpent They work together

Together do they You know what effect theyll have on her dont you
Jupiter

I should rather think so my darling replied Mr Sagittarius with an
air of profound and sinister information

The Prophets blood ran cold in his veins Yet he felt for the moment
unable to utter a syllable or even to make a gesture of protest
So entirely detached from him did the worthy couple appear to be
so completely wrapped up in their own evidently wellconsidered and
carefullylaid plans that he had a sense of being in another sphere
not theirs of hearing their remarks from some distance off Madame
Sagittarius now turned towards him in a formal manner and continued

And now Mr Vivian I shall have to lay down the procedure that you
will follow Have you a good memoryno a pencil and notebook will be
best _Litterae scriptus manetur_ as we all know full well Have you a
pencil and

The Prophet nodded mechanically

Will you kindly get them

The Prophet rose walked to his writing table and felt for the
implements

If you will sit down now I will direct you continued Madame
authoritatively

The Prophet sat down at the table holding a lead pencil upside down in
one hand and an accountbook wrong side up in the other

Lets seewhats today inquired Madame of her husband

The seventeenth my dear replied Mr Sagittarius looking at his wife
with almost sickly adoration

To be sure Capricornuss day for Homers Idyl Very well Mr Vivian
today being the seventeenth and the old ladys birthday the twentieth
you have three days or rather nights of steady work before you

Steady work murmured the Prophet

What should be his hours Jupiter continued Madame At what time of
night is he to commence Shall I say nine

The Prophet remembered feebly that during the next three nights he had
two important dinnerengagements a party at the Russian Ambassadors
and a reception at the Lord Chancellors just opposite However he made
no remark Somehow he felt that words were useless when confronted with
such an iron will as that of the lady in the pelisse

Nine would be too early my dear said Mr Sagittarius Eleven pm
would be more to the purpose

Eleven let it be then punctually Will you dot down Mr Vivian that
you have to be at the telescope to take observations at eleven pm
every night from now till the twentieth

But I have had the telesc

Kindly dot it down

The Prophet dotted it down with the wrong end of the pencil on the wrong
side of the accountbook

And what are his hours to be exactly Jupiter continued Madame From
eleven till dawn I suppose

The Prophet shuddered

Eleven till three will be sufficient my love The crab you know has
pretty well done his London work by that time And the old lady will
have to depend very much on the crab for these few nights

At this point the Prophets brain began to swim Sparks seemed to float
before his eyes and amid these sparks nebulous and fragmentary visions
appeared visions of his beloved grandmother companioned by scorpions
and serpents in close touch with camelopards and bovine monsters and
in the last stress of terror and dismay left entirely dependent
upon crustaceans for that help and comfort which hitherto her devoted
grandson had ever been thankful to afford

Oh very well replied Madame You will be able to get to bed at
three Mr Vivian Dot that down

Thank you murmured the Prophet making a minute pencil scratch in the
midst of a bill for butchers meat

During these hoursbut you can tell him the rest Jupiter

So saying and with an air of one retiring from business upon a
wellearned competence Madame Sagittarius lay back in her chair
settled her bonnetstrings flicked a crumb from the football of violets
that decorated her left side and extending her kid boots towards
the cheerful blaze that came from the fire fell with a sigh into a
comfortable meditation Mr Sagittarius on the other hand assumed
a look of rather hectoring authority and was about to utter what the
Prophet had very little doubt was a command when there came a gentle tap
to the door

Come in said the Prophet

He thought he had spoken in his ordinary voice In reality he had merely
uttered a very small whisper The tap was repeated

Louder sir louder said Mr Sagittarius encouragingly

Come in shrieked the Prophet

Mr Ferdinand appeared looking more like the elderly spinster lady when
confronted with the corporal in the Life Guards than ever

If you please sir I was to tell you that Lady Enid Thistle is with
Mrs Merillia taking tea Mrs Merillia thought you would wish to know

Madame Sagittarius took the kid boots from the blaze on hearing this
aristocratic name Mr Sagittarius assumed a look of reverence and
the Prophet realised more acutely than ever that even wellborn young
women can be inquisitive

Very well he said Say IllIllhe succeeded in making his voice
sound absolutely firmIll come in a moment

Yes sir

Mr Ferdinand cast a glance of respectful but unlimited horror upon
the Prophets guests and retired while the Prophet calling upon all
his manhood turned to Mr Sagittarius

I regret more than I can say that I shall be obliged now to obey
my grandmothers summons he said courteously Suppose we defer
thisthis pleasant little discussion to some future oc

Impossible sir cried Mr Sagittarius Quite impossible You must
get to work tonight and how can you do it without your directions

Oh I can manage all right said the Prophet desperately I can give
a guess as to

_Non sunt ad astrae mollibus a terrus viae_ cried Madame The road
from Berkeley square to the stars is not so easy is it Jupiter

No indeed my love Why

Then exclaimed the Prophet much agitated and feeling it incumbent
upon him to get rid of Mr Sagittarius at once lest the curiosity of
Lady Enid should increase beyond all measure and lead to an encounter
between the two clients of Jellybrands then kindly give me my
directions as briefly as possible and

There was another tap upon the door

What is it cried the Prophet distractedly Come in

Mr Ferdinand reentered very delicately

Her ladyship can only stay a minute sir Mrs Merillia hopes you can
leave your businessI said as you was very busy sirand come up to
the drawingroom

Yes yes Ill come Say Ill come Mr Ferdinand

Yes sir

As the door closed the Prophet exclaimed excitedly

I fear I really must

Take down your directions sir broke in Mr Sagittarius firmly

Very well rejoined the Prophet desperately seizing his pencil and
the accountbook What are they

You swear to follow them sir

Yes yes anythinganything

Have you a star map

Yesno

You must get one

Very well

You had better do so at the Stores

Madame breathed an almost sensuous sigh which caused her husband to
glance tenderly towards her

I know my love I know he said It may come some day

_O festum dies Longa intervallam_ she murmured shaking her bonnet
with the manner of a martyr to duty

Mr Sagittarius was greatly moved

Shes a saint he whispered aside to the Prophet as if imparting some
necessary information

Certainly Please go on

Mr Sagittarius started as if suddenly recalled to mundane matters

Get it at the Stores he said In the astronomical department

Very well

Having done so and keeping the old lady perpetually in your mind you
will place her in the claws of the crab

What

Mentally sir mentally of course

Oh

And allowing for the natural effect of the scorpion and serpent upon
one of her venerable age

Good Heavens

When close round her as they will bebut you will observe that for
yourself

The Prophet shut his eyes as one who refuses to behold sacrilege

You will trace the cycloidal curve of the planetscan you do that

The Prophet nodded

As it affects her birthday the twentieth Should the lynx be near
her

No no cried the Prophet It shall not be

Well youll have to find that out and keep an eye to it But should
it be you will commit to paper what result its presence is likely to
produce to her and work the whole thing out clearly for myself and
Madame on paperin prophetic form of courseso that we receive it
bywhat post shall I say my dear

First post Jupiter

First post onwhat day is the twentieth

I dont know replied the Prophet helplessly

A Thursday said Madame Capricornuss day for chronic sections

She always knows said Mr Sagittarius to the Prophet

Always

Very well then first post Thursday morning Now is that quite clear

Oh quite quite

You will of course send the old ladys horoscope to us at the same time
with full particulars

Full particulars said the Prophet What of

Of her removal from the bottle cutting of her first tooth short
coating going into skirts putting of the hair up day of marriage and
widowhood illnesses

Especially the rashes Jupiter struck in Madame

What a mind said Mr Sagittarius aside to the Prophet

What

Especially as Madame says any illnesses taking the form of a rashthe
epidemic form as I may sayand so forth We are to receive this
document by the first post Thursday morning

Have you dotted all that down Mr Vivian inquired Madame

The Prophet hastily made a large variety of scratches with the lead
pencil

And now continued Mr Sagittarius

There was a third tap at the door

Come in cried the Prophet distractedly and feeling as if homicidal
mania were rapidly creeping upon him

Mr Ferdinand appeared once more with a mouth like a purse

Her ladyship says she really must go in a moment sir andand Mrs
Merillia begs that

I am coming at once Mr Ferdinand I swear it Go upstairs and swear I
swear it

Yes sir

Mr Ferdinand departed rather with the demeanour of an archbishop who
has been inveigled into pledging himself on his archiepiscopal oath to
commit some horrid crime The Prophet turned almost violently towards
his guests

I must go he cried I must indeed Pray forgive me You see how I am
circumstanced Permit me to show you to the door

You swear sir to carry out all our directions and to dot down

I do I swear solemnly to dot downif you will onlythis way Take
care of the mat

We trust you Mr Vivian said Madame with majestic pathos A wife
a mother trusts you _Placens uxus Mater familiaris_

I pledge my honour This is theno no not that way not that way

The worthy couple by mistake no doubt were proceeding towards the
grand staircase having missed the way to the hall door and as the
Prophet following them up with almost unimaginable activity drew near
enough to drum the right direction into their backs Lady Enid became
visible on the landing above Mr Sagittarius perceived her

Why its Miss Minerv he began

This way this way cried the Prophet wheeling them round and driving
them but always like a thorough gentleman towards the square

Then she leads a double life too said Mr Sagittarius solemnly
fixing his strained eyes upon the Prophet

She Who said Madame sharply

She had not seen Lady Enid

All of us my love all of us returned her husband as the Prophet
succeeded in shepherding them on to the pavement

Goodbye he cried

With almost inconceivable rapidity he shut the door As he did so
two vague echoes seemed to faint on his ear One was male
a dreamlikeFirst post Thursday The other was female a
fairylike_Jactum alea sunt_



CHAPTER IX

THE PROPHET BEGINS TO CARRY OUT HIS DIRECTIONS

Mr Ferdinand said the Prophet the same evening after he had dressed
for dinner what has become of the telescope

He spoke in a low voice not unlike that of a confirmed conspirator and
glanced rather furtively around him as if afraid of being overheard

I have removed it sir according to your orders replied Mr
Ferdinand also displaying some uneasiness

Yes yes Where have you placed it

Well sir I understood you to say I might throw it in Piccadilly if I
so wished

The Prophet suddenly displayed relief

I see You have done so

Well no sir

The Prophets face fell

Then where is it

Well sir for the moment I have set it in the butlers pantry

Indeed

I thought it might be of use there sir continued Mr Ferdinand
in some confusion which however was not noticed by the Prophet Of
great use toto Gustavus and me inin our duties sir

Quite so quite so returned the Prophet abstractedly

Did you wish it to be taken to the drawingroom again sir

The Prophet started

Certainly not he said On no account As you very rightly saya
butlers pantry is the place for a telescope It can be of great service
there

His fervour surprised Mr Ferdinand who began to wonder whether by
any chance his master knew of the Lord Chancellors agreeablelooking
secondcook After pausing a moment respectfully Mr Ferdinand was
about to decamp when the Prophet checked him with a gesture

One moment Mr Ferdinand

Sir

One moment

Mr Ferdinand stood still The Prophet cleared his throat arranged his
tie and then said with an air of very elaborate nonchalance

At what time do you generally go to bed Mr Ferdinand when you dont
sit up

Sometimes at one time sir and sometimes at another

Thats rather ambiguous

I beg pardon sir

What is your usual hour for being quitethat is entirely in bed

Entirely in bed sir

Mr Ferdinands fine bass voice vibrated with surprise

Yes Not partially in bed but really and truly in bed

Well sir returned Mr Ferdinand with decided dignity when I am in
bed sir I am

And whens that

By twelve sir

I thought as much cried the Prophet with slightly theatrical
solicitude You sit up too late Mr Ferdinand

I hope sir that I

Thats what makes you so pale Mr Ferdinand and delicate

Delicate sir cried Mr Ferdinand who had in fact been hopelessly
robust from the cradle totally incapable of acquiring even the most
universal complaints and moreover miraculously exempt from that
wellrecognised affliction of the members of his profession so widely
known as butlers feet

Yes said the Prophet emphatically You should be in bed thoroughly
in bed by a quarter to eleven And Gustavus too He is young and the
young cant be too careful Begin tonight Mr Ferdinand I speak for
your healths sake believe me

So saying the Prophet hurried away leaving Mr Ferdinand almost as
firmly rooted to the Turkey carpet with surprise as if he had been woven
into the pattern at birth and never unpicked in later years

At ten that evening the Prophet having escaped early from his dinner on
some extravagant plea of sudden illness or second gaiety stood in the
small and sober passage of the celebrated Tintack Club and inquired
anxiously for Mr Robert Green

Yes sir Mr Green is upstairs in the smokeroom said the
functionary whom the club grew under glass for the benefit of the
members and their friends

Sam show this gentleman to Mr Green

Sam who was a redfaced child in buttons with a mans walk and the
back of one who knew as much as most people obeyed this command and
ushered the Prophet into a room with a sealingwax red paper in which
Robert Green was sitting alone smoking a large cigar and glancing at
the stonybroke edition of an evening paper He greeted the Prophet
with his usual unaffected cordiality offered him every drink that had
yet been invented and on his refusal of them all handed him a cigar
and a matchbox and whistled Tararaboomdeav at him in the most
friendly manner possible

Bob said the Prophet taking a very long time to light the cigar
what in your opinion is the exact meaning of the term honour

Mr Greens cheerful though slightly belated face assumed an
expression of genial betwaddlement

Oh well Hen he said exact meaning you knows not so easy
Buthang it we all understand the thing eh without sticking it down
in words What

I dont Bob rejoined the Prophet in the tone of a man at odds with
several consciences In what direction does honour lie

It dont lie at all old chap said Mr Green with the decided manner
which had made him so universally esteemed in yeomanry circles

The Prophet began to look very much distressed

Look here Bob Ill put it in this way he said Would an honourable
man feel bound to keep a promise

Rather

Yes but would he feel bound to keep two promises

Rather if hed made em

Suppose he had

Go ahead Hen Im supposing said Mr Green beginning to pucker
his brows and stare very hard indeed in the endeavour to keep the
supposition fixed firmly in his head

And further suppose that these two promises were diametrically
opposed to one another

Mr Green stuck out one leg looked obliquely at the carpet pressed his
lips together and nodded

So that if he fulfilled them both hed have to break them both

Stop a sec Gad Ive lost it Start again Hen

No I mean so that if he didnt break one he would be forced to break
the other Have you got that

Stop a bit Dont believe I have Lets see

He moved his lips silently repeating the Prophets words

Yes Ive got that all right now he said after three minutes of
strenuous mental exertion

Well what would you say of him

That he was a damned fool

The Prophet looked very much upset

No no Bob I meant to him What would you say to him

That he was a damned fool

The Prophet began to appear thoroughly broken down However he still
stuck to his interpellation

Very well Bob he said with unutterable resignationas of a toad
beneath the harrowbut putting all that aside

Give us a chance Hen Ive got to shunt all that have I

Yes at least all you would say of and to the man

Oh only that Wait a bit Yes Ive done that Drive on now

Putting all that aside what should you advise the man to do

Not to be such a damned fool again

No no I mean about the two promises

What about em

Which would his sense of honour compel him to keep

I shouldnt think such a damned foold got a sense of honour

The Prophet winced but he stuck with feverish obstinacy to his point

Yes Bob he had

I dont believe it Hen pon my word I dont Youll always find that
damned f

Bob I must beg you to take it from me He had Now which promise
should he keep

Whod he made em to

Who said the Prophet wavering

Yes

One toto a very near and dear relative the other towell Bob to
two comparative strangers

What sort of strangers

The sort of strangers whowho live beside a river and whowho mix
principally withwell in fact with architects and their wives

Rum sort of strangers

They are decidedly

Oh then you know em

Thats not the point exclaimed the Prophet hastily The point is
which promise is to be kept

I should say the one made to the relative Wait a bit though Yes I
should say that

The Prophet breathed a sigh of relief But some dreadful sense of
honesty within him compelled him to add

I forgot to say that hed pledged his honour to the architectsthat
is to the strangers who lived beside a river

Whatand not pledged it to the relative

Well no

Then he ought to stick to the promise hed pledged his honour over of
course Nice for the relative The mans a damned fool Hen Do have a
drink old chap

Thus did Mr Robert Green drive the Prophet to take the first decisive
step that was to lead to so many complicationsthe step towards Mr
Ferdinands pantry

At precisely a quarter to eleven pm the Prophet stood upon his
doorstep and very gently indeed inserted his latchkey into the door
A shaded lamp was burning in the deserted hall where profound silence
reigned Clear was the night and starry As the Prophet turned to close
the door he perceived the busy crab and the thought of his beloved
grandmother sinking now to rest on the second floor all unconscious of
the propinquity of the scorpion the contiguity of the serpent filled
his expressive eyes with tears He shut the door stood in the hall and
listened He heard a chair crack the ticking of a clock There was no
other sound and he felt certain that Mr Ferdinand and Gustavus had
heeded his anxious medical directions and gone entirely to bed betimes
leaving the butlers pantry free for the nocturnal operations of the
victim of Madame For he recognised that she was the guiding spirit of
the family that dwelt beside the Mouse He might have escaped out of
the snare of Mr Sagittarius but Madame was a fowler who would hold
him fast till she had satisfied herself once and for all whether it were
indeed possible to dwell in the central districts within reach of the
Army and Navy heaven in Victoria Street and yet remain a prophet Yes
he must now work for the information of her ambitious soul He sighed
deeply and went softly up the stairs His chamber was on the same floor
as Mrs Merillias and as he neared her door he rose instinctively
upon his toes and grasping the tails of his evening coat firmly with
his left hand to prevent any chance rustling of their satin lining and
bearing his George the Third silver candlestick steadily to control any
clattering of its extinguisher he moved on rather like a thief who
was also a trained ballerina holding his breath and pressing his lips
together in a supreme agony of dumbness

Unluckily he tripped in the raised pattern of the carpet the
candlestick uttered a silver note his pentin breath escaped with a
loud gulp and Mrs Merillias delicate voice cried out from behind her
shut door

Hennessey Hennessey

The Prophet bit his lip and went at once into her room

Mrs Merillia looked simply charming in bed with her long and elegant
head shaded by a beautiful muslin helmet trimmed with lace and a
delicious embroidered wrapper round her shoulders The Prophet stood
beside her shading the candleflame with his hand

Well grannie dear he said what is it You ought to be asleep

I never sleep before twelve Have you had a pleasant dinner

Very Stanyer Phelps the American was there and very witty And we
had a marvellous _supreme de volaille_ Everybody asked after you

Mrs Merillia nodded like an accustomed queen who receives her due She
knew very well that she was the most popular old woman in London knew
it too well to think about it

Well goodnight grannie

The Prophet bent to kiss her his heart filled with compunction at the
thought of the promise he was about to break It seemed to him almost
more than sacrilegious to make of this dear and honoured ornament of
old age a vehicle for the satisfaction of the vulgar ambitions and
disagreeable curiosity of the couple who dwelt beside the Mouse

Goodnight my dear boy

She kissed him then added

You like Lady Enid dont you

Very much

So does Robert Green He thinks her such a thoroughly sensible girl

Bob Does he said the Prophet concealing a slight smile

Yes If you want her to get on with you Hennessey you should come up
to tea when she is here

I couldnt today grannie

You were really busy

Very busy indeed

I suppose you only saw her for a moment on the stairs

That was all

It was true for Lady Enid had scarcely stayed to speak to the Prophet
having hurried out in the hope of discovering who were the two parties
he had been entertaining on the ground floor

Mrs Merillia dropped the subject

Goodnight Hennessey she said Go to bed at once You look quite
tired I am so thankful you have given up that horrible astronomy

The Prophet did not reply but as he went out of the room he knew for
the first time what criminals with consciences feel like when they are
engaged in following their dread profession

As he walked across the landing he heard a clock strike eleven He
started hastened into his room tore off his coat replaced it with
a quilted smokingjacket sprang lightly to his table seized a
planisphere or starmap which he had succeeded in obtaining that
night from a small working astronomers shop in the Edgeware Road
and mindful of the terms of his oath and the decided opinion of Robert
Green scurried hastily but very gingerly down the stairs This time
Mrs Merillia did not hear him She had indeed become absorbed in a new
romance written by a very rising young Montenegrin who was just then
making some stir in the literary circles of the elect

Very surreptitiously the Prophet tripped across the hall and reached
the stout door which gave access to the servants quarters But here he
paused Although he had lived in Mrs Merillias most comfortable home
for at least fifteen years he had actually never once penetrated
beyond this door It had never occurred to him to do so Often he had
approached it Quite recently when Mrs Fancy Quinglet had broken
into tears on the refusal of Sir Tiglath Butt to burst according to
her prediction he had handed her to this very portal But he had never
passed through it nor did he know what lay beyond No doubt there was
a kitchen very probably the mysterious region of watery activities
commonly known as a scullery quite certainly a butlers pantry But
where each separate sanctum lay and what should be the physiognomy of
each one the Prophet had not the vaguest idea As he turned the handle
of the door he felt like Sir Henry Stanley when that intrepid explorer
first set foot among the leafy habitations of the dwarfs

As the door opened the Prophet found himself in a large apartment whose
walls were decorated with the efforts of those great painters who feed
the sentimental imaginations of the masses in the beautiful Christmas
numbers of our artistic day Enchanting little girls and exceedingly
human dogs observed his entrance from every hand while such penetrating
and suggestive legends as Dont bite Mustnt Naughty Would
ums and the like filled his mind with the lofty thoughts so suitable
to the Christmas season Over the mantelpiece was a _Cooks Almanac for
the Home_ decorated in bright colours a _Butlers own book_ bound
in claretcoloured linen and a large framed photograph of Francatelli
that immortal _chef_ whose memory is kept green in so many kitchens and
whose recipes are still followed as are followed the footprints of the
great ones in the Everlasting Sands of Time One corner of the room
Gustavus had made his own and here might be seen his tasteful whatnot
and his little libraryneatly arranged unabridged farthing editions
of Drummonds _Ascent of Man_ Mills _Liberty_ Cramptons _Origin of
SelfRespect_ Barlows _A Philosophical Examination into the Art and
Practice of Tipping and Receiving Tips_ and other volumes suitable
for an intellectual footmans reading An eightday clock which was
carefully and lovingly wound up by the prudent Mrs Fancy Quinglet every
morning and evening snored peacefully in a recess by the hearth and
from a crevice near the window the bright intelligent eyes of a couple
of welldeveloped blackbeetlesmother and soncontentedly surveyed
the cheerful scene

The Prophet after a moments pause of contemplation passed on through
a swing door covered with green baize and down some stairs to the
inner courts of this interesting region This time he came to anchor in
a room which he thought might well have been a butlers pantry had it
contained a largesized telescope It was in fact the parlour set apart
for the use of the kitchen and scullery maids and was brightly fitted
up with a dresser a cupboard for skewers a rollingpin a basting
machine and other similar adjuncts It gave on to the kitchen in which
the cat of the house was enjoying wellearned slumber in the attitude of
a black ball So far his exploring tour had quite fulfilled the rather
vague expectations of the Prophet but he now began to feel anxious
Time was passing on and he had sworn to be at the telescope by eleven
sharp He had therefore already slightly fractured his oath and he
had no desire to earn the anathema of all such men as Robert Green by
breaking it into small pieces Where was the butlers pantry He glanced
eagerly round the kitchen perceived a door passed through it and
found himself confronted by a sink He had gained the scullery but not
his goal To the right of the sink was yet another door through which
the Prophet who carried the planisphere in one hand the George the
Third candlestick in the other rather excitedly debouched into a
goodsized passage As he did so he heard the muffled alto voice of the
eightday clock proclaim that it was a quarterpast eleven Feeling that
he was now upon the point of breaking both the promises of the damned
fool the Prophet hastened along the passage darted through the first
outlet and found himself abruptly face to back with what appeared at
first glance to be an enormously broad and bowlegged dwarf with a bald
head and a black tail coat which in an attitude of savage curiosity
was gazing through a gigantic instrument whose muzzle projected from an
open window into a spacious area So great was the Prophets surprise
so supreme the shock to his whole nervous system occasioned by this
unexpected encounter that he did not utter a cry His amazement carried
him into that terrible region which lies beyond the realms of speech
He simply stood quite still and gazed at the bowlegged dwarf which
in its turn continued to gaze savagely through the gigantic instrument
into the area Not for perhaps three or four minutes did the Prophet
realise that this dwarf was merely an ingeniously shortened form of Mr
Ferdinand who with his legs very wide apart and making two accurate
right angles at their respective kneejoints his head thrown well
back and his arms arranged in two perfect capital Vs with the elbows
pointing directly at the walls on either side of him had been busily
engaged for the last hour and a quarter in trying to focus firstly the
Lord Chancellors house on the opposite side of the square and secondly
the pleasantlooking secondcook in it That his chivalrous efforts had
not yet been crowned with complete success will be understood when we
say that he had seen during his first halfhour of contemplation nothing
at all during his second halfhour the lefthand top star of the Great
Bear and finally the fourth spike from the end of the iron railing
which enclosed the square garden at which he had been gazing closely
for precisely fifteen minutes and a half when the Prophet darted into
the pantry

Having at length recovered from his shock of surprise sufficiently to
realise that the enormous and immobile dwarf was Mr Ferdinand and that
Mr Ferdinand was not yet aware of his presence the Prophet resolved
to beat a rapid and noiseless retreat He carried this resolve into
execution by turning sharply round knocking his head against a plate
chest firing the George the Third candlestick into the passage and
letting the planisphere go into the china jar of Butlers own special
pomade which Mr Ferdinand kept always open for use upon the pantry
table

To say that Mr Ferdinand ceased from looking through the telescope for
the Lord Chancellors secondcook at this juncture would perhaps not
convey quite a fair idea of the activity which he could on occasion
display even at his somewhat advanced age It might be more just to
state that without wasting any precious time in useless elongation he
described an exceedingly rapid circular movement still preserving the
shortened form of himself which had so deceived and startled his master
and brought his eye from the orifice of the telescope to a level with
the Prophets knees exactly at the moment when the Prophet rebounded
from the plate chest into the centre of the apartment

Oh is it you Mr Ferdinand said the Prophet controlling every
symptom of anguish with the exception of a rapid flutter of the
eyelids I was looking forfor a bradawl

The Prophets choice of this useful little implement as the reason for
his presence in Mr Ferdinands special sanctum was prompted by the fact
that just as he was speaking he happened to see a bradawl lying upon a
neighbouring knife cupboard in the company of a corkscrew

And here I see is just what I want he added calmly

So far he had displayed extraordinary composure but at this point he
made a slight mistake for he picked up the corkscrew and sauntered
quietly away with it into the darkness leaving Mr Ferdinand still in
the attitude of a Toby jug the planisphere still head downwards in
the butlers own special pomade and the George the Third candlestick
stretched at full length upon the passage floor

CHAPTER XI

MISS MINERVA OPENS HER BOOK OF REVELATION IN A CAB

Assure the Lord Chancellor that the last boy has been and gonegone
away that is Mr Ferdinand and that I pledge my sacred word not to
have another telegram today

Yes sir His lordship desired that you should be informed that
according to the law regulating public abominations and intolerable
street noises you was liable to

I know I know

And that by the Act dealing with gross offences against the
public order and scandalous crimes against the peace of metropolitan
communities you was amenable

Exactly Go to his lordship and swear

I couldnt do that so soon again sir really I swore only as short
ago as yesterday sir by your express order but

I mean asseverate to his lordship that the very last boy has knocked
for the very last time

It wasnt so much the knocking sir his lordship complained of as
the boys coming to the door meeting the boys going away from it and
blocking up the pavement sir so that no one could get past and

Yes yes Go and asseverate at once Mr Ferdinand

Very well sir And Her Grace the Duchess of Camberwell who is
passing from one fit to another sir from fright at the uproar and
telegrams going to the wrong house sir

Implore Her Grace to have courage and to trust me as a gentleman when I
promise solemnly that the knocking shall not be renewed

Very well sir

Mr Ferdinand

Sir

Have the knockers swathed in cottonwool at once

Yes sir

Andfix a bulletin on the door Wait Ill write it

The Prophet hastened to his writing table and with a hand that trembled
violently wrote on a card as follows

Owner of this house seriously ill pray do not knock or _death_ shall
certainly ensue

There Poor grannie will have peace now Nail that up Mr Ferdinand
under the cottonwool

Very well sir Mrs Merillia sir would be glad to speak to you for a
moment You remember I informed you

Ill go to her at once But first bring me a glass of brandy Mr
Ferdinand Im feeling extremely unwell

And the Prophet who was paler far than ashes and beaded from top to
toe with perspiration sank down feebly upon a chair and let his head
drop on the blottingpad that lay on his writingtable

When he had swallowed an inch or two of cognac he got up pulled himself
together with both hands and walked like an elderly person afflicted
with incipient locomotor ataxy upstairs into the drawingroom where
Mrs Merillia was lying on a sofa ministered to by Fancy Quinglet who
at the moment of his entrance was busily engaged in stuffing a large
wad of cottonwool into the right ear of her beloved mistress

Leave us please Fancy said Mrs Merillia in a voice that sounded
much older than usual And as your head is so bad too you had better
lie down

Thank you maam If I keep upright maam I feel my head will split
asunder I cant speak different nor feel other

Then dont be upright

No maam Them that feels other let them declare it and Mrs Fancy
retired holding both hands to her temples and uttering very distinctly
sundry stifled moans

Mrs Merillia motioned the Prophet to a chair and after lying quite
still for about five minutes with her eyes tightly shut said in a weak
tone of voice

How many more telegrams do you expect Hennessey You have had
twentyseven within the last three hours Can you give me a rough
general idea of the average number you anticipate will probably arrive
every hour from now till the offices close

Grannie grannie forgive me I assure you

Dont be afraid to tell me Hennessey It is much better to know
the worst and fact it bravely Will the present average be merely
sustained or do you expect the quantity to increase towards night
because if so

Grannie there will be no more I swear to you solemnly that I will
not have another telegram today I will not upon my sacred honour
Nothingnot wild horses evenshall induce me

Horses Then were they racing tips Hennessey Yes give me the _eau de
Cologne_ and fan me gently Were they racing tips

Oh grannie how could you suppose

At this moment Mr Ferdinand entered softly and went up to Mrs
Merillia

Mr Q Elisha Hubsbee maam He is deeply distressed and asks for news
  

The Central American Ambassadors grandfather said Mrs Merillia
reading the card which Mr Ferdinand handed to her

Shocked to hear you are so ill that a knock will finish you Guess
you must be far gone Earnest sympathy Have you tried patent morphia
molasses

Q E H


Ah how things get about Tell Mr Elisha Hubsbee the knocks have
nearly killed us all Mr Ferdinand but we are bearing up as well as
can be expected If necessary we will certainly try the molasses

Yes maam

It is two oclock now Hennessey The Charing Cross office is open till
midnight I believe so at the present rate you should only have about
ninety more telegrams today But if you have reason to expect

Mr Ferdinand reentered

Mrs Hendrick Marshall has called maam She desired me to say she was
passing the door and was much horrified to find that you are so near the
point maam

What point Mr Ferdinand

Of death maam She had no idea at all maam

Oh thank Mrs Hendrick Marshall Mr Ferdinand and say we shall try
to keep from the point for the present

Yes maam

That the numbers will go up as the afternoon draws on Hennessey

Grannie havent I sworn and have you ever known me to tell you a

Suddenly the Prophet stopped short thinking how that very night he
would be forced by his oath to Madame and self to break his promise
to his grandmother how already it would have been broken had not Mr
Ferdinand on the previous night been in possession of the telescope

The Chancellor of the Exchequer maam desires his compliments and
he begs you to last out if possible till he has fetched Sir William
Broadbent to see you He is going there on his bike maam and had no
conception you was dying till he knew it this moment maam

Thank the Chancellor Mr Ferdinand and say that though we must all go
out some day I have no desire for a dissolution at present and shall do
my best to prove myself worthy of my constitution

Yes maam

Mr Ferdinand retired brushing away a tear

It would not be feasible I suppose Hennessey to station Gustavus
permanently at the telegraph office with a small hamper so that he
might collect the wires in it as they arrive and convey them here once
an hour or so entering by the area door I thought perhaps that might
obviate

Mr Ferdinand once more appeared looking very puffy about the eyes

If you please maam Laady Julia Posostlethwaite is below and
asks wheether you are truly going maam

Going Where to Mr Ferdinand

The other plaace maam Her ladyship is crying something
terrible maam and says till she nononoticed the fact she had
nononotion you was leaving us so soon maam

Here Mr Ferdinand uttered a very strange and heartrending sound that
was rather like the bark of a dog with a bad cold in its head

It is really very odd so many people finding out so soon said Mrs
Merillia in some surprise Tell her ladyship Mr Ferdinand that

But at this moment there was the sound of feet on the stairs and Lady
Enid Thistle hurried into the room closely followed by Mr Robert
Green Lady Enid went up at once to Mrs Merillia

I am so shocked and distressed to see your news dear Mrs Merillia
she cried affectionately But she added with much inquisitiveness
is it really true that if anyone tapped on the door you would certainly
die How can you be so sure of yourself

What do you mean Ah Mr Green how dyou do See my news

Yes written up on the front door Everyones shocked

Rather said Mr Green gazing at Mrs Merillia with confused
mournfulness One doesnt see death on a front door every day dont
you know in big round hand too and then one of those modern words

Death on the front door in big round hand said Mrs Merillia in the
greatest perplexity

I put it there grannie said the Prophet humbly I wrote that if
another boy knocked death would certainly ensue

Ensue Thats it I knew it was one of those modern words said Mr
Green

Another boy said Lady Enid Why should another boy knock

Hennessey receives about nine telegrams an hour answered Mrs
Merillia

Really

Lady Enid looked at him with keen interest while Mrs Merillia
continued

You had better take death off the door now Mr Ferdinand I feel more
myself Please thank her ladyship and tell her so

Yes maam

Nine telegrams an hour repeated Lady Enid Mr Vivian would
you mind just seeing me as far as Hill Street Bob has to go to
Tattersalls

Have I Niddy asked Mr Green with evident surprise

Yes to pick up a polo pony Dont you recollect

A polo pony was it By Jove

I will come with pleasure said the poor Prophet who felt fit only to
lie down quietly in his grave If you dont mind being left grannie

Mrs Merillia was looking pleased

No no Go with Lady Enid my dear boy If any telegrams come shall I
open

No cried the Prophet with sudden fierce energy For mercys sakeI
mean grannie dear that none will come If they shouldhis ordinary
gentle eyes flamed almost furiouslyMr Ferdinand is to burn them
unreadyes to ashes I will tell him And he escorted Lady Enid
tumultuously downstairs missing his footing at every second step

In the square they parted from Mr Green who said

Goodbye Niddy old girl What do I want to pick up at Tattersalls

A polo pony Bob she answered firmly

Oh a polo pony Thanks Chin chin Hen Polo pony is it

He strode off whistling She wore a wreath of roses in a puzzled
manner but still preserving the accepted demeanour of a bulwark

As soon as Mr Green was out of sight Lady Enid said

We arent going to Hill Street

Arent we replied the Prophet feebly

No I must see Sir Tiglath Butt today I want you to take me to his
door

Where is his door

In Kensington Square Do you mind hailing a fourwheeler We can talk
privately there No one will hear us

The Prophet hailed a growler wondering whether they would be able to
hear each other As they got in Lady Enid after giving the direction
said to the cabman who was a short person with curling ebon whiskers
a brokenup expression and a brokendown manner

Drive slowly please and Ill give you an extra sixpence

Lydy

Drive slowly and Ill give you another sixpence

How did yer think I was gawing to drive lydy

I wonder why cabmen are always so interested in ones inmost thoughts
said Lady Enid as the horse fell down preparatory to starting

I wonder

I hope he will go slowly

He seems to be doing so

At this point the horse after knocking on the front of the cab with his
hind feet ten or a dozen times got up hung his head and drew a large
number of deep and dejected breaths

Am I gawing slowly enough lydy asked the cabman anxiously

Yes but you can let him trot along now

Right lydy I aint preventing of him

As eventually they scrambled slowly forward in the Kensington direction
Lady Enid remarked

Why dont you have them sent to Jellybrands

Have what asked the Prophet

Your telegrams The messages from your double life I do

But I assure you

Mr Vivian its useless really I find you hidden away in the inner
room of Jellybrands with Mr Sagittarius closely guarded by Frederick
Smith fourpenny champagne

Four bobshilling I mean

Oh was itUpon the table After Ive been poisoned and we are
leaving Mr Sagittarius calls after you such expressions as Banks of
the Mousehear from memarrowarchitects and the last day You are
obviously agitated by these expressions We reach your house I find
you have been prophesying through a telescope The name of Malkiela
wellknown prophetis mentioned You turn pale and glance at me
imploringly as if to solicit my silence I am silent The next day you
announce that you are going to have two afternoon parties

No no not afternoon I never said afternoon interposed the Prophet
frantically as the horse fell down again in order to earn the extra
sixpence

Well two parties in the afternoon Its the same thing You say they
are odd You yourself acknowledge it You tell me you have secrets

Did I

Yes When I said I had guessed your secret you replied Which one

Oh murmured the Prophet trying not to say come in to the horse
which was again knocking with both feet upon the front of the cab

You go home I call during the afternoon and find that you are
entertaining all your guests in your own little room and that your
grandmother knows nothing of it and believes you to be working As I
am leaving I see the backs of two of your guests One is a pelisse the
other a spotted collar As I near them they mount into a purple omnibus
on which is printed in huge letters _To the Pork Butchers Rest_

No No ejaculated the Prophet pale with horror at this revelation

_Rest_ Crampton Vale N I lose them in the shadows The next day
I call and find your grandmother is dying from the noise made by boys
bringing you private telegrams And then you tell me meMinerva
Partridgethat you have no double life Yes you can let him get up
now please

The cabman permitted the horse to do so and they again struggled
funereally forward The Prophet was still very pale

I suppose it is useless tovery well he said My life is double

Ah

But only lately quite lately

Never mind that Oh How glad I am that you have had the courage
too You will soon get into it as I did But you should have all your
telegrams and so forth directed to Jellybrands

Its too late replied the Prophet dejectedly Too late I do wish
that horse wouldnt fall down so continually Its most monotonous

The poor man naturally wants the extra sixpence I think I shall give
him a shilling But now who is Mr Sagittarius

Who is he

Yes Ive seen him several times at Jellybrands and when I first met
him I though he was an outside broker

You Was it on the pier at Margate

Certainly not Really Mr Vivian even in my double life I
occasionally draw the line

I beg your pardon Ithe horse confuses me

Well hes stopped knocking now and will be up in another minute Who
did you say Mr Sagittarius was

I didnt say he was anybody but hes a man

Id guessed that

And an acquaintance of mine

Yes

Im afraid its going to rain

It generally does in Knightsbridge Yes

Is Sir Tiglath likely to be in

He knows Im coming Well you havent told me who Mr Sagittarius is

Lady Enid said the Prophet desperately I know very little of Mr
Sagittarius beyond the fact that hes a man which Ive already informed
you of

Is he an outside broker

No

Then hes Malkiel You cant deny it

I can deny anything said the Prophet who already upset by the
events of the day was now goaded almost to desperation I can andand
must Theres the horse down again

I shall have to give the man one and sixpence Are your going to keep
your promise to Mrs Merillia and Sir Tiglath

To this question the Prophet determined to give a direct answer in
order to draw Lady Enid away from the more dangerous subjects

No he said with a spasm of pain

I knew you wouldnt be able to

Why

Because when ones once been really and truly silly its impossible not
to repeat the act absolutely impossible Youll never stop now Youll
go on from one thing to another as I do

I cannot think that prophecy is silly said the Prophet with some
stiffness

She looked at him with frank admiration

Youre worse than I am Its splendid

Worse

Why yes Youre foolish enough to think your silly acts sensible I
wish I could get to that Then perhaps I could impose on Sir Tiglath
more easily too

She considered this idea seriously as they started on again and
gradually got free of the little crowd that had been sitting on the
horses head

I must impose upon him she said And youve got to help me

I cried the Prophet feeling terribly unequal to everything I
cannot possibly consent

Yes dear Mr Vivian you can And if two thoroughly silly people cant
impose upon one sensible old man it will be very strange indeed And
now Im going to tell you what I hadnt time to tell you yesterday

She leaned forward and tapped sharply on the rattling glass in front of
the cab The cabman bending down twisted his whiskers towards her

Dont go too fast

I cant get im to fall down agyne lydy Es too tired

I daresay But dont let him walk quite so fast

She drew back

Mr Vivian she saidand the Prophet thought she had never looked
more sensible than now as she began this revelationMr Vivian among
the silly people I have met in my dear double life who do you think are
the very silliest

The antivaccinators

No Besides they so often have smallpox and become quite sensible

The atheists

I used to think so but not now And most of those I knew are Roman
Catholics at present

The women who dont desire to be slaves

There arent any

The tearers of Paderewskis hair

I so seldom meet them because they all live out in the suburbs

The tightlacers

They get red noses poor things and disappear Theyre not permanent
enough to count as the very silliest

I give it up

The Spiritualists and the Christian Scientists Thats why I love them
best and spend most of my double life with them How you would get on
with them How much at ease you would be in their midst

Really But arent they in opposite camps

Dear things They often think so I believe But really they arent
Half the Christian Scientists begin as Spiritualists And a great many
Spiritualists were once Christian Scientists

Which are you

Both of course

Dear me

As you will be when youve got thoroughly into your double life Well
my greatest friendin my double life you understandis a Mrs Vane
Bridgeman a Christian Scientist and Spiritualist She is very rich
and magnificently idiotic She supports all foolish charities She has
almshouses for brokendown mediums on Sunnington Common in Kent She
has endowed a hospital for sick fortunetellers She gave five hundred
pounds to the home for indigent thoughtreaders and nearly as much to
the Palmists Seaside Retreat at Millaby Bay near Dover I dont know
how many Christian Science Temples she hasnt erected or subscribed
liberally to She turns every table in her house She wont leave even
one alone Her early breakfasts for stargazers are famous and its
impossible to dine with her without sitting next to a horoscopecaster
or being taken into dinner of courseby a crystal diviner or a
noseprophet

A noseprophet Whats that

A person who tells your fortune by the shape of your nose

Oh I see

Well you understand now that theres no sillier person in London than
dear Mrs Bridgeman

Oh quite

Shes done a great deal for me more than I can ever repay

Indeed

Yes in introducing me to the real inner circles of idiotcy Well in
return Ive sworn

You too

What do you mean

Oh nothing I beg your pardon Please go on

She looked at him curiously and continued

Ive swornthat is pledged my honour you know

I know I know

To introduce her to at least one thoroughly sensible persona man she
prefers

And youve chosen

Sir Tiglath because hes the only one I know Once I confess I
thought of you

Of me

Yes but of course I didnt really know you then

She looked at him with genuine regard The Prophet scarcely knew whether
to feel delighted or distressed

Now you see Mr Vivian if Sir Tiglath found out for certain that I
was Miss Minerva he might discover my double life and if he did that
he is so sensible that I am sure he would never speak to me again and I
could not fulfil my vow to dear Mrs Bridgeman

I quite see

Nor my other vow to myself

Which one

Oh never mind

I wont

He only said that about partridges in January I find because he
happened to see one of my letters in Jellybrands window He doesnt
associate that letter with me So it ought to be all right and Ive
arranged my campaign

But what can I

She smiled at him with some Scottish craft

Dont bother Youve got to be my aidedecamp thats all Ah here we
are

For at this moment the horse with a great effort succeeded in falling
down for the last time before the astronomers door



CHAPTER XII

THE ELABORATE MIND OF MISS MINERVA

On being shown by an elderly housekeeper with a Berlin wool fringe
into an oldfashioned oval bookroom Lady Enid and the Prophet
discovered the astronomer sitting there _teteatete_ with a muffin
which lay on a china plate surrounded by manuscripts letters
pamphlets books and blottingpaper He was engaged in tracing lines
upon an immense sheet of foolscap with the aid of a ruler and a pair
of compasses and when he perceived his visitors he merely rolled his
glassy eyes at them shook his large head as if in rebuke and then
returned to his occupation without uttering a word

Lady Enid was in nowise abashed She looked more sensible even than
usual and at once commenced her campaign by the remark

I know you wonder why I wanted to see you this afternoon Sir Tiglath
Well Ill tell you at once Mr Vivian has persuaded me to act as his
ambassador

At this very unexpected statement the Prophet started and was about
to utter what might perhaps have taken the form of a carefullyworded
denial when Lady Enid made a violent face at him and proceeded in a
calm manner

He wishes you to do something for him and he has confessed to me that
he does not quite like to ask you himself

On hearing these words the Prophets brain already sorely tried by the
tragic duel which had taken place between himself and the couple who
lived beside the Mouse temporarily collapsed He attempted no protest
His mind indeed was not in a condition to invent one He simply sat down
on a small pile of astronomical instruments which with some scientific
works an encyclopaedia and a pair of carpet slippers occupied the
nearest chair and waited in a dazed manner for what would happen next

Sir Tiglath continued measuring and drawing lines with a very thin pen
and Lady Enid proceeded further to develop her campaign

Mr Vivian tells me she said that he has a very old and dear friend
who is most anxious to make your acquaintancenot of course for any
idle social purpose but in order to consult you on some obscure point
connected with astronomy that only you can render clear Isnt this so
Mr Vivian

The Prophet shifted uneasily on the astronomical instruments and
grasping the carpet slippers with one hand to steady himself in answer
to an authoritative sign from Lady Enid feebly nodded his head

But Lady Enid continued apparently warming to her lies Mr Vivian
and his friend knowing how much your time is taken up by astronomical
research and how intensely valuable it is to the world at large have
not hitherto dared to intrude upon it although they have wished to do
so for a very long time and have even made one attemptat the Colley
Cibber Club

The Prophet gasped Sir Tiglath took a bit out of the muffin and
returned to his tracing and measuring

On that occasion you may remember Lady Enid went on with increasing
vivacity and assurance you declined to speak This naturally damped
Mr Vivianwho is very sensitive though you might not think ithere
she cast a glance at the instruments on which the Prophet satand his
friend So much so in fact that unless I had undertaken to act for
them I daresay they would have let the matter drop Wouldnt you Mr
Vivian she added swiftly to the Prophet

Certainly he answered like a creature in a dream Certainly

More especially as the friend Mrs Vane Bridgemanthe Prophet at
this point made an inarticulate but very audible noise that might have
meant anything and that did in fact mean Merciful Heavens what
will become of meMrs Vane Bridgeman is also of a very retiring
disposition and would hate to put such a man as you are to the slightest
inconvenience

Sir Tiglath took another bite at the muffin which seemed to be getting
the worst of the _teteatete_ rummaged among the mess of things that
loaded his table till he found a gigantic book opened it and began to
compare some measurements in it with those he had made on the foolscap
paper His brickred face glistened in the light of the lamp that stood
beside him His moist red lips shone and he seemed totally unaware that
there was anyone in the chamber endeavouring to gain his attention

In these circumstances Sir Tiglath Lady Enid went on with pleasant
ease and a sort of homespun selfpossession that trumpeted like a
military band her sensibleness Mr Vivian consulted me as to what to
do whether to give the whole thing up or to make an appeal to you at
the risk of disturbing you and taking up a little of your precious time
When he had explained the affair to me however I at once felt certain
that you would wish to know of it Didnt I Mr Vivian Didnt I say
only this afternoon that we must at once take a fourwheeler to Sir
Tiglaths

Yes you did said the Prophet in a muffled voice

For I knew that no investigation no serious reverent investigation
into heavenly that is starry conditions could be indifferent to you
Sir Tiglath

The astronomer who had been in the act of lifting the last morsel
of the muffin to his mouth put it down again and Lady Enid thus
vehemently encouraged went on more rapidly

You know of Mr Vivians interest almost more than interest in the
planets This interest is shared was indeed prompted by Mrs Bridgeman
a woman of serious attainments and a cultivated mind Isnt she Mr
Vivian

The Prophet heard a voice reply Oh yes she is He often wondered
afterwards whether it was his own

It seems that she during certain researches hit upon an idea with
regard towell shall I say with regard to certain starswhich she
communicated to Mr Vivian in the hope that he would carry it further
and in fact clear it up Didnt she Mr Vivian

Oh yes she did said a voice to which the Prophet again listened
with strained attention

It was in connection with this idea that Mr Vivian developed his
enthusiasm for the telescopewhich led him perhaps a little too far
Sir Tiglath but Im sure Mrs Merillia and you have quite forgotten
that

Here Lady Enid paused and the astronomer achieved the final conquest of
the muffin

He and Mrs Bridgeman have been in fact working together she being
the brain as it were and Mr Vivian the eye Youve been the eye Mr
Vivian

Ive been the eye

But despite all their ardour and assiduity they have come to a sort
of deadlock In these circumstances they come to you making meas
your may I say intimate friendtheir mouthpiece

Here Lady Enid paused rather definitely and cast a glance of apparently
violent invitation at the Prophet as if suggesting that he must now
amplify and fill in her story As he did not do so a heavy silence fell
in the room Sir Tiglath had returned to his measuring and Lady Enid
for the first time began to look slightly embarrassed Sending her eyes
vaguely about the apartment as people do on such occasions she chanced
to see a newspaper lying on the floor near to her She bent down towards
it then raising herself up she said

Mrs Bridgeman some time ago came to the conclusion that there was
probably oxygen in certain stars and not only in the fixed stars

At this remark the astronomers countenance completely changed He swung
round in his revolving chair wagged his huge head from side to side
and finally roared at the Prophet

Is she telling the truth

I beg your pardon said the Prophet bounding on the instruments

Get off those precious tools young man far more valuable than your
finite carcase Get off them this moment and answer meis this young
female speaking the truth

The Prophet got off the instruments and in answer to a firm Scottish
gesture from Lady Enid nodded his head twice

What continued Sir Tiglath puffing out his cheeks a woman be a
pioneer among the Heavenly Bodies

The Prophet nodded again as mechanically as a penny toy

The old astronomer is exercised bawled Sir Tiglath with every
symptom of acute perturbation He is greatly exercised by the narrative
of the young female

So saying he heaved himself up out of his chair and began to roll
rapidly up and down the room alternately distending his cheeks and
permitting them to collapse

I should tell you also Sir Tiglath interposed Lady Enid as if
struck by a sudden idea that Mrs Bridgemans original adviser and
assistant in her astronomical researches was a certain Mr Sagittarius
who is also an intimate friend of Mr Vivians

The Prophet sat down again upon the instruments with a thud

Get off those precious tools young man roared the astronomer
furiously Would you impose your vile body upon the henchmen of the
stars

The Prophet got up again and leaned against the wall

I feel unwell he said in a low voice Exceedingly unwell I regret
that I must really be going

Lady Enid did not seem to regret this abrupt indisposition Perhaps she
thought that she had already accomplished her purpose At any rate she
got up too and prepared to take leave The astronomer was still in
great excitement

Who is this Mr Sagittarius he bellowed

A man of science Isnt he Mr Vivian

Yes

An astronomer of remarkable attainments Mr Vivian

Yes

One knows not his abnormal name cried the astronomer

He is very modest very retiring Mrs Bridgemans is really the only
house in London at which you can meet him Isnt that so Mr Vivian

Yes

You say he has made investigation into the possibility of there being
oxygen in many of the holy stars

Mr Vivian

Yes

The old astronomer must encounter him exclaimed Sir Tiglath puffing
furiously as he rolled about the room

Mr Vivian will arrange it Lady Enid said with sparkling eyes at
Mrs Bridgemans Thats a bargain Come Mr Vivian

And almost before the Prophet knew what she was doing she had
maneuvered him out into Kensington Square and was pioneering him
swiftly towards the High street

Well take a hansom home she said gaily and the man can drive as
fast as ever he likes

In half a minute the Prophet found himself in a hansom bowling along
towards Mayfair The first words he said when he was able to speak
were

WhyMr Sagittariusoh why

Lady Enid smiled happily

It just struck me while I was talking to Sir Tiglath that I would
introduce Mr Sagittarius into the affair

Oh why

Whybecause it seemed such an utterly silly thing to do she
answered Didnt it

The Prophet was silent

Didnt it she repeated A thing worthy of Miss Minerva

It seemed to the Prophet just then as if Miss Minerva were going to
wreck his life and prepare him accurately for a future in Bedlam

And besides you wouldnt tell me who Mr Sagittarius was she added

The Prophet began to realise that it is very dangerous indeed to deny
the curiosity of a woman

What a mercy it is Lady Enid continued lightly that Malkiel is a
syndicate instead of a man If he wasnt and Sir Tiglath ever got to
know him he would try to murder him and how foolish that would be
It would be rather amusing though to see Sir Tiglath do a thoroughly
foolish thing wouldnt it

The Prophets blood ran cold in the cab as he began for the first
time to see clearly into the elaborate mind of Miss Minerva into the
curiously deliberate complications of a definite and determined folly
He perceived the danger that threatened the prophet who dwelt beside the
Mouse but he had recovered himself by this time sufficiently to meet
craft with craft And he therefore answered carelessly

Yes it is lucky that Malkiels a syndicate

When they reached Hill street Lady Enid said

Im so much obliged to you Mr Vivian for all youve done for Miss
Minerva

Not at all

The next step is to introduce you to Mrs Bridgeman and you can
introduce her to Mr Sagittarius Then Ill introduce Sir Tiglath to
her and she will introduce Mr Sagittarius to him It all works out so
beautifully Thank you a thousand times Youll hear from me Probably
Ill give you your directions how to act tomorrow Goodnight

The Prophet drove on to Berkeley Square feeling that between Mr and
Madame Sagittarius and Miss Minerva he was being rapidly directed to
his doom



CHAPTER XIII

THE PROPHET IS INTERVIEWED BY TWO KIDS

Mr Ferdinand met the Prophet in the hall

I have done as you directed sir he said respectfully

As I directed Mr Ferdinand I was not aware that I ever directed
anybody replied the Prophet suspecting irony

I understood you to say sir that if any more telegrams was to arrive
I was to burn them sir

Telegrams Good Heavens You dont mean to say that

There has been some seventeen or eighteen sir I have burnt them sir
to ashes according to your orders

Quite right Mr Ferdinand said the Prophet putting his hand up to
his hair to feel if it were turning grey Quite right How ishow I
say is Mrs Merillia

Well Master Hennessey shes not dead yet

And Mr Ferdinand with a contorted countenance moved towards the
servants hall

The Prophet stood quite still with his hat and coat on for several
minutes An amazing selfpossession had come to him the unnatural
selfpossession of despair He felt quite calm as the statue of a dead
alderman feels on the embankment of its native city Nothing seemed to
matter at all He might have been Marcus Aureliustill a loud double
knock came to the front door Then he might have been any dangerous
lunatic ripe for a strait waistcoat Mr Ferdinand approached The
Prophet faced him

Kindly retire Mr Ferdinand he said in a very quiet voice I will
answer that knock

Mr Ferdinand retired rather rapidly The knock was repeated The
Prophet opened the door A telegraph boy about two and a half feet
high stood outside upon the step

Telegram sir he said in a thin voice

Give it to me my lad replied the Prophet

The small boy handed the telegram and turned to depart

Wait a moment my lad said the Prophet very gently

The small boy waited

Do you wish to be strangled my lad asked the Prophet

The small boy tried to recoil but his terror rooted him firmly to the
spot

Do all the other boys at the office wish to be strangled continued
the Prophet Come my lad why dont you answer me

No sir whispered the small boy passing his little tongue over his
pale lips

Very well my lad the next boy who brings a telegram to this house
will be strangled do you understand that

Yes sir sighed the small boy like a terrorstricken Zephyr

Thats right Goodnight my lad

The Prophet closed the street door very softly and the small boy
dropped fainting on the pavement and was carried to the nearest hospital
on a stretcher by two dutiful policemen

Meanwhile the Prophet opened the telegram and read as follows

Insufferable insolence How dare you shall pay dearly with you
tomorrow first bus

JUPITER AND MADAME SAGITTARIUS


Mr Ferdinand called the Prophet

Yes sir

I am about to write a telegram Gustavus will take it to the office

Yes sir

The Prophet went into the library and wrote these words on a telegraph
form

Jupiter Sagittarius Sagittarius Lodge Crampton St Peter N Your
life is in danger keep where you are another telegram may destroy you
Grave news

VIVIAN


The Prophet gave this telegram to Gustavus and then prepared to go
upstairs to his grandmother As he mounted towards the drawingroom he
murmured to himself over and over again

Sir TiglathMalkiel MalkielSir Tiglath

He found Mrs Merillia very prostrate It seemed that the telegraph boys
had very soon worn through the cottonwool with which the knocker had
been shrouded and that the incessant noise of their efforts to
attract attention at the door had quite unnerved the gallant old lady
Nevertheless her own condition was the last thing she thought of

I dont mind for myself Hennessey she said But it is very
sad after all these years of respect and even I think a certain
popularity to be considered a nuisance by ones square We are
hopelessly embroiled with the Duchess of Camberwell and the Lord
Chancellor has sent over five times to explain the different laws and
regulations that we are breaking I dont see how you can go to his
Reception tonight really

I am not going grannie said the Prophet overwhelmed with
contrition I cannot go in any case

Why not

II have some work to do at home

He avoided the glance of her bright eyes and continued

Grannie I am deeply grieved at all you have gone through today
Believe me it has not been my faultat least not entirely I may have
been injudicious but I nevernever

He paused quite overcome with emotion

I dont know what will happen if the telegrams go on till midnight
said Mrs Merillia The Duke of Camberwell is a very violent man since
he had that sunstroke at the last Jubilee and I shouldnt wonder if
he

Grannie there will not be any more telegrams

But you said that before Hennessey

And I say it again There will not be any more I have just informed
the messenger that the next boy who knocks will certainly bewell
destroyed

Mrs Merillia breathed a sigh of relief

I am so thankful Hennessey Are you dining out tonight

No grannie I dont feel very well I have a headache I shall go and
lie down for a little

Yes do Everybody is lying down Fancy the upper housemaid the cook
Even Gustavus they tell me is trying to snatch a little uneasy repose
on his whatnot It has been a terrible day

Mrs Merillia lay back and closed her eyes and the Prophet overwhelmed
with remorse retired to his room lay down and stared desperately at
nothing for half an hour He then ate with a very poor appetite a
morsel of dinner and prepared to take if possible a short nap before
starting on the labours of the night As he got up from the dining table
to go upstairs he said to Mr Ferdinand

By the way Mr Ferdinand if I should come into the pantry again
tonight dont be alarmed I may chance to require a bradawl as I did
last night Kindly leave one out in case I should But you need not sit
up

As the Prophet said the last words he looked Mr Ferdinand full in the
face The butlers eyes fell

Thank you Master Hennessey I shall be glad to get to bedentirely to
bedin good time We are all a bit upset in the kitthat is the hall
today

Just so Retire to rest at once if you like

Thank you sir

Gustavus said Mr Ferdinand a moment later in the servants hall
you are a man of the world I believe

Gustavus roused himself on his whatnot

I am Mr Ferdinand he replied in a pale and exhausted manner

Then tell me Gustavus have you ever lived in service with a gentleman
who was partial to a bradawlof a night you understand

No never Mr Ferdinand The nearest to it ever I got was the Bishop
of Clapham

Explain yourself Gustavus I beg

He used to ask for a nip sometimes before retiring Mr Ferdinand

A nip Gustavus

Warm water with a slice of toast in it But he was only what they call
a suburban bishop Mr Ferdinand

Ah a nip is hardly on all fours with a bradawl Gustavus

Praps not Mr Ferdinand but its the nearest ever I got to it

Mr Ferdinand said no more but when he retired to rest that night
he doublelocked his door and dreamt of bradawls till he woke
unrefreshed the next morning to find the area full of telegrams

Meanwhile the Prophet was conscientiously fulfilling his promise and
keeping the oath he had pledged his honour over although he had to
work under a grave disadvantage in the total loss of his planisphere or
starmap

He entered the butlers pantry precisely on the stroke of eleven and
found it to his great relief untenanted The dwarf was no longer
at the telescope and the silence in the region dedicated to Mrs
Merillias menials was profound The night too was clear and starry
propitious for prophetic labours and as the Prophet gazed out upon the
deserted square through the open window a strange peace descended upon
his fevered soul Nature with all her shining mysteries her distant
reticences and revelations calmed the turmoil within him He looked
upon the area railings and upon the sky and smiled

Then he looked for the starmap He perceived in a very prominent
position upon a silver salver the bradawl laid out according to
order by the obedient Mr Ferdinand He perceived also the open pot of
Butlers Own Special Pomade but the planisphere had been removed from
it Where could it have been bestowed The Prophet instituted a
careful search He explored cupboards drawerssuch at least as were
unlockedin vain He glanced into a silver teapot reposing on a shelf
between the pages of an almanac hanging on the wall among some back
numbers of the _Butlers Gazette_ which were lying in a corner But the
planisphere was nowhere to be found and at last in despair he resolved
to do without it and to trust to his fairly accurate knowledge of the
heavens He therefore took up his station by the window and proceeded
to extract from the pocket of his smokingjacket the accountbook in
which he had dotted down the directions of Madame and self They were
very vague for his dots had been agitated Still by the help of the
George the Third candlestick in which was a lighted taper the Prophet
was able to make out enough to refresh his memory He was to begin by
placing his beloved grandmother in the claws of the crab Leaning upon
the sill of the window he found the crab andbreathing a short prayer
for forgivenesscommitted his dear relation to its offices He then
retreated and assuming very much the position of Mr Ferdinand applied
his right eye to the telescope at the same time holding his left eye
firmly shut with the forefinger of his left hand At once the majesty of
the starry heavens burst upon him in all its glory

Exactly at halfpast one oclock two hours and a half later the
enthralled Prophet heard a low whistle which seemed to reach him from
the square He withdrew his fascinated right eye from the telescope and
endeavoured to use it in an ordinary manner but he could at first see
nothing The low whistle was repeated It certainly did come from the
square and the Prophet approached the open window and once more tried
to compel the eye that had looked so long upon the stars to gaze with
understanding upon the earth This time he perceived a black thing like
a blot about six feet high beyond the area railings From this
blot came a third whistle The Prophet who was still dazed by the
fascination of stargazing mechanically whistled in reply whereupon
the blot whispered at him huskily

At it again are you

Yes whispered the Prophet also huskily for the night air was cold
But how should you know

Indeed he wondered and it seemed to him as if the blot were some
strange night thing that must have companioned him invisibly when he
kept his nocturnal watches in the drawingroom and that now partially
revealed itself to him in the perhaps more acutely occult region of
the basement

How should I know rejoined the blot with obvious though very hoarse
irony Whatever dyou take me for

The Prophet began to wonder but before he had gone on wondering for
more than about half a minute the blot continued

Shes gone to bed

I know she has said the Prophet presuming that the blot which
seemed instinct with all knowledge was referring to his grandmother

But she knows youre at it again continued the blot

The Prophet started violently and leaned upon the windowsill

No How can that be he ejaculated

Ho Them girls knows everything especially the old uns said the
blot with an audible chuckle

Good gracious gasped the Prophet overwhelmed at this mysterious
visitants familiar description of his revered grandmother

Have you seen her tonight inquired the blot controlling its
merriment

Yes said the Prophet With the Crab

What cried the blot in obvious astonishment Them instruments must
be wonderful sightcarriers

They are exclaimed the Prophet with almost mystic enthusiasm
Wonderful I have seen her with the Crab distinctly

Ah well I told her she ought to keep away from it continued the
blot

Did you said the Prophet with increasing surprise But how could
she

Ah thats just it She couldnt

No of course not

She was drawn right to it

She was It wasnt her fault It was the Crabs

A pity it was dressed

What

I say its a pity twas dressed

What was dressed

What why the Crab

The Crabdressed

Ay Theyre a deal safer not dressed

Are they

She knows it too

Does she

But therethem women likes a spice of danger Shes in a nice state
now you bet Not much sleep for her Ill lay Well I tried to keep
her from it so you neednt blame me

I wont said the Prophet feeling completely dazed

Well gonight Im off round the square

Goodnight said the Prophet

Suddenly a blinding flash of light dazzled his eyes He covered them
with his hands When he could see again the blot was gone

Although he was retired to rest that night when the clock struck three
the Prophet did not sleep His nervous system was in a condition of
acute excitement His brain felt like a burning ball and the palms of
his hands were hot with fever For the spirit of prophecy was upon him
once more and he was bound fast in the golden magic of the stars Like
the morphia maniac who after valiant fasting returning to his drug
feels its influence the stronger for his abstinence from it the Prophet
was conscious that the heavens held more power more meaning for him
because for a while he had intended to neglect them He was ravaged by
their mystery their majesty and revelation

When he came down in the morning pale dishevelled but informed by a
curious dignity he was met at once by Mr Ferdinand

I have cleared the area sir said the functionary

The area Mr Ferdinand What of

Telegrams sir The boys must have thrown em down without knocking

Very probably replied the Prophet Their comrade was right They did
not wish to be strangled

No sir And I have placed them in a basket on the breakfast table
sir while awaiting your orders

Quite right Mr Ferdinand By the way here is the bradawl Leave it
out again tonight in case I have need of it

So saying the Prophet handed the bradawl which he had craftily
conveyed from the pantry on the previous night to the astonished butler
and walked swiftly into the breakfastroom The basket of telegrams was
set outside beside a fried sole and the equipage which Madame had so
much admired and while he sipped his tea the Prophet opened the wires
one by one They were fraught with terror and dismay Evidently his
mysterious warning had thrown the worthies who dwelt beside the Mouse
into a condition of the very gravest amazement and alarm and they had
despite the Prophets final injunction spent the remaining telegraphic
hours of the day in despatching wires of frantic inquiry to the square
Madame in particular was evidently much upset and expressed her angry
agitation in a dead language that seemed positively to live again in
fear and novelty of grammatical construction Sir Tiglath had been
a brilliant card to play in the prophetic game although he had not
achieved the Prophets purpose of stopping the telegraphic flood

While the Prophet was simultaneously finishing the fried sole and the
perusal of the final wire Mr Ferdinand entered in a condition of
obvious astonishment that might well have cost him his place

If you please sir he said in an upanddown voice if you please
there are twotwotwo

Two what Be more explicit Mr Ferdinand

Twowell sir kids at the door waiting for you to see them sir

Two kids Whatfrom the goat show thats going on at the Westminster
Aquarium cried the Prophet in great surprise

Maybe sir I cant say indeed sir Am I to show them in sir

Show them in Are you gone mad Mr Ferdinand They must be driven
out at once If Mrs Merillia were to see them she might be greatly
alarmed IllIllfollow me Mr Ferdinand closely

So saying the Prophet stepped valiantly into the hall There by the
umbrella stand stood two small children boy and girl very neatly
dressed in a sailor suit and a grey merino The little boy held in his
hand a large round straw hat on the blue riband of which was inscribed
in letters of gold HMS Hercules The little girl wore a pleasant
pigtail tied with a riband of the same hue

The meaning of Mr Ferdinands vulgar and misleading slang suddenly
dawned on the Prophet He cast a look of very grave rebuke on Mr
Ferdinand then walking up to the little boy and girl he said in his
most ingratiating manner

Well my little ones what can I do for you

Not so little if you please Mr Vivian replied the boy in a piping
but very selfpossessed voice Can we see you in private for a moment

If you please Mr Vivian added the little girl Si sit prudentium

Dentia Corona corrected the little boy

The Prophet turned white to the very lips

Certainly certainly he said in a violently furtive manner Come
this way my children Mr Ferdinand if Mrs Merillia should inquire
for me you will say that Im busy writingno no just busyvery
busy

Yes sir

Im not to be disturbed This way my little ones

Not so little Mr Vivian piped again the small boy trotting
obediently with his sister into the Prophets library the door of
which was immediately closed behind them

Well Im said Mr Ferdinand Kids in the library I amGustavus

He rushed frenetically towards the servants hall to confer upon the
situation with his intellectual subordinate

Meanwhile the Prophet was closeted with the two kids

Pray sit down he said very nervously and smiling forcibly Pray
sit down my dears

The kids obeyed with aplomb keeping their large and strained eyes fixed
upon the Prophet

Is it Coronus and Capricorna continued the Prophet with an effort
after blithe familiarity Is it

No piped the little boy It isnt Coronus and Capricorna

A marvellous sensation of relief invaded the Prophet

Thank Heaven he ejaculated in a sigh I thought it must be

Its Corona and Capricornus continued the little boy And weve
brought you a letter from pater familias

And mater familiaris added the little girl

Milias Corona corrected the little boy Here it is Mr Vivian
he added drawing a large missive from the breast of his blueandwhite
sailors blouse Pater and mater familias couldnt bring it themselves
because he said it wasnt safe for him to come and shes lying down ill
at what you sent to her It wasnt kind of you was it

So saying he handed the missive to the Prophet who took it anxiously

Would you like some cake my litI mean my dears while I read this

No thank you Cake is bad for us in the morning replied the little
boy You shouldnt eat it so early

The Prophet was about to reply that he never did when it struck him that
argument would probably be useless He therefore hastened to open
the letter which proved to be from Mr Sagittarius and which ran as
follows

SIRYour terrible and mysterious wire coming after your equally
terrible and mysterious silence has caused devastation in a hitherto
peaceful and happy family To what peril do you allude What creature
can there be so base as to wish to take my life merely on account of
my sending you telegrams Madame has been driven to despair by your
announcement and I myself although no ordinary man am very rightly
and properly going about in fear of my life since receipt of your last
telegram Under these circs and being unable to wait upon you ourselves
for a full explanation we are sending our very lifeblood to youper
rail and buswith strict orders to bring you at once to the banks
of the Mouse there to confer with Madame and self and arrange such
measures of precaution as are suited to the requirements of the
situation as indicated by you

JUPITER SAGITTARIUS

PSYou are to bring with you according to solemn oath all prophecy
concerning grandmother Crab etc gathered up to date together with
full details of sames removal from the bottle cutting of her first
tooth shortcoating going into skirts putting of hair up day of
marriage and widowhood illnessesespecially rashesand so forth _Ab
origino_

MADAME SAGITTARIUS


On reading this communication the Prophet felt that all further struggle
was useless Fatecruel and remorseless Fatehad him in her grasp
He could only bow his head and submit to her horrible decrees He could
only go upstairs and at once prepare for the journey to the Mouse

He laid the letter down and got up fixing his eyes upon the kids who
sat solemnly awaiting his further procedure

YouI suppose you know my little ones what thiswhat you have to
do he said

Not so little if you please Mr Vivian returned the boy Yes
weve got to take you with us to see pater familias

And mater familiarfamilias added the little girl

I seeyou know said the Prophet in a despairing voice Very well
Wait here quietlyvery quietly while I go and get ready

And please dont forget the Crab and grandmother rashes et ceterus
said the little girl

Tera Corona piped her brother

I wont said the Prophet I will not

And he tottered out of the room carrying the Sagittarius letter in his
hand

In the hall he paused for a moment holding on to the balusters and
rereading his directions Then he crawled slowly up the stairs and
sought his grandmothers room



CHAPTER XIV

THE PROPHET JOURNEYS TO THE MOUSE

Mrs Merillia was just beginning to recover from the prostration of the
preceding day when the Prophet came into the room where she was seated
with Mrs Fancy Quinglet She looked up at him almost brightly but
started when she saw how agitated he seemed

Grannie said the Prophet abruptly you would tell me anything
wouldnt you

Why of course my dear boy But what about

Aboutabout yourself

Mrs Merillia looked very much astonished

There is nothing to hide Hennessey she said with gentle dignity
You know that

I do I do cried the Prophet passionately Yours has been the best
the sweetest life the world has ever known

Well I dont wish to imply

But I do grannie I do Can Fancy leave us for a moment

Certainly Fancy you can go to your tatting

Yes maam

Mr Hennessey has something to explain to me

Oh maam the houses that have been broke up by explainings

And with this as the Prophet thought appallingly appropriate
exclamation Mrs Fancy hurried feverishly from the room

Now what is the question you wish to ask me Hennessey said Mrs
Merillia with a soft dignity

There areone momentthere are eight questions grannie responded
the Prophet shrinking visibly before the dread necessity by which he
found himself confronted

Eight So many

Yes oh indeed yes

Well my dear and what are they

The first isisgrannie when were you removed fromfrom the
bottle

A very delicate flush crept into Mrs Merillias charming cheeks

The bottle Hennessey Never never she said with a sort of pathetic
indignation How could you supposeIthe bottle

Her pretty old voice died away

Answered darling grannie answered ejaculated the Prophet
Pleaseplease dont And nowyour first tooth

My first what cried Mrs Merillia in almost terrified amazement

Toothwhen did you cut it

I have no idea Surely Hennessey

Answered dearest grannie cried the Prophet with gathering
agitation Did you ever wear a short coat

IIm not a man

You didnt Always a skirt

Of course Why

And youre sixtyeight on the twentieth So for sixtyeight years
youve always worn a skirt Thats four

Four what Are you

When did you put your hair up grannie darling

My hairnever You know Ive always had a maid to do these things for

Of course Youve never put your hair up I might have known You were
married very young werent you

Ah yes On my seventeenth birthday and was left a widow in exactly
two years time Your poor dear granf

Thank you grannie thank you Seven

Seven what Hennessey One would th

And now dear grannie tell me one thing only one little thing more
Aboutthat is talking of rashes

Rashers

No grannie rashesillnesses you know that take an epidemic form

Well what about them Surely there isnt an epidemic in the square

How many have you had grannie

Where Had what

Here anywhere in the square grannie

Rashes

I Have a rash in the square

Exactly Have you everan epidemic you know

I have an epidemic in Berkeley Square You must be crazy Hennessey

Probably very likely grannie But have you Tell me quickly Have
you

Certainly not As if any gentlewoman

Answered grannie answered Eight

Eight what

Questions Thank you dearest grannie I knew youd tell me I knew you
would

And the Prophet rushed from the room leaving Mrs Merillia in a
condition that cannot be described and that not all the subsequent
ministrations of Mrs Fancy Quinglet were able to alleviate

Having reached the hall the Prophet hastily put on his coat and hat and
called Mr Ferdinand to him

Mr Ferdinand he said assuming a fixed and stony dignity to conceal
his agitation and dismay I am leaving the house at once with thethe
lady and gentleman who are in the library

At this description of the kids Mr Ferdinand was very nearly seized
with convulsions However as he said nothing and merely wrung his large
hands the Prophet after a slight pause continued

I may be away some time so if Mrs Merillia should make any inquiry
you will say that I have left to pay a visit to some friends

Yes sir Shall I tell Gustavus to pack your things

Certainly not

The Prophet was turning towards the library when Mr Ferdinand added

When shall we expect you back sir Am I to forward your letters

No no I shall return in a few hours

Oh I beg pardon sir And if any telegrams

There will not be any I am now going to answer the telegrams in
person

Yes sir

Come along my children cried the Prophet putting his head into the
library

Not your children if you please Mr Vivian replied the little boy
Corona come on

How do we go my dears asked the Prophet with an attempt at gaiety
and endeavouring to ignore the prostrated demeanour of Mr Ferdinand
who was in waiting to open the hall door

By the purple bus as far as the Pork Butchers Rest piped the
little boyat this point Mr Ferdinand could not refrain from a slight
exclamationthen we take the train to the Mouse Mouse Mouse

Mus Mus Mus chanted the little girl

As Mr Ferdinand was unable to open the door paralysis having
apparently supervened the Prophet did so and the cheerful little
party emerged upon the step to find Lady Enid Thistle in the very act of
pressing the electric bell When she beheld the vivacious trio all agog
for their mornings expedition come thus suddenly upon her she cried
out musically

Why where are you off to

The Prophet was much embarrassed by the encounter

I am taking these lithe caught the staring eye of
Capricornusthese friends of mine for a little walk he said

Ill come with you said Lady Enid with an almost Highland decision
Ive got something to say to you and we can talk as we go

She glanced very inquisitively indeed at the two children who had
begun to frisk at sight of the square all bathed in winter sunshine The
Prophet was very much upset

Dont you think he began

It will be delightful to have some exercise she interrupted firmly
Which way are you going

Which way Oh totowards

The Prophet stopped He did not know from what point the purple bus
started to gain the Pork Butchers Rest Capricornus hastened to inform
him

We take the purple bus at the corner of Air Street he piped

The purple bus cried Lady Enid The purple bus

She glanced searchingly at the Prophet

Ah she murmured so you are taking a purple bus to your double
life

He could not deny it They were now all walking forward in the sun and
as the little Corona and Capricornus became speedily intent upon the
wonders of this central district Lady Enid and the Prophet were able to
have a quiet word or two together

I came to tell you she said that Mrs Vane Bridgeman will expect
you tonight at

I am engaged at eleven cried the Prophet in despair at the
imposition of this fresh burden upon his weary shoulders

I know To the Lord Chancellor but

No I have an engagement which I dare not break at home

Really

She gazed at him with her large handsome grey eyes and added

I do believe youre silly enough to live your double life at home
sometimes How splendid

No no I assure you

Of course you do You dear foolish thing Youre ever so much sillier
than I am Youre my master

No indeed no no

But you can go to Mrs Bridgemans for an hour easily She expects you
and Ive promised that you will go

Its very kind of you but really

So thats settled Youll meet me there but dont forget Im Miss
Minerva Partridge The address is Zoological House Regents Park that
big house in a garden just outside the Zoo

The big house in the Zoological Gardens said the Prophet feebly
Thank you very much

No no outside the Zoo And then we can arrange tonight about your
introducing her to Mr Sagittarius

Hush Hush whispered the Prophet

But he was too late The long ears of the little pitchers had caught the
wellknown word

Why thats pater familias piped the little Capricornus

And mater familiaris added the little Corona

You dont mean to say cried Lady Enid to the Prophet that these are
the children of Mr Sagittarius

The Prophet bent his head

How very interesting said Lady Enid Everything is working out most
beautifully I must get them some chocolates

And she immediately stepped into a confectioners and came out with a
beautiful box of bonbons tied with amethyst ribbon which she gave to
the delighted children

I know your dear father she said At least I know who he is

And she looked firmly at the Prophet who dropped his eyes They were
now at the corner of Air Street and the purple bus could be seen
looming brilliantly in the distance

Goodbye Lady Enid said the Prophet

Oh Ill see you off she replied evidently resolved to satisfy some
further unexpressed curiosity

There it is cried Capricornus Its coming There it is

Isnt it pretty shrieked the little Corona who was evidently growing
much excited by the chocolates and the centralness of the whole thing
Lets go on the top Lets go on the top

She began to jump on the pavement and her brother was just about to
follow her example when some sudden idea struck him into gravity He
turned to the Prophet and exclaimed solemnly

Oh if you please Mr Vivian have you got the crab with you

The crab cried Lady Enid with much vivacity

Yes yes my boy its all right said the Prophet hastily

Not your boy if you please Mr Vivian returned the little
inquisitor And have you got the fist tooth

Yes yes

And the rashes and the honoured grandmother and

Ive got everything cried the Prophet every single thing

Because mater familias said I was to make you bring them if I stayed
for them all day

Yes yes theyre all hereevery one

Lady Enid was gazing at the Prophets slim form with almost passionate
curiosity It was evidently a problem to her how he had managed to
conceal so many various commodities about his person without altering
his shape However she had no time to study the matter for at this
moment the purple bus jerked along the kerb and the voice of the
conductor was heard crying

Pork Butchers Rest All the way one penny Porkpennyall the
wayButchersRestonePorkallPorkpennyPorkButchers
PorkRestPorkpenny

With a hasty farewell the Prophet accompanied and indeed closely
clutched by the little Corona and Capricornus scrambled fanatically
and not without two or three heavy falls to the summit of the bus
while Lady Enid read the legend printed on it with a smile ere she
turned to walk home putting two and two together and thinking with
keen feminine satisfaction how useless in the long run are all the
negatives of man

In later years though many memories intervene the Prophet will never
forget his journey to the banks of the Mouse Always it seemed very
strange to him and dreamlike that everlasting journey upon the purple
bus complicated by the chatter of the younger scions of the Malkiel
dynasty and by the shrill cries of the conductor summoning the
passersby to hasten to that place of repose consecrated to the worthy
and hardworking individuals who drew their modest incomes from the pig
The character of the streets changed as the central districts were left
behind and a curious scent the scent of Suburbia seemed to float
between the tall chimneys in the morose atmosphere The purple chariot
which rolled on and on like the chariot of Fate drew gradually away
from the large thoroughfares into mean streets whose air of dull
gentility was for ever autumnal and the Prophet on passing some
gigantic gasworks mechanically wondered whether it might not perhaps
be that monument to whose shadow Malkiel the First had lived and died
Once looking up at the black sky he remarked to the little Capricornus
that it was evidently going to rain

No Mr Vivian replied the boy It wont rain hard this week
Januarys a fine month but therell be heavy floods in March
especially along the banks of the Thames

And in February therell be such a lot of scarlet fever in the southern
portions of England added the little Corona Oh Corney just look at
that kitty on the airey railings

Area Corona corrected her brother Oh my aint it funny

The Prophet remembered that he was travelling with the scions of a
prophetic house

It seemed many years before the bus stopped before a brick building
full of quart pots situated upon a gentle eminence sloping to a
coalyard and the voice of the conductor proclaimed that the place of
repose was reached The Prophet and his diminutive guides descended from
the roof and were shortly in a train puffing between the hunched backs
of abominable little houses sooty as street cats and alive with crying
babies Then bits of waste land appeared bald wildernesses in which
fragments of broken crockery hibernated with old tin cans and kettles
yellow as dying leaves A furtive brown rivulet wandered here and
there like a thing endeavouring to conceal itself and unable to find a
hidingplace

Thats the Mouse Mr Vivian remarked Capricornus proudly We shall
soon be there

Ridiculum mus rejoined his sister who evidently took after her
learned mother

Culus Corona and youre not to say that Pater familias says that the
Mouse is a noble stream We get out here Mr Vivian

Here proved to be a wayside station on the very bank of the noble
stream and on the edge of a piece of waste ground so large that it
might almost have been called country

The Prophet and the two kids set off across this earth which was
named by the inhabitants the Common In the distance rose a fringe of
detached brick and stone villas towards which Capricornus now pointed a
forefinger that trembled with pride

Thats where we live he said in a voice that was grown squeaky from
conceit

Dulce domus piped his sister clutching the skirt of the Prophets
coat and thus supported performing several very elaborate dancing
steps upon the clayey soil over which he was feebly staggering Dulce
dulce dulce domus Look at that rat Corney

A large raking rodent indeed at that instant emerged from the
wreckage of what had once been a copper cauldron near by and walked
slowly away towards a slope of dust garnished with broken bottles and
abandoned cabbage stalks The Prophet shuddered and longed to flee but
the two kids as if divining his thought now clasped his hands and led
him firmly forward to a yellow villa fringed with white Bath stone
and garnished plentifully with griffins From its flat front shot
ostentatiously forth a porch adorned with Roman columns which commanded
a near view of the Mouse and before the porch was a small garden in
which several healthylooking nettles had made their home

As the Prophet and the two kids approached this delightful abode a
white face appeared gluing itself to the pane of an upper window

Theres pater familias piped Capricornus Dont he look ill

As they mounted the flight of imitation marble steps the face
disappeared abruptly

Hes coming to let us in said Capricornus Youre sure youve
brought the crab and all the rashes

Quite sure

Because if you havent I dont know whatever mater familiasll

At this moment the portal of the lodge was furtively opened about
half an inch and a very small segment of ashencoloured human face
containing a large and apprehensive eye was shown in the aperture

Are you alone said the hollow voice of Mr Sagittarius

Quite quite alone said the Prophet reassuringly

Its all right pater familias cried Capricornus Hes brought all
the rashes and the first tooth and everything I made him

I dont think he wanted to added the little Corona suddenly
developing malice

Ive taken this long journey Mr Sagittarius said the Prophet
with a remnant of selfrespect at your special request Am I to be
permitted to come in

If youre sure youre quite alone returned the sage showing a
slightly enlarged segment of face

I am quite surepositive

At this the door was opened just sufficiently to admit the passage of
one thin person at a time and in single file the Prophet Corona and
Capricornus passed into the lodge



CHAPTER XV

THE PROPHET CREATES A DIVERSION AT HIS OWN EXPENSE

On stepping into a small vestibule paved with black and white lozenges
and fitted up with an iron umbrella stand a Moorish lamp and a large
yellow china pug dog the Prophet found himself at once faced by Mr
Sagittarius whose pallid countenance nervous eye and suspicious
demeanour plainly proclaimed him to be as he had stated very rightly
and properly going about in fear of his life

Go to the schoolroom my darlings he whispered to his children Why
what have you there

Choclets said Capricornus

From the pretty lady mulius pulchrum added the little Corona

Who is a mulibus pulchrum my love asked Mr Sagittarius before
Capricornus had time to correct his sisters Latin

It was Miss Minerva said the Prophet We happened to meet her

Indeed sir Run away my pretties and dont eat more than one each
or mater familias will not approve

Then as the little ones disappeared into the shadows of the region
above he added to the Prophet

Youve nearly been the death of Madame sir

Im sure Im very sorry said the Prophet

Sorrow is no salve sir no salve at all Were it not for her books I
fear we might have lost her

Good gracious

Mercifully her books have comforted her She is resting among them now
Madame is possessed of a magnificent library sir encyclopaedic in its
scope and cosmopolitan in its point of view In it are represented every
age and every race since the dawn of letters thousands upon thousands
of authors sir Rabelais and Dean Farrar Lamb and the Hindoos
Mettlelink and the pith of the great philosophers such as John Oliver
Hobbes Locke Hume and Earl Spencer the biting sarcasm of Hiny the
pathos of Peps the oratorical masterstrokes of such men as Gladstone
Demosthenes and Keir Hardie the romance of Kipling sir of Bret Harte
and Danty Rossini the poetry of Kempis a Browning and of Elizabeth
Thomas Barrettall all are there bound in Persian calf Among these
she seeks for solace To these she flies in hours of anguish

Does she indeed said the Prophet feeling thoroughly overwhelmed

She desires me to take you to her at once sir there to confer
andhe lowered his voice and trembled visiblyto arrange measures
for the protection of my life

The Prophet found himself wishing that he had been less precipitate in
covertly alluding to Sir Tiglaths long desire of assault and battery
but before he had time to wish anything for more than half a minute Mr
Sagittarius had guided him ceremoniously across the hall and was turning
the handle of a door that was decorated with black and scarlet paint

Here sir he whispered you will find Madame surrounded by the
authors whom she loves by their portraits their biographies and their
writings Here she communes with the great philosophers sir the poets
the historians and the humourists of the entire world from the earliest
days down to this very momentin Persian calf sir

He gazed awfully at the Prophet and gently opened the door of this
temple of the intellect

The Prophet expected to find himself ushered into a gigantic chamber
lined from floor to ceiling with shelves that groaned beneath their
burden of the literature of genius Indeed he had in fancy beheld even
the chairs and couches covered with stacks of volumes the very floor
littered with the choicest productions of the brains of the dead and
living His surprise was therefore very great when on passing through
the door he beheld Madame Sagittarius reposing at full length upon
a maroon sofa in a small apartment whose bare walls were entirely
innocent of bookshelves Indeed the only thing of the sort which was
visible was a dwarf revolving bookcase which stood beside the sofa and
contained some twenty volumes bound as Mr Sagittarius had stated in
Persian calf each of these volumes being numbered and adorned with a
label on which was printed in letters of gold The Library of Famous
Literature Edited by Dr Carter Tasty Titbits from all Times

Madame sir in her library whispered Mr Sagittarius by the door
She is absorbed sir and does not notice us

In truth Madame Sagittarius did appear to be absorbed in thought or
something else for her eyes were closed her mouth was open and a
sound of regular breathing filled the little room

She is thinking out some problem sir continued Mr Sagittarius
She is communing with the mighty dead Sophronia my love Sophronia
Capricornus has brought the gentleman according to your orders Sophy
Sophy

His final utterances which were somewhat strident caused Madame
Sagittarius to come away from her communion with the mighty dead with
a loud ejaculation of the nature of a snort combined with a hissing
whistle to kick up her indoor kid boots into the air turn upon her
right elbow and present a countenance marked with patches of red and
white and a pair of goggling and yet hazy eyes to the intruders upon
her intellectual exertions

Mr Vivian has come Sophronia according to your directions

Madame uttered a second snort brought her feet to the floor arranged
her face in a dignified expression with one fair hand breathed heavily
and finally bowed to the Prophet with majestic reserve and remarked
with the professional click

I was immersed in thought and did not perceive your entrance _Mens
invictus manetur_ Be seated I beg

Here certain very elaborate contortions and swellings of her interesting
countenance suggested that she was repressing a goodsized yawn and she
was obliged to rearrange her features with both hands before she could
continue

Thought conquers matter as PlautoI should say as Platus very rightly
obesrved

Quite so assented the Prophet trying to live up to the library but
scarcely succeeding

Even in the days of the great Juvenile proceeded Madame to whose
satires I owe muchhere she laid a loving hand upon Vol 2 of the
Library of Famous LiteratureLong ere the days when Lord Lytton and
his Caxtons introduced us to the blessings of the printing press there
were doubtless ladies who like myself could forget the treachery and
the lies of men in silent communion with the brains of the departed Far
better to be Miltons Il Penserosero than Lord Byrons LAllegra

To this pronounciamento which was interrupted several times by more
alarming contortions of the brainworkers face the Prophet replied
with a vague affirmative while Mr Sagittarius whispered

Her whole knowledge sir comes straight from therepointing towards
the dwarf bookcase She brought it on the instalment system Dr Carter
has made her what she is That man sir deserves to be canonised Eight
guineas and a half sir and such a result

Such a result the Prophet whispered back

By this time Madame Sagittarius had apparently ceased to commune with
the dead for her striking face assumed a more normal expression
of feminine bitterness as she realised who was before her and she
exclaimed sharply

Oh so youve come at last Mr Vivian And pray what have you to
say What about the rashes And what is this danger that threatens Mr
Sagittarius

Wed better take the danger first my dear said Mr Sagittarius with
grave anxiety

Very well Not that it should be the most important to one who wears
the _toga virilibus_

True my love Still to take it first will clear the ground I think
and set me more at ease Well sir

Thus adjured the Prophet resolved to make a clean breast of Sir
Tiglaths declarations and he therefore replied

I thought it only right to wire to you as I did having learnt
that there is in London a gentleman an eminent man who has for
fiveandforty years been seeking for Malkiel with the avowed intention
ofof

Oh what sir of what said Mr Sagittarius with trembling lips

Of doing him violence replied the Prophet impressively

What is the gents name said Mr Sagittarius in great agitation

His name _Nomen volens_ added Madame

That said the Prophet I prefer not to say at present

But why should he desire to

Because you are a prophet

There Jupiter cried Madame with flushed spitefulness What have
I always said All prophets are what they call outsiders_hors
doeuvres_ neither more nor less

I know my love I know But how should this gent recognise me for a
prophet Im sure my dress my manner are those of an outside broker
as I have often told you Sophy How

The gentleman has not yet recognised you said the Prophet At the
moment he believes you to be an American syndicate

Thank mercy ejaculated Mr Sagittarius

But one can never tell added the Prophet He might find out

Nonsense cried Madame at this juncture We might quite well have
gone to the square yesterday as I always suspected But you are so
timid Jupiter _Timeo DanDan_well _Dan_ something or other as
Virgil so truly says

Cautious Sophronia only cautious for your and the childrens sakes

I call a man whos afraid even when hes passing everywhere as an
American syndicate a cowardly custard rejoined Madame who appeared to
be suffering under that peculiar form of flushed irritability which is
apt to follow on heavy thought indulged in to excess in a recumbent
position during the daytime There thats settled So now let us get
to business Kindly hand me your prophecy of last night Mr Vivian

The Prophet drew from a breast pocket a sheet or two of notepaper on
which he had dotted down in prophetic form the events of the night
before Madame received it and continued

Before perusing this report Mr Vivian I should wish to be made
acquainted with those particulars

Which ones said the Prophet

Of your grandmothers career

Oh I

Let us take them in order please and proceed _parri passo_ When was
the old lady removed from the bottle

Never replied the Prophet firmly Never

An expression of incredulous amazement decorated the obstreperous
features of Madame

Do you mean to tell me Mr Vivian that she sucks it still she
inquired

I mean what I say that she has never been removed from it returned
the Prophet with energy

Well sir she must be very partial to milk and Indian rubber very
partial indeed said Mr Sagittarius Go on my darling

Her first tooth Mr Vivianwhen did she cut it

She has no idea

Madame began to look decidedly grim

Date of shortcoating she rapped out

There was no date She never wore a shortcoat

Do you desire me to believe Mr Vivian that the old lady has been
going about in long clothes ever since she was born inquired Madame
with incredulous sarcasm

Most certainly I do replied the Prophet

Then how does she get along pray Come Come

She has always worn long clothes cried the Prophet boldly standing
up for his beloved relative and always will You can take that from
me Madame Sagittarius I know my grandmother and I am ready to pledge
my honour to it

Oh very well She must be a very remarkable lady Thats all I can
say When did she put her hair up

Never She has never put it up

She has never put her hair up

No never

You mean to say that your grandmother goes about in long clothes
with her hair down in the central districts cried Madame in blank
amazement

She has never put her hair up answered the Prophet with almost
obstinate determination

Oh wellif she prefers But I wonder what the police are about
retorted Madame And now the rashes

There are none

But at this Madames temperalready somewhat upset by her prolonged
communion with the mighty deadshowed symptoms of giving way
altogether

Rubbish Mr Vivian she said clicking loudly and passing with an
almost upheaving jerk to her upper register Im a mother and was once
a child Rubbish I must insist upon knowing the number of the rashes

I assure you there are none

Dyou wish me to believe that the old lady has gone about all her life
in the Berkeley Square in long clothes and her hair down with her lips
to the bottle and never had a rash Do you wish me to believe that Mr
Vivian

Yes sir do you wish Madame a lady of deep education sir to believe
that cried Mr Sagittarius

I can only adhere to what I have said answered the Prophet My
grandmother has never been removed from the bottle has never worn a
short coat has never put her hair up and has never had an epidemic in
Berkeley Square

Then all I can say is that shes an unnatural old lady cried Madame
with obvious temper tossing her head and kicking out the kid boots as
if seized with the sudden desire to use them upon a human football And
theres not many like her

There is no one like her no one at all said the Prophet with
fervour

So I should suppose cried Madame forgetting the other questions as
to the day of marriage etc in the vexation of the moment She must
certainly be the bird of whom Phoenix wrote that rose from ashes in the
days of the classics _Rarum avis_ indeed Eh Jupiter

Very rarum my dear very indeed responded her husband with
imitative sarcasm An avis indeed not a doubt of it

De Queechy should have known her continued Madame He always loved
everything out of the common Well and now for the prophecy What is
all this Mr Vivian

The result of last nights observation said the Prophet

Do you call that a cycloidal curve asked Madame with a contralto
laugh that shook the library Look Jupiter

Mr Sagittarius glanced over his wifes heaving shoulder

Very poor my dear very irregular indeed

Its the best I could do said the Prophet still politely

I daresay replied Mr Sagittarius I daresay Wheres your
starmap

Im afraid I dont know answered the Prophet I left it in the
pomade

The pomade

Yes the butlers own special pomade and it seems to have
disappeared

Very careless very careless indeed Lets seeprophecy first then

at night in immediate future Great turmoil in the house during dark
hours Hm Some stranger or strangers coming into her life and
causing great trouble and confusion almost resulting in despair and
perhaps actually inducing illness Hm Hm We didnt arrive at any of

The Crab

Of course she was drawn to it She depends on the Crab these nights
But what does the rest mean

The Crab was dressed

Dressedwhat in

I dont know said the Prophet It didnt tell me

Mr Sagittarius and Madame exchanged glances

Explain yourself Mr Vivian I beg cried Madame in a somewhat
excited manner How could the Crab be dressed

I have wondered said the Prophet gazing at the couple before him
with shining eyes But it was dressed last night and that made it
exceptionally dangerous in some way Something seemed to tell me so
Something did tell me so

What told you inquired Madame with more excitement and a certain
respect which had been quite absent from her manner before

Something that came in the night I dont know what it was Light
flashed from it

It sounds like a sort of comet my darling said Mr Sagittarius
considerably perturbed We didnt observe that the Crab was specially
dressed did we

It had nothing on at all when we saw it said Madame with growing
agitation But whatever was this comet that flashed light Thats what
I want to get at

It was a dark thing that told me the Crab was dressed that my
grandmother had been with it and that its influence was inimical to
her

A dark thing Thats not a comet said Mr Sagittarius

It vanished with a flash of light into the square

At what time did you observe it sir asked Mr Sagittarius while
Madame leaned forward gazing with goggling eyes at the Prophet

At exactly halfpast one

Did it stay long

A few minutes onlybut it made an impression upon me that I can never
forget

It had apparently also made a very great impression upon Mr and Madame
Sagittarius who remained for some seconds staring fixedly at the
Prophet without uttering a word At last Mr Sagittarius turned to
Madame and said in a voice that shook with seriousness

Can it be Sophronia that prophets ought to live in the central
districts Can it really be that the nearer they are to the Circus and
even to the Stores

_O beatus illa_ interjected Madame upon the pinions of a sigh

Yes Sophronia the Stores the more clearly is the knowledge of the
future vouchsafed to them If it should prove to be so

Madame stared again upon the Prophet with a fixity and strained inquiry
which made him shift in his seat

If it should she repeated upon the lowest note of her lower
register which sounded at that solemn moment like the keynote of a
dreamer Then with a sudden change of manner she cried sharply

Jupiter you must accompany this gentleman back to the square today

The Prophet started So did Mr Sagittarius

But they cried simultaneously

And you must share his night watch

But my darling

Or I will cried Madame Which is it to be

Mr Sagittarius exclaimed the Prophet

Very well said Madame Let mine be the weary task to wait and
watch at home _Fata feminus_ The mystery of the dressed Crab must be
unveiled Should this mysterious visitant again vouchsafe a prophetic
message a practical prophet must be at hand to receive it Jupiter
this gentleman is not practical This reportshe struck the paper
on which the Prophet had dotted down his notesis badly written
The cycloidal curve might have been made by a Board School child The
deductions drawn_deductio ad absurdibus_reveal no talent none of
the prophetic _feu de joie_ at all But this mystery of the dressed Crab
may mean much Jupiter you will accompany this gentleman back to London
and you will assist him practically at the telescope tonight

Very well my love I will risk the personal danger for your and the
childrens

Butbut really began the Prophet I am very sorry but

Madame has spoken sir said Mr Sagittarius very solemnly

I know she has Butyes I know there are no buts in your dictionary
Madame I know there arentbut I have an engagement tonight that I
have sworn

What engagement sir said Mr Sagittarius sternly You have sworn
to us You must know that

I have sworn to almost everyone cried the distracted Prophet But
this swearI mean this oath must be kept before yours

Before ours sir

It comes on before eleven I keep my oath to you after it I manage the
two dont you see

He will see that you manage the two Mr Vivian I can assure you
said Madame viciously Wont you Jupiter

Certainly my dear What is the oath sir that you place before ours

An oath to Miss Minerva returned the Prophet beginning to feel
reckless firm in the conviction that it was henceforth his destiny to
be the very sport of Fate

Ha cried Mr Sagittarius The double life

Who is Miss Minerva pray said Madame shooting a very penetrating
glance upon her husband

Your husband can tell you that replied the Prophet by no means
without guile

Jupiter cried Madame what is the meaning of this Who is this
person

Mr Sagittarius looked exceedingly uncomfortable

My dear he began she is a young fethat is a young woI should
say

A fe A wo Explain yourself Jupiter

She is a lady my love

A lady Do I know her

I believe not my dear

And do you

No my darling That isthat is

Yes I suppose said Madame with a very violent click

I can hardly say Sophronia that I cant indeed I have met her by
accident quite by accident I assure you once or twice

Where

At Jellybrands She goes there to fetch letters on the same day as I
do

Madames very intellectual brow was overclouded with storm She turned
upon the Prophet

And what of this person Mr Vivian she cried What of her and this
oath

The Prophet who was secretly very delighted with the diversion he had
so cleverly created hastened to reply

I have promised most solemnly to meet her tonight at a house in the
Zoological Gardens

A house in the Zoological Gardens

I mean at the Zoological House the residence of Mrs Vane Bridgeman
who is

But at this point in his explanation the Prophet was interrupted by
both his hearers

The Jellybrand one cried Mr Sagittarius

The prophets patron vociferated Madame



CHAPTER XVI

THE PROPHET RETURNS FROM THE MOUSE WITH TWO OLD AND VALUED FRIENDS

At these exclamations the Prophet started in some surprise

You know this lady he asked

By repute sir replied Mr Sagittarius

Who does not cried Madame She built the Prophets Rest at
Birchington

And the Mediums Almshouses at Sunnington

And the Palmists Retreat at Millaby Bay

And the

I see you know all about her interposed the Prophet Well she is
giving a reception tonight at Zoological House and I have sworn to be
there But I shall get home by eleven You will understand however
that I cannot have the pleasure of entertaining Mr Sagittarius during
the evening under my own roof I regret this extremely but you see it
is unavoidable

To the Prophets great surprise this lucid explanation was received by
his hearers with a strange silence and a combined meditative and
even moony staring which was to him inexplicable Both Madame and Mr
Sagittarius seemed suddenly immersed in contemplation They began he
thought to look like Buddhists or like those devoted persons who
in the times of the desert monks remained for long periods posed upon
pillows in sandy wastes musing upon Eternity At first as he met their
fixed eyes he fancied that they were perhaps falling into a trance
but presently the conviction seized him that they must be on the
contrary busily thinking out some problem He hoped fervently that he
did not form part of it At length the quivering silence was broken by
Mr Sagittarius

I might accompany you to Mrs Bridgemans sir he said to the
Prophet Might I not Sophronia

Oh but began the Prophet very hastily

The lady has frequently pressed me to accept of her hospitality

Indeed

For years she has been writing to me at Jellybrands under my real
name of Malkiel the Second you understand She addresses me simply as
the master

But do the postal authorities

Not upon the envelope sir not upon the envelope

I see

Hitherto true to myself true to the principles of Malkiel the
First and to the instincts of Madame I have declined her personal
acquaintance But there is no reason why you should not introduce me to
the house as Mr Sagittarius no reason at all

The Prophet knew only too well that there was not but before he had
time to go on trying to wriggle out of the complication Madame struck
in

Miss Minerva is to be present at this reception I believe she said
sharply

Yes she is answered the Prophet illumined by a ray of hope

Jupiter said Madame I will accompany you and Mr Vivian to the
Zoological Gardens tonight It is my sacred duty

The Prophet groaned

But my darling

The reception over I will assist you and Mr Vivian at the telescope
in the Berkeley Square In your presence I can do so without departing
from my principles _salvo pudoribus_ Do not interrupt me Jupiter if
you please I have thought the matter out The crisis in our fate is at
hand Upon the events of the next three nights depends our future These
mysterious messages of which Mr Vivian speaks must be examined into by
us upon the spot This mystery of the dressed Crab must be made clear
A womans intellect is needed A womans intellect shall not be wanting
Ill as I am worn down by the occurrences of yesterday and by this
gentlemans incessant telegrams I will leave my bookshere she waved
one hand towards the dwarf bookcaseI will assume an appropriate
_neglige_ and my outdoor boots a fichu and bonnet and will accompany
you at once to the Berkeley Square there to confer and arrange the
programme of the evening Mrs Bridgeman would fall down before us in
worship could she know who we really are As it is Mr Vivian will
introduce us modestly as two old and valued friends The time may be at
hand when we need no longer hide ourselves beneath an _alibi_ Till then
we must possess ourselves and Mr Vivian must possess us in patience
Ill as I am I will accompany you Tonight shall see me in the
Zoological Gardens at my husbands side

Before the prospect of this sublime selfsacrifice both Mr Sagittarius
and the Prophet were as men dumb They said not a word They only
gazedwith a sort of strange idiotcyat Madame as she rose with an
elaborate and studied feebleness from the maroon couch and prepared to
go upstairs to assume the appropriate _neglige_ Only when she was at
her full height did the Prophet rendered desperate by the terrible
results of his own ingenuity nerve himself to utter one last protest

I really do not think it would be quite according to the rules of
etiquette which prevail in the central districts he cried for a lady
to spend the night in the butlers pantry of a comparative stranger
even when accompanied by her husband It might give rise to talk in the
square and

The butlers pantry sir exclaimed Mr Sagittarius Explain
yourself I beg

The telescope is there and

I have passed beyond the reach of etiquette said Madame looking
considerably like Joan of Arc and other wellknown heroines My
duty lies plain before me Of myself I should not have selected the
Zoological Gardens and the butlers pantry of a comparative stranger as
places in which to pass the night even when accompanied by my husband
But my conscience_mens conscium recto_guides me and I will not
resist it I will assume my _neglige_ and bonnet and will be with you in
a moment

So saying she majestically quitted the apartment

The Prophet fell down upon the maroon sofa like a man smitten with
paralysis He felt suddenly old and very weak He tried to think to
consider how he could explain Madame Sagittarius to his grandmotherfor
she must surely now become aware of the presence of strangers in her
pretty homehow he could arrange matters with Mr Ferdinand how he
could apologise to a lady whom he had never yet seen for appearing
at her house with two uninvited guests how he could get rid of the
Sagittariuses when the horrible night watch should be at an end and the
frigid winter dawn be near But his mind refused to work His brain was
a blank containing nothing except perhaps a vague desire for
sudden death Mr Sagittarius did not disturb his contemplation of
the inevitable Indeed that gentleman also seemed meditative and the
silence lasted until the reappearance of Madame in a brown robeof a
slightly teagown typetrimmed with green chiffon and coffeecoloured
lace a black bonnet adorned with about a score of imitation plums
made in some highlyglazed material a heavy cloak lined with priceless
rabbitskins and the outdoor boots

If the Prophet had found the journey to the Mouse a painful experience
what can be said of his feelings during the journey from that noble
stream Long afterwards he recalled his state of mind during the
tramp across the Common among the broken crockery the dustheaps the
decaying vegetables and the occasional lurking rats the journey in the
train the reembarkment upon the purple bus from the gentle eminence
sloping towards the coalyard the long pilgrimage towards the central
districts with his very outlying companions He recalled the peculiar
numbness that strove against the desperation of his thoughts his feeble
efforts to lay plans frustrated by a perpetual buzzing in his brain his
flitting visions of that gentle grandmother round whose venerable age
and dignity he was about to group such peculiar personalities and
beneath whose roof he was about to indulge in such unholy prophetic
practices Long afterwardsbut even then he could not smile as men so
often smile when they look back on lost despairs

He and his companions spoke but little together as they journeyed
Occasionally Madame and Mr Sagittarius conversed in husky whispers
like brigands the Prophet thought and the veiled click of Madames
contralto struck through the startled air But mostly a silence
prevaileda silence alive with fate

At the corner of Air Street they got out and began to walk down
Piccadilly towards the Berkeley square It was now evening The lamps
were lighted and the murmur of strolling crowds filled the gloomy air
Madame stared feverishly about her excited by the press the flashing
hansoms and the gailyilluminated shops Once as she passed Benoists
she murmured _O festum dies_ and again by the Berkeley when she
was momentarily jostled by a very large and umbrageous tramp who
had apparently been celebrating the joys of beggary_Acto profanus
vulgam_ But generally she was silent enwrapped no doubt in bookish
thought When at length they stood before the door of number one
thousand she breathed a heavy sigh

Please said the Prophet in a trembling voice please enter quietly
My grandmother is very unwell

Ankles seems to be a very painful complaint sir said Mr
Sagittarius But Madame and self are not in the habit of creating
uproar by our movements

No no Of course not Stillon tiptoe if you dont mind

I cannot walk on tiptoe said Madame in a voice that sounded to
the Prophet terrifically powerful The attitude is precarious and
undignified As the great Juvenile

Yes yes Ah thats it

He managed to get his key into the door and very gingerly opened it
Madame and Mr Sagittarius stepped into the hall followed closely
by the Prophet who was content on conveying them unobserved to the
library

This way he whispered This way Softly Softly

He began to steal like a shadow across the hall and impressed by his
surreptitious manner his old and valued friends instinctively followed
his example All three of them then with long steps and theatrical
pauses were stagily upon the move when suddenly the door that led to
the servants quarters swung open and Mrs Fancy Quinglet debouched into
their midst succeeded by Mr Ferdinand who carried in his hand a menu
card in a silver holder At the moment of their appearance the Prophet
holding his finger to his lips was taking a soft and secret stride in
the direction of the library door his body bent forward and his head
protruded towards the sanctum he longed to gain and Madame and Mr
Sagittarius true to the instinct of imitation that dwells in our monkey
race were in precisely similar attitudes behind him The hall being
rather dark and the gait of the trio it contained thus tragically
surreptitious it was perhaps not unnatural that Mrs Fancy should give
vent to a piercing cry of terror and that Mr Ferdinand should drop the
menu and crouch back against the wall in a hunched position expressive
of alarm At any rate such were their actions whilefor their
partthe Prophet and his two old and valued friends uttered a united
exclamation and struck three attitudes that were pregnant with defensive
amazement

Having uttered herself Mrs Fancy according to her invariable custom
when completely terrified displayed all the semblance of clearsighted
composure and explanatory discrimination While Mr Ferdinand remained
by the wall with his face to it and his large white hands spread
out upon his shut eyes the ladys maid advanced upon Madame and
addressing herself apparently to some hidden universe in need of
information remarked in rather a piecing voice

I say again as I said afore the house has been broke into and the
robbers are upon us I cant speak different nor mean other

On hearing these words Madames large and rippling countenance became
suffused with indignant scarlet and a preliminary click rang through
the hall The Prophet bounded forward

Hush Fancy he cried What are you saying

What I mean Master Hennessey The house has been broke

Hush Hush This lady and gentleman are

Two old and valued friends boomed Madame

Two old and valued friends of mine Mr Ferdinand Mr Ferdinand take
your face from the wall if you please There is no cause for alarm
Now Fancynow

For Mrs Fancy had as usual broken into tears on learning the
reassuring truth and was now displaying every symptom of distress and
enervation The Prophet unable to calm her was obliged to assist her
upstairs and place her upon the landing where he hurriedly left her
uttering broken moans and murmurs and repeating again and again her
statement of affairs and assertion of inability to conceal the revealed
obvious On his return he found Madame Mr Sagittarius and Mr
Ferdinand grouped statuesquely in the hall as if to represent
Perturbation

Mr Ferdinand he said rather severely I did not expect this conduct
of you shrinking from guests in this extraordinary manner A butler who
shows terror at the sight of visitors does not conduce to the popularity
of his employers

I beg pardon sir I was not prepared

Please be prepared another time You will serve dinner for three
tonight very quietly in the inner diningroom I do not wish Mrs
Merillia to be disturbed in her illness and

If you please sir Mrs Merillia feels herself so much better that she
is coming down to dinner tonight

Coming down to dinner said the Prophet aghast

Yes sir And she has asked in Sir Tiglath Butt and the Lady Julia
Postlethwaite to join her I was about to show Mrs Merillia the menu
sir when

Good Heavens Merciful Powers ejaculated the Prophet

Sir

What on earth is to be done continued the Prophet lost for the
moment to all sense of propriety

Mr Ferdinand looked at the old and valued friends

I cant say sir Im sure he replied pursing up his lips

What is the meaning began Mr Sagittarius

Im not aware that started Madame

The Prophet darted to the library door and opened it

Pray pray come in here he hissed My grandmother Softly

But the old la

Hush please

I must remark Mr Viv

Tsh Tsh Mr Ferdinand wait in the hall I shall want to speak to you
in a moment

Yes sir

The Prophet closed the door and turned to this indignant visitors

This is terrible he said Terrible

Pray why cried Madame

Why cried the Prophet why

He sought frantically for some excuse Suddenly a bright idea occurred
to him

Why he said impressively Because Sir Tiglath Butt the gentleman
who is coming to dinner is the person who for fiveandforty years
has been seeking Mr Sagittarius with the firm intention of assaulting
perhaps of killing him

Mr Sagittarius turned deathly pale and made a movement as if to get
out of the nearest window

This is a trap he stammered This is a rattrap This was planned

Reallybegan the Prophet

But Mr Sagittarius did not heed the exclamation Trembling very
violently he continued

Sophy my darling you are in danger Let us fly

And clutching his wife by the arm to the Prophets unspeakable delight
he endeavoured to lead or rather to drag her to the door But Madame
now showed the metal she was made of

Jupiter she exclaimed in her deepest note if you are a Prophet you
can surely at moments be also a man Where is your _toga virilibus_

I dont know my love Im sure Dont let us lose a moment Come my
angel

I shall not come retorted Madame whose leaping ambition had been
fired by the sound of titled names The gentleman believes you to be an
American syndicate

I know my blessing I know But

Very well If you dont behave like one he will never suspect you

The Prophet saw his chance slipping from him and hastened to interpose

He might divine the truth he said One can never

But at this moment he was interrupted by Mr Ferdinand who abruptly
opened the door and observed

If you please sir Mrs Merillia has sent down orders that the police
are to be fetched at once

Mr Sagittarius now thoroughly unnerved turned from white to grey

The police he vociferated Sophy my angel let us fly This is no
place for you

The police cried the Prophet Why

I believe its Mrs Fancys doing sir If you would go to Mrs
Merillia sir I think

The Prophet rushed from the room and hastened upstairs four steps at a
time He found his beloved grandmother in a state of grave agitation
and Mrs Fancy in floods of tears reiterating her statement that there
were robbers in the house

Oh Hennessey cried Mrs Merillia on his entrance thank God
that you are come There are burglars in the house Fancy has just
encountered them in the hall Go for the police my dearest boy Dont
lose a moment

My dear grannie theyre not burglars

I cant speak different Master Hennessey nor

Then who are they Hennessey Fancy declares

They are twotwowell two old and valued friends of mine

Old and valued friends of ours

Of mine grannie Fancy pray dont make such a noise

Fancy said Mrs Merillia you can go to your room and lie down

Yes maam I say again as I said afore the house has been broke into
and the robbers

At this point the Prophet shut the door on the faithful and persistent
creature who forthwith carried her determination and sobs to an upper
storey

Hennessey what is all this Who is really here

Grannie dear only two friends of mine replied the Prophet trying
to look at ease and feeling like a criminal

Friends of yours But surely then I know them I thought I knew all
your friends

So you do grannie all exceptexcept just these

And they are old and valued you say

No nothat is I mean yes

Mrs Merillia was too dignified to ask any further questions She lay
back on her sofa and looked at her grandson with a shining of mild
reproach in her green eyes

Well my dear she said go back to your friends but dont forget
that Lady Julia and Sir Tiglath are dining here at halfpast seven

Grannie cried the Prophet with a desperate feeling that Madame meant
to stay you ought not to dine downstairs tonight Let me send and put
them off

No Hennessey she answered with gentle decision I feel better and
I want cheering up My morning was not altogether pleasant

The Prophet understood that she was alluding to his questions and felt
cut to the heart His home seemed crumbling about him but he knew not
what to do or what to say Mrs Merillia observed his agitation but she
did not choose to remark upon it for she considered curiosity the most
vulgar of all the vices

Go to your friends dear she said again But be in time for dinner

Yes grannie

The Prophet descended the stairs and met Mr Ferdinand at the bottom

Am I to send for the police sir

No no Ive explained matters

And about dinner sir

Ill tell you in a moment Mr Ferdinand replied the Prophet
entering the library with the fixed intention of getting Madame and Mr
Sagittarius out of the house without further delay

The tableau that met his eyes however was not reassuring He found
Madame having laid aside her bonnet and thrown the rabbitskin cloak
carelessly upon a settee arranging her hair before a mirror and
shaking up the coffeecoloured lace fichu in a manner that suggested
a permanent occupation of the house while her husband sunk in a deep
armchair in an attitude of complete nervous prostration was gazing
dejectedly into the fire When the Prophet entered the latter bounded
with alarm while Madame turned round a couple of hairpins in her mouth
and both hands to the back of her head

Ah she remarked through the pins _il a vous_ I am happy to say
that I have induced Mr Sagittarius to assume his _toga virilibus_ and
that we have therefore great pleasure in yielding to your thoughtful
pressure

My what said the Prophet blankly

You thoughtful pressure and accepting your urgent invite to dine here
before proceeding to the Zoological Gardens and thence to the butlers
pantry

The Prophet tried not to groan while she emitted a pin and secured with
it a wandering plait of raven hair

Youre sure sir said Mr Sagittarius in a deplorable voice that
the gentleman is convinced that I am really an American syndicate

The Prophet rang the bell He could not trust himself to speak and
when he looked at Madames large and determined eyes he knew that to do
so would be useless

Mr Ferdinand appeared

Mr Ferdinand said the Prophet this lady and gentleman will join us
at dinner tonight

Yes sir said Mr Ferdinand casting a glance of outraged prudery
upon Mr Sagittarius who was attired in his usual morning costume
including spats

Whats the matter Mr Ferdinand asked the Prophet following that
functionarys eyes Ha Hes not dressed

No sir

Mr Sagittarius cried the Prophet youre not dressed

Sir cried that gentleman do you dare to accuse me of impropriety in
a frock coat

No no But for dinner You cant possibly dine like that

I have dined like this sir for the last twenty years The architects
and their wives

I daresay But unluckily there will be no architects and their wives at
dinner tonight Please stand up

Sir

Kindly stand up Mr Ferdinand

Yes sir

Place your back against this gentlemans if you pleasetouching
touching Dont wriggle away like that Keep your heels to the ground
while I fetch a sheet of notepaper Dont move your heads either of you
I thought so Youre pretty much the same height Mr Ferdinand you
will lay out a white shirt and one of your black dress suits in my
dressingroom at once Madame I regret that we must leave you for a few
moments Will you rest here Allow me to place a cushion for your head
And here is Juvenal in the original

So saying the Prophet hurried Mr Sagittarius from the room driving
Mr Ferdinand in a condition of elephantine horror before him and
abandoning Madame to an acquaintance with the classics that she had
certainly never achieved in the society of the renowned Dr Carter



CHAPTER XVII

MALKIEL THE SECOND IS MISTAKEN FOR A RATCATCHER

If you tremble like that of course it must look too big exclaimed
the Prophet to Mr Sagittarius a quarter of an hour later Draw it in
at the back

Mr Sagittarius with shaking hands drew in the waistcoat of Mr
Ferdinand which hung in folds around his thin and agitated figure

Thats better said the Prophet They wont notice anything odd But
youve turned up yourMr Ferdinands trousers

Theyre too long sir You braced them too low for

I braced them low on purpose cried the Prophet in great excitement
to cover the spats since you cant get on Mr Ferdinands boots
Kindly turn them down

As to the spats sir the architects and their wives

Mr Sagittarius exclaimed the Prophet I think it right to inform
you that if you mention the architects and their wives again I may very
probably go mad I dont say I shall but I will not answer for myself
Have the goodness to turn them down and follow me

Mr Sagittarius obeyed and followed the Prophet from the room with a
waddling gait and a terrible sensation of having nothing on The coat
and trousers which he wore flapped about him as he descended the stairs
in the wake of the Prophet glancing nervously about him and starting at
the slightest sound In the library they found Madame holding the great
Juvenile upside down and looking exceedingly cross

Will you be good enough to come upstairs said the Prophet to her
very politely though his fingers twitched to strangle her I wish to
present you to my grandmother and dinner is just ready

Madame rose with dignity

I am ready too she said with a click _Semper paratis_

And shaking up the fichu she ascended the stairs Outside the
drawingroom door the Prophet who seemed strangely calm but who was
in reality almost bursting with nervous excitement paused and faced his
old and valued friends

You will forgive my saying so I hope he whispered but my
grandmother is not well and much conversation tires her So we dont
talk too much in her presence Only just now and then you understand

And with this last injunctionfutile he knew as he gave ithe
commended himself to whatever powers there be and opened the door

Sir Tiglath had not yet arrived but Lady Julia Postlethwaite was seated
on a sofa by Mrs Merillia and was conversing with her about the Court
the dreadful amount of money a certain dukeher third cousinhad
recently had to pay in Death Duties the corrupt condition of society
and the absurd pretensions of the lower middle classes Lady Julia was
sensitive and a very _grande dame_ She wore her hair powdered and had
a slight cough and exquisite manners Once a lady in waiting she was
now a widow possessed a set of apartments in Hampton Court Palace
worshipped Queen Alexandra and had scarcely ever spoken to anybody who
moved outside of Court Circles The Duke of Wellington was said to have
embraced her when a child

Mrs Merillia and this lady looked up when the door opened and Lady
Julia paused midway in a sentence of which these were the opening
words

The old duke wouldnt make it over and so poor Loftus has to pay
nearly a million to the Chancellor of the Excheq

How dyou do Lady Julia Grannie I have persuaded my friends Mr
and Madame Sagittarius to join us at dinner Sir Tiglath Butt is
most anxious to meet Mr Sagittarius who is a great astronomer Let
meMadame Sagittarius Mrs MerilliaMr SagittariusMrs Merillia
my grandmotherLady Julia Postlethwaite

Mrs Merillia although taken completely by surprise and fully
conscious that her grandson had committed an outrage in turning an
arranged and intimate quartette without permission into a disorganised
sextette bowed with selfpossessed graciousness and indicated a chair
to Madame who seated herself in it with that sort of defensive and
ostentatious majesty which is often supposed by illbred people to be
a perfect society manner Mr Sagittarius remained standing in his
enormous suit turning out his feet over which Mr Ferdinands trousers
rippled in broadcloth waves in the first position A slight pause
ensued during which the Prophet was uncomfortably affected by the
behaviour of Madame who gazed at the very neat and superior wig worn by
Mrs Merillia and at that ladys charming silver grey damask gown in
a manner that suggested amazement tempered with indignation her instant
expression of these two sentiments being only held in check by a certain
reverence which was doubtless inspired by the pretty room the thick
carpet the ancestral pictures upon the walls and the lofty bearing of
Lady Julia Postlethwaite who could scarcely conceal her very natural
surprise at the extraordinary appearance of Mr Sagittarius As to Mrs
Merillia although she was in reality near fainting with wonder at her
grandsons escapade she preserved an expression of gracious benignity
and did not allow a motion of her eyelids or a flutter of her fan to
betray her emotion at finding herself the unprepared hostess of such
unusual guests The Prophet broke the silence by saying in a voice that
cracked with agitation

I trustI sincerely trust that we shall have a clement spring this
year

Lady Julia at whom he had looked while uttering this original
desire was about to reply when Madame uttered a stentorian click and
interposed

In the spring the young mans fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love
she remarked with the fictitious ease of profound illbreeding

No one dared to dispute the portentous statement and she resumed
majestically

The Mouse is delicious in spring

There was another dead silence and Madame turning with patronising and
heavy affability towards Lady Julia added

Your ladyship doubtless loves the Mouse_Mus Pulcherrimo_in spring
as I do

The Prophet felt as if he were being pricked by thousands of redhot
needles and the perspiration burst out in beads upon his forehead

I am not specially fond of mice in spring or indeed at any season
replied Lady Julia with her slight but very distinct and belllike
cough

I said the Mouse your ladyship returned Madame feeding upon this
titled acquaintance with her bulging black eyes and pushing the kid
boots well out from under her brown skirt I observed that the Mouse
was peculiarly delicious in the season of love

No mouse attracts me said Lady Julia coughing again and raising her
fine eyebrows slightly I should much prefer to pass the spring without
the companionship of any mouse whatever

Both Madame and Mr Sagittarius opened their lips to reply but before
they could eject a single word the door was opened by Mr Ferdinand who
announced

Sir Tiglath Butt

Mr Sagittarius started violently and upset a vase of roses the
astronomer rolled into the room with a very red face and Mr Ferdinand
added

Dinner is served

Mrs Merillia shook hands with Sir Tiglath and glanced despairingly
around her It was sufficiently obvious that she was considering how to
arrange the procession to the diningroom

Hennessey she began will you take Lady Julia Sir Tiglath will
youshe paused but there was no help for it she was obliged to
continuetake Mrs Sagittarius Let me introduce you Sir Tiglath
ButtMrs Sagittarius Mr Sagittarius will you take

Mr Sagittarius roared Sir Tiglath Where is he

That gentleman gathered Mr Ferdinands trousers up in both hands and
prepared for instantaneous flight

Where is he bellowed Sir Tiglath wheeling round with amazing
rapidity for so fat a man Ha

He had viewed Mr Sagittarius who grasping Mr Ferdinands suit in
pleats ducked his head like one wishing to be beforehand with violence
and set the spats towards the door Sir Tiglath advanced upon him

The old astronomer has heard the name of Sagittarius he vociferated
He has been informed that

Its not true sir cried Mr Sagittarius pale with terror It
is not true I deny it I am an AmeriI mean I am not the American
syndicateyou are in error in absolute error I swear it I take the
heavens to witness

At this remarkable and comprehensive statement Mrs Merillia and Lady
Julia looked at each other in elegant amazement

What do you mean sir exclaimed Sir Tiglath And why do you insult
the sacred heavens you an astronomer

I am not an astronomer cried Mr Sagittarius cringing in the
voluminous waistcoat of Mr Ferdinand I am an outside broker I swear
it My dress my manner proclaim the fact Sophronia tell the gentleman
that I am an outside broker and that all Margate has recognised me as
such

My husband states the fact said Madame in response to this
impassioned appeal My husband brokes outside and has done for the
last twenty years Collect yourself Jupiter Pray do not doff your
_toga virilibus_ in the presence of ladies

The terror of Mr Sagittarius was such however that it is very
doubtful whether he would not have proceeded thus to disrobe had not
the Prophet rendered desperate by the turn of events abruptly leaped
between Sir Tiglath and his old and valued friend and gathering the
outraged Lady Julia under his arm exclaimed

Pray praywe can discuss this matter more comfortably at dinner
Permit me Lady Julia Sir Tiglath if you will kindly give your arm to
Madame Sagittarius Mr Sagittarius my grandmother

So saying he made a sort of flank movement so adroitly conceived and
carried out that in the twinkling of an eye he had driven Sir Tiglath
to the side of Madame and hustled Mr Sagittarius into the immediate
neighbourhood of Mrs Merillia Nor had more than two minutes elapsed
before the whole party found themselvesthey scarce knew howarranged
around the dining table and being served with clear soup by Mr
Ferdinand and the astounded Gustavus whose naturally round eyes began
to take an almost oblong form as he attended to the wants of Mrs
Merillias very unfamiliar guests whose outlying demeanour and
architectural manners evidently filled him with the most poignant
dismay

As to Mrs Merillia and Lady Julia the foregoing scene had so reduced
them that they were almost betrayed into some hysterical departure
from the rules of exquisite good breeding which they had unconsciously
observed from the cradle Indeed the latter strong in the belief that
the terms outside broker and raving maniac were interchangeable twice
dropped her spoon into her soupplate before she could succeed in
lifting it to her mouth and was unable to prevent herself from
whispering to the Prophet

Pray Mr Vivian tell me the worstis he absolutely dangerous

No no whispered back the Prophet reassuringly Its all his play

Play murmured Lady Julia glancing at Mr Sagittarius who was
holding back the right sleeve of Mr Ferdinands coat with his left hand
in order to have the free use of his dinner limb

Yes whispered the Prophet Hes the most harmless innocent
creature A child might stroke him I mean he wouldnt hurt a child

Yes but we are not children said Lady Julia still in great
apprehension

Meanwhile Sir Tiglath concerned with his dinner took no heed of Mr
Sagittarius for the moment and that gentleman slightly reassured
endeavoured to make himself agreeable to Mrs Merillia

You are very pleasantly situated here maam he began

Mrs Merillia thought he meant because she was at his elbow and
answered politely

Yes very pleasantly situated

It is indeed a blessing to be within such easy reach of the Stores
added Mr Sagittarius finishing his soup and permitting Mr
Ferdinands sleeves to flow down once more over his hands

The Stores said Mrs Merillia

_O festum dies beatus illa_ ejaculated Madame assuming an expression
of profound and almost passionate sentiment Happy indeed the good lady
who dwells in the central districts

She permitted a gigantic sigh to leave her bosom and to wander freely
among the locks of those at the table Sir Tiglath who on being
assaulted by her learning had shown momentary symptoms of apoplexy now
gave a loud grunt while the Prophet perceiving that his grandmother
and Lady Julia were quite unequal to the occasion hastily replied

Yes Berkeley Square is very convenient in may ways

Ah said Mr Sagittarius keeping a wary eye on Sir Tiglath and
readdressing himself to Mrs Merillia the Berkeley Square But if you
lived in the one behind Kimminss Mews it would be quite another pair
of boots would it not maam

Lady Julia who was sitting next to Mr Sagittarius shifted her chair
nearer to the Prophet and whispered Im sure he is dangerous Mr
Vivian while Mrs Merillia in the greatest perplexity replied

The one behind Mr Kimminss Mews

Ay over against Brigwells Buildings just beyond the Pauper Lunatic
Asylum

Lady Julia turned pale

I daresay answered Mrs Merillia bravely But I am not acquainted
with the neighbourhood you mention

You know the Mouse

At this abrupt return to the subject of mice Lady Julia became really
terrified

Be frank with me Mr Vivian she whispered to the Prophet under
cover of boiled salmon is he a ratcatcher

Good Heavens no whispered back the Prophet Heshes quite the
contrary

But

What mouse said Mrs Merillia endeavouring to seem pleasantly at
ease though she too was beginning to feel a certain amount of alarm
at these strange beings persistent discussion of the inhabitants of the
wainscot Do you allude to any special mouse

I do maam I allude to the Mouse that has helped to make Madame and
self what we are

Sir Tiglath began to roll about in his chair preparatory to some
deliverance and Mrs Merillia casting a somewhat agitated glance at
her grandson answered

Really I did not know that anything so small could have so much
influence

It may be small maam said Mr Sagittarius But to a sensitive
nature it often seems gigantic

You mean at night I suppose Does it disturb you very much

We hear it maam but it lulls us to rest

Indeed That is very fortunate I fear it might keep me awake

So we thought at first But now we should miss it Should we not
Sophronia

Doubtless replied Madame arranging a napkin carefully over her
fichu and dealing rigorously with some mayonnaise sauce It has been
our perpetual companion for many years _mus amicus humano generi_

Sir Tiglath swelled and Mrs Merillia responded

I see a pet Is it white

No maam returned Mr Sagittarius it is a rich chocolate brown
except on wet days Then it takes on the hue of a lead pencil

Indeed said Mrs Merillia trying nobly to remain social How very
curious

We worship it in summer continued Mr Sagittarius In the sultry
season it soothes and calms us

Then it is quite tame

At that time of year but in winter nights it is sometimes almost
wild

Ah I daresay They often are I know

The architects and their wives love it as we do

Do they How very fortunate

We should hate to miss it even for a moment

Oh Mr Vivian whispered Lady Julia this is dreadful Im almost
sure hes brought it with him

No no Its not alive

A dead mouse

Its a river

A river But he said it was a mouse

Its both Mr Sagittarius added the Prophet in a loud and desperate
tone of voice youll find this champagne quite dry You neednt be
afraid of it

Did you get it from by the rabbit shop sir asked Mr Sagittarius
lifting his glass I ordered a dozen in only the day before
yesterday

Lady Julia began to tremble

I see she whispered to the Prophet His mania is about animals

Meanwhile the Prophet had made a warning face at Mr Sagittarius who
suddenly remembered his danger and subsided glancing uneasily at
Sir Tiglath whose intention of addressing him had been momentarily
interfered with by a sweetbread masked in a puree of spinach

Madame Sagittarius assisted by food and dry champagne was nowas the
Prophet perceived with horrorbeginning to feel quite at her ease
She protruded her elbows sat more extensively in her chair rolled her
prominent eyes about the room as one accustomed to her state and said
with condescension to Lady Julia

Is your ladyship to make one of the party at the Zoological Gardens
tonight

Lady Julia who now began to suppose that Mr Sagittariuss crazy
passion for animals was shared by his wife gasped and answered

Are you going to the Zoological Gardens

Yes to an assembly It should be very pleasant Do you make one

I regret that I am not invited said Lady Julia rather stiffly

Madame bridled under the impression that she was scoring off a member
of the aristocracy

Indeed she remarked with a click Yet I presume that your ladyship
is not insensible to the charms of rout and collation

I beg your pardon said Lady Julia beginning to look like an image
made of cast iron

I imagine that the social whirl finds in your ladyship a willing
acolyte

Oh no I go out very little

Indeed said Madame with some contempt Then you do not frequent the
Palace

The Palace Do you mean the Crystal Palace

Of Buckingham You are not an _amicas curiae_

I fear I dont catch your meaning

Does not your ladyship comprehend the Latin tongue

Certainly not said Lady Julia who was born in an age when it was
considered highly improper for a young female to have any dealings with
the ancients Certainly not

Dear me said Madame with pitying amazement You hear her ladyship
Jupiter

I do my angel Madame is a lady of deep education maam said Mr
Sagittarius turning to Mrs Merillia who had been listening to the
foregoing crossexamination with perpetuallyincreasing horror

No decent female should understand Greek or Latin roared Sir Tiglath
at this point If she does shes sure to read a great deal that shes
no business to know anything about

At this challenge Madames bulging brow was overcast with a red cloud

I beg to disagree sir she exclaimed In my opinion the Georgics of
Horatius Homers Idyls and the satires of the great Juvenile

The great what bellowed Sir Tiglath

The great Juvenile sir

There never was a great juvenile maam Talent must be mellow before
it is worth tasting whatever the modern whippersnapper may say There
never was and there never will be a great juvenilethere can only be
a juvenile preparing to be great

Really sir

I affirm it madam And as you seem so mighty fond of Latin remember
what Horace says_Qui cupit opatam cursu contingere metam Multa tulit
fecitque puer sudavit et alsit_ Ohhhh

And Sir Tiglath flung himself back in his chair puffing out his
enormous cheeks and wagging his gigantic head at Madame who for once
in her life seemed entirely at a loss and unable to call to her
assistance a single shred of learning from the library of Dr Carter

Having at last emerged from his Epicurean silence the astronomer now
proceeded to take the floor Satisfied that he had laid a presuming
female low he swung round as if on a pivot to where Mr Sagittarius
was sitting in the greatest agitation and roared

And now sir what is all this about your being an outside broker I was
distinctly informed by this gentleman only a night or two ago that you
were a distinguished astronomer

I am betrayed cried Mr Sagittarius dropping the knife and fork
which he had just picked up for the dissection of a lobster croquette
I said this was a trap I said it was a rattrap from the first

I knew he must be a ratcatcher whispered Lady Julia to the Prophet
who was about to rise from his seat and endeavour to calm his guest I
was certain no one but a ratcatcher could talk in such a manner

He is not indeed Mr Sagittarius pray sit down You are alarming my
grandmother

I cant help that sir I am not going to sit here sir and be slain

Tsh Tsh I merely informed Sir Tiglath the other evening that what
Miss Minerva had told him about you was true

Miss Minerva cried Madame glancing at her husband in a most terrible
manner Miss Minerva

Lady Enid Thistle I mean cried the Prophet mentally cursing the day
when he was born

Whos that exclaimed Madame beginning to look almost exactly like
Medusa

A young female who informed the old astronomer that your husband and an
elderly female named Mrs Bridgeman had for a long while been carrying
on astronomical investigations together

Carrying on together vociferated Madame Jupiter

And that they had come to the conclusion that there was probably oxygen
in certain of the holy fixed stars Oxygen so the elderly female

Oxygen in an elderly female cried Madame in the greatest excitement
Jupiter is this true

Mr Sagittarius was about to bring forward a flat denial when the
Prophet leaning behind the terrified back of Lady Julia hissed in his
ear

Say yes or hell find out who you really are

Yes cried Mr Sagittarius in a catapultic manner

Madame began to show elaborate symptoms of preparation for a largesized
fit of hysterics She caught her breath five or six times running in
a resounding manner heaved her bosom beneath the green chiffon and
coffeecoloured lace and tore feebly with both hands at a large
medallion brooch that was doing sentry duty near her throat

Pray pray Madame exclaimed the Prophet who was now near his wits
end Pray

How can I pray at table sir she retorted suddenly showing fight
You forget yourself

Oh Hennessey said poor Mrs Merillia what does all this mean

Nothing grannie nothing except that Mr Sagittarius is a very modest
man and does not care to acknowledge the greatness of his talents Pray
sit down Mr Sagittarius Here is the ice pudding Madame I am sure
you will take some ice Mr Ferdinand

Sir

The ice to Madame Sagittarius instantly

Mr Ferdinand who was trembling in every limb at having to assist at
such a scene in his diningroom which had hitherto been the very temple
of soft conversation and the most exquisite decorum advanced towards
Madame clattering the flat silver dish and causing the frozen delicacy
that the cook had elegantly posed upon it to run first this way and then
that as if in imitative agitation

I cannot sobbed Madame beginning once more to catch her breath At
such a moment food becomes repulsive

I assure you our cooks ice puddings are quite delicious arent they
grannie

I have no idea Hennessey said Mrs Merillia who was so upset by
the extraordinary scene at which she was presiding in the character
of hostess that she mechanically clutched the left bandeau of her
delightful wig and set it quite a quarter of an inch awry

Try it Madame cried the Prophet I implore you to try it

Thus adjured Madame detached a large piece of the agile pudding with
some difficulty and subsided into a morose silence while her husband
sat with his eyes fixed imploringly upon her totally regardless of his
social duties As both Mrs Merillia and Lady Julia were by this time
thoroughly unnerved and Sir Tiglath was once more immersed in his food
the whole burden of conversation fell upon the Prophet who indulged in
a feverish monologue that lasted until the end of dinner What he talked
about he could never afterwards certainly remember but he had a vague
idea that he discussed the foreign relations of England with Madagascar
the probable future of Poland the social habits of the women of Alaska
the prospects of tobacco culture in West Meath and the effect that
imported Mexicans would be likely to produce upon the natural simplicity
of such unsophisticated persons as inhabit Lundy Island or the more
remote districts of the Shetlands When the ladies at length rose to
leave the diningroom his brain was in a whirl and he had little doubt
that his temperature was up to 104 Nevertheless his mind was still
active was indeed preternaturally acute for the moment and he saw in
a flash the impossibility of leaving Madame Sagittarius alone with his
grandmother and Lady Julia As they got up from their seats he therefore
took out his watch and said

Dear me It is later than I had supposed I am afraid we ought to be
starting for Zoological House Mrs Bridgeman will be expecting us

Certainly sir certainly said Mr Sagittarius with all the alacrity
of supreme cowardice and casting a terrorstricken glance towards Sir
Tiglath who was glowering at him with glassy eyes above a glass of
port Mrs Bridgeman will be expecting us

I will assume my cloak said Madame fiercely Jupiter

My darling

Kindly seek my furs

Certainly my love replied Mr Sagittarius darting eagerly from the
apartment to fetch the rabbitskins

Lady Julia I hope you will forgive us said the Prophet with
passionate contrition If I had had the slightest idea that we should
have the pleasure of seeing you tonight of course I should have given
up this engagement But it is such an old onesettled months agoand I
have promised Mrs Bridgeman so faithfully that

The old astronomer will go with you cried Sir Tiglath at this moment
swallowing his glass of port at a gulp and rolling out of his chair

The Prophet turned cold thinking of Miss Minerva who would be present
at Mrs Bridgemans living her secret double life It was imperative to
prevent the astronomer from accompanying them

I did not think you knew Mrs Bridgeman Sir Tiglath the Prophet
began while Mrs Merillia and Lady Julia stood blankly near the door
trying to look calm and dignified while everyone was ardently preparing
to desert them

The old astronomer must know her before the evening is one hour more
advanced He must question her regarding the holy stars He must examine
her and this Sagittarius who claims to be an outside broker and yet to
have discovered oxygen in the fixed inhabitants of the sacred heavens
My cloak

The last words were bellowed at Gustavus who rushed forward with Sir
Tiglaths Inverness

The Prophet lowed his head and metaphorically threw up the sponge

Lady Julia said Mrs Merillia in a soft voice that slightly
trembled let us go upstairs

The two old ladies bowed with tearful dignity and retired with a sort
of gentle majesty that cut the Prophet to the heart

One moment if you please he said to his guests

And he darted out of the room and leaped up the stairs He found Mrs
Merillia and Lady Julia just about to dispose themselves side by
side upon a sofa near the fire They turned and looked at him with
reproachful doves eyes

GrannieLady Julia he exclaimed I implore your forgiveness Pardon
me Appearances are against me I know But some day you may understand
how I am placed My position ismymy situationIyoudo not wholly
condemn me Waitwait a few days I implore you

He rushed out of the room

The two old ladies seated themselves upon the sofa and tremblingly
spread abroad their damask skirts They looked at each other in silence
shaking their elegant heads Then Mrs Merillia said in a fluttering
voice

Oh Julia you were a lady in waiting to Her Majesty you were kissed
by the great Duketell metell me what it all means

Victoria replied Lady Julia it means that your grandson has fallen
into the clutches of a dangerous and determined ratcatcher

And then the two old ladies mingled their damask skirts and their lace
caps and wept



CHAPTER XVIII

THE SILLY LIFE

Call a cab for Sir Tiglath Mr Ferdinand whispered the Propheta
fourwheeler with a lame horse Ill take both Mr and Madame
Sagittarius in the brougham

Must the horse be lame sir

Yes I absolutely decline to encourage the practice of using good
horses in fourwheeled cabs Its a disgrace to the poor animals It
must be a very lame horse

Yes sir

And Mr Ferdinand standing upon the doorstep whistled to the night

Strange to say in about two minutes there appeared round the corner
the very same cabman who had conveyed the Prophet and Lady Enid to the
astronomers on the previous day driving the very same horse

This horse will do admirably said the Prophet to Mr Ferdinand

He isnt lame sir

Praps not but he knows how to tumble down Sir Tiglath here is a
cab for you We shall go in the brougham Zoological House Regents
Park is the direction Let me help you in Madame

As the Prophet got in to sit bodkin between his old and valued friends
he whispered to the footman

Tell Simkins to drive as fast as possible We are very late

The footman touched his hat Just as the carriage moved off the Prophet
protruded his head from the window and saw the astronomer rolling into
the fourwheeler the horse of which immediately fell down in a most
satisfactory manner

There was no general conversation in the brougham but the Prophet who
was obliged to sit partly on Madame and partly on Mr Sagittarius and
partly on air occasionally heard in the darkness at his back terrible
matrimonial whisperings whose exact tenor he was unable to catch Once
only he heard Madame say sibilantly and with a vicious click

I might have known what to expect when I married a Prophetwhen
I passed over the _pons asinoribus_ to give myself to a _monstram
horrendo_

To this pathetic heartcry Mr Sagittarius made a very prolonged
answer The Prophet knew it was prolonged because Mr Sagittarius always
whispered in such a manner as to tickle the nape of his neck But he
could not hear anything except a sound like steam escaping from a small
pipe The steam went on escaping until the brougham passed through a
gate rolled down a declivity and drew up before an enormous mansion
whose windows blazed with light

Is this the Zoological Gardens inquired Madame in a stern voice Is
this the habitation of the woman Bridgeman

I suppose this is Zoological House replied the Prophet sliding
decorously off Madames left knee in preparation for descent

My darling my love said Mr Sagittarius I swear upon the infant
head of our Capricornus that Mrs Bridgeman and I are

Enough cried Madame _Jam satus_ Be sure that I will inquire into
this matter

The carriage door was opened and with some struggling the Prophet and
his two valued friends emerged and speedily found themselves in a very
large hall which was nearly full of very large powdered footmen In
the distance there was the sound of united frivolities a band of twenty
guitars thrumming a wilful _seguidilla_ Roses bloomed on every side
and beyond the hall they beheld a vision of illuminated vistas down
which vague figures came and went

Evidently when Mrs Bridgeman let herself go she let herself go
thoroughly

Mr Sagittarius gazed about him with awestruck amazement but Madame
was equal to the occasion She cast the rabbitskins imperially to a
neighbouring flunkey arranged her hair and fichu before a glass kicked
out her skirt with the heel of one of the kid boots nipped the green
chiffon into prominence with decisive fingers and then turning to the
Prophet with all the majesty of a suburban empress said in a powerful
voice

Step forward I beg _Jai pret_

The Prophet thus encouraged stepped forward towards an aperture
that on ordinary days contained a door but that now contained a stout
elderly lady with hennadyed hair a powdered face black eyebrows and
a yellow gown on which rested a large number of jewelled ornaments that
looked like small bombs At this ladys elbow stood a footman with an
exceedingly powerful bass voice who shouted the names of approaching
guests in a manner so uncompromising as to be terrific Each time he so
shouted the stout lady first started and then smiled the two operations
succeeding one another with almost inconceivable rapidity and violence

What name sir asked the footman of the Prophet bending his powdered
head till it was only about six feet two inches from the floor

Mr Hennessey Vivian replied the Prophet hesitating as to what he
should add

Mr Hemmerspeed Vivian roared the footman What name Madame to
Madame Sagittarius

Mr and Madame Sagittarius of Sagittarius Lodge the Mouse replied
the lady majestically

Mrand MadameSegerteribusofSegerteribusLodge the Mouse
bawled the footman

The stout lady who was Mrs Vane Bridgeman started and smiled

Delighted to see you Mr Segerteribus she said to the Prophet

The Prophet hastened to explain through the uproar of twenty guitars

Mr Vivian is my name I think Miss Minerva Partridge

Mrs Bridgeman started and smiled

Of course she exclaimed Of course You are to be kind enough to
introduce me some day to Mr SagiSagisomething or other and I am
to introduce him to Sir Tiglath Butt when Sir Tiglath Butt has
been introduced to me by dear Miss Partridge It is all to work out
beautifully Yes yes Charming charming

I have ventured to bring Mr and Madame Sagittarius with me tonight
said the Prophet

Mrs Bridgeman started and smiled

They are my old and valued friends andand here they are

Delighted delighted said Mrs Bridgeman speaking in a confused
manner through the guitars How dyou do Mr Sagittarius

And she shook hands warmly with a very small and saturnine clergyman
decorated with a shock of ebon hair who was passing at the moment

Biggle said the little clergyman

Mrs Bridgeman started and smiled

Biggle repeated the little clergyman Biggle

The guitars rose up with violence and all the hot drubbing passion of
Bayswater being Spanish

Yes indeed I so agree with you dear Mr Sagittarius said Mrs
Bridgeman to the little clergyman

Biggle the little clergyman cried in a portentous voice Biggle
Biggle

What does he mean whispered Mrs Bridgeman to the Prophet How does
one

I think that is his name These are Mr and Madame Sagittarius

Mrs Bridgeman started and smiled

Biggleof course she said to the little clergyman who passed on
with an air of reliant selfsatisfaction Delighted to see you she
added this time addressing the Prophets old and valued friends Ah
Mr SagiSagiumI have heard so much of you from dear Miss Minerva

The wild high notes of a flute played by a silly gentleman from
Tooting shrilled through the tupping of the guitars and Mr
Sagittarius trembling in every limb hissed in Mrs Bridgemans ear

Hush maam for mercys sake

Mrs Bridgeman started and forgot to smile

My loved and honoured wife continued Mr Sagittarius in a loud
and anxious voice more to me than any lunar guide or starry monitor
Madame Sagittarius a lady of deep education maam

Delighted said Mrs Bridgeman making a gracious grimace at Madame
who inclined herself stonily and replied in a sinister voice

It is indeed time that this renconter took place Henceforth maam
I shall be ever at my husbands side _per fus et nefus__et nefus_
maam

So glad said Mrs Bridgeman I have been longing for this

Mr Bernard Wilkins roared the tall footman

Mr Sagittarius started and Mrs Bridgeman did the same and smiled

Bernard Wilkins the Prophet Mr Sagittarius exclaimed From the
Rise

Mrs Eliza Doubleway shouted the footman

Mrs Eliza cried Mr Sagittarius in great excitement Thats the
soothsayer from the Beck

Madame Charlotte Humm yelled the footman

Madame Humm vociferated Mr Sagittarius the crystalgazer from the
Hill

Professor Elijah Chapman bawled the footman

The nosereader piped Mr Sagittarius The nosereader from the
Butts

Verano screamed the footman triumphantly submerging the flute and
the twenty guitars Verano

The South American Irish palmist from the Downs My love said Mr
Sagittarius in a cracking voice we are in it tonight we are indeed
we are fairly and squarely in it

Madame began to bridle and to look as ostentatious as a leviathan

And if we are Jupiter she said in a voice that rivalled the
footmansif we are we are merely in our element They neednt think
to come over me

Hush my love Remember that

Dr Birdie Soames interposed the vibrant bass of the footman

The physiognomy lady from the Common said Mr Sagittarius on the
point of breaking down under the emotion of the moment Scot Scot
Great Scot

Mrs Bridgeman was now completely surrounded by a heterogeneous mass of
very remarkablelooking people among whom were peculiarly prominent an
enormously broadshouldered man with Roman features and his hair cut
over his brow in a royal fringe a small woman with a pointed red nose
in bead bracelets and prunecoloured muslin and an elderly female with
short grizzled hair who wore a college gown and a mortarboard with a
scarlet tassel and who carried in one hand a large skull marked out
in squares with red ink These were Verano the Irish palmist from the
Downs Mrs Eliza Doubleway the soothsayer from Beck and Dr Birdie
Soames the physiognomy lady from the Common Immediately around these
celebrities were grouped a very pale gentleman in a short jacket who
looked as if he made his money by eating nothing and drinking a great
deal a plethoric female with a mundane face in which was set a large
and delicately distracted grey eye and a gentleman with a jowl a pug
nose and a large quantity of brasscoloured hair about as curly as hay
which fell down over a low collar round which was negligently knotted
a huge black tie This trio comprised Mr Bernard Wilkins the Prophet
from the Rise Madame Charlotte Humm the crystalgazer from the Hill
and Professor Elijah Chapman the nosereader from the Butts No sooner
was the news of the arrival of these great and notorious people bruited
abroad through the magnificent saloons of Zoological House than Mrs
Bridgemans guests began to flock around them from all the four quarters
of the mansion deserting even the neighbourhood of the guitars and the
inviting seclusion of the various refreshmentrooms From all sides
rose the hum of comment and the murmur of speculation Pincenez were
adjusted eyeglasses screwed into eyes fingers pointed feet elevated
upon uneasy toes Pretty girls boldly trod upon the gowns of elderly
matrons in the endeavour to draw near to Mrs Bridgeman and her group
of celebrities youths pushed and shoved chaperons elbowed and old
gentlemen darted from one place to another in wild endeavours to find an
inlet through the press And amid this frantic scramble of the curious
the famous members of the occult world stood calmly conscious of their
value and in no wise upset or discomposed Verano stroked his Roman
features and ran his large white hand through his curly fringe Dr
Birdie Soames tapped her skull Mrs Eliza Doubleway played with her
bead bracelets Mr Bernard Wilkins and Madame Charlotte Humm conversed
together in dreamy murmurs while Professor Elijah Chapman shook
his brasscoloured hair till it fell forward over his variegated
shirtfront and glanced inquiringly at the multitudes of anxious noses
which offered themselves to his inspection beneath the glare of the
electric lights

Mr and Madame Sagittarius completely overlooked in the throng
elbowed trampled upon jogged from behind and prodded from before
gazed with a passion of bitter envy at their worshipped rivals who were
set in the full blaze of success while they languished in the outer
darkness of anonymous obscurity

_O miseris hominum men_dont set your feet on me sir if you
please cried Madame _O pectorae caec_maam I beg you to take your
elbow from my throat this minute

But even her powerful and indignant organ was lost in the hubbub that
mingled with the wild music of the guitars to which was now added the
tinkle of bells and the vehement click of a round dozen of castanets
marking the bullfighting rhythm of a new air called The Espadas
Return to Madrid

Jupiter she gurgled I shall be suff

Mr Amos Towle roared the footman savagely

The great medium from the Wick

Towle the seer

Amos Towle the famous spiritualist

Mr Towle who materialises

The celebrated Towle

The great and only Towle

Oh is it _the_ Towle

I must see Towle

Where is he Oh where is Towle

Towle who communicates with the other world

Towle the magician

Towle the hypnotist

Towle the soothsayer

The magnetic Towle

The electric Towle

We mustwe must see Towle

Such were a very few of the exclamations that instantly burst forth upon
the conclusion of the footmans announcement The elbowing and trampling
became more violent than ever and Mrs Bridgeman was forcedfrom
lack of roomto forego her society start though she was still able
to indulge in her society smile as she bowed with almost swooning
graciousness to a short perspiring bald and sidewhiskered man in
greasy broadcloth who looked as if he would have been quite at home
upon the box of a fourwheeled cab as indeed he would seeing that he
had driven a growler for fiveandtwenty years before discovering
that he was the great and only Towle medium seer and
workerofmiraclesinchief to the large and increasing crowd that lives
the silly life

Oh Mr Towlecharmed delighted cried Mrs Bridgeman I was so
afraidHow sweet of you to come out all this way from your eyrie at
the Wick Youll find many friendsdear Madame Charlottethe
ProfessorMrs Elizatheyre all here And Miss Minerva too Your
greatest admirer and disciple

At this moment the crowd wild in its endeavour to touch the inspired
broadcloth of the great Towle surged forward and the Prophet was
driven like a ram against the left side of his hostess

I begyourpard he gasped but could you tellmewhere Miss
Minervervais I specially want toto

I think shes with Eureka in tearoom number 1 replied Mrs
Bridgeman Oh dear Near the band Oh dear Oh my gown Oh So
sweet of you to come Mrs Lorrimer Just a few interesting people Oh
gracious mercy Oh for goodness sake

She was thrust against a new arrival and the Prophet bringing
his shoulders vigorously into play according to the rules of Rugby
football presently found himself out in the open and free to wander in
search of Miss Minerva whom he was most anxious to encounter before
the arrival of Sir Tiglath Butt which must now be imminent despite the
marked disinclination of his horse to proceed at the rate of more than
half a mile an hour

The Prophet abandoned Mr and Madame Sagittarius to their fate
thankful indeed to be rid for a moment of their prophetic importunity

Following the gasped directions of Mrs Bridgeman he made towards the
guitars threading a number of drawingrooms and passing by the doors
of various mysterious chambers which were carefully curtained off in
a most secret manner Here and there he saw groups of peoplemen in
extraordinary coats and with touzled masses of hair women in gowns made
of the cheapest materials and cut in the most impossible fashions Some
wore convolvulus on their heads ivyleaves trailing fuchsia or sprigs
of plants known only to suburban haberdashers others appeared boldly
in caps of the porkpie order adorned with cherrycoloured streamers
clumps of feathers that had never seen a bird bunches of shining
fruits or coins that looked as if they had just emerged from the
seclusion of the poorbox Thread gloves abounded and were mostly in
what saleswomen call the loud shadesbright scarlet marigold yellow
grass green or acute magenta Mittens too were visible covered with
cabalistic inscriptions in glittering beadwork Not a few gentlewomen
like Madame trod in elasticsided boots and one small but intrepid
lady carried herself boldly in a cotton skirt topped with a tartan
blouse carried out in vermilion and sulphur colour over which
was carelessly adjusted a macintosh cape partially trimmed with
distressedlooking swansdown Here and there might be seen some smart
London woman perfectly dressed and glancing with amused amazement
at the new fashions about her here and there a well setup man with
normal hair and a tie that would not have terrified Piccadilly But
for the most part Mrs Bridgemans guests were not quite usual in
appearance and indeed were such as the Prophet had never gazed upon
before

Presently the uproar of the guitars grew more stentorian upon his ear
and leaving on his left an astonishing chamber that contained from a
dozen to fifteen small round tables with nothing whatever upon them
the Prophet emerged into an inner hall where in quite a grove of shrubs
hung with fairy lights twenty young ladies dressed from top to toe in
scarlet and each wearing a large golden medal were being as Spanish
as if they had not been paid for it while twelve more whacked castanets
and shook bells with a frenzy that was worth an excellent salary the
silly gentleman from Tooting the while blowing furiously upon his flute
and combining this intemperate indulgence with an occasional assault
upon a cottage piano that stood immediately before him or a wave of
the baton that asserted his right to the position of _chef dorchestre_
Immediately beyond this shrine of music the Prophet perceived a Moorish
nook containing a British buffet and in quite the most Moorish corner
of this nook seated upon a divan that would have been at home in
Marakesh he caught sight of Miss Minerva in company with a thin
fatigued and wispy lady in a very long vermilion gown and an extremely
small gentlemanapparently of the Hebrew persuasionwho was smartly
dressed wore white gloves and a buttonhole and indulged in a great
deal of florid gesticulation while talking with abnormal vivacity Miss
Minerva who was playing quietly with a lemon ice looked even more
sensible than usual the Prophet thought in her simple white frock She
seemed to be quite at home and perfectly happy with her silly friends
but as soon as she saw him hovering anxiously to the left of the
guitars she beckoned to him eagerly and he hurried forward

Oh Mr Vivian Im so glad youve come Let me introduce you to my
great friend Eurekathe lady in vermilion bowed absentmindedly and
rolled her huge brown eyes wearily at the Prophetand to Mr Briskin
Moses

The little gentleman made a stage reverence and fluttered his small
hands airily

Pretty sight pretty sight he said in a quick and impudent voice
All these little dears enjoying themselves so innocently Mother
Bridgemans chickens I call them But its impossible to count them
even after theyre hatched Cheese it

The final imperative was flung demurely at a mighty footman who just
then tried to impound Mr Mosess not quite finished brandyandsoda

Sir said the mighty footman

Cheese it cried Mr Moses making a gesture of tragic repugnance in
the direction of the footman

The mighty footman cheesed it with dignity and afterwards in the
servants hall spoke very bitterly of Israel

The Prophet was extremely anxious to get a word alone with Miss Minerva
Indeed it was really important that he should warn her of Sir Tiglaths
approach but he could find no opportunity of doing so for Mr Moses
who was not afflicted with diffidence rapidly continued in a slightly
affected and tripping cockney voice

Mother Bridgemans a dear one God bless her for a pretty soul Shed
be sublime in musical comedythe black satin society lady you know
who makes the aristocratic relief

Im a Dowager Duchess and everyone knows Im a lady right down to
the tip of my toes

Very valuable among the minxes worth her weight in halfcrowns Id
give her an engagement any day pretty bird Ever seen her driving in
a cab She takes off her gloves and spreads her hands over the apron
to get the air A canary Anything for me tonight Eureka A dove a
mongooseanything lucky Give us a chance mother

The lady in vermilion who had a tuft of golden hair in the midst of her
otherwise raven locks glanced mysteriously at Mr Moses

See anything mother he asked with theatrical solemnity A tiny
chunk of luck for tricky little Briskin

I do see something said Eureka in a dim and heavy voice Its just
close to you on that table by the brandy

Mr Moses started and cast a glance of awe at the tumbler

My word he criedmy word mother Whats the blessed little symbol
like Not a pony fresh from Jerusalem for your believing boy

You must wait a moment It is not clear replied Eureka slowly
and dreamily fixing her heavy eyes on the brandyandsoda Its all
cloudy

Been imbibing mother Has the blessed little symbol been at it again
Briskins shockshocked

Its getting clearer It stands in a band of fire

Shade of Shadrach Apparition of Abednego Draw it mild and bitter
mother

Ah now it steps out Its got a hump

Got the hump mother My word then it must be either a camel or an
undischarged bankrupt Which is it pretty soul

Its a rhinoceros Its moving to you

Yokohama mother Tell the pretty bird to keep back Whats it mean

Its a sign of plenty

Plenty of what mother The ready or the nosebag Give us a chance

Plenty of good fortune because its head is towards you If it had
presented its tail it would mean black weather

Dont let it turn tail for Saturdays sake mother Keep its head
straight while I finish the brandy

And so saying little Mr Moses with elaborate furtiveness caught up
the tumbler poured its contents down his throat and threw himself back
on the divan with the air of a man who had just escaped from peril
by the consummate personal exercise of unparalleled and sustained
ingenuity

During this scene Miss Minerva had preserved her air of pronounced
Scottish good sense while listening attentively and she now said to
Eureka

Dyou see anything for Mr Vivian dear Eureka Even the littlest thing
would be welcomed

Eureka stared upon the Prophet who began to feel very nervous

Theres something round his head she remarked with her usual almost
sacred earnestness

The Prophet mechanically put up his hands like a man anxious to
interfere with the assiduous attentions of a swarm of bees

Something right round his head

Is it a halo asked Miss Minerva

Is it a Lincoln  Bennet mother cried Mr Moses One of the shiny
onestwentyone bob and twentyfiveandsix if you want a kid lining

No its like some sort of bird

I heard the owl beneath my eaves complaining chirped Mr Moses
taking two or three high notes in a delicate tenor voice I looked
forthgreat Scot How it was raining Is it an owl mother Ask it to
screech to Briskin

It is no owl said Eureka to the Prophet It is a sparrowyour
bird

Is it upon the housetop mother having a spree all on its little
alone

No it is hovering over the gentleman

What does that mean said the Prophet anxiously

But at this point Eureka suddenly seemed to lose interest in the matter
Oh youre all right she said carelessly Im tired I should like a
wafer

Mothers peckish Mother I see an ostrich by your left elbow Thats a
sign that youre so peckish you could swallow anything Waiter

Sir

This ladys so peckish she could eat anything Bring her some tintacks
and a wafer Stop a sec Another brandy for Briskin Your calvesd do
for the front row pon my word they would Trot boy trot

I must speak to you alone for one moment whispered the Prophet to
Miss Minerva under cover of the quips of Mr Moses Sir Tiglaths
coming

Miss Minerva started

Sir Tig she exclaimed and put her finger to her lips just in time to
stop the lath from coming out Mr Moses Im going to the buffet for
a moment with Mr Vivian Eureka darling do eat something substantial
All this second sight takes it out of you

Eureka acquiesced with a heavy sigh Mr Moses cried Aunt Eurekas so
hungry that one would declare she could even eat oats if she found they
were there and Miss Minerva and the Prophet moved languidly towards
the buffet endeavouring by the indifference of their movements to
cover the agitation in their hearts

Sir Tiglath coming here cried Miss Minerva under her breath as soon
as they were out of earshot But he doesnt know Mrs Bridgeman

I knowbut hes coming And not only that Mr and Madame Sagittarius
are here already

Miss Minerva looked closely at the Prophet in silence for a moment Then
she said

I seeI see

What cried the Prophet in great anxiety not the sparrow on my
head

No But I see that youre taking to your double life in real earnest

I

Yes Now Mr Vivian thats all very well and you know Im the last
person to complain of anything of that sort so long as it doesnt get
me into difficulties

Think of the difficulties you and everyone else have got me into
ejaculated the poor Prophet for once in his life stepping perhaps a
hairsbreadth from the paths of good breeding

Well Im sure Ive done nothing

Nothing said the Prophet losing his head under the influence of the
guitars which were now getting under way in a fantasia on Carmen
Nothing Why you made me come here you insisted on my introducing Mr
Sagittarius to Mrs Bridgeman you told Sir Tiglath Mrs Bridgeman and
I were old friends and had made investigations together assisted by Mr
Sagittarius you

Oh well thats nothing But Sir Tiglath mustnt see me here as Miss
Minerva Has he arrived yet

I dont think so Hes got the cab we had yesterday and the horse

The one that tumbles down so cleverly when its not too tired Capital
Run to the cloakroom meet Sir Tiglath there and persuade him to go
home

But here the Prophet struck

I regret I cant he said almost firmly

But you must

I regret sincerely that I am unable

Why Mr Vivian when a lady asks you

I am grieved said the Prophet with a species of intoxicated
obstinacythe guitars seemed to be playing inside his brain and the
flute piping in the small of his backto decline but I cannot
contend physically with Sir Tiglath a man whom I reverence in the
cloakroom of a total stranger

I dont ask you to contend physically

Nothing but personal violence would keep Sir Tiglath from coming in

Really Then whats to be done

She pursed up her sensible lips and drew down her sensible eyebrows

I know she cried after a moments thought Ill masquerade tonight
as myself

As yourself

Yes All these dear silly people here think that Ive got an astral
body

Whats that

A sort of floating businessa business that you can set floating

Whata company

No no A replica of yourself The great Towle

Hes here tonight

I knew he was coming Well the great Towle detached this astral body
once at a seance and for a jokea silly joke you know

Yes yes

I christened it by my real name Lady Enid Thistle and said Lady Enid
was an ancestress of mine

Why did you

Because it was so idiotic

I see

Well Ive only now to spread a report among these dear creatures that
Im astral tonight and get Towle to back me up and I can easily be
Lady Enid for an hour or two In this crowd Sir Tiglath need never find
out that Im generally known in these circles as Miss Partridge

Do you really think

Yes I do But I must find Towle at once

So saying she hastened away from the buffet followed by the trotting
Prophet As she passed Eureka and Mr Moses she said

Eureka darling do I look odd I suddenly began to feel astral just as
I was going to eat a sandwich I cant help thinking that Lady Enidyou
know my astral ancestress whos always with meis peculiarly powerful
tonight Dyou notice anything

Watch out for it mother cried Mr Moses See if its got the lump

Eureka fixed her heavy eyes on Miss Minerva and swayed her thin body to
and fro in as pantherlike a manner as she could manage

Mothers after it continued Mr Moses twitching his left ear with
his thumb in a Hebraic manner and shooting his shining cuffs mothers
on the trail Doves for a bishop and the little mangelwurzel for the
labouring man Clever mother Shell take care its suitable Is it a
haggis mother hovering over the lady with outspread wings

Eureka closed her eyes and rocked herself more violently

I see you she said in a deep voice You are astral You are Lady
Enid emerged for an hour from our dear Minerva

I thought so cried Lady Enid with decision I thought so because
when someone called me Miss Minerva just now I felt angry and didnt
seem to know what they meant Tell them dear Eurekatell all my
friends of your discovery

And she hastened on with the Prophet in search of the great Towle

Ill get him to back Eureka up and then it will be quite safe she
said Ah there he is with Harriet Browne the demonstrator from the
Rye

Indeed at this moment a small crowd was visible in one of the further
drawingrooms moving obsequiously along in reverent attendance upon the
great Towle Mrs Bridgeman and a thickset redfaced lady without
a waist and plainly clad in untrimmed linseywolsey who was speaking
authoritatively to a hystericallooking young girl upon whose narrow
shoulder she rested a heavy fatfingered hand as she walked

Harriets evidently going to demonstrate added Lady Enid Thats
lucky because then I can get a quiet word with Towle

Demonstrate said the Prophet

Yes Shes the great Christian Scientist and has the healing power
She demonstrated over Agatha Marshalls left ear You know The case got
into the papers Ah Harriet darling

My blessing My Minerva said Harriet in a thick and guttural voice

Lady Enid Harriet love tonight Eureka says Im astral Oh Mr
Towle what an honour to meet youwhat an honour for us all

The great Towle ducked and scraped in cabman fashion

Oh will you materialise for us tonight

Yes yes cried Mrs Bridgeman trembling with excitement Hes
promised to after supper He says he feels less material thenmore _en
rapport_ with the dear spirits

How delightful Mr Towle tell me do you agree with Eureka I await
your fiat Am I astral

Ay miss as like as not said the great man twisting his lips as if
they held a straw between them Astral thats it Thats it to a T

Then Im Lady Enid Thistle my ancestress whos always with me

Ay ay Every bit of her Her ladyship to a T

The company was much impressed and whispers of Its Lady Enid Eureka
and Mr Towle say its her ladyship in the astral plane flew like
wildfire through the rooms

At this point Harriet Browne who was sufficiently Christian and
scientific to like to have all the attention of the company centred upon
her cleared her throat loudly and exclaimed

If I am to heal this poor sufferer I must be provided with an
armchair

An armchair for Mrs Browne

Fetch a chair for Harriet

Mrs Harriet cant demonstrate without a chair

What is she going to do whispered the Prophet to Lady Enid feeling
thoroughly ashamed of his ignorance

Demonstrate

Yes but whats that

Put her hands over that girl and think about her

Is that all

Yes

Does she do it out of kindness

Of course But shes paid something not because she wants to be paid
but because its the rule

Oh

An armchair was now wheeled forward and Mrs Harriet ensconced herself
in it comfortably

Im very tired tonight she remarked in her thick voice Ive had a
hard afternoon

Poor darling cried Mrs Bridgeman Fetch a glass of champagne for
Mrs Harriet somebody Oh would you Mr Brummich

Mr Brummich a gentleman with a remarkably foolish ascetic face and
a feeblywandering sandy beard was just about to hasten religiously
towards the Moorish nook when the great Towle happened by accident to
groan Mrs Bridgeman started and smiled

Oh and a glass of champagne for Mr Towle too dear Mr Brummich

Certainly Mrs Bridgeman said dear Mr Brummich hurrying off with
the demeanour of the head of an Embassy entrusted with some important
mission to a foreign Court

Were you at work this afternoon Harriet beloved inquired Mrs
Bridgeman of Mrs Browne who was leaning back in the armchair with her
eyes closed and in an attitude of severe prostration

Yes

Which was it lovebird Hysteric Henry

No hes cured

Cries of joy resounded from those gathered about the chair

Hysteric Henrys cured

Henrys better

The poor man with the ball in his throats been saved

How wonderful you are Harriet sweet cried Mrs Bridgeman But
then which was it

The madwoman at Brussels Ive been thinking about her for two hours
this afternoon with only a cup of tea between

Poor darling No wonder youre done up Ought you to demonstrate Ah
heres the champagne

I take it merely as medicine said Mrs Harriet

At this moment Mr Brummich flushed with assiduity burst into the
circle with a goblet of beaded wine in either hand There was a moment
of solemn silence while Mrs Harriet and the great Towle condescended
to the Pommery It was broken only by a loud gulp from the
hystericallooking girl who was it seemed nervously affected by an
imitative spasm and who suddenly began to swallow nothing with extreme
persistence and violence

Look at that poor misguided soul ejaculated Mrs Harriet with her
lips to the Pommery She fancies shes drinking

The poor misguided soul yielded again to her distraught imagination
amid the pitiful ejaculations of the entire company with the exception
of one mundane young man who suddenly assailed by the wild fancy that
he wasnt drinking crept furtively to the Moorish rook and was no more
seen

Give her a cushion continued Mrs Harriet authoritatively

Mr Brummich said Mrs Bridgeman

Mr Brummich ran and returned with a cushion

Sit down poor thing Sit at my feet said Mrs Harriet giving the
hystericallooking girl a healing push

The girl subsided in a piteous heap and Mrs Harriet who had by this
time taken all her medicine leant over her and inquired

Where dyou feel it

The girl put her hands to her head

Here she said feebly Its like fire running over me and drums
beating

Fire and drums announced Mrs Harriet to the staring assembly
Thats what shes got poor soul

Ejaculations of sympathy and horror made themselves heard

Drums How shocking cried Mrs Bridgeman Can you cure even drums
Harriet my own

Give me ten minutes Catherine I ask but that

And so saying Mrs Harriet planted her fat hands upon the head of the
young patient closed her eyes and began to breathe very hard

Silence now fell upon the people who said not a word but who could not
prevent themselves from rustling as they pressed about this exhibition
of a latterday apostle The Prophet and Lady Enid were close to the
armchair and the Prophet who had never before been present at any such
ceremonyit was accompanied by the twenty guitars now tearing out the
serenade From the bullring I come to theewas so interested that
he completely forgot Mr and Madame Sagittarius and lost for the moment
all memory of Sir Tiglath The silly life engrossed him He had no eyes
for anyone but Mrs Harriet who as she leaned forward in the chair
with closed eyes looked like a determined middleaged man about to
offer up the thin girl on the footstool as a burnt sacrifice

Youre better now poor thing said Mrs Harriet after five minutes
has elapsed Youre feeling much better

Oh no Im not said the girl shaking her head under the hands of
the demonstrator The fires blazing and the drums are beating like
anything

Mrs Harriets hue deepened and there was a faint murmur of vague
reproof from the company

Hsh said the demonstrator closing her hands upon the patients head
with some acrimony Hsh

And she began to breathe hard once more Another five minutes elapsed
and then Mrs Harriet exclaimed with decision

There Its gone now all gone Ive sent it right away The fires out
and the drums have stopped beating

Exclamations of wonder and joy rose up from the spectators They were
however a trifle premature for the hysterical girlwho was it
seemed a person of considerable determination despite her feeble
appearancereplied from the footstool

No it isnt No they havent

Mrs Harriet developed a purple shade

Nonsense she said Youre cured love entirely cured

Im not said the girl beginning to cry I feel much worse since you
pressed my head

There was a burst of remonstrance from the crowd and Mrs Harriet
speaking with the air of an angry martyr remarked

Its just like the drinkingshe fancies she isnt cured when she is
just the same as she fancied she was drinking when she wasnt

This unanswerable logic naturally carried conviction to everyone
present and the hysterical girl was warmly advised to make due
acknowledgement of the benefits received by her at the healing hands
of Mrs Harriet while the latter was covered with compliments and
assiduously conducted towards the buffet escorted by the great Towle

Isnt she wonderful said Mrs Bridgeman turning ecstatically to
the person nearest to her who happened to be the saturnine little
clergyman Isnt she marvellous MrerMr Segerteribus

Biggle cried the little clergyman

I beg your pardon

Biggle vociferated the little clergyman Biggle

Certainly Did you ever see anything like that cure Ah you ought to
preach about dear Harriet Mr Segerteribus you really

Biggle reiterated the little clergyman excitedly Biggle Biggle

What does he began Mrs Bridgeman turning helplessly towards the
Prophet

Its his name I fancy whispered the Prophet

Mrs Bridgeman started and smiled

Mr Biggle she said

The little clergyman moved on towards the guitars with all the air of
a future colonial bishop Mrs Bridgeman who seemed to be somewhat
confused and whose manner grew increasingly vague as the evening wore
on now said to those nearest to her

There are fifteen tables set outyes set outin the green boudoir

Bedad remarked an Irish colonel then its meselfll enjoy a good
rubber

For tableturning added Mrs Bridgeman Materialisation in the
same room after supper Mr Towleyeswill enter the cabinet at about
eleven Wheres Madame Charlotte

Looking into the crystal for Lady Ferrier said someone

Oh and the professor

Hes reading Archdeacon Andrews nose by the cloakroom

Mrs Bridgeman sighed

It seems to be going off quite pleasantly she said vaguely to the
Prophet I thinkperhapsmight I have a cup of tea

The Prophet offered his arm Mrs Bridgeman took it They walked
forward and almost instantly came upon Sir Tiglath Butt who with
a face even redder than usual was rolling away from the hall of the
guitars holding one enormous hand to his ear and snorting indignantly
at the various clairvoyants cardreaders spiritualists and palmists
whom he encountered at every step he took The Prophet turned pale and
Lady Enid who was just behind him put on her most sensible expression
and moved quickly forward

Ah Sir Tiglath she said How delightful of you to come Catherine
dear let me introduce Sir Tiglath Butt to you Sir Tiglath ButtMrs
Vane Bridgeman

Mrs Bridgeman behaved as usual

So glad she said So enchanted Just a few interesting people So
good of you to come Tableturning is

At this moment Lady Enid nipped her friends arm and Sir Tiglath
exclaimed looking from Mrs Bridgeman to the Prophet

What madam So youre the brain and eye eh Is that it

The guitars engaged in The Gipsies of Granada are wild as mountain
birds and Mrs Bridgeman looked engagingly distraught and replied

Ah yes indeed The brain and I Sir Tiglath so good of you to say
so

You prompted his interest in the holy stars continued Sir Tiglath
speaking very loud and still stopping one ear with his hand You drove
him to the telescope you told him to clear the matter up did you

What matter said Mrs Bridgeman trying not to look as stupid as she
felt but only with moderate success

Say the oxygen darling whispered Lady Enid in one of her ears

Say the oxygen hissed the Prophet into the other

The occiput said Mrs Bridgeman hearing imperfectly Oh yes Sir
Tiglath I told himI told Mr Biggleto make quite sureyes as to
the occiput matter

The saturnine little clergyman who was again in motion near by caught
his name and stopped as Sir Tiglath roaring against The Gipsies of
Granada continued

And your original adviser was Mr Sagittarius was he

On hearing a word she understood Mrs Bridgeman brightened up and
perceiving the little clergyman she answered

Mr Sagittariusah yes Sir Tiglath is speaking of you Mr
Sagittarius

The little clergyman turned almost black in the face

Biggle he exclaimed in a voice of thunder Biggle Biggle

And without further parley he rushed to the cloakroom seized someone
elses hat and coat and fared forth into the night Lady Enid who had
meant to coach Mrs Bridgeman very carefully for the meeting with Sir
Tiglath but whose plans were completely upset by the astronomers
premature advent now endeavoured to interpose

By the way she said in a very calm voice where is dear Mr
Sagittarius I havent seen him yet

Im afraid hes angry with me said Mrs Bridgeman alluding to the
little clergyman I really cant think why

Sir Tiglath said Lady Enid boldly taking the astronomers arm Come
with me I want you to find Mr Sagittarius for me Yes they do make
rather a noise

This was in allusion to the guitars for the astronomer had now placed
both hands over his ears in the vain endeavour to exclude The Gipsies
Deafness perhaps rendered him yielding In any case he permitted Lady
Enid to detach him from Mrs Bridgeman and to lead him through the rooms
in search of Mr Sagittarius

Perhaps hes here said Lady Enid entering a darkened chamber Oh
no

And she hastily moved away perceiving a large number of devoted
adherents of tabletapping busily engaged with outspread fingers and
solemn faces at their intellectual pursuit Avoiding the archdeacon
who was now having his nose read by the professor she conducted the
astronomer rendered strangely meek by the guitars into a drawingroom
near the hall in which only four people remainedVerano and Mrs
Eliza Doubleway who were conferring in one corner and Mr and Madame
Sagittarius who were apparently having rather more than a few words
together in another

Ah theres Mr Sagittarius said Lady Enid

Minnie cried Mrs Eliza beckoning to Lady Enid Minnie ducky

Lady Enid pretended not to hear and tried to hasten with the astronomer
towards the Sagittariuses But Mrs Eliza was not to be put off

Minnie my pet she piped Come here Minnie

Lady Enid was obliged to pause

What is it dear Eliza she asked at the same time making a face at
the soothsayer to indicate caution

Mrs Eliza and Verano rose and approached Lady Enid and the astronomer

I was laying the cards last night at Jane Seamansyou know dear the
Angel Gabriel who lives on the Hackney Downsand whatever do you think
The hace of spades came up three times in conjugation with the Knave of
earts

Terrific Very great buzzed Verano with a strong South American
Irish broguea real broth of a brogue

Wonderful said Lady Enid hastily endeavouring to pass on

Wait a minute darling Well I says to JaneI was laying the cards
for her usband dearI says to Jane I says without doubt Hisaac is
about to pass over I says seeing the red boys come up in conjugation
with the hace Lord Mrs Eliza Lay them out again she says for
she says if Hike is going to pass over she says

Extraordinary dear Mrs Eliza Youre a genius cried Lady Enid in
despair

Tremendous Very big buzzed Verano staring at Sir Tiglath You got
a very spatulate hand there sir Allow me

And to Lady Enids horror he seized the astronomers hand with both his
own

How dare you tamper with the old astronomer sir roared Sir Tiglath
Am I in a madhouse Who are all these crazy Janes Drop my hand sir

Verano obeyed rather hastily and Lady Enid convoyed the spluttering
astronomer towards the corner which contained Mr and Madame
Sagittarius

Now these worthies were in a mental condition of a most complicated
kind The reception at Zoological House had upset in an hour the
theories and beliefs of a lifetime Hitherto Madame had always been
filled with shame at the thought that she was not the wife of an
architect but of a prophet and Mr Sagittarius had endeavoured to
assume the mein and costume of an outside broker and had dreamed dreams
of retiring eventually from a hated and despised profession But now
they found themselves in a magnificent mansion in which the secondrate
members of their own tribe were worshipped and adored smothered with
attentions plied with Pommery and looked upon as gods while they in
their incognito were neglected and paid no more heed to than if they
had been in reality mere architects and outside brokers totally
unconnected with that mysterious occult world which is the fashion of
the moment

This position of affairs had not unnaturally thrown then into a
condition of the gravest excitement Madame more especially had
reached boiling point Feeling herself for the first time an Imperial
creature in exile who had only to declare herself to receive instant
homage and to be overwhelmed with the most flattering attentions
her lust of glory developed with alarming rapidity and she urged her
husband to cast the traditions that had hitherto guided him to the
winds and to declare forthwith his identity with Malkiel the Second the
businesslike and as it were official head of the whole prophetic tribe

Mr Sagittarius for his part was also fired with the longing for
instant glory but he was by nature an extremely timidor shall we
say rather an extremely prudentman He remembered the repeated
injunctions of his great forebear who had lived and died in the Susan
Road beside the gasworks More he remembered Sir Tiglath Butt He was
torn between ambition and terror

Declare yourself Jupiter cried Madame Declare yourself this
moment

My love replied Mr Sagittarius My angel we must reflect

I have reflected retorted Madame

There are difficulties my dear many difficulties in the way

And what if there are _Per augustum ad augustibus_ Every fool knows
that

My dear you are a little hard upon me

And what have you been upon me I should like to know What about those
goingson with the woman Bridgeman What about your investigations with
that hussy Minerva Youve been her owl thats what youve been

She began to show grave symptoms of hysteria Mr Sagittarius patted her
hands in great anxiety

My love I have told you I have sworn

And what man doesnt swear whenever he gets the chance cried Madame
Why did I ever marry _Heu miserum me_

My angel be calm I assure you

Very well then declare yourself Jupiter this minute or Ill declare
yourself for you

But my love think of Sir Tiglath I dare not declare myself He
will be here at any moment and he has sworn to kill me if Im not an
American syndicate

Rubbish

But my

Rubbish Thats only what Mr Vivian says

Well but

Besides you can put on your _toga virilibus_ and knock him down Its
no use talking to me Jupiter

I know it isnt my darling I know But

If you dont declare yourself I shall declare yourself for you this
very moment I will not endure to be left in the corner while all these
nobodies are being truckled to Bernard Wilkins indeed A prophet
we wouldnt so much as recognise to be a prophet and that there Mrs
Elizapeople from the Wick going down to supper in front of us and
a man from the Butts put before you Its right down disgusting and I
wont have it

It was exactly at this point in the matrimonial conference that Lady
Enid and Sir Tiglath Butt shaking themselves free of Mrs Eliza and
Verano bore down upon Mr and Madame Sagittarius who were so busily
engaged in disputation that they did not perceive that anyone was near
until Lady Enid touched Mr Sagittarius upon the arm

That gentleman started violently and on perceiving Sir Tiglath Butt
who was positively sputtering with wrath at the palmistic attentions
paid to him by Verano shrank against his wife who pushed him
vigorously from her and getting upon her feet announced in a loud
voice

Very well Jupiter since you wont declare yourself I shall go at once
to the woman Bridgeman and declare yourself for you

And with this remark she scowled at Lady Enid and walked majestically
away tossing her head vehemently at Mrs Eliza and Verano as she swept
into the adjoining drawingroom

Dear me said Lady Enid with great curiosity Dear me Mr
Sagittarius is your wife going to make a declaration This is most
interesting

And moved by her besetting idiosyncrasy she added to the astronomer
Excuse me Sir Tiglath Ill be back in one moment and glided
swiftly away in the wake of Madame leaving Mr Sagittarius and his
deadliest foe _teteatete_

Is this a madhouse sir cried Sir Tiglath on being thus abandoned
The old astronomer demands to know at once if one is or is not in a
vast madhouse

I dont know sir indeed replied Mr Sagittarius I should not like
to express an opinion on the point If you will excu

Sir the old astronomer will not excuse you roared Sir Tiglath
forcibly preventing Mr Sagittarius who was pale as ashes from
escaping into the farther room He will not be run away from by
everybody in this manner

I beg pardon sir I had no intention of running away said Mr
Sagittarius making one last despairing effort to assume his _toga
virilibus_

Then why did you do it sir Tell the old astronomer that cried Sir
Tiglath seizing him by the arm And tell him moreover what you and
the old female Bridgeman have been about together

Nothing sir I swear that Mrs Bridgeman and myself have never

Never made investigations into the possibility of there being oxygen in
many of the holy stars Do you affirm that sir

I do cried Mr Sagittarius I am an outside broker

Do you affirm that you are no astronomer sir Do you declare that you
are not a man of science

I do I do

Not an astronomer of remarkable attainments but very modest and
retiring withal Ohhh

Modest and retiring sir cried Mr Sagittarius suddenly illumined
by a ray of hope Thats just it I am a modest and retiring outside
broker sir

And he violently endeavoured to prove the truth of the words by escaping
forthwith into obscurity

There never was a modest and retiring outside broker bellowed Sir
Tiglath There never was and there never will be The old

Whats that interrupted Mr Sagittarius Whatevers that

For at this moment an extraordinary hum of voices made itself audible
above the fifty guitars and a noise of many feet trampling eagerly upon
Mrs Bridgemans parquet grew louder and louder in the brilliant rooms
Attracted by the uproar Sir Tiglath paused for a moment still keeping
his hand upon the lapel of Mr Ferdinands coat however The noise
increased It was evident that a multitude of people was rapidly
approaching Words uttered by the moving guests exclamations and
ejaculations of excitement now detached themselves from the general
murmur

The Prophet from the Mouse

The great Malkiel here

The founder of the almanac

The greatest Prophet of the age

Malkiel the Second from the Mouse

Where is Malkiel

We must find Malkiel

We must see Malkiel

Is it really Malkiel

Oh is it _the_ Malkiel Wherewhere is Malkiel

Such cries as these broke upon the ears of the astronomer and Mr
Sagittarius

Sir Tiglath grew purple

Malkiel who has insulted the holy stars here he roared letting go of
Mr Sagittarius Wherewhere is he

In there sir I verily believe cried Mr Sagittarius pointing in
the direction of the crowd with a hand that shook like all the leaves in
Vallombrosa

Let me find him shouted the astronomer Let me only discover him
Ill break every bone in his accursed body

And with this rather bald statement he rolled out of the room in one
direction while Mr Sagittarius without more ado cast aside his _toga
virilibus_ and darted out of it into another just as Madame escorted by
Mrs Bridgeman Lady Enid the great Towle and the whole of the company
assembled at Zoological House appeared majesticallyand proceeding as
an Empressin the aperture of the main doorway



CHAPTER XIX

MRS MERILLIA HEATS THE POKER

When Mr Sagittarius running at his fullest speed emerged from
Zoological House wearing the hat and coat that the saturnine little
clergyman had left behind him the night was damp and gusty As he
hastened down the drive and the sound of twenty guitars playing
Oh would I were a Spaniard among you lemon groves died away in the
lighted mansion behind him he heard the roaring of the beasts in the
gardens close by In the wet darkness it sounded peculiarly terrific
He shuddered and holding up Mr Ferdinands trousers with both hands
hurried onward through the mire whither he knew not His only thought
was that all was now discovered and that his life was in danger A
womans vanity had wrecked his future He must hide somewhere for the
night and get away in the morning perhaps on board some tramp steamer
bound for Buenos Ayres or on a junk weighing anchor for Hayti or Java
or some other distant place Vague memories of books he had read when a
boy came back to him as he ran through the unkempt wilds of the Regents
Park He saw himself a stowaway hidden in a hold alone with rats and
ships biscuits He saw himself working his way out before the mast
sent aloft in hurricanes on pitchblack nights or turning the wheel the
wrong way round and bringing the ship to wreck upon ironbound coasts
swarming with sharks and savages The lions roared again and the black
panthers snarled behind their prison bars He thought of the peaceful
waters of the river Mouse of the library of Madame of the happy little
circle of architects and their wives of all that he must leave

What wonder if he dropped a tear into the muddy road What wonder if a
sob rent the bosom of Mr Ferdinands now disordered shirt front On and
on Mr Sagittariusor Malkiel the Second as he may from henceforth
be calledwent blindly on and on till the Park was left behind till
crescents gave way to squares and squares to streets He passed an
occasional policeman and slunk away from the penetrating bullseye
He heard now and then the faroff rattle of a cab the shrill cry of
a whistle the howl of a butler summoning a vehicle the coo of a cook
bidding goodnight to the young tradesman whom she loved before the area
gate And all these familiar London sounds struck strangely on his ear
When would he hear them again Perhaps never He stumbled on blinded
with emotion

Dogs we know are guided by a strange instinct to find their homes even
by unfamiliar paths Pigeons will fly across wide spaces and drop down
to the wicker cage that awaits them And it would appear that prophets
are not without a certain faculty that may be called topographical For
how else can the following fact be explained Malkiel the Second after
apparently endless wandering found himself totally unable to proceed
further His legs gave way beneath him His breath failed His brain
swam He reeled stretched forth his hands and clutched at the nearest
support This chanced to be a railing wet slimy cold He grasped it
leaned against it and for a few moments remained where he was in a sort
of trance Then gradually full consciousness returned He glanced up
and beheld the black garden of a square Somehow it looked familiar He
seemed to know those shadowy leafless trees the roadway between him
and them even the pavement upon which his bootshis own bootswere
set His lacklustre eyes travelled to the houses that bordered the
square then to the house against whose area railings he was leaning
and he started with amazement For he was in Berkeley Square leaning
against the railing of number one thousand He gazed up at the windows
One or two faint lights twinkled Then perhaps the household had not yet
retired for the night An idea seized him He must rest He must snatch
a brief interval of repose before starting for the docks at dawn to
find a ship in whose hold he could seek seclusion till the great seas
roared round her and he could declare himself to the captain and
crew without fear of being put ashore Why not rest here in number one
thousand True the Prophet would presently be returning possibly with
Madame but he would bribe Mr Ferdinand not to mention his whereabouts
It was no doubt a very rash proceeding but he was utterly exhausted
he felt that he could go no further he found himself before an almost
friendly door What wonder then if he tottered up the steps and tapped
feebly upon it There was no answer He tapped again more loudly This
time his summons was heard Steps approached There was a moments
pause Then the door opened and Gustavus appeared looking rather
sleepy but still decidedly intellectual Malkiel the Second pulled
himself together and faced the footman boldly

You know me he said

Gustavus examined him closely

Yes sir he replied at length By the clothes I should know Mr
Ferdinands trouserings among a thousand

Malkiel the Second realised that emotion probably rendered his face
unrecognisable But at least his legs spoke for him That was something
and he continued with an attempt at ease and boldness

Right I have returned to change them

Yes sir Mr Ferdinand has retired to bed sir

Dont wake him I can just leave them for him

Very well sir

And Gustavus admitted Malkiel to the dimlylit hall and shut the door
softly

What is your name young man said Malkiel whispering

Gustavus sir

Ah Gustavus would you like to earn a hundred pounds tonight

Gustavus started

I dont say as how Id rather not sir he replied I dont go so far
as to say that

Right Do as I tell you and you will earn a hundred pounds

The footmans eyes began to glow almost like a cats in the twilight

Why I could buy the library near twelve times over he murmured

The library said Malkiel whose brain had suddenly become strangely
clear

Ah sirDr Carters returned Gustavus beginning to tremble

Dr Carters whispered Malkiel excitedly I should think so Eight
guineas and a half and you pay in instalments

Ill do it sir hissed Gustavus utterly carried away by the
prospect What dyou want me to do

First to let me change my clothes quickly then to hide me somewhere so
as I can get a sleep till dawn Call me directly it begins to get light
and I shall be off to the docks

The docks sir

Ay I start forfor Java tomorrow

Java sirwhat where the sparrows and the jelly

Ay ay returned Malkiel secretly rehearsing his new nautical role

Ill do it sir And the hundred

Ill write you an order on my bankers You can trust me Now let me
change my clothes Quick

Theyre in Mr Vivians bedroom aint they

Malkiel nodded

You must go very soft sir because of the old lady Shes abed but
she might be wakeful specially tonight Shes been awful upset My
word she has

Ill go as soft as a mouse whispered Malkiel Show me the way

Gustavus advanced on tiptoe towards the staircase followed by Malkiel
who held Mr Ferdinands clothes together lest they should rustle and
proceeded with the most infinite precaution In this manner they gained
the second floor and neared the bedroom door of Mrs Merillia Here
Gustavus turned round pointed to the door and put his finger to his
pouting lips at the same time rounding his hazel eyes and shaking
his powdered head in a most warning manner Malkiel nodded held Mr
Ferdinands clothes tighter and stole on as he thought without
making a sound What was his horror then just as he was passing Mrs
Merillias door to hear a voice cry

Hennessey Hennessey

Gustavus and Malkiel stopped dead as if they had both been shot They
now perceived that the door was partially open and that a faint light
shone within the room

Hennessey cried the voice of Mrs Merillia again Come in here I
must speak to you

Gustavus darted on into the darkness of the Prophets room but Malkiel
the Second was so alarmed that he stayed where he was finding himself
totally incapable of movement

Hennessey repeated the voice

Then there was a faint rustling the door was opened more widely and
Mrs Merillia appeared in the aperture clad in a most charming night
bonnet and robed in a dressinggown of white watered silk

The ratcatcher she cried The ratcatcher

Malkiel turned and darted down the stairs while Mrs Merillia in the
extreme of terror shut her door locked it as many times as she could
and then hastened trembling to the bell which communicated with the
faithful Mrs Fancy rang it and dropped half fainting into a chair
Mrs Fancy woke from her second dream just as Malkiel closely followed
by the now shattered Gustavus reached the hall

Hide me Hide me whispered Malkiel In here

And he darted into the servants quarters leaving Gustavus on the
mat Mrs Merillias other bell now pealed shrilly downstairs Gustavus
paused and pulled himself together He was by nature a fairly intrepid
youth and moreover he had recently made a close study of Carlyles
_Heroes and Heroworship_ which greatly impressed him He therefore
resolved in this moment of peril to acquit himself in similar
circumstances and he remounted the stairs and reached Mrs Merillias
door just as Mrs Fancy wrapped in a woollen shawl and wearing a pair
of knitted nightsocks descended to the landing candle in hand

Oh Mr Gustavus said Mrs Fancy Is it the robbers again Is it
murder Mr Gustavus Is it fire

I dont know Mrs Fancy Ill ask the mistress

He tapped upon the door

You cant come in cried poor Mrs Merillia who was losing her head
perhaps for the first time in her life You cant come in and if you
do I shall give you in charge to the police

And she rang both her bells again

Maam said Gustavus knocking once more Maam

Its no use your knocking returned Mrs Merillia The door is
bolted Go away go away

And again she rang her two bells

Madam piped Mrs Fancy Madam Its me

I know said Mrs Merillia I know its you I saw you Leave the
house unless you wish to be at once put in prison

Her bells pealed Mrs Fancy began to sob

Me to leave the house she wailed Me to go to prison

Bear up Mrs Fancy she doesnt know who it is said Gustavus
Maam Maam Missis Missis

I am ringing said Mrs Merillia in a muffled manner through the
door I am summoning assistance You will be captured if you dont go
away

And again she pealed her bells This time as she did so the tingling
of a third bell became audible in the silent house

Lord cried Gustavus if there isnt the hall door It must be
master He left his key tonight Heres a nice go

The three bells raised their piercing chorus Mrs Fancy sobbed and
Gustavus after a terrible moment of hesitation bounded down the hall
His instinct had not played him false The person who had rung the bell
was indeed the Prophet who had basely slunk away from Zoological House
leaving Madame surrounded by her new and adoring friends

Thank you Gustavus he said entering Take my coat please Whats
that

For Mrs Merillias bells struck shrilly upon his astonished ears

I think its Mrs Merillia sir She keeps on ringing

Mrs Merillia At this hour Heavens Is she ill

I dont know sir She keeps ringing but when I answer it she says
Go away she says Go she says sir

How very strange

And the Prophet bounded upstairs and arrived at his grandmothers
door just in time to hear her cry out in reply to poor Mrs Fancys
distracted knocking

If you try to break in you will be put in prison at once I hear
assistance coming I hear the police Go away you wicked wicked man

Grannie cried the Prophet through the keyhole Grannie let me in
Grannie Grannie Dont ring Grannie Grannie

But Mrs Merillia was now completely out of herself and her only
response to her grandsons appeal was to place her trembling fingers
upon the two bells and to reply through their uproar

It is useless for you to say that I know who you are I saw you I
shall go on ringing as long as I can stand I shall die ringing but I
shall never let you in Go away Go away

What does she mean cried the Prophet turning to Gustavus

I dont know indeed sir replied the footman thinking of Mr
Carters library I couldnt say indeed sir

Oh my poor missis wailed Mrs Fancy trembling in her nightsocks
Oh my poor dear missis I cant speak different nor mean other Oh
missis missis

Hush Fancy said the Prophet in the greatest distraction Grannie
Grannie

And seizing the handle of the door he shook it violently Mrs Merillia
was now very naturally under the impression that the ratcatcher was
determined to break in and murder her without more ado Extreme danger
often seems to exercise a strangely calming influence upon the human
soul So it was now Upon hearing her bedroom door quivering under the
assault of the Prophet Mrs Merillia was abruptly invaded by a sort of
desperate courage She left the bells tottered to the grate in which a
good fire was blazing seized the poker and thrust it between the bars
and into the heart of the flames at the same time crying out in a
quavering but determined voice

I am heating the poker If you come in you will repent it I am heating
the poker

On hearing this remark the Prophet desisted from his assault upon the
door overcome by the absolute conviction that his beloved grandmother
was suffering from a pronounced form of homicidal mania His affection
prompted him to keep such a catastrophe secret as long as possible and
he therefore turned to Mrs Fancy and Gustavus and said hurriedly

This is a matter for me alone Mrs Fancy please go away at once
Gustavus you will accompany Mrs Fancy

His manner was so firm his face so iron in its determination that
Mrs Fancy and Gustavus dared not proffer a word They turned away and
disappeared softly down the stairs to wait the _denouement_ of this
tragedy in the hall below Meantime the poker was growing red hot in the
coals and Mrs Merillia announced to the supposed ratcatcher

I can hear youI hear you breathing the Prophet endeavoured not to
breathe I hear you rustling but you cant touch me The poker is red
hot

And she drew it smoking from the grate and approached the door holding
it in her delicate hand like a weapon

Grannie said the Prophet making his voice as much like it generally
was as he possibly could Dearest grannie

I dare you to come in replied Mrs Merillia in an almost formidable
manner I dare you to do it

I am not coming in grannie said the Prophet

Then go away said Mrs Merillia Go awayand let me hear you
going

A sudden idea struck the Prophet He did not say another word but
immediately walked downstairs tramping heavily and shaking the wood
balusters violently at every step he took His ruse succeeded Hearing
the intruder depart Mrs Merillias curious courage deserted her she
dropped the poker into the grate and once more set both bells going
with all her might and main The Prophet let her ring for nearly five
minutes then he bounded once more upstairs and tapped very gently on
the door

Grannie he cried are you ringing What is it

This time Mrs Merillia recognised his voice tottered to the door
unlocked it and fell trembling into his anxious arms

Oh Hennessey she gasped OhHennessey

Grannie what is it What on earth is the matter

The ratcatcher The ratcatcher

The ratcatcher cried the Prophet

He has come back He is here He has been trying to break into my
room

What ratcatcher

The one that dined tonightthe one you called your old andand
valuedfriend

Mr Sagittarius exclaimed the Prophet

He is here

Here

I have seen him He has tried to murder me

I will look into this at once said the Prophet

He ran to the head of the stairs and called out

Gustavus

Sir

Come up here at once

Gustavus came followed closely by Mrs Fancy who was in a state of
abject confusion and alarm

Has Mr Sagittarius returned herethe gentleman who dined tonight
asked the Prophet

Gustavus hesitated thought of Dr Carters library and replied

No sir

Has anybody entered the house

No sir

You have been up the whole evening

Yes sir

And nobody has been

Nobody sir

Grannie you hear what Gustavus says

But Hennessey he is here I saw him

Where

By the door I heard someone and I thought it was you I came to the
door after calling you and there he stood all dirty and wet with
a huge hat on his head the saturnine little clergyman was largely
blessed with brain and a most awful murderous expression on his
face

The Prophet began to suspect that his dear relative upset by the tragic
events of the dinner table had gone to sleep and had the nightmare

Grannie it must have been a dream

No Hennessey no

It must indeed I left Mr Sagittarius at Zoological House I feel
certain of that

The Prophet spoke the honest truth He fully believed that Mr
Sagittarius was at that very moment sharing in the triumph of his wife
and receiving the worship of those who live the silly life

But I saw him Hennessey said Mrs Merillia adding rather
unnecessarily with my own eyes

Grannie darling you must have been dreaming At any rate Im here
now Nothing can hurt you Go to bed Fancy will stay with you and I
swear to you that no harm will happen to you so long as I am breathing

With these noble words the Prophet kissed his grandmother tenderly
assisted Mrs Fancy into the room and walked downstairs quite
determined that come what might whether he broke a thousand oaths or
not he would put an end forthwith to the tyranny of the couple from the
Mouse and abandon for ever the shocking pursuit of prophecy



CHAPTER XX

THE PROPHET RETIRES FROM BUSINESS

Exactly as the Prophet arrived at his resolution the hall door bell
rang violently and Gustavus who had slipped down before the Prophet in
order to seek the traveller to Java in the servants quarters hurried
into the hall in rather a distracted manner

Stop Gustavus said the Prophet

Gustavus stopped The bell rang again

Gustavus said the Prophet if that is a visitor I am not at home
Mrs Merillia is not at home either

It was by this time between one and two in the morning

Not at home sir Yes sir

The Prophet concealed himself near the hatrack and Gustavus went
softly to the door and opened it

Not at home maam the Prophet heard him say formally

What dyou mean young man replied the powerful voice of Madame
Where is my husband

Maam

Where I say is my husband

I couldnt say Im sure maam But Mrs Merillia and Mr Vivian are
not at home

Then all I can say is they ought to be in at this time of night Permit
me to pass Are you aware that Mr Vivian has invited me to spend the
night here _Noctes ambrosianes_

But maam Mr Viv

Thatll do If I have any more of your impertinence Ill make you
repent of it You are evidently not aware who I am

The Prophet by the hatrack did not fail to hear a new note in the
deep contralto of Madame a note of triumph a trumpet note of profound
conceit His heart sank before this determined music and it sank
even lower towards his pumps when a moment later he found himself
confronted by the lady wrapped closely in the rabbitskins and
absolutely bulging with vanity and selfappreciation

What Mr Vivian began the lady

Hush said the Prophet for mercys sakehush

And acting upon the impulse of the moment he suddenly seized Madame by
the hand and hurried her through the swinging door into the servants
hall

Heres a go murmured Gustavus in the greatest trepidation If they
dont find the thin party Im a josser

Meanwhile the Prophet and Madame were standing face to face before the
whatnot of Gustavus

My grandmother is awakethat is asleep said the Prophet We must
not wake her on any account

Oh returned Madame with a toss of her head your grandmother seems
to be a very fidgety old lady Im surealthough you do tell a parcel
of lies about her

Lies said the Prophet with some dignity

Yeslies She dont wear long clothes

I beg your pardon

She do not She dont wear her hair down She dont put her lips to the
bottle She dont Where is Mr Sagiwhere is Malkiel the Second

I have no idea And now Madame I regret that I must conduct you to
your carriage The hour is late my grandmother is seriously indisposed
and I myself need rest

Well then you cant have it retorted the lady with authoritative
spitefulness You cant have it not till three oclock

I beg your pardon said the Prophet with trembling lips

What for

I really regret that I must retire Allow me

Ill not allow you Where is my husband Hes not at the Zoological
Gardens

He has probably returned home

To the Mouse Then hes a coward and an oathbreaker and if Sir
Tiglath was to catch him I shouldnt be sorry Kindly lead me at once
to the telescope I will take his place No one shall say that Madame
Malkiel ever flinched at dutys call _Praesto et persistibus_ Conduct
me at once to the telescope

The telescope cried the Prophet What for

Lawks cried Madame with pronounced temper Did we not journey from
the Mouse apurpose to go practically into the mystery of the dressed
Crab

I reallyI really cannot consent without a chaperon began the
Prophet

The wife of Malkiel the Second needs no chaperone retorted Madame
This night has altered my conditionI stand from henceforth far beyond
the reach of etiquette The world knows me now and will not dare to
carp _Carpe dies_

During the foregoing colloquy her voice had become louder and louder
and the Prophet dreading unspeakably lest his grandmother should be
disturbed and affrighted once more gave up the struggle and without
more ado conducted Madame into the butlers pantry in which the
telescope still remained

Meanwhile what had become of Malkiel the Second

When Mrs Merillia suddenly appeared before him in her nightbonnet and
accused him of being a ratcatcher he had very naturally fled his first
impulse being to leave the house at once and continue his journey to the
docks But even a prophet is but mortal Malkiel had passed through an
eventful day followed by a still more eventful evening His mind was
completely exhausted Even so however he might have continued upon his
journey towards Java had not his legs prosaically shown signs of giving
way under him just as he once more gained the hall This decided him He
must have some short repose at whatever cost He therefore pushed feebly
at the nearest door and found himself promptly in the apartment of the
upper servants Staggering to the whatnot of Gustavus he sank down
upon it and fell into a melancholy reverie from which he was roused
by the constant tingling cry of Mrs Merillias second bell which rang
close to where he was reposing He tried to start up but failed and
it was only when the hall door bell attacked by the Prophet added its
voice to its companions that his terror lent him sufficient strength to
flee very slowly into the inner fastnesses of this unknown region There
was a light in the servants hall but darkness lay beyond and Malkiel
knew not whither he was penetrating He barked his shins but could not
tell against what hard substance He bruised his elbow but could not
know what piece of furniture had assailed it On coming in contact with
a dresser he saw a few sparks but they speedily died out and he was
obliged to feel his way onward till presently he came across a large
leather chair in which Mrs Merillias cook was wont to sit while
directing her subordinates at the basting machine Into this he sank
palpitating and for a moment remained undisturbed Then to his horror
he heard in the adjoining room the strident voice of his loved and
honoured wife apparently carrying on a decidedly vivacious argument with
some person unknown He bounded up Possibly she was accompanied by Sir
Tiglath who must now be aware of his identity In any case her wrath
at his scarcely chivalrous desertion of her in the house of a stranger
would he knew be terrible He dared not face it He dared not allow
his project of flight at dawn to be interfered with as it certainly
would be if he came across Madame He therefore proceeded to flee once
more Nor did he pause until he had gained Mr Ferdinands pantry where
stood the telescope Now in this pantry there was a large cupboard in
which were kept the very numerous and magnificent pieces of plate etc
possessed by Mrs Merillia tall silver candelabra standard lamps
of polished bronze richlychased cups gigantic vases for containing
flowers oriental incense holders upon stands of ebony Spanish charcoal
dishes of burnished brass and other treasures far too numerous to
mention This cupboard was always carefully locked at night but on this
occasion Mr Ferdinand totally disorganised by the frightful scenes
which had taken place at his dinner table during the evening had
retired to bed in a condition of collapse leaving it open Malkiel the
Second feeling frantically about in the dark came upon the door
of this cupboard pulled it found that it yielded to his hand and
hearing the rapidly approaching voices of Madame and the Prophet
stumbled into the cupboard and sank down on a large gold lovingcup
with one foot in a silver soup tureen and the other in a priceless
sugar basin just as the light of the candle borne by the Prophet
glimmered in the darkness of the adjacent corridor

This way Madame said the Prophet But I really think such a
proceeding is calculated to cause a grave scandal in the square

Malkiel the Second drew the cupboard door to and grasped a silver
candelabrum in each hand to sustain himself upon the rather sharp rim of
the lovingcup

What is the square to me or I to the square returned Madame with
ungrammatical majesty Madame Malkiel is not governed by any ordinary
laws _Lexes non scripta_ is her motto To these alone she clings

Her husband clung to the candelabra and burst into a violent
perspiration Through the keyhole of the cupboard a ray of light now
shone and he heard the froufrou of his partners skirt the flump
of the rabbitskins as she cast them from her ample shoulders upon the
floor The Prophets voice became audible again

What do you wish me to do he said with a sort of embittered
courtesy

Throw open the window place yourself before the telescope and proceed
at once to your investigations replied the lady

I am not in a condition to investigate said the Prophet I am not
indeed If you will only let me get you a cab tomorrow night

It is useless to talk Mr Vivian said Madame very sharply The cab
has not yet been made that will convey me to the Mouse tonight

But your husband

My husband is a coward unworthy of such a wife as he possesses At the
crisis of our fortunesWhats that

At this painful moment Malkiel the Second was so overcome by emotion
that he trembled and allowed his left foot to rattle slightly on the
sugar basin

What was it repeated Madame

Rats I have no doubt answered the Prophet who had heard nothing I
believe that the basements of these old houses are simplywellsimply
permeated with rats

For a moment Madame blanched but she was a woman of spirit and
moreover she was almost intoxicated with ambition Recognised at last as
a lady of position and importance in one of the mansions of the idiotic
great she was more anxious than ever to remove forthwith into the
central districts there to exercise that sway which she had so long
desired Finding that there exists a world in which prophetsfar from
being considered as dirty and deceitful personsare worshipped and
adored entertained with Pommery and treated almost as gods she yearned
to dwell in the midst of it The peaceful seclusion of the Mouse was
become hateful to her The architects and their wives began to seem
to her uplifted fancy little better than the circle that frequented
Hagglins Buildings or appeared at the paltry entertainments given by
the inhabitants of Drakemans Villas She was resolved to soar and even
rats should not turn her from her passionate purpose Accordingly she
replied

Rats or no rats I intend to see this matter out _Dixisti_ The night
wanes Kindly go at once to the telescope

The Prophet obeyed first opening the window into the area The rain
had now cleared off but the sky was still rather cloudy and only a few
stars peeped here and there

Really said the Prophet after applying his weary eye to the machine
really I dont think its any good there are so very

Have the goodness to place the old lady in the claws of the Crab
according to the directions of the coward who has deserted me

Malkiel shook with shame upon the lovingcup

But I really cant find the Crab said the Prophet who was so tired
that he could scarcely stand I can see the Great Bear

That is no use The Bear has nothing to do with the old lady You must
find the Crab Look again

The Prophet did so But his eye blinked with fatigue and the heavens
swam before it

There is no Crab tonight he said I assure you on my honour there
is none

Exactly as he finished making this statement a low whistle rang through
the silence of the night The Prophet started Madame jumped and
Malkiel bounded on the lovingcup

The whistle was repeated

Its the thing whispered the Prophet

What thing inquired Madame who had become rather pale

The dark thing that told me the Crab was dressed It has come again

My word ejaculated Madame looking uneasily around Where is it

Just then Malkiel the Seconds feet once more began to tremble among the
plate of Mrs Merillia

You hear it said the Prophet much impressed

Did it rattle like that the other night gasped Madame seizing the
Prophet by the arm

The Prophet told a lie with his head

Address it I beg said Madame in a great state of excitement
Meanwhile I will retire a few paces

So saying she backed into the passage bearing the candle with her
for company and leaving the Prophet in total darkness The low whistle
sounded again and a husky voice said

Are you there

Yes replied the Prophet summoning all his courage I am

What a you put out the light for said the voice which seemed to
come from far away

I havent put it out returned the Prophet Its gone away

At this juncture Malkiel impelled by curiosity ceased from trembling
and leaning forward upon the lovingcup glued his ear to the keyhole
of the cupboard

Why was you so late tonight proceeded the voice Shes been in a
rare taking I can tell you

Who

Who You know well enough

Do you mean my grandmother

Your grandmother ejaculated the voice with apparent sarcasm Ah of
course what do you think

Im sure I dont know said the poor Prophet whose reason was
beginning to totter upon its throne

Well proceeded the voice she thought youd give it up

Whatmy grandmother did

Ah your grandmother Get away with you Ha ha ha

And the mysterious visitant broke forth into a peal of rather mundane
laughter After indulging in this unseemly mirth for about a minute and
a half the personage resumed

The Crab did for her

Upon hearing the mystic word Madame crept stealthily a pace or two
nearer to the door while the Prophet exclaimed

The dressed Crab

Ah what do _you_ think Not a wink of sleep and thought every minuted
be er next

Good Heavens

She says shed never go near a crab again not if its ever so

You are sure said the Prophet eagerly You are positive she said
that

Id stake my Davy and I wouldnt do that on everything There aint
a man living asll ever get her to go within fifty miles of a crab this
side of Judgment

At this point in the colloquy the curiosity of Madame overcame her and
she protruded her head suddenly beyond the edge of the doorway

Ulloh exclaimed the voice Why whats a you got there

Madame hastily withdrew and the voice continued

Blessed if it aint a female

I beg your pardon said the Prophet trembling with propriety
IIthere is no female here

Yes there is cried the voice with a chuckle Theres a female
creeping and crawling about behind that there door

The Prophets sense of chivalry was now fully aroused

You are mistaken he said firmly There are no females creeping
andand crawling about in thisthis respectable house

Respectable ejaculated the voice respectable I say there is a
female Youre a nice one you are Pon my word Ive a good mind to
run you in for Mormonism I have Wherevers she got to

On the last words a sudden blaze of light shot into the pantry and at
the same moment there was the sound of wheels rapidly approaching in the
square

Hulloh said the voice someone acomin

The light died out as rapidly as it had flashed in the wheels drew
close and stopped and a bell pealed forth in the silent house

Merciful Heavens cried the Prophet pressing his hands to his
throbbing brow Merciful Heavens who can that be

There was no answer and the bell pealed again

Grannie will be disturbed exclaimed the Prophet addressing himself
passionately to the darkness Grannie will be killed by all this
uproar

The bell pealed again

This must cease cried the Prophet This must and shall cease I will
bring it all to an end once and for ever

And with sudden desperate decision he shut the window burst out of
the pantry and came upon Madame who was standing in a somewhat furtive
manner by the door that opened into the cellars of the mansion

Mr Vivian she began in a rather subdued voice that isnt a comet
thats a copper

The bell rang again

Dyou thinkdyou think that can be my husband continued Madame
still seeming subdued I should like himDo you think its him

What

The bell

I will very soon see replied the Prophet in a most determined
manner

But Mr Viv

Dont hold me if you please Kindly let me pass

And breaking from the ladys anxious grasp the Prophet rushed into
the hall just as Gustavus appeared descending the front stairs from
the landing before Mrs Merillias door where he had been in close
conference with Mrs Fancy

Stand back Gustavus said the Prophet

Sir

Stand back

But sir there is someone

I know there is I am about to answer the door myself

If you please sir Mrs Merillia is greatly alarmed by the constant
ringing and Mrs Fancy thinks

Gustavus said the Prophet in an awful voice you may retire but
first let me tell you one thing

Certainly sir said the footman beginning to tremble

The circumstances that have rendered a hitherto peaceful household more
disordered than an abode of madmen are about to be brought to an end for
ever There is a point at which a gentleman must either cease to be a
gentleman or cease to be a man I have reached that point Gustavus and
I am about to cease to be a gentleman

And with this terrible statement the Prophet advanced with a sort of
appalling deliberation and threw the front door wide open

Upon the doorstep stood Lady Enid wrapped in a pink opera cloak and Sir
Tiglath Butt shrouded in the Inverness The Prophet faced them with a
marble demeanour

I thought youd be here Mr Vivian began Lady Enid in a bright
manner

I am here said the Prophet speaking in a voice that might well have
issued from a statue

Where is he roared Sir Tiglath Where is he Ohhhh

Sir Tiglath means Malkiel explained Lady Enid He is most anxious to
meet him

Why said the Prophet still in the same inhuman voice

Well we shall see when they do meet said Lady Enid throwing a look
of keen curiosity at the astronomer I rather think here she lowered
her voice and whispered in the Prophets earI rather think Sir
Tiglath wishes to try if he can murder Malkiel Do you believe he could
bring it off

Im sure I dont know answered the Prophet with stony indifference
Goodnight to you

But we want to come in cried Lady Enid

Young man roared Sir Tiglath the old astronomer will not leave this
house till he has searched it from attic to cellar

I am sorry replied the Prophet but I cannot permit my grandmothers
servants or wine to be disturbed at such an hour If you wish to murder
Malkiel the Second I shall not prevent you but he is not here

Then where is he cried Lady Enid

I dont know And now

The Prophet stepped back into the hall and was about to close the door
unceremoniouslyhaving as he intended ceased to be a gentlemanwhen
Lady Enid caught sight of the round and fixed eyes of Gustavus glaring
out into the night from behind his master The appalling feminine
instinct which makes woman the mistress of creation suddenly woke
within her and she cried out in a piercing voice

Malkiels in the house and Gustavus knows it

She spoke these words with such conviction that the Prophet spun round
topwise and stared at the unfortunate flunkey who instantly fell upon
his kneebreeches and stammered out

Oh sir forgive me Its Dr Carter done it sir it is indeed Its
Dr Carter done it

Dr Carter ejaculated the Prophet

The library sir He offered me the library eight times over sir

Who offered you the library

The gent sir in Mr Ferdinands trouserings what was at dinner sir
He only wanted to change em sir and he says to me he says Let me
he says but remove these trouserings he says before I make off to
Java he says

To where roared Sir Tiglath

To Java sir where the jelly and the sparrows is manufactured sir
that is born sir And he says here is a hundred pounds he says

Then he is in the house said the Prophet sternly

Well sir he was sir And as I aint seen him go sir I expect as
hes somewhere about changing of em sir Oh sir if youll only look
it over sir Its all the thirst sir its all the thirst

What You have been drinking cried the Prophet in an outraged
manner

No sir the thirst for knowledge sir as has brought me to this Oh
sir if only youll

Hush said the Prophet fiercely Sir Tiglath he added turning
towards the puffing astronomer you can enter My grandmother must have
been right

Your grandmother said Lady Enid with eager inquisitiveness

She informed me that the ruffian was in the house and had attempted to
make away with her

Dear me this is most interesting interposed Lady Enid

But I supposed she had had the nightmare It seems that I was wrong If
you will step in you can search the house at once And if you
discover this nameless creature changing histhat is Mr Ferdinands
trouseringstrousers that isin any part of the building as far as
I am concerned you can murder him forthwith

The Prophet spoke quite calmly in a soft and level voice Yet there
was something so frightful in his tone and manner that even Sir Tiglath
seemed slightly awestricken At any rate he accepted the Prophets
invitation in silence and stepped almost furtively into the hall on
whose floor Gustavus was still posed in the conventional attitude of the
Christian martyr Lady Enid eagerly followed and the Prophet was just
about to close the door when a dark hovering figure that was pausing
at a short distance off upon the pavement attracted his attention He
stopped short and perceiving that it was a policeman beckoned to it
The figure approached

Whats up now it said familiarly emphasising the question with
a sharp contraction of the left eyelid Youre having a nice game
tonight and no mistake

Game replied the Prophet sternly This is no game Stand there by
the area gate and if anyone should run out knock him down with your
truncheon Do you hear me

With these impressive words he entered the house and shut the door
leaving the policeman to whistle inquiringly to the stars that were
watching over this house once peaceful but now the abode of violence
and tragedy

In the hall he found Gustavus still on his knees between Lady Enid and
Sir Tiglath

Lady Enid he said even in this hour mindful of the proprieties you
have heard what this villain is doing here and must be sensible that
you can take no part in this search

Oh but I particularly want began Lady Enid hastily

Pardon me said the Prophet with more firmness than Napoleon ever
showed to his marshals You must retire Please come this way Mrs
Fancy will look after you

Oh but really Mr Vivian I

Kindly follow me

Lady Enid hesitated for a moment but the Prophets manner was too much
for her and when he stepped like a clockwork automaton with a steel
interior towards the staircase she crept mildly in his wake

Cant I really she whispered in his ear

Certainly not If you were a married woman possibly

Well but I am engaged she murmured

The Prophet stopped short

Engaged he said To whom

Sir Tiglath

Engaged to Sir Tiglath

Yes He proposed to me tonight at Zoological House

Why

She might well have resented the question but perhaps she divined the
distraught and almost maniacal condition of mind that the Prophet masked
beneath his impassive demeanour At any rate she answered frankly

Because he didnt find out Im Miss Minerva and in the midst of Mrs
Bridgemans silly world I stood right out as the only sensible creature
living Isnt it fun

Fun

Yes I always meant him to propose to me

Why

Because I always thought it would be supremely idiotic of me to accept
him

The Prophet felt that if he listened to another remark of such a nature
his brain would snap and he would instantly be taken with a tearing fit
of hysterics He therefore turned round and slowly ascended to the first
floor

Kindly step into the drawingroom he said having first by a rapid
glance assured himself that Malkiel was not changing Mr Ferdinands
trousers there I will send Mrs Fancy to chaperon you

Lady Enid stepped in obediently and the Prophet who could distinctly
hear Mrs Fancy sobbing on the landing above proceeded thither took
her hand and guided her down to the drawingroom

Oh my poor poor missis gulped the devoted creature Oh my

Precisely rejoined the Prophet with passionless equanimity Please
go in there and remain to guard this young lady

He assisted Mrs Fancy to fall in a heap upon the nearest sociable and
then still moving with a species of frozen deliberation betook himself
once more to the hall The astronomer and Gustavus were standing there
in silence

Sir Tiglath said the Prophet in a very formal manner you can now
begin to search for this ruffian

Sir Tiglath cleared his throat and continued to stand still

I hope you will find him continued the Prophet

Sir Tiglath cleared his throat again and added

Why

Why Because I think it quite time that he was murdered answered the
Prophet unemotionally Well why dont you search

The astronomer whose face began to look less red than usual rolled
his glassy eyes round upon the shadowy hall the dim staircase and the
gloomylooking closed doors that confronted them

Where is the old astronomer to search he asked in a low voice
Ohhhh

The final exclamation sounded remarkably tremulous

Anywhereexcept in my grandmothers bedroom That of course is sacred
Well why dont you begin

Sir Tiglath eyed the Prophet furtively

ImIm going to he murmured hoarsely The old astronomer does not
know the meaning of the wordfear

Exactly as he uttered these inspiring words the hall clock growled like
a very large dog and struck two Sir Tiglath started and caught hold
of Gustavus who started in his turn and shrank away The Prophet alone
stood up to the clock which finished its remark with a click and
resumed its habitual occupation of ticking

Pray begin Sir Tiglath said the Prophet

The old astronomermust have aaacandle

Here is one said the Prophet handing the desired article

A lighted candle

Why lighted Oh so that you can see to murder him Gustavus light the
candle

Gustavus who was trembling a good deal more than an autumn leaf
complied after about fifteen unavailing attempts

There Sir Tiglath said the Prophet Now you can begin And he
seated himself upon a settee leaned back and crossed his legs

You will not accompany the old astronomer Ohhh

No I will rest here When you have found the ruffian and murdered him
I shall be glad to hear your news

And so saying the Prophet settled himself comfortably with a cushion
behind his back and calmly closed his eyes The candlestick clattered
in Sir Tiglaths gouty hand The Prophet heard it heard heavy feet
shuffling very slowly and cautiously over the floor of the hall finally
heard the door leading to the servants quarters swing on its hinges
Still he did not open his eyes He felt that if he were to do so just
then he would probably begin to shriek rave foam at the mouth and
in all known ways comport himself as do the inhabitants of Bedlam A
delicate silence fell in the hall How long it lasted the Prophet never
knew It might have been five minutes or five years as far as he
was concerned It was broken at length by the following symphony of
soundsan elderly mans voice roaring a womans voice uttering a
considerable number of very powerful screams on a rather low but
still resounding note a loud thump a crash of glass a prodigious
clattering as of utensils made in some noisy material falling from a
height and rolling vigorously in innumerable directions two or three
bangs of doors and the peculiar patter of rather large and flat feet
unaccustomed to any rapid exercise moving over boards oilcloth and
carpet Then the swing door sang and the Prophet opening his eyes
perceived Madame Malkiel moving forward with considerable vivacity
and screaming as she moved her bonnet depending down her back and the
rabbitskins flowing from her ample shoulders Immediately behind her
ran her spouse holding in one hand a silver pepper castor and in the
other a small and very beautifully finished bronze teapot of the William
of Orange period The worthy couple fleeted by and the Prophet turned
his expressionless eyes towards the swing door expecting immediately
to perceive Sir Tiglath Butt in valiant pursuit As no such figure
presented itself and as the Malkiels were now beginning to mount
the stairs with continually increasing velocity the Prophet slowly
uncrossed his legs and was thinking of getting upon his feet when there
came a loud knock upon the hall door

Gustavus said the Prophet glancing round

He perceived the footman lying in a dead faint near the umbrella stand

Oh he said speaking to himself aloud Oh Then I must go myself

Acting upon his conception of his duty he accordingly walked to the
front door opened it and found the policeman outside supporting the
senseless form of Sir Tiglath Butt in one hand and holding a broken
truncheon in the other

Well said the Prophet calmly Well

I knocked him down as he was making a bolt said the policeman

The Prophet found himself wondering why so industrious and even useful
an occupation should be interfered with in such a manner However he
only replied

Indeed

Ah said the policeman stepping into the hall and laying the
astronomer out across a chair whats up

They are both up answered the Prophet pointing with a lethargic
finger towards the staircase from which at this moment arose a
perfect hubbub of voices

Come on cried the policeman

Why asked the Prophet

Why youre a nice un you are Why And nab em of course

You think it would be wise towhat was the wordnab them inquired
the Prophet You really think so

Well what am I here for then said the policeman with angry irony

Oh if you prefer rejoined the Prophet civilly Nab them by all
means I shall not prevent you

The policeman who was an active and industrious fellow deserving of
praise waited for no further permission but immediately darted up the
stairs and in less than a minute returned with Mrs Merilliaattired
in a black silk gown a bonnet and an Indian shawl presented to her on
her marriage by a very great personagein close custody

Heres one of em he shouted Here you lay hold of her while I
fetch the rest

And with these words he thrust the Prophets grandmother into one of his
hands the broken truncheon into the other and turning smartly round
again bounded up the stairs

In a famous poem of the late Lord Tennyson there is related a dramatic
incident of a lady whose disinclination to cry when such emotion would
have been only natural was overcome by the presentation to her of her
child A somewhat similar effect was produced upon our Prophet by the
constables presentation to him of his honoured grandmother The sight
of her reverent head surmounted by the bonnet which she had assumed in
readiness to flee from the house which she could no longer regard as
a homethe touch of her delicate handthe flutter of her so hallowed
Indian shawlthese things broke down the strange calm of her devoted
grandson Like summer tempest came his emotion and when the policeman
presently returned with Malkiel the Second and Madame nabbed by his
right and left hands and followed by Lady Enid and the weeping Mrs
Fancy he was confronted by a most pathetic tableau The Prophet and
Mrs Merillia were weeping in each others arms while Sir Tiglath and
Gustavusjust returned to consciousnesswere engaged in examining the
proceeding with puppy dogs eyes

Over the explanations that ensued a veil may be partially drawn One
lifted corner however allows us to note that Sir Tiglath Butt having
come upon Madame hidden behind a bin of old port in the Prophets
cellar had been seized by a desire not to alarm a lady so profound that
it prompted him to hurry to the butlers pantry and to seek concealment
in the very cupboard which already contained Malkiel the Second On
perceiving that gentleman perched upon the lovingcup and protected by
candlesticks sugar basins teapots and other weapons the astronomers
anxiety to become a murderer apparently forsook him At any rate he
passed through the plateglass of the window rather hastily into the
area where as we know he received the solicitous attentions of
the policeman who had served as an intermediary between the Lord
Chancellors second cookwhose supper of dressed crab had caused so
much confusionand the supposed Mr Ferdinand Malkiel the Second
finding himself discovered took to the open just as Madame fled forth
from the cellar to be overtaken by the very natural misconception that
she was about to become the victim of a husband whose jealousy had at
length caused him to assume his _toga virilibus_

Perhaps it was Sir Tiglaths throwing off of the said garment which
caused Lady Enid to throw him over At any rate she eventually married
Mr Robert Green and made him a very sensible wife

The Malkiels returned to the Mouse where they still live and still
carry on a certain amount of intercourse with architects and their
wives From time to time however they attend the receptions at
Zoological House and a rumour recently ran through the circles of the
silly to the effect that they had been looking at a house not far from
the Earls Court Station with a viewit is surmisedof removing to
more central districts

They are no longer on terms with the Prophet

He has retired from business and put down his telescope once and for
all recognising that prophecy is a dangerous employment and one likely
to bring about the very evils it foreshadows Calmly he dwells with his
beloved grandmother in the Berkeley Square which has received them once
more into its former favour Sometimes at night when the sky is
clear and the bright stars the guardian stars keep watch over
his aristocratic neighbourhood he draws aside the curtain from the
drawingroom window and glances forth at Mercury and Uranus Jupiter
Saturn and Venus And when his eyes meet their twinkling eyes he
exchanges with themnot a question and answer not a demand for
unholy information and a reluctant reply but a serene gentlemanly and
perfectly decorous goodnight
