His Last Bow

An Epilogue of Sherlock Holmes


By

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle


Part of a collection of stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle published as
a book entitled His Last Bow




It was nine oclock at night upon the second of Augustthe most
terrible August in the history of the world One might have thought
already that Gods curse hung heavy over a degenerate world for there
was an awesome hush and a feeling of vague expectancy in the sultry and
stagnant air The sun had long set but one bloodred gash like an
open wound lay low in the distant west Above the stars were shining
brightly and below the lights of the shipping glimmered in the bay
The two famous Germans stood beside the stone parapet of the garden
walk with the long low heavily gabled house behind them and they
looked down upon the broad sweep of the beach at the foot of the great
chalk cliff in which Von Bork like some wandering eagle had perched
himself four years before They stood with their heads close together
talking in low confidential tones From below the two glowing ends of
their cigars might have been the smouldering eyes of some malignant
fiend looking down in the darkness

A remarkable man this Von Borka man who could hardly be matched among
all the devoted agents of the Kaiser It was his talents which had
first recommended him for the English mission the most important
mission of all but since he had taken it over those talents had become
more and more manifest to the halfdozen people in the world who were
really in touch with the truth One of these was his present
companion Baron Von Herling the chief secretary of the legation
whose huge 100horsepower Benz car was blocking the country lane as it
waited to waft its owner back to London

So far as I can judge the trend of events you will probably be back
in Berlin within the week the secretary was saying When you get
there my dear Von Bork I think you will be surprised at the welcome
you will receive I happen to know what is thought in the highest
quarters of your work in this country He was a huge man the
secretary deep broad and tall with a slow heavy fashion of speech
which had been his main asset in his political career

Von Bork laughed

They are not very hard to deceive he remarked A more docile
simple folk could not be imagined

I dont know about that said the other thoughtfully They have
strange limits and one must learn to observe them It is that surface
simplicity of theirs which makes a trap for the stranger Ones first
impression is that they are entirely soft Then one comes suddenly upon
something very hard and you know that you have reached the limit and
must adapt yourself to the fact They have for example their insular
conventions which simply MUST be observed

Meaning good form and that sort of thing Von Bork sighed as one
who had suffered much

Meaning British prejudice in all its queer manifestations As an
example I may quote one of my own worst blundersI can afford to talk
of my blunders for you know my work well enough to be aware of my
successes It was on my first arrival I was invited to a weekend
gathering at the country house of a cabinet minister The conversation
was amazingly indiscreet

Von Bork nodded Ive been there said he dryly

Exactly Well I naturally sent a resume of the information to
Berlin Unfortunately our good chancellor is a little heavyhanded in
these matters and he transmitted a remark which showed that he was
aware of what had been said This of course took the trail straight
up to me Youve no idea the harm that it did me There was nothing
soft about our British hosts on that occasion I can assure you I was
two years living it down Now you with this sporting pose of yours

No no dont call it a pose A pose is an artificial thing This is
quite natural I am a born sportsman I enjoy it

Well that makes it the more effective You yacht against them you
hunt with them you play polo you match them in every game your
fourinhand takes the prize at Olympia I have even heard that you go
the length of boxing with the young officers What is the result
Nobody takes you seriously You are a good old sport quite a decent
fellow for a German a harddrinking nightclub knockabouttown
devilmaycare young fellow And all the time this quiet country house
of yours is the centre of half the mischief in England and the
sporting squire the most astute secretservice man in Europe Genius
my dear Von Borkgenius

You flatter me Baron But certainly I may claim my four years in
this country have not been unproductive Ive never shown you my
little store Would you mind stepping in for a moment

The door of the study opened straight on to the terrace Von Bork
pushed it back and leading the way he clicked the switch of the
electric light He then closed the door behind the bulky form which
followed him and carefully adjusted the heavy curtain over the latticed
window Only when all these precautions had been taken and tested did
he turn his sunburned aquiline face to his guest

Some of my papers have gone said he When my wife and the
household left yesterday for Flushing they took the less important with
them I must of course claim the protection of the embassy for the
others

Your name has already been filed as one of the personal suite There
will be no difficulties for you or your baggage Of course it is just
possible that we may not have to go England may leave France to her
fate We are sure that there is no binding treaty between them

And Belgium

Yes and Belgium too

Von Bork shook his head I dont see how that could be There is a
definite treaty there She could never recover from such a
humiliation

She would at least have peace for the moment

But her honor

Tut my dear sir we live in a utilitarian age Honour is a mediaeval
conception Besides England is not ready It is an inconceivable
thing but even our special war tax of fifty million which one would
think made our purpose as clear as if we had advertised it on the front
page of the Times has not roused these people from their slumbers
Here and there one hears a question It is my business to find an
answer Here and there also there is an irritation It is my business
to soothe it But I can assure you that so far as the essentials
gothe storage of munitions the preparation for submarine attack the
arrangements for making high explosivesnothing is prepared How
then can England come in especially when we have stirred her up such a
devils brew of Irish civil war windowbreaking Furies and God knows
what to keep her thoughts at home

She must think of her future

Ah that is another matter I fancy that in the future we have our
own very definite plans about England and that your information will
be very vital to us It is today or tomorrow with Mr John Bull If
he prefers today we are perfectly ready If it is tomorrow we shall
be more ready still I should think they would be wiser to fight with
allies than without them but that is their own affair This week is
their week of destiny But you were speaking of your papers He sat
in the armchair with the light shining upon his broad bald head while
he puffed sedately at his cigar

The large oakpanelled booklined room had a curtain hung in the
further corner When this was drawn it disclosed a large brassbound
safe Von Bork detached a small key from his watch chain and after
some considerable manipulation of the lock he swung open the heavy door

Look said he standing clear with a wave of his hand

The light shone vividly into the opened safe and the secretary of the
embassy gazed with an absorbed interest at the rows of stuffed
pigeonholes with which it was furnished Each pigeonhole had its
label and his eyes as he glanced along them read a long series of such
titles as Fords Harbourdefences Aeroplanes Ireland
Egypt Portsmouth forts The Channel Rosythe and a score of
others Each compartment was bristling with papers and plans

Colossal said the secretary Putting down his cigar he softly
clapped his fat hands

And all in four years Baron Not such a bad show for the
harddrinking hardriding country squire But the gem of my
collection is coming and there is the setting all ready for it He
pointed to a space over which Naval Signals was printed

But you have a good dossier there already

Out of date and waste paper The Admiralty in some way got the alarm
and every code has been changed It was a blow Baronthe worst
setback in my whole campaign But thanks to my checkbook and the good
Altamont all will be well tonight

The Baron looked at his watch and gave a guttural exclamation of
disappointment

Well I really can wait no longer You can imagine that things are
moving at present in Carlton Terrace and that we have all to be at our
posts I had hoped to be able to bring news of your great coup Did
Altamont name no hour

Von Bork pushed over a telegram

Will come without fail tonight and bring new sparking plugs

Altamont

Sparking plugs eh

You see he poses as a motor expert and I keep a full garage In our
code everything likely to come up is named after some spare part If
he talks of a radiator it is a battleship of an oil pump a cruiser
and so on Sparking plugs are naval signals

From Portsmouth at midday said the secretary examining the
superscription By the way what do you give him

Five hundred pounds for this particular job Of course he has a
salary as well

The greedy rogue They are useful these traitors but I grudge them
their blood money

I grudge Altamont nothing He is a wonderful worker If I pay him
well at least he delivers the goods to use his own phrase Besides he
is not a traitor I assure you that our most panGermanic Junker is a
sucking dove in his feelings towards England as compared with a real
bitter IrishAmerican

Oh an IrishAmerican

If you heard him talk you would not doubt it Sometimes I assure you
I can hardly understand him He seems to have declared war on the
Kings English as well as on the English king Must you really go He
may be here any moment

No Im sorry but I have already overstayed my time We shall
expect you early tomorrow and when you get that signal book through
the little door on the Duke of Yorks steps you can put a triumphant
Finis to your record in England What Tokay He indicated a
heavily sealed dustcovered bottle which stood with two high glasses
upon a salver

May I offer you a glass before your journey

No thanks But it looks like revelry

Altamont has a nice taste in wines and he took a fancy to my Tokay
He is a touchy fellow and needs humouring in small things I have to
study him I assure you They had strolled out on to the terrace
again and along it to the further end where at a touch from the
Barons chauffeur the great car shivered and chuckled Those are the
lights of Harwich I suppose said the secretary pulling on his dust
coat How still and peaceful it all seems There may be other lights
within the week and the English coast a less tranquil place The
heavens too may not be quite so peaceful if all that the good Zepplin
promises us comes true By the way who is that

Only one window showed a light behind them in it there stood a lamp
and beside it seated at a table was a dear old ruddyfaced woman in a
country cap She was bending over her knitting and stopping
occasionally to stroke a large black cat upon a stool beside her

That is Martha the only servant I have left

The secretary chuckled

She might almost personify Britannia said he with her complete
selfabsorption and general air of comfortable somnolence Well au
revoir Von Bork With a final wave of his hand he sprang into the
car and a moment later the two golden cones from the headlights shot
through the darkness The secretary lay back in the cushions of the
luxurious limousine with his thoughts so full of the impending
European tragedy that he hardly observed that as his car swung round
the village street it nearly passed over a little Ford coming in the
opposite direction

Von Bork walked slowly back to the study when the last gleams of the
motor lamps had faded into the distance As he passed he observed that
his old housekeeper had put out her lamp and retired It was a new
experience to him the silence and darkness of his widespread house
for his family and household had been a large one It was a relief to
him however to think that they were all in safety and that but for
that one old woman who had lingered in the kitchen he had the whole
place to himself There was a good deal of tidying up to do inside his
study and he set himself to do it until his keen handsome face was
flushed with the heat of the burning papers A leather valise stood
beside his table and into this he began to pack very neatly and
systematically the precious contents of his safe He had hardly got
started with the work however when his quick ears caught the sounds
of a distant car Instantly he gave an exclamation of satisfaction
strapped up the valise shut the safe locked it and hurried out on to
the terrace He was just in time to see the lights of a small car come
to a halt at the gate A passenger sprang out of it and advanced
swiftly towards him while the chauffeur a heavily built elderly man
with a gray moustache settled down like one who resigns himself to a
long vigil

Well asked Von Bork eagerly running forward to meet his visitor

For answer the man waved a small brownpaper parcel triumphantly above
his head

You can give me the glad hand tonight mister he cried Im
bringing home the bacon at last

The signals

Same as I said in my cable Every last one of them semaphore lamp
code Marconia copy mind you not the original That was too
dangerous But its the real goods and you can lay to that He
slapped the German upon the shoulder with a rough familiarity from
which the other winced

Come in he said Im all alone in the house I was only waiting
for this Of course a copy is better than the original If an original
were missing they would change the whole thing You think its all safe
about the copy

The IrishAmerican had entered the study and stretched his long limbs
from the armchair He was a tall gaunt man of sixty with clearcut
features and a small goatee beard which gave him a general resemblance
to the caricatures of Uncle Sam A halfsmoked sodden cigar hung from
the corner of his mouth and as he sat down he struck a match and relit
it Making ready for a move he remarked as he looked round him
Say mister he added as his eyes fell upon the safe from which the
curtain was now removed you dont tell me you keep your papers in
that

Why not

Gosh in a wideopen contraption like that And they reckon you to be
some spy Why a Yankee crook would be into that with a canopener
If Id known that any letter of mine was goin to lie loose in a thing
like that Id have been a mug to write to you at all

It would puzzle any crook to force that safe Von Bork answered
You wont cut that metal with any tool

But the lock

No its a double combination lock You know what that is

Search me said the American

Well you need a word as well as a set of figures before you can get
the lock to work He rose and showed a doubleradiating disc round
the keyhole This outer one is for the letters the inner one for the
figures

Well well thats fine

So its not quite as simple as you thought It was four years ago
that I had it made and what do you think I chose for the word and
figures

Its beyond me

Well I chose August for the word and 1914 for the figures and here
we are

The Americans face showed his surprise and admiration

My but that was smart You had it down to a fine thing

Yes a few of us even then could have guessed the date Here it is
and Im shutting down tomorrow morning

Well I guess youll have to fix me up also Im not staying in this
goldarned country all on my lonesome In a week or less from what I
see John Bull will be on his hind legs and fair ramping Id rather
watch him from over the water

But youre an American citizen

Well so was Jack James an American citizen but hes doing time in
Portland all the same It cuts no ice with a British copper to tell
him youre an American citizen Its British law and order over
here says he By the way mister talking of Jack James it seems to
me you dont do much to cover your men

What do you mean Von Bork asked sharply

Well you are their employer aint you Its up to you to see that
they dont fall down But they do fall down and when did you ever
pick them up Theres James

It was Jamess own fault You know that yourself He was too
selfwilled for the job

James was a boneheadI give you that Then there was Hollis

The man was mad

Well he went a bit woozy towards the end Its enough to make a man
bughouse when he has to play a part from morning to night with a
hundred guys all ready to set the coppers wise to him But now there is
Steiner

Von Bork started violently and his ruddy face turned a shade paler

What about Steiner

Well theyve got him thats all They raided his store last night
and he and his papers are all in Portsmouth jail Youll go off and
he poor devil will have to stand the racket and lucky if he gets off
with his life Thats why I want to get over the water as soon as you
do

Von Bork was a strong selfcontained man but it was easy to see that
the news had shaken him

How could they have got on to Steiner he muttered Thats the
worst blow yet

Well you nearly had a worse one for I believe they are not far off
me

You dont mean that

Sure thing My landlady down Fratton way had some inquiries and when
I heard of it I guessed it was time for me to hustle But what I want
to know mister is how the coppers know these things Steiner is the
fifth man youve lost since I signed on with you and I know the name
of the sixth if I dont get a move on How do you explain it and
aint you ashamed to see your men go down like this

Von Bork flushed crimson

How dare you speak in such a way

If I didnt dare things mister I wouldnt be in your service But
Ill tell you straight what is in my mind Ive heard that with you
German politicians when an agent has done his work you are not sorry to
see him put away

Von Bork sprang to his feet

Do you dare to suggest that I have given away my own agents

I dont stand for that mister but theres a stool pigeon or a cross
somewhere and its up to you to find out where it is Anyhow I am
taking no more chances Its me for little Holland and the sooner the
better

Von Bork had mastered his anger

We have been allies too long to quarrel now at the very hour of
victory he said Youve done splendid work and taken risks and I
cant forget it By all means go to Holland and you can get a boat
from Rotterdam to New York No other line will be safe a week from
now Ill take that book and pack it with the rest

The American held the small parcel in his hand but made no motion to
give it up

What about the dough he asked

The what

The boodle The reward The 500 pounds The gunner turned damned
nasty at the last and I had to square him with an extra hundred
dollars or it would have been nitsky for you and me Nothin doin
says he and he meant it too but the last hundred did it Its cost
me two hundred pound from first to last so it isnt likely Id give it
up without gettin my wad

Von Bork smiled with some bitterness You dont seem to have a very
high opinion of my honour said he you want the money before you
give up the book

Well mister it is a business proposition

All right Have your way He sat down at the table and scribbled a
check which he tore from the book but he refrained from handing it to
his companion After all since we are to be on such terms Mr
Altamont said he I dont see why I should trust you any more than
you trust me Do you understand he added looking back over his
shoulder at the American Theres the check upon the table I claim
the right to examine that parcel before you pick the money up

The American passed it over without a word Von Bork undid a winding
of string and two wrappers of paper Then he sat gazing for a moment
in silent amazement at a small blue book which lay before him Across
the cover was printed in golden letters Practical Handbook of Bee
Culture Only for one instant did the master spy glare at this
strangely irrelevant inscription The next he was gripped at the back
of his neck by a grasp of iron and a chloroformed sponge was held in
front of his writhing face

Another glass Watson said Mr Sherlock Holmes as he extended the
bottle of Imperial Tokay

The thickset chauffeur who had seated himself by the table pushed
forward his glass with some eagerness

It is a good wine Holmes

A remarkable wine Watson Our friend upon the sofa has assured me
that it is from Franz Josefs special cellar at the Schoenbrunn Palace
Might I trouble you to open the window for chloroform vapour does not
help the palate

The safe was ajar and Holmes standing in front of it was removing
dossier after dossier swiftly examining each and then packing it
neatly in Von Borks valise The German lay upon the sofa sleeping
stertorously with a strap round his upper arms and another round his
legs

We need not hurry ourselves Watson We are safe from interruption
Would you mind touching the bell There is no one in the house except
old Martha who has played her part to admiration I got her the
situation here when first I took the matter up Ah Martha you will be
glad to hear that all is well

The pleasant old lady had appeared in the doorway She curtseyed with
a smile to Mr Holmes but glanced with some apprehension at the figure
upon the sofa

It is all right Martha He has not been hurt at all

I am glad of that Mr Holmes According to his lights he has been a
kind master He wanted me to go with his wife to Germany yesterday
but that would hardly have suited your plans would it sir

No indeed Martha So long as you were here I was easy in my mind
We waited some time for your signal tonight

It was the secretary sir

I know His car passed ours

I thought he would never go I knew that it would not suit your
plans sir to find him here

No indeed Well it only meant that we waited half an hour or so
until I saw your lamp go out and knew that the coast was clear You
can report to me tomorrow in London Martha at Claridges Hotel

Very good sir

I suppose you have everything ready to leave

Yes sir He posted seven letters today I have the addresses as
usual

Very good Martha I will look into them tomorrow Goodnight
These papers he continued as the old lady vanished are not of very
great importance for of course the information which they represent
has been sent off long ago to the German government These are the
originals which could not safely be got out of the country

Then they are of no use

I should not go so far as to say that Watson They will at least
show our people what is known and what is not I may say that a good
many of these papers have come through me and I need not add are
thoroughly untrustworthy It would brighten my declining years to see
a German cruiser navigating the Solent according to the minefield
plans which I have furnished But you Watsonhe stopped his work
and took his old friend by the shouldersIve hardly seen you in the
light yet How have the years used you You look the same blithe boy
as ever

I feel twenty years younger Holmes I have seldom felt so happy as
when I got your wire asking me to meet you at Harwich with the car
But you Holmesyou have changed very littlesave for that horrible
goatee

These are the sacrifices one makes for ones country Watson said
Holmes pulling at his little tuft Tomorrow it will be but a
dreadful memory With my hair cut and a few other superficial changes
I shall no doubt reappear at Claridges tomorrow as I was before this
American stuntI beg your pardon Watson my well of English seems to
be permanently defiledbefore this American job came my way

But you have retired Holmes We heard of you as living the life of a
hermit among your bees and your books in a small farm upon the South
Downs

Exactly Watson Here is the fruit of my leisured ease the magnum
opus of my latter years He picked up the volume from the table and
read out the whole title Practical Handbook of Bee Culture with Some
Observations upon the Segregation of the Queen Alone I did it
Behold the fruit of pensive nights and laborious days when I watched
the little working gangs as once I watched the criminal world of
London

But how did you get to work again

Ah I have often marvelled at it myself The Foreign Minister alone I
could have withstood but when the Premier also deigned to visit my
humble roof The fact is Watson that this gentleman upon the sofa
was a bit too good for our people He was in a class by himself
Things were going wrong and no one could understand why they were
going wrong Agents were suspected or even caught but there was
evidence of some strong and secret central force It was absolutely
necessary to expose it Strong pressure was brought upon me to look
into the matter It has cost me two years Watson but they have not
been devoid of excitement When I say that I started my pilgrimage at
Chicago graduated in an Irish secret society at Buffalo gave serious
trouble to the constabulary at Skibbareen and so eventually caught the
eye of a subordinate agent of Von Bork who recommended me as a likely
man you will realize that the matter was complex Since then I have
been honoured by his confidence which has not prevented most of his
plans going subtly wrong and five of his best agents being in prison
I watched them Watson and I picked them as they ripened Well sir
I hope that you are none the worse

The last remark was addressed to Von Bork himself who after much
gasping and blinking had lain quietly listening to Holmess statement
He broke out now into a furious stream of German invective his face
convulsed with passion Holmes continued his swift investigation of
documents while his prisoner cursed and swore

Though unmusical German is the most expressive of all languages he
observed when Von Bork had stopped from pure exhaustion Hullo
Hullo he added as he looked hard at the corner of a tracing before
putting it in the box This should put another bird in the cage I
had no idea that the paymaster was such a rascal though I have long
had an eye upon him Mister Von Bork you have a great deal to answer
for

The prisoner had raised himself with some difficulty upon the sofa and
was staring with a strange mixture of amazement and hatred at his
captor

I shall get level with you Altamont he said speaking with slow
deliberation If it takes me all my life I shall get level with you

The old sweet song said Holmes How often have I heard it in days
gone by It was a favorite ditty of the late lamented Professor
Moriarty Colonel Sebastian Moran has also been known to warble it
And yet I live and keep bees upon the South Downs

Curse you you double traitor cried the German straining against
his bonds and glaring murder from his furious eyes

No no it is not so bad as that said Holmes smiling As my
speech surely shows you Mr Altamont of Chicago had no existence in
fact I used him and he is gone

Then who are you

It is really immaterial who I am but since the matter seems to
interest you Mr Von Bork I may say that this is not my first
acquaintance with the members of your family I have done a good deal
of business in Germany in the past and my name is probably familiar to
you

I would wish to know it said the Prussian grimly

It was I who brought about the separation between Irene Adler and the
late King of Bohemia when your cousin Heinrich was the Imperial Envoy
It was I also who saved from murder by the Nihilist Klopman Count Von
und Zu Grafenstein who was your mothers elder brother It was I

Von Bork sat up in amazement

There is only one man he cried

Exactly said Holmes

Von Bork groaned and sank back on the sofa And most of that
information came through you he cried What is it worth What have
I done It is my ruin forever

It is certainly a little untrustworthy said Holmes It will
require some checking and you have little time to check it Your
admiral may find the new guns rather larger than he expects and the
cruisers perhaps a trifle faster

Von Bork clutched at his own throat in despair

There are a good many other points of detail which will no doubt
come to light in good time But you have one quality which is very
rare in a German Mr Von Bork you are a sportsman and you will bear
me no illwill when you realize that you who have outwitted so many
other people have at last been outwitted yourself After all you
have done your best for your country and I have done my best for mine
and what could be more natural Besides he added not unkindly as
he laid his hand upon the shoulder of the prostrate man it is better
than to fall before some ignoble foe These papers are now ready
Watson If you will help me with our prisoner I think that we may get
started for London at once

It was no easy task to move Von Bork for he was a strong and a
desperate man Finally holding either arm the two friends walked him
very slowly down the garden walk which he had trod with such proud
confidence when he received the congratulations of the famous
diplomatist only a few hours before After a short final struggle he
was hoisted still bound hand and foot into the spare seat of the
little car His precious valise was wedged in beside him

I trust that you are as comfortable as circumstances permit said
Holmes when the final arrangements were made Should I be guilty of a
liberty if I lit a cigar and placed it between your lips

But all amenities were wasted upon the angry German

I suppose you realize Mr Sherlock Holmes said he that if your
government bears you out in this treatment it becomes an act of war

What about your government and all this treatment said Holmes
tapping the valise

You are a private individual You have no warrant for my arrest The
whole proceeding is absolutely illegal and outrageous

Absolutely said Holmes

Kidnapping a German subject

And stealing his private papers

Well you realize your position you and your accomplice here If I
were to shout for help as we pass through the village

My dear sir if you did anything so foolish you would probably enlarge
the two limited titles of our village inns by giving us The Dangling
Prussian as a signpost The Englishman is a patient creature but at
present his temper is a little inflamed and it would be as well not to
try him too far No Mr Von Bork you will go with us in a quiet
sensible fashion to Scotland Yard whence you can send for your friend
Baron Von Herling and see if even now you may not fill that place
which he has reserved for you in the ambassadorial suite As to you
Watson you are joining us with your old service as I understand so
London wont be out of your way Stand with me here upon the terrace
for it may be the last quiet talk that we shall ever have

The two friends chatted in intimate converse for a few minutes
recalling once again the days of the past while their prisoner vainly
wriggled to undo the bonds that held him As they turned to the car
Holmes pointed back to the moonlit sea and shook a thoughtful head

Theres an east wind coming Watson

I think not Holmes It is very warm

Good old Watson You are the one fixed point in a changing age
Theres an east wind coming all the same such a wind as never blew on
England yet It will be cold and bitter Watson and a good many of us
may wither before its blast But its Gods own wind none the less
and a cleaner better stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the
storm has cleared Start her up Watson for its time that we were on
our way I have a check for five hundred pounds which should be cashed
early for the drawer is quite capable of stopping it if he can
