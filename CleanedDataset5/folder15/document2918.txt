It is six oclock of a November evening in KEITH DARRANTS

readinglamp falling on Turkey carpet on books beside a large
armchair on the deep blueandgold coffee service makes a sort of
oasis before a log fire In red Turkish slippers and an old brown
velvet coat KEITH DARRANT sits asleep He has a dark cleancut
cleanshaven face dark grizzling hair dark twisting eyebrows

 The curtained door away out in the dim part of the room behind
 him is opened so softly that he does not wake LARRY DARRANT
 enters and stands half lost in the curtain over the door A
 thin figure with a worn high cheekboned face deepsunk blue
 eyes and wavy hair all ruffleda face which still has a certain
 beauty He moves inwards along the wall stands still again and
 utters a gasping sigh KEITH stirs in his chair

KEITH Whos there

LARRY In a stifled voice Only ILarry

KEITH Halfwaked Come in I was asleep He does not turn his
head staring sleepily at the fire

 The sound of LARRYs breathing can be heard

 Turning his head a little Well Larry what is it

 LARRY comes skirting along the wall as if craving its support
 outside the radius of the light

 Staring Are you ill

 LARRY stands still again and heaves a deep sigh

KEITH Rising with his back to the fire and staring at his
brother What is it man Then with a brutality born of nerves
suddenly ruffled Have you committed a murder that you stand there

voice changed by sudden apprehension What do you mean by coming
here in this state I told you If you werent my brother
Come here where I can we you Whats the matter with you Larry

 With a lurch LARRY leaves the shelter of the wall and sinks into
 a chair in the circle of light

 KEITH steps quickly forward and stares down into his brothers
 eyes where is a horrified wonder as if they would never again
 get on terms with his face

KEITH Angry bewilderedin a low voice What in Gods name is
this nonsense

 He goes quickly over to the door and draws the curtain aside to
 see that it is shut then comes back to LARRY who is huddling
 over the fire

earth do you mean

LARRY In a shrill outburst Its true I tell you Ive killed a

 CURTAIN




SCENE II

 At out eleven oclock the following night an WANDAS room on the
 ground floor in Soho In the light from one closeshaded
 electric bulb the room is but dimly visible A dying fire burns
 on the left A curtained window in the centre of the back wall
 A door on the right The furniture is plushcovered and
 commonplace with a kind of shabby smartness A couch without
 back or arms stands aslant between window and fire

 On this WANDA is sitting her knees drawn up under her staring
 at the embers She has on only her nightgown and a wrapper over
 it her bare feet are thrust into slippers Her hands are
 crossed and pressed over her breast She starts and looks up
 listening Her eyes are candid and startled her face alabaster
 pale and its pale brown hair short and squarecut curls
 towards her bare neck The startled dark eyes and the faint
 rose of her lips are like colourstaining on a white mask

 Footsteps as of a policeman very measured pass on the
 pavement outside and die away She gets up and steals to the
 window draws one curtain aside so that a chink of the night is
 seen She opens the curtain wider till the shape of a bare
 witchlike tree becomes visible in the open space of the little
 Square on the far side of the road The footsteps are heard
 once more coming nearer WANDA closes the curtains and cranes
 back They pass and die again She moves away and looking down
 at the floor between door and couch as though seeing something
 there shudders covers her eyes goes back to the couch and
 down again just as before to stare at the embers Again she is
 startled by noise of the outer door being opened She springs
 up runs and turns the light by a switch close to the door By
 the glimmer of the fire she can just be seen standing by the
 dark windowcurtains listening There comes the sound of
 subdued knocking on her door She stands in breathless terror
 The knocking is repeated The sound of a latchkey in the door
 is heard Her terror leaves her The door opens a man enters
 in a dark fur overcoat

WANDA In a voice of breathless relief with a rather foreign
accent Oh its you Larry Why did you knock I was so
frightened Come in She crosses quickly and flings her arms
round his neck Recoilingin a terrorstricken whisper Oh Who
is it

KEITH In a smothered voice A friend of Larrys Dont be
frightened

 She has recoiled again to the window and when he finds the
 switch and turns the light up she is seen standing there
 holding her dark wrapper up to her throat so that her face has
 an uncanny look of being detached from the body

Gently You neednt be afraid I havent come to do you harm
quite the contrary Holding up the keys Larry wouldnt have given
me these would he if he hadnt trusted me

 WANDA does not move staring like a spirit startled out of the
 flesh

After looking round him Im sorry to have startled you

WANDA In a whisper Who are you please

KEITH Larrys brother

 WANDA with a sigh of utter relief steals forward to the couch
 and sinks down KEITH goes up to her

Hed told me

WANDA Clasping her hands round her knees Yes

KEITH An awful business

WANDA Yes oh yes Awfulit is awful

KEITH Staring round him again In this room

WANDA Just where you are standing I see him now always falling

KEITH Moved by the gentle despair in her voice Youlook very
young Whats your name

WANDA Wanda

KEITH Are you fond of Larry

WANDA I would die for him

 A moments silence

KEITH IIve come to see what you can do to save him

WANDA Wistfully You would not deceive me You are really his
brother

KEITH Well they have and theyll look for anyone connected with

WANDA He never let people think I was married to him I dont know

was a wicked man He treated many I think like me

KEITH Did my brother ever see him before

WANDA Never And that man first went for him

KEITH Yes I saw the mark Have you a servant

WANDA No A woman come at nine in the morning for an hour

KEITH Does she know Larry

KEITH Sharply Do you mean that

WANDA Oh yes I love him Nobody come here but him for a long
time now

KEITH How long

WANDA Five month

KEITH So you have not been out since

 WANDA shakes her head

What have you been doing

WANDA Simply Crying Pressing her hands to her breast He is
in danger because of me I am so afraid for him

KEITH Checking her emotion Look at me

 She looks at him

If the worst comes and this man is traced to you can you trust
yourself not to give Larry away

WANDA Rising and pointing to the fire Look I have burned all
the things he have given meeven his picture Now I have nothing
from him

KEITH Who has risen too Good One more question Do the police
know youbecauseof your life

 She looks at him intently and shakes her head

You know where Larry lives

WANDA Yes

KEITH You mustnt go there and he mustnt come to you

 She bows her head then suddenly comes close to him

WANDA Please do not take him from me altogether I will be so
careful I will not do anything to hurt him But if I cannot see
him sometimes I shall die Please do not take him from me

 She catches his hand and presses it desperately between her
 own

KEITH Leave that to me Im going to do all I can

WANDA Looking up into his face But you will be kind

 Suddenly she bends and kisses his hand KEITH draws his hand
 away and she recoils a little humbly looking up at him again
 Suddenly she stands rigid listening

In a whisper Listen Someoneout there

 She darts past him and turns out the light There is a knock on
 the door They are now close together between door and window

 Whispering Oh Who is it

KEITH Under his breath You said no one comes but Larry

WANDA Yes and you have his keys Oh if it is Larry I must open

 KEITH shrinks back against the wall WANDA goes to the door

Opening the door an inch Yes Please Who

 A thin streak of light from a bullseye lantern outside plays
 over the wall A Policemans voice says All right Miss
 Your outer doors open You ought to keep it shut after dark
 you know

WANDA Thank you air

 The sound of retreating footsteps of the outer door closing
 WANDA shuts the door

A policeman

KEITH Moving from the wall Curse I must have left that door
Suddenlyturning up the light You told me they didnt know you

WANDA Sighing I did not think they did sir It is so long I
was not out in the town not since I had Larry

 KEITH gives her an intent look then crosses to the fire He
 stands there a moment looking down then turns to the girl who
 has crept back to the couch

KEITH Half to himself After your life who can believe Look
here You drifted together and youll drift apart you know Better
for him to get away and make a clean cut of it

WANDA Uttering a little moaning sound Oh sir May I not love
because I have been bad I was only sixteen when that man spoiled
me If you knew

KEITH Im thinking of Larry With you his danger is much greater
Theres a good chance as things are going You may wreck it And
for what Just a few months more ofwellyou know

WANDA Standing at the head of the couch and touching her eyes with
her hands Oh sir Look It is true He is my life Dont take
him away from me

KEITH Moved and restless You must know what Larry is Hell
never stick to you

WANDA Simply He will sir

KEITH Energetically The last man on earth to stick to anything
But for the sake of a whim hell risk his life and the honour of all
his family I know him

WANDA No no you do not It is I who know him

KEITH Now now At any moment they may find out your connection
with that man So long as Larry goes on with you hes tied to this
murder dont you see

WANDA Coming close to him But he love me Oh sir he love me

KEITH Larry has loved dozens of women

WANDA Yes butHer face quivers

KEITH Brusquely Dont cry If I give you money will you
disappear for his sake

WANDA With a moan It will be in the water then There will be
no cruel men there

KEITH Ah First Larry then you Come now Its better for you
both A few months and youll forget you ever met

WANDA Looking wildly up I will go if Larry say I must But not
to live No Simply I could not sir

 KEITH moved is silent

when she once love It is finish

KEITH I dont want you to go back to that life

WANDA No you do not care what I do Why should you I tell you I
will go if Larry say I must

KEITH Thats not enough You know that You must take it out of
his hands He will never give up his present for the sake of his
future If youre as fond of him as you say youll help to save
him

WANDA Below her breath Yes Oh yes But do not keep him long

KEITH Well well Get up

 There is a tap on the windowpane

Listen

 A faint peculiar whistle 

WANDA Springing up Larry Oh thank God

 She runs to the door opens it and goes out to bring him in
 KEITH stands waiting facing the open doorway

 LARRY entering with WANDA just behind him

LARRY Keith

KEITH Grimly So much for your promise not to go out

snakeshaped ring and they identified this Walenn by it Ive been
down and seen him charged myself

LARRY With murder

WANDA Faintly Larry

KEITH Hes in no danger They always get the wrong man first
Itll do him no harm to be locked up a bithyena like that Better

They were fools to think he could have had the strength

 He laughs and the terrified girl presses herself against him

An innocent man

KEITH Hes in no danger I tell you He could never have
strangledWhy he hadnt the strength of a kitten Now Larry
Ill take your berth tomorrow Heres money He brings out a pile
of notes and puts them on the couch You can make a new life of it
out there together presently in the sun

Suddenly How can I Keith I must see how it goes with that poor
devil

KEITH Bosh Dismiss it from your mind theres not nearly enough
evidence

LARRY Not

KEITH No Youve got your chance Take it like a man

LARRY With a strange smileto the girl Shall we Wanda

WANDA Oh Larry

LARRY Picking the notes up from the couch Take them back Keith

KEITH What I tell you no jury would convict and if they did no
judge would hang A ghoul who can rob a dead body ought to be in
prison He did worse than you

LARRY It wont do Keith I must see it out

KEITH Dont be a fool

LARRY Ive still got some kind of honour If I clear out before I
know I shall have nonenor peace Take them Keith or Ill put
them in the fire

KEITH Taking back the notes bitterly I suppose I may ask you
not to be entirely oblivious of our name Or is that unworthy of

WANDA Clasping him desperately Oh Larry Larry

LARRY Holding her away to look at her Take off those things and
put on a bridal garment

WANDA Promise mewherever you go I go too Promise Larry you
think I havent seen all these weeks But I have seen everything
all in your heart always You cannot hide from me I knewI knew
Oh if we might go away into the sun Oh Larrycouldnt we She
searches his eyes with hersthen shuddering Well If it must be
darkI dont care if I may go in your arms In prison we could not
be together I am ready Only love me first Dont let me cry
before I go Oh Larry will there be much pain

LARRY In a choked voice No pain my pretty

WANDA With a little sigh It is a pity

LARRY If you had seen him as I have all day being tortured
Wandawe shall be out of it The wine mounting to his head We
shall be free in the dark free of their cursed inhumanities I hate
this worldI loathe it I hate its Godforsaken savagery its pride
and smugness Keiths worldall righteous willpower and success
Were no good here you and Iwe were cast out at birthsoft
willlessbetter dead No fear Keith Im staying indoors He
pours wine into two glasses Drink it up


 Obediently WANDA drinks and he also

Now go and make yourself beautiful

WANDA Seizing him in her arms Oh Larry

LARRY Touching her face and hair Hanged by the neck until hes
deadfor what I did

 WANDA takes a long look at his face slips her arms from him
 and goes out through the curtains below the fireplace

 LARRY feels in his pocket brings out the little box opens it
 fingers the white tabloids

LARRY Two eachafter food He laughs and puts back the box Oh
my girl

 The sound of a piano playing a faint festive tune is heard afar
 off He mutters staring at the fire

 Flamesflame and flickerashes

No more no more the moon is dead And all the people in it

 He sits on the couch with a piece of paper on his knees adding
 a few words with a stylo pen to what is already written

 The GIRL in a silk wrapper coming back through the curtains
 watches him

LARRY Looking up Its all hereIve confessed Reading

Please bury us together

LAURENCE DARRANT

January 28th about six pm

Theyll find us in the morning Come and have supper my dear love

 The girl creeps forward He rises puts his arm round her and
 with her arm twined round him smiling into each others faces
 they go to the table and sit down

 The curtain falls for a few seconds to indicate the passage of
 three hours When it rises again the lovers are lying on the
 couch in each others arms the lilies stream about them The
 girls bare arm is round LARRYS neck Her eyes are closed his
 are open and sightless There is no light but firelight

 A knocking on the door and the sound of a key turned in the
 lock KEITH enters He stands a moment bewildered by the
 halflight then calls sharply Larry and turns up the light
 Seeing the forms on the couch he recoils a moment Then
 glancing at the table and empty decanters goes up to the couch

KEITH Muttering Asleep Drunk Ugh

 Suddenly he bends touches LARRY and springs back

What He bends again shakes him and calls Larry Larry

 Then motionless he stares down at his brothers open
 sightless eyes Suddenly he wets his finger and holds it to the
 girls lips then to LARRYS

 He bends and listens at their hearts catches sight of the
 little box lying between them and takes it up

My God

 Then raising himself he closes his brothers eyes and as he
 does so catches sight of a paper pinned to the couch detaches
 it and reads

I Lawrence Darrant about to die by my own hand confess that I

 He reads on silently in horror finishes letting the paper
 drop and recoils from the couch on to a chair at the
 dishevelled supper table Aghast he sits there Suddenly he
 mutters

If I leave that theremy namemy whole future

 He springs up takes up the paper again and again reads

My God Its ruin

 He makes as if to tear it across stops and looks down at
 those two covers his eyes with his hand drops the paper and
 rushes to the door But he stops there and comes back
 magnetised as it were by that paper He takes it up once more
 and thrusts it into his pocket

 The footsteps of a Policeman pass slow and regular outside
 His face crisps and quivers he stands listening till they die
 away Then he snatches the paper from his pocket and goes past
 the foot of the couch to the fore

All myNo Let him hang

 He thrusts the paper into the fire stamps it down with his
 foot watches it writhe and blacken Then suddenly clutching
 his head he turns to the bodies on the couch Panting and like
 a man demented he recoils past the head of the couch and
 rushing to the window draws the curtains and throws the window
 up for air Out in the darkness rises the witchlike skeleton
 tree where a dark shape seems hanging KEITH starts back

Whats that What

 He shuts the window and draws the dark curtains across it
 again

Fool Nothing

 Clenching his fists he draws himself up steadying himself
 with all his might Then slowly he moves to the door stands a
 second like a carved figure his face hard as stone

 Deliberately he turns out the light opens the door and goes

 The still bodies lie there before the fire which is licking at
 the last blackened wafer


CURTAIN
