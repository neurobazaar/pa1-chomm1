Administrative divisions The numbers designatory terms and
firstorder administrative divisions are generally those approved by
the US Board on Geographic Names BGN Changes that have been
reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted

Airports Only airports with usable runways are included in this
listing For airports with more than one runway only the longest
runway is included Not all airports have facilities for refueling
maintenance or air traffic control Paved runways have concrete or
asphalt surfaces unpaved runways have grass dirt sand or gravel
surfaces

Area Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by
international boundaries andor coastlines Land area is the aggregate
of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries andor
coastlines excluding inland water bodies lakes reservoirs rivers
Comparative areas are based on total area equivalents Most entities
are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states The smaller
entities are compared with Washington DC 178 sq km 69 sq mi or The
Mall in Washington DC 059 sq km 023 sq mi 146 acres

Birth rate The average annual number of births during a year per
1000 population at midyear also known as crude birth rate Dates of
information In general information available as of 1 January 1995 is
used in the preparation of this edition Population figures are
estimates for 1 July 1995 with population growth rates estimated for
calendar year 1995 Major political events have been updated through
April 1995

Death rate The average annual number of deaths during a year per
l000 population at midyear also known as crude death rate

Digraphs The digraph is a twoletter country code that precisely
identifies every entity without overlap duplication or omission AF
for example is the digraph for Afghanistan It is a standardized
geopolitical data element promulgated in the Federal Information
Processing Standards Publication FIPS 103 by the National Bureau of
Standards now called National Institute of Standards and Technology
at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the Office of the
Geographer at the US Department of State The digraph is used to
eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection processing
and dissemination of areaspecific data and is particularly useful for
interchanging data between databases

Diplomatic representation The US Government has diplomatic relations
with 184 nations including 178 of the 185 UN members excluded UN
members are Bhutan Cuba Iran Iraq North Korea former Yugoslavia
and the US itself In addition the US has diplomatic relations with
6 nations that are not in the UN  Holy See Kiribati Nauru
Switzerland Tonga and Tuvalu

Economic aid This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official
development assistance ODA and other official flows OOF ODA is
defined as financial assistance which is concessional in character
has the main objective to promote economic development and welfare of
LDCs and contains a grant element of at least 25 OOF transactions
are also official government assistance but with a main objective
other than development and with a grant element less than 25 OOF
transactions include official export credits such as ExIm Bank
credits official equity and portfolio investment and debt
reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional
terms Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are
initialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration
of intent

Entities Some of the nations dependent areas areas of special
sovereignty and governments included in this publication are not
independent and others are not officially recognized by the US
Government Nation refers to a people politically organized into a
sovereign state with a definite territory Dependent area refers to
a broad category of political entities that are associated in some way
with a nation Names used for page headings are usually the shortform

Exchange rate
The official value of a nations monetary unit at a given date or over
a given period of time as expressed in units of local currency per US
dollar and as determined by international market forces or official
fiat

GDP methodology In the Economy section GDP dollar estimates for
all countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP
calculations rather than from conversions at official currency
exchange rates The PPP method normally involves the use of
international dollar price weights which are applied to the
quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy In
addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries
the statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying identifying
and allowing for the quality of goods and services The division of a
GDP estimate in local currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in
dollars gives the PPP conversion rate On average one thousand
dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one
thousand dollars  converted to the local currency at the PPP
conversion rate  will buy in the other country Whereas PPP estimates
for OECD countries are quite reliable PPP estimates for developing
countries are often rough approximations Most of the GDP estimates
are based on extrapolation of numbers published by the UN
International Comparison Program and by Professors Robert Summers and
Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues
Currency exchange rates depend on a variety of international and
domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic
output In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate
estimate of GDP in dollars is typically onefourth to onehalf the PPP
estimate Furthermore exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by
10 or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real
output has remained unchanged On 12 January 1994 for example the 14
countries of the African Financial Community whose currencies are
tied to the French franc devalued their currencies by 50 This move
of course did not cut the real output of these countries by half One
important caution the proportion of say defense expenditures as a
percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially
from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms as
for example when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of
Russian or Japanese military expenditures Note The numbers for GDP
and other economic data can not be chained together from successive
volumes of the Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring
rod revisions of data by statistical agencies use of new or
different sources of information and changes in national statistical
methods and practices

Gross domestic product GDP The value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year

Gross national product GNP The value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year plus income earned
abroad minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production

Gross world product GWP The aggregate value of all goods and
services produced worldwide in a given year

Growth rate population The annual percent change in the population
resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over deaths and the
balance of migrants entering and leaving a country The rate may be
positive or negative

Illicit drugs There are five categories of illicit drugs  narcotics

Infant mortality rate The number of deaths to infants under one year
old in a given year per l000 live births occurring in the same year

International disputes This category includes a wide variety of
situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to
unilateral claims of one sort or another Information regarding
disputes over international boundaries and maritime boundaries has
been reviewed by the Department of State References to other
situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included such
as resource disputes geopolitical questions or irredentist issues
However inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance
or recognition by the US Government

Irrigated land The figure refers to the land area that is
artificially supplied with water

Land use The land surface is categorized as arable land  land
cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest wheat
maize rice permanent crops  land cultivated for crops that are not
replanted after each harvest citrus coffee rubber meadows and
pastures  land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops forest
and woodland  under dense or open stands of trees and other  any
land type not specifically mentioned above urban areas roads
desert

Leaders The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who
represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but is not
involved with the day today activities of the government The head
of government is the administrative leader who manages the daytoday
activities of the government In the UK the monarch is the chief of
state and the Prime Minister is the head of government In the US
the President is both the chief of state and the head of government

Life expectancy at birth The average number of years to be lived by a
group of people all born in the same year if mortality at each age
remains constant in the future

Literacy There are no universal definitions and standards of
literacy Unless otherwise noted all rates are based on the most
common definition  the ability to read and write at a specified age
Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the
ability to read and write is beyond the scope of this publication

Maritime claims The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some
national claims from being extended the full distance

Merchant marine All ships engaged in the carriage of goods All
commercial vessels as opposed to all nonmilitary ships which
excludes tugs fishing vessels offshore oil rigs etc Also a
grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register
Captive register  A register of ships maintained by a territory
possession or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships
owned in the parent country also referred to as an offshore register
the offshore equivalent of an internal register Ships on a captive
register will fly the same flag as the parent country or a local
variant of it but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation
rules of the offshore territory Although the nature of a captive
register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent
country just as in the internal register the ships may also be owned
abroad The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register except that it is not the register of an independent state
Flag of convenience register  A national register offering
registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state The major
flags of convenience FOC attract ships to their registers by virtue
of low fees low or nonexistent taxation of profits and liberal
manning requirements True FOC registers are characterized by having
relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag
state Thus while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a
given set of circumstances an FOC register is one where the majority
of the merchant fleet is owned abroad It is also referred to as an
open register
Flag state  The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds
legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship whether at home or
abroad Flag state maritime legislation determines how a ship is
manned and taxed and whether a foreignowned ship may be placed on the
register
Internal register  A register of ships maintained as a subset of a
national register Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of
maritime rules from those on the main national register These
differences usually include lower taxation of profits manning by
foreign nationals and usually ownership outside the flag state
when it functions as an FOC register The Norwegian International
Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most
notable examples of an internal register Both have been instrumental
in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and
in attracting foreign owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags
Merchant ship  A vessel that carries goods against payment of
freight commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately
restricted to commercial vessels only
Register  The record of a ships ownership and nationality as listed
with the maritime authorities of a country also the compendium of
such individual ships registrations Registration of a ship provides
it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country
in which registered the flag state regardless of the nationality of
the ships ultimate owner

Money figures All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US
dollars unless otherwise indicated

National product The total output of goods and services in a country
in a given year See GDP methodology Gross domestic product GDP
and Gross national product GNP

Net migration rate The balance between the number of persons entering
and leaving a country during the year per 1000 persons based on
midyear population An excess of persons entering the country is
referred to as net immigration 356 migrants1000 population an
excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration 926
migrants1000 population

Population Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based
on statistics from population censuses vital statistics registration
systems or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on
assumptions about future trends Starting with the 1993 Factbook
demographic estimates for some countries mostly African have taken
into account the effects of the growing incidence of AIDS infections
in 1993 these countries were Burkina Burundi Central African
Republic Congo Cote dIvoire Kenya Malawi Rwanda Tanzania
Uganda Zaire Zambia Zimbabwe Thailand Brazil and Haiti

Telephone numbers All telephone numbers presented in the Factbook
consist of the country code in brackets the city or area code where
required in parentheses and the local number The one component that
is not presented is the international access code which varies from
country to country For example an international direct dial phone
call placed from the United States to Madrid Spain would be as
follows

 011 34 1 577xxxx where
 011 is the international access code for stationtostation calls
 01 is for calls other than stationtostation calls
 34 is the country code for Spain
 1 is the city code for Madrid
 577 is the local exchange
 and xxxx is the local telephone number

An international direct dial phone call placed from another country to
the United States would be as follows

international access code  1 202 939xxxx where
 1 is the country code for the United States
 202 is the area code for Washington DC
 939 is the local exchange
 and xxxx is the local telephone number

Total fertility rate The average number of children that would be
born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing
years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each
age Years All year references are for the calendar year CY unless
indicated as fiscal year FY FY9394 refers to the fiscal year that
began in calendar year 1993 and ended in calendar year 1994 as defined
in the Fiscal Year entry of the Economy section for each nation
FY9094 refers to the four fiscal years that began in calendar year
1990 and ended in calendar year 1994

AfghanistanEconomy

 Overview Afghanistan is an extremely poor landlocked country highly
 dependent on farming wheat especially and livestock raising sheep
 and goats Economic considerations have played second fiddle to
 political and military upheavals during more than 15 years of war
 including the nearly 10year Soviet military occupation which ended
 15 February 1989 Over the past decade onethird of the population
 fled the country with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million
 refugees and Iran about 3 million About 14 million Afghan refugees
 remain in Pakistan and about 2 million in Iran Another 1 million
 probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan
 Although reliable data are unavailable gross domestic product is
 lower than 13 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and
 the disruption of trade and transport

AlbaniaEconomy

 Overview An extremely poor country by European standards Albania is
 making the difficult transition to a more openmarket economy The
 economy rebounded in 199394 after a severe depression accompanying
 the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in 1990 and
 1991 Stabilization policies  including a strict monetary policy
 public sector layoffs and reduced social services  have improved the
 governments fiscal situation and reduced inflation The recovery was
 spurred by the remittances of some 20 of the population which works
 abroad mostly in Greece and Italy These remittances supplement GDP
 and help offset the large foreign trade deficit Foreign assistance
 and humanitarian aid also supported the recovery Most agricultural
 land was privatized in 1992 substantially improving peasant incomes
 Albanias limited industrial sector now less than onesixth of GDP
 continued to decline in 1994 A sharp fall in chromium prices reduced
 hard currency receipts from the mining sector Large segments of the
 population especially those living in urban areas continue to depend
 on humanitarian aid to meet basic food requirements Unemployment
 remains a severe problem accounting for approximately onefifth of the
 work force Growth is expected to continue in 1995 but could falter
 if Albania becomes involved in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia
 workers remittances from Greece are reduced or foreign assistance
 declines

AlgeriaEconomy

 Overview The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the economy
 accounting for roughly 57 of government revenues 25 of GDP and
 almost all export earnings Algeria has the fifth largest reserves of
 natural gas in the world and ranks fourteenth for oil Algiers
 efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the
 Arab world began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged
 the country into a severe recession In 1989 the government launched
 a comprehensive IMFsupported program to achieve macroeconomic
 stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy
 Despite substantial progress toward macroeconomic adjustment in 1992
 the reform drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political
 turmoil In September 1993 a new government was formed and one
 priority was the resumption and acceleration of the structural
 adjustment process Buffeted by the slump in world oil prices and
 burdened with a heavy foreign debt Algiers concluded a oneyear
 standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994

 limited by a scarcity of arable land and most food has to be
 imported The principal livestock activity is sheep raising
 Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes cigars and furniture

 the European Single Market will have on the advantages Andorra obtains
 from its dutyfree status

AngolaEconomy

 Overview Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for
 8090 of the population but accounts for less than 15 of GDP Oil
 production is vital to the economy contributing about 60 to GDP
 Despite the signing of a peace accord in November 1994 between the
 Angola government and the UNITA insurgents sporadic fighting
 continues and many farmers remain reluctant to return to their fields
 As a result much of the countrys food requirements must still be
 imported Angola has rich natural resources  notably gold diamonds
 and arable land in addition to large oil deposits  but will need to
 observe the ceasefire implement the peace agreement and reform
 government policies if it is to achieve its potential

ArgentinaEconomy

 Overview Argentina rich in natural resources benefits also from a
 highly literate population an exportoriented agricultural sector
 and a diversified industrial base Nevertheless following decades of
 mismanagement and statist policies the economy in the late 1980s was
 plagued with huge external debts and recurring bouts of
 hyperinflation Elected in 1989 in the depths of recession President
 MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring program
 that shows signs of putting Argentina on a path of stable sustainable
 growth Argentinas currency has traded at par with the US dollar
 since April 1991 and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20
 years Argentines have responded to the relative price stability by
 repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry The
 economy registered an impressive 6 advance in 1994 fueled largely by
 inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption spending
 The governments major short term objective is encouraging exports
 eg by reducing domestic costs of production At the start of 1995
 the government had to deal with the spillover from international
 financial movements associated with the devaluation of the Mexican
 peso In addition unemployment had become a serious issue for the
 government Despite average annual 7 growth in 199194 unemployment
 surprisingly has doubled  due mostly to layoffs in government bureaus
 and in privatized industrial firms and utilities and to a lesser
 degree to illegal immigration Much remains to be done in the 1990s
 in dismantling the old statist barriers to growth extending the
 recent economic gains and bringing down the rate of unemployment

ArmeniaEconomy

 Overview Under the old Soviet central planning system Armenia had
 developed a more modern industrial sector supplying machine building
 equipment textiles and other manufactured goods to sister republics
 in exchange for raw materials and energy resources Armenia is a large
 food importer and its mineral deposits gold bauxite are small The
 economic decline in recent years 199194 has been particularly
 severe due to the ongoing conflict over the ethnic Armeniandominated
 region of NagornoKarabakh in Azerbaijan Azerbaijan and Turkey have
 blockaded pipeline and railroad traffic to Armenia for its support of
 the Karabakh Armenians This has left Armenia with chronic energy
 shortages because of a lack of capacity and frequent disruptions of
 natural gas deliveries through unstable Georgia as well as
 difficulties in obtaining other types of fuel In addition bread is
 strictly rationed and there are shortages of other goods In 1994 the
 economy seemed to bottom out The government has managed to increase
 its financial and budgetary discipline bringing inflation down from
 around 40 per month in first half 1994 to single digits in second
 half 1994 and the first quarter of 1995 A full economic recovery
 cannot be expected until the conflict is settled and the blockade
 lifted

 offshore banking and oil refining and storage are also important The

 in a substantial expansion of other activities Construction has
 boomed with hotel capacity five times the 1985 level Additionally
 the reopening of the countrys oil refinery in 1993 a major source of
 employment and foreign exchange earnings has further spurred growth

AustraliaEconomy

 Overview Australia has a prosperous Westernstyle capitalist economy
 with a per capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West
 European countries Rich in natural resources Australia is a major
 exporter of agricultural products minerals metals and fossil fuels
 Primary products account for more than 60 of the value of total
 exports so that as in 198384 a downturn in world commodity prices
 can have a big impact on the economy The government is pushing for
 increased exports of manufactured goods but competition in
 international markets continues to be severe Australia has suffered
 from the low growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD
 countries in the early 1990s In 199293 the economy recovered slowly
 from the prolonged recession of 199091 a major restraining factor
 being weak world demand for Australias exports Growth picked up so
 strongly in 1994 that the government felt the need for fiscal and
 monetary tightening by yearend Australias GDP grew 64 in 1994
 largely due to increases in industrial output and business investment
 A severe drought in 1994 is expected to reduce the value of
 Australias net farm production by 825 million in the twelve months
 through June 1995 but rising world commodity prices are likely to
 boost rural exports by 77 to 145 billion in 199596 according to
 government statistics

AustriaEconomy

 Overview Austria boasts a prosperous and stable market economy with a
 sizable but falling proportion of nationalized industry and with
 extensive welfare benefits Thanks to its raw material endowment a
 technically skilled labor force and strong links to German industrial
 firms Austria occupies specialized niches in European industry and
 services tourism banking and produces almost enough food to feed
 itself with only 8 of the labor force in agriculture After 11
 consecutive years of growth the Austrian economy experienced a mild
 recession in 1993 but growth resumed in 1994 Unemployment is 43
 and will likely stay at that level as companies adjust to the
 competition of EU membership beginning 1 January 1995 To prepare for
 EU membership Austrias government has taken measures to open the
 economy by introducing a major tax reform privatizing stateowned
 firms and liberalizing crossborder capital movements Problems for
 the 1990s include an aging population the high level of industrial
 subsidies and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary
 capabilities  the deficit climbed to over 4 of GDP in 1994

AZERBAIJAN

 NoteAzerbaijan continues to be plagued by an unresolved
 sevenyearold conflict with Armenian separatists over its
 NagornoKarabakh region The Karabakh Armenians have declared
 independence and seized almost 20 of the countrys territory
 creating almost 1 million Azeri displaced persons in the process Both
 sides have generally observed a Russianmediated ceasefire in place
 since May 1994 and support the OSCEmediated peace process now
 entering its fourth year Nevertheless Baku and Xankandi
 Stepanakert remain far apart on most substantive issues from the
 placement and composition of a peacekeeping force to the enclaves
 ultimate political status and prospects for a negotiated settlement
 remain dim

AzerbaijanEconomy

 Overview Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either
 Armenia or Georgia the other Transcaucasian states It resembles the
 Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim population high
 structural unemployment and low standard of living The economys
 most prominent products are oil cotton and gas Production from the
 Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline for several years but
 the November 1994 ratification of the 75 billion oil deal with a
 consortium of Western companies should generate the funds needed to
 spur future industrial development Azerbaijan accounted for 15 to
 2 of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet Union
 Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the exSoviet
 republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy
 but its considerable energy resources brighten its longterm
 prospects Baku has only recently begun making progress on economic
 reform and old economic ties and structures have yet to be replaced

BahrainEconomy

 Overview Tiny in area Bahrain is welltodo in economic resources
 and per capita income Petroleum production and processing account for
 about 80 of export receipts 60 of government revenues and 30 of
 GDP Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing fortunes of
 oil since 1985 for example during and following the Gulf crisis of
 199091 With its highly developed communication and transport
 facilities Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms with
 business in the Gulf A large share of exports consists of petroleum
 products made from imported crude Prospects for 1995 are good with
 private enterprise the main driving force eg in banking and
 construction Unemployment especially among the young and the
 depletion of both oil and underground water resources are major
 longterm economic problems

BangladeshEconomy

 Overview Despite sustained domestic and international efforts to
 improve economic and demographic prospects Bangladesh remains one of
 the worlds poorest most densely populated and least developed
 nations Its economy is overwhelmingly agricultural with the
 cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the economy
 Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods the
 inefficiency of stateowned enterprises a rapidly growing labor force
 that cannot be absorbed by agriculture delays in exploiting energy
 resources natural gas and inadequate power supplies Excellent rice
 crops and expansion of the export garment industry led to real growth
 of 4 in 1992 and again in 1993 Policy measures intended to reduce
 government regulation of private industry to curb population growth
 and to expand employment opportunities have had only partial success
 given the serious nature of Bangladeshs basic problems

BarbadosEconomy

 Overview A per capita income of 9200 gives Barbados one of the
 highest standards of living of all the small island states of the
 eastern Caribbean Historically the economy was based on the
 cultivation of sugarcane and related activities In recent years
 however the economy has diversified into manufacturing and tourism A
 moderate recovery that began in late 1993 after 3 years of contraction
 is mainly due to increased tourism and expansion in the construction
 sector Economic prospects for 1995 depend mostly on continued growth
 in the industrialized countries especially in Europe which would
 spur further expansion in tourism

BelarusEconomy

 Overview Belarus ranks among the most developed of the former Soviet
 states with a relatively modern  by Soviet standards  and diverse
 machine building sector and a robust agriculture sector It also
 serves as a transport link for Russian oil exports to the Baltic
 states and Eastern and Western Europe The breakup of the Soviet Union
 and its command economy has resulted in a sharp economic contraction
 as traditional trade ties have collapsed The Belarusian government
 has lagged behind the governments of most other former Soviet states
 in economic reform with privatization almost nonexistent The system
 of state orders and distribution persists In mid1994 the Belarusian
 government embarked on an austerity program with IMF support to slash
 state credits and consumer subsidies in order to bring down the budget
 deficit and reduce inflation However despite its promising start
 the regimes drive to reinvigorate the economy has fallen short and
 the IMF has criticized its failure to implement the reforms that the
 Fund had negotiated As a result the IMF has suspended talks on
 introducing a standby arrangement Economic relations with Russia
 which will have an important bearing on the future course of the
 economy will be strengthened if Minsk adopts the necessary
 legislation to implement a customs union agreed to in January 1995

 quantities of raw materials and export a large volume of manufactures

BeninEconomy

 Overview The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on
 subsistence agriculture cotton production and regional trade Growth
 in real output has averaged a sound 4 in 199194 but this rate barely
 exceeds the rapid population growth of 33 Inflation jumped to 35
 in 1994 compared to 3 in 1993 following the 50 currency
 devaluation in January Commercial and transport activities which
 make up almost 36 of GDP are extremely vulnerable to developments in
 Nigeria as evidenced by decreased reexport trade in 1994 due to a
 severe contraction in Nigerian demand The industrial sector accounts
 for less than 10 of GDP and mainly produces foods beverages cement
 and textiles Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral
 creditors has eased the external debt situation in recent years The
 government still burdened with moneylosing state enterprises and a
 bloated civil service is gradually implementing a World Bank
 supported structural adjustment program

BhutanEconomy

 Overview The economy one of the worlds least developed is based on
 agriculture and forestry which provide the main livelihood for 90 of
 the population and account for about half of GDP Agriculture consists
 largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry Rugged mountains
 dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other
 infrastructure difficult and expensive The economy is closely aligned
 with Indias through strong trade and monetary links The industrial
 sector is small and technologically backward with most production of
 the cottage industry type Most development projects such as road
 construction rely on Indian migrant labor Bhutans hydropower
 potential and its attraction for tourists are key resources however
 the government limits the number of tourists to 4000 per year to
 minimize foreign influence Much of the impetus for growth has come
 from large publicsector companies Nevertheless in recent years
 Bhutan has shifted toward decentralized development planning and
 greater private initiative The government privatized several large
 publicsector firms is revamping its trade regime and liberalizing
 administerial procedures over industrial licensing The governments

BoliviaEconomy

 Overview With its long history of semifeudal social controls
 dependence on volatile prices for its mineral exports and bouts of
 hyperinflation Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least
 developed Latin American countries However Bolivia has experienced
 generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro
 administration 198589 introduced marketoriented policies which
 reduced inflation from 11700 in 1985 to about 20 in 1988 PAZ
 Estenssoro was followed as President by Jaime PAZ Zamora 198993 who
 continued the freemarket policies of his predecessor despite
 opposition from his own party and from Bolivias once powerful labor
 movement By maintaining fiscal discipline PAZ Zamora helped reduce
 inflation to 93 in 1993 while GDP grew by an annual average of
 325 during his tenure Inaugurated in August 1993 President SANCHEZ
 DE LOZADA has vowed to advance the marketoriented economic reforms he
 helped launch as PAZ Estenssoros planning minister His successes so
 far have included an inflation rate that continues to decrease  the
 1994 rate of 85 was the lowest in ten years  the signing of a free
 trade agreement with Mexico and progress on his unique privatization
 plan The main privatization bill was passed by the Bolivian
 legislature in late March 1994 Related laws  one that establishes
 SIRESE the regulatory agency that will oversee the privatizations
 and another that outlines the rules for privatization in the
 electricity sector  were approved later in the year

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

 NoteBosnia and Herzegovina is set to enter its third year of
 interethnic civil strife which began in the spring of 1992 after the
 Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina held a referendum on
 independence Bosnias Serbs  supported by neighboring Serbia 
 responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic
 along ethnic lines and joining Serbheld areas to greater Serbia In
 March 1994 Bosnias Muslims and Croats reduced the number of warring
 factions from three to two by signing an agreement in Washington DC
 creating the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina A group of rebel
 Muslims however continues to battle government forces in the
 northwest enclave of Bihac A Contact Group of countries the US UK
 France Germany and Russia continues to seek a resolution between
 the Federation and the Bosnian Serbs In July of 1994 the Contact
 Group presented a plan to the warring parties that roughly equally
 divides the country between the two while maintaining Bosnia in its
 current internationally recognized borders The Federation agreed to
 the plan almost immediately while the Bosnian Serbs rejected it

Bosnia And HerzegovinaEconomy

 Overview Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former Yugoslav
 Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav
 federation Although agriculture has been almost all in private hands
 farms have been small and inefficient and the republic traditionally
 has been a net importer of food Industry has been greatly
 overstaffed one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central
 planning and management TITO had pushed the development of military
 industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large
 share of Yugoslavias defense plants As of February 1995 Bosnia and
 Herzegovina was being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic
 warfare that has caused production to plummet unemployment and
 inflation to soar and human misery to multiply No economic
 statistics for 199294 are available although output clearly has
 fallen substantially below the levels of earlier years and almost
 certainly is well below 1000 per head The country receives
 substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from the international
 community

BotswanaEconomy

 Overview The economy has historically been based on cattle raising
 and crops Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80
 of the population but supplies only about 50 of food needs and
 accounts for only 5 of GDP Subsistence farming and cattle raising
 predominate The driving force behind the rapid economic growth of the
 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry This sector mostly on
 the strength of diamonds has gone from generating 25 of GDP in 1980
 to 39 in 1994 No other sector has experienced such growth
 especially not agriculture which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
 poor soils The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25 Hampered
 by a still sluggish diamond market in 1994 GDP grew by only 1

BrazilEconomy

 Overview The economy with large agrarian mining and manufacturing
 sectors entered the 1990s with declining real growth runaway
 inflation an unserviceable foreign debt of 122 billion and a lack
 of policy direction In addition the economy remained highly
 regulated inwardlooking and protected by substantial trade and
 investment barriers Ownership of major industrial and mining
 facilities is divided among private interests  including several
 multinationals  and the government Most large agricultural holdings
 are private with the government channeling financing to this sector
 Conflicts between large landholders and landless peasants have
 produced intermittent violence The COLLOR government which assumed
 office in March 1990 launched an ambitious reform program that sought
 to modernize and reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices
 deregulating the economy and opening it to increased foreign
 competition Itamar FRANCO who assumed the presidency following
 President COLLORs resignation in December 1992 was out of step with
 COLLORs reform agenda initiatives to redress fiscal problems
 privatize state enterprises and liberalize trade and investment
 policies lost momentum Galloping inflation  by June 1994 the monthly
 rate had risen to nearly 50  had undermined economic stability In
 response the then finance minister Fernando Henrique CARDOSO
 launched the third phase of his stabilization plan known as Plano
 Real that called for a new currency the real which was introduced
 on 1 July 1994 Inflation subsequently dropped to under 3 per month
 through the end of 1994 The newly elected President CARDOSO has
 called for the implementation of sweeping marketoriented reform
 including public sector and fiscal reform privatization
 deregulation and elimination of barriers to increased foreign
 investment Brazils natural resources remain a major longterm

 Overview The economy one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean
 area is highly dependent on the tourist industry which generates
 about 21 of the national income In 1985 the government offered
 offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the
 islands and in consequence incorporation fees generated about 2
 million in 1987 The economy slowed in 1991 because of the poor
 performances of the tourist sector and tight commercial bank credit
 Livestock raising is the most significant agricultural activity The

BulgariaEconomy

 Overview The Bulgarian economy continued its painful adjustment in
 1994 from the misdirected development undertaken during four decades
 of Communist rule Many aspects of a market economy have been put in
 place and have begun to function but much of the economy especially
 the industrial sector has yet to reestablish market links lost with
 the collapse of the other centrally planned Soviet Bloc economies The
 prices of many imported industrial inputs especially energy products
 have risen markedly and falling real wages have not sufficed to
 restore competitiveness The government plans more extensive
 privatization in 1995 to improve the management of enterprises and to
 encourage foreign investment Bulgaria resumed payments on its 10
 billion in commercial debt in 1993 following the negotiation of a 50
 writeoff

BurmaEconomy

 Overview Burma has a mixed economy with about 75 private activity
 mainly in agriculture light industry and transport and with about
 25 statecontrolled activity mainly in energy heavy industry and
 foreign trade Government policy in the last six years 198994 has
 aimed at revitalizing the economy after four decades of tight central
 planning Thus private activity has markedly increased foreign
 investment has been encouraged so far with moderate success and
 efforts continue to increase the efficiency of state enterprises
 Published estimates of Burmas foreign trade are greatly understated
 because of the volume of black market trade A major ongoing problem
 is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal stability Although
 Burma remains a poor Asian country its rich resources furnish the
 potential for substantial longterm increases in income exports and
 living standards

BurundiEconomy

 Overview A landlocked resourcepoor country in an early stage of
 economic development Burundi since October 1993 has suffered from
 massive ethnicbased violence that has displaced an estimated million
 people disrupted production and set back needed reform programs
 Burundi is predominately agricultural with roughly 90 of the
 population dependent on subsistence agriculture Its economic health
 depends on the coffee crop which accounts for 80 of foreign exchange
 earnings The ability to pay for imports therefore continues to rest
 largely on the vagaries of the climate and the international coffee
 market As part of its economic reform agenda launched in February
 1991 with IMF and World Bank support Burundi is trying to diversify
 its agricultural exports attract foreign investment in industry and
 modernize government budgetary practices Although the government
 remains committed to reforms it fears new austerity measures would
 add to ethnic tensions

CambodiaEconomy

 Overview The Cambodian economy  virtually destroyed by decades of
 war  is slowly recovering Government leaders are moving toward
 restoring fiscal and monetary discipline and have established good
 working relations with international financial institutions Growth
 starting from a low base has been strong in 199194 Despite such
 positive developments the reconstruction effort faces many tough
 challenges because of the persistence of internal political divisions
 and the related lack of confidence of foreign investors Rural
 Cambodia where 90 of about 95 million Khmer live remains mired in
 poverty The almost total lack of basic infrastructure in the
 countryside will hinder development and will contribute to a growing
 imbalance in growth between urban and rural areas over the near term
 Moreover the governments lack of experience in administering
 economic and technical assistance programs and rampant corruption
 among officials will slow the growth of critical public sector
 investment Inflation for 1994 as a whole was less than a quarter of
 the 1992 rate and was declining during the year

CameroonEconomy

 Overview Because of its offshore oil resources and favorable
 agricultural conditions Cameroon has one of the bestendowed most
 diversified primary commodity economies in subSaharan Africa Still
 it faces many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped
 countries such as political instability a topheavy civil service
 and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise The
 development of the oil sector led rapid economic growth between 1970
 and 1985 Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986 precipitated by steep
 declines in the prices of major exports coffee cocoa and petroleum
 Export earnings were cut by almost onethird and inefficiencies in
 fiscal management were exposed In 199093 with support from the IMF
 and World Bank the government began to introduce reforms designed to
 spur business investment increase efficiency in agriculture and
 recapitalize the nations banks Political instability following
 suspect elections in 1992 brought IMFWB structural adjustment to a
 halt Although the 50 devaluation of the currency in January 1994
 improved the potential for export growth mismanagement remains and is
 the main barrier to economic improvement

CanadaEconomy

 Overview As an affluent hightech industrial society Canada today
 closely resembles the US in per capita output marketoriented
 economic system and pattern of production Since World War II the
 impressive growth of the manufacturing mining and service sectors
 has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one
 primarily industrial and urban In the 1980s Canada registered one of
 the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations averaging
 about 32 With its great natural resources skilled labor force and
 modern capital plant Canada has excellent economic prospects
 although the country still faces high unemployment and a growing debt
 Moreover the continuing constitutional impasse between English and
 Frenchspeaking areas has observers discussing a possible split in the
 confederation foreign investors have become edgy

Cape VerdeEconomy

 Overview Cape Verdes low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural
 resource base serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of
 longterm drought and a high birthrate The economy is service
 oriented with commerce transport and public services accounting for
 60 of GDP Although nearly 70 of the population lives in rural
 areas agricultures share of GDP is only 20 the fishing sector
 accounts for 4 About 90 of food must be imported The fishing
 potential mostly lobster and tuna is not fully exploited Cape Verde
 annually runs a high trade deficit financed by remittances from
 emigrants and foreign aid which form important supplements to GDP
 Economic reforms launched by the new democratic government in 1991
 are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting foreign
 investment to diversify the economy Prospects for 1995 depend heavily
 on the maintenance of aid flows remittances and the momentum of the
 governments development program

Central African RepublicEconomy

 Overview Subsistence agriculture together with forestry remains the
 backbone of the CAR economy with more than 70 of the population
 living in outlying areas The agricultural sector generates about half
 of GDP Timber has accounted for about 26 of export earnings and the
 diamond industry for 54 Important constraints to economic
 development include the CARs landlocked position a poor
 transportation system a largely unskilled work force and a legacy of
 misdirected macroeconomic policies A major plus is the large forest
 reserves which the government is moving to protect from
 overexploitation The 50 devaluation of the currencies of 14
 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed effects on
 CARs economy While diamond timber coffee and cotton exports
 increased  leading GDP to increase by 55  inflation rose to 40
 fueled by the rising prices of imports on which the economy depends
 CARs poor resource base and primitive infrastructure will keep it
 dependent on multilateral donors and France for the foreseeable
 future

ChadEconomy

 Overview Climate geographic remoteness poor resource endowment and
 lack of infrastructure make Chad one of the most underdeveloped
 countries in the world Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil
 conflict with Libya drought and food shortages Consequently the
 economy has shown little progress in recent years in overcoming a
 severe setback brought on by civil war in the late 1980s More than
 80 of the work force is involved in subsistence farming and fishing
 Cotton is the major cash crop accounting for at least half of
 exports Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid especially food
 credits given chronic shortages in several regions Of all the
 Francophone countries in Africa Chad has benefited the least from the
 50 devaluation of their currencies on 12 January 1994 Despite an
 increase in external financial aid and favorable price increases for
 cotton  the primary source of foreign exchange  the corrupt and
 enfeebled government bureaucracy continues to dampen economic
 enterprise by neglecting payments to domestic suppliers and public
 sector salaries Oil production in the Lake Chad area remains a
 distant prospect and the subsistencedriven economy probably will
 continue to limp along in the near term

ChileEconomy

 Overview Chile has a prosperous essentially free market economy
 with the degree of government intervention varying according to the
 philosophy of the different regimes Under the centerleft government
 of President AYLWIN which took power in March 1990 spending on
 social welfare rose steadily At the same time business investment
 exports and consumer spending also grew substantially The new
 president FREI who took office in March 1994 has emphasized social
 spending even more Growth in 199194 has averaged 65 annually with
 an estimated one million Chileans having moved out of poverty in the
 last four years Copper remains vital to the health of the economy
 Chile is the worlds largest producer and exporter of copper Success
 in meeting the governments goal of sustained annual growth of 5
 depends on world copper prices the level of confidence of foreign
 investors and creditors and the governments own ability to maintain
 a conservative fiscal stance

ChinaEconomy

 Overview Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been
 trying to move the economy from the sluggish Sovietstyle centrally
 planned economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market
 elements but still within the framework of monolithic Communist
 control To this end the authorities switched to a system of household
 responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization
 increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in
 industry permitted a wide variety of smallscale enterprise in
 services and light manufacturing and opened the economy to increased
 foreign trade and investment The result has been a strong surge in
 production particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s Industry
 also has posted major gains especially in coastal areas near Hong
 Kong and opposite Taiwan where foreign investment and modern
 production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and
 export goods Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978 On
 the darker side the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid
 system the worst results of socialism bureaucracy lassitude
 corruption and of capitalism windfall gains and steppedup
 inflation Beijing thus has periodically backtracked retightening
 central controls at intervals In 199294 annual growth of GDP
 accelerated particularly in the coastal areas  to more than 10
 annually according to official claims In late 1993 Chinas leadership
 approved additional longterm reforms aimed at giving more play to
 marketoriented institutions and at strengthening the centers control
 over the financial system In 1994 strong growth continued in the
 widening marketoriented areas of the economy At the same time the
 government struggled to a collect revenues due from provinces
 businesses and individuals b keep inflation within bounds c
 reduce extortion and other economic crimes and d keep afloat the
 large stateowned enterprises most of which had not participated in
 the vigorous expansion of the economy From 60 to 100 million surplus
 rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities many
 barely subsisting through parttime lowpay jobs Popular resistance
 changes in central policy and loss of authority by rural cadres have
 weakened Chinas population control program which is essential to the
 nations longterm economic viability One of the most dangerous
 longterm threats to continued rapid economic growth is the
 deterioration in the environment notably air pollution soil erosion
 and the steady fall of the water table especially in the north

 National product GDP  purchasing power parity  29788 trillion
 1994 estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992 by
 use of official Chinese growth statistics for 199394 because of the
 difficulties with official statistics in this time of rapid change
 the result may overstate Chinas GDP by as much as 25

ColombiaEconomy

 Overview Colombias economy has grown steadily since 1991 when the
 government implemented sweeping economic reform measures President
 SAMPER who took office in August 1994 has pledged to maintain those
 reforms while expanding government assistance for poor Colombians who
 continue to make up about 40 of the population In an effort to bring
 down inflation SAMPER has arranged a social pact with business and
 labor to curtail price hikes and trim inflation to 18 The rapid
 development of oil coal and other nontraditional industries along
 with copious inflows of capital and strengthening of prices for
 coffee have helped keep growth at 56 Development of the massive
 Cusiana oilfield provides the means to sustain this level over the
 next several years Exporters say however that their sales have been
 hampered by the appreciation of the Colombian peso and farmers have
 sought government help in adjusting to greater foreign competition
 Moreover increased foreign investment and even greater domestic
 growth have been hindered by an inadequate energy and transportation
 infrastructure and by violence stemming from drug trafficking and
 persistent rural insurgency

ComorosEconomy

 Overview One of the worlds poorest countries Comoros is made up of
 several islands that have poor transportation links a young and
 rapidly increasing population and few natural resources The low
 educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence
 level of economic activity high unemployment and a heavy dependence
 on foreign grants and technical assistance Agriculture including
 fishing hunting and forestry is the leading sector of the economy
 It contributes 40 to GDP employs 80 of the labor force and
 provides most of the exports The country is not selfsufficient in
 food production rice the main staple accounts for 90 of imports
 The government is struggling to upgrade education and technical
 training to privatize commercial and industrial enterprises to
 improve health services to diversify exports and to reduce the high
 population growth rate Continued foreign support is essential if the
 goal of 4 annual GDP growth is to be reached in the late 1990s

CongoEconomy

 Overview Congos economy is a mixture of village agriculture and
 handicrafts an industrial sector based largely on oil support
 services and a government characterized by budget problems and
 overstaffing A reform program supported by the IMF and World Bank
 ran into difficulties in 199091 because of problems in changing to a
 democratic political regime and a heavy debtservicing burden Oil has
 supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy providing about
 twothirds of government revenues and exports In the early 1980s
 rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to finance largescale
 development projects with growth averaging 5 annually one of the
 highest rates in Africa Subsequently growth has slowed to an average
 of roughly 15 annually only twothirds of the population growth
 rate Political turmoil and misguided government investment have
 derailed economic reform programs sponsored by the IMF and World Bank
 Even with these difficulties Congo enjoys one of the highest incomes
 per capita in subSaharan Africa

Cook IslandsEconomy

 Overview Agriculture provides the economic base The major export
 earners are fruit copra and clothing Manufacturing activities are
 limited to a fruitprocessing plant and several clothing factories
 Economic development is hindered by the isolation of the islands from
 foreign markets and a lack of natural resources and good
 transportation links A large trade deficit is annually made up for by
 remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid largely from New
 Zealand Current economic development plans call for exploiting the
 tourism potential and expanding the fishing industry

Cote DivoireEconomy

 Overview Cote dIvoire is among the worlds largest producers and
 exporters of coffee cocoa beans and palmkernel oil Consequently
 the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international
 prices for coffee and cocoa and to weather conditions Despite
 attempts by the government to diversify the economy is still largely
 dependent on agriculture and related industries After several years
 of lagging performance the Ivorian economy began a comeback in 1994
 due to improved prices for cocoa and coffee growth in nontraditional
 primary exports such as pineapples and rubber trade and banking
 liberalization offshore oil and gas discoveries and generous
 external financing and debt rescheduling by multilateral lenders and
 France The 50 devaluation in January 1994 caused a one time jump in
 the inflation rate Government adherence to a renewed structural
 adjustment program has led to a budget surplus for the first time in
 several years a smaller personnel budget and an increase in public
 investment While real growth in 1994 was only 15 the IMF and World
 Bank expect it will surpass 6 in 1995

CroatiaEconomy

 Overview Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia the republic of
 Croatia after Slovenia was the most prosperous and industrialized
 area with a per capita output perhaps onethird above the Yugoslav
 average At present Croatian Serb Separatists control approximately
 onethird of the Croatian territory and one of the overriding
 determinants of Croatias longterm political and economic prospects
 will be the resolution of this territorial dispute Croatia faces
 serious economic problems stemming from the legacy of longtime
 Communist mismanagement of the economy large foreign debt damage
 during the fighting to bridges factories power lines buildings and
 houses the large refugee population both Croatian and Bosnian and
 the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former
 Yugoslav republics as well as within its own territory At the
 minimum extensive Western aid and investment especially in the
 tourist and oil industries would seem necessary to revive the
 moribund economy However peace and political stability must come
 first only then will recent government moves toward a
 marketfriendly economy restore old levels of output As of February
 1995 fighting continues among Croats Serbs and Muslims and
 national boundaries and final political arrangements are still in
 doubt

CubaEconomy

 Overview Cubas heavily statist economy remains severely depressed as
 the result of its own inefficiencies and the loss of massive amounts
 of economic aid from the former Soviet Bloc Total output in 1994 was
 only about half the output of 1989 The fall in output and in imports
 is reflected in the deterioration of food supplies shortages of
 electricity inability to get spare parts and the replacement of
 motordriven vehicles by bicycles and draft animals Higher world
 market prices for sugar and nickel in 1994 however resulted in a
 slight increase in export earnings for the first time in six years
 despite lower production of both commodities The growth of tourism
 slowed in late 1994 as a result of negative publicity surrounding the
 exodus of Cubans from the island and other international factors The
 government continued its aggressive search for foreign investment and
 announced preliminary agreements to form large joint ventures with
 Mexican investors in telecommunications and oil refining In mid1994
 the National Assembly began introducing several new taxes and price
 increases to stem growing excess liquidity and restore some of the
 pesos value as a monetary instrument In October the government
 attempted to stimulate food production by permitting the sale of any
 surplus production over state quotas at unrestricted prices at
 designated markets Similar but much smaller markets were also
 introduced for the sale of manufactured goods in December The various
 government measures have influenced a remarkable appreciation of the
 black market value of the peso from more than 100 pesos to the dollar
 in September 1994 to 40 pesos to the dollar in early 1995 Policy
 discussions continue in the bureaucracy over the proper pace and scope
 of economic reform

CyprusEconomy

 Overview The Greek Cypriot economy is small diversified and
 prosperous Industry contributes 14 to GDP and employs 29 of the
 labor force while the service sector contributes 53 to GDP and
 employs 57 of the labor force An average 68 rise in real GDP
 between 1986 and 1990 was temporarily checked in 1991 because of the
 adverse effects of the Gulf war on tourism After surging 85 in
 1992 growth slowed to 20 in 1993  its lowest level in two decades
  because of the decline in tourist arrivals associated with the
 recession in Western Europe Cyprus main trading partner and the
 loss in export competitiveness due to a sharp rise in unit labor
 costs Real GDP is likely to have picked up in 1994 and inflation is
 estimated to have risen to between 5 and 6 The Turkish Cypriot
 economy has less than onethird the per capita GDP of the south
 Because it is recognized only by Turkey it has had much difficulty
 arranging foreign financing and foreign firms have hesitated to
 invest there The economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture
 which employs onequarter of the work force Moreover because the
 Turkish lira is legal tender the Turkish Cypriot economy has suffered
 the same high inflation as mainland Turkey The small vulnerable
 economy is estimated to have experienced a sharp drop in growth during
 1994 because of the severe economic crisis affecting the mainland To
 compensate for the economys weakness Turkey provides direct and
 indirect aid to nearly every sector financial support has risen in
 value to about onethird of Turkish Cypriot GDP

Czech RepublicEconomy

 Overview The government of the Czech Republic using successful
 stabilization policies to bolster its claims to full membership in the
 western economic community has reduced inflation to 10 kept
 unemployment at 3 balanced the budget run trade surpluses and
 reoriented exports to the EU since the breakup of the Czechoslovak
 federation on 1 January 1993 GDP grew 2 in 1994 after stagnating in
 1993 and contracting nearly 20 since 1990 Pragues mass
 privatization program including its innovative distribution of
 ownership shares to Czech citizens via coupon vouchers has made the
 most rapid progress in Eastern Europe When coupon shares are
 distributed in early 1995 7580 of the economy will be in private
 hands or partially privatized according to the Czech government
 Privatized companies still face major problems in restructuring the
 number of annual bankruptcies quadrupled in 1994 In September 1994
 Prague repaid 471 million in IMF loans five years ahead of schedule
 making the Czech Republic the first East European country to pay off
 all IMF debts Despite these outlays hardcurrency reserves in the
 banking system totaled more than 85 billion in October Standard 
 Poors boosted the Republics credit rating to BBB in mid1994  up
 from a BBB rating that was already two steps higher than Hungarys and
 one step above Greeces rating Prague forecasts a balanced budget at
 least 3 GDP growth 5 unemployment and singledigit inflation for
 1995 Inflationary pressures  primarily as a result of foreign bank
 lending to Czech enterprises but perhaps also due to eased currency
 convertibility controls  are likely to be the most troublesome issues
 in 1995 Continuing economic recovery in Western Europe should boost
 Czech exports and production but a substantial increase in prices
 could erode the Republics comparative advantage in low wages and
 exchange rates Prague already took steps in 1994 to increase control
 over banking policies to neutralize the impact of foreign inflows on
 the money supply Although Czech unemployment is currently the lowest
 in Central Europe it will probably increase 12 percentage points in
 1995 as large state firms go bankrupt or are restructured and service
 sector growth slows

DenmarkEconomy

 Overview This thoroughly modern economy features hightech
 agriculture uptodate smallscale and corporate industry extensive
 government welfare measures comfortable living standards and high
 dependence on foreign trade Denmark is selfsufficient in food
 production The new centerleft coalition government will concentrate
 on reducing the persistent high unemployment rate and the budget
 deficit as well as following the previous governments policies of
 maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus In the face
 of recent international market pressure on the Danish krone the
 coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency The coalition
 hopes to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax
 revenues boost industrial competitiveness through labor market and
 tax reforms and increased research and development funds and improve
 welfare services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays
 Prime Minister RASMUSSENs reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to
 the criteria for European integration by 1999 although Copenhagen has
 won from the European Union EU the right to opt out of the European
 Monetary Union EMU if a national referendum rejects it Denmark is
 in fact one of the few EU countries likely to fit into the EMU on
 time Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better than
 many West European countries After posting 45 real GDP growth in
 1994 Copenhagen is predicting a continued strong showing in 1995
 with real GDP up by 32 The government expects an upswing in
 business investment in 1995 to drive economic growth Although
 unemployment is high it remains stable compared to most European
 countries

DjiboutiEconomy

 Overview The economy is based on service activities connected with
 the countrys strategic location and status as a free trade zone in
 northeast Africa Twothirds of the inhabitants live in the capital
 city the remainder being mostly nomadic herders Scanty rainfall
 limits crop production to fruits and vegetables and most food must be
 imported Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the
 region and an international transshipment and refueling center It has
 few natural resources and little industry The nation is therefore
 heavily dependent on foreign assistance an important supplement to
 GDP to help support its balance of payments and to finance
 development projects An unemployment rate of over 30 continues to be
 a major problem Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35 over
 the last six years because of recession civil war and a high
 population growth rate including immigrants and refugees

Dominican RepublicEconomy

 Overview The Dominican economy showed some signs of slippage in 1994
 although its overall performance in recent years has been relatively
 strong After posting an increase of nearly 8 in 1992 GDP growth
 fell to 3 in 1993 and 1994 as mining output decreased and erosion of
 real wages caused private consumption to decline A preelection boost
 in government spending in early 1994 led to the first government
 deficit in four years and bumped inflation up to 14 for the year
 Continued dynamism in construction and the services sector especially
 tourism should keep the economy growing in 1995 Tourism
 agriculture and manufacturing for export remain key sectors of the
 economy Domestic industry is based on the processing of agricultural
 products oil refining and chemicals

EcuadorEconomy

 Overview Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural
 areas Growth has been uneven in recent years because of fluctuations
 in prices for Ecuadors primary exports  oil and bananas  as well as
 because of government policies designed to curb inflation President
 Sixto DURANBALLEN launched a series of macroeconomic reforms when he
 came into office in August 1992 which included raising domestic fuel
 prices and utility rates eliminating most subsidies and bringing the
 government budget into balance These measures helped to reduce
 inflation from 55 in 1992 to 25 in 1994 DURANBALLEN has a much
 more favorable attitude toward foreign investment than his predecessor
 and has supported several laws designed to encourage foreign
 investment Ecuador has implemented free or complementary trade
 agreements with Bolivia Chile Colombia Peru and Venezuela as well
 as applied for World Trade Organization membership Ecuador signed a
 standby agreement with the IMF and rescheduled its 76 billion
 commercial debt in 1994 thereby regaining access to multilateral
 lending Growth in 1994 speeded up to 39 based on increased exports
 of bananas and nontraditional products while international reserves
 increased to a record 16 billion

EgyptEconomy

 Overview Half of Egypts GDP originates in the public sector most
 industrial plants being owned by the government Overregulation holds
 back technical modernization and foreign investment Even so the
 economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s but in
 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden
 of debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
 balanceofpayments support Egypts first IMF standby arrangement
 concluded in mid1987 was suspended in early 1988 because of the
 governments failure to adopt promised reforms Egypt signed a
 followon program with the IMF and also negotiated a structural
 adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991 In 199193 the government
 made solid progress on administrative reforms such as liberalizing
 exchange and interest rates but resisted implementing major structural
 reforms like streamlining the public sector As a result the economy
 has not gained momentum and unemployment has become a growing problem
 Egypt probably will continue making uneven progress in implementing
 the successor programs with the IMF and World Bank it signed onto in
 late 1993 Tourism has plunged since 1992 because of sporadic attacks
 by Islamic extremists on tourist groups President MUBARAK has cited
 population growth as the main cause of the countrys economic
 troubles The addition of about 12 million people a year to the
 already huge population of 62 million exerts enormous pressure on the
 5 of the land area available for agriculture along the Nile

Equatorial GuineaEconomy

 Overview Agriculture forestry and fishing account for about half of
 GDP and nearly all exports Subsistence farming predominates Although
 preindependence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for
 hard currency earnings the deterioration of the rural economy under
 successive brutal regimes has diminished potential for agricultureled
 growth A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the
 international donor community have failed to revitalize export
 agriculture Businesses for the most part are owned by government
 officials and their family members Commerce accounts for about 8 of
 GDP and the construction public works and service sectors for about
 38 Undeveloped natural resources include titanium iron ore
 manganese uranium and alluvial gold Oil exploration taking place
 under concessions offered to US French and Spanish firms has been
 moderately successful Increased production from recently discovered
 natural gas fields will provide a greater share of exports in 1995

EritreaEconomy

 Overview With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993 Eritrea
 faces the bitter economic problems of a small desperately poor
 African country Most of the population will continue to depend on
 subsistence farming Domestic output is substantially augmented by
 worker remittances from abroad Government revenues come from custom
 duties and income and sales taxes Eritrea has inherited the entire
 coastline of Ethiopia and has longterm prospects for revenues from
 the development of offshore oil offshore fishing and tourism For
 the time being Ethiopia will be largely dependent on Eritrean ports
 for its foreign trade

 into Western Europe the Estonian government has pursued an ambitious
 program of market reforms and stabilization measures which is rapidly
 transforming the economy Three years after independence  and two

 reap tangible benefits inflation though still high was brought down
 to about 2 per month in second half 1994 production declines have
 bottomed out with estimated growth of 4 in 1994 and living standards
 are rising Economic restructuring has been dramatic By 1994 the
 service sector accounted for over 55 of GDP while the oncedominant
 heavy industrial sector continues to shrink The private sector is
 growing rapidly the share of the state enterprises in the economy has
 steadily declined and by late 1994 accounted for only about 40 of

EthiopiaEconomy

 Overview With the independence of Eritrea on 27 April 1993 Ethiopia
 continues to face difficult economic problems as one of the poorest
 and least developed countries in Africa Its economy is based on
 agriculture which accounts for about 45 of GDP 90 of exports and
 80 of total employment coffee generates 60 of export earnings The
 agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought poor
 cultivation practices and deterioration of internal security
 conditions The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
 from the agricultural sector Over 90 of largescale industry but
 less than 10 of agriculture is state run The government is
 considering selling off a portion of stateowned plants and is
 implementing reform measures that are gradually liberalizing the
 economy A major mediumterm problem is the improvement of roads
 water supply and other parts of an infrastructure badly neglected
 during years of civil strife

Falkland Islands islas MalvinasEconomy

 Overview The economy was formerly based on agriculture mainly sheep
 farming which directly or indirectly employs most of the work force
 Dairy farming supports domestic consumption crops furnish winter
 fodder Exports feature shipments of highgrade wool to the UK and the
 sale of postage stamps and coins Rich stocks of fish in the
 surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders So
 far efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been
 unsuccessful The economy has diversified since 1987 when the
 government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
 operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone These license
 fees total more than 40 million per year and support the islands
 health education and welfare system To encourage tourism the
 Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges for
 visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing The
 islands are now selffinancing except for defense The British
 Geological Survey announced a 200mile oil exploration zone around the
 islands in 1993 and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves
 capable of producing 500000 barrels per day

Faroe IslandsEconomy

 Overview The Faroese who have long enjoyed the affluent living
 standards of the Danes and other Scandinavians now must cope with the
 decline of the allimportant fishing industry and one of the worlds
 heaviest per capita external debts of about 25000 When the nations
 of the world extended their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the
 early 1970s the Faroese no longer could continue their traditional
 longdistance fishing and subsequently depleted their own nearby
 fishing areas The governments tight controls on fish stocks and its
 austerity measures have caused a recession and subsidy cuts will
 force nationalization in the fishing industry which has already been
 plagued with bankruptcies Copenhagen has threatened to withhold its
 annual subsidy of 130 million  roughly onethird of the islands
 budget revenues  unless the Faroese make significant efforts to
 balance their budget To this extent the Faroe government is expected
 to continue its tough policies including introducing a 20
 valueadded tax VAT in 1993 and has agreed to an IMF
 economicpolitical stabilization plan In addition to its annual
 subsidy the Danish government has bailed out the second largest Faroe
 bank to the tune of 140 million since October 1992

FijiEconomy

 Overview Fijis economy is primarily agricultural with a large
 subsistence sector Sugar exports and tourism are the major sources of
 foreign exchange Industry contributes 13 to GDP with sugar
 processing accounting for onethird of industrial activity Roughly
 250000 tourists visit each year Political uncertainty and drought
 however contribute to substantial fluctuations in earnings from
 tourism and sugar and to the emigration of skilled workers In 1992
 growth was approximately 3 based on growth in tourism and a
 lessening of labormanagement disputes in the sugar and goldmining
 sectors In 1993 the governments budgeted growth rate of 3 was not
 achieved because of a decline in nonsugar agricultural output and
 damage from Cyclone Kina Growth in 1994 is estimated to be 5
 largely attributed to increased tourism and expansion in domestic
 production particularly in the manufacturing sector

FinlandEconomy

 Overview Finland has a highly industrialized largely free market
 economy with per capita output twothirds of the US figure Its key
 economic sector is manufacturing  principally the wood metals and
 engineering industries Trade is important with the export of goods
 representing about 30 of GDP Except for timber and several minerals
 Finland depends on imports of raw materials energy and some
 components for manufactured goods Because of the climate
 agricultural development is limited to maintaining selfsufficiency in
 basic products Forestry an important export earner provides a
 secondary occupation for the rural population The economy which
 experienced an average of 49 annual growth between 1987 and 1989
 sank into deep recession in 1991 as GDP contracted by 65 The
 recession  which continued in 1992 with GDP contracting by 41  has
 been caused by economic overheating depressed foreign markets and
 the dismantling of the barter system between Finland and the former
 Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and gas had been exchanged for
 Finnish manufactured goods The Finnish Government has proposed
 efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and efficiency by an
 increase in exports to Western markets cuts in public expenditures
 partial privatization of state enterprises and changes in monetary
 policy In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka to the European
 Unions EU European Currency Unit ECU to promote stability
 Ongoing speculation resulting from a lack of confidence in the
 governments policies forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by about
 12 in November 1991 and to indefinitely break the link in September
 1992 The devaluations have boosted the competitiveness of Finnish
 exports The recession bottomed out in 1993 and Finland participated
 in the general European upturn of 1994 Unemployment probably will
 remain a serious problem during the next few years the majority of
 Finnish firms face a weak domestic market and the troubled German and
 Swedish export markets The Finns voted in an October 1994 referendum
 to enter the EU and Finland officially joined the Union on 1 January
 1995 Increasing integration with Western Europe will dominate the
 economic picture over the next few years

FranceEconomy

 Overview One of the worlds most highly developed economies France
 has substantial agricultural resources and a diversified modern
 industrial sector Large tracts of fertile land the application of
 modern technology and subsidies have combined to make it the leading
 agricultural producer in Western Europe Largely selfsufficient in
 agricultural products France is a major exporter of wheat and dairy
 products The industrial sector generates about onequarter of GDP
 and the growing services sector has become crucial to the economy
 Following stagnation and recession in 199193 French GDP in 1994
 expanded 24 Growth in 1995 is expected to be in the 30 to 35
 range Persistently high unemployment will still pose a major problem
 for the government Paris remains committed to maintaining the
 francdeutsche mark parity which has kept French interest rates high
 despite Frances low inflation Although the pace of economic and
 financial integration within the European Union has slowed down
 integration presumably will remain a major force shaping the fortunes
 of the various economic sectors over the next few years

French GuianaEconomy

 Overview The economy is tied closely to that of France through
 subsidies and imports Besides the French space center at Kourou
 fishing and forestry are the most important economic activities with
 exports of fish and fish products mostly shrimp accounting for more
 than 60 of total revenue in 1992 The large reserves of tropical
 hardwoods not fully exploited support an expanding sawmill industry
 that provides sawn logs for export Cultivation of crops  rice
 cassava bananas and sugarcane  is limited to the coastal area
 where the population is largely concentrated French Guiana is heavily
 dependent on imports of food and energy Unemployment is a serious
 problem particularly among younger workers

GabonEconomy

 Overview Notwithstanding its serious ongoing economic problems Gabon
 enjoys a per capita income more than twice that of most nations of
 subSaharan Africa Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil
 was discovered offshore in the early 1970s The oil sector now
 accounts for 50 of GDP Real growth was feeble in 1992 and Gabon
 continues to face the problem of fluctuating prices for its oil
 timber manganese and uranium exports Despite an abundance of
 natural wealth and a manageable rate of population growth the
 economy is hobbled by poor fiscal management In 1992 the fiscal
 deficit widened to 24 of GDP and Gabon failed to settle arrears on
 its bilateral debt leading to a cancellation of rescheduling
 agreements with official and private creditors Devaluation of its
 Francophone currency by 50 in January 1994 did not set off an
 expected inflationary spiral but the government must continue to keep
 a tight reign on spending and wage increases

The GambiaEconomy

 Overview The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural
 resources and has a limited agricultural base About 75 of the
 population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising which
 contribute 30 to GDP Smallscale manufacturing activity  processing
 peanuts fish and hides  accounts for less than 10 of GDP A
 sustained structural adjustment program including a liberalized trade
 policy had fostered a respectable 4 rate of growth in recent years
 Reexport trade constitutes onethird of economic activity however
 border closures associated with Senegals monetary crisis in late 1993
 led to a halving of reexport trade reducing government revenues in
 turn The 50 devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has made
 Senegalese goods more competitive and apparently prompted a relaxation
 of Senegalese controls paving the way for a comeback in reexports
 But overwhelming these developments were the devastating effects of
 the militarys takeover in July 1994 By October traffic at the Port
 of Banjul had fallen precipitously as importers nervously scaled back
 their activities with the commencement of the anticorruption drive by
 the new regime Concerned with the growing potential for serious
 unrest after a countercoup attempt was bloodily put down by the
 regime the United Kingdom and the EU in November issued a travelers
 advisory for The Gambia which brought a halt to tourism almost
 immediately The Gambia faces additional problems in 1995 if as is
 likely economic sanctions by Western governments remain in effect in
 response to indications that the military regime intends to stay in
 power far longer than expected by the donors

 Overview In 1991 roughly 40 of Gaza Strip workers were employed
 across the border by Israeli industrial construction and
 agricultural enterprises with worker remittances supplementing GDP by
 roughly 50 Gaza depends upon Israel for nearly 90 of its external
 trade Aggravating the impact of Israeli military administration
 unrest in the territory since 1988 intifadah has raised unemployment
 and lowered the standard of living of Gazans The Persian Gulf crisis
 and its aftershocks also have dealt blows to Gaza since August 1990
 Worker remittances from the Gulf states have dropped unemployment has
 increased and exports have fallen The withdrawal of Israel from the
 Gaza Strip in May 1994 brings a new set of adjustment problems

 NoteGeorgia has been beset by ethnic and civil strife since
 independence In late 1991 the countrys first elected president
 Zviad GAMSAKHURDIA was ousted in an armed coup In October 1993
 GAMSAKHURDIA and his supporters sponsored a failed attempt to retake
 power from the current government led by former Soviet Foreign
 Minister Eduard SHEVARDNADZE The Georgian government has also faced
 armed separatist conflicts in the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions
 A ceasefire went into effect in South Ossetia in June 1992 and a
 joint GeorgianOssetianRussian peacekeeping force has been in place
 since that time Georgian forces were driven out of the Abkhaz region
 in September 1993 after a yearlong war with Abkhaz separatists Nearly
 200000 Georgian refugees have since fled Abkhazia adding
 substantially to the estimated 100000 internally displaced persons
 already in Georgia Russian peacekeepers are deployed along the border
 of Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia

GeorgiaEconomy

 Overview Georgias economy has traditionally revolved around Black
 Sea tourism cultivation of citrus fruits tea and grapes mining of
 manganese and copper and a small industrial sector producing wine
 metals machinery chemicals and textiles The country imports the
 bulk of its energy needs including natural gas and oil products Its
 only sizable domestic energy resource is hydropower Since 1990
 widespread conflicts eg in Abkhazia South Ossetia and
 Mingreliya have severely aggravated the economic crisis resulting
 from the disintegration of the Soviet command economy in December
 1991 Throughout 1993 and 1994 much of industry was functioning at
 only 20 of capacity heavy disruptions in agricultural cultivation
 were reported and tourism was shut down The country is precariously
 dependent on US and EU humanitarian grain shipments as most other
 foods are priced beyond reach of the average citizen Georgia is also
 suffering from an acute energy crisis as it is having problems paying
 for even minimal imports Georgia is pinning its hopes for recovery on
 reestablishing trade ties with Russia and on developing international
 transportation through the key Black Sea ports of Poti and Batumi
 The government began a tenuous program in 1994 aiming to stabilize
 prices and reduce large consumer subsidies

 clearly visible yet the eastern region almost certainly will remain
 dependent on subsidies funded by western Germany until well into the
 next century The staggering 390 billion in western German assistance
 that the eastern states have received since 1990  40 times the amount
 in real terms of US Marshall Fund aid sent to West Germany after World
 War II  is just beginning to have an impact on the eastern German
 standard of living which plummeted after unification Assistance to
 the east continues to run at roughly 100 billion annually Although
 the growth rate in the east was much greater than in the west in
 199394 eastern GDP per capita nonetheless remains well below
 preunification levels it will take 1015 years for the eastern states
 to match western Germanys living standards The economic recovery in
 the east is led by the construction industries which account for
 onethird of industrial output with growth increasingly supported by
 the service sectors and light manufacturing industries Eastern
 Germanys economy is changing from one anchored on manufacturing to a
 more serviceoriented economy Western Germany with three times the
 per capita output of the eastern states has an advanced market
 economy and is a world leader in exports The strong recovery in 1994
 from recession began in the export sector and spread to the investment
 and consumption sectors in response to falling interest rates Western
 Germany has a highly urbanized and skilled population that enjoys
 excellent living standards abundant leisure time and comprehensive
 social welfare benefits It is relatively poor in natural resources
 coal being the most important mineral Western Germanys worldclass
 companies manufacture technologically advanced goods The regions
 economy is mature services and manufacturing account for the dominant
 share of economic activities and raw materials and semimanufactured
 goods constitute a large portion of imports

GhanaEconomy

 Overview Well endowed with natural resources Ghana is relatively
 well off having twice the per capita output of the poorer countries
 in West Africa Heavily reliant on international assistance Ghana has
 made steady progress in liberalizing its economy since 1983 Overall
 growth continued at a rate of approximately 5 in 1994 due largely to
 increased gold timber and cocoa production  major sources of
 foreign exchange The economy however continues to revolve around
 subsistence agriculture which accounts for 45 of GDP and employs 55
 of the work force mainly small landholders Public sector wage
 increases regional peacekeeping commitments and the containment of
 internal unrest in the underdeveloped north have placed substantial
 demands on the governments budget and have led to inflationary
 deficit financing and a 27 depreciation of the cedi in 1994

GreeceEconomy

 Overview Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the basic
 entrepreneurial system overlaid in 198189 by a socialist system that
 enlarged the public sector from 55 of GDP in 1981 to about 70 in
 1989 Since then the public sector has been reduced to about 60 of
 GDP Tourism continues as a major source of foreign exchange and
 agriculture is selfsufficient except for meat dairy products and
 animal feedstuffs Over the last decade real GDP growth has averaged
 16 a year compared with the European Union average of 22
 Inflation continues to be well above the EU average and the national
 debt has reached 140 of GDP the highest in the EU Prime Minister
 PAPANDREOU will probably make only limited progress correcting the
 economys problems of high inflation large budget deficit and
 decaying infrastructure His economic program suggests that although
 he will shun his expansionary policies of the 1980s he will avoid
 tough measures needed to slow inflation or reduce the states role in
 the economy He has limited the previous governments privatization
 plans for example and has called for generous welfare spending and
 real wage increases Athens continues to rely heavily on EU aid which
 recently has amounted to about 6 of GDP Greece almost certainly will
 not meet the EUs Maastricht Treaty convergence targets of public
 deficit held to 3 of GDP and national debt to 60 of GDP by 1999 Per
 capita GDP has fallen below Portugals level the lowest among EU
 members

GreenlandEconomy

 Overview Greenlands economic situation at present is difficult
 Unemployment is increasing and prospects for economic growth in the
 immediate future are dim Following the closing of the Black Angel
 lead and zinc mine in 1989 Greenland became almost completely
 dependent on fishing and fish processing the sector accounting for
 95 of exports Prospects for fisheries are not bright as the
 important shrimp catches will at best stabilize and cod catches have
 dropped Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon activities is not around
 the corner thus leaving only tourism with some potential for the near
 future The public sector in Greenland ie the central government
 and its commercial entities and the municipalities plays a dominant
 role in Greenland accounting for about twothirds of total employment
 About half the governments revenues come from grants from the Danish
 Government

GuadeloupeEconomy

 Overview The economy depends on agriculture tourism light industry
 and services It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and
 imports Tourism is a key industry with most tourists from the US In
 addition an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the
 islands The traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being
 replaced by other crops such as bananas which now supply about 50
 of export earnings eggplant and flowers Other vegetables and root
 crops are cultivated for local consumption although Guadeloupe is
 still dependent on imported food which comes mainly from France
 Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production Most
 manufactured goods and fuel are imported Unemployment is especially
 high among the young

GuamEconomy

 Overview The economy depends mainly on US military spending and on
 revenues from tourism Over the past 20 years the tourist industry has
 grown rapidly creating a construction boom for new hotels and the
 expansion of older ones Visitors numbered about 900000 in 1992 The
 slowdown in Japanese economic growth has been reflected in less
 vigorous growth in the tourism sector About 60 of the labor force
 works for the private sector and the rest for government Most food
 and industrial goods are imported with about 75 from the US Guam
 faces the problem of building up the civilian economic sector to
 offset the impact of military downsizing

GuineaEconomy

 Overview GuineaBissau ranks among the poorest countries in the
 world Agriculture and fishing are the main economic activities
 Cashew nuts peanuts and palm kernels are the primary exports
 Exploitation of known mineral deposits is unlikely at present because
 of a weak infrastructure and the high cost of development With IMF
 support the country is committed to an economic reform program
 emphasizing monetary stability and private sector growth This process
 will continue at a slow pace because of a heavy foreign debt burden
 and internal constraints

GuyanaEconomy

 Overview Guyana one of the poorest countries in the Western
 Hemisphere has pushed ahead strongly in 199294 with an 8 average
 annual economic growth rate led by gold mining and rice sugar and
 forestry products for export Favorable factors include recovery in
 the key agricultural and mining sectors a more favorable atmosphere
 for business initiative a more realistic exchange rate a sharp drop
 in the inflation rate and the continued support of international
 organizations Serious underlying economic problems will continue
 Electric power has been in short supply and constitutes a major
 barrier to future gains in national output The government will have
 to persist in efforts to manage its large 22 billion external debt
 control inflation and to extend the privatization program

HaitiEconomy

 Overview About 75 of the population live in abject poverty
 Agriculture is mainly smallscale subsistence farming and employs
 twothirds of the work force The majority of the population does not
 have ready access to safe drinking water adequate medical care or
 sufficient food The lack of employment opportunities remains one of
 the most critical problems facing the economy along with soil erosion
 and political instability International trade sanctions in response
 to the September 1991 coup against President ARISTIDE further damaged
 the economy The restoration of President ARISTIDE the lifting of
 sanctions in late 1994 and foreign aid will alleviate some economic
 problems Haiti will continue to depend heavily on foreign aid

Hong KongEconomy

 Overview Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few
 tariffs or nontariff barriers Natural resources are limited and food
 and raw materials must be imported Manufacturing accounts for about
 17 of GDP Goods and services exports account for about 50 of GDP
 Real GDP growth averaged a remarkable 8 in 198788 slowed to 30 in
 198990 and picked up to 42 in 1991 50 in 1992 52 in 1993
 and 55 in 1994 Unemployment which has been declining since the
 mid1980s is now about 2 A shortage of labor continues to put
 upward pressure on prices and the cost of living Prospects for
 199596 remain bright so long as major trading partners continue to be
 reasonably prosperous and so long as investors feel China will support
 free market practices after the takeover in 1997

HungaryEconomy

 Overview Since 1989 Hungary has been a leader in the transition from
 a socialist command economy to a market economy  thanks in large part
 to its initial economic reforms during the Communist era The private
 sector now accounts for about 55 of GDP Nonetheless the
 transformation is proving difficult and many citizens say life was
 better under the old system On the bright side the fouryear decline
 in output finally ended in 1994 as real GDP increased an estimated
 3 This growth helped reduce unemployment to just over 10 by
 yearend down from a peak of 13 However no progress was made
 against inflation which remained stuck at about 20 and the
 alreadylarge current account deficit in the balance of payments
 actually got worse reaching almost 4 billion Underlying Hungarys
 other economic problems is the large budget deficit which probably
 exceeded 7 of GDP in 1994 despite some lateyear budget cutting by
 the new leftist government In 1995 the government has pledged to
 accelerate privatization and lower the budget deficit to 55 of GDP
 It believes this fiscal tightening will reduce the current account
 deficit to 25 billion but at the cost of holding economic growth to
 only 1

IcelandEconomy

 Overview Icelands Scandinaviantype economy is basically
 capitalistic but with an extensive welfare system relatively low
 unemployment and comparatively even distribution of income The
 economy is heavily dependent on the fishing industry which provides
 nearly 75 of export earnings and employs 12 of the work force In
 the absence of other natural resources  except energy  Icelands
 economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices The economy in
 recession since 1988 began to recover in 1993 posting 04 growth
 but was still hampered by cutbacks in fish quotas as well as falling
 world prices for its main exports fish and fish products aluminum
 and ferrosilicon Real GDP grew by perhaps 24 in 1994 The
 centerright government plans to continue its policies of reducing the
 budget and current account deficits limiting foreign borrowing
 containing inflation revising agricultural and fishing policies
 diversifying the economy and privatizing stateowned industries The
 government however remains divided on the issue of EU membership
 primarily because of Icelanders concern about losing control over
 their fishing resources

IndiaEconomy

 Overview Indias economy is a mixture of traditional village farming
 modern agriculture handicrafts a wide range of modern industries
 and a multitude of support services Faster economic growth in the
 1980s permitted a significant increase in real per capita private
 consumption A large share of the population perhaps as much as 40
 remains too poor to afford an adequate diet Financial strains in 1990
 and 1991 prompted government austerity measures that slowed industrial
 growth but permitted India to meet its international payment
 obligations without rescheduling its debt Production trade and
 investment reforms since 1991 have provided new opportunities for
 Indian businessmen and an estimated 100 million to 200 million middle
 class consumers New Delhi has always paid its foreign debts on
 schedule and has stimulated exports attracted foreign investment and
 revived confidence in Indias economic prospects Foreign exchange
 reserves precariously low three years ago now total more than 19
 billion Positive factors for the remainder of the 1990s are Indias
 strong entrepreneurial class and the central governments recognition
 of the continuing need for marketoriented approaches to economic
 development for example in upgrading the wholly inadequate
 communications facilities Negative factors include the desperate
 poverty of hundreds of millions of Indians and the impact of the huge
 and expanding population on an already overloaded environment

IndonesiaEconomy

 Overview Indonesia is a mixed economy with some socialist
 institutions and central planning but with a recent emphasis on
 deregulation and private enterprise Indonesia has extensive natural
 wealth yet with a large and rapidly increasing population it
 remains a rather poor country Real GDP growth in 198594 averaged
 about 6 quite impressive but not sufficient to both slash
 underemployment and absorb the 23 million workers annually entering
 the labor force Agriculture including forestry and fishing is an
 important sector accounting for 21 of GDP and over 50 of the labor
 force The staple crop is rice Once the worlds largest rice
 importer Indonesia is now nearly selfsufficient Plantation crops 
 rubber and palm oil  and textiles and plywood are being encouraged
 for both export and job generation Industrial output now accounts for
 almost 40 of GDP and is based on a supply of diverse natural
 resources including crude oil natural gas timber metals and coal
 Foreign investment has also boosted manufacturing output and exports
 in recent years Indeed the economys growth is highly dependent on
 the continuing expansion of nonoil exports Japan remains Indonesias
 most important customer and supplier of aid Rapid growth in the money
 supply in 198990 prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary
 policy in 1991 forcing the private sector to go to foreign banks for
 investment financing Real interest rates remained above 10 and
 offshore commercial debt grew The growth in offshore debt prompted
 Jakarta to limit foreign borrowing beginning in late 1991 Despite the

 has faced increasingly severe financial difficulties since mid1992

 mismanagement At yearend 1993 the Iranian Government estimated that
 it owed foreign creditors about 30 billion an estimated 8 billion
 of this debt was in arrears At yearend 1994 Iran rescheduled 12
 billion in debt Earnings from oil exports  which provide 90 of

IraqEconomy

 Overview The Bathist regime engages in extensive central planning
 and management of industrial production and foreign trade while
 leaving some smallscale industry and services and most agriculture to
 private enterprise The economy has been dominated by the oil sector
 which has traditionally provided about 95 of foreign exchange
 earnings In the 1980s financial problems caused by massive
 expenditures in the eightyear war with Iran and damage to oil export
 facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures
 and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments
 After the end of hostilities in 1988 oil exports gradually increased
 with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged
 facilities Agricultural development remained hampered by labor
 shortages salinization and dislocations caused by previous land
 reform and collectivization programs The industrial sector although
 accorded high priority by the government also was under financial
 constraints Iraqs seizure of Kuwait in August 1990 subsequent
 international economic embargoes and military action by an
 international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically changed
 the economic picture Industrial and transportation facilities which
 suffered severe damage have been partially restored Oil exports
 remain at less than 5 of the previous level Shortages of spare parts
 continue Living standards deteriorated even further in 1993 and 1994
 consumer prices have more than doubled in both 1993 and 1994 The
 UNsponsored economic embargo has reduced exports and imports and has
 contributed to the sharp rise in prices The Iraqi government has been
 unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so that the economic embargo can
 be removed The governments policies of supporting large military and
 internal security forces and of allocating resources to key supporters
 of the regime have exacerbated shortages In brief per capita output
 in 199394 is far below the 198990 level but no precise estimate is
 available

IrelandEconomy

 Overview The economy is small and trade dependent Agriculture once
 the most important sector is now dwarfed by industry which accounts
 for 37 of GDP about 80 of exports and employs 28 of the labor
 force Although exports remain the primary engine for Irelands robust
 growth the economy is also benefiting from a rise in consumer
 spending and recovery in both construction and business investment
 Ireland has substantially reduced its external debt since 1987 to 40
 of GDP in 1994 Over the same period inflation has fallen sharply and
 chronic trade deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses
 Unemployment remains a serious problem however and job creation is
 the main focus of government policy To ease unemployment Dublin
 aggressively courts foreign investors and recently created a new
 industrial development agency to aid small indigenous firms
 Government assistance is constrained by Dublins continuing deficit
 reduction measures

IsraelEconomy

 Overview Israel has a market economy with substantial government
 participation It depends on imports of crude oil grains raw
 materials and military equipment Despite limited natural resources
 Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial
 sectors over the past 20 years Industry employs about 22 of Israeli
 workers construction 65 agriculture forestry and fishing 35
 and services most of the rest Israel is largely selfsufficient in
 food production except for grains Diamonds hightechnology
 equipment and agricultural products fruits and vegetables are
 leading exports Israel usually posts current account deficits which
 are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign
 loans Roughly half of the governments external debt is owed to the
 United States which is its major source of economic and military aid
 To earn needed foreign exchange Israel has been targeting
 hightechnology niches in international markets such as medical
 scanning equipment The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former
 USSR which topped 450000 during the period 199094 increased
 unemployment intensified housing problems and strained the
 government budget At the same time the immigrants bring to the
 economy valuable scientific and professional expertise

ItalyEconomy

 Overview Since World War II the Italian economy has changed from one
 based on agriculture into a ranking industrial economy with
 approximately the same total and per capita output as France and the
 UK The country is still divided into a developed industrial north
 dominated by private companies and an undeveloped agricultural south
 dominated by large public enterprises Services account for 48 of
 GDP industry 35 agriculture 4 and public administration 13 Most
 raw materials needed by industry and over 75 of energy requirements
 must be imported After growing at an average annual rate of 3 in
 198390 growth slowed to about 1 in 1991 and 1992 fell by 07 in
 1993 and recovered to 2 in 1994 In the second half of 1992 Rome
 became unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying to participate in
 EU plans for economic and monetary union later in the decade thus it
 finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances Subsequently the
 government has adopted fairly stringent budgets abandoned its highly
 inflationary wage indexation system and started to scale back its
 extremely generous social welfare programs including pension and
 health care benefits Monetary officials were forced to withdraw the
 lira from the European monetary system in September 1992 when it came
 under extreme pressure in currency markets For the 1990s Italy faces
 the problems of pushing ahead with fiscal reform refurbishing a
 tottering communications system curbing pollution in major industrial
 centers and adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the
 ongoing expansion and economic integration of the European Union

JapanEconomy

 Overview Governmentindustry cooperation a strong work ethic
 mastery of high technology and a comparatively small defense
 allocation roughly 1 of GDP have helped Japan advance with
 extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second most powerful economy in
 the world Industry the most important sector of the economy is
 heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels Usually
 selfsufficient in rice Japan must import about 50 of its
 requirements of other grain and fodder crops Japan maintains one of
 the worlds largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15 of the
 global catch Overall economic growth has been spectacular a 10
 average in the 1960s a 5 average in the 1970s and 1980s Economic
 growth came to a halt in 199293 largely because of contractionary
 domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the
 stock and real estate markets Growth resumed at a 06 pace in 1994
 largely because of consumer demand As for foreign trade the stronger
 yen and slower global growth are containing export growth
 Unemployment and inflation remain remarkably low in comparison with
 the other industrialized nations Japan continues to run a huge trade
 surplus  121 billion in 1994 roughly the same size as in 1993 
 which supports extensive investment in foreign assets Prime Minister
 MURAYAMA has yet to formalize his governments plans for
 administrative and economic reform including reduction in the trade
 surplus As leader of a coalition government he has softened his own
 socialist positions The crowding of the habitable land area and the
 aging of the population are two major longrun problems

 Overview The economy is based largely on financial services
 agriculture and tourism Potatoes cauliflower tomatoes and
 especially flowers are important export crops shipped mostly to the
 UK The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents
 an important export earner Milk products go to the UK and other EU
 countries In 1986 the finance sector overtook tourism as the main
 contributor to GDP accounting for 40 of the islands output In
 recent years the government has encouraged light industry to locate in
 Jersey with the result that an electronics industry has developed
 alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear All raw material
 and energy requirements are imported as well as a large share of

JordanEconomy

 Overview Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom
 of the late 1970s and early 1980s when its annual real GNP growth
 averaged more than 10 In the remainder of the 1980s however
 reductions in both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real
 economic growth to an average of roughly 2 per year Imports  mainly
 oil capital goods consumer durables and food  outstripped exports
 with the difference covered by aid remittances and borrowing In
 mid1989 the Jordanian Government began debtrescheduling
 negotiations and agreed to implement an IMFsupported program designed
 to gradually reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed
 structural reforms The Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990
 however aggravated Jordans already serious economic problems
 forcing the government to shelve the IMF program stop most debt
 payments and suspend rescheduling negotiations Aid from Gulf Arab
 states worker remittances and trade contracted and refugees flooded
 the country producing serious balanceofpayments problems stunting
 GDP growth and straining government resources The economy rebounded
 in 1992 largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers
 returning from the Gulf but the recovery was uneven throughout 1994
 The government is implementing the reform program adopted in 1992 and
 continues to secure rescheduling and writeoffs of its heavy foreign
 debt Debt poverty and unemployment remain Jordans biggest ongoing
 problems

 pollution is severe in some cities because the two main rivers which
 flowed into the Aral Sea have been diverted for irrigation it is
 drying up and leaving behind a harmful layer of chemical pesticides

KazakhstanEconomy

 Overview Kazakhstan the second largest of the former Soviet states
 in territory possesses enormous untapped fossilfuel reserves as well
 as plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals It also has
 considerable agricultural potential with its vast steppe lands
 accommodating both livestock and grain production Kazakhstans
 industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these
 natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building
 sector specializing in construction equipment tractors agricultural
 machinery and some defense items The breakup of the USSR and the
 collapse of demand for Kazakhstans traditional heavy industry
 products have resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy since
 1991 with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994 The
 government has pursued a moderate program of economic reform and
 privatization which is gradually lifting state controls over economic
 activity and shifting assets into the private sector Nevertheless
 government control over key sectors of the economy remains strong
 Sustained economic hardships and continued pressures from industrial
 elites will make it difficult for the government to sustain its
 policies of monetary and fiscal discipline which had brought down
 inflation by the end of 1994 Continued lack of pipeline
 transportation for expanded oil exports has closed off a likely source
 of economic recovery

KiribatiEconomy

 Overview A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls Kiribati has
 few national resources Commercially viable phosphate deposits were
 exhausted at the time of independence in 1979 Copra and fish now
 represent the bulk of production and exports The economy has
 fluctuated widely in recent years Real GDP declined about 5 in 1987
 as the fish catch fell sharply to only onefourth the level of 1986
 and copra production was hampered by repeated rains Output rebounded

Korea NorthEconomy

 Overview More than 90 of this command economy is socialized
 agricultural land is collectivized and stateowned industry produces
 95 of manufactured goods State control of economic affairs is
 unusually tight even for a Communist country because of the small size
 and homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM Ilsong in
 the past and now his son KIM Chongil Economic growth during the
 period 198488 averaged 23 but output declined by 35 annually
 during 198992 because of systemic problems and disruptions in
 socialiststyle economic relations with the former USSR and China In
 1992 output dropped sharply by perhaps 79 as the economy felt
 the cumulative effect of the reduction in outside support The
 leadership insisted on maintaining its high level of military outlays
 from a shrinking economic pie Moreover a serious drawdown in
 inventories and critical shortages in the energy sector have led to
 increasing interruptions in industrial production Abundant mineral
 resources and hydropower have formed the basis of industrial
 development since World War II Output of the extractive industries
 includes coal iron ore magnesite graphite copper zinc lead and
 precious metals Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry
 including military industry with light industry lagging far behind
 Despite the use of improved seed varieties expansion of irrigation
 and the heavy use of fertilizers North Korea has not yet become
 selfsufficient in food production Indeed a shortage of arable
 lands several years of poor harvests and a cumbersome distribution
 system have resulted in chronic food shortages The collapse of
 Communism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in 198991 has
 disrupted important technological links North Korea remains far
 behind South Korea in economic development and living standards GDP
 is stagnant

Korea SouthEconomy

 Overview The driving force behind the economys dynamic growth has
 been the planned development of an exportoriented economy in a
 vigorously entrepreneurial society Real GDP increased more than 10
 annually between 1986 and 1991 This growth ultimately led to an
 overheated situation characterized by a tight labor market strong
 inflationary pressures and a rapidly rising current account deficit
 As a result in 1992 economic policy focused on slowing the growth
 rate of inflation and reducing the deficit Annual growth slowed to
 5 still above the rate in most other countries of the world and
 recovered to 63 in 1993 The economy expanded by 83 in 1994
 driven by booming exports

KuwaitEconomy

 Overview Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with proved
 crude oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels  10 of world
 reserves Kuwait has rebuilt its warravaged petroleum sector its
 crude oil production reached at least 20 million barrels per day by
 the end of 1993 The government ran a sizable fiscal deficit in 1993
 Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP and 90 of export and
 government revenues Kuwait lacks water and has practically no arable
 land thus preventing development of agriculture With the exception
 of fish it depends almost wholly on food imports About 75 of
 potable water must be distilled or imported Because of its high per
 capita income comparable with Western European incomes Kuwait
 provides its citizens with extensive health educational and
 retirement benefits Per capita military expenditures are among the
 highest in the world The economy improved moderately in 1994 with
 the growth in industry and finance and should see further gains in
 1995 especially if oil prices go up The World Bank has urged Kuwait
 to push ahead with privatization including in the oil industry but
 the government will move slowly on this front

KyrgyzstanEconomy

 Overview Kyrgyzstan is one of the smallest and poorest states of the
 former Soviet Union Its economy is heavily agricultural growing
 cotton and tobacco on irrigated land in the south and grain in the
 foothills of the north and raising sheep and goats on mountain
 pastures Its small and obsolescent industrial sector concentrated
 around Bishkek has traditionally relied on Russia and other CIS
 countries for customers and industrial inputs including most of its
 fuel Since 1990 the economy has contracted by almost 50 as
 subsidies from Moscow vanished and trade links with other former
 Soviet republics eroded At the same time the Kyrgyz government stuck
 to tight monetary and fiscal policies in 1994 that succeeded in
 reducing inflation from 23 per month in 1993 to 54 per month in
 1994 Moreover Kyrgyzstan has been the most successful of the Central
 Asian states in reducing state controls over the economy and
 privatizing state industries Nevertheless restructuring proved to be
 a slow and painful process in 1994 despite relatively large flows of
 foreign aid and continued progress on economic reform The decline in
 output in 1995 may be much smaller perhaps 5 compared with an
 estimated 24 in 1994

LaosEconomy

 Overview The government of Laos  one of the few remaining official
 Communist states  has been decentralizing control and encouraging
 private enterprise since 1986 The results starting from an extremely
 low base have been striking  growth has averaged 75 annually since
 1988 Even so Laos is a landlocked country with a primitive
 infrastructure It has no railroads a rudimentary road system and
 limited external and internal telecommunications Electricity is
 available in only a few urban areas Subsistence agriculture accounts
 for half of GDP and provides 80 of total employment The predominant
 crop is rice In nondrought years Laos is selfsufficient overall in
 food but each year flood pests and localized drought cause
 shortages in various parts of the country For the foreseeable future
 the economy will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and other
 international sources aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has
 been cut sharply As in many developing countries deforestation and
 soil erosion will hamper efforts to maintain the high rate of GDP

LatviaEconomy

 Overview Latvia is rapidly becoming a dynamic market economy rivaled
 only by Estonia among the former Soviet states in the speed of its
 transformation However the transition has been painful in 1994 the
 IMF reported a 2 growth in GDP following steep declines in 199293
 The governments tough monetary policies and reform program have kept
 inflation at less than 2 a month supported a dynamic private sector
 now accounting for more than half of GDP and spurred the growth of
 trade ties with the West Much of agriculture is already privatized
 and the government plans to step up the pace of privatization of state
 enterprises Latvia thus is in the midst of recovery helped by the
 countrys strategic location on the Baltic Sea its welleducated
 population and its diverse  albeit largely obsolete  industrial

LEBANON

 NoteLebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political
 institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since the end of
 the devastating 16year civil war which began in 1975 Under the Taif
 accord  the blueprint for national reconciliation  the Lebanese have
 established a more equitable political system particularly by giving
 Muslims a greater say in the political process Since December 1990
 the Lebanese have formed three cabinets and conducted the first
 legislative election in 20 years Most of the militias have been
 weakened or disbanded The Lebanese Armed Forces LAF has seized vast
 quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and extended
 central government authority over about onehalf of the country
 Hizballah the radical Shia party retains most of its weapons
 Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon Israel maintains troops
 in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia The Army
 of South Lebanon ASL along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous
 to its border The ASLs enclave encompasses this selfdeclared
 security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of
 Jazzine As of December 1993 Syria maintained about 3000035000
 troops in Lebanon These troops are based mainly in Beirut North
 Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley Syrias deployment was legitimized by
 the Arab League early in Lebanons civil war and in the Taif accord
 Citing the continued weakness of the LAF Beiruts requests and
 failure of the Lebanese Government to implement all of the
 constitutional reforms in the Taif accord Damascus has so far
 refused to withdraw its troops from Beirut

LebanonEconomy

 Overview The 19751991 civil war seriously damaged Lebanons economic
 infrastructure cut national output by half and all but ended
 Lebanons position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub A
 tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin restoring
 control in Beirut collect taxes and regain access to key port and
 government facilities The battered economy has also been propped up
 by a financially sound banking system and resilient small and
 mediumscale manufacturers Family remittances banking transactions
 manufactured and farm exports the narcotics trade and international
 emergency aid are the main sources of foreign exchange In the
 relatively settled year of 1991 industrial production agricultural
 output and exports showed substantial gains The further rebuilding
 of the warravaged country was delayed in 1992 because of an upturn in
 political wrangling In October 1992 Rafiq HARIRI was appointed Prime
 Minister HARIRI a wealthy entrepreneur announced ambitious plans
 for Lebanons reconstruction which involve a substantial influx of
 foreign aid and investment Progress on restoring basic services is
 limited Since Prime Minister HARIRIs appointment the most
 significant improvement lies in the stabilization of the Lebanese
 pound which had gained over 30 in value by yearend 1993 The years
 1993 and 1994 were marked by efforts of the new administration to
 encourage domestic and foreign investment and to obtain additional

LesothoEconomy

 Overview Small landlocked and mountainous Lesotho has no important
 natural resources other than water Its economy is based on
 agriculture light manufacturing and remittances from laborers
 employed in South Africa these remittances supplement domestic income
 by as much as 45 The great majority of households gain their
 livelihoods from subsistence farming and migrant labor a large
 portion of the adult male work force is employed in South African
 mines Manufacturing depends largely on farm products to support the
 milling canning leather and jute industries other industries
 include textile clothing and construction Although drought has
 decreased agricultural activity over the past few years improvement
 of a major hydropower facility will permit the sale of water to South
 Africa and allow Lesothos economy to continue its moderate growth

LiberiaEconomy

 Overview Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberias
 economy especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia
 Businessmen have fled the country taking capital and expertise with
 them Many will not return Richly endowed with water mineral
 resources forests and a climate favorable to agriculture Liberia
 had been a producer and exporter of basic products while local
 manufacturing mainly foreign owned had been small in scope
 Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction
 and repatriation of some 750000 Liberian refugees who have fled to
 neighboring countries The political impasse between the interim
 government and rebel leader Charles TAYLOR has prevented restoration
 of normal economic life including the reestablishment of a strong
 central government with effective economic development programs The
 economy deteriorated further in 1994

LibyaEconomy

 Overview The socialistoriented economy depends primarily upon
 revenues from the oil sector which contributes practically all export
 earnings and about onethird of GDP In 1990 per capita GDP was the
 highest in Africa at 5410 but GDP growth rates have slowed and
 fluctuated sharply in response to changes in the world oil market
 Import restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to
 periodic shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs Windfall revenues
 from the hike in world oil prices in late 1990 improved the foreign
 payments position and resulted in a current account surplus through
 1992 The nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors which account
 for about 20 of GDP have expanded from processing mostly
 agricultural products to include petrochemicals iron steel and
 aluminum Although agriculture accounts for only 5 of GDP it employs
 18 of the labor force Climatic conditions and poor soils severely
 limit farm output and Libya imports about 75 of its food
 requirements The UN sanctions imposed in April 1992 have not yet had
 a major impact on the economy because Libyas oil revenues generate
 sufficient foreign exchange which sustains imports of food consumer
 goods and equipment for the oil industry and ongoing development
 projects

LithuaniaEconomy

 Overview Since independence in September 1991 Lithuania has made
 steady progress in developing a market economy Almost 50 of state
 property has been privatized and trade is diversifying with a gradual
 shift away from the former Soviet Union to Western markets In
 addition the Lithuanian government has adhered to a disciplined
 budgetary and financial policy which has brought inflation down from a
 monthly average of around 14 in first half 1993 to an average of 31
 in 1994 Nevertheless the process has been painful with industrial
 output in 1993 less than half the 1991 level The economy appeared to
 have bottomed out in 1994 and Vilniuss policies have laid the
 groundwork for vigorous recovery over the next few years Recovery
 will build on Lithuanians strategic location with its icefree port
 at Klaipeda and its rail and highway hub in Vilnius connecting it with
 Eastern Europe Belarus Russia and Ukraine and on its agriculture

 Overview The stable prosperous economy features moderate growth low
 inflation and negligible unemployment Agriculture is based on small
 but highly productive familyowned farms The industrial sector until
 recently dominated by steel has become increasingly more diversified

 decline in steel Services especially banking account for a growing
 proportion of the economy Luxembourg participates in an economic
 union with Belgium on trade and most financial matters is also
 closely connected economically to the Netherlands and as a member of
 the 15member European Union enjoys the advantages of the open

Macedonia The Former Yugoslav Republic OfEconomy

 Overview The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia although the
 poorest republic in the former Yugoslav federation can meet basic
 food and energy needs through its own agricultural and coal resources
 Its economic decline will continue unless ties are reforged or
 enlarged with its neighbors Serbia and Montenegro Albania Greece
 and Bulgaria The economy depends on outside sources for all of its
 oil and gas and most of its modern machinery and parts An important
 supplement of GDP is the remittances from thousands of Macedonians
 working in Germany and other West European nations Continued
 political turmoil both internally and in the region as a whole
 prevents any swift readjustments of trade patterns and economic
 programs The countrys industrial output and GDP are expected to
 decline further in 1995 The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonias
 geographical isolation technological backwardness and potential
 political instability place it far down the list of countries of
 interest to Western investors Resolution of the dispute with Greece
 and an internal commitment to economic reform would encourage foreign
 investment over the long run In the immediate future the worst
 scenario for the economy would be the spread of fighting across its
 borders

MadagascarEconomy

 Overview Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world
 suffering from chronic malnutrition underfunded health and education
 facilities a 3 annual population growth rate and severe loss of
 forest cover accompanied by erosion Agriculture including fishing
 and forestry is the mainstay of the economy accounting for over 30
 of GDP and contributing more than 70 of total export earnings
 Industry is largely confined to the processing of agricultural
 products and textile manufacturing in 1991 it accounted for only 13
 of GDP In 1986 the government introduced a fiveyear development plan
 that stressed selfsufficiency in food mainly rice by 1990
 increased production for exports and reduced energy imports
 Subsequently growth in output has been held back because of
 protracted antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political
 reform Since 1993 corruption and political instability have caused
 the economy and infrastructure to decay further Since April 1994 the
 government commitment to economic reforms has been erratic Enormous
 obstacles stand in the way of Madagascars realizing its considerable
 growth potential

MalawiEconomy

 Overview Landlocked Malawi ranks among the worlds least developed
 countries The economy is predominately agricultural with about 90
 of the population living in rural areas Agriculture accounts for 40
 of GDP and 90 of export revenues After two years of weak
 performance economic growth improved significantly in 198891 as a
 result of good weather and a broadly based economic adjustment effort
 by the government Drought cut overall output sharply in 1992 but the
 lost ground was recovered in 1993 The economy depends on substantial
 inflows of economic assistance from the IMF the World Bank and
 individual donor nations The new government faces strong challenges
 eg to spur exports to improve educational and health facilities
 and to deal with environmental problems of deforestation and erosion

MaldivesEconomy

 Overview Fishing is the largest industry employing 25 of the work
 force and accounting for over 60 of exports Over 90 of government
 tax revenue comes from import duties and tourismrelated taxes During
 the 1980s tourism became one of the most important and highest growth
 sectors of the economy In 1993 tourism accounted for 17 of GDP and
 more than 60 of the Maldives foreign exchange receipts The
 Maldivian government initiated an economic reform program in 1989
 initially by lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the
 private sector Subsequently it has liberalized regulations to allow
 more foreign investment Agriculture and manufacturing continue to
 play a minor role in the economy constrained by the limited
 availability of cultivatable land and the shortage of domestic labor
 Most staple foods must be imported In 1993 industry which consisted
 mainly of garment production boat building and handicrafts accounted
 for about 6 of GDP

 Overview Mali is among the poorest countries in the world with 65
 of its land area desert or semidesert Economic activity is largely
 confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger About 10 of the
 population is nomadic and some 80 of the labor force is engaged in
 agriculture and fishing Industrial activity is concentrated on
 processing farm commodities The economy is beginning to turn around
 after contracting through 199293 largely because of enhanced exports
 and import substitute production in the wake of the 50 devaluation of
 January 1994 Postdevaluation inflation appears to have peaked at 35
 in 1994 and the government appears to be keeping on track with its IMF
 structural adjustment program

MartiniqueEconomy

 Overview The economy is based on sugarcane bananas tourism and
 light industry Agriculture accounts for about 10 of GDP and the
 small industrial sector for 10 Sugar production has declined with
 most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum Banana
 exports are increasing going mostly to France The bulk of meat
 vegetable and grain requirements must be imported contributing to a
 chronic trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from
 France Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as
 a source of foreign exchange The majority of the work force is
 employed in the service sector and in administration Banana workers
 launched protests late in 1992 because of falling banana prices and
 fears of greater competition in the European market from other
 producers

MauritaniaEconomy

 Overview A majority of the population still depends on agriculture
 and livestock for a livelihood even though most of the nomads and
 many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent
 droughts in the 1970s and 1980s Mauritania has extensive deposits of
 iron ore which account for almost 50 of total exports The decline
 in world demand for this ore however has led to cutbacks in
 production The nations coastal waters are among the richest fishing
 areas in the world but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this
 key source of revenue The countrys first deepwater port opened near
 Nouakchott in 1986 In recent years drought and economic
 mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of foreign debt
 The government has begun the second stage of an economic reform
 program in consultation with the World Bank the IMF and major donor
 countries Shortterm growth prospects are gloomy because of the heavy
 debt service burden rapid population growth and vulnerability to
 climatic conditions

MexicoEconomy

 Overview Mexico under the guidance of new President Ernesto ZEDILLO
 entered 1995 in the midst of a severe financial crisis Mexicos
 membership in the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA with the
 United States and Canada its solid record of economic reforms and
 its strong growth in the second and third quarters of 1994  at an
 annual rate of 38 and 45 respectively  seemed to augur bright
 prospects for 1995 However an overvalued exchange rate and widening
 current account deficits created an imbalance that ultimately proved
 unsustainable To finance the trade gap Mexico City had become
 increasingly reliant on volatile portfolio investment A series of
 political shocks in 1994  an uprising in the southern state of
 Chiapas the assassination of a presidential candidate several high
 profile kidnappings the killing of a second highlevel political
 figure and renewed threats from the Chiapas rebels  combined with
 rising international interest rates and concerns of a devaluation to
 undermine investor confidence and prompt massive outflows of capital
 The dwindling of foreign exchange reserves which the central bank had
 been using to defend the currency forced the new administration to
 change the exchange rate policy and allow the currency to float freely
 in the last days of 1994 The adjustment roiled Mexican financial
 markets leading to a 30 to 40 weakening of the peso relative to the
 dollar ZEDILLO announced an emergency economic program that included
 federal budget cuts and plans for more privatizations but it failed
 to restore investor confidence quickly While the devaluation is
 likely to help Mexican exporters whose products are now cheaper it
 also raises the specter of an inflationary spiral if domestic
 producers increase their prices and workers demand wage hikes
 Although strong economic fundamentals bode well for Mexicos
 longerterm outlook prospects for solid growth and low inflation have
 deteriorated considerably at least through 1995

MoldovaEconomy

 Overview Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland but has
 no major mineral deposits As a result Moldovas economy is primarily
 based on agriculture featuring fruits vegetables wine and tobacco
 Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil coal and natural gas
 and energy shortages have contributed to sharp production declines
 since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 The Moldovan government
 is making steady progress on an ambitious economic reform agenda and
 the IMF has called Moldova a model for the region As part of its
 reform efforts Chisinau has introduced a stable currency freed all
 prices stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises and
 backed their steady privatization removed export controls and freed
 interest rates Chisinau appears strongly committed to continuing
 these reforms in 1995 Meanwhile privatization of medium and large
 enterprises got underway in mid1994 and is expected to pick up speed
 in 1995 To improve its precarious energy situation Chisinau reached
 an agreement with Moscow in December 1994 on gas deliveries for 1995
 Gazprom Russias national gas company has agreed to reduce prices
 for natural gas deliveries to Moldova from the world market price of
 80thousand cubic meters tcm to 58tcm in return for part
 ownership of the Moldovan pipeline system

MongoliaEconomy

 Overview Mongolias severe climate scattered population and wide
 expanses of unproductive land have constrained economic development
 Economic activity traditionally has been based on agriculture and the
 breeding of livestock In past years extensive mineral resources had
 been developed with Soviet support total Soviet assistance at its
 height amounted to 30 of GDP The mining and processing of coal
 copper molybdenum tin tungsten and gold account for a large part
 of industrial production Timber and fishing are also important
 sectors The Mongolian leadership has been gradually making the
 transition from Sovietstyle central planning to a market economy
 through privatization and price reform and is soliciting support from
 international financial agencies and foreign investors The economy
 however has still not recovered from the loss of Soviet aid and the
 country continues to suffer substantial economic hardships with
 onefourth of the population below the poverty line

 activity and foreign trade and keeping inflation within bounds Since
 the early 1980s the government has pursued an economic program toward
 these objectives with the support of the IMF the World Bank and the
 Paris Club of creditors The economy has substantial assets to draw
 on the worlds largest phosphate reserves diverse agricultural and
 fishing resources a sizable tourist industry a growing manufacturing
 sector and remittances from Moroccans working abroad A severe
 drought in 199293 depressed economic activity and held down exports
 Real GDP contracted by 44 in 1992 and 11 in 1993 Despite these
 setbacks initiatives to relax capital controls strengthen the
 banking sector and privatize state enterprises went forward in
 199394 Favorable rainfall in 1994 boosted agricultural production by

MozambiqueEconomy

 Overview One of Africas poorest countries Mozambique has failed to
 exploit the economic potential of its sizable agricultural
 hydropower and transportation resources Indeed national output
 consumption and investment declined throughout the first half of the
 1980s because of internal disorders lack of government administrative
 control and a growing foreign debt A sharp increase in foreign aid
 attracted by an economic reform policy resulted in successive years
 of economic growth in the late 1980s but aid has declined steadily
 since 1989 Agricultural output is at only 75 of its 1981 level and
 grain has to be imported Industry operates at only 2040 of
 capacity The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep
 afloat Peace accords signed in October 1992 improved chances of
 foreign investment aided IMFsupported economic reforms and
 supported continued economic recovery Elections held in 1994 diverted
 government attention from the economy resulting in slippage and
 delays in the economic reform program Nonetheless growth in 1994 was
 solid and can continue into the late 1990s given continued foreign
 help in meeting debt obligations

NauruEconomy

 Overview Revenues come from the export of phosphates the reserves of
 which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000 Phosphates have
 given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third
 World Few other resources exist so most necessities must be
 imported including fresh water from Australia The rehabilitation of
 mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious
 longterm problems Substantial amounts of phosphate income are
 invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition

NepalEconomy

 Overview Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in
 the world Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy providing a
 livelihood for over 90 of the population and accounting for half of
 GDP Industrial activity is limited mainly involving the processing
 of agricultural produce jute sugarcane tobacco and grain
 Production of textiles and carpets has expanded recently and accounted
 for 85 of foreign exchange earnings in FY9394 Apart from
 agricultural land and forests exploitable natural resources are mica
 hydropower and tourism Agricultural production in the late 1980s
 grew by about 5 as compared with annual population growth of 26
 More than 40 of the population is undernourished Since May 1991 the
 government has been encouraging trade and foreign investment eg by
 eliminating business licenses and registration requirements in order
 to simplify domestic and foreign investment The government also has
 been cutting public expenditures by reducing subsidies privatizing
 state industries and laying off civil servants Prospects for foreign
 trade and investment in the 1990s remain poor however because of the
 small size of the economy its technological backwardness its
 remoteness and susceptibility to natural disaster The international
 community provides funding for 70 of Nepals developmental budget and
 for 30 of total budgetary expenditures The government realizing
 that attempts to reverse three years of liberalization would
 jeopardize this vital support almost certainly will move ahead with
 its reform program in 199596

NetherlandsEconomy

 Overview This highly developed and affluent economy is based on
 private enterprise The government makes its presence felt however
 through many regulations permit requirements and welfare programs
 affecting most aspects of economic activity The trade and financial
 services sector contributes over 50 of GDP Industrial activity
 provides about 25 of GDP and is led by the foodprocessing
 oilrefining and metalworking industries The highly mechanized
 agricultural sector employs only 4 of the labor force but provides
 large surpluses for export and the domestic foodprocessing industry
 Indeed the Netherlands ranks third worldwide in value of agricultural
 exports behind the US and France High unemployment and a sizable
 budget deficit are currently the most serious economic problems Many
 of the economic issues of the 1990s will reflect the course of
 European economic integration

New ZealandEconomy

 Overview Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian
 economy dependent on a guaranteed British market to a more
 industrialized open free market economy that can compete on the
 global scene The government has hoped that dynamic growth would boost
 real incomes broaden and deepen the technological capabilities of the
 industrial sector reduce inflationary pressures and permit the
 expansion of welfare benefits The initial results were mixed
 inflation is down from doubledigit levels but growth was sluggish in
 198891 In 199293 growth picked up to 3 annually a sign that the
 new economic approach was beginning to pay off Business confidence
 strengthened in 1994 and export demand picked up in the AsiaPacific
 region resulting in 62 growth Inflation remains among the lowest
 in the industrial world

NicaraguaEconomy

 Overview Since March 1991 when President CHAMORRO began an ambitious
 economic stabilization program Nicaragua has had considerable success
 in reducing inflation and obtaining substantial economic aid from
 abroad Annual inflation fell from more than 750 in 1991 to less than
 5 in 1992 Inflation rose again to an estimated 20 in 1993 although
 this increase was due almost entirely to a large currency devaluation
 in January As of early 1994 the government was close to finalizing
 an enhanced structural adjustment facility with the IMF after the
 previous standby facility expired in early 1993 Despite these
 successes achieving overall economic growth in an economy scarred by
 misguided economic values and civil war during the 1980s has proved
 elusive Economic growth was flat in 1992 and slightly negative in
 1993 Nicaraguas per capita foreign debt is one of the highest in the
 world nonetheless as of late 1993 Nicaragua was current on its
 post1988 debt as well as on payments to the international financial
 institutions Definition of property rights remains a problem
 ownership disputes over large tracts of land businesses and homes
 confiscated by the previous government have yet to be resolved A rise
 in exports of coffee and other products led growth in 1994

NigerEconomy

 Overview Niger is one of the worlds poorest countries with GDP
 growth lagging behind the rapid growth of population The economy is
 centered on subsistence agriculture animal husbandry and reexport
 trade and increasingly less on uranium its major export throughout
 the 1970s and 1980s Uranium revenues dropped by almost 50 between
 1983 and 1990 with the end of the uranium boom Terms of trade with
 Nigeria Nigers largest regional trade partner have improved
 dramatically since the 50 devaluation of the African franc in January
 1994 this devaluation boosted exports of livestock peas onions and
 the products of Nigers small cotton industry The government relies
 on bilateral and multilateral aid for operating expenses and public
 investment and is strongly induced to adhere to structural adjustment
 programs designed by the IMF and the World Bank

NigeriaEconomy

 Overview The oilrich Nigerian economy continues to be hobbled by
 political instability and poor macroeconomic management Nigerias
 unpopular military rulers show no sign of wanting to restore
 democratic civilian rule in the near future and appear divided on how
 to redress fundamental economic imbalances that cause troublesome
 inflation and the steady depreciation of the naira The governments
 domestic and international arrears continue to limit economic growth 
 even in the oil sector  and prevent an agreement with the IMF and
 bilateral creditors on debt relief The inefficient largely
 subsistence agricultural sector has failed to keep up with rapid
 population growth and Nigeria once a large net exporter of food now
 must import food

 fruit lime oil honey and coconut cream The sale of postage stamps
 to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue The island in

 source of income is the tourist industry which now employs about 50
 of the work force Japanese tourists predominate The agricultural
 sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches and

NorwayEconomy

 Overview Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free
 market activity and government intervention The government controls
 key areas such as the vital petroleum sector through largescale
 state enterprises and extensively subsidizes agriculture fishing
 and areas with sparse resources Norway also maintains an extensive
 welfare system that helps propel public sector expenditures to
 slightly more than 50 of the GDP and results in one of the highest
 average tax burdens in the world 54 A small country with a high
 dependence on international trade Norway is basically an exporter of
 raw materials and semiprocessed goods with an abundance of small and
 mediumsized firms and is ranked among the major shipping nations
 The country is richly endowed with natural resources  petroleum
 hydropower fish forests and minerals  and is highly dependent on
 its oil sector to keep its economy afloat Norway imports more than
 half its food needs Although one of the governments main priorities
 is to reduce this dependency this situation is not likely to improve
 for years to come The government also hopes to reduce unemployment
 and strengthen and diversify the economy through tax reform and a
 series of expansionary budgets The budget deficit is expected to hit
 a record 8 of GDP because of welfare spending and bailouts of the
 banking system Unemployment is currently running at 84  including
 those in job programs  because of the weakness of the economy outside
 the oil sector Economic growth only 16 in 1993 moved up to 55

OmanEconomy

 Overview Economic performance is closely tied to the fortunes of the
 oil industry including trends in international oil prices and the
 ability of OPEC producers to agree on output quotas Petroleum
 accounts for more than 85 of export earnings about 80 of government
 revenues and roughly 40 of GDP Oman has proved oil reserves of 4
 billion barrels equivalent to about 20 years supply at the current
 rate of extraction Agriculture is carried on at a subsistence level
 and the general population depends on imported food The government is
 encouraging private investment both domestic and foreign as a prime
 force for further economic development

PACIFIC OCEAN

Pacific OceanGeography

 Location body of water between Antarctica Asia Australia and the
 Western Hemisphere

 Map references World

 Area
 total area 165384 million sq km
 comparative area about 18 times the size of the US the largest ocean
 followed by the Atlantic Ocean the Indian Ocean and the Arctic
 Ocean covers about onethird of the global surface larger than the
 total land area of the world
 note includes Bali Sea Bellingshausen Sea Bering Sea Bering
 Strait Coral Sea East China Sea Flores Sea Gulf of Alaska Gulf of
 Tonkin Java Sea Philippine Sea Ross Sea Savu Sea Sea of Japan
 Sea of Okhotsk South China Sea Tasman Sea Timor Sea and other
 tributary water bodies

 Coastline 135663 km

 International disputes some maritime disputes see littoral states

 Climate the western Pacific is monsoonal  a rainy season occurs
 during the summer months when moistureladen winds blow from the
 ocean over the land and a dry season during the winter months when
 dry winds blow from the Asian land mass back to the ocean

 Terrain surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a
 clockwise warmwater gyre broad circular system of currents and in
 the southern Pacific by a counterclockwise coolwater gyre in the
 northern Pacific sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in
 winter in the southern Pacific sea ice from Antarctica reaches its
 northernmost extent in October the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific
 is dominated by the East Pacific Rise while the western Pacific is
 dissected by deep trenches including the worlds deepest the 10924
 meter Marianas Trench

 Natural resources oil and gas fields polymetallic nodules sand and
 gravel aggregates placer deposits fish

 Environment
 current issues endangered marine species include the dugong sea
 lion sea otter seals turtles and whales oil pollution in
 Philippine Sea and South China Sea
 natural hazards surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and
 earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire
 subject to tropical cyclones typhoons in southeast and east Asia
 from May to December most frequent from July to October tropical
 cyclones hurricanes may form south of Mexico and strike Central
 America and Mexico from June to October most common in August and
 September southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from
 Antarctica occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru
 when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent
 moves south killing the plankton that is the primary food source for
 anchovies consequently the anchovies move to better feeding grounds
 causing resident marine birds to starve by the thousands because of
 their lost food source ships subject to superstructure icing in
 extreme north from October to May and in extreme south from May to
 October persistent fog in the northern Pacific can be a maritime
 hazard from June to December
 international agreements NA

 Note the major choke points are the Bering Strait Panama Canal
 Luzon Strait and the Singapore Strait the Equator divides the
 Pacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific
 Ocean dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in

Pacific OceanEconomy

 Overview The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world
 economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch
 It provides lowcost sea transportation between East and West
 extensive fishing grounds offshore oil and gas fields minerals and
 sand and gravel for the construction industry In 1985 over half 54
 of the worlds fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean which is the
 only ocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978
 Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an
 everincreasing role in the energy supplies of Australia NZ China
 US and Peru The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas
 combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985 has
 slowed but not stopped new drillings

PakistanEconomy

 Overview The Pakistani economy has made progress in several key areas
 since Benazir BHUTTO became Prime Minister in October 1993 She has
 been under pressure from international donors and the IMF  which gave
 Pakistan a 13 billion structural adjustment credit in February 1994
  to continue the economic reforms and austerity measures begun by her
 predecessor caretaker Prime Minister Moeen QURESHI JulyOctober
 1993 Foreign exchange reserves climbed to more than 3 billion in
 1994 and the budget deficit was substantially reduced Real GDP
 growth was 4 in FY9394 up from 23 in FY9293 Foreign direct and
 portfolio investment also have increased Privatization of large
 public sector utilities began in 1994 with the sale of 12 of the
 Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation PTC and the Water and Power
 Development Authority WAPDA the sale of stateowned banks and other
 large units are planned for 1995 Still the government must cope with
 longstanding economic vulnerabilities  high levels of debt service
 and defense spending a small tax base a huge population and
 dependence on cottonbased exports  which hamper its ability to
 create a stable economic environment In addition Pakistans
 infrastructure is inadequate and deteriorating low levels of literacy
 constrain industrial growth and increasing sectarian ethnic and

PanamaEconomy

 Overview Because of its key geographic location Panamas economy is
 servicebased heavily weighted toward banking commerce and tourism
 Trade and financial ties with the US are especially close GDP grew at
 36 in 1994 a respectable rate yet below the 71 average of the
 early 1990s Banking and financial services and trade through the
 Colon Free Zone continued to expand rapidly with the industrial and
 agricultural sectors experiencing little growth The new
 administration inaugurated 1 September 1994 has launched an economic
 plan designed to reverse rising unemployment attract foreign
 investment cut back the size of government and modernize the
 economy The success of the plan in meeting its goals for 1995 and
 beyond depends largely on the success of the administration in
 reforming the labor code and instituting the reforms necessary to join
 the GATT

Papua New GuineaEconomy

 Overview Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources
 but exploitation has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high
 cost of developing an infrastructure Agriculture provides a
 subsistence livelihood for 85 of the population Mining of numerous
 deposits including copper and gold accounts for about 60 of export
 earnings Budgetary support from Australia and development aid under
 World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy Robust growth in
 199192 was led by the mining sector the opening of a large new gold
 mine helped the advance At the start of 1995 Port Moresby is looking
 primarily to the exploitation of mineral and petroleum resources to
 drive economic development but new prospecting in Papua New Guinea has
 slumped as other mineralrich countries have stepped up their
 competition for international investment Output from current projects
 will probably begin to taper off in 1996 but no new large ventures
 are being developed to succeed them

ParaguayEconomy

 Overview Agriculture including forestry accounts for about 25 of
 GDP employs about 45 of the labor force and provides the bulk of
 exports in which soybeans and cotton are the most important Paraguay
 lacks substantial mineral or petroleum resources but possesses a large
 hydropower potential In a major step to increase its economic
 activity in the region Paraguay in March 1991 joined the Southern
 Cone Common Market MERCOSUR which includes Brazil Argentina and
 Uruguay In 1992 the government through an unorthodox approach
 reduced external debt with both commercial and official creditors by
 purchasing a sizable amount of the delinquent commercial debt in the
 secondary market at a substantial discount The government had paid
 100 of remaining official debt arrears to the US Germany France
 and Spain All commercial debt arrears have been rescheduled For the
 long run the government must press forward with general
 marketoriented economic reforms Growth of 35 in 1993 was spurred
 by higherthanexpected agricultural output and rising international
 commodity prices Inflation picked up steam in fourth quarter 1993
 because of rises in public sector salaries and utility rates GDP
 growth continued in 1994 at 35 Although inflation declined a bit
 over 1993 increases in food prices and crop and infrastructure
 damage from heavy rains at the end of the year forced inflation to
 18 above the governments target of 15 Paraguay reaffirmed its
 commitment to MERCOSUR on 1 January 1995 by implementing the
 organizations common external tariff

PeruEconomy

 Overview The Peruvian economy has become increasingly
 marketoriented with major privatizations completed in 1994 in the
 mining and telecommunications industries In the 1980s the economy
 suffered from hyperinflation declining per capita output and
 mounting external debt Peru was shut off from IMF and World Bank
 support in the mid1980s because of its huge debt arrears An
 austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government
 took office in July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly
 contraction of economic activity but the slide came to a halt late
 that year and in 1991 output rose 24 After a burst of inflation as
 the austerity program eliminated government price subsidies monthly
 price increases eased to the singledigit level and by December 1991
 dropped to the lowest increase since mid1987 Lima obtained a
 financial rescue package from multilateral lenders in September 1991
 although it faced 14 billion in arrears on its external debt By
 working with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and
 arrangements the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March
 1993 In 1992 GDP had fallen by 28 in part because a
 warmerthanusual El Nino current resulted in a 30 drop in the fish
 catch but the economy rebounded as strong foreign investment helped
 push growth to 6 in 1993 and 86 in 1994

PhilippinesEconomy

 Overview Domestic output in this primarily agricultural economy
 failed to grow in 1992 and rose only slightly in 1993 Drought and
 power supply problems hampered production while inadequate revenues
 prevented government pump priming Worker remittances helped to
 supplement GDP A marked increase in capital goods imports
 particularly power generating equipment telecommunications equipment
 and electronic data processors contributed to 20 annual import
 growth in 199294 Provided the government can cope with the
 substantial trade deficit and meet the fiscal targets agreed to with
 the IMF the Philippines should duplicate the strong growth

PolandEconomy

 Overview Poland continues to make good progress in the difficult
 transition to a market economy that began on 1 January 1990 when the
 new democratic government instituted shock therapy by decontrolling
 prices slashing subsidies and drastically reducing import barriers
 Real GDP fell sharply in 1990 and 1991 but in 1992 Poland became the
 first country in the region to resume economic growth with a 26
 increase Growth increased to 38 in 1993 and 55 in 1994  the
 highest rate in Europe except for Albania All of the growth since
 1991 has come from the booming private sector which now accounts for
 at least 55 of GDP even though privatization of the stateowned
 enterprises is proceeding slowly and most industry remains in state
 hands Industrial production increased 12 in 1994  led by 50 jumps
 in the output of motor vehicles radios and televisions and pulp and
 paper  and is now well above the 1990 level Inflation which had
 approached 1200 annually in early 1990 was down to about 30 in
 1994 as the government held the budget deficit to 15 of GDP After
 five years of steady increases unemployment has leveled off at about
 16 nationwide although it approaches 30 in some regions The trade
 deficit was sharply reduced in 1994 due mainly to increased exports
 to Western Europe Polands main customer The leftist government
 elected in September 1993 gets generally good marks from foreign
 observers for its management of the budget but is often criticized for
 not moving faster on privatization

ReunionEconomy

 Overview The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture
 Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a century and in
 some years it accounts for 85 of exports The government has been
 pushing the development of a tourist industry to relieve high
 unemployment which recently amounted to onethird of the labor force
 The gap in Reunion between the welloff and the poor is extraordinary
 and accounts for the persistent social tensions The white and Indian
 communities are substantially better off than other segments of the
 population often approaching European standards whereas indigenous
 groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer
 nations of the African continent The outbreak of severe rioting in
 February 1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions
 The economic wellbeing of Reunion depends heavily on continued
 financial assistance from France

RomaniaEconomy

 Overview Despite the continuing difficulties in moving away from the
 former command system the Romanian economy seems to have bottomed out
 in 199394 Market oriented reforms have been introduced fitfully
 since the downfall of CEAUSESCU in December 1989 with the result a
 growing private sector especially in services The slow pace of
 structural reform however has exacerbated Romanias high inflation
 rate and eroded real wages Agricultural production rebounded in 1993
 from the droughtreduced harvest of 1992 The economy continued its
 recovery in 1994 further gains being realized in agriculture
 construction services and trade Food supplies are adequate but
 expensive Romanias infrastructure had deteriorated over the last
 five years due to reduced levels of public investment Residents of
 the capital reported frequent disruptions of heating and water
 services The slow and painful process of conversion to a more open
 economy will continue in 1995

RussiaEconomy

 Overview Russia a vast country with a wealth of natural resources a
 welleducated population and a diverse industrial base continues to
 experience formidable difficulties in moving from its old centrally
 planned economy to a modern market economy President YELTSINs
 government has made substantial strides in converting to a market
 economy since launching its economic reform program in January 1992 by
 freeing nearly all prices slashing defense spending eliminating the
 old centralized distribution system completing an ambitious voucher
 privatization program establishing private financial institutions
 and decentralizing foreign trade Russia however has made little
 progress in a number of key areas that are needed to provide a solid
 foundation for the transition to a market economy Financial
 stabilization has remained elusive with wide swings in monthly
 inflation rates Only limited restructuring of industry has occurred
 so far because of a scarcity of investment funds and the failure of
 enterprise managers to make hard costcutting decisions In addition
 Moscow has yet to develop a social safety net that would allow faster
 restructuring by relieving enterprises of the burden of providing
 social benefits for their workers and has been slow to develop the
 legal framework necessary to fully support a market economy and to
 encourage foreign investment As a result output has continued to
 fall According to Russian official data which probably overstate the
 fall GDP declined by 15 in 1994 compared with a 12 decline in 1993
 Industrial output in 1994 fell 21 with all major sectors taking a
 hit Agricultural production in 1994 was down 9 The grain harvest
 totaled 81 million tons some 15 million tons less than in 1993
 Unemployment climbed to an estimated 66 million or about 7 of the
 work force by yearend 1994 Floundering Russian firms have already had
 to put another 48 million workers on involuntary unpaid leave or
 shortened workweeks Government fears of largescale unemployment
 continued to hamper industrial restructuring efforts According to
 official Russian data real per capita income was up nearly 18 in
 1994 compared with 1993 in part because many Russians are working
 second jobs Most Russians perceive that they are worse off now
 because of growing crime and health problems and mounting wage
 arrears Russia has made significant headway in privatizing state
 assets completing its voucher privatization program at midyear 1994
 At least a portion of about 110000 state enterprises were transferred
 to private hands by the end of 1994 Including partially privatized
 firms the private sector accounted for roughly half of GDP in 1994
 Financial stabilization continued to remain a challenge for the
 government Moscow tightened financial policies in late 1993 and early
 1994 including postponing planned budget spending and succeeded in
 reducing monthly inflation from 18 in January to about 5 in July and
 August At midyear however the government relaxed austerity measures
 in the face of mounting pressure from industry and agriculture
 sparking a new round of inflation the monthly inflation rate jumped
 to roughly 15 per month during the fourth quarter In response
 Moscow announced a fairly tight government budget for 1995 designed to
 bring monthly inflation down to around 1 by the end of 1995
 According to official statistics Russias 1994 trade with nations
 outside the former Soviet Union produced a 123 billion surplus up
 from 113 billion in 1993 Foreign sales  comprised largely of oil
 natural gas and other raw materials  grew more than 8 Imports also
 were up 8 as demand for food and other consumer goods surged Russian
 trade with other former Soviet republics continued to decline At the
 same time Russia paid only a fraction of the roughly 20 billion in
 debt that came due in 1994 and by the end of the year Russias hard
 currency foreign debt had risen to nearly 100 billion Moscow reached
 agreement to restructure debts with Paris Club official creditors in
 mid1994 and concluded a preliminary deal with its commercial bank
 creditors late in the year to reschedule debts owed them in early
 1995 Capital flight continued to be a serious problem in 1994 with
 billions of additional dollars in assets being moved abroad primarily
 to bank accounts in Europe Russias physical plant continues to
 deteriorate because of insufficient maintenance and new construction
 Plant and equipment on average are twice the age of the Wests Many
 years will pass before Russia can take full advantage of its natural
 resources and its human assets

 although Russia may still spend as much as 10 of its GDP on defense
 this is significantly below the 15 to 17 burden the former USSR
 carried during much of the 1980s conversion of military expenditures

RwandaEconomy

 Overview Rwanda is a poor African nation suffering bitterly from
 ethnicbased civil war Almost 50 of GDP comes from the agricultural
 sector coffee and tea make up 8090 of total exports The amount of
 fertile land is limited however and deforestation and soil erosion
 continue to create problems The industrial sector in Rwanda is small
 contributing only 17 to GDP Manufacturing focuses mainly on the
 processing of agricultural products The Rwandan economy remains
 dependent on coffeetea exports and foreign aid Weak international
 prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita
 GDP to decline A structural adjustment program with the World Bank
 began in October 1990 Ethnicbased insurgency since 1990 has
 devastated wide areas especially in the north and displaced hundreds
 of thousands of people A peace accord in mid1993 temporarily ended
 most of the fighting but massive resumption of civil warfare in April
 1994 in the capital city Kigali and elsewhere has been taking
 thousands of lives and severely affecting shortterm economic
 prospects The economy suffers massively from failure to maintain the
 infrastructure looting neglect of important cash crops and lack of
 health care facilities

Saint LuciaEconomy

 Overview Though foreign investment in manufacturing and information
 processing in recent years has increased Saint Lucias industrial
 base the economy remains vulnerable due to its heavy dependence on
 banana production which is subject to periodic droughts and tropical
 storms Indeed the destructive effect of Tropical Storm Debbie in
 mid1994 caused the loss of 60 of the years banana crop Increased
 competition from Latin American bananas will probably further reduce
 market prices exacerbating Saint Lucias need to diversify its
 economy in coming years eg by expanding tourism manufacturing
 and construction

Saint Pierre And MiquelonEconomy

 Overview The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood
 by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of
 Newfoundland The economy has been declining however because the
 number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the
 years In March 1989 an agreement between France and Canada set fish
 quotas for Saint Pierres trawlers fishing in Canadian and
 Canadianclaimed waters for three years The agreement settles a
 longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish exports to a
 halt The islands are heavily subsidized by France Imports come
 primarily from Canada and France

Sao Tome And PrincipeEconomy

 Overview This small poor island economy has remained dependent on
 cocoa since independence 20 years ago Since then however cocoa
 production has gradually declined because of drought and
 mismanagement so that by 1987 annual output had fallen from 10000
 tons to 3900 tons As a result a shortage of cocoa for export has
 created a serious balanceofpayments problem Production of less
 important crops such as coffee copra and palm kernels has also
 declined The value of imports generally exceeds that of exports by a
 ratio of 41 or more The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
 of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90 of food
 needs It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods
 Over the years Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt
 and has had to depend on concessional aid and debt rescheduling
 Considerable potential exists for development of a tourist industry
 and the government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent
 years The government also has attempted to reduce price controls and
 subsidies and to encourage marketbased mechanisms e g to
 facilitate the distribution of imported food Annual GDP growth is
 estimated in the 34 range for 199496

Saudi ArabiaEconomy

 Overview This is a welltodo oilbased economy with strong
 government controls over major economic activities About 46 of GDP
 comes from the private sector Economic as well as political ties
 with the US are especially strong The petroleum sector accounts for
 roughly 75 of budget revenues 35 of GDP and almost all export
 earnings Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves of petroleum in the
 world 26 of the proved total ranks as the largest exporter of
 petroleum and plays a leading role in OPEC For the 1990s the
 government intends to bring its budget which has been in deficit
 since 1983 back into balance and to encourage private economic
 activity Roughly four million foreign workers play an important role
 in the Saudi economy for example in the oil and banking sectors For
 about a decade Saudi Arabias domestic and international outlays have
 outstripped its income and the government has cut its foreign
 assistance and is beginning to rein in domestic programs For 1995
 the country looks for improvement in oil prices and will continue its
 policies of restraining public spending and encouraging nonoil

SenegalEconomy

 Overview In 1994 Senegal embarked on its most concerted structural
 adjustment effort yet to exploit the 50 devaluation of the currencies
 of the 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January After years of
 footdragging the government finally passed a liberalized labor code
 which should significantly help lower the cost of labor and improve
 the manufacturing sectors competitiveness Inroads also have been
 made in closing tax loopholes and eliminating monopoly power in
 several sectors At the same time the government is holding the line
 on current fiscal expenditure under the watchful eyes of international
 organizations on which it depends for substantial support A bumper
 peanut crop  Senegals main source of foreign exchange  coincided
 with an improvement of international prices and probably resulted in a
 doubling of earnings in 1994 over 1993 The countrys narrow resource
 base environmental degradation and untamed population growth will
 continue to hold back growth in living standards over the medium term

Serbia And MontenegroEconomy

 Overview The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation in 1991 has
 been followed by bloody ethnic warfare the destabilization of
 republic boundaries and the breakup of important interrepublic trade
 flows Serbia and Montenegro faces major economic problems output has
 dropped sharply particularly in 1993 First like the other former
 Yugoslav republics it depended on its sister republics for large
 amounts of foodstuffs energy supplies and manufactures Wide
 differences in climate mineral resources and levels of technology
 among the republics accentuated this interdependence as did the
 communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small
 number of giant plants The breakup of many of the trade links the
 sharp drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets
 and the destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have
 contributed to the economic difficulties of the republics One
 singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and Montenegro is
 the continuation in office of a communist government that is primarily
 interested in political and military mastery not economic reform A
 further complication is the imposition of economic sanctions by the UN
 in 1992 Hyperinflation ended with the establishment of a new currency
 unit in June 1993 prices were relatively stable in 1994 Reliable
 statistics are hard to come by the GDP estimate of 1000 per capita
 in 1994 is extremely rough Output in 1994 seems to have leveled off
 after the plunge in 1993

SeychellesEconomy

 Overview Since independence in 1976 per capita output has grown to
 roughly seven times the old nearsubsistence level led by the tourist
 sector which employs about 30 of the labor force and provides more
 than 70 of hard currency earnings In recent years the government has
 encouraged foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other
 services At the same time the government has moved to reduce the
 high dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming
 fishing and smallscale manufacturing The vulnerability of the
 tourist sector was illustrated by the sharp drop in 199192 due
 largely to the Gulf war Although the industry has rebounded the
 government recognizes the continuing need for upgrading the sector in
 the face of stiff international competition

Sierra LeoneEconomy

 Overview Sierra Leone has substantial mineral agricultural and
 fishery resources but the economic and social infrastructure is not
 well developed Agriculture generates about 40 of GDP and employs
 about twothirds of the working population with subsistence
 agriculture dominating the sector Manufacturing which accounts for
 roughly 10 of GDP consists mainly of the processing of raw materials
 and of light manufacturing for the domestic market Diamond mining
 provides an important source of hard currency Since 1990 the
 government has been able to meet its IMF and World Bankmandated
 stabilization targets holding down fiscal deficits increasing
 foreign exchange reserves and retiring much of its domestic debt 
 but at a steep cost in terms of capital investments and social
 spending Moreover the economic infrastructure has nearly collapsed
 due to neglect and warrelated disruptions in the mining and
 agricultural export sectors The continuing civil war in Liberia has
 led to a large influx of refugees who place additional burdens on
 Sierra Leons fragile economy

SlovakiaEconomy

 Overview In 1994 macroeconomic performance improved steadily but
 privatization progressed only in fits and starts Most of Slovakias
 IMFapproved targets were met by an interim government that lasted 9
 months Annual inflation fell from 23 in 1993 to 12 unemployment at
 146 was still well below forecasts of 17 and the budget deficit
 was around half that in 1993 Slovakias nearly 200 million trade
 surplus also compares favorably with a more than 800 million deficit
 in 1993 Furthermore after contracting almost 25 in the three years
 following 1990 GDP grew 43 in 1994 according to official
 statistics Bratislava in June qualified for a 254 million IMF
 standby loan and the second 90 million tranche of its Systemic
 Transformation Facility and in December received approval for a
 European Union loan worth about 160 million By the end of September
 1994 the Central Banks foreign currency reserves had tripled since
 the end of 1993 Slovakia continued to have difficulty attracting
 foreign investment however because of perceived political
 instability and halting progress in privatization The interim
 government prepared property worth nearly 2 billion for the second
 wave of coupon privatization and sold participation in the program to
 over 80 of Slovakias eligible citizens Parties controlling the new
 Parliament in November 1994 however put the second wave of coupon
 privatization on hold and suspended sales of 38 firms until the new
 government could evaluate the interim governments decisions in early
 1995 The new governments targets for 1995 include GDP growth of 3
 inflation of 810 unemployment of 15 and a budget deficit under
 3 of GDP Continuing economic recovery in western Europe should boost
 Slovak exports and production but Slovakias image with foreign
 creditors and investors could suffer setbacks in 1995 if progress on
 privatization stalls or budget deficits mount beyond IMFrecommended
 levels

SloveniaEconomy

 Overview Slovenia appears to be making a solid economic recovery
 fulfilling the promise it showed at the time of Yugoslavias breakup
 It was by far the most prosperous of the former Yugoslav republics
 with a per capita income more than twice the national average It also
 benefited from strong ties to Western Europe and suffered
 comparatively small physical damage in the dismemberment process The
 beginning was difficult however Real GDP fell 15 during 199192
 while inflation jumped to 247 in 1991 and unemployment topped 8 
 nearly three times the 1989 level The turning point came in 1993 when
 real GDP grew 1 unemployment leveled off at about 9 and inflation
 slowed dramatically to 23 In 1994 the rate of growth of GDP rose to
 4 unemployment remained stable and inflation dropped to 20 This
 was accomplished moreover without balanceofpayments problems The
 government gets generally good economic marks from foreign observers
 particularly with regard to fiscal policy  the budget deficit in 1994
 was only about 1 of GDP following several years of small surpluses
 Prospects for 1995 appear good with economic growth expected to
 remain strong while unemployment and inflation may decline slightly
 Privatization sluggish to date is expected to pick up in 1995

SomaliaEconomy

 Overview One of the worlds poorest and least developed countries
 Somalia has few resources Moreover much of the economy has been
 devastated by the civil war Agriculture is the most important sector
 with livestock accounting for about 40 of GDP and about 65 of export
 earnings Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for
 their livelihood make up about 70 of the population Crop production
 generates only 10 of GDP and employs about 20 of the work force The
 main export crop is bananas sugar sorghum and corn are grown for
 the domestic market The small industrial sector is based on the
 processing of agricultural products and accounts for less than 10 of
 GDP most facilities have been shut down because of the civil strife
 The greatly increased political turmoil of 199193 has resulted in a
 substantial drop in agricultural output with widespread famine In
 1994 economic conditions stabilized in the countryside but may turn
 worse in 1995 if civil strife intensifies after the UN withdrawal

South AfricaEconomy

 Overview Many of the white oneseventh of the South African
 population enjoy incomes material comforts and health and
 educational standards equal to those of Western Europe In contrast
 most of the remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of
 the Third World including unemployment and lack of job skills The
 main strength of the economy lies in its rich mineral resources which
 provide twothirds of exports Economic developments for the remainder
 of the 1990s will be driven largely by the new governments attempts
 to improve black living conditions to set the country on an
 aggressive exportled growth path and to cut back the enormous
 numbers of unemployed The economy in recent years has absorbed less
 than 5 of the more than 300000 workers entering the labor force
 annually Local economists estimate that the economy must grow between
 5 and 6 in real terms annually to absorb all of the new entrants
 much less reduce the accumulated total

SpainEconomy

 Overview Spain with a per capita output approximately twothirds
 that of the four leading economies of Western Europe has shared with
 these countries the recession of the early 1990s and the upturn of
 their economic fortunes in 1994 But whereas unemployment in these
 countries has hovered just above 10 Spain has been forced to cope
 with a 25 unemployment rate Continued political turmoil has
 complicated the establishment of stable government policies toward
 budgetary restraint interest rates labor law reform and Spains
 role in the evolving economic integration of Western Europe Because
 the recession has been so deep the growth in industrial output
 tourism and other sectors in 1994 while welcome falls far short of
 the growth required to bring unemployment down to say 10 The
 recovery in the economies of major trade partners the comparatively
 low inflation rate lower interest rates and prospects in the tourist
 sector suggest that Spain can make substantial progress in 1995

SudanEconomy

 Overview Sudan is buffeted by civil war chronic political
 instability adverse weather high inflation a drop in remittances
 from abroad and counterproductive economic policies Governmental
 entities account for more than 70 of new investment The private
 sectors main areas of activity are agriculture and trading with most
 private industrial investment predating 1980 Agriculture employs 80
 of the work force Industry mainly processes agricultural items
 Sluggish economic performance over the past decade attributable
 largely to declining annual rainfall has reduced levels of per capita
 income and consumption A large foreign debt and huge arrearages
 continue to cause difficulties In 1990 the International Monetary
 Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because
 of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund After Sudan backtracked
 on promised reforms in 199293 the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from
 the Fund To avoid expulsion Khartoum agreed to make payments on its
 arrears to the Fund liberalize exchange rates and reduce subsidies
 These measures have been partially implemented The governments
 continued prosecution of the civil war and its growing international
 isolation led to a further deterioration of the nonagricultural
 sectors of the economy during 1994 Agriculture on the other hand
 after several disappointing years enjoyed a bumper fall harvest in
 1994 its strong performance produced an overall growth rate in GDP of

SwazilandEconomy

 Overview The economy is based on subsistence agriculture which
 occupies more than 60 of the population and contributes nearly 25 to
 GDP Manufacturing which includes a number of agroprocessing
 factories accounts for another quarter of GDP Mining has declined in
 importance in recent years highgrade iron ore deposits were depleted
 by 1978 and health concerns cut world demand for asbestos Exports of
 sugar and forestry products are the main earners of hard currency
 Surrounded by South Africa except for a short border with Mozambique
 Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa from which it receives
 90 of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports
 Remittances from Swazi workers in South African mines may supplement
 domestically produced income by as much as 20

SwedenEconomy

 Overview Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World
 War I through World War II Sweden has achieved an enviable standard
 of living under a mixed system of hightech capitalism and extensive
 welfare benefits It has a modern distribution system excellent
 internal and external communications and a skilled labor force
 Timber hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an
 economy that is heavily oriented toward foreign trade Privately owned
 firms account for about 90 of industrial output of which the
 engineering sector accounts for 50 of output and exports In 1990
 agriculture accounted for only 12 of GDP and 19 of the jobs
 Sweden being about 50 sufficient in most products In the last few
 years however this extraordinarily favorable picture has been
 clouded by inflation growing unemployment and a gradual loss of
 competitiveness in international markets Although Prime Minister
 BILDTs centerright minority coalition had hoped to charge ahead with
 freemarketoriented reforms a skyrocketing budget deficit  about
 14 of GDP in FY9394 projections  and record unemployment have
 forestalled many of the plans Unemployment in 1994 is estimated at
 around 9 with another 5 in job training Continued heavy foreign
 exchange speculation forced the government to cooperate in late 1992
 with the opposition Social Democrats on two crisis packages  one a
 severe austerity pact and the other a program to spur industrial
 competitiveness  which basically set economic policy through 1997 In
 November 1992 Sweden broke its tie to the ECs ECU and the krona has
 since depreciated about 25 against the dollar The boost in export
 competitiveness from the depreciation helped lift Sweden out of its
 3year recession To curb the budget deficit and bolster confidence in
 the economy the new Social Democratic government is proposing cuts in
 welfare benefits subsidies defense and foreign aid Sweden has
 harmonized its economic policies with those of the EU which it joined
 at the start of 1995

SwitzerlandEconomy

 Overview Switzerlands economy  one of the most prosperous and
 stable in the world  is nonetheless undergoing a stressful adjustment
 after both the inflationary boom of the late 1980s and the
 electorates rejection of membership in the European Economic Area
 EEA in 1992 So far the decision to remain outside the European
 single market structure does not appear to have harmed Swiss
 interests In December 1994 the Swiss began bilateral negotiations
 with the EU aimed at establishing closer ties in areas of mutual
 interest and progressing toward the free circulation of persons
 goods capital and services between the two parties The Swiss
 emerged from a threeyear recession in mid1993 and posted 18 GDP
 growth in 1994 The Swiss central banks tight monetary policies
 brought inflation down from about 4 in 1992 to just under 1 in 1994
 Unemployment has fallen slightly from 51 in 1993 to 47 in 1994
 Swiss per capita output living standards education and health care
 remain unsurpassed in Europe The country has few mineral resources
 but its spectacular natural beauty sustains a substantial tourism
 industry

SyriaEconomy

 Overview In 199093 Syrias statedominated Bathist economy
 benefited from the Gulf war increased oil production good weather
 and economic deregulation Economic growth averaged roughly 10 The
 Gulf war provided Syria an aid windfall of nearly 5 billion dollars
 from Arab European and Japanese donors However the benefits of the
 199093 boom were not evenly distributed and the gap between rich and
 poor is widening A nationwide financial scandal and increasing
 inflation were accompanied by a decline in GDP growth to 4 in 1994
 For the long run Syrias economy is still saddled with a large number
 of poorly performing public sector firms and industrial productivity
 remains to be improved Oil production is likely to fall off
 dramatically by the end of the decade Unemployment will become a
 problem for the government when the more than 60 of the population
 under the age of 20 enter the labor force

TajikistanEconomy

 Overview Tajikistan had the nexttolowest per capita GDP in the
 former USSR the highest rate of population growth and an extremely
 low standard of living Agriculture dominates the economy cotton
 being the most important crop Mineral resources varied but limited
 in amount include silver gold uranium and tungsten Industry is
 limited to a large aluminum plant hydropower facilities and small
 obsolete factories mostly in light industry and food processing The
 Tajik economy has been gravely weakened by three years of civil war
 and by the loss of subsidies and markets for its products which has
 left Tajikistan dependent on Russia and Uzbekistan and on
 international humanitarian assistance for much of its basic
 subsistence needs Moreover constant political turmoil and the
 continued dominance by former Communist officials have impeded the
 introduction of meaningful economic reforms In the meantime
 Tajikistans efforts to adopt the Russian ruble as its domestic
 currency despite Russias unwillingness to supply sufficient rubles
 left the country in a severe monetary crisis throughout 1994 keeping
 inflation low but leaving workers and pensioners unpaid for months at
 a time The government has announced plans to introduce its own
 currency in 1995 to help resolve the problem

ThailandEconomy

 Overview Thailands economy recovered rapidly from the political
 unrest in May 1992 to post an impressive 75 growth rate for the
 year 78 in 1993 and 8 in 1994 One of the more advanced
 developing countries in Asia Thailand depends on exports of
 manufactures and the development of the service sector to fuel the
 countrys rapid growth Much of Thailands recent imports have been
 for capital equipment suggesting that the export sector is poised for
 further growth With foreign investment slowing Bangkok is working to
 increase the generation of domestic capital Prime Minister CHUANs
 government  Thailands fifth government in less than three years  is
 pledged to continue Bangkoks probusiness policies and the return of
 a democratically elected government has improved business confidence
 Even so CHUAN must overcome divisions within his ruling coalition to
 complete much needed infrastructure development programs if Thailand
 is to remain an attractive place for business investment Over the
 longerterm Bangkok must produce more college graduates with
 technical training and upgrade workers skills to continue its rapid
 economic development

TogoEconomy

 Overview The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture
 which accounts for about half of GDP and provides employment for 80
 of the labor force Primary agricultural exports are cocoa coffee
 and cotton which together generate about 30 of total export
 earnings Togo is selfsufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests
 are normal In the industrial sector phosphate mining is by far the
 most important activity although it has suffered from the collapse of
 world phosphate prices and increased foreign competition Togo serves
 as a regional commercial and trade center The governments
 decadelong IMF and World Bank supported effort to implement economic
 reform measures to encourage foreign investment and bring revenues in
 line with expenditures has stalled Political unrest including
 private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993 has
 jeopardized the reform program shrunk the tax base and disrupted
 vital economic activity Although strikes had ended in 1994 political
 unrest and lack of funds prevented the government from taking
 advantage of the 50 currency devaluation of January 1994 Resumption
 of World Bank and IMF flows will depend on implementation of several
 controversial moves toward privatization and on downsizing the
 military on which the regime depends to stay in power

TongaEconomy

 Overview The economys base is agriculture which employs about 70
 of the labor force and contributes 40 to GDP Squash coconuts
 bananas and vanilla beans are the main crops and agricultural
 exports make up twothirds of total exports The country must import a
 high proportion of its food mainly from New Zealand The
 manufacturing sector accounts for only 11 of GDP Tourism is the
 primary source of hard currency earnings but the country also remains
 dependent on sizable external aid and remittances to offset its trade
 deficit The economy continued to grow in 199394 largely because of a
 rise in squash exports increased aid flows and several large
 construction projects The government is now turning its attention to
 further development of the private sector and the reduction of the
 budget deficit

TurkeyEconomy

 Overview In early 1995 after an impressive economic performance
 through most of the 1980s Turkey continues to suffer through its most
 damaging economic crisis in the last 15 years Sparked by the
 downgrading in January 1994 of Turkeys international credit rating by
 two US credit rating agencies the crisis stems from years of loose
 fiscal and monetary policies that had exacerbated inflation and
 allowed the public debt money supply and current account deficit to
 explode In April 1994 Prime Minister CILLER introduced an austerity
 package aimed at restoring domestic and international confidence in
 her fragile coalition government Three months later the IMF endorsed
 the program paving the way for a 740 million IMF standby loan
 Although the economy showed signs of improvement following the
 stabilization measures CILLER has been unable to overcome the
 political obstacles to tough structural reforms necessary for
 sustained longerterm growth As a consequence the economy is
 suffering the worst of both worlds at the end of 1994 inflation hit
 a record 126 annual rate and real GDP dropped an estimated 5 for
 the year as a whole the worst decline in Turkeys postwar history
 At the same time the government missed key 1994 targets stipulated in
 the IMF agreement the budget deficit is estimated to have overshot
 the governments goal by 47 the total public sector borrowing
 requirement likely reached 1012 of GDP rather than 85 called for
 in the program and the Turkish liras value fell 5 to 7 more than
 expected The unprecedented effort by the Kurdistan Workers Party
 PKK to raise the economic costs of its insurgency against the
 Turkish state is adding to Turkeys economic problems Attacks against
 tourists have jeopardized tourist revenues which account for about 3
 of GDP while economic activity in southeastern Turkey where most of
 the violence occurs has dropped considerably Turkish officials are
 now negotiating a new letter of intent with the IMF that will
 stipulate more realistic macroeconomic goals for 1995 and allow the
 release of remaining funds of the standby agreement

TurkmenistanEconomy

 Overview Turkmenistan is largely desert country with nomadic cattle
 raising intensive agriculture in irrigated oases and huge gas and
 oil resources Half its irrigated land is planted in cotton making it
 the worlds tenth largest producer It also has the worlds fifth
 largest reserves of natural gas and significant oil resources Until
 the end of 1993 Turkmenistan had experienced less economic disruption
 than other former Soviet states because its economy received a boost
 from higher prices for oil and gas and a sharp increase in hard
 currency earnings In 1994 Russias refusal to export Turkmen gas to
 hard currency markets and mounting debts of its major customers in the
 former USSR for gas deliveries contributed to a sharp fall in
 industrial production and caused the budget to shift from a surplus to
 a slight deficit Furthermore with an authoritarian exCommunist
 regime in power and a triballybased social structure Turkmenistan
 has taken a cautious approach to economic reform hoping to use gas
 and cotton sales to sustain its inefficient economy With the onset of
 economic hard times even cautious moves toward economic restructuring
 and privatization have slowed down For 1995 Turkmenistan will face
 continuing constraints on its earnings because of its customers
 inability to pay for their gas and a low average cotton crop in 1994
 Turkmenistan is working hard to open new gas export channels through
 Iran and Turkey but these may take many years to realize

 quantities of meat milk grain and vegetables to other republics
 Likewise its diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw
 materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the
 former USSR In early 1992 the Ukrainian government liberalized most
 prices and erected a legal framework for privatization but widespread
 resistance to reform within the government and the legislature soon
 stalled reform efforts and led to some backtracking Loose monetary
 and fiscal policies pushed inflation to hyperinflationary levels in
 late 1993 Greater monetary and fiscal restraint lowered inflation in
 1994 but also contributed to an accelerated decline in industrial
 output Since his election in July 1994 President KUCHMA has
 developed  and parliament has approved  a comprehensive economic
 reform program maintained financial discipline and reduced state
 controls over prices the exchange rate and foreign trade
 Implementation of KUCHMAs economic agenda will encounter considerable
 resistance from parliament entrenched bureaucrats and industrial
 interests and will contribute to further declines in output and rising
 unemployment which will sorely test the governments ability to stay
 the course on reform in 1995

United Arab EmiratesEconomy

 Overview The UAE has an open economy with one of the worlds highest
 incomes per capita and with a sizable annual trade surplus Its wealth
 is based on oil and gas output about 40 of GDP and the fortunes of
 the economy fluctuate with the prices of those commodities Since
 1973 the UAE has undergone a profound transformation from an
 impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state
 with a high standard of living At present levels of production crude
 oil reserves should last for over 100 years Although much stronger
 economically than most Gulf states the UAE faces similar problems
 with weak international oil prices and the pressures for cuts in OPEC
 oil production quotas The UAE government is encouraging increased
 privatization within the economy

United KingdomEconomy

 Overview The UK is one of the worlds great trading powers and
 financial centers and its economy ranks among the four largest in
 Western Europe The economy is essentially capitalistic over the past
 13 years the ruling Tories have greatly reduced public ownership and
 contained the growth of social welfare programs Agriculture is
 intensive highly mechanized and efficient by European standards
 producing about 60 of food needs with only 1 of the labor force The
 UK has large coal natural gas and oil reserves and primary energy
 production accounts for 12 of GDP one of the highest shares of any
 industrial nation Services particularly banking insurance and
 business services account by far for the largest proportion of GDP
 while industry continues to decline in importance now employing only
 25 of the work force and generating only 21 of GDP The economy
 registered 42 GDP growth in 1994 its fastest annual rate for six
 years Exports and manufacturing output are the primary engines of
 growth Unemployment is gradually falling Inflation is at the lowest
 level in 27 years but British monetary authorities raised interest
 rates to 625 in 1994 in a preemptive strike on emerging inflationary
 pressures such as higher taxes and rising manufacturing costs The
 combination of a buoyant economy and fiscal tightening is projected to
 trim the FY9495 budget shortfall to about 50 billion  down from
 about 75 billion in FY9394 The major economic policy question for
 Britain in the 1990s is the terms on which it participates in the
 financial and economic integration of Europe

United StatesEconomy

 Overview The US has the most powerful diverse and technologically
 advanced economy in the world with a per capita GDP of 25850 the
 largest among major industrial nations The economy is market oriented
 with most decisions made by private individuals and business firms and
 with government purchases of goods and services made predominantly in
 the marketplace In 1989 the economy enjoyed its seventh successive
 year of substantial growth the longest in peacetime history The
 expansion featured moderation in wage and consumer price increases and
 a steady reduction in unemployment to 52 of the labor force In
 1990 however growth slowed to 1 because of a combination of
 factors such as the worldwide increase in interest rates Iraqs
 invasion of Kuwait in August the subsequent spurt in oil prices and
 a general decline in business and consumer confidence In 1991 output
 fell by 06 unemployment grew and signs of recovery proved
 premature Growth picked up to 23 in 1992 and to 31 in 1993
 Unemployment however declined only gradually the increase in GDP
 being mainly attributable to gains in output per worker The year 1994
 witnessed a solid 4 gain in real output a low inflation rate of
 26 and a drop in unemployment below 6 The capture of both houses
 of Congress by the Republicans in the elections of 8 November 1994
 means substantial changes are likely in US economic policy including
 changes in the ways the US will address its major economic problems in
 199596 These problems include inadequate investment in economic
 infrastructure rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population
 and sizable budget and trade deficits

UruguayEconomy

 Overview Uruguays economy is a small one with favorable climate
 good soils and substantial hydropower potential Economic development
 has been restrained in recent years by excessive government regulation
 of economic detail and 40 to 130 inflation Although the GDP growth
 rate slowed in 1993 to 17 following a healthy expansion to 75 in
 1992 it rebounded in 1994 to an estimated 4 spurred mostly by
 increasing agricultural and other exports and a surprise reversal of
 the downward trend in industrial production In a major step toward
 regional economic cooperation Uruguay confirmed its commitment to the
 Southern Cone Common Market MERCOSUR customs union by implementing
 MERCOSURs common external tariff on most tradables on 1 January 1995
 Inflation in 1994 declined for the third consecutive year yet at
 44 it remains the highest in the region analysts predict that the
 expanding fiscal deficit and wage indexation will force the inflation
 rate back toward the 50 mark in 1995

UzbekistanEconomy

 Overview Uzbekistan is a dry landlocked country of which 10
 consists of intensely cultivated irrigated river valleys It is one
 of the poorest states of the former USSR with 60 of its population
 living in overpopulated rural communities Nevertheless Uzbekistan is
 the worlds third largest cotton exporter a major producer of gold
 and natural gas and a regionally significant producer of chemicals
 and machinery Since independence the government has sought to prop
 up the Sovietstyle command economy with subsidies and tight controls
 on prices and production Such policies have buffered the economy from
 the sharp declines in output and high inflation experienced by many
 other former Soviet republics They had become increasingly
 unsustainable however as inflation moves along at 14 per month and
 as Russia has forced the Uzbek government to introduce its own
 currency Faced with mounting economic problems the government has
 begun to move on a reform agenda and cooperate with international
 financial institutions announced an acceleration of privatization
 and stepped up efforts to attract foreign investors Nevertheless the
 regime is likely to find it difficult to sustain its drive for
 economic reform

VenezuelaEconomy

 Overview Despite efforts to broaden the base of the economy
 petroleum continues to play a dominant role In 1994 as GDP declined
 33 the oil sector  which accounts for 24 of the total  enjoyed a
 6 expansion provided 45 of the budget revenues and generated 70
 of the export earnings President CALDERA who assumed office in
 February 1994 has used an interventionist reactive approach to
 managing the economy instituting price and foreign exchange controls
 in midyear to slow inflation and stop the loss of foreign exchange
 reserves The government claims it will remove these controls once
 inflationary pressures abate but the 8 billion bailout of the
 banking sector in 1994 has made it difficult for the government to
 make good on its promise Economic controls coupled with political
 uncertainty driven by recurrent coup rumors continue to deter foreign
 and domestic investment private forecasters see the recession
 persisting for a third year in 1995

VietnamEconomy

 Overview Vietnam has made significant progress in recent years moving
 away from the planned economic model toward a more effective
 marketbased economic system Most prices are now fully decontrolled
 and the Vietnamese currency has been effectively devalued and floated
 at world market rates In addition the scope for private sector
 activity has been expanded primarily through decollectivization of
 the agricultural sector and introduction of laws giving legal
 recognition to private business Nearly threequarters of export
 earnings are generated by only two commodities rice and crude oil
 Led by industry and construction the economy did well in 1993 and
 1994 with output rising 7 and 9 respectively However the
 industrial sector remains burdened by noncompetitive stateowned
 enterprises the government is unwilling or unable to privatize
 Unemployment looms as a serious problem with roughly 20 of the work
 force without jobs and with population growth swelling the ranks of
 the labor force yearly

West BankEconomy

 Overview Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by
 Israeli military administration and the effects of the Palestinian
 uprising intifadah Industries using advanced technology or
 requiring sizable investment have been discouraged by a lack of local
 capital and restrictive Israeli policies Capital investment consists
 largely of residential housing not productive assets that would
 enable local Palestinian firms to compete with Israeli industry GDP
 has been substantially supplemented by remittances of workers employed
 in Israel and Persian Gulf states Such transfers from the Gulf
 dropped after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 In the wake of the
 Persian Gulf crisis many Palestinians have returned to the West Bank
 increasing unemployment and export revenues have dropped because of
 the decline of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states Israeli measures
 to curtail the intifadah also have added to unemployment and lowered
 living standards The areas economic situation has worsened since
 Israels partial closure of the territories in 1993

Western SamoaEconomy

 Overview Agriculture employs more than half of the labor force
 contributes 50 to GDP and furnishes 90 of exports The bulk of
 export earnings comes from the sale of coconut oil and copra The
 economy depends on emigrant remittances and foreign aid to support a
 level of imports much greater than export earnings Tourism has become
 the most important growth industry The economy continued to falter in
 1994 as remittances and tourist earnings remained low Production of
 taro the primary food export crop has dropped 97 since a fungal
 disease struck the crop in 1993 The rapid growth in 1994 of the giant
 African snail population in Western Samoa is also threatening the

WorldEconomy

 Overview Led by recovery in Western Europe and strong performances by
 the US Canada and key Third World countries real global output 
 gross world product GWP  rose 3 in 1994 compared with 2 in 1993
 Results varied widely among regions and countries Average growth of
 3 in the GDP of industrialized countries 60 of GWP in 1994 and
 average growth of 6 in the GDP of less developed countries 34 of
 GWP were partly offset by a further 11 drop in the GDP of the former
 USSREastern Europe area now only 6 of GWP With the notable
 exception of Japan at 29 unemployment was typically 512 in the
 industrial world The US accounted for 22 of GWP in 1994 Western
 Europe accounted for another 22 and Japan accounted for 8 These
 are the three economic superpowers which are presumably destined to
 compete for mastery in international markets on into the 21st century
 As for the less developed countries China India and the Four
 Dragons  South Korea Taiwan Hong Kong and Singapore  once again
 posted records of 5 growth or better however many other countries
 especially in Africa continued to suffer from drought rapid
 population growth inflation and civil strife Central Europe made
 considerable progress in moving toward marketfriendly economies
 whereas the 15 exSoviet countries with the notable exceptions of the
 three Baltic states typically experienced further declines in output
 sometimes as high as 30 Externally the nationstate as a bedrock
 economicpolitical institution is steadily losing control over
 international flows of people goods funds and technology
 Internally the central government in a number of cases is losing
 control over resources as separatist regional movements  typically
 based on ethnicity  gain momentum eg in the successor states of
 the former Soviet Union in the former Yugoslavia and in India In
 Western Europe governments face the difficult political problem of
 channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase
 investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment The addition
 of nearly 100 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe
 is exacerbating the problems of pollution desertification
 underemployment epidemics and famine Because of their own internal
 problems the industrialized countries have inadequate resources to
 deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least
 from the economic point of view are becoming further marginalized

 Industries industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of
 technology especially in computers robotics telecommunications and
 medicines and medical equipment most of these advances take place in
 OECD nations only a small portion of nonOECD countries have
 succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these technological forces and the
 technological gap between the industrial nations and the
 lessdeveloped countries continues to widen the rapid development of
 new industrial and agricultural technology is complicating already
 grim environmental problems

 Agriculture the production of major food crops has increased
 substantially in the last 20 years the annual production of cereals
 for instance has risen by 50 from about 12 billion metric tons to
 about 18 billion metric tons production increases have resulted
 mainly from increased yields rather than increases in planted areas
 while global production is sufficient for aggregate demand about
 onefifth of the worlds population remains malnourished primarily
 because local production cannot adequately provide for large and
 rapidly growing populations which are too poor to pay for food
 imports conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in
 recent years has intensified the consequences of overpopulation

YemenEconomy

 Overview Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of
 a united Yemen the southern city Aden with its refinery and port
 facilities is the economic and commercial capital Future economic
 development depends heavily on Westernassisted development of the
 countrys moderate oil resources Former South Yemens willingness to
 merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet economic
 support The low level of domestic industry and agriculture has made
 northern Yemen dependent on imports for practically all of its
 essential needs Once selfsufficient in food production northern
 Yemen has become a major importer Land once used for export crops 
 cotton fruit and vegetables  has been turned over to growing a
 shrub called qat whose leaves are chewed for their stimulant effect
 by Yemenis and which has no significant export market Economic growth
 in former South Yemen has been constrained by a lack of incentives
 partly stemming from centralized control over production decisions
 investment allocation and import choices Yemens large trade
 deficits have been compensated for by remittances from Yemenis working
 abroad and by foreign aid Since the Gulf crisis remittances have
 dropped substantially Growth in 199495 is constrained by low oil
 prices rapid inflation and political deadlock that are causing a
 lack of economic cooperation and leadership However a peace
 agreement with Saudi Arabia in February 1995 and the expectation of a
 rise in oil prices brighten Yemens economic prospects

ZaireEconomy

 Overview Zaires economy has continued to disintegrate although Prime
 Minister KENGO has had some success in slowing the rate of economic
 decline While meaningful economic figures are difficult to come by
 Zaires hyperinflation chronic large government deficits and
 plunging mineral production have made the country one of the worlds
 poorest Most formal transactions are conducted in hard currency as
 indigenous bank notes have lost almost all value and a barter economy
 now flourishes in all but the largest cities Most individuals and
 families hang on grimly through subsistence farming and petty trade
 The government has not been able to meet its financial obligations to
 the International Monetary Fund or put in place the financial measures
 advocated by the IMF Although shortterm prospects for improvement
 are dim improved political stability would boost Zaires longterm
 potential to effectively exploit its vast wealth of mineral and
 agricultural resources

ZambiaEconomy

 Overview Prior to 1993 the economy had been in decline for more than
 a decade with falling imports and growing foreign debt Economic
 difficulties stemmed largely from a chronically depressed level of
 copper production and weak copper prices generally ineffective
 economic policies and high inflation An annual population growth of
 3 brought a decline in per capita GDP of 50 over the decade
 However economic reforms enacted since 1992 have helped reduce
 inflation have begun to strengthen the social safety net and have
 been accompanied by GDP growth at an estimated 68 in 1993 and 4 in
 1994 The huge external debt remains a key problem

International Organizations and Groups

 Note The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia SFRY has
 dissolved and ceases to exist None of the successor states of the
 former Yugoslavia including Serbia and Montenegro have been
 permitted to participate solely on the basis of the membership of the
 former Yugoslavia in the United Nations General Assembly and Economic
 and Social Council and their subsidiary bodies and in various United
 Nations specialized agencies The United Nations however permits the
 seat and nameplate of the SFRY to remain permits the SFRY mission to
 continue to function and continues to fly the flag of the former
 Yugoslavia For a variety of reasons a number of other organizations
 have not yet taken action with regard to the membership of the former
 Yugoslavia The World Factbook therefore continues to list Yugoslavia
 under international organizations where the SFRY seat remains or where
 no action has yet been taken

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
