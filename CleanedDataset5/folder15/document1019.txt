PILATES WIFES DREAM

 Ive quenchd my lamp I struck it in that start
 Which every limb convulsed I heard it fall
 The crash blent with my sleep I saw depart
 Its light even as I woke on yonder wall
 Over against my bed there shone a gleam
 Strange faint and mingling also with my dream

 It sank and I am wrapt in utter gloom
 How far is night advanced and when will day
 Retinge the dusk and livid air with bloom
 And fill this void with warm creative ray
 Would I could sleep again till clear and red
 Morning shall on the mountaintops be spread

 Id call my women but to break their sleep
 Because my own is broken were unjust
 Theyve wrought all day and wellearnd slumbers steep
 Their labours in forgetfulness I trust
 Let me my feverish watch with patience bear
 Thankful that none with me its sufferings share

 Yet oh for light one ray would tranquillize
 My nerves my pulses more than effort can
 Ill draw my curtain and consult the skies
 These trembling stars at dead of night look wan
 Wild restless strange yet cannot be more drear
 Than this my couch shared by a nameless fear

 All blackone great cloud drawn from east to west
 Conceals the heavens but there are lights below
 Torches burn in Jerusalem and cast
 On yonder stony mount a lurid glow
 I see men stationd there and gleaming spears
 A sound too from afar invades my ears

 Dull measured strokes of axe and hammer ring
 From street to street not loud but through the night
 Distinctly heardand some strange spectral thing
 Is now upreardand fixd against the light
 Of the pale lamps defined upon that sky
 It stands up like a column straight and high

 I see it allI know the dusky sign
 A cross on Calvary which Jews uprear
 While Romans watch and when the dawn shall shine
 Pilate to judge the victim will appear
 Pass sentenceyield Him up to crucify
 And on that cross the spotless Christ must die

 Dreams then are truefor thus my vision ran
 Surely some oracle has been with me
 The gods have chosen me to reveal their plan
 To warn an unjust judge of destiny
 I slumbering heard and saw awake I know
 Christs coming death and Pilates life of woe

 I do not weep for Pilatewho could prove
 Regret for him whose cold and crushing sway
 No prayer can soften no appeal can move
 Who tramples hearts as others trample clay
 Yet with a faltering an uncertain tread
 That might stir up reprisal in the dead

 Forced to sit by his side and see his deeds
 Forced to behold that visage hour by hour
 In whose gaunt lines the abhorrent gazer reads
 A triple lust of gold and blood and power
 A soul whom motives fierce yet abject urge
 Romes servile slave and Judahs tyrant scourge

 How can I love or mourn or pity him
 I who so long my fetterd hands have wrung
 I who for grief have wept my eyesight dim
 Because while life for me was bright and young
 He robbd my youthhe quenchd my lifes fair ray
 He crushd my mind and did my freedom slay

 And at this houralthough I be his wife
 He has no more of tenderness from me
 Than any other wretch of guilty life
 Less for I know his household privacy
 I see him as he iswithout a screen
 And by the gods my soul abhors his mien

 Has he not sought my presence dyed in blood
 Innocent righteous blood shed shamelessly
 And have I not his red salute withstood
 Ay when as erst he plunged all Galilee
 In dark bereavementin affliction sore
 Mingling their very offerings with their gore

 Then came hein his eyes a serpentsmile
 Upon his lips some false endearing word
 And through the streets of Salem clangd the while
 His slaughtering hacking sacrilegious sword
 And I to see a man cause men such woe
 Trembled with ireI did not fear to show

 And now the envious Jewish priests have brought
 Jesuswhom they in mockry call their king
 To have by this grim power their vengeance wrought
 By this mean reptile innocence to sting
 Oh could I but the purposed doom avert
 And shield the blameless head from cruel hurt

 Accessible is Pilates heart to fear
 Omens will shake his soul like autumn leaf
 Could he this nights appalling vision hear
 This just mans bonds were loosed his life were safe
 Unless that bitter priesthood should prevail
 And make even terror to their malice quail

 Yet if I tell the dreambut let me pause
 What dream Erewhile the characters were clear
 Graved on my brainat once some unknown cause
 Has dimmd and razed the thoughts which now appear
 Like a vague remnant of some bypast scene
 Not what will be but what long since has been

 I sufferd many thingsI heard foretold
 A dreadful doom for Pilatelingering woes
 In far barbarian climes where mountains cold
 Built up a solitude of trackless snows
 There he and grisly wolves prowld side by side
 There he lived famishdthere methought he died

 But not of hunger nor by malady
 I saw the snow around him staind with gore
 I said I had no tears for such as he
 And lo my cheek is wetmine eyes run oer
 I weep for mortal suffering mortal guilt
 I weep the impious deed the blood selfspilt

 More I recall not yet the vision spread
 Into a world remote an age to come
 And still the illumined name of Jesus shed
 A light a clearness through the unfolding gloom
 And still I saw that sign which now I see
 That cross on yonder brow of Calvary

 What is this Hebrew Christto me unknown
 His lineagedoctrinemission yet how clear
 Is Godlike goodness in his actions shown
 How straight and stainless is his lifes career
 The ray of Deity that rests on him
 In my eyes makes Olympian glory dim

 The world advances Greek or Roman rite
 Suffices not the inquiring mind to stay
 The searching soul demands a purer light
 To guide it on its upward onward way
 Ashamed of sculptured gods Religion turns
 To where the unseen Jehovahs altar burns

 Our faith is rotten all our rites defiled
 Our temples sullied and methinks this man
 With his new ordinance so wise and mild
 Is come even as He says the chaff to fan
 And sever from the wheat but will his faith
 Survive the terrors of tomorrows death

       

 I feel a firmer trusta higher hope
 Rise in my soulit dawns with dawning day
 Lo on the Temples roofon Moriahs slope
 Appears at length that clear and crimson ray
 Which I so wished for when shut in by night
 Oh opening skies I hail I bless pour light

 Part clouds and shadows Glorious Sun appear
 Part mental gloom Come insight from on high
 Dusk dawn in heaven still strives with daylight clear
 The longing soul doth still uncertain sigh
 Oh to behold the truththat sun divine
 How doth my bosom pant my spirit pine

 This day Time travails with a mighty birth
 This day Truth stoops from heaven and visits earth
 Ere night descends I shall more surely know
 What guide to follow in what path to go
 I wait in hopeI wait in solemn fear
 The oracle of Godthe soletrue Godto hear




MEMENTOS

 Arranging longlocked drawers and shelves
 Of cabinets shut up for years
 What a strange task weve set ourselves
 How still the lonely room appears
 How strange this mass of ancient treasures
 Mementos of past pains and pleasures
 These volumes clasped with costly stone
 With print all faded gilding gone

 These fans of leaves from Indian trees
 These crimson shells from Indian seas
 These tiny portraits set in rings
 Once doubtless deemed such precious things
 Keepsakes bestowed by Love on Faith
 And worn till the receivers death
 Now stored with cameos china shells
 In this old closets dusty cells

 I scarcely think for ten long years
 A hand has touched these relics old
 And coating each slowformed appears
 The growth of green and antique mould

 All in this house is mossing over
 All is unused and dim and damp
 Nor light nor warmth the rooms discover
 Bereft for years of fire and lamp

 The sun sometimes in summer enters
 The casements with reviving ray
 But the long rains of many winters
 Moulder the very walls away

 And outside all is ivy clinging
 To chimney lattice gable grey
 Scarcely one little red rose springing
 Through the green moss can force its way

 Unscared the daw and starling nestle
 Where the tall turret rises high
 And winds alone come near to rustle
 The thick leaves where their cradles lie

 I sometimes think when late at even
 I climb the stair reluctantly
 Some shape that should be well in heaven
 Or ill elsewhere will pass by me

 I fear to see the very faces
 Familiar thirty years ago
 Even in the old accustomed places
 Which look so cold and gloomy now

 Ive come to close the window hither
 At twilight when the sun was down
 And Fear my very soul would wither
 Lest something should be dimly shown

 Too much the buried form resembling
 Of her who once was mistress here
 Lest doubtful shade or moonbeam trembling
 Might take her aspect once so dear

 Hers was this chamber in her time
 It seemed to me a pleasant room
 For then no cloud of grief or crime
 Had cursed it with a settled gloom

 I had not seen deaths image laid
 In shroud and sheet on yonder bed
 Before she married she was blest
 Blest in her youth blest in her worth
 Her mind was calm its sunny rest
 Shone in her eyes more clear than mirth

 And when attired in rich array
 Light lustrous hair about her brow
 She yonder sat a kind of day
 Lit up what seems so gloomy now
 These grim oak walls even then were grim
 That old carved chair was then antique
 But what around looked dusk and dim
 Served as a foil to her fresh cheek
 Her neck and arms of hue so fair
 Eyes of unclouded smiling light
 Her soft and curled and floating hair
 Gems and attire as rainbow bright

 Reclined in yonder deep recess
 Ofttimes she would at evening lie
 Watching the sun she seemed to bless
 With happy glance the glorious sky
 She loved such scenes and as she gazed
 Her face evinced her spirits mood
 Beauty or grandeur ever raised
 In her a deepfelt gratitude
 But of all lovely things she loved
 A cloudless moon on summer night
 Full oft have I impatience proved
 To see how long her still delight
 Would find a theme in reverie
 Out on the lawn or where the trees
 Let in the lustre fitfully
 As their boughs parted momently
 To the soft languid summer breeze
 Alas that she should eer have flung
 Those pure though lonely joys away
 Deceived by false and guileful tongue
 She gave her hand then suffered wrong
 Oppressed illused she faded young
 And died of grief by slow decay

 Open that casketlook how bright
 Those jewels flash upon the sight
 The brilliants have not lost a ray
 Of lustre since her wedding day
 But seeupon that pearly chain
 How dim lies Times discolouring stain
 Ive seen that by her daughter worn
 For ere she died a child was born
 A child that neer its mother knew
 That lone and almost friendless grew
 For ever when its step drew nigh
 Averted was the fathers eye
 And then a life impure and wild
 Made him a stranger to his child
 Absorbed in vice he little cared
 On what she did or how she fared
 The love withheld she never sought
 She grew uncherishedlearnt untaught
 To her the inward life of thought
 Full soon was open laid
 I know not if her friendlessness
 Did sometimes on her spirit press
 But plaint she never made
 The bookshelves were her darling treasure
 She rarely seemed the time to measure
 While she could read alone
 And she too loved the twilight wood
 And often in her mothers mood
 Away to yonder hill would hie
 Like her to watch the setting sun
 Or see the stars born one by one
 Out of the darkening sky
 Nor would she leave that hill till night
 Trembled from pole to pole with light
 Even then upon her homeward way
 Longlong her wandering steps delayed
 To quit the sombre forest shade
 Through which her eerie pathway lay
 You ask if she had beautys grace
 I know notbut a nobler face
 My eyes have seldom seen
 A keen and fine intelligence
 And better still the truest sense
 Were in her speaking mien
 But bloom or lustre was there none
 Only at moments fitful shone
 An ardour in her eye
 That kindled on her cheek a flush
 Warm as a red skys passing blush
 And quick with energy
 Her speech too was not common speech
 No wish to shine or aim to teach
 Was in her words displayed
 She still began with quiet sense
 But oft the force of eloquence
 Came to her lips in aid
 Language and voice unconscious changed
 And thoughts in other words arranged
 Her fervid soul transfused
 Into the hearts of those who heard
 And transient strength and ardour stirred
 In minds to strength unused
 Yet in gay crowd or festal glare
 Grave and retiring was her air
 Twas seldom save with me alone
 That fire of feeling freely shone
 She loved not awes nor wonders gaze
 Nor even exaggerated praise
 Nor even notice if too keen
 The curious gazer searched her mien
 Natures own green expanse revealed
 The world the pleasures she could prize
 On free hillside in sunny field
 In quiet spots by woods concealed
 Grew wild and fresh her chosen joys
 Yet Natures feelings deeply lay
 In that endowed and youthful frame
 Shrined in her heart and hid from day
 They burned unseen with silent flame
 In youths first search for mental light
 She lived but to reflect and learn
 But soon her minds maturer might
 For stronger task did pant and yearn
 And stronger task did fate assign
 Task that a giants strength might strain
 To suffer long and neer repine
 Be calm in frenzy smile at pain

 Pale with the secret war of feeling
 Sustained with courage mute yet high
 The wounds at which she bled revealing
 Only by altered cheek and eye

 She bore in silencebut when passion
 Surged in her soul with ceaseless foam
 The storm at last brought desolation
 And drove her exiled from her home

 And silent still she straight assembled
 The wrecks of strength her soul retained
 For though the wasted body trembled
 The unconquered mind to quail disdained

 She crossed the seanow lone she wanders
 By Seines or Rhines or Arnos flow
 Fain would I know if distance renders
 Relief or comfort to her woe

 Fain would I know if henceforth ever
 These eyes shall read in hers again
 That light of love which faded never
 Though dimmed so long with secret pain

 She will return but cold and altered
 Like all whose hopes too soon depart
 Like all on whom have beat unsheltered
 The bitter blasts that blight the heart

 No more shall I behold her lying
 Calm on a pillow smoothed by me
 No more that spirit worn with sighing
 Will know the rest of infancy

 If still the paths of lore she follow
 Twill be with tired and goaded will
 Shell only toil the aching hollow
 The joyless blank of life to fill

 And oh full oft quite spent and weary
 Her hand will pause her head decline
 That labour seems so hard and dreary
 On which no ray of hope may shine

 Thus the pale blight of time and sorrow
 Will shade with grey her soft dark hair
 Then comes the day that knows no morrow
 And death succeeds to long despair

 So speaks experience sage and hoary
 I see it plainly know it well
 Like one who having read a story
 Each incident therein can tell

 Touch not that ring twas his the sire
 Of that forsaken child
 And nought his relics can inspire
 Save memories sindefiled

 I who sat by his wifes deathbed
 I who his daughter loved
 Could almost curse the guilty dead
 For woes the guiltless proved

 And heaven did cursethey found him laid
 When crime for wrath was rife
 Coldwith the suicidal blade
 Clutched in his desperate gripe

 Twas near that long deserted hut
 Which in the wood decays
 Deaths axe selfwielded struck his root
 And lopped his desperate days

 You know the spot where three black trees
 Lift up their branches fell
 And moaning ceaseless as the seas
 Still seem in every passing breeze
 The deed of blood to tell

 They named him mad and laid his bones
 Where holier ashes lie
 Yet doubt not that his spirit groans
 In hells eternity

 But lo night closing oer the earth
 Infects our thoughts with gloom
 Come let us strive to rally mirth
 Where glows a clear and tranquil hearth
 In some more cheerful room




THE WIFES WILL

 Sit stilla worda breath may break
 As light airs stir a sleeping lake
 The glassy calm that soothes my woes
 The sweet the deep the full repose
 O leave me not for ever be
 Thus more than life itself to me

 Yes close beside thee let me kneel
 Give me thy hand that I may feel
 The friend so trueso triedso dear
 My hearts own chosenindeed is near
 And check me notthis hour divine
 Belongs to meis fully mine

 Tis thy own hearth thou sittst beside
 After long absencewandering wide
 Tis thy own wife reads in thine eyes
 A promise clear of stormless skies
 For faith and true love light the rays
 Which shine responsive to her gaze

 Aywell that single tear may fall
 Ten thousand might mine eyes recall
 Which from their lids ran blinding fast
 In hours of grief yet scarcely past
 Well mayst thou speak of love to me
 For oh most trulyI love thee

 Yet smilefor we are happy now
 Whence then that sadness on thy brow
 What sayst thou We muse once again
 Ere long be severed by the main
 I knew not thisI deemed no more
 Thy step would err from Britains shore

 Duty commands Tis truetis just
 Thy slightest word I wholly trust
 Nor by request nor faintest sigh
 Would I to turn thy purpose try
 But William hear my solemn vow
 Hear and confirmwith thee I go

 Distance and suffering didst thou say
 Danger by night and toil by day
 Oh idle words and vain are these
 Hear me I cross with thee the seas
 Such risk as thou must meet and dare
 Ithy true wifewill duly share

 Passive at home I will not pine
 Thy toils thy perils shall be mine
 Grant thisand be hereafter paid
 By a warm hearts devoted aid
 Tis grantedwith that yielding kiss
 Entered my soul unmingled bliss

 Thanks William thanks thy love has joy
 Pure undefiled with base alloy
 Tis not a passion false and blind
 Inspires enchains absorbs my mind
 Worthy I feel art thou to be
 Loved with my perfect energy

 This evening now shall sweetly flow
 Lit by our clear fires happy glow
 And partings peaceembittering fear
 Is warned our hearts to come not near
 For fate admits my souls decree
 In bliss or baleto go with thee


 THE WOOD

 But two miles more and then we rest
 Well there is still an hour of day
 And long the brightness of the West
 Will light us on our devious way
 Sit then awhile here in this wood
 So total is the solitude
 We safely may delay

 These massive roots afford a seat
 Which seems for weary travellers made
 There rest The air is soft and sweet
 In this sequestered forest glade
 And there are scents of flowers around
 The evening dew draws from the ground
 How soothingly they spread

 Yes I was tired but not at heart
 Nothat beats full of sweet content
 For now I have my natural part
 Of action with adventure blent
 Cast forth on the wide world with thee
 And all my once waste energy
 To weighty purpose bent

 Yetsayst thou spies around us roam
 Our aims are termed conspiracy
 Haply no more our English home
 An anchorage for us may be
 That there is risk our mutual blood
 May redden in some lonely wood
 The knife of treachery

 Sayst thou that where we lodge each night
 In each lone farm or lonelier hall
 Of Norman Peerere morning light
 Suspicion must as duly fall
 As day returnssuch vigilance
 Presides and watches over France
 Such rigour governs all

 I fear not William dost thou fear
 So that the knife does not divide
 It may be ever hovering near
 I could not tremble at thy side
 And strenuous lovelike mine for thee
 Is buckler strong gainst treachery
 And turns its stab aside

 I am resolved that thou shalt learn
 To trust my strength as I trust thine
 I am resolved our souls shall burn
 With equal steady mingling shine
 Part of the field is conquered now
 Our lives in the same channel flow
 Along the selfsame line

 And while no groaning storm is heard
 Thou seemst content it should be so
 But soon as comes a warning word
 Of dangerstraight thine anxious brow
 Bends over me a mournful shade
 As doubting if my powers are made
 To ford the floods of woe

 Know then it is my spirit swells
 And drinks with eager joy the air
 Of freedomwhere at last it dwells
 Chartered a common task to share
 With thee and then it stirs alert
 And pants to learn what menaced hurt
 Demands for thee its care

 Remember I have crossed the deep
 And stood with thee on deck to gaze
 On waves that rose in threatening heap
 While stagnant lay a heavy haze
 Dimly confusing sea with sky
 And baffling even the pilots eye
 Intent to thread the maze

 Of rocks on Bretagnes dangerous coast
 And find a way to steer our band
 To the one point obscure which lost
 Flung us as victims on the strand
 All elsewhere gleamed the Gallic sword
 And not a wherry could be moored
 Along the guarded land

 I feared not thenI fear not now
 The interest of each stirring scene
 Wakes a new sense a welcome glow
 In every nerve and bounding vein
 Alike on turbid Channel sea
 Or in still wood of Normandy
 I feel as born again

 The rain descended that wild morn
 When anchoring in the cove at last
 Our band all weary and forlorn
 Ashore like waveworn sailors cast
 Sought for a sheltering roof in vain
 And scarce could scanty food obtain
 To break their morning fast

 Thou didst thy crust with me divide
 Thou didst thy cloak around me fold
 And sitting silent by thy side
 I ate the bread in peace untold
 Given kindly from thy hand twas sweet
 As costly fare or princely treat
 On royal plate of gold

 Sharp blew the sleet upon my face
 And rising wild the gusty wind
 Drove on those thundering waves apace
 Our crew so late had left behind
 But spite of frozen shower and storm
 So close to thee my heart beat warm
 And tranquil slept my mind

 So nownor footsore nor opprest
 With walking all this August day
 I taste a heaven in this brief rest
 This gipsyhalt beside the way
 Englands wild flowers are fair to view
 Like balm is Englands summer dew
 Like gold her sunset ray

 But the white violets growing here
 Are sweeter than I yet have seen
 And neer did dew so pure and clear
 Distil on forest mosses green
 As now called forth by summer heat
 Perfumes our cool and fresh retreat
 These fragrant limes between

 That sunset Look beneath the boughs
 Over the copsebeyond the hills
 How soft yet deep and warm it glows
 And heaven with rich suffusion fills
 With hues where still the opals tint
 Its gleam of prisoned fire is blent
 Where flame through azure thrills

 Depart we nowfor fast will fade
 That solemn splendour of decline
 And deep must be the aftershade
 As stars alone tonight will shine
 No moon is destinedpaleto gaze
 On such a days vast Phoenix blaze
 A day in fires decayed

 Therehandinhand we tread again
 The mazes of this varying wood
 And soon amid a cultured plain
 Girt in with fertile solitude
 We shall our restingplace descry
 Marked by one rooftree towering high
 Above a farmstead rude

 Refreshed erelong with rustic fare
 Well seek a couch of dreamless ease
 Courage will guard thy heart from fear
 And Love give mine divinest peace
 Tomorrow brings more dangerous toil
 And through its conflict and turmoil
 Well pass as God shall please

 The preceding composition refers doubtless to the scenes
 acted in France during the last year of the Consulate




FRANCES

 She will not sleep for fear of dreams
 But rising quits her restless bed
 And walks where some beclouded beams
 Of moonlight through the hall are shed

 Obedient to the goad of grief
 Her steps now fast now lingering slow
 In varying motion seek relief
 From the Eumenides of woe

 Wringing her hands at intervals
 But long as mute as phantom dim
 She glides along the dusky walls
 Under the black oak rafters grim

 The close air of the grated tower
 Stifles a heart that scarce can beat
 And though so late and lone the hour
 Forth pass her wandering faltering feet

 And on the pavement spread before
 The long front of the mansion grey
 Her steps imprint the nightfrost hoar
 Which pale on grass and granite lay

 Not long she stayed where misty moon
 And shimmering stars could on her look
 But through the garden archway soon
 Her strange and gloomy path she took

 Some firs coeval with the tower
 Their straight black boughs stretched oer her head
 Unseen beneath this sable bower
 Rustled her dress and rapid tread

 There was an alcove in that shade
 Screening a rustic seat and stand
 Weary she sat her down and laid
 Her hot brow on her burning hand

 To solitude and to the night
 Some words she now in murmurs said
 And trickling through her fingers white
 Some tears of misery she shed

 God help me in my grievous need
 God help me in my inward pain
 Which cannot ask for pitys meed
 Which has no licence to complain

 Which must be borne yet who can bear
 Hours long days long a constant weight
 The yoke of absolute despair
 A suffering wholly desolate

 Who can for ever crush the heart
 Restrain its throbbing curb its life
 Dissemble truth with ceaseless art
 With outward calm mask inward strife

 She waitedas for some reply
 The still and cloudy night gave none
 Ere long with deepdrawn trembling sigh
 Her heavy plaint again begun

 UnlovedI love unweptI weep
 Grief I restrainhope I repress
 Vain is this anguishfixed and deep
 Vainer desires and dreams of bliss

 My love awakes no love again
 My tears collect and fall unfelt
 My sorrow touches none with pain
 My humble hopes to nothing melt

 For me the universe is dumb
 Stonedeaf and blank and wholly blind
 Life I must bound existence sum
 In the strait limits of one mind

 That mind my own Oh narrow cell
 Darkimagelessa living tomb
 There must I sleep there wake and dwell
 Content with palsy pain and gloom

 Again she paused a moan of pain
 A stifled sob alone was heard
 Long silence followedthen again
 Her voice the stagnant midnight stirred

 Must it be so Is this my fate
 Can I nor struggle nor contend
 And am I doomed for years to wait
 Watching deaths lingering axe descend

 And when it falls and when I die
 What follows Vacant nothingness
 The blank of lost identity
 Erasure both of pain and bliss

 Ive heard of heavenI would believe
 For if this earth indeed be all
 Who longest lives may deepest grieve
 Most blest whom sorrows soonest call

 Oh leaving disappointment here
 Will man find hope on yonder coast
 Hope which on earth shines never clear
 And oft in clouds is wholly lost

 Will he hopes source of light behold
 Fruitions spring where doubts expire
 And drink in waves of living gold
 Contentment full for long desire

 Will he find bliss which here he dreamed
 Rest which was weariness on earth
 Knowledge which if oer life it beamed
 Served but to prove it void of worth

 Will he find love without lusts leaven
 Love fearless tearless perfect pure
 To all with equal bounty given
 In all unfeigned unfailing sure

 Will he from penal sufferings free
 Released from shroud and wormy clod
 All calm and glorious rise and see
 Creations SireExistence God

 Then glancing back on Times brief woes
 Will he behold them fading fly
 Swept from Eternitys repose
 Like sullying cloud from pure blue sky

 If so endure my weary frame
 And when thy anguish strikes too deep
 And when all troubled burns lifes flame
 Think of the quiet final sleep

 Think of the glorious wakinghour
 Which will not dawn on grief and tears
 But on a ransomed spirits power
 Certain and free from mortal fears

 Seek now thy couch and lie till morn
 Then from thy chamber calm descend
 With mind nor tossed nor anguishtorn
 But tranquil fixed to wait the end

 And when thy opening eyes shall see
 Mementos on the chamber wall
 Of one who has forgotten thee
 Shed not the tear of acrid gall

 The tear which welling from the heart
 Burns where its drop corrosive falls
 And makes each nerve in torture start
 At feelings it too well recalls

 When the sweet hope of being loved
 Threw Eden sunshine on lifes way
 When every sense and feeling proved
 Expectancy of brightest day

 When the hand trembled to receive
 A thrilling clasp which seemed so near
 And the heart ventured to believe
 Another heart esteemed it dear

 When words half love all tenderness
 Were hourly heard as hourly spoken
 When the long sunny days of bliss
 Only by moonlight nights were broken

 Till drop by drop the cup of joy
 Filled full with purple light was glowing
 And Faith which watched it sparkling high
 Still never dreamt the overflowing

 It fell not with a sudden crashing
 It poured not out like open sluice
 No sparkling still and redly flashing
 Drained drop by drop the generous juice

 I saw it sink and strove to taste it
 My eager lips approached the brim
 The movement only seemed to waste it
 It sank to dregs all harsh and dim

 These I have drunk and they for ever
 Have poisoned life and love for me
 A draught from Sodoms lake could never
 More fiery salt and bitter be

 Oh Love was all a thin illusion
 Joy but the deserts flying stream
 And glancing back on long delusion
 My memory grasps a hollow dream

 Yet whence that wondrous change of feeling
 I never knew and cannot learn
 Nor why my lovers eye congealing
 Grew cold and clouded proud and stern

 Nor wherefore friendships forms forgetting
 He careless left and cool withdrew
 Nor spoke of grief nor fond regretting
 Nor evn one glance of comfort threw

 And neither word nor token sending
 Of kindness since the parting day
 His course for distant regions bending
 Went selfcontained and calm away

 Oh bitter blighting keen sensation
 Which will not weaken cannot die
 Hasten thy work of desolation
 And let my tortured spirit fly

 Vain as the passing gale my crying
 Though lightningstruck I must live on
 I know at heart there is no dying
 Of love and ruined hope alone

 Still strong and young and warm with vigour
 Though scathed I long shall greenly grow
 And many a storm of wildest rigour
 Shall yet break oer my shivered bough

 Rebellious now to blank inertion
 My unused strength demands a task
 Travel and toil and full exertion
 Are the last only boon I ask

 Whence then this vain and barren dreaming
 Of death and dubious life to come
 I see a nearer beacon gleaming
 Over dejections sea of gloom

 The very wildness of my sorrow
 Tells me I yet have innate force
 My track of life has been too narrow
 Effort shall trace a broader course

 The world is not in yonder tower
 Earth is not prisoned in that room
 Mid whose dark panels hour by hour
 Ive sat the slave and prey of gloom

 One feelingturned to utter anguish
 Is not my beings only aim
 When lorn and loveless life will languish
 But courage can revive the flame

 He when he left me went a roving
 To sunny climes beyond the sea
 And I the weight of woe removing
 Am free and fetterless as he

 New scenes new language skies less clouded
 May once more wake the wish to live
 Strange foreign towns astir and crowded
 New pictures to the mind may give

 New forms and faces passing ever
 May hide the one I still retain
 Defined and fixed and fading never
 Stamped deep on vision heart and brain

 And we might meettime may have changed him
 Chance may reveal the mystery
 The secret influence which estranged him
 Love may restore him yet to me

 False thoughtfalse hopein scorn be banished
 I am not lovednor loved have been
 Recall not then the dreams scarce vanished
 Traitors mislead me not again

 To words like yours I bid defiance
 Tis such my mental wreck have made
 Of God alone and selfreliance
 I ask for solacehope for aid

 Morn comesand ere meridian glory
 Oer these my natal woods shall smile
 Both lonely wood and mansion hoary
 Ill leave behind full many a mile




GILBERT

 I THE GARDEN

 Above the city hung the moon
 Right oer a plot of ground
 Where flowers and orchardtrees were fenced
 With lofty walls around
 Twas Gilberts gardenthere tonight
 Awhile he walked alone
 And tired with sedentary toil
 Mused where the moonlight shone

 This garden in a cityheart
 Lay still as houseless wild
 Though manywindowed mansion fronts
 Were round it closely piled
 But thick their walls and those within
 Lived lives by noise unstirred
 Like wafting of an angels wing
 Times flight by them was heard

 Some soft pianonotes alone
 Were sweet as faintly given
 Where ladies doubtless cheered the hearth
 With song that wintereven
 The citys manymingled sounds
 Rose like the hum of ocean
 They rather lulled the heart than roused
 Its pulse to faster motion

 Gilbert has paced the single walk
 An hour yet is not weary
 And though it be a winter night
 He feels nor cold nor dreary
 The prime of life is in his veins
 And sends his blood fast flowing
 And Fancys fervour warms the thoughts
 Now in his bosom glowing

 Those thoughts recur to early love
 Or what he love would name
 Though haply Gilberts secret deeds
 Might other title claim
 Such theme not oft his mind absorbs
 He to the world clings fast
 And too much for the present lives
 To linger oer the past

 But now the evenings deep repose
 Has glided to his soul
 That moonlight falls on Memory
 And shows her fading scroll
 One name appears in every line
 The gentle rays shine oer
 And still he smiles and still repeats
 That one nameElinor

 There is no sorrow in his smile
 No kindness in his tone
 The triumph of a selfish heart
 Speaks coldly there alone
 He says She loved me more than life
 And truly it was sweet
 To see so fair a woman kneel
 In bondage at my feet

 There was a sort of quiet bliss
 To be so deeply loved
 To gaze on trembling eagerness
 And sit myself unmoved
 And when it pleased my pride to grant
 At last some rare caress
 To feel the fever of that hand
 My fingers deigned to press

 Twas sweet to see her strive to hide
 What every glance revealed
 Endowed the while with despotmight
 Her destiny to wield
 I knew myself no perfect man
 Nor as she deemed divine
 I knew that I was gloriousbut
 By her reflected shine

 Her youth her native energy
 Her powers newborn and fresh
 Twas these with Godhead sanctified
 My sensual frame of flesh
 Yet like a god did I descend
 At last to meet her love
 And like a god I then withdrew
 To my own heaven above

 And never more could she invoke
 My presence to her sphere
 No prayer no plaint no cry of hers
 Could win my awful ear
 I knew her blinded constancy
 Would neer my deeds betray
 And calm in conscience whole in heart
 I went my tranquil way

 Yet sometimes I still feel a wish
 The fond and flattering pain
 Of passions anguish to create
 In her young breast again
 Bright was the lustre of her eyes
 When they caught fire from mine
 If I had powerthis very hour
 Again Id light their shine

 But where she is or how she lives
 I have no clue to know
 Ive heard she long my absence pined
 And left her home in woe
 But busied then in gathering gold
 As I am busied now
 I could not turn from such pursuit
 To weep a broken vow

 Nor could I give to fatal risk
 The fame I ever prized
 Even now I fear that precious fame
 Is too much compromised
 An inward trouble dims his eye
 Some riddle he would solve
 Some method to unloose a knot
 His anxious thoughts revolve

 He pensive leans against a tree
 A leafy evergreen
 The boughs the moonlight intercept
 And hide him like a screen
 He startsthe tree shakes with his tremor
 Yet nothing near him passd
 He hurries up the garden alley
 In strangely sudden haste

 With shaking hand he lifts the latchet
 Steps oer the threshold stone
 The heavy door slips from his fingers
 It shuts and he is gone
 What touched transfixed appalled his soul
 A nervous thought no more
 Twill sink like stone in placid pool
 And calm close smoothly oer


 II THE PARLOUR

 Warm is the parlour atmosphere
 Serene the lamps soft light
 The vivid embers red and clear
 Proclaim a frosty night
 Books varied on the table lie
 Three children oer them bend
 And all with curious eager eye
 The turning leaf attend

 Picture and tale alternately
 Their simple hearts delight
 And interest deep and tempered glee
 Illume their aspects bright
 The parents from their fireside place
 Behold that pleasant scene
 And joy is on the mothers face
 Pride in the fathers mien

 As Gilbert sees his blooming wife
 Beholds his children fair
 No thought has he of transient strife
 Or past though piercing fear
 The voice of happy infancy
 Lisps sweetly in his ear
 His wife with pleased and peaceful eye
 Sits kindly smiling near

 The fire glows on her silken dress
 And shows its ample grace
 And warmly tints each hazel tress
 Curled soft around her face
 The beauty that in youth he wooed
 Is beauty still unfaded
 The brow of ever placid mood
 No churlish grief has shaded

 Prosperity in Gilberts home
 Abides the guest of years
 There Want or Discord never come
 And seldom Toil or Tears
 The carpets bear the peaceful print
 Of comforts velvet tread
 And golden gleams from plenty sent
 In every nook are shed

 The very silken spaniel seems
 Of quiet ease to tell
 As near its mistress feet it dreams
 Sunk in a cushions swell
 And smiles seem native to the eyes
 Of those sweet children three
 They have but looked on tranquil skies
 And know not misery

 Alas that Misery should come
 In such an hour as this
 Why could she not so calm a home
 A little longer miss
 But she is now within the door
 Her steps advancing glide
 Her sullen shade has crossed the floor
 She stands at Gilberts side

 She lays her hand upon his heart
 It bounds with agony
 His fireside chair shakes with the start
 That shook the garden tree
 His wife towards the children looks
 She does not mark his mien
 The children bending oer their books
 His terror have not seen

 In his own home by his own hearth
 He sits in solitude
 And circled round with light and mirth
 Cold horror chills his blood
 His mind would hold with desperate clutch
 The scene that round him lies
 Nochanged as by some wizards touch
 The present prospect flies

 A tumult vaguea viewless strife
 His futile struggles crush
 Twixt him and his an unknown life
 And unknown feelings rush
 He seesbut scarce can language paint
 The tissue fancy weaves
 For words oft give but echo faint
 Of thoughts the mind conceives

 Noise tumult strange and darkness dim
 Efface both light and quiet
 No shape is in those shadows grim
 No voice in that wild riot
 Sustaind and strong a wondrous blast
 Above and round him blows
 A greenish gloom dense overcast
 Each moment denser grows

 He nothing knowsnor clearly sees
 Resistance checks his breath
 The high impetuous ceaseless breeze
 Blows on him cold as death
 And still the undulating gloom
 Mocks sight with formless motion
 Was such sensation Jonahs doom
 Gulphed in the depths of ocean

 Streaking the air the nameless vision
 Fastdriven deepsounding flows
 Oh whence its source and what its mission
 How will its terrors close
 Longsweeping rushing vast and void
 The universe it swallows
 And still the dark devouring tide
 A typhoon tempest follows

 More slow it rolls its furious race
 Sinks to its solemn gliding
 The stunning roar the winds wild chase
 To stillness are subsiding
 And slowly borne along a form
 The shapeless chaos varies
 Poised in the eddy to the storm
 Before the eye it tarries

 A woman drownedsunk in the deep
 On a long wave reclining
 The circling waters crystal sweep
 Like glass her shape enshrining
 Her pale dead face to Gilbert turned
 Seems as in sleep reposing
 A feeble light now first discerned
 The features well disclosing

 No effort from the haunted air
 The ghastly scene could banish
 That hovering wave arrested there
 Rolledthrobbedbut did not vanish
 If Gilbert upward turned his gaze
 He saw the oceanshadow
 If he looked down the endless seas
 Lay green as summer meadow

 And straight before the pale corpse lay
 Upborne by air or billow
 So near he could have touched the spray
 That churned around its pillow
 The hollow anguish of the face
 Had moved a fiend to sorrow
 Not deaths fixed calm could rase the trace
 Of sufferings deepworn furrow

 All moved a strong returning blast
 The mass of waters raising
 Bore wave and passive carcase past
 While Gilbert yet was gazing
 Deep in her isleconceiving womb
 It seemed the ocean thundered
 And soon by realms of rushing gloom
 Were seer and phantom sundered

 Then swept some timbers from a wreck
 On following surges riding
 Then seaweed in the turbid rack
 Uptorn went slowly gliding
 The horrid shade by slow degrees
 A beam of light defeated
 And then the roar of raving seas
 Fast far and faint retreated

 And all was gonegone like a mist
 Corse billows tempest wreck
 Three children close to Gilbert prest
 And clung around his neck
 Good night good night the prattlers said
 And kissed their fathers cheek
 Twas now the hour their quiet bed
 And placid rest to seek

 The mother with her offspring goes
 To hear their evening prayer
 She nought of Gilberts vision knows
 And nought of his despair
 Yet pitying God abridge the time
 Of anguish now his fate
 Though haply great has been his crime
 Thy mercy too is great

 Gilbert at length uplifts his head
 Bent for some moments low
 And there is neither grief nor dread
 Upon his subtle brow
 For well can he his feelings task
 And well his looks command
 His features well his heart can mask
 With smiles and smoothness bland

 Gilbert has reasoned with his mind
 He says twas all a dream
 He strives his inward sight to blind
 Against truths inward beam
 He pitied not that shadowy thing
 When it was flesh and blood
 Nor now can pitys balmy spring
 Refresh his arid mood

 And if that dream has spoken truth
 Thus musingly he says
 If Elinor be dead in sooth
 Such chance the shock repays
 A net was woven round my feet
 I scarce could further go
 Ere shame had forced a fast retreat
 Dishonour brought me low

 Conceal her then deep silent sea
 Give her a secret grave
 She sleeps in peace and I am free
 No longer terrors slave
 And homage still from all the world
 Shall greet my spotless name
 Since surges break and waves are curled
 Above its threatened shame


 III THE WELCOME HOME

 Above the city hangs the moon
 Some clouds are boding rain
 Gilbert erewhile on journey gone
 Tonight comes home again
 Ten years have passed above his head
 Each year has brought him gain
 His prosperous life has smoothly sped
 Without or tear or stain

 Tis somewhat latethe city clocks
 Twelve deep vibrations toll
 As Gilbert at the portal knocks
 Which is his journeys goal
 The street is still and desolate
 The moon hid by a cloud
 Gilbert impatient will not wait
 His second knock peals loud

 The clocks are hushedtheres not a light
 In any window nigh
 And not a single planet bright
 Looks from the clouded sky
 The air is raw the rain descends
 A bitter northwind blows
 His cloak the traveller scarce defends
 Will not the door unclose

 He knocks the third time and the last
 His summons now they hear
 Within a footstep hurrying fast
 Is heard approaching near
 The bolt is drawn the clanking chain
 Falls to the floor of stone
 And Gilbert to his heart will strain
 His wife and children soon

 The hand that lifts the latchet holds
 A candle to his sight
 And Gilbert on the step beholds
 A woman clad in white
 Lo water from her dripping dress
 Runs on the streaming floor
 From every dark and clinging tress
 The drops incessant pour

 Theres none but her to welcome him
 She holds the candle high
 And motionless in form and limb
 Stands cold and silent nigh
 Theres sand and seaweed on her robe
 Her hollow eyes are blind
 No pulse in such a frame can throb
 No life is there defined

 Gilbert turned ashywhite but still
 His lips vouchsafed no cry
 He spurred his strength and masterwill
 To pass the figure by
 But moving slow it faced him straight
 It would not flinch nor quail
 Then first did Gilberts strength abate
 His stony firmness quail

 He sank upon his knees and prayed
 The shape stood rigid there
 He called aloud for human aid
 No human aid was near
 An accent strange did thus repeat
 Heavens stern but just decree
 The measure thou to her didst mete
 To thee shall measured be

 Gilbert sprang from his bended knees
 By the pale spectre pushed
 And wild as one whom demons seize
 Up the hallstaircase rushed
 Entered his chambernear the bed
 Sheathed steel and firearms hung
 Impelled by maniac purpose dread
 He chose those stores among

 Across his throat a keenedged knife
 With vigorous hand he drew
 The wound was widehis outraged life
 Rushed rash and redly through
 And thus died by a shameful death
 A wise and worldly man
 Who never drew but selfish breath
 Since first his life began




LIFE

 Life believe is not a dream
 So dark as sages say
 Oft a little morning rain
 Foretells a pleasant day
 Sometimes there are clouds of gloom
 But these are transient all
 If the shower will make the roses bloom
 O why lament its fall
 Rapidly merrily
 Lifes sunny hours flit by
 Gratefully cheerily
 Enjoy them as they fly
 What though Death at times steps in
 And calls our Best away
 What though sorrow seems to win
 Oer hope a heavy sway
 Yet Hope again elastic springs
 Unconquered though she fell
 Still buoyant are her golden wings
 Still strong to bear us well
 Manfully fearlessly
 The day of trial bear
 For gloriously victoriously
 Can courage quell despair




THE LETTER

 What is she writing Watch her now
 How fast her fingers move
 How eagerly her youthful brow
 Is bent in thought above
 Her long curls drooping shade the light
 She puts them quick aside
 Nor knows that band of crystals bright
 Her hasty touch untied
 It slips adown her silken dress
 Falls glittering at her feet
 Unmarked it falls for she no less
 Pursues her labour sweet

 The very loveliest hour that shines
 Is in that deep blue sky
 The golden sun of June declines
 It has not caught her eye
 The cheerful lawn and unclosed gate
 The white road far away
 In vain for her light footsteps wait
 She comes not forth today
 There is an open door of glass
 Close by that ladys chair
 From thence to slopes of messy grass
 Descends a marble stair

 Tall plants of bright and spicy bloom
 Around the threshold grow
 Their leaves and blossoms shade the room
 From that suns deepening glow
 Why does she not a moment glance
 Between the clustering flowers
 And mark in heaven the radiant dance
 Of evenings rosy hours
 O look again Still fixed her eye
 Unsmiling earnest still
 And fast her pen and fingers fly
 Urged by her eager will

 Her soul is in thabsorbing task
 To whom then doth she write
 Nay watch her still more closely ask
 Her own eyes serious light
 Where do they turn as now her pen
 Hangs oer thunfinished line
 Whence fell the tearful gleam that then
 Did in their dark spheres shine
 The summerparlour looks so dark
 When from that sky you turn
 And from thexpanse of that green park
 You scarce may aught discern

 Yet oer the piles of porcelain rare
 Oer flowerstand couch and vase
 Sloped as if leaning on the air
 One picture meets the gaze
 Tis there she turns you may not see
 Distinct what form defines
 The clouded mass of mystery
 Yon broad gold frame confines
 But look again inured to shade
 Your eyes now faintly trace
 A stalwart form a massive head
 A firm determined face

 Black Spanish locks a sunburnt cheek
 A brow high broad and white
 Where every furrow seems to speak
 Of mind and moral might
 Is that her god I cannot tell
 Her eye a moment met
 Thimpending picture then it fell
 Darkened and dimmed and wet
 A moment more her task is done
 And sealed the letter lies
 And now towards the setting sun
 She turns her tearful eyes

 Those tears flow over wonder not
 For by the inscription see
 In what a strange and distant spot
 Her heart of hearts must be
 Three seas and many a league of land
 That letter must pass oer
 Ere read by him to whose loved hand
 Tis sent from Englands shore
 Remote colonial wilds detain
 Her husband loved though stern
 She mid that smiling English scene
 Weeps for his wished return




REGRET

 Long ago I wished to leave
 The house where I was born
 Long ago I used to grieve
 My home seemed so forlorn
 In other years its silent rooms
 Were filled with haunting fears
 Now their very memory comes
 Oercharged with tender tears

 Life and marriage I have known
 Things once deemed so bright
 Now how utterly is flown
 Every ray of light
 Mid the unknown sea of life
 I no blest isle have found
 At last through all its wild waves strife
 My bark is homeward bound

 Farewell dark and rolling deep
 Farewell foreign shore
 Open in unclouded sweep
 Thou glorious realm before
 Yet though I had safely passd
 That weary vexed main
 One loved voice through surge and blast
 Could call me back again

 Though the souls bright morning rose
 Oer Paradise for me
 William even from Heavens repose
 Id turn invoked by thee
 Storm nor surge should eer arrest
 My soul exalting then
 All my heaven was once thy breast
 Would it were mine again




PRESENTIMENT

 Sister youve sat there all the day
 Come to the hearth awhile
 The wind so wildly sweeps away
 The clouds so darkly pile
 That open book has lain unread
 For hours upon your knee
 Youve never smiled nor turned your head
 What can you sister see

 Come hither Jane look down the field
 How dense a mist creeps on
 The path the hedge are both concealed
 Evn the white gate is gone
 No landscape through the fog I trace
 No hill with pastures green
 All featureless is Natures face
 All masked in clouds her mien

 Scarce is the rustle of a leaf
 Heard in our garden now
 The year grows old its days wax brief
 The tresses leave its brow
 The rain drives fast before the wind
 The sky is blank and grey
 O Jane what sadness fills the mind
 On such a dreary day

 You think too much my sister dear
 You sit too long alone
 What though November days be drear
 Full soon will they be gone
 Ive swept the hearth and placed your chair
 Come Emma sit by me
 Our own fireside is never drear
 Though late and wintry wane the year
 Though rough the night may be

 The peaceful glow of our fireside
 Imparts no peace to me
 My thoughts would rather wander wide
 Than rest dear Jane with thee
 Im on a distant journey bound
 And if about my heart
 Too closely kindred ties were bound
 Twould break when forced to part

 Soon will November days be oer
 Well have you spoken Jane
 My own forebodings tell me more
 For me I know by presage sure
 Theyll neer return again
 Ere long nor sun nor storm to me
 Will bring or joy or gloom
 They reach not that Eternity
 Which soon will be my home

 Eight months are gone the summer sun
 Sets in a glorious sky
 A quiet field all green and lone
 Receives its rosy dye
 Jane sits upon a shaded stile
 Alone she sits there now
 Her head rests on her hand the while
 And thought oercasts her brow

 Shes thinking of one winters day
 A few short months ago
 Then Emmas bier was borne away
 Oer wastes of frozen snow
 Shes thinking how that drifted snow
 Dissolved in springs first gleam
 And how her sisters memory now
 Fades even as fades a dream

 The snow will whiten earth again
 But Emma comes no more
 She left mid winters sleet and rain
 This world for Heavens far shore
 On Beulahs hills she wanders now
 On Edens tranquil plain
 To her shall Jane hereafter go
 She neer shall come to Jane




THE TEACHERS MONOLOGUE

 The room is quiet thoughts alone
 People its mute tranquillity
 The yoke put off the long task done
 I am as it is bliss to be
 Still and untroubled Now I see
 For the first time how soft the day
 Oer waveless water stirless tree
 Silent and sunny wings its way
 Now as I watch that distant hill
 So faint so blue so far removed
 Sweet dreams of home my heart may fill
 That home where I am known and loved
 It lies beyond yon azure brow
 Parts me from all Earth holds for me
 And morn and eve my yearnings flow
 Thitherward tending changelessly
 My happiest hours aye all the time
 I love to keep in memory
 Lapsed among moors ere lifes first prime
 Decayed to dark anxiety

 Sometimes I think a narrow heart
 Makes me thus mourn those far away
 And keeps my love so far apart
 From friends and friendships of today
 Sometimes I think tis but a dream
 I treasure up so jealously
 All the sweet thoughts I live on seem
 To vanish into vacancy
 And then this strange coarse world around
 Seems all thats palpable and true
 And every sight and every sound
 Combines my spirit to subdue
 To aching grief so void and lone
 Is Life and Earthso worse than vain
 The hopes that in my own heart sown
 And cherished by such sun and rain
 As Joy and transient Sorrow shed
 Have ripened to a harvest there
 Alas methinks I hear it said
 Thy golden sheaves are empty air

 All fades away my very home
 I think will soon be desolate
 I hear at times a warning come
 Of bitter partings at its gate
 And if I should return and see
 The hearthfire quenched the vacant chair
 And hear it whispered mournfully
 That farewells have been spoken there
 What shall I do and whither turn
 Where look for peace When cease to mourn


 Tis not the air I wished to play
 The strain I wished to sing
 My wilful spirit slipped away
 And struck another string
 I neither wanted smile nor tear
 Bright joy nor bitter woe
 But just a song that sweet and clear
 Though haply sad might flow

 A quiet song to solace me
 When sleep refused to come
 A strain to chase despondency
 When sorrowful for home
 In vain I try I cannot sing
 All feels so cold and dead
 No wild distress no gushing spring
 Of tears in anguish shed

 But all the impatient gloom of one
 Who waits a distant day
 When some great task of suffering done
 Repose shall toil repay
 For youth departs and pleasure flies
 And life consumes away
 And youths rejoicing ardour dies
 Beneath this drear delay

 And Patience weary with her yoke
 Is yielding to despair
 And Healths elastic spring is broke
 Beneath the strain of care
 Life will be gone ere I have lived
 Where now is Lifes first prime
 Ive worked and studied longed and grieved
 Through all that rosy time

 To toil to think to long to grieve
 Is such my future fate
 The morn was dreary must the eve
 Be also desolate
 Well such a life at least makes Death
 A welcome wishedfor friend
 Then aid me Reason Patience Faith
 To suffer to the end




PASSION

 Some have won a wild delight
 By daring wilder sorrow
 Could I gain thy love tonight
 Id hazard death tomorrow

 Could the battlestruggle earn
 One kind glance from thine eye
 How this withering heart would burn
 The heady fight to try

 Welcome nights of broken sleep
 And days of carnage cold
 Could I deem that thou wouldst weep
 To hear my perils told

 Tell me if with wandering bands
 I roam full far away
 Wilt thou to those distant lands
 In spirit ever stray

 Wild long a trumpet sounds afar
 Bid mebid me go
 Where Seik and Briton meet in war
 On Indian Sutlejs flow

 Blood has dyed the Sutlejs waves
 With scarlet stain I know
 Indus borders yawn with graves
 Yet command me go

 Though rank and high the holocaust
 Of nations steams to heaven
 Glad Id join the deathdoomed host
 Were but the mandate given

 Passions strength should nerve my arm
 Its ardour stir my life
 Till human force to that dread charm
 Should yield and sink in wild alarm
 Like trees to tempeststrife

 If hot from war I seek thy love
 Darest thou turn aside
 Darest thou then my fire reprove
 By scorn and maddening pride

 Nomy will shall yet control
 Thy will so high and free
 And love shall tame that haughty soul
 Yestenderest love for me

 Ill read my triumph in thine eyes
 Behold and prove the change
 Then leave perchance my noble prize
 Once more in arms to range

 Id die when all the foam is up
 The bright wine sparkling high
 Nor wait till in the exhausted cup
 Lifes dull dregs only lie

 Then Love thus crowned with sweet reward
 Hope blest with fulness large
 Id mount the saddle draw the sword
 And perish in the charge




PREFERENCE

 Not in scorn do I reprove thee
 Not in pride thy vows I waive
 But believe I could not love thee
 Wert thou prince and I a slave
 These then are thine oaths of passion
 This thy tenderness for me
 Judged even by thine own confession
 Thou art steeped in perfidy
 Having vanquished thou wouldst leave me
 Thus I read thee long ago
 Therefore dared I not deceive thee
 Even with friendships gentle show
 Therefore with impassive coldness
 Have I ever met thy gaze
 Though full oft with daring boldness
 Thou thine eyes to mine didst raise
 Why that smile Thou now art deeming
 This my coldness all untrue
 But a mask of frozen seeming
 Hiding secret fires from view
 Touch my hand thou selfdeceiver
 Naybe calm for I am so
 Does it burn Does my lip quiver
 Has mine eye a troubled glow
 Canst thou call a moments colour
 To my foreheadto my cheek
 Canst thou tinge their tranquil pallor
 With one flattering feverish streak
 Am I marble What no woman
 Could so calm before thee stand
 Nothing living sentient human
 Could so coldly take thy hand
 Yesa sister might a mother
 My goodwill is sisterly
 Dream not then I strive to smother
 Fires that inly burn for thee
 Rave not rage not wrath is fruitless
 Fury cannot change my mind
 I but deem the feeling rootless
 Which so whirls in passions wind
 Can I love Oh deeplytruly
 Warmlyfondlybut not thee
 And my love is answered duly
 With an equal energy
 Wouldst thou see thy rival Hasten
 Draw that curtain soft aside
 Look where yon thick branches chasten
 Noon with shades of eventide
 In that glade where foliage blending
 Forms a green arch overhead
 Sits thy rival thoughtful bending
 Oer a stand with papers spread
 Motionless his fingers plying
 That untired unresting pen
 Time and tide unnoticed flying
 There he sitsthe first of men
 Man of conscienceman of reason
 Stern perchance but ever just
 Foe to falsehood wrong and treason
 Honours shield and virtues trust
 Worker thinker firm defender
 Of Heavens truthmans liberty
 Soul of ironproof to slander
 Rock where founders tyranny
 Fame he seeks notbut full surely
 She will seek him in his home
 This I know and wait securely
 For the atoning hour to come
 To that man my faith is given
 Therefore soldier cease to sue
 While God reigns in earth and heaven
 I to him will still be true




EVENING SOLACE

 The human heart has hidden treasures
 In secret kept in silence sealed
 The thoughts the hopes the dreams the pleasures
 Whose charms were broken if revealed
 And days may pass in gay confusion
 And nights in rosy riot fly
 While lost in Fames or Wealths illusion
 The memory of the Past may die

 But there are hours of lonely musing
 Such as in evening silence come
 When soft as birds their pinions closing
 The hearts best feelings gather home
 Then in our souls there seems to languish
 A tender grief that is not woe
 And thoughts that once wrung groans of anguish
 Now cause but some mild tears to flow

 And feelings once as strong as passions
 Float softly backa faded dream
 Our own sharp griefs and wild sensations
 The tale of others sufferings seem
 Oh when the heart is freshly bleeding
 How longs it for that time to be
 When through the mist of years receding
 Its woes but live in reverie

 And it can dwell on moonlight glimmer
 On evening shade and loneliness
 And while the sky grows dim and dimmer
 Feel no untold and strange distress
 Only a deeper impulse given
 By lonely hour and darkened room
 To solemn thoughts that soar to heaven
 Seeking a life and world to come




STANZAS

 If thou be in a lonely place
 If one hours calm be thine
 As Evening bends her placid face
 Oer this sweet days decline
 If all the earth and all the heaven
 Now look serene to thee
 As oer them shuts the summer even
 One momentthink of me

 Pause in the lane returning home
 Tis dusk it will be still
 Pause near the elm a sacred gloom
 Its breezeless boughs will fill
 Look at that soft and golden light
 High in the unclouded sky
 Watch the last birds belated flight
 As it flits silent by

 Hark for a sound upon the wind
 A step a voice a sigh
 If all be still then yield thy mind
 Unchecked to memory
 If thy love were like mine how blest
 That twilight hour would seem
 When back from the regretted Past
 Returned our early dream

 If thy love were like mine how wild
 Thy longings even to pain
 For sunset soft and moonlight mild
 To bring that hour again
 But oft when in thine arms I lay
 Ive seen thy dark eyes shine
 And deeply felt their changeful ray
 Spoke other love than mine

 My love is almost anguish now
 It beats so strong and true
 Twere rapture could I deem that thou
 Such anguish ever knew
 I have been but thy transient flower
 Thou wert my god divine
 Till checked by deaths congealing power
 This heart must throb for thine

 And well my dying hour were blest
 If lifes expiring breath
 Should pass as thy lips gently prest
 My forehead cold in death
 And sound my sleep would be and sweet
 Beneath the churchyard tree
 If sometimes in thy heart should beat
 One pulse still true to me




PARTING

 Theres no use in weeping
 Though we are condemned to part
 Theres such a thing as keeping
 A remembrance in ones heart

 Theres such a thing as dwelling
 On the thought ourselves have nursed
 And with scorn and courage telling
 The world to do its worst

 Well not let its follies grieve us
 Well just take them as they come
 And then every day will leave us
 A merry laugh for home

 When weve left each friend and brother
 When were parted wide and far
 We will think of one another
 As even better than we are

 Every glorious sight above us
 Every pleasant sight beneath
 Well connect with those that love us
 Whom we truly love till death

 In the evening when were sitting
 By the fire perchance alone
 Then shall heart with warm heart meeting
 Give responsive tone for tone

 We can burst the bonds which chain us
 Which cold human hands have wrought
 And where none shall dare restrain us
 We can meet again in thought

 So theres no use in weeping
 Bear a cheerful spirit still
 Never doubt that Fate is keeping
 Future good for present ill




APOSTASY

 This last denial of my faith
 Thou solemn Priest hast heard
 And though upon my bed of death
 I call not back a word
 Point not to thy Madonna Priest
 Thy sightless saint of stone
 She cannot from this burning breast
 Wring one repentant moan

 Thou sayst that when a sinless child
 I duly bent the knee
 And prayed to what in marble smiled
 Cold lifeless mute on me
 I did But listen Children spring
 Full soon to riper youth
 And for Loves vow and Wedlocks ring
 I sold my early truth

 Twas not a grey bare head like thine
 Bent oer me when I said
 That land and God and Faith are mine
 For which thy fathers bled
 I see thee not my eyes are dim
 But well I hear thee say
 O daughter cease to think of him
 Who led thy soul astray

 Between you lies both space and time
 Let leagues and years prevail
 To turn thee from the path of crime
 Back to the Churchs pale
 And did I need that thou shouldst tell
 What mighty barriers rise
 To part me from that dungeoncell
 Where my loved Walter lies

 And did I need that thou shouldst taunt
 My dying hour at last
 By bidding this worn spirit pant
 No more for what is past
 PriestMUST I cease to think of him
 How hollow rings that word
 Can time can tears can distance dim
 The memory of my lord

 I said before I saw not thee
 Because an hour agone
 Over my eyeballs heavily
 The lids fell down like stone
 But still my spirits inward sight
 Beholds his image beam
 As fixed as clear as burning bright
 As some red planets gleam

 Talk not of thy Last Sacrament
 Tell not thy beads for me
 Both rite and prayer are vainly spent
 As dews upon the sea
 Speak not one word of Heaven above
 Rave not of Hells alarms
 Give me but back my Walters love
 Restore me to his arms

 Then will the bliss of Heaven be won
 Then will Hell shrink away
 As I have seen nights terrors shun
 The conquering steps of day
 Tis my religion thus to love
 My creed thus fixed to be
 Not Death shall shake nor Priestcraft break
 My rocklike constancy

 Now go for at the door there waits
 Another stranger guest
 He callsI comemy pulse scarce beats
 My heart fails in my breast
 Again that voicehow far away
 How dreary sounds that tone
 And I methinks am gone astray
 In trackless wastes and lone

 I fain would rest a little while
 Where can I find a stay
 Till dawn upon the hills shall smile
 And show some trodden way
 I come I come in haste she said
 Twas Walters voice I heard
 Then up she sprangbut fell back dead
 His name her latest word




WINTER STORES

 We take from life one little share
 And say that this shall be
 A space redeemed from toil and care
 From tears and sadness free

 And haply Death unstrings his bow
 And Sorrow stands apart
 And for a little while we know
 The sunshine of the heart

 Existence seems a summer eve
 Warm soft and full of peace
 Our free unfettered feelings give
 The soul its full release

 A moment then it takes the power
 To call up thoughts that throw
 Around that charmed and hallowed hour
 This lifes divinest glow

 But Time though viewlessly it flies
 And slowly will not stay
 Alike through clear and clouded skies
 It cleaves its silent way

 Alike the bitter cup of grief
 Alike the draught of bliss
 Its progress leaves but moment brief
 For baffled lips to kiss

 The sparkling draught is dried away
 The hour of rest is gone
 And urgent voices round us say
 Ho lingerer hasten on

 And has the soul then only gained
 From this brief time of ease
 A moments rest when overstrained
 One hurried glimpse of peace

 No while the sun shone kindly oer us
 And flowers bloomed round our feet
 While many a bud of joy before us
 Unclosed its petals sweet

 An unseen work within was plying
 Like honeyseeking bee
 From flower to flower unwearied flying
 Laboured one faculty

 Thoughtful for Winters future sorrow
 Its gloom and scarcity
 Prescient today of want tomorrow
 Toiled quiet Memory

 Tis she that from each transient pleasure
 Extracts a lasting good
 Tis she that finds in summer treasure
 To serve for winters food

 And when Youths summer day is vanished
 And Age brings Winters stress
 Her stores with hoarded sweets replenished
 Lifes evening hours will bless




THE MISSIONARY

 Plough vessel plough the British main
 Seek the free oceans wider plain
 Leave English scenes and English skies
 Unbind dissever English ties
 Bear me to climes remote and strange
 Where altered life fastfollowing change
 Hot action neverceasing toil
 Shall stir turn dig the spirits soil
 Fresh roots shall plant fresh seed shall sow
 Till a new garden there shall grow
 Cleared of the weeds that fill it now
 Mere human love mere selfish yearning
 Which cherished would arrest me yet
 I grasp the plough theres no returning
 Let me then struggle to forget

 But Englands shores are yet in view
 And Englands skies of tender blue
 Are arched above her guardian sea
 I cannot yet Remembrance flee
 I must again then firmly face
 That task of anguish to retrace
 Wedded to homeI home forsake
 Fearful of changeI changes make
 Too fond of easeI plunge in toil
 Lover of calmI seek turmoil
 Nature and hostile Destiny
 Stir in my heart a conflict wild
 And long and fierce the war will be
 Ere duty both has reconciled

 What other tie yet holds me fast
 To the divorced abandoned past
 Smouldering on my hearts altar lies
 The fire of some great sacrifice
 Not yet half quenched The sacred steel
 But lately struck my carnal will
 My lifelong hope first joy and last
 What I loved well and clung to fast
 What I wished wildly to retain
 What I renounced with soulfelt pain
 Whatwhen I saw it axestruck perish
 Left me no joy on earth to cherish
 A man bereftyet sternly now
 I do confirm that Jephtha vow
 Shall I retract or fear or flee
 Did Christ when rose the fatal tree
 Before him on Mount Calvary
 Twas a long fight hard fought but won
 And what I did was justly done

 Yet Helen from thy love I turned
 When my heart most for thy heart burned
 I dared thy tears I dared thy scorn
 Easier the deathpang had been borne
 Helen thou mightst not go with me
 I could notdared not stay for thee
 I heard afar in bonds complain
 The savage from beyond the main
 And that wild sound rose oer the cry
 Wrung out by passions agony
 And even when with the bitterest tear
 I ever shed mine eyes were dim
 Still with the spirits vision clear
 I saw Hells empire vast and grim
 Spread on each Indian rivers shore
 Each realm of Asia covering oer
 There the weak trampled by the strong
 Live but to sufferhopeless die
 There paganpriests whose creed is Wrong
 Extortion Lust and Cruelty
 Crush our lost raceand brimming fill
 The bitter cup of human ill
 And Iwho have the healing creed
 The faith benign of Marys Son
 Shall I behold my brothers need
 And selfishly to aid him shun
 Iwho upon my mothers knees
 In childhood read Christs written word
 Received his legacy of peace
 His holy rule of action heard
 Iin whose heart the sacred sense
 Of Jesus love was early felt
 Of his pure full benevolence
 His pitying tenderness for guilt
 His shepherdcare for wandering sheep
 For all weak sorrowing trembling things
 His mercy vast his passion deep
 Of anguish for mans sufferings
 Ischooled from childhood in such lore
 Dared I draw back or hesitate
 When called to heal the sickness sore
 Of those far off and desolate
 Dark in the realm and shades of Death
 Nations and tribes and empires lie
 But even to them the light of Faith
 Is breaking on their sombre sky
 And be it mine to bid them raise
 Their drooped heads to the kindling scene
 And know and hail the sunrise blaze
 Which heralds Christ the Nazarene
 I know how Hell the veil will spread
 Over their brows and filmy eyes
 And earthward crush the lifted head
 That would look up and seek the skies
 I know what war the fiend will wage
 Against that soldier of the Cross
 Who comes to dare his demon rage
 And work his kingdom shame and loss
 Yes hard and terrible the toil
 Of him who steps on foreign soil
 Resolved to plant the gospel vine
 Where tyrants rule and slaves repine
 Eager to lift Religions light
 Where thickest shades of mental night
 Screen the false god and fiendish rite
 Reckless that missionary blood
 Shed in wild wilderness and wood
 Has left upon the unblest air
 The mans deep moanthe martyrs prayer
 I know my lotI only ask
 Power to fulfil the glorious task
 Willing the spirit may the flesh
 Strength for the day receive afresh
 May burning sun or deadly wind
 Prevail not oer an earnest mind
 May torments strange or direst death
 Nor trample truth nor baffle faith
 Though such blooddrops should fall from me
 As fell in old Gethsemane
 Welcome the anguish so it gave
 More strength to workmore skill to save
 And oh if brief must be my time
 If hostile hand or fatal clime
 Cut short my coursestill oer my grave
 Lord may thy harvest whitening wave
 So I the culture may begin
 Let others thrust the sickle in
 If but the seed will faster grow
 May my blood water what I sow

 What have I ever trembling stood
 And feared to give to God that blood
 What has the coward love of life
 Made me shrink from the righteous strife
 Have human passions human fears
 Severed me from those Pioneers
 Whose task is to march first and trace
 Paths for the progress of our race
 It has been so but grant me Lord
 Now to stand steadfast by Thy word
 Protected by salvations helm
 Shielded by faith with truth begirt
 To smile when trials seek to whelm
 And stand mid testing fires unhurt
 Hurling hells strongest bulwarks down
 Even when the last pang thrills my breast
 When death bestows the martyrs crown
 And calls me into Jesus rest
 Then for my ultimate reward
 Then for the worldrejoicing word
 The voice from FatherSpiritSon
 Servant of God well hast thou done


 




POEMS BY ELLIS BELL




FAITH AND DESPONDENCY

 The winter wind is loud and wild
 Come close to me my darling child
 Forsake thy books and mateless play
 And while the night is gathering gray
 Well talk its pensive hours away

 Ierne round our sheltered hall
 Novembers gusts unheeded call
 Not one faint breath can enter here
 Enough to wave my daughters hair
 And I am glad to watch the blaze
 Glance from her eyes with mimic rays
 To feel her cheek so softly pressed
 In happy quiet on my breast

 But yet even this tranquillity
 Brings bitter restless thoughts to me
 And in the red fires cheerful glow
 I think of deep glens blocked with snow
 I dream of moor and misty hill
 Where evening closes dark and chill
 For lone among the mountains cold
 Lie those that I have loved of old
 And my heart aches in hopeless pain
 Exhausted with repinings vain
 That I shall greet them neer again

 Father in early infancy
 When you were far beyond the sea
 Such thoughts were tyrants over me
 I often sat for hours together
 Through the long nights of angry weather
 Raised on my pillow to descry
 The dim moon struggling in the sky
 Or with strained ear to catch the shock
 Of rock with wave and wave with rock
 So would I fearful vigil keep
 And all for listening never sleep
 But this worlds life has much to dread
 Not so my Father with the dead

 Oh not for them should we despair
 The grave is drear but they are not there
 Their dust is mingled with the sod
 Their happy souls are gone to God
 You told me this and yet you sigh
 And murmur that your friends must die
 Ah my dear father tell me why
 For if your former words were true
 How useless would such sorrow be
 As wise to mourn the seed which grew
 Unnoticed on its parent tree
 Because it fell in fertile earth
 And sprang up to a glorious birth
 Struck deep its root and lifted high
 Its green boughs in the breezy sky

 But Ill not fear I will not weep
 For those whose bodies rest in sleep
 I know there is a blessed shore
 Opening its ports for me and mine
 And gazing Times wide waters oer
 I weary for that land divine
 Where we were born where you and I
 Shall meet our dearest when we die
 From suffering and corruption free
 Restored into the Deity

 Well hast thou spoken sweet trustful child
 And wiser than thy sire
 And worldly tempests raging wild
 Shall strengthen thy desire
 Thy fervent hope through storm and foam
 Through wind and oceans roar
 To reach at last the eternal home
 The steadfast changeless shore




STARS

 Ah why because the dazzling sun
 Restored our Earth to joy
 Have you departed every one
 And left a desert sky

 All through the night your glorious eyes
 Were gazing down in mine
 And with a full hearts thankful sighs
 I blessed that watch divine

 I was at peace and drank your beams
 As they were life to me
 And revelled in my changeful dreams
 Like petrel on the sea

 Thought followed thought star followed star
 Through boundless regions on
 While one sweet influence near and far
 Thrilled through and proved us one

 Why did the morning dawn to break
 So great so pure a spell
 And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek
 Where your cool radiance fell

 Bloodred he rose and arrowstraight
 His fierce beams struck my brow
 The soul of nature sprang elate
 But mine sank sad and low

 My lids closed down yet through their veil
 I saw him blazing still
 And steep in gold the misty dale
 And flash upon the hill

 I turned me to the pillow then
 To call back night and see
 Your worlds of solemn light again
 Throb with my heart and me

 It would not dothe pillow glowed
 And glowed both roof and floor
 And birds sang loudly in the wood
 And fresh winds shook the door

 The curtains waved the wakened flies
 Were murmuring round my room
 Imprisoned there till I should rise
 And give them leave to roam

 Oh stars and dreams and gentle night
 Oh night and stars return
 And hide me from the hostile light
 That does not warm but burn

 That drains the blood of suffering men
 Drinks tears instead of dew
 Let me sleep through his blinding reign
 And only wake with you




THE PHILOSOPHER

 Enough of thought philosopher
 Too long hast thou been dreaming
 Unlightened in this chamber drear
 While summers sun is beaming
 Spacesweeping soul what sad refrain
 Concludes thy musings once again

 Oh for the time when I shall sleep
 Without identity
 And never care how rain may steep
 Or snow may cover me
 No promised heaven these wild desires
 Could all or half fulfil
 No threatened hell with quenchless fires
 Subdue this quenchless will

 So said I and still say the same
 Still to my death will say
 Three gods within this little frame
 Are warring night and day
 Heaven could not hold them all and yet
 They all are held in me
 And must be mine till I forget
 My present entity
 Oh for the time when in my breast
 Their struggles will be oer
 Oh for the day when I shall rest
 And never suffer more

 I saw a spirit standing man
 Where thou dost standan hour ago
 And round his feet three rivers ran
 Of equal depth and equal flow
 A golden streamand one like blood
 And one like sapphire seemed to be
 But where they joined their triple flood
 It tumbled in an inky sea
 The spirit sent his dazzling gaze
 Down through that oceans gloomy night
 Then kindling all with sudden blaze
 The glad deep sparkled wide and bright
 White as the sun far far more fair
 Than its divided sources were

 And even for that spirit seer
 Ive watched and sought my lifetime long
 Sought him in heaven hell earth and air
 An endless search and always wrong
 Had I but seen his glorious eye
 ONCE light the clouds that wilder me
 I neer had raised this coward cry
 To cease to think and cease to be

 I neer had called oblivion blest
 Nor stretching eager hands to death
 Implored to change for senseless rest
 This sentient soul this living breath
 Oh let me diethat power and will
 Their cruel strife may close
 And conquered good and conquering ill
 Be lost in one repose




REMEMBRANCE

 Cold in the earthand the deep snow piled above thee
 Far far removed cold in the dreary grave
 Have I forgot my only Love to love thee
 Severed at last by Times allsevering wave

 Now when alone do my thoughts no longer hover
 Over the mountains on that northern shore
 Resting their wings where heath and fernleaves cover
 Thy noble heart for ever ever more

 Cold in the earthand fifteen wild Decembers
 From those brown hills have melted into spring
 Faithful indeed is the spirit that remembers
 After such years of change and suffering

 Sweet Love of youth forgive if I forget thee
 While the worlds tide is bearing me along
 Other desires and other hopes beset me
 Hopes which obscure but cannot do thee wrong

 No later light has lightened up my heaven
 No second morn has ever shone for me
 All my lifes bliss from thy dear life was given
 All my lifes bliss is in the grave with thee

 But when the days of golden dreams had perished
 And even Despair was powerless to destroy
 Then did I learn how existence could be cherished
 Strengthened and fed without the aid of joy

 Then did I check the tears of useless passion
 Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine
 Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten
 Down to that tomb already more than mine

 And even yet I dare not let it languish
 Dare not indulge in memorys rapturous pain
 Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish
 How could I seek the empty world again




A DEATHSCENE

 O day he cannot die
 When thou so fair art shining
 O Sun in such a glorious sky
 So tranquilly declining

 He cannot leave thee now
 While fresh west winds are blowing
 And all around his youthful brow
 Thy cheerful light is glowing

 Edward awake awake
 The golden evening gleams
 Warm and bright on Ardens lake
 Arouse thee from thy dreams

 Beside thee on my knee
 My dearest friend I pray
 That thou to cross the eternal sea
 Wouldst yet one hour delay

 I hear its billows roar
 I see them foaming high
 But no glimpse of a further shore
 Has blest my straining eye

 Believe not what they urge
 Of Eden isles beyond
 Turn back from that tempestuous surge
 To thy own native land

 It is not death but pain
 That struggles in thy breast
 Nay rally Edward rouse again
 I cannot let thee rest

 One long look that sore reproved me
 For the woe I could not bear
 One mute look of suffering moved me
 To repent my useless prayer

 And with sudden check the heaving
 Of distraction passed away
 Not a sign of further grieving
 Stirred my soul that awful day

 Paled at length the sweet sun setting
 Sunk to peace the twilight breeze
 Summer dews fell softly wetting
 Glen and glade and silent trees

 Then his eyes began to weary
 Weighed beneath a mortal sleep
 And their orbs grew strangely dreary
 Clouded even as they would weep

 But they wept not but they changed not
 Never moved and never closed
 Troubled still and still they ranged not
 Wandered not nor yet reposed

 So I knew that he was dying
 Stooped and raised his languid head
 Felt no breath and heard no sighing
 So I knew that he was dead




SONG

 The linnet in the rocky dells
 The moorlark in the air
 The bee among the heather bells
 That hide my lady fair

 The wild deer browse above her breast
 The wild birds raise their brood
 And they her smiles of love caressed
 Have left her solitude

 I ween that when the graves dark wall
 Did first her form retain
 They thought their hearts could neer recall
 The light of joy again

 They thought the tide of grief would flow
 Unchecked through future years
 But where is all their anguish now
 And where are all their tears

 Well let them fight for honours breath
 Or pleasures shade pursue
 The dweller in the land of death
 Is changed and careless too

 And if their eyes should watch and weep
 Till sorrows source were dry
 She would not in her tranquil sleep
 Return a single sigh

 Blow westwind by the lonely mound
 And murmur summerstreams
 There is no need of other sound
 To soothe my ladys dreams




ANTICIPATION

 How beautiful the earth is still
 To theehow full of happiness
 How little fraught with real ill
 Or unreal phantoms of distress
 How spring can bring thee glory yet
 And summer win thee to forget
 Decembers sullen time
 Why dost thou hold the treasure fast
 Of youths delight when youth is past
 And thou art near thy prime

 When those who were thy own compeers
 Equals in fortune and in years
 Have seen their morning melt in tears
 To clouded smileless day
 Blest had they died untried and young
 Before their hearts went wandering wrong
 Poor slaves subdued by passions strong
 A weak and helpless prey

 Because I hoped while they enjoyed
 And by fulfilment hope destroyed
 As children hope with trustful breast
 I waited blissand cherished rest
 A thoughtful spirit taught me soon
 That we must long till life be done
 That every phase of earthly joy
 Must always fade and always cloy

 This I foresawand would not chase
 The fleeting treacheries
 But with firm foot and tranquil face
 Held backward from that tempting race
 Gazed oer the sands the waves efface
 To the enduring seas
 There cast my anchor of desire
 Deep in unknown eternity
 Nor ever let my spirit tire
 With looking for WHAT IS TO BE

 It is hopes spell that glorifies
 Like youth to my maturer eyes
 All Natures million mysteries
 The fearful and the fair
 Hope soothes me in the griefs I know
 She lulls my pain for others woe
 And makes me strong to undergo
 What I am born to bear

 Glad comforter will I not brave
 Unawed the darkness of the grave
 Nay smile to hear Deaths billows rave
 Sustained my guide by thee
 The more unjust seems present fate
 The more my spirit swells elate
 Strong in thy strength to anticipate
 Rewarding destiny




THE PRISONER

 A FRAGMENT

 In the dungeoncrypts idly did I stray
 Reckless of the lives wasting there away
 Draw the ponderous bars open Warder stern
 He dared not say me naythe hinges harshly turn

 Our guests are darkly lodged I whisperd gazing through
 The vault whose grated eye showed heaven more gray than blue
 This was when glad Spring laughed in awaking pride
 Ay darkly lodged enough returned my sullen guide

 Then God forgive my youth forgive my careless tongue
 I scoffed as the chill chains on the damp flagstones rung
 Confined in triple walls art thou so much to fear
 That we must bind thee down and clench thy fetters here

 The captive raised her face it was as soft and mild
 As sculptured marble saint or slumbering unweand child
 It was so soft and mild it was so sweet and fair
 Pain could not trace a line nor grief a shadow there

 The captive raised her hand and pressed it to her brow
 I have been struck she said and I am suffering now
 Yet these are little worth your bolts and irons strong
 And were they forged in steel they could not hold me long

 Hoarse laughed the jailor grim Shall I be won to hear
 Dost think fond dreaming wretch that I shall grant thy prayer
 Or better still wilt melt my masters heart with groans
 Ah sooner might the sun thaw down these granite stones

 My masters voice is low his aspect bland and kind
 But hard as hardest flint the soul that lurks behind
 And I am rough and rude yet not more rough to see
 Than is the hidden ghost that has its home in me

 About her lips there played a smile of almost scorn
 My friend she gently said you have not heard me mourn
 When you my kindreds lives MY lost life can restore
 Then may I weep and suebut never friend before

 Still let my tyrants know I am not doomed to wear
 Year after year in gloom and desolate despair
 A messenger of Hope comes every night to me
 And offers for short life eternal liberty

 He comes with western winds with evenings wandering airs
 With that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars
 Winds take a pensive tone and stars a tender fire
 And visions rise and change that kill me with desire

 Desire for nothing known in my maturer years
 When Joy grew mad with awe at counting future tears
 When if my spirits sky was full of flashes warm
 I knew not whence they came from sun or thunderstorm

 But first a hush of peacea soundless calm descends
 The struggle of distress and fierce impatience ends
 Mute music soothes my breastunuttered harmony
 That I could never dream till Earth was lost to me

 Then dawns the Invisible the Unseen its truth reveals
 My outward sense is gone my inward essence feels
 Its wings are almost freeits home its harbour found
 Measuring the gulph it stoops and dares the final bound

 Oh I dreadful is the checkintense the agony
 When the ear begins to hear and the eye begins to see
 When the pulse begins to throb the brain to think again
 The soul to feel the flesh and the flesh to feel the chain

 Yet I would lose no sting would wish no torture less
 The more that anguish racks the earlier it will bless
 And robed in fires of hell or bright with heavenly shine
 If it but herald death the vision is divine

 She ceased to speak and we unanswering turned to go
 We had no further power to work the captive woe
 Her cheek her gleaming eye declared that man had given
 A sentence unapproved and overruled by Heaven




HOPE

 Hope Was but a timid friend
 She sat without the grated den
 Watching how my fate would tend
 Even as selfishhearted men

 She was cruel in her fear
 Through the bars one dreary day
 I looked out to see her there
 And she turned her face away

 Like a false guard false watch keeping
 Still in strife she whispered peace
 She would sing while I was weeping
 If I listened she would cease

 False she was and unrelenting
 When my last joys strewed the ground
 Even Sorrow saw repenting
 Those sad relics scattered round

 Hope whose whisper would have given
 Balm to all my frenzied pain
 Stretched her wings and soared to heaven
 Went and neer returned again




A DAY DREAM

 On a sunny brae alone I lay
 One summer afternoon
 It was the marriagetime of May
 With her young lover June

 From her mothers heart seemed loath to part
 That queen of bridal charms
 But her father smiled on the fairest child
 He ever held in his arms

 The trees did wave their plumy crests
 The glad birds carolled clear
 And I of all the wedding guests
 Was only sullen there

 There was not one but wished to shun
 My aspect void of cheer
 The very gray rocks looking on
 Asked What do you here

 And I could utter no reply
 In sooth I did not know
 Why I had brought a clouded eye
 To greet the general glow

 So resting on a heathy bank
 I took my heart to me
 And we together sadly sank
 Into a reverie

 We thought When winter comes again
 Where will these bright things be
 All vanished like a vision vain
 An unreal mockery

 The birds that now so blithely sing
 Through deserts frozen dry
 Poor spectres of the perished spring
 In famished troops will fly

 And why should we be glad at all
 The leaf is hardly green
 Before a token of its fall
 Is on the surface seen

 Now whether it were really so
 I never could be sure
 But as in fit of peevish woe
 I stretched me on the moor

 A thousand thousand gleaming fires
 Seemed kindling in the air
 A thousand thousand silvery lyres
 Resounded far and near

 Methought the very breath I breathed
 Was full of sparks divine
 And all my heathercouch was wreathed
 By that celestial shine

 And while the wide earth echoing rung
 To that strange minstrelsy
 The little glittering spirits sung
 Or seemed to sing to me

 O mortal mortal let them die
 Let time and tears destroy
 That we may overflow the sky
 With universal joy

 Let grief distract the sufferers breast
 And night obscure his way
 They hasten him to endless rest
 And everlasting day

 To thee the world is like a tomb
 A deserts naked shore
 To us in unimagined bloom
 It brightens more and more

 And could we lift the veil and give
 One brief glimpse to thine eye
 Thou wouldst rejoice for those that live
 BECAUSE they live to die

 The music ceased the noonday dream
 Like dream of night withdrew
 But Fancy still will sometimes deem
 Her fond creation true




TO IMAGINATION

 When weary with the long days care
 And earthly change from pain to pain
 And lost and ready to despair
 Thy kind voice calls me back again
 Oh my true friend I am not lone
 While then canst speak with such a tone

 So hopeless is the world without
 The world within I doubly prize
 Thy world where guile and hate and doubt
 And cold suspicion never rise
 Where thou and I and Liberty
 Have undisputed sovereignty

 What matters it that all around
 Danger and guilt and darkness lie
 If but within our bosoms bound
 We hold a bright untroubled sky
 Warm with ten thousand mingled rays
 Of suns that know no winter days

 Reason indeed may oft complain
 For Natures sad reality
 And tell the suffering heart how vain
 Its cherished dreams must always be
 And Truth may rudely trample down
 The flowers of Fancy newlyblown

 But thou art ever there to bring
 The hovering vision back and breathe
 New glories oer the blighted spring
 And call a lovelier Life from Death
 And whisper with a voice divine
 Of real worlds as bright as thine

 I trust not to thy phantom bliss
 Yet still in evenings quiet hour
 With neverfailing thankfulness
 I welcome thee Benignant Power
 Sure solacer of human cares
 And sweeter hope when hope despairs




HOW CLEAR SHE SHINES

 How clear she shines How quietly
 I lie beneath her guardian light
 While heaven and earth are whispering me
 To morrow wake but dream tonight
 Yes Fancy come my Fairy love
 These throbbing temples softly kiss
 And bend my lonely couch above
 And bring me rest and bring me bliss

 The world is going dark world adieu
 Grim world conceal thee till the day
 The heart thou canst not all subdue
 Must still resist if thou delay

 Thy love I will not will not share
 Thy hatred only wakes a smile
 Thy griefs may woundthy wrongs may tear
 But oh thy lies shall neer beguile
 While gazing on the stars that glow
 Above me in that stormless sea
 I long to hope that all the woe
 Creation knows is held in thee

 And this shall be my dream tonight
 Ill think the heaven of glorious spheres
 Is rolling on its course of light
 In endless bliss through endless years
 Ill think theres not one world above
 Far as these straining eyes can see
 Where Wisdom ever laughed at Love
 Or Virtue crouched to Infamy

 Where writhing neath the strokes of Fate
 The mangled wretch was forced to smile
 To match his patience gainst her hate
 His heart rebellious all the while
 Where Pleasure still will lead to wrong
 And helpless Reason warn in vain
 And Truth is weak and Treachery strong
 And Joy the surest path to Pain
 And Peace the lethargy of Grief
 And Hope a phantom of the soul
 And life a labour void and brief
 And Death the despot of the whole




SYMPATHY

 There should be no despair for you
 While nightly stars are burning
 While evening pours its silent dew
 And sunshine gilds the morning
 There should be no despairthough tears
 May flow down like a river
 Are not the best beloved of years
 Around your heart for ever

 They weep you weep it must be so
 Winds sigh as you are sighing
 And winter sheds its grief in snow
 Where Autumns leaves are lying
 Yet these revive and from their fate
 Your fate cannot be parted
 Then journey on if not elate
 Still NEVER brokenhearted




PLEAD FOR ME

 Oh thy bright eyes must answer now
 When Reason with a scornful brow
 Is mocking at my overthrow
 Oh thy sweet tongue must plead for me
 And tell why I have chosen thee

 Stern Reason is to judgment come
 Arrayed in all her forms of gloom
 Wilt thou my advocate be dumb
 No radiant angel speak and say
 Why I did cast the world away

 Why I have persevered to shun
 The common paths that others run
 And on a strange road journeyed on
 Heedless alike of wealth and power
 Of glorys wreath and pleasures flower

 These once indeed seemed Beings Divine
 And they perchance heard vows of mine
 And saw my offerings on their shrine
 But careless gifts are seldom prized
 And MINE were worthily despised

 So with a ready heart I swore
 To seek their altarstone no more
 And gave my spirit to adore
 Thee everpresent phantom thing
 My slave my comrade and my king

 A slave because I rule thee still
 Incline thee to my changeful will
 And make thy influence good or ill
 A comrade for by day and night
 Thou art my intimate delight

 My darling pain that wounds and sears
 And wrings a blessing out from tears
 By deadening me to earthly cares
 And yet a king though Prudence well
 Have taught thy subject to rebel

 And am I wrong to worship where
 Faith cannot doubt nor hope despair
 Since my own soul can grant my prayer
 Speak God of visions plead for me
 And tell why I have chosen thee




SELFINTEROGATION

 The evening passes fast away
 Tis almost time to rest
 What thoughts has left the vanished day
 What feelings in thy breast

 The vanished day It leaves a sense
 Of labour hardly done
 Of little gained with vast expense
 A sense of grief alone

 Time stands before the door of Death
 Upbraiding bitterly
 And Conscience with exhaustless breath
 Pours black reproach on me

 And though Ive said that Conscience lies
 And Time should Fate condemn
 Still sad Repentance clouds my eyes
 And makes me yield to them

 Then art thou glad to seek repose
 Art glad to leave the sea
 And anchor all thy weary woes
 In calm Eternity

 Nothing regrets to see thee go
 Not one voice sobs farewell
 And where thy heart has suffered so
 Canst thou desire to dwell

 Alas the countless links are strong
 That bind us to our clay
 The loving spirit lingers long
 And would not pass away

 And rest is sweet when laurelled fame
 Will crown the soldiers crest
 But a brave heart with a tarnished name
 Would rather fight than rest

 Well thou hast fought for many a year
 Hast fought thy whole life through
 Hast humbled Falsehood trampled Fear
 What is there left to do

 Tis true this arm has hotly striven
 Has dared what few would dare
 Much have I done and freely given
 But little learnt to bear

 Look on the grave where thou must sleep
 Thy last and strongest foe
 It is endurance not to weep
 If that repose seem woe

 The long war closing in defeat
 Defeat serenely borne
 Thy midnight rest may still be sweet
 And break in glorious morn




DEATH

 Death that struck when I was most confiding
 In my certain faith of joy to be
 Strike again Times withered branch dividing
 From the fresh root of Eternity

 Leaves upon Times branch were growing brightly
 Full of sap and full of silver dew
 Birds beneath its shelter gathered nightly
 Daily round its flowers the wild bees flew

 Sorrow passed and plucked the golden blossom
 Guilt stripped off the foliage in its pride
 But within its parents kindly bosom
 Flowed for ever Lifes restoring tide

 Little mourned I for the parted gladness
 For the vacant nest and silent song
 Hope was there and laughed me out of sadness
 Whispering Winter will not linger long

 And behold with tenfold increase blessing
 Spring adorned the beautyburdened spray
 Wind and rain and fervent heat caressing
 Lavished glory on that second May

 High it roseno winged grief could sweep it
 Sin was scared to distance with its shine
 Love and its own life had power to keep it
 From all wrongfrom every blight but thine

 Cruel Death The young leaves droop and languish
 Evenings gentle air may still restore
 No the morning sunshine mocks my anguish
 Time for me must never blossom more

 Strike it down that other boughs may flourish
 Where that perished sapling used to be
 Thus at least its mouldering corpse will nourish
 That from which it sprungEternity




STANZAS TO 

 Well some may hate and some may scorn
 And some may quite forget thy name
 But my sad heart must ever mourn
 Thy ruined hopes thy blighted fame
 Twas thus I thought an hour ago
 Even weeping oer that wretchs woe
 One word turned back my gushing tears
 And lit my altered eye with sneers
 Then Bless the friendly dust I said
 That hides thy unlamented head
 Vain as thou wert and weak as vain
 The slave of Falsehood Pride and Pain
 My heart has nought akin to thine
 Thy soul is powerless over mine
 But these were thoughts that vanished too
 Unwise unholy and untrue
 Do I despise the timid deer
 Because his limbs are fleet with fear
 Or would I mock the wolfs deathhowl
 Because his form is gaunt and foul
 Or hear with joy the leverets cry
 Because it cannot bravely die
 No Then above his memory
 Let Pitys heart as tender be
 Say Earth lie lightly on that breast
 And kind Heaven grant that spirit rest




HONOURS MARTYR

 The moon is full this winter night
 The stars are clear though few
 And every window glistens bright
 With leaves of frozen dew

 The sweet moon through your lattice gleams
 And lights your room like day
 And there you pass in happy dreams
 The peaceful hours away

 While I with effort hardly quelling
 The anguish in my breast
 Wander about the silent dwelling
 And cannot think of rest

 The old clock in the gloomy hall
 Ticks on from hour to hour
 And every time its measured call
 Seems lingering slow and slower

 And oh how slow that keeneyed star
 Has tracked the chilly gray
 What watching yet how very far
 The morning lies away

 Without your chamber door I stand
 Love are you slumbering still
 My cold heart underneath my hand
 Has almost ceased to thrill

 Bleak bleak the east wind sobs and sighs
 And drowns the turret bell
 Whose sad note undistinguished dies
 Unheard like my farewell

 Tomorrow Scorn will blight my name
 And Hate will trample me
 Will load me with a cowards shame
 A traitors perjury

 False friends will launch their covert sneers
 True friends will wish me dead
 And I shall cause the bitterest tears
 That you have ever shed

 The dark deeds of my outlawed race
 Will then like virtues shine
 And men will pardon their disgrace
 Beside the guilt of mine

 For who forgives the accursed crime
 Of dastard treachery
 Rebellion in its chosen time
 May Freedoms champion be

 Revenge may stain a righteous sword
 It may be just to slay
 But traitor traitorfrom THAT word
 All true breasts shrink away

 Oh I would give my heart to death
 To keep my honour fair
 Yet Ill not give my inward faith
 My honours NAME to spare

 Not even to keep your priceless love
 Dare I Beloved deceive
 This treason should the future prove
 Then only then believe

 I know the path I ought to go
 I follow fearlessly
 Inquiring not what deeper woe
 Stern duty stores for me

 So foes pursue and cold allies
 Mistrust me every one
 Let me be false in others eyes
 If faithful in my own




STANZAS

 Ill not weep that thou art going to leave me
 Theres nothing lovely here
 And doubly will the dark world grieve me
 While thy heart suffers there

 Ill not weep because the summers glory
 Must always end in gloom
 And follow out the happiest story
 It closes with a tomb

 And I am weary of the anguish
 Increasing winters bear
 Weary to watch the spirit languish
 Through years of dead despair

 So if a tear when thou art dying
 Should haply fall from me
 It is but that my soul is sighing
 To go and rest with thee




MY COMFORTER

 Well hast thou spoken and yet not taught
 A feeling strange or new
 Thou hast but roused a latent thought
 A cloudclosed beam of sunshine brought
 To gleam in open view

 Deep down concealed within my soul
 That light lies hid from men
 Yet glows unquenchedthough shadows roll
 Its gentle ray cannot control
 About the sullen den

 Was I not vexed in these gloomy ways
 To walk alone so long
 Around me wretches uttering praise
 Or howling oer their hopeless days
 And each with Frenzys tongue

 A brotherhood of misery
 Their smiles as sad as sighs
 Whose madness daily maddened me
 Distorting into agony
 The bliss before my eyes

 So stood I in Heavens glorious sun
 And in the glare of Hell
 My spirit drank a mingled tone
 Of seraphs song and demons moan
 What my soul bore my soul alone
 Within itself may tell

 Like a soft air above a sea
 Tossed by the tempests stir
 A thawwind melting quietly
 The snowdrift on some wintry lea
 No what sweet thing resembles thee
 My thoughtful Comforter

 And yet a little longer speak
 Calm this resentful mood
 And while the savage heart grows meek
 For other token do not seek
 But let the tear upon my cheek
 Evince my gratitude




THE OLD STOIC

 Riches I hold in light esteem
 And Love I laugh to scorn
 And lust of fame was but a dream
 That vanished with the morn

 And if I pray the only prayer
 That moves my lips for me
 Is Leave the heart that now I bear
 And give me liberty

 Yes as my swift days near their goal
 Tis all that I implore
 In life and death a chainless soul
 With courage to endure


 





POEMS BY ACTON BELL




A REMINISCENCE

 Yes thou art gone and never more
 Thy sunny smile shall gladden me
 But I may pass the old church door
 And pace the floor that covers thee

 May stand upon the cold damp stone
 And think that frozen lies below
 The lightest heart that I have known
 The kindest I shall ever know

 Yet though I cannot see thee more
 Tis still a comfort to have seen
 And though thy transient life is oer
 Tis sweet to think that thou hast been

 To think a soul so near divine
 Within a form so angel fair
 United to a heart like thine
 Has gladdened once our humble sphere




THE ARBOUR

 Ill rest me in this sheltered bower
 And look upon the clear blue sky
 That smiles upon me through the trees
 Which stand so thick clustering by

 And view their green and glossy leaves
 All glistening in the sunshine fair
 And list the rustling of their boughs
 So softly whispering through the air

 And while my ear drinks in the sound
 My winged soul shall fly away
 Reviewing lone departed years
 As one mild beaming autumn day

 And soaring on to future scenes
 Like hills and woods and valleys green
 All basking in the summers sun
 But distant still and dimly seen

 Oh list tis summers very breath
 That gently shakes the rustling trees
 But look the snow is on the ground
 How can I think of scenes like these

 Tis but the FROST that clears the air
 And gives the sky that lovely blue
 Theyre smiling in a WINTERS sun
 Those evergreens of sombre hue

 And winters chill is on my heart
 How can I dream of future bliss
 How can my spirit soar away
 Confined by such a chain as this




HOME

 How brightly glistening in the sun
 The woodland ivy plays
 While yonder beeches from their barks
 Reflect his silver rays

 That sun surveys a lovely scene
 From softly smiling skies
 And wildly through unnumbered trees
 The wind of winter sighs

 Now loud it thunders oer my head
 And now in distance dies
 But give me back my barren hills
 Where colder breezes rise

 Where scarce the scattered stunted trees
 Can yield an answering swell
 But where a wilderness of heath
 Returns the sound as well

 For yonder garden fair and wide
 With groves of evergreen
 Long winding walks and borders trim
 And velvet lawns between

 Restore to me that little spot
 With gray walls compassed round
 Where knotted grass neglected lies
 And weeds usurp the ground

 Though all around this mansion high
 Invites the foot to roam
 And though its halls are fair within
 Oh give me back my HOME




VANITAS VANITATUM OMNIA VANITAS

 In all we do and hear and see
 Is restless Toil and Vanity
 While yet the rolling earth abides
 Men come and go like ocean tides

 And ere one generation dies
 Another in its place shall rise
 THAT sinking soon into the grave
 Others succeed like wave on wave

 And as they rise they pass away
 The sun arises every day
 And hastening onward to the West
 He nightly sinks but not to rest

 Returning to the eastern skies
 Again to light us he must rise
 And still the restless wind comes forth
 Now blowing keenly from the North

 Now from the South the East the West
 For ever changing neer at rest
 The fountains gushing from the hills
 Supply the everrunning rills

 The thirsty rivers drink their store
 And bear it rolling to the shore
 But still the ocean craves for more
 Tis endless labour everywhere
 Sound cannot satisfy the ear

 Light cannot fill the craving eye
 Nor riches half our wants supply
 Pleasure but doubles future pain
 And joy brings sorrow in her train

 Laughter is mad and reckless mirth
 What does she in this weary earth
 Should Wealth or Fame our Life employ
 Death comes our labour to destroy

 To snatch the untasted cup away
 For which we toiled so many a day
 What then remains for wretched man
 To use lifes comforts while he can

 Enjoy the blessings Heaven bestows
 Assist his friends forgive his foes
 Trust God and keep His statutes still
 Upright and firm through good and ill

 Thankful for all that God has given
 Fixing his firmest hopes on Heaven
 Knowing that earthly joys decay
 But hoping through the darkest day




THE PENITENT

 I mourn with thee and yet rejoice
 That thou shouldst sorrow so
 With angel choirs I join my voice
 To bless the sinners woe

 Though friends and kindred turn away
 And laugh thy grief to scorn
 I hear the great Redeemer say
 Blessed are ye that mourn

 Hold on thy course nor deem it strange
 That earthly cords are riven
 Man may lament the wondrous change
 But there is joy in heaven




MUSIC ON CHRISTMAS MORNING

 Music I lovebut never strain
 Could kindle raptures so divine
 So grief assuage so conquer pain
 And rouse this pensive heart of mine
 As that we hear on Christmas morn
 Upon the wintry breezes borne

 Though Darkness still her empire keep
 And hours must pass ere morning break
 From troubled dreams or slumbers deep
 That music KINDLY bids us wake
 It calls us with an angels voice
 To wake and worship and rejoice

 To greet with joy the glorious morn
 Which angels welcomed long ago
 When our redeeming Lord was born
 To bring the light of Heaven below
 The Powers of Darkness to dispel
 And rescue Earth from Death and Hell

 While listening to that sacred strain
 My raptured spirit soars on high
 I seem to hear those songs again
 Resounding through the open sky
 That kindled such divine delight
 In those who watched their flocks by night

 With them I celebrate His birth
 Glory to God in highest Heaven
 Goodwill to men and peace on earth
 To us a Saviourking is given
 Our God is come to claim His own
 And Satans power is overthrown

 A sinless God for sinful men
 Descends to suffer and to bleed
 Hell MUST renounce its empire then
 The price is paid the world is freed
 And Satans self must now confess
 That Christ has earned a RIGHT to bless

 Now holy Peace may smile from heaven
 And heavenly Truth from earth shall spring
 The captives galling bonds are riven
 For our Redeemer is our king
 And He that gave his blood for men
 Will lead us home to God again




STANZAS

 Oh weep not love each tear that springs
 In those dear eyes of thine
 To me a keener suffering brings
 Than if they flowed from mine

 And do not droop however drear
 The fate awaiting thee
 For MY sake combat pain and care
 And cherish life for me

 I do not fear thy love will fail
 Thy faith is true I know
 But oh my love thy strength is frail
 For such a life of woe

 Were t not for this I well could trace
 Though banished long from thee
 Lifes rugged path and boldly face
 The storms that threaten me

 Fear not for meIve steeled my mind
 Sorrow and strife to greet
 Joy with my love I leave behind
 Care with my friends I meet

 A mothers sad reproachful eye
 A fathers scowling brow
 But he may frown and she may sigh
 I will not break my vow

 I love my mother I revere
 My sire but fear not me
 Believe that Death alone can tear
 This faithful heart from thee




IF THIS BE ALL

 O God if this indeed be all
 That Life can show to me
 If on my aching brow may fall
 No freshening dew from Thee

 If with no brighter light than this
 The lamp of hope may glow
 And I may only dream of bliss
 And wake to weary woe

 If friendships solace must decay
 When other joys are gone
 And love must keep so far away
 While I go wandering on

 Wandering and toiling without gain
 The slave of others will
 With constant care and frequent pain
 Despised forgotten still

 Grieving to look on vice and sin
 Yet powerless to quell
 The silent current from within
 The outward torrents swell

 While all the good I would impart
 The feelings I would share
 Are driven backward to my heart
 And turned to wormwood there

 If clouds must EVER keep from sight
 The glories of the Sun
 And I must suffer Winters blight
 Ere Summer is begun

 If Life must be so full of care
 Then call me soon to thee
 Or give me strength enough to bear
 My load of misery




MEMORY

 Brightly the sun of summer shone
 Green fields and waving woods upon
 And soft winds wandered by
 Above a sky of purest blue
 Around bright flowers of loveliest hue
 Allured the gazers eye

 But what were all these charms to me
 When one sweet breath of memory
 Came gently wafting by
 I closed my eyes against the day
 And called my willing soul away
 From earth and air and sky

 That I might simply fancy there
 One little flowera primrose fair
 Just opening into sight
 As in the days of infancy
 An opening primrose seemed to me
 A source of strange delight

 Sweet Memory ever smile on me
 Natures chief beauties spring from thee
 Oh still thy tribute bring
 Still make the golden crocus shine
 Among the flowers the most divine
 The glory of the spring

 Still in the wallflowers fragrance dwell
 And hover round the slight bluebell
 My childhoods darling flower
 Smile on the little daisy still
 The buttercups bright goblet fill
 With all thy former power

 For ever hang thy dreamy spell
 Round mountain star and heather bell
 And do not pass away
 From sparkling frost or wreathed snow
 And whisper when the wild winds blow
 Or rippling waters play

 Is childhood then so all divine
 Or Memory is the glory thine
 That haloes thus the past
 Not ALL divine its pangs of grief
 Although perchance their stay be brief
 Are bitter while they last

 Nor is the glory all thine own
 For on our earliest joys alone
 That holy light is cast
 With such a ray no spell of thine
 Can make our later pleasures shine
 Though long ago they passed




TO COWPER

 Sweet are thy strains celestial Bard
 And oft in childhoods years
 Ive read them oer and oer again
 With floods of silent tears

 The language of my inmost heart
 I traced in every line
 MY sins MY sorrows hopes and fears
 Were thereand only mine

 All for myself the sigh would swell
 The tear of anguish start
 I little knew what wilder woe
 Had filled the Poets heart

 I did not know the nights of gloom
 The days of misery
 The long long years of dark despair
 That crushed and tortured thee

 But they are gone from earth at length
 Thy gentle soul is passd
 And in the bosom of its God
 Has found its home at last

 It must be so if God is love
 And answers fervent prayer
 Then surely thou shalt dwell on high
 And I may meet thee there

 Is He the source of every good
 The spring of purity
 Then in thine hours of deepest woe
 Thy God was still with thee

 How else when every hope was fled
 Couldst thou so fondly cling
 To holy things and help men
 And how so sweetly sing

 Of things that God alone could teach
 And whence that purity
 That hatred of all sinful ways
 That gentle charity

 Are THESE the symptoms of a heart
 Of heavenly grace bereft
 For ever banished from its God
 To Satans fury left

 Yet should thy darkest fears be true
 If Heaven be so severe
 That such a soul as thine is lost
 Oh how shall I appear




THE DOUBTERS PRAYER

 Eternal Power of earth and air
 Unseen yet seen in all around
 Remote but dwelling everywhere
 Though silent heard in every sound

 If eer thine ear in mercy bent
 When wretched mortals cried to Thee
 And if indeed Thy Son was sent
 To save lost sinners such as me

 Then hear me now while kneeling here
 I lift to thee my heart and eye
 And all my soul ascends in prayer
 OH GIVE MEGIVE ME FAITH I cry

 Without some glimmering in my heart
 I could not raise this fervent prayer
 But oh a stronger light impart
 And in Thy mercy fix it there

 While Faith is with me I am blest
 It turns my darkest night to day
 But while I clasp it to my breast
 I often feel it slide away

 Then cold and dark my spirit sinks
 To see my light of life depart
 And every fiend of Hell methinks
 Enjoys the anguish of my heart

 What shall I do if all my love
 My hopes my toil are cast away
 And if there be no God above
 To hear and bless me when I pray

 If this be vain delusion all
 If death be an eternal sleep
 And none can hear my secret call
 Or see the silent tears I weep

 Oh help me God For thou alone
 Canst my distracted soul relieve
 Forsake it not it is thine own
 Though weak yet longing to believe

 Oh drive these cruel doubts away
 And make me know that Thou art God
 A faith that shines by night and day
 Will lighten every earthly load

 If I believe that Jesus died
 And waking rose to reign above
 Then surely Sorrow Sin and Pride
 Must yield to Peace and Hope and Love

 And all the blessed words He said
 Will strength and holy joy impart
 A shield of safety oer my head
 A spring of comfort in my heart




A WORD TO THE ELECT

 You may rejoice to think YOURSELVES secure
 You may be grateful for the gift divine
 That grace unsought which made your black hearts pure
 And fits your earthborn souls in Heaven to shine

 But is it sweet to look around and view
 Thousands excluded from that happiness
 Which they deserved at least as much as you
 Their faults not greater nor their virtues less

 And wherefore should you love your God the more
 Because to you alone his smiles are given
 Because He chose to pass the MANY oer
 And only bring the favoured FEW to Heaven

 And wherefore should your hearts more grateful prove
 Because for ALL the Saviour did not die
 Is yours the God of justice and of love
 And are your bosoms warm with charity

 Say does your heart expand to all mankind
 And would you ever to your neighbour do
 The weak the strong the enlightened and the blind
 As you would have your neighbour do to you

 And when you looking on your fellowmen
 Behold them doomed to endless misery
 How can you talk of joy and rapture then
 May God withhold such cruel joy from me

 That none deserve eternal bliss I know
 Unmerited the grace in mercy given
 But none shall sink to everlasting woe
 That have not well deserved the wrath of Heaven

 And oh there lives within my heart
 A hope long nursed by me
 And should its cheering ray depart
 How dark my soul would be

 That as in Adam all have died
 In Christ shall all men live
 And ever round his throne abide
 Eternal praise to give

 That even the wicked shall at last
 Be fitted for the skies
 And when their dreadful doom is past
 To life and light arise

 I ask not how remote the day
 Nor what the sinners woe
 Before their dross is purged away
 Enough for me to know

 That when the cup of wrath is drained
 The metal purified
 Theyll cling to what they once disdained
 And live by Him that died




PAST DAYS

 Tis strange to think there WAS a time
 When mirth was not an empty name
 When laughter really cheered the heart
 And frequent smiles unbidden came
 And tears of grief would only flow
 In sympathy for others woe

 When speech expressed the inward thought
 And heart to kindred heart was bare
 And summer days were far too short
 For all the pleasures crowded there
 And silence solitude and rest
 Now welcome to the weary breast

 Were all unprized uncourted then
 And all the joy one spirit showed
 The other deeply felt again
 And friendship like a river flowed
 Constant and strong its silent course
 For nought withstood its gentle force

 When night the holy time of peace
 Was dreaded as the parting hour
 When speech and mirth at once must cease
 And silence must resume her power
 Though ever free from pains and woes
 She only brought us calm repose

 And when the blessed dawn again
 Brought daylight to the blushing skies
 We woke and not RELUCTANT then
 To joyless LABOUR did we rise
 But full of hope and glad and gay
 We welcomed the returning day




THE CONSOLATION

 Though bleak these woods and damp the ground
 With fallen leaves so thickly strown
 And cold the wind that wanders round
 With wild and melancholy moan

 There IS a friendly roof I know
 Might shield me from the wintry blast
 There is a fire whose ruddy glow
 Will cheer me for my wanderings past

 And so though still whereer I go
 Cold strangerglances meet my eye
 Though when my spirit sinks in woe
 Unheeded swells the unbidden sigh

 Though solitude endured too long
 Bids youthful joys too soon decay
 Makes mirth a stranger to my tongue
 And overclouds my noon of day

 When kindly thoughts that would have way
 Flow back discouraged to my breast
 I know there is though far away
 A home where heart and soul may rest

 Warm hands are there that clasped in mine
 The warmer heart will not belie
 While mirth and truth and friendship shine
 In smiling lip and earnest eye

 The ice that gathers round my heart
 May there be thawed and sweetly then
 The joys of youth that now depart
 Will come to cheer my soul again

 Though far I roam that thought shall be
 My hope my comfort everywhere
 While such a home remains to me
 My heart shall never know despair




LINES COMPOSED IN A WOOD ON A WINDY DAY

 My soul is awakened my spirit is soaring
 And carried aloft on the wings of the breeze
 For above and around me the wild wind is roaring
 Arousing to rapture the earth and the seas

 The long withered grass in the sunshine is glancing
 The bare trees are tossing their branches on high
 The dead leaves beneath them are merrily dancing
 The white clouds are scudding across the blue sky

 I wish I could see how the ocean is lashing
 The foam of its billows to whirlwinds of spray
 I wish I could see how its proud waves are dashing
 And hear the wild roar of their thunder today




VIEWS OF LIFE

 When sinks my heart in hopeless gloom
 And life can show no joy for me
 And I behold a yawning tomb
 Where bowers and palaces should be

 In vain you talk of morbid dreams
 In vain you gaily smiling say
 That what to me so dreary seems
 The healthy mind deems bright and gay

 I too have smiled and thought like you
 But madly smiled and falsely deemed
 TRUTH led me to the present view
 Im waking nowtwas THEN I dreamed

 I lately saw a sunset sky
 And stood enraptured to behold
 Its varied hues of glorious dye
 First fleecy clouds of shining gold

 These blushing took a rosy hue
 Beneath them shone a flood of green
 Nor less divine the glorious blue
 That smiled above them and between

 I cannot name each lovely shade
 I cannot say how bright they shone
 But one by one I saw them fade
 And what remained when they were gone

 Dull clouds remained of sombre hue
 And when their borrowed charm was oer
 The azure sky had faded too
 That smiled so softly bright before

 So gilded by the glow of youth
 Our varied life looks fair and gay
 And so remains the naked truth
 When that false light is past away

 Why blame ye then my keener sight
 That clearly sees a world of woes
 Through all the haze of golden light
 That flattering Falsehood round it throws

 When the young mother smiles above
 The firstborn darling of her heart
 Her bosom glows with earnest love
 While tears of silent transport start

 Fond dreamer little does she know
 The anxious toil the suffering
 The blasted hopes the burning woe
 The object of her joy will bring

 Her blinded eyes behold not now
 What soon or late must be his doom
 The anguish that will cloud his brow
 The bed of death the dreary tomb

 As little know the youthful pair
 In mutual love supremely blest
 What weariness and cold despair
 Ere long will seize the aching breast

 And even should Love and Faith remain
 The greatest blessings life can show
 Amid adversity and pain
 To shine throughout with cheering glow

 They do not see how cruel Death
 Comes on their loving hearts to part
 One feels not now the gasping breath
 The rending of the earthbound heart

 The souls and bodys agony
 Ere she may sink to her repose
 The sad survivor cannot see
 The grave above his darling close

 Nor how despairing and alone
 He then must wear his life away
 And linger feebly toiling on
 And fainting sink into decay

    

 Oh Youth may listen patiently
 While sad Experience tells her tale
 But Doubt sits smiling in his eye
 For ardent Hope will still prevail

 He hears how feeble Pleasure dies
 By guilt destroyed and pain and woe
 He turns to Hopeand she replies
 Believe it notit is not so

 Oh heed her not Experience says
 For thus she whispered once to me
 She told me in my youthful days
 How glorious manhoods prime would be

 When in the time of early Spring
 Too chill the winds that oer me passd
 She said each coming day would bring
 a fairer heaven a gentler blast

 And when the sun too seldom beamed
 The sky oercast too darkly frowned
 The soaking rain too constant streamed
 And mists too dreary gathered round

 She told me Summers glorious ray
 Would chase those vapours all away
 And scatter glories round
 With sweetest music fill the trees
 Load with rich scent the gentle breeze
 And strew with flowers the ground

 But when beneath that scorching ray
 I languished weary through the day
 While birds refused to sing
 Verdure decayed from field and tree
 And panting Nature mourned with me
 The freshness of the Spring

 Wait but a little while she said
 Till Summers burning days are fled
 And Autumn shall restore
 With golden riches of her own
 And Summers glories mellowed down
 The freshness you deplore

 And long I waited but in vain
 That freshness never came again
 Though Summer passed away
 Though Autumns mists hung cold and chill
 And drooping nature languished still
 And sank into decay

 Till wintry blasts foreboding blew
 Through leafless treesand then I knew
 That Hope was all a dream
 But thus fond youth she cheated me
 And she will prove as false to thee
 Though sweet her words may seem

 Stern prophet Cease thy bodings dire
 Thou canst not quench the ardent fire
 That warms the breast of youth
 Oh let it cheer him while it may
 And gently gently die away
 Chilled by the damps of truth

 Tell him that earth is not our rest
 Its joys are emptyfrail at best
 And point beyond the sky
 But gleams of light may reach us here
 And hope the ROUGHEST path can cheer
 Then do not bid it fly

 Though hope may promise joys that still
 Unkindly time will neer fulfil
 Or if they come at all
 We never find them unalloyed
 Hurtful perchance or soon destroyed
 They vanish or they pall

 Yet hope ITSELF a brightness throws
 Oer all our labours and our woes
 While dark foreboding Care
 A thousand ills will oft portend
 That Providence may neer intend
 The trembling heart to bear

 Or if they come it oft appears
 Our woes are lighter than our fears
 And far more bravely borne
 Then let us not enhance our doom
 But een in midnights blackest gloom
 Expect the rising morn

 Because the road is rough and long
 Shall we despise the skylarks song
 That cheers the wanderers way
 Or trample down with reckless feet
 The smiling flowerets bright and sweet
 Because they soon decay

 Pass pleasant scenes unnoticed by
 Because the next is bleak and drear
 Or not enjoy a smiling sky
 Because a tempest may be near

 No while we journey on our way
 Well smile on every lovely thing
 And ever as they pass away
 To memory and hope well cling

 And though that awful river flows
 Before us when the journeys past
 Perchance of all the pilgrims woes
 Most dreadfulshrink nottis the last

 Though icy cold and dark and deep
 Beyond it smiles that blessed shore
 Where none shall suffer none shall weep
 And bliss shall reign for evermore




APPEAL

 Oh I am very weary
 Though tears no longer flow
 My eyes are tired of weeping
 My heart is sick of woe

 My life is very lonely
 My days pass heavily
 Im weary of repining
 Wilt thou not come to me

 Oh didst thou know my longings
 For thee from day to day
 My hopes so often blighted
 Thou wouldst not thus delay




THE STUDENTS SERENADE

 I have slept upon my couch
 But my spirit did not rest
 For the labours of the day
 Yet my weary soul opprest

 And before my dreaming eyes
 Still the learned volumes lay
 And I could not close their leaves
 And I could not turn away

 But I oped my eyes at last
 And I heard a muffled sound
 Twas the nightbreeze come to say
 That the snow was on the ground

 Then I knew that there was rest
 On the mountains bosom free
 So I left my fevered couch
 And I flew to waken thee

 I have flown to waken thee
 For if thou wilt not arise
 Then my soul can drink no peace
 From these holy moonlight skies

 And this waste of virgin snow
 To my sight will not be fair
 Unless thou wilt smiling come
 Love to wander with me there

 Then awake Maria wake
 For if thou couldst only know
 How the quiet moonlight sleeps
 On this wilderness of snow

 And the groves of ancient trees
 In their snowy garb arrayed
 Till they stretch into the gloom
 Of the distant valleys shade

 I know thou wouldst rejoice
 To inhale this bracing air
 Thou wouldst break thy sweetest sleep
 To behold a scene so fair

 Oer these wintry wilds ALONE
 Thou wouldst joy to wander free
 And it will not please thee less
 Though that bliss be shared with me




THE CAPTIVE DOVE

 Poor restless dove I pity thee
 And when I hear thy plaintive moan
 I mourn for thy captivity
 And in thy woes forget mine own

 To see thee stand prepared to fly
 And flap those useless wings of thine
 And gaze into the distant sky
 Would melt a harder heart than mine

 In vainin vain Thou canst not rise
 Thy prison roof confines thee there
 Its slender wires delude thine eyes
 And quench thy longings with despair

 Oh thou wert made to wander free
 In sunny mead and shady grove
 And far beyond the rolling sea
 In distant climes at will to rove

 Yet hadst thou but one gentle mate
 Thy little drooping heart to cheer
 And share with thee thy captive state
 Thou couldst be happy even there

 Yes even there if listening by
 One faithful dear companion stood
 While gazing on her full bright eye
 Thou mightst forget thy native wood

 But thou poor solitary dove
 Must make unheard thy joyless moan
 The heart that Nature formed to love
 Must pine neglected and alone




SELFCONGRATULATION

 Ellen you were thoughtless once
 Of beauty or of grace
 Simple and homely in attire
 Careless of form and face
 Then whence this change and wherefore now
 So often smoothe your hair
 And wherefore deck your youthful form
 With such unwearied care

 Tell us and cease to tire our ears
 With that familiar strain
 Why will you play those simple tunes
 So often oer again
 Indeed dear friends I can but say
 That childhoods thoughts are gone
 Each year its own new feelings brings
 And years move swiftly on

 And for these little simple airs
 I love to play them oer
 So muchI dare not promise now
 To play them never more
 I answeredand it was enough
 They turned them to depart
 They could not read my secret thoughts
 Nor see my throbbing heart

 Ive noticed many a youthful form
 Upon whose changeful face
 The inmost workings of the soul
 The gazer well might trace
 The speaking eye the changing lip
 The ready blushing cheek
 The smiling or beclouded brow
 Their different feelings speak

 But thank God you might gaze on mine
 For hours and never know
 The secret changes of my soul
 From joy to keenest woe
 Last night as we sat round the fire
 Conversing merrily
 We heard without approaching steps
 Of one well known to me

 There was no trembling in my voice
 No blush upon my cheek
 No lustrous sparkle in my eyes
 Of hope or joy to speak
 But oh my spirit burned within
 My heart beat full and fast
 He came not nighhe went away
 And then my joy was past

 And yet my comrades marked it not
 My voice was still the same
 They saw me smile and oer my face
 No signs of sadness came
 They little knew my hidden thoughts
 And they will NEVER know
 The aching anguish of my heart
 The bitter burning woe




FLUCTUATIONS

 What though the Sun had left my sky
 To save me from despair
 The blessed Moon arose on high
 And shone serenely there

 I watched her with a tearful gaze
 Rise slowly oer the hill
 While through the dim horizons haze
 Her light gleamed faint and chill

 I thought such wan and lifeless beams
 Could neer my heart repay
 For the bright suns most transient gleams
 That cheered me through the day

 But as above that mists control
 She rose and brighter shone
 I felt her light upon my soul
 But nowthat light is gone

 Thick vapours snatched her from my sight
 And I was darkling left
 All in the cold and gloomy night
 Of light and hope bereft

 Until methought a little star
 Shone forth with trembling ray
 To cheer me with its light afar
 But that too passed away

 Anon an earthly meteor blazed
 The gloomy darkness through
 I smiled yet trembled while I gazed
 But that soon vanished too

 And darker drearier fell the night
 Upon my spirit then
 But what is that faint struggling light
 Is it the Moon again

 Kind Heaven increase that silvery gleam
 And bid these clouds depart
 And let her soft celestial beam
 Restore my fainting heart





SELECTIONS FROM THE LITERARY REMAINS OF ELLIS AND ACTON BELL

By Currer Bell




SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL

It would not have been difficult to compile a volume out of the papers
left by my sisters had I in making the selection dismissed from my
consideration the scruples and the wishes of those whose written
thoughts these papers held But this was impossible an influence
stronger than could be exercised by any motive of expediency
necessarily regulated the selection I have then culled from the mass
only a little poem here and there The whole makes but a tiny nosegay
and the colour and perfume of the flowers are not such as fit them for
festal uses

It has been already said that my sisters wrote much in childhood and
girlhood Usually it seems a sort of injustice to expose in print the
crude thoughts of the unripe mind the rude efforts of the unpractised
hand yet I venture to give three little poems of my sister Emilys
written in her sixteenth year because they illustrate a point in her
character

At that period she was sent to school Her previous life with the
exception of a single halfyear had been passed in the absolute
retirement of a village parsonage amongst the hills bordering Yorkshire
and Lancashire The scenery of these hills is not grandit is not
romantic it is scarcely striking Long low moors dark with heath shut
in little valleys where a stream waters here and there a fringe of
stunted copse Mills and scattered cottages chase romance from these
valleys it is only higher up deep in amongst the ridges of the moors
that Imagination can find rest for the sole of her foot and even if she
finds it there she must be a solitudeloving ravenno gentle dove If
she demand beauty to inspire her she must bring it inborn these moors
are too stern to yield any product so delicate The eye of the gazer
must ITSELF brim with a purple light intense enough to perpetuate the
brief flowerflush of August on the heather or the rare sunsetsmile of
June out of his heart must well the freshness that in latter spring
and early summer brightens the bracken nurtures the moss and cherishes
the starry flowers that spangle for a few weeks the pasture of the
moorsheep Unless that light and freshness are innate and selfsustained
the drear prospect of a Yorkshire moor will be found as barren of poetic
as of agricultural interest where the love of wild nature is strong
the locality will perhaps be clung to with the more passionate
constancy because from the hilllovers self comes half its charm

My sister Emily loved the moors Flowers brighter than the rose bloomed
in the blackest of the heath for her out of a sullen hollow in a livid
hillside her mind could make an Eden She found in the bleak solitude
many and dear delights and not the least and best loved wasliberty

Liberty was the breath of Emilys nostrils without it she perished
The change from her own home to a school and from her own very
noiseless very secluded but unrestricted and inartificial mode of
life to one of disciplined routine though under the kindliest
auspices was what she failed in enduring Her nature proved here too
strong for her fortitude Every morning when she woke the vision of
home and the moors rushed on her and darkened and saddened the day that
lay before her Nobody knew what ailed her but meI knew only too well
In this struggle her health was quickly broken her white face
attenuated form and failing strength threatened rapid decline I felt
in my heart she would die if she did not go home and with this
conviction obtained her recall She had only been three months at
school and it was some years before the experiment of sending her from
home was again ventured on After the age of twenty having meantime
studied alone with diligence and perseverance she went with me to an
establishment on the Continent the same suffering and conflict ensued
heightened by the strong recoil of her upright heretic and English
spirit from the gentle Jesuitry of the foreign and Romish system Once
more she seemed sinking but this time she rallied through the mere
force of resolution with inward remorse and shame she looked back on
her former failure and resolved to conquer in this second ordeal She
did conquer but the victory cost her dear She was never happy till she
carried her hardwon knowledge back to the remote English village the
old parsonagehouse and desolate Yorkshire hills A very few years
more and she looked her last on those hills and breathed her last in
that house and under the aisle of that obscure village church found her
last lowly restingplace Merciful was the decree that spared her when
she was a stranger in a strange land and guarded her dying bed with
kindred love and congenial constancy

The following pieces were composed at twilight in the schoolroom when
the leisure of the evening playhour brought back in full tide the
thoughts of home




I

 A LITTLE while a little while
 The weary task is put away
 And I can sing and I can smile
 Alike while I have holiday

 Where wilt thou go my harassed heart
 What thought what scene invites thee now
 What spot or near or far apart
 Has rest for thee my weary brow

 There is a spot mid barren hills
 Where winter howls and driving rain
 But if the dreary tempest chills
 There is a light that warms again

 The house is old the trees are bare
 Moonless above bends twilights dome
 But what on earth is half so dear
 So longed foras the hearth of home

 The mute bird sitting on the stone
 The dank moss dripping from the wall
 The thorntrees gaunt the walks oergrown
 I love themhow I love them all

 Still as I mused the naked room
 The alien firelight died away
 And from the midst of cheerless gloom
 I passed to bright unclouded day

 A little and a lone green lane
 That opened on a common wide
 A distant dreamy dim blue chain
 Of mountains circling every side

 A heaven so clear an earth so calm
 So sweet so soft so hushed an air
 And deepening still the dreamlike charm
 Wild moorsheep feeding everywhere

 THAT was the scene I knew it well
 I knew the turfy pathways sweep
 That winding oer each billowy swell
 Marked out the tracks of wandering sheep

 Could I have lingered but an hour
 It well had paid a week of toil
 But Truth has banished Fancys power
 Restraint and heavy task recoil

 Even as I stood with raptured eye
 Absorbed in bliss so deep and dear
 My hour of rest had fleeted by
 And back came labour bondage care




II THE BLUEBELL

 The Bluebell is the sweetest flower
 That waves in summer air
 Its blossoms have the mightiest power
 To soothe my spirits care

 There is a spell in purple heath
 Too wildly sadly dear
 The violet has a fragrant breath
 But fragrance will not cheer

 The trees are bare the sun is cold
 And seldom seldom seen
 The heavens have lost their zone of gold
 And earth her robe of green

 And ice upon the glancing stream
 Has cast its sombre shade
 And distant hills and valleys seem
 In frozen mist arrayed

 The Bluebell cannot charm me now
 The heath has lost its bloom
 The violets in the glen below
 They yield no sweet perfume

 But though I mourn the sweet Bluebell
 Tis better far away
 I know how fast my tears would swell
 To see it smile today

 For oh when chill the sunbeams fall
 Adown that dreary sky
 And gild yon dank and darkened wall
 With transient brilliancy

 How do I weep how do I pine
 For the time of flowers to come
 And turn me from that fading shine
 To mourn the fields of home




III

 Loud without the wind was roaring
 Through thautumnal sky
 Drenching wet the cold rain pouring
 Spoke of winter nigh
 All too like that dreary eve
 Did my exiled spirit grieve
 Grieved at first but grieved not long
 Sweethow softly sweetit came
 Wild words of an ancient song
 Undefined without a name

 It was spring and the skylark was singing
 Those words they awakened a spell
 They unlocked a deep fountain whose springing
 Nor absence nor distance can quell

 In the gloom of a cloudy November
 They uttered the music of May
 They kindled the perishing ember
 Into fervour that could not decay

 Awaken oer all my dear moorland
 Westwind in thy glory and pride
 Oh call me from valley and lowland
 To walk by the hilltorrents side

 It is swelled with the first snowy weather
 The rocks they are icy and hoar
 And sullenly waves the long heather
 And the fern leaves are sunny no more

 There are no yellow stars on the mountain
 The bluebells have long died away
 From the brink of the mossbedded fountain
 From the side of the wintry brae

 But lovelier than cornfields all waving
 In emerald and vermeil and gold
 Are the heights where the northwind is raving
 And the crags where I wandered of old

 It was morning the bright sun was beaming
 How sweetly it brought back to me
 The time when nor labour nor dreaming
 Broke the sleep of the happy and free

 But blithely we rose as the dawnheaven
 Was melting to amber and blue
 And swift were the wings to our feet given
 As we traversed the meadows of dew

 For the moors For the moors where the short grass
 Like velvet beneath us should lie
 For the moors For the moors where each high pass
 Rose sunny against the clear sky

 For the moors where the linnet was trilling
 Its song on the old granite stone
 Where the lark the wild skylark was filling
 Every breast with delight like its own

 What language can utter the feeling
 Which rose when in exile afar
 On the brow of a lonely hill kneeling
 I saw the brown heath growing there

 It was scattered and stunted and told me
 That soon even that would be gone
 It whispered The grim walls enfold me
 I have bloomed in my last summers sun

 But not the loved music whose waking
 Makes the soul of the Swiss die away
 Has a spell more adored and heartbreaking
 Than for me in that blighted heath lay

 The spirit which bent neath its power
 How it longedhow it burned to be free
 If I could have wept in that hour
 Those tears had been heaven to me

 Wellwell the sad minutes are moving
 Though loaded with trouble and pain
 And some time the loved and the loving
 Shall meet on the mountains again


The following little piece has no title but in it the Genius of a
solitary region seems to address his wandering and wayward votary and
to recall within his influence the proud mind which rebelled at times
even against what it most loved


 Shall earth no more inspire thee
 Thou lonely dreamer now
 Since passion may not fire thee
 Shall nature cease to bow

 Thy mind is ever moving
 In regions dark to thee
 Recall its useless roving
 Come back and dwell with me

 I know my mountain breezes
 Enchant and soothe thee still
 I know my sunshine pleases
 Despite thy wayward will

 When day with evening blending
 Sinks from the summer sky
 Ive seen thy spirit bending
 In fond idolatry

 Ive watched thee every hour
 I know my mighty sway
 I know my magic power
 To drive thy griefs away

 Few hearts to mortals given
 On earth so wildly pine
 Yet few would ask a heaven
 More like this earth than thine

 Then let my winds caress thee
 Thy comrade let me be
 Since nought beside can bless thee
 Returnand dwell with me


Here again is the same mind in converse with a like abstraction The
NightWind breathing through an open window has visited an ear which
discerned language in its whispers




THE NIGHTWIND

 In summers mellow midnight
 A cloudless moon shone through
 Our open parlour window
 And rosetrees wet with dew

 I sat in silent musing
 The soft wind waved my hair
 It told me heaven was glorious
 And sleeping earth was fair

 I needed not its breathing
 To bring such thoughts to me
 But still it whispered lowly
 How dark the woods will be

 The thick leaves in my murmur
 Are rustling like a dream
 And all their myriad voices
 Instinct with spirit seem

 I said Go gentle singer
 Thy wooing voice is kind
 But do not think its music
 Has power to reach my mind

 Play with the scented flower
 The young trees supple bough
 And leave my human feelings
 In their own course to flow

 The wanderer would not heed me
 Its kiss grew warmer still
 O come it sighed so sweetly
 Ill win thee gainst thy will

 Were we not friends from childhood
 Have I not loved thee long
 As long as thou the solemn night
 Whose silence wakes my song

 And when thy heart is resting
 Beneath the churchaisle stone
 I shall have time for mourning
 And THOU for being alone


In these stanzas a louder gale has roused the sleeper on her pillow the
wakened soul struggles to blend with the storm by which it is swayed


 Aythere it is it wakes tonight
 Deep feelings I thought dead
 Strong in the blastquick gathering light
 The hearts flame kindles red

 Now I can tell by thine altered cheek
 And by thine eyes full gaze
 And by the words thou scarce dost speak
 How wildly fancy plays

 YesI could swear that glorious wind
 Has swept the world aside
 Has dashed its memory from thy mind
 Like foambells from the tide

 And thou art now a spirit pouring
 Thy presence into all
 The thunder of the tempests roaring
 The whisper of its fall

 An universal influence
 From thine own influence free
 A principle of lifeintense
 Lost to mortality

 Thus truly when that breast is cold
 Thy prisoned soul shall rise
 The dungeon mingle with the mould
 The captive with the skies
 Natures deep being thine shall hold
 Her spirit all thy spirit fold
 Her breath absorb thy sighs
 Mortal though soon lifes tale is told
 Who once lives never dies




LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP

 Love is like the wild rosebriar
 Friendship like the hollytree
 The holly is dark when the rosebriar blooms
 But which will bloom most constantly

 The wild rosebriar is sweet in spring
 Its summer blossoms scent the air
 Yet wait till winter comes again
 And who will call the wildbriar fair

 Then scorn the silly rosewreath now
 And deck thee with the hollys sheen
 That when December blights thy brow
 He still may leave thy garland green




THE ELDERS REBUKE

 Listen When your hair like mine
 Takes a tint of silver gray
 When your eyes with dimmer shine
 Watch lifes bubbles float away

 When you young man have borne like me
 The weary weight of sixtythree
 Then shall penance sore be paid
 For those hours so wildly squandered
 And the words that now fall dead
 On your ear be deeply pondered
 Pondered and approved at last
 But their virtue will be past

 Glorious is the prize of Duty
 Though she be a serious power
 Treacherous all the lures of Beauty
 Thorny bud and poisonous flower

 Mirth is but a mad beguiling
 Of the goldengifted time
 Lovea demonmeteor wiling
 Heedless feet to gulfs of crime

 Those who follow earthly pleasure
 Heavenly knowledge will not lead
 Wisdom hides from them her treasure
 Virtue bids them evilspeed

 Vainly may their hearts repenting
 Seek for aid in future years
 Wisdom scorned knows no relenting
 Virtue is not won by fears

 Thus spake the iceblooded elder gray
 The young man scoffed as he turned away
 Turned to the call of a sweet lutes measure
 Waked by the lightsome touch of pleasure
 Had he neer met a gentler teacher
 Woe had been wrought by that pitiless preacher




THE WANDERER FROM THE FOLD

 How few of all the hearts that loved
 Are grieving for thee now
 And why should mine tonight be moved
 With such a sense of woe

 Too often thus when left alone
 Where none my thoughts can see
 Comes back a word a passing tone
 From thy strange history

 Sometimes I seem to see thee rise
 A glorious child again
 All virtues beaming from thine eyes
 That ever honoured men

 Courage and truth a generous breast
 Where sinless sunshine lay
 A being whose very presence blest
 Like gladsome summerday

 O fairly spread thy early sail
 And fresh and pure and free
 Was the first impulse of the gale
 Which urged lifes wave for thee

 Why did the pilot too confiding
 Dream oer that oceans foam
 And trust in Pleasures careless guiding
 To bring his vessel home

 For well he knew what dangers frowned
 What mists would gather dim
 What rocks and shelves and sands lay round
 Between his port and him

 The very brightness of the sun
 The splendour of the main
 The wind which bore him wildly on
 Should not have warned in vain

 An anxious gazer from the shore
 I marked the whitening wave
 And wept above thy fate the more
 BecauseI could not save

 It recks not now when all is over
 But yet my heart will be
 A mourner still though friend and lover
 Have both forgotten thee




WARNING AND REPLY

 In the earththe earththou shalt be laid
 A grey stone standing over thee
 Black mould beneath thee spread
 And black mould to cover thee

 Wellthere is rest there
 So fast come thy prophecy
 The time when my sunny hair
 Shall with grass roots entwined be

 But coldcold is that restingplace
 Shut out from joy and liberty
 And all who loved thy living face
 Will shrink from it shudderingly

 Not so HERE the world is chill
 And sworn friends fall from me
 But THEREthey will own me still
 And prize my memory

 Farewell then all that love
 All that deep sympathy
 Sleep on Heaven laughs above
 Earth never misses thee

 Turfsod and tombstone drear
 Part human company
 One heart breaks onlyhere
 But that heart was worthy thee




LAST WORDS

 I knew not twas so dire a crime
 To say the word Adieu
 But this shall be the only time
 My lips or heart shall sue

 That wild hillside the winter morn
 The gnarled and ancient tree
 If in your breast they waken scorn
 Shall wake the same in me

 I can forget black eyes and brows
 And lips of falsest charm
 If you forget the sacred vows
 Those faithless lips could form

 If hard commands can tame your love
 Or strongest walls can hold
 I would not wish to grieve above
 A thing so false and cold

 And there are bosoms bound to mine
 With links both tried and strong
 And there are eyes whose lightning shine
 Has warmed and blest me long

 Those eyes shall make my only day
 Shall set my spirit free
 And chase the foolish thoughts away
 That mourn your memory




THE LADY TO HER GUITAR

 For him who struck thy foreign string
 I ween this heart has ceased to care
 Then why dost thou such feelings bring
 To my sad spiritold Guitar

 It is as if the warm sunlight
 In some deep glen should lingering stay
 When clouds of storm or shades of night
 Have wrapt the parent orb away

 It is as if the glassy brook
 Should image still its willows fair
 Though years ago the woodmans stroke
 Laid low in dust their Dryadhair

 Even so Guitar thy magic tone
 Hath moved the tear and waked the sigh
 Hath bid the ancient torrent moan
 Although its very source is dry




THE TWO CHILDREN

 Heavy hangs the raindrop
 From the burdened spray
 Heavy broods the damp mist
 On uplands far away

 Heavy looms the dull sky
 Heavy rolls the sea
 And heavy throbs the young heart
 Beneath that lonely tree

 Never has a blue streak
 Cleft the clouds since morn
 Never has his grim fate
 Smiled since he was born

 Frowning on the infant
 Shadowing childhoods joy
 Guardianangel knows not
 That melancholy boy

 Day is passing swiftly
 Its sad and sombre prime
 Boyhood sad is merging
 In sadder manhoods time

 All the flowers are praying
 For sun before they close
 And he prays toounconscious
 That sunless human rose

 Blossomthat the westwind
 Has never wooed to blow
 Scentless are thy petals
 Thy dew is cold as snow

 Soulwhere kindred kindness
 No early promise woke
 Barren is thy beauty
 As weed upon a rock

 Withersoul and blossom
 You both were vainly given
 Earth reserves no blessing
 For the unblest of heaven

 Child of delight with sunbright hair
 And seablue seadeep eyes
 Spirit of bliss What brings thee here
 Beneath these sullen skies

 Thou shouldst live in eternal spring
 Where endless day is never dim
 Why Seraph has thine erring wing
 Wafted thee down to weep with him

 Ah not from heaven am I descended
 Nor do I come to mingle tears
 But sweet is day though with shadows blended
 And though clouded sweet are youthful years

 Ithe image of light and gladness
 Saw and pitied that mournful boy
 And I vowedif need wereto share his sadness
 And give to him my sunny joy

 Heavy and dark the night is closing
 Heavy and dark may its biding be
 Better for all from grief reposing
 And better for all who watch like me

 Watch in love by a fevered pillow
 Cooling the fever with pitys balm
 Safe as the petrel on tossing billow
 Safe in mine own souls golden calm

 Guardianangel he lacks no longer
 Evil fortune he need not fear
 Fate is strong but love is stronger
 And MY love is truer than angelcare




THE VISIONARY

 Silent is the house all are laid asleep
 One alone looks out oer the snowwreaths deep
 Watching every cloud dreading every breeze
 That whirls the wildering drift and bends the groaning trees

 Cheerful is the hearth soft the matted floor
 Not one shivering gust creeps through pane or door
 The little lamp burns straight its rays shoot strong and far
 I trim it well to be the wanderers guidingstar

 Frown my haughty sire chide my angry dame
 Set your slaves to spy threaten me with shame
 But neither sire nor dame nor prying serf shall know
 What angel nightly tracks that waste of frozen snow

 What I love shall come like visitant of air
 Safe in secret power from lurking human snare
 What loves me no word of mine shall eer betray
 Though for faith unstained my life must forfeit pay

 Burn then little lamp glimmer straight and clear
 Hush a rustling wing stirs methinks the air
 He for whom I wait thus ever comes to me
 Strange Power I trust thy might trust thou my constancy




ENCOURAGEMENT

 I do not weep I would not weep
 Our mother needs no tears
 Dry thine eyes too tis vain to keep
 This causeless grief for years

 What though her brow be changed and cold
 Her sweet eyes closed for ever
 What though the stonethe darksome mould
 Our mortal bodies sever

 What though her hand smooth neer again
 Those silken locks of thine
 Nor through long hours of future pain
 Her kind face oer thee shine

 Remember still she is not dead
 She sees us sister now
 Laid where her angel spirit fled
 Mid heath and frozen snow

 And from that world of heavenly light
 Will she not always bend
 To guide us in our lifetimes night
 And guard us to the end

 Thou knowest she will and thou mayst mourn
 That WE are left below
 But not that she can neer return
 To share our earthly woe




STANZAS

 Often rebuked yet always back returning
 To those first feelings that were born with me
 And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning
 For idle dreams of things which cannot be

 Today I will seek not the shadowy region
 Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear
 And visions rising legion after legion
 Bring the unreal world too strangely near

 Ill walk but not in old heroic traces
 And not in paths of high morality
 And not among the halfdistinguished faces
 The clouded forms of longpast history

 Ill walk where my own nature would be leading
 It vexes me to choose another guide
 Where the grey flocks in ferny glens are feeding
 Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side

 What have those lonely mountains worth revealing
 More glory and more grief than I can tell
 The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling
 Can centre both the worlds of Heaven and Hell




The following are the last lines my sister Emily ever wrote


 No coward soul is mine
 No trembler in the worlds stormtroubled sphere
 I see Heavens glories shine
 And faith shines equal arming me from fear

 O God within my breast
 Almighty everpresent Deity
 Lifethat in me has rest
 As Iundying Lifehave power in thee

 Vain are the thousand creeds
 That move mens hearts unutterably vain
 Worthless as withered weeds
 Or idlest froth amid the boundless main

 To waken doubt in one
 Holding so fast by thine infinity
 So surely anchored on
 The stedfast rock of immortality

 With wideembracing love
 Thy spirit animates eternal years
 Pervades and broods above
 Changes sustains dissolves creates and rears

 Though earth and man were gone
 And suns and universes ceased to be
 And Thou were left alone
 Every existence would exist in Thee

 There is not room for Death
 Nor atom that his might could render void
 ThouTHOU art Being and Breath
 And what THOU art may never be destroyed







SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ACTON BELL

In looking over my sister Annes papers I find mournful evidence that
religious feeling had been to her but too much like what it was to
Cowper I mean of course in a far milder form Without rendering her a
prey to those horrors that defy concealment it subdued her mood and
bearing to a perpetual pensiveness the pillar of a cloud glided
constantly before her eyes she ever waited at the foot of a secret
Sinai listening in her heart to the voice of a trumpet sounding long
and waxing louder Some perhaps would rejoice over these tokens of
sincere though sorrowing piety in a deceased relative I own to me they
seem sad as if her whole innocent life had been passed under the
martyrdom of an unconfessed physical pain their effect indeed would
be too distressing were it not combated by the certain knowledge that
in her last moments this tyranny of a too tender conscience was
overcome this pomp of terrors broke up and passing away left her
dying hour unclouded Her belief in God did not then bring to her dread
as of a stern Judgebut hope as in a Creator and Saviour and no
faltering hope was it but a sure and stedfast conviction on which in
the rude passage from Time to Eternity she threw the weight of her
human weakness and by which she was enabled to bear what was to be
borne patientlyserenelyvictoriously




DESPONDENCY

 I have gone backward in the work
 The labour has not sped
 Drowsy and dark my spirit lies
 Heavy and dull as lead

 How can I rouse my sinking soul
 From such a lethargy
 How can I break these iron chains
 And set my spirit free

 There have been times when I have mourned
 In anguish oer the past
 And raised my suppliant hands on high
 While tears fell thick and fast

 And prayed to have my sins forgiven
 With such a fervent zeal
 An earnest grief a strong desire
 As now I cannot feel

 And I have felt so full of love
 So strong in spirit then
 As if my heart would never cool
 Or wander back again

 And yet alas how many times
 My feet have gone astray
 How oft have I forgot my God
 How greatly fallen away

 My sins increasemy love grows cold
 And Hope within me dies
 Even Faith itself is wavering now
 Oh how shall I arise

 I cannot weep but I can pray
 Then let me not despair
 Lord Jesus save me lest I die
 Christ hear my humble prayer




A PRAYER

 My God oh let me call Thee mine
 Weak wretched sinner though I be
 My trembling soul would fain be Thine
 My feeble faith still clings to Thee

 Not only for the Past I grieve
 The Future fills me with dismay
 Unless Thou hasten to relieve
 Thy suppliant is a castaway

 I cannot say my faith is strong
 I dare not hope my love is great
 But strength and love to Thee belong
 Oh do not leave me desolate

 I know I owe my all to Thee
 Oh TAKE the heart I cannot give
 Do Thou my strengthmy Saviour be
 And MAKE me to Thy glory live




IN MEMORY OF A HAPPY DAY IN FEBRUARY

 Blessed be Thou for all the joy
 My soul has felt today
 Oh let its memory stay with me
 And never pass away

 I was alone for those I loved
 Were far away from me
 The sun shone on the withered grass
 The wind blew fresh and free

 Was it the smile of early spring
 That made my bosom glow
 Twas sweet but neither sun nor wind
 Could cheer my spirit so

 Was it some feeling of delight
 All vague and undefined
 No twas a rapture deep and strong
 Expanding in the mind

 Was it a sanguine view of life
 And all its transient bliss
 A hope of bright prosperity
 Oh no it was not this

 It was a glimpse of truth divine
 Unto my spirit given
 Illumined by a ray of light
 That shone direct from heaven

 I felt there was a God on high
 By whom all things were made
 I saw His wisdom and His power
 In all his works displayed

 But most throughout the moral world
 I saw his glory shine
 I saw His wisdom infinite
 His mercy all divine

 Deep secrets of His providence
 In darkness long concealed
 Unto the vision of my soul
 Were graciously revealed

 But while I wondered and adored
 His Majesty divine
 I did not tremble at His power
 I felt that God was mine

 I knew that my Redeemer lived
 I did not fear to die
 Full sure that I should rise again
 To immortality

 I longed to view that bliss divine
 Which eye hath never seen
 Like Moses I would see His face
 Without the veil between




CONFIDENCE

 Oppressed with sin and woe
 A burdened heart I bear
 Opposed by many a mighty foe
 But I will not despair

 With this polluted heart
 I dare to come to Thee
 Holy and mighty as Thou art
 For Thou wilt pardon me

 I feel that I am weak
 And prone to every sin
 But Thou who givst to those who seek
 Wilt give me strength within

 Far as this earth may be
 From yonder starry skies
 Remoter still am I from Thee
 Yet Thou wilt not despise

 I need not fear my foes
 I deed not yield to care
 I need not sink beneath my woes
 For Thou wilt answer prayer

 In my Redeemers name
 I give myself to Thee
 And all unworthy as I am
 My God will cherish me


My sister Anne had to taste the cup of life as it is mixed for the class
termed Governesses

The following are some of the thoughts that now and then solace a
governess




LINES WRITTEN FROM HOME

 Though bleak these woods and damp the ground
 With fallen leaves so thickly strewn
 And cold the wind that wanders round
 With wild and melancholy moan

 There is a friendly roof I know
 Might shield me from the wintry blast
 There is a fire whose ruddy glow
 Will cheer me for my wanderings past

 And so though still whereer I go
 Cold stranger glances meet my eye
 Though when my spirit sinks in woe
 Unheeded swells the unbidden sigh

 Though solitude endured too long
 Bids youthful joys too soon decay
 Makes mirth a stranger to my tongue
 And overclouds my noon of day

 When kindly thoughts that would have way
 Flow back discouraged to my breast
 I know there is though far away
 A home where heart and soul may rest

 Warm hands are there that clasped in mine
 The warmer heart will not belie
 While mirth and truth and friendship shine
 In smiling lip and earnest eye

 The ice that gathers round my heart
 May there be thawed and sweetly then
 The joys of youth that now depart
 Will come to cheer my soul again

 Though far I roam that thought shall be
 My hope my comfort everywhere
 While such a home remains to me
 My heart shall never know despair




THE NARROW WAY

 Believe not those who say
 The upward path is smooth
 Lest thou shouldst stumble in the way
 And faint before the truth

 It is the only road
 Unto the realms of joy
 But he who seeks that blest abode
 Must all his powers employ

 Bright hopes and pure delight
 Upon his course may beam
 And there amid the sternest heights
 The sweetest flowerets gleam

 On all her breezes borne
 Earth yields no scents like those
 But he that dares not gasp the thorn
 Should never crave the rose

 Armarm thee for the fight
 Cast useless loads away
 Watch through the darkest hours of night
 Toil through the hottest day

 Crush pride into the dust
 Or thou must needs be slack
 And trample down rebellious lust
 Or it will hold thee back

 Seek not thy honour here
 Waive pleasure and renown
 The worlds dread scoff undaunted bear
 And face its deadliest frown

 To labour and to love
 To pardon and endure
 To lift thy heart to God above
 And keep thy conscience pure

 Be this thy constant aim
 Thy hope thy chief delight
 What matter who should whisper blame
 Or who should scorn or slight

 What matter if thy God approve
 And if within thy breast
 Thou feel the comfort of His love
 The earnest of His rest




DOMESTIC PEACE

 Why should such gloomy silence reign
 And why is all the house so drear
 When neither danger sickness pain
 Nor death nor want have entered here

 We are as many as we were
 That other night when all were gay
 And full of hope and free from care
 Yet is there something gone away

 The moon without as pure and calm
 Is shining as that night she shone
 But now to us she brings no balm
 For something from our hearts is gone

 Something whose absence leaves a void
 A cheerless want in every heart
 Each feels the bliss of all destroyed
 And mourns the changebut each apart

 The fire is burning in the grate
 As redly as it used to burn
 But still the hearth is desolate
 Till mirth and love and PEACE return

 Twas PEACE that flowed from heart to heart
 With looks and smiles that spoke of heaven
 And gave us language to impart
 The blissful thoughts itself had given

 Domestic peace best joy of earth
 When shall we all thy value learn
 White angel to our sorrowing hearth
 Returnoh graciously return




THE THREE GUIDES First published in FRASERS MAGAZINE

 Spirit of Earth thy hand is chill
 Ive felt its icy clasp
 And shuddering I remember still
 That stonyhearted grasp
 Thine eye bids love and joy depart
 Oh turn its gaze from me
 It presses down my shrinking heart
 I will not walk with thee

 Wisdom is mine Ive heard thee say
 Beneath my searching eye
 All mist and darkness melt away
 Phantoms and fables fly
 Before me truth can stand alone
 The naked solid truth
 And man matured by worth will own
 If I am shunned by youth

 Firm is my tread and sure though slow
 My footsteps never slide
 And he that follows me shall know
 I am the surest guide
 Thy boast is vain but were it true
 That thou couldst safely steer
 Lifes rough and devious pathway through
 Such guidance I should fear

 How could I bear to walk for aye
 With eyes to earthward prone
 Oer trampled weeds and miry clay
 And sand and flinty stone
 Never the glorious view to greet
 Of hill and dale and sky
 To see that Natures charms are sweet
 Or feel that Heaven is nigh

 If in my heart arose a spring
 A gush of thought divine
 At once stagnation thou wouldst bring
 With that cold touch of thine
 If glancing up I sought to snatch
 But one glimpse of the sky
 My baffled gaze would only catch
 Thy heartless cold grey eye

 If to the breezes wandering near
 I listened eagerly
 And deemed an angels tongue to hear
 That whispered hope to me
 That heavenly music would be drowned
 In thy harsh droning voice
 Nor inward thought nor sight nor sound
 Might my sad soul rejoice

 Dull is thine ear unheard by thee
 The still small voice of Heaven
 Thine eyes are dim and cannot see
 The helps that God has given
 There is a bridge oer every flood
 Which thou canst not perceive
 A path through every tangled wood
 But thou wilt not believe

 Striving to make thy way by force
 Toilspent and brambletorn
 Thoult fell the tree that checks thy course
 And burst through brier and thorn
 And pausing by the rivers side
 Poor reasoner thou wilt deem
 By casting pebbles in its tide
 To cross the swelling stream

 Right through the flinty rock thoult try
 Thy toilsome way to bore
 Regardless of the pathway nigh
 That would conduct thee oer
 Not only art thou then unkind
 And freezing cold to me
 But unbelieving deaf and blind
 I will not walk with thee

 Spirit of Pride thy wings are strong
 Thine eyes like lightning shine
 Ecstatic joys to thee belong
 And powers almost divine
 But tis a false destructive blaze
 Within those eyes I see
 Turn hence their fascinating gaze
 I will not follow thee

 Coward and fool thou mayst reply
 Walk on the common sod
 Go trace with timid foot and eye
 The steps by others trod
 Tis best the beaten path to keep
 The ancient faith to hold
 To pasture with thy fellowsheep
 And lie within the fold

 Cling to the earth poor grovelling worm
 Tis not for thee to soar
 Against the fury of the storm
 Amid the thunders roar
 Theres glory in that daring strife
 Unknown undreamt by thee
 Theres speechless rapture in the life
 Of those who follow me

 Yes I have seen thy votaries oft
 Upheld by thee their guide
 In strength and courage mount aloft
 The steepy mountainside
 Ive seen them stand against the sky
 And gazing from below
 Beheld thy lightning in their eye
 Thy triumph on their brow

 Oh I have felt what glory then
 What transport must be theirs
 So far above their fellowmen
 Above their toils and cares
 Inhaling Natures purest breath
 Her riches round them spread
 The wide expanse of earth beneath
 Heavens glories overhead

 But I have seen them helpless dashd
 Down to a bloody grave
 And still thy ruthless eye has flashd
 Thy strong hand did not save
 Ive seen some oer the mountains brow
 Sustaind awhile by thee
 Oer rocks of ice and hills of snow
 Bound fearless wild and free

 Bold and exultant was their mien
 While thou didst cheer them on
 But evening felland then I ween
 Their faithless guide was gone
 Alas how fared thy favourites then
 Lone helpless weary cold
 Did ever wanderer find again
 The path he left of old

 Where is their glory where the pride
 That swelled their hearts before
 Where now the courage that defied
 The mightiest tempests roar
 What shall they do when night grows black
 When angry storms arise
 Who now will lead them to the track
 Thou taughtst them to despise

 Spirit of Pride it needs not this
 To make me shun thy wiles
 Renounce thy triumph and thy bliss
 Thy honours and thy smiles
 Bright as thou art and bold and strong
 That fierce glance wins not me
 And I abhor thy scoffing tongue
 I will not follow thee

 Spirit of Faith be thou my guide
 O clasp my hand in thine
 And let me never quit thy side
 Thy comforts are divine
 Earth calls thee blind misguided one
 But who can shew like thee
 Forgotten things that have been done
 And things that are to be

 Secrets conceald from Natures ken
 Who like thee can declare
 Or who like thee to erring men
 Gods holy will can bear
 Pride scorns thee for thy lowly mien
 But who like thee can rise
 Above this toilsome sordid scene
 Beyond the holy skies

 Meek is thine eye and soft thy voice
 But wondrous is thy might
 To make the wretched soul rejoice
 To give the simple light
 And still to all that seek thy way
 This magic power is given
 Een while their footsteps press the clay
 Their souls ascend to heaven

 Danger surrounds thempain and woe
 Their portion here must be
 But only they that trust thee know
 What comfort dwells with thee
 Strength to sustain their drooping powrs
 And vigour to defend
 Thou polestar of my darkest hours
 Afflictions firmest friend

 Day does not always mark our way
 Nights shadows oft appal
 But lead me and I cannot stray
 Hold me I shall not fall
 Sustain me I shall never faint
 How rough soeer may be
 My upward roadnor moan nor plaint
 Shall mar my trust in thee

 Narrow the path by which we go
 And oft it turns aside
 From pleasant meads where roses blow
 And peaceful waters glide
 Where flowery turf lies green and soft
 And gentle gales are sweet
 To where dark mountains frown aloft
 Hard rocks distress the feet

 Deserts beyond lie bleak and bare
 And keen winds round us blow
 But if thy hand conducts me there
 The way is right I know
 I have no wish to turn away
 My spirit does not quail
 How can it while I hear thee say
 Press forward and prevail

 Even above the tempests swell
 I hear thy voice of love
 Of hope and peace I hear thee tell
 And that blest home above
 Through pain and death I can rejoice
 If but thy strength be mine
 Earth hath no music like thy voice
 Life owns no joy like thine

 Spirit of Faith Ill go with thee
 Thou if I hold thee fast
 Wilt guide defend and strengthen me
 And bear me home at last
 By thy help all things I can do
 In thy strength all things bear
 Teach me for thou art just and true
 Smile on me thou art fair


I have given the last memento of my sister Emily this is the last of my
sister Anne


 I hoped that with the brave and strong
 My portioned task might lie
 To toil amid the busy throng
 With purpose pure and high

 But God has fixed another part
 And He has fixed it well
 I said so with my bleeding heart
 When first the anguish fell

 Thou God hast taken our delight
 Our treasured hope away
 Thou bidst us now weep through the night
 And sorrow through the day

 These weary hours will not be lost
 These days of misery
 These nights of darkness anguishtost
 Can I but turn to Thee

 With secret labour to sustain
 In humble patience every blow
 To gather fortitude from pain
 And hope and holiness from woe

 Thus let me serve Thee from my heart
 Whateer may be my written fate
 Whether thus early to depart
 Or yet a while to wait

 If Thou shouldst bring me back to life
 More humbled I should be
 More wisemore strengthened for the strife
 More apt to lean on Thee

 Should death be standing at the gate
 Thus should I keep my vow
 But Lord whatever be my fate
 Oh let me serve Thee now


These lines written the desk was closed the pen laid asidefor ever
