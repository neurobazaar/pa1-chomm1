BROOKSMITH


We are scattered now the friends of the late Mr Oliver Offord but
whenever we chance to meet I think we are conscious of a certain
esoteric respect for each other Yes you too have been in Arcadia we
seem not too grumpily to allow When I pass the house in Mansfield
Street I remember that Arcadia was there I dont know who has it now
and dont want to know its enough to be so sure that if I should ring
the bell there would be no such luck for me as that Brooksmith should
open the door Mr Offord the most agreeable the most attaching of
bachelors was a retired diplomatist living on his pension and on
something of his own over and above a good deal confined by his
infirmities to his fireside and delighted to be found there any
afternoon in the year from five oclock on by such visitors as
Brooksmith allowed to come up Brooksmith was his butler and his most
intimate friend to whom we all stood or I should say sat in the same
relation in which the subject of the sovereign finds himself to the
prime minister By having been for years in foreign lands the most
delightful Englishman any one had ever known Mr Offord had in my
opinion rendered signal service to his country But I suppose he had
been too much likedliked even by those who didnt like ITso that as
people of that sort never get titles or dotations for the horrid things
theyve NOT done his principal reward was simply that we went to see
him

Oh we went perpetually and it was not our fault if he was not
overwhelmed with this particular honour Any visitor who came once came
again to come merely once was a slight nobody Im sure had ever put
upon him His circle therefore was essentially composed of habitues who
were habitues for each other as well as for him as those of a happy
salon should be I remember vividly every element of the place down to
the intensely Londonish look of the grey opposite houses in the gap of
the white curtains of the high windows and the exact spot where on a
particular afternoon I put down my teacup for Brooksmith lingering an
instant to gather it up as if he were plucking a flower Mr Offords
drawingroom was indeed Brooksmiths garden his pruned and tended human
parterre and if we all flourished there and grew well in our places it
was largely owing to his supervision

Many persons have heard much though most have doubtless seen little of
the famous institution of the salon and many are born to the depression
of knowing that this finest flower of social life refuses to bloom where
the English tongue is spoken The explanation is usually that our women
have not the skill to cultivate itthe art to direct through a smiling
land between suggestive shores a sinuous stream of talk My
affectionate my pious memory of Mr Offord contradicts this induction
only I fear more insidiously to confirm it The sallow and slightly
smoked drawingroom in which he spent so large a portion of the last
years of his life certainly deserved the distinguished name but on the
other hand it couldnt be said at all to owe its stamp to any
intervention throwing into relief the fact that there was no Mrs
Offord The dear man had indeed at the most been capable of one of
those sacrifices to which women are deemed peculiarly apt he had
recognisedunder the influence in some degree it is true of physical
infirmitythat if you wish people to find you at home you must manage
not to be out He had in short accepted the truth which many dabblers in
the social art are slow to learn that you must really as they say
take a line and that the only way as yet discovered of being at home is
to stay at home Finally his own fireside had become a summary of his
habits Why should he ever have left itsince this would have been
leaving what was notoriously pleasantest in London the compact charmed
cluster thinning away indeed into casual couples round the fine old
lastcentury chimneypiece which with the exception of the remarkable
collection of miniatures was the best thing the place contained Mr
Offord wasnt rich he had nothing but his pension and the use for life
of the somewhat superannuated house

When Im reminded by some opposed discomfort of the present hour how
perfectly we were all handled there I ask myself once more what had
been the secret of such perfection One had taken it for granted at the
time for anything that is supremely good produces more acceptance than
surprise I felt we were all happy but I didnt consider how our
happiness was managed And yet there were questions to be asked
questions that strike me as singularly obvious now that theres nobody
to answer them Mr Offord had solved the insoluble he had without
feminine helpsave in the sense that ladies were dying to come to him
and that he saved the lives of severalestablished a salon but I might
have guessed that there was a method in his madness a law in his
success He hadnt hit it off by a mere fluke There was an art in it
all and how was the art so hidden Who indeed if it came to that was
the occult artist Launching this inquiry the other day I had already
got hold of the tail of my reply I was helped by the very wonder of
some of the conditions that came back to methose that used to seem as
natural as sunshine in a fine climate

How was it for instance that we never were a crowd never either too
many or too few always the right people WITH the right peoplethere
must really have been no wrong people at allalways coming and going
never sticking fast nor overstaying yet never popping in or out with an
indecorous familiarity How was it that we all sat where we wanted and
moved when we wanted and met whom we wanted and escaped whom we wanted
joining according to the accident of inclination the general circle or
falling in with a single talker on a convenient sofa Why were all the
sofas so convenient the accidents so happy the talkers so ready the
listeners so willing the subjects presented to you in a rotation as
quickly foreordained as the courses at dinner A dearth of topics would
have been as unheard of as a lapse in the service These speculations
couldnt fail to lead me to the fundamental truth that Brooksmith had
been somehow at the bottom of the mystery If he hadnt established the
salon at least he had carried it on Brooksmith in short was the artist

We felt this covertly at the time without formulating it and were
conscious as an ordered and prosperous community of his evenhanded
justice all untainted with flunkeyism He had none of that
vulgarityhis touch was infinitely fine The delicacy of it was clear
to me on the first occasion my eyes rested as they were so often to
rest again on the domestic revealed in the turbid light of the street
by the opening of the housedoor I saw on the spot that though he had
plenty of school he carried it without arrogancehe had remained
articulate and human LEcole Anglaise Mr Offord used laughingly to
call him when later on it happened more than once that we had some
conversation about him But I remember accusing Mr Offord of not doing
him quite ideal justice That he wasnt one of the giants of the school
however was admitted by my old friend who really understood him
perfectly and was devoted to him as I shall show which doubtless poor
Brooksmith had himself felt to his cost when his value in the market
was originally determined The utility of his class in general is
estimated by the foot and the inch and poor Brooksmith had only about
five feet three to put into circulation He acknowledged the inadequacy
of this provision and Im sure was penetrated with the everlasting
fitness of the relation between service and stature If HE had been Mr
Offord he certainly would have found Brooksmith wanting and indeed the
laxity of his employer on this score was one of many things he had had
to condone and to which he had at last indulgently adapted himself

I remember the old mans saying to me Oh my servants if they can live
with me a fortnight they can live with me for ever But its the first
fortnight that tries em It was in the first fortnight for instance
that Brooksmith had had to learn that he was exposed to being addressed
as my dear fellow and my poor child Strange and deep must such a
probation have been to him and he doubtless emerged from it tempered
and purified This was written to a certain extent in his appearance in
his spare brisk little person in his cloistered white face and
extraordinarily polished hair which told of responsibility looked as
if it were kept up to the same high standard as the plate in his small
clear anxious eyes even in the permitted though not exactly
encouraged tuft on his chin He thinks me rather mad but Ive broken
him in and now he likes the place he likes the company said the old
man I embraced this fully after I had become aware that Brooksmiths
main characteristic was a deep and shy refinement though I remember I
was rather puzzled when on another occasion Mr Offord remarked What
he likes is the talkmingling in the conversation I was conscious I
had never seen Brooksmith permit himself this freedom but I guessed in
a moment that what Mr Offord alluded to was a participation more
intense than any speech could have representedthat of being
perpetually present on a hundred legitimate pretexts errands
necessities and breathing the very atmosphere of criticism the famous
criticism of life Quite an education sir isnt it sir he said to
me one day at the foot of the stairs when he was letting me out and
Ive always remembered the words and the tone as the first sign of the
quickening drama of poor Brooksmiths fate It was indeed an education
but to what was this sensitive young man of thirtyfive of the servile
class being educated

Practically and inevitably for the time to companionship to the
perpetual the even exaggerated reference and appeal of a person brought
to dependence by his time of life and his infirmities and always
addicted moreoverthis was the exaggerationto the art of giving you
pleasure by letting you do things for him There were certain things Mr
Offord was capable of pretending he liked you to do even when he
didntthis I mean if he thought YOU liked them If it happened that
you didnt eitherwhich was rare yet might beof course there were
crosspurposes but Brooksmith was there to prevent their going very
far This was precisely the way he acted as moderator he averted
misunderstandings or cleared them up He had been capable strange as it
may appear of acquiring for this purpose an insight into the French
tongue which was often used at Mr Offords for besides being habitual
to most of the foreigners and they were many who haunted the place or
arrived with lettersletters often requiring a little worried
consideration of which Brooksmith always had cognisanceit had really
become the primary language of the master of the house I dont know if
all the malentendus were in French but almost all the explanations
were and this didnt a bit prevent Brooksmiths following them I know
Mr Offord used to read passages to him from Montaigne and SaintSimon
for he read perpetually when alonewhen THEY were alone that isand
Brooksmith was always about Perhaps youll say no wonder Mr Offords
butler regarded him as rather mad However if Im not sure what he
thought about Montaigne Im convinced he admired SaintSimon A certain
feeling for letters must have rubbed off on him from the mere handling
of his masters books which he was always carrying to and fro and
putting back in their places

I often noticed that if an anecdote or a quotation much more a lively
discussion was going forward he would if busy with the fire or the
curtains the lamp or the tea find a pretext for remaining in the room
till the point should be reached If his purpose was to catch it you
werent discreet you were in fact scarce human to call him off and I
shall never forget a look a hard stony stareI caught it in its
passagewhich one day when there were a good many people in the room
he fastened upon the footman who was helping him in the service and who
in an undertone had asked him some irrelevant question It was the only
manifestation of harshness I ever observed on Brooksmiths part and I
at first wondered what was the matter Then I became conscious that Mr
Offord was relating a very curious anecdote never before perhaps made
so public and imparted to the narrator by an eyewitness of the fact
bearing on Lord Byrons life in Italy Nothing would induce me to
reproduce it here but Brooksmith had been in danger of losing it If I
ever should venture to reproduce it I shall feel how much I lose in not
having my fellow auditor to refer to

The first day Mr Offords door was closed was therefore a dark date in
contemporary history It was raining hard and my umbrella was wet but
Brooksmith received it from me exactly as if this were a preliminary for
going upstairs I observed however that instead of putting it away he
held it poised and trickling over the rug and I then became aware that
he was looking at me with deep acknowledging eyeshis air of universal
responsibility I immediately understoodthere was scarce need of
question and answer as they passed between us When I took in that our
good friend had given up as never before though only for the occasion
I exclaimed dolefully What a difference it will makeand to how many
people

I shall be one of them sir said Brooksmith and that was the
beginning of the end

Mr Offord came down again but the spell was broken the great sign
being that the conversation was for the first time not directed It
wandered and stumbled a little frightened like a lost childit had
let go the nurses hand The worst of it is that now we shall talk
about my healthCEST LA FIN DE TOUT Mr Offord said when he
reappeared and then I recognised what a note of change that would
befor he had never tolerated anything so provincial We ran to each
others health as little as to the daily weather The talk became ours
in a wordnot his and as ours even when HE talked it could only be
inferior In this form it was a distress to Brooksmith whose attention
now wandered from it altogether he had so much closer a vision of his
masters intimate conditions than our superficialities represented
There were better hours and he was more in and out of the room but I
could see he was conscious of the decline almost of the collapse of
our great institution He seemed to wish to take counsel with me about
it to feel responsible for its going on in some form or other When for
the second periodthe first had lasted several dayshe had to tell me
that his employer didnt receive I half expected to hear him say after
a moment Do you think I ought to sir in his placeas he might have
asked me with the return of autumn if I thought he had better light
the drawingroom fire

He had a resigned philosophic sense of what his guestsour guests as I
came to regard them in our colloquieswould expect His feeling was
that he wouldnt absolutely have approved of himself as a substitute for
Mr Offord but he was so saturated with the religion of habit that he
would have made for our friends the necessary sacrifice to the
divinity He would take them on a little further till they could look
about them I think I saw him also mentally confronted with the
opportunity to dealfor once in his lifewith some of his own dumb
preferences his limitations of sympathy WEEDING a little in prospect
and returning to a purer tradition It was not unknown to me that he
considered that toward the end of our hosts career a certain laxity of
selection had crept in

At last it came to be the case that we all found the closed door more
often than the open one but even when it was closed Brooksmith managed
a crack for me to squeeze through so that practically I never turned
away without having paid a visit The difference simply came to be that
the visit was to Brooksmith It took place in the hall at the familiar
foot of the stairs and we didnt sit down at least Brooksmith didnt
moreover it was devoted wholly to one topic and always had the air of
being already overbeginning so to say at the end But it was always
interestingit always gave me something to think about Its true that
the subject of my meditation was ever the sameever Its all very
well but what WILL become of Brooksmith Even my private answer to
this question left me still unsatisfied No doubt Mr Offord would
provide for him but WHAT would he providethat was the great point
He couldnt provide society and society had become a necessity of
Brooksmiths nature I must add that he never showed a symptom of what I
may call sordid solicitudeanxiety on his own account He was rather
livid and intensely grave as befitted a man before whose eyes the
shade of that which once was great was passing away He had the
solemnity of a person winding up under depressing circumstances a
longestablished and celebrated business he was a kind of social
executor or liquidator But his manner seemed to testify exclusively to
the uncertainty of OUR future I couldnt in those days have afforded
itI lived in two rooms in Jermyn Street and didnt keep a man but
even if my income had permitted I shouldnt have ventured to say to
Brooksmith emulating Mr Offord My dear fellow Ill take you on
The whole tone of our intercourse was so much more an implication that
it was I who should now want a lift Indeed there was a tacit assurance
in Brooksmiths whole attitude that he should have me on his mind

One of the most assiduous members of our circle had been Lady Kenyon
and I remember his telling me one day that her ladyship had in spite of
her own infirmities lately much aggravated been in person to inquire
In answer to this I remarked that she would feel it more than any one
Brooksmith had a pause before saying in a certain tonetheres no
reproducing some of his tonesIll go and see her I went to see her
myself and learned he had waited on her but when I said to her in the
form of a joke but with a core of earnest that when all was over some
of us ought to combine to club together and set Brooksmith up on his
own account she replied a trifle disappointingly Do you mean in a
publichouse I looked at her in a way that I think Brooksmith himself
would have approved and then I answered Yes the Offord Arms What I
had meant of course was that for the love of art itself we ought to look
to it that such a peculiar faculty and so much acquired experience
shouldnt be wasted I really think that if we had caused a few
blackedged cards to be struck off and circulatedMr Brooksmith will
continue to receive on the old premises from four to seven business
carried on as usual during the alterationsthe greater number of us
would have rallied

Several times he took me upstairsalways by his own proposaland our
dear old friend in bed in a curious flowered and brocaded casaque
which made him especially as his head was tied up in a handkerchief to
match look to my imagination like the dying Voltaire held for ten
minutes a sadly shrunken little salon I felt indeed each time as if I
were attending the last coucher of some social sovereign He was royally
whimsical about his sufferings and not at all concernedquite as if the
Constitution provided for the case about his successor He glided over
OUR sufferings charmingly and none of his jokesit was a gallant
abstention some of them would have been so easywere at our expense
Now and again I confess there was one at Brooksmiths but so
pathetically sociable as to make the excellent man look at me in a way
that seemed to say Do exchange a glance with me or I shant be able
to stand it What he wasnt able to stand was not what Mr Offord said
about him but what he wasnt able to say in return His idea of
conversation for himself was giving you the convenience of speaking to
him and when he went to see Lady Kenyon for instance it was to carry
her the tribute of his receptive silence Where would the speech of his
betters have been if proper service had been a manifestation of sound
In that case the fundamental difference would have had to be shown by
their dumbness and many of them poor things were dumb enough without
that provision Brooksmith took an unfailing interest in the
preservation of the fundamental difference it was the thing he had most
on his conscience

What had become of it however when Mr Offord passed away like any
inferior personwas relegated to eternal stillness after the manner of
a butler abovestairs His aspect on the eventfor the several
successive daysmay be imagined and the multiplication by funereal
observance of the things he didnt say When everything was overit was
late the same dayI knocked at the door of the house of mourning as I
so often had done before I could never call on Mr Offord again but I
had come literally to call on Brooksmith I wanted to ask him if there
was anything I could do for him tainted with vagueness as this inquiry
could only be My presumptuous dream of taking him into my own service
had died away my service wasnt worth his being taken into My offer
could only be to help him to find another place and yet there was an
indelicacy as it were in taking for granted that his thoughts would
immediately be fixed on another I had a hope that he would be able to
give his life a different formthough certainly not the form the
frequent result of such bereavements of his setting up a little shop
That would have been dreadful for I should have wished to forward any
enterprise he might embark in yet how could I have brought myself to go
and pay him shillings and take back coppers over a counter My visit
then was simply an intended compliment He took it as such gratefully
and with all the tact in the world He knew I really couldnt help him
and that I knew he knew I couldnt but we discussed the situationwith
a good deal of elegant generalityat the foot of the stairs in the
hall already dismantled where I had so often discussed other situations
with him The executors were in possession as was still more apparent
when he made me pass for a few minutes into the diningroom where
various objects were muffled up for removal

Two definite facts however he had to communicate one being that he
was to leave the house for ever that night servants for some
mysterious reason seem always to depart by night and the otherhe
mentioned it only at the last and with hesitationthat he was already
aware his late master had left him a legacy of eighty pounds Im very
glad I said and Brooksmith was of the same mind It was so like him
to think of me This was all that passed between us on the subject and
I know nothing of his judgement of Mr Offords memento Eighty pounds
are always eighty pounds and no one has ever left ME an equal sum but
all the same for Brooksmith I was disappointed I dont know what I
had expected but it was almost a shock Eighty pounds might stock a
small shopa VERY small shop but I repeat I couldnt bear to think
of that I asked my friend if he had been able to save a little and he
replied No sir Ive had to do things I didnt inquire what things
they might have been they were his own affair and I took his word for
them as assentingly as if he had had the greatness of an ancient house
to keep up especially as there was something in his manner that seemed
to convey a prospect of further sacrifice

I shall have to turn round a bit sirI shall have to look about me
he said and then he added indulgently magnanimously If you should
happen to hear of anything for me

I couldnt let him finish this was in its essence too much in the
really grand manner It would be a help to my getting him off my mind to
be able to pretend I COULD find the right place and that help he wished
to give me for it was doubtless painful to him to see me in so false a
position I interposed with a few words to the effect of how well aware
I was that wherever he should go whatever he should do he would miss
our old friend terriblymiss him even more than I should having been
with him so much more This led him to make the speech that has remained
with me as the very text of the whole episode

Oh sir its sad for YOU very sad indeed and for a great many
gentlemen and ladies that it is sir But for me sir it is if I may
say so still graver even than that its just the loss of something
that was everything For me sir he went on with rising tears he was
just ALL if you know what I mean sir You have others sir I
daresaynot that I would have you understand me to speak of them as in
any way tantamount But you have the pleasures of society sir if its
only in talking about him sir as I daresay you do freelyfor all his
blest memory has to fear from itwith gentlemen and ladies who have had
the same honour Thats not for me sir and Ive to keep my
associations to myself Mr Offord was MY society and now you see I
just havent any You go back to conversation sir after all and I go
back to my place Brooksmith stammered without exaggerated irony or
dramatic bitterness but with a flat unstudied veracity and his hand on
the knob of the streetdoor He turned it to let me out and then he
added I just go downstairs sir again and I stay there

My poor child I replied in my emotion quite as Mr Offord used to
speak my dear fellow leave it to me WELL look after you well all
do something for you

Ah if you could give me some one LIKE him But there aint two such in
the world Brooksmith said as we parted

He had given me his addressthe place where he would be to be heard of
For a long time I had no occasion to make use of the information he
proved on trial so very difficult a case The people who knew him and
had known Mr Offord didnt want to take him and yet I couldnt bear to
try to thrust him among strangersstrangers to his past when not to his
present I spoke to many of our old friends about him and found them all
governed by the odd mixture of feelings of which I myself was
consciousas well as disposed further to entertain a suspicion that
he was spoiled with which I then would have nothing to do In plain
terms a certain embarrassment a sensible awkwardness when they thought
of it attached to the idea of using him as a menial they had met him
so often in society Many of them would have asked him and did ask him
or rather did ask me to ask him to come and see them but a mere
visitinglist was not what I wanted for him He was too short for people
who were very particular nevertheless I heard of an opening in a
diplomatic household which led me to write him a note though I was
looking much less for something grand than for something human Five
days later I heard from him The secretarys wife had decided after
keeping him waiting till then that she couldnt take a servant out of a
house in which there hadnt been a lady The note had a PS Its a
good job there wasnt sir such a lady as some

A week later he came to see me and told me he was suited committed to
some highly respectable peoplethey were something quite immense in the
Citywho lived on the Bayswater side of the Park I daresay it will be
rather poor sir he admitted but Ive seen the fireworks havent I
sirit cant be fireworks EVERY night After Mansfield Street there
aint much choice There was a certain amount however it seemed for
the following year calling one day on a country cousin a lady of a
certain age who was spending a fortnight in town with some friends of
her own a family unknown to me and resident in Chester Square the door
of the house was opened to my surprise and gratification by Brooksmith
in person When I came out I had some conversation with him from which I
gathered that he had found the large City people too dull for endurance
and I guessed though he didnt say it that he had found them vulgar as
well I dont know what judgement he would have passed on his actual
patrons if my relative hadnt been their friend but in view of that
connexion he abstained from comment

None was necessary however for before the lady in question brought her
visit to a close they honoured me with an invitation to dinner which I
accepted There was a largeish party on the occasion but I confess I
thought of Brooksmith rather more than of the seated company They
required no depth of attentionthey were all referable to usual
irredeemable inevitable types It was the world of cheerful commonplace
and conscious gentility and prosperous density a fullfed material
insular world a world of hideous florid plate and ponderous order and
thin conversation There wasnt a word said about Byron or even about a
minor bard then much in view Nothing would have induced me to look at
Brooksmith in the course of the repast and I felt sure that not even my
overturning the wine would have induced him to meet my eye We were in
intellectual sympathywe felt as regards each other a degree of
social responsibility In short we had been in Arcadia together and we
had both come to THIS No wonder we were ashamed to be confronted When
he had helped on my overcoat as I was going away we parted for the
first time since the earliest days of Mansfield Street in silence I
thought he looked lean and wasted and I guessed that his new place
wasnt more human than his previous one There was plenty of beef and
beer but there was no reciprocity The question for him to have asked
before accepting the position wouldnt have been How many footmen are
kept but How much imagination

The next time I went to the houseI confess it wasnt very soonI
encountered his successor a personage who evidently enjoyed the good
fortune of never having quitted his natural level Could any be higher
he seemed to askover the heads of three footmen and even of some
visitors He made me feel as if Brooksmith were dead but I didnt dare
to inquireI couldnt have borne his I havent the least idea sir I
despatched a note to the address that worthy had given me after Mr
Offords death but I received no answer Six months later however I was
favoured with a visit from an elderly dreary dingy person who introduced
herself to me as Mr Brooksmiths aunt and from whom I learned that he
was out of place and out of health and had allowed her to come and say
to me that if I could spare half an hour to look in at him he would take
it as a rare honour

I went the next dayhis messenger had given me a new addressand found
my friend lodged in a short sordid street in Marylebone one of those
corners of London that wear the last expression of sickly meanness The
room into which I was shown was above the small establishment of a dyer
and cleaner who had inflated kid gloves and discoloured shawls in his
shopfront There was a great deal of grimy infant life up and down the
place and there was a hot moist smell within as of the boiling of
dirty linen Brooksmith sat with a blanket over his legs at a clean
little window where from behind stiff bluishwhite curtains he could
look across at a hucksters and a tinsmiths and a small greasy
publichouse He had passed through an illness and was convalescent and
his mother as well as his aunt was in attendance on him I liked the
nearer relative who was bland and intensely humble but I had my doubts
of the remoter whom I connected perhaps unjustly with the opposite
publichouseshe seemed somehow greasy with the same greaseand whose
furtive eye followed every movement of my hand as to see if it werent
going into my pocket It didnt take this directionI couldnt
unsolicited put myself at that sort of ease with Brooksmith Several
times the door of the room opened and mysterious old women peeped in and
shuffled back again I dont know who they were poor Brooksmith seemed
encompassed with vague prying beery females

He was vague himself and evidently weak and much embarrassed and not
an allusion was made between us to Mansfield Street The vision of the
salon of which he had been an ornament hovered before me however by
contrast sufficiently He assured me he was really getting better and
his mother remarked that he would come round if he could only get his
spirits up The aunt echoed this opinion and I became more sure that in
her own case she knew where to go for such a purpose Im afraid I was
rather weak with my old friend for I neglected the opportunity so
exceptionally good to rebuke the levity which had led him to throw up
honourable positionsfine stiff steady berths in Bayswater and
Belgravia with morning prayers as I knew attached to one of them
Very likely his reasons had been profane and sentimental he didnt want
morning prayers he wanted to be somebodys dear fellow but I couldnt
be the person to rebuke him He shuffled these episodes out of sightI
saw he had no wish to discuss them I noted further strangely enough
that it would probably be a questionable pleasure for him to see me
again he doubted now even of my power to condone his aberrations He
didnt wish to have to explain and his behaviour was likely in future
to need explanation When I bade him farewell he looked at me a moment
with eyes that said everything How can I talk about those exquisite
years in this place before these people with the old women poking
their heads in It was very good of you to come to see me it wasnt my
ideaSHE brought you Weve said everything its over youll lose all
patience with me and Id rather you shouldnt see the rest I sent him
some money in a letter the next day but I saw the rest only in the
light of a barren sequel

A whole year after my visit to him I became aware once in dining out
that Brooksmith was one of the several servants who hovered behind our
chairs He hadnt opened the door of the house to me nor had I
recognised him in the array of retainers in the hall This time I tried
to catch his eye but he never gave me a chance and when he handed me a
dish I could only be careful to thank him audibly Indeed I partook of
two ENTREES of which I had my doubts subsequently converted into
certainties in order not to snub him He looked well enough in health
but much older and wore in an exceptionally marked degree the glazed
and expressionless mask of the British domestic DE RACE I saw with
dismay that if I hadnt known him I should have taken him on the
showing of his countenance for an extravagant illustration of
irresponsive servile gloom I said to myself that he had become a
reactionary gone over to the Philistines thrown himself into religion
the religion of his place like a foreign lady SUR LE RETOUR I
divined moreover that he was only engaged for the eveninghe had become
a mere waiter had joined the band of the whitewaistcoated who go
out There was something pathetic in this factit was a terrible
vulgarisation of Brooksmith It was the mercenary prose of butlerhood
he had given up the struggle for the poetry If reciprocity was what he
had missed where was the reciprocity now Only in the bottoms of the
wineglasses and the five shillingsor whatever they getclapped into
his hand by the permanent man However I supposed he had taken up a
precarious branch of his profession because it after all sent him less
downstairs His relations with London society were more superficial but
they were of course more various As I went away on this occasion I
looked out for him eagerly among the four or five attendants whose
perpendicular persons fluting the walls of London passages are
supposed to lubricate the process of departure but he was not on duty
I asked one of the others if he were not in the house and received the
prompt answer Just left sir Anything I can do for you sir I
wanted to say Please give him my kind regards but I abstainedI
didnt want to compromise him and I never came across him again

Often and often in dining out I looked for him sometimes accepting
invitations on purpose to multiply the chances of my meeting him But
always in vain so that as I met many other members of the casual class
over and over again I at last adopted the theory that he always procured
a list of expected guests beforehand and kept away from the banquets
which he thus learned I was to grace At last I gave up hope and one
day at the end of three years I received another visit from his aunt
She was drearier and dingier almost squalid and she was in great
tribulation and want Her sister Mrs Brooksmith had been dead a year
and three months later her nephew had disappeared He had always looked
after her a bit since her troubles I never knew what her troubles had
beenand now she hadnt so much as a petticoat to pawn She had also a
niece to whom she had been everything before her troubles but the
niece had treated her most shameful These were details the great and
romantic fact was Brooksmiths final evasion of his fate He had gone
out to wait one evening as usual in a white waistcoat she had done up
for him with her own handsbeing due at a large party up Kensington
way But he had never come home again and had never arrived at the large
party nor at any party that any one could make out No trace of him had
come to lightno gleam of the white waistcoat had pierced the obscurity
of his doom This news was a sharp shock to me for I had my ideas about
his real destination His aged relative had promptly as she said
guessed the worst Somehow and somewhere he had got out of the way
altogether and now I trust that with characteristic deliberation he
is changing the plates of the immortal gods As my depressing visitant
also said he never HAD got his spirits up I was fortunately able to
dismiss her with her own somewhat improved But the dim ghost of poor
Brooksmith is one of those that I see He had indeed been spoiled




THE REAL THING




CHAPTER I


When the porters wife who used to answer the housebell announced A
gentleman and a lady sir I had as I often had in those daysthe
wish being father to the thoughtan immediate vision of sitters
Sitters my visitors in this case proved to be but not in the sense I
should have preferred There was nothing at first however to indicate
that they mightnt have come for a portrait The gentleman a man of
fifty very high and very straight with a moustache slightly grizzled
and a dark grey walkingcoat admirably fitted both of which I noted
professionallyI dont mean as a barber or yet as a tailorwould have
struck me as a celebrity if celebrities often were striking It was a
truth of which I had for some time been conscious that a figure with a
good deal of frontage was as one might say almost never a public
institution A glance at the lady helped to remind me of this
paradoxical law she also looked too distinguished to be a
personality Moreover one would scarcely come across two variations
together

Neither of the pair immediately spokethey only prolonged the
preliminary gaze suggesting that each wished to give the other a chance
They were visibly shy they stood there letting me take them inwhich
as I afterwards perceived was the most practical thing they could have
done In this way their embarrassment served their cause I had seen
people painfully reluctant to mention that they desired anything so
gross as to be represented on canvas but the scruples of my new friends
appeared almost insurmountable Yet the gentleman might have said I
should like a portrait of my wife and the lady might have said I
should like a portrait of my husband Perhaps they werent husband and
wifethis naturally would make the matter more delicate Perhaps they
wished to be done togetherin which case they ought to have brought a
third person to break the news

We come from Mr Rivet the lady finally said with a dim smile that
had the effect of a moist sponge passed over a sunk piece of painting
as well as of a vague allusion to vanished beauty She was as tall and
straight in her degree as her companion and with ten years less to
carry She looked as sad as a woman could look whose face was not
charged with expression that is her tinted oval mask showed waste as an
exposed surface shows friction The hand of time had played over her
freely but to an effect of elimination She was slim and stiff and so
welldressed in dark blue cloth with lappets and pockets and buttons
that it was clear she employed the same tailor as her husband The
couple had an indefinable air of prosperous thriftthey evidently got a
good deal of luxury for their money If I was to be one of their
luxuries it would behove me to consider my terms

Ah Claude Rivet recommended me I echoed and I added that it was very
kind of him though I could reflect that as he only painted landscape
this wasnt a sacrifice

The lady looked very hard at the gentleman and the gentleman looked
round the room Then staring at the floor a moment and stroking his
moustache he rested his pleasant eyes on me with the remark He said
you were the right one

I try to be when people want to sit

Yes we should like to said the lady anxiously

Do you mean together

My visitors exchanged a glance If you could do anything with ME I
suppose it would be double the gentleman stammered

Oh yes theres naturally a higher charge for two figures than for
one

We should like to make it pay the husband confessed

Thats very good of you I returned appreciating so unwonted a
sympathyfor I supposed he meant pay the artist

A sense of strangeness seemed to dawn on the lady We mean for the
illustrationsMr Rivet said you might put one in

Put inan illustration I was equally confused

Sketch her off you know said the gentleman colouring

It was only then that I understood the service Claude Rivet had rendered
me he had told them how I worked in blackandwhite for magazines for
storybooks for sketches of contemporary life and consequently had
copious employment for models These things were true but it was not
less trueI may confess it now whether because the aspiration was to
lead to everything or to nothing I leave the reader to guessthat I
couldnt get the honours to say nothing of the emoluments of a great
painter of portraits out of my head My illustrations were my
potboilers I looked to a different branch of artfar and away the
most interesting it had always seemed to meto perpetuate my fame
There was no shame in looking to it also to make my fortune but that
fortune was by so much further from being made from the moment my
visitors wished to be done for nothing I was disappointed for in the
pictorial sense I had immediately SEEN them I had seized their typeI
had already settled what I would do with it Something that wouldnt
absolutely have pleased them I afterwards reflected

Ah youreyourea I began as soon as I had mastered my surprise
I couldnt bring out the dingy word models it seemed so little to fit
the case

We havent had much practice said the lady

Weve got to do something and weve thought that an artist in your
line might perhaps make something of us her husband threw off He
further mentioned that they didnt know many artists and that they had
gone first on the offchancehe painted views of course but sometimes
put in figures perhaps I rememberedto Mr Rivet whom they had met a
few years before at a place in Norfolk where he was sketching

We used to sketch a little ourselves the lady hinted

Its very awkward but we absolutely must do something her husband
went on

Of course were not so VERY young she admitted with a wan smile

With the remark that I might as well know something more about them the
husband had handed me a card extracted from a neat new
pocketbooktheir appurtenances were all of the freshestand inscribed
with the words Major Monarch Impressive as these words were they
didnt carry my knowledge much further but my visitor presently added
Ive left the army and weve had the misfortune to lose our money In
fact our means are dreadfully small

Its awfully tryinga regular strain said Mrs Monarch

They evidently wished to be discreetto take care not to swagger
because they were gentlefolk I felt them willing to recognise this as
something of a drawback at the same time that I guessed at an
underlying sensetheir consolation in adversitythat they HAD their
points They certainly had but these advantages struck me as
preponderantly social such for instance as would help to make a
drawingroom look well However a drawingroom was always or ought to
be a picture

In consequence of his wifes allusion to their age Major Monarch
observed Naturally its more for the figure that we thought of going
in We can still hold ourselves up On the instant I saw that the
figure was indeed their strong point His naturally didnt sound vain
but it lighted up the question SHE has the best one he continued
nodding at his wife with a pleasant afterdinner absence of
circumlocution I could only reply as if we were in fact sitting over
our wine that this didnt prevent his own from being very good which
led him in turn to make answer We thought that if you ever have to do
people like us we might be something like it SHE particularlyfor a
lady in a book you know

I was so amused by them that to get more of it I did my best to take
their point of view and though it was an embarrassment to find myself
appraising physically as if they were animals on hire or useful blacks
a pair whom I should have expected to meet only in one of the relations
in which criticism is tacit I looked at Mrs Monarch judicially enough
to be able to exclaim after a moment with conviction Oh yes a lady in
a book She was singularly like a bad illustration

Well stand up if you like said the Major and he raised himself
before me with a really grand air

I could take his measure at a glancehe was six feet two and a perfect
gentleman It would have paid any club in process of formation and in
want of a stamp to engage him at a salary to stand in the principal
window What struck me at once was that in coming to me they had rather
missed their vocation they could surely have been turned to better
account for advertising purposes I couldnt of course see the thing in
detail but I could see them make somebodys fortuneI dont mean their
own There was something in them for a waistcoatmaker an hotelkeeper
or a soapvendor I could imagine We always use it pinned on their
bosoms with the greatest effect I had a vision of the brilliancy with
which they would launch a table dhote

Mrs Monarch sat still not from pride but from shyness and presently
her husband said to her Get up my dear and show how smart you are
She obeyed but she had no need to get up to show it She walked to the
end of the studio and then came back blushing her fluttered eyes on the
partner of her appeal I was reminded of an incident I had accidentally
had a glimpse of in Parisbeing with a friend there a dramatist about
to produce a play when an actress came to him to ask to be entrusted
with a part She went through her paces before him walked up and down
as Mrs Monarch was doing Mrs Monarch did it quite as well but I
abstained from applauding It was very odd to see such people apply for
such poor pay She looked as if she had ten thousand a year Her husband
had used the word that described her she was in the London current
jargon essentially and typically smart Her figure was in the same
order of ideas conspicuously and irreproachably good For a woman of
her age her waist was surprisingly small her elbow moreover had the
orthodox crook She held her head at the conventional angle but why did
she come to ME She ought to have tried on jackets at a big shop I
feared my visitors were not only destitute but artisticwhich would
be a great complication When she sat down again I thanked her
observing that what a draughtsman most valued in his model was the
faculty of keeping quiet

Oh SHE can keep quiet said Major Monarch Then he added jocosely
Ive always kept her quiet

Im not a nasty fidget am I It was going to wring tears from me I
felt the way she hid her head ostrichlike in the other broad bosom

The owner of this expanse addressed his answer to me Perhaps it isnt
out of place to mentionbecause we ought to be quite businesslike
oughtnt wethat when I married her she was known as the Beautiful
Statue

Oh dear said Mrs Monarch ruefully

Of course I should want a certain amount of expression I rejoined

Of COURSEand I had never heard such unanimity

And then I suppose you know that youll get awfully tired

Oh we NEVER get tired they eagerly cried

Have you had any kind of practice

They hesitatedthey looked at each other Weve been
photographedIMMENSELY said Mrs Monarch

She means the fellows have asked us themselves added the Major

I seebecause youre so goodlooking

I dont know what they thought but they were always after us

We always got our photographs for nothing smiled Mrs Monarch

We might have brought some my dear her husband remarked

Im not sure we have any left Weve given quantities away she
explained to me

With our autographs and that sort of thing said the Major

Are they to be got in the shops I inquired as a harmless pleasantry

Oh yes HERSthey used to be

Not now said Mrs Monarch with her eyes on the floor




CHAPTER II


I could fancy the sort of thing they put on the presentation copies of
their photographs and I was sure they wrote a beautiful hand It was
odd how quickly I was sure of everything that concerned them If they
were now so poor as to have to cam shillings and pence they could never
have had much of a margin Their good looks had been their capital and
they had goodhumouredly made the most of the career that this resource
marked out for them It was in their faces the blankness the deep
intellectual repose of the twenty years of countryhouse visiting that
had given them pleasant intonations I could see the sunny
drawingrooms sprinkled with periodicals she didnt read in which Mrs
Monarch had continuously sat I could see the wet shrubberies in which
she had walked equipped to admiration for either exercise I could see
the rich covers the Major had helped to shoot and the wonderful garments
in which late at night he repaired to the smokingroom to talk about
them I could imagine their leggings and waterproofs their knowing
tweeds and rugs their rolls of sticks and cases of tackle and neat
umbrellas and I could evoke the exact appearance of their servants and
the compact variety of their luggage on the platforms of country
stations

They gave small tips but they were liked they didnt do anything
themselves but they were welcome They looked so well everywhere they
gratified the general relish for stature complexion and form They
knew it without fatuity or vulgarity and they respected themselves in
consequence They werent superficial they were thorough and kept
themselves upit had been their line People with such a taste for
activity had to have some line I could feel how even in a dull house
they could have been counted on for the joy of life At present
something had happenedit didnt matter what their little income had
grown less it had grown leastand they had to do something for
pocketmoney Their friends could like them I made out without liking
to support them There was something about them that represented
credittheir clothes their manners their type but if credit is a
large empty pocket in which an occasional chink reverberates the chink
at least must be audible What they wanted of me was help to make it so
Fortunately they had no childrenI soon divined that They would also
perhaps wish our relations to be kept secret this was why it was for
the figurethe reproduction of the face would betray them

I liked themI felt quite as their friends must have donethey were
so simple and I had no objection to them if they would suit But
somehow with all their perfections I didnt easily believe in them
After all they were amateurs and the ruling passion of my life wasthe
detestation of the amateur Combined with this was another
perversityan innate preference for the represented subject over the
real one the defect of the real one was so apt to be a lack of
representation I liked things that appeared then one was sure Whether
they WERE or not was a subordinate and almost always a profitless
question There were other considerations the first of which was that I
already had two or three recruits in use notably a young person with
big feet in alpaca from Kilburn who for a couple of years had come to
me regularly for my illustrations and with whom I was stillperhaps
ignoblysatisfied I frankly explained to my visitors how the case
stood but they had taken more precautions than I supposed They had
reasoned out their opportunity for Claude Rivet had told them of the
projected EDITION DE LUXE of one of the writers of our daythe rarest
of the novelistswho long neglected by the multitudinous vulgar and
dearly prized by the attentive need I mention Philip Vincent had had
the happy fortune of seeing late in life the dawn and then the full
light of a higher criticism an estimate in which on the part of the
public there was something really of expiation The edition preparing
planned by a publisher of taste was practically an act of high
reparation the woodcuts with which it was to be enriched were the
homage of English art to one of the most independent representatives of
English letters Major and Mrs Monarch confessed to me they had hoped I
might be able to work THEM into my branch of the enterprise They knew I
was to do the first of the books Rutland Ramsay but I had to make
clear to them that my participation in the rest of the affairthis
first book was to be a testmust depend on the satisfaction I should
give If this should be limited my employers would drop me with scarce
common forms It was therefore a crisis for me and naturally I was
making special preparations looking about for new people should they
be necessary and securing the best types I admitted however that I
should like to settle down to two or three good models who would do for
everything

Should we have often toaput on special clothes Mrs Monarch
timidly demanded

Dear yesthats half the business

And should we be expected to supply our own costumes

Oh no Ive got a lot of things A painters models put onor put
offanything he likes

And you meanathe same

The same

Mrs Monarch looked at her husband again

Oh she was just wondering he explained if the costumes are in
GENERAL use I had to confess that they were and I mentioned further
that some of themI had a lot of genuine greasy lastcentury
thingshad served their time a hundred years ago on living
worldstained men and women on figures not perhaps so far removed in
that vanished world from THEIR type the Monarchs QUOI of a breeched
and bewigged age Well put on anything that FITS said the Major

Oh I arrange thatthey fit in the pictures

Im afraid I should do better for the modern books Id come as you
like said Mrs Monarch

She has got a lot of clothes at home they might do for contemporary
life her husband continued

Oh I can fancy scenes in which youd be quite natural And indeed I
could see the slipshod rearrangements of stale propertiesthe stories
I tried to produce pictures for without the exasperation of reading
themwhose sandy tracts the good lady might help to people But I had
to return to the fact thatfor this sort of workthe daily mechanical
grindI was already equipped the people I was working with were fully
adequate

We only thought we might be more like SOME characters said Mrs
Monarch mildly getting up

Her husband also rose he stood looking at me with a dim wistfulness
that was touching in so fine a man Wouldnt it be rather a pull
sometimes to haveato have He hung fire he wanted me to help him
by phrasing what he meant But I couldntI didnt know So he brought
it out awkwardly The REAL thing a gentleman you know or a lady I
was quite ready to give a general assentI admitted that there was a
great deal in that This encouraged Major Monarch to say following up
his appeal with an unacted gulp Its awfully hardweve tried
everything The gulp was communicative it proved too much for his
wife Before I knew it Mrs Monarch had dropped again upon a divan and
burst into tears Her husband sat down beside her holding one of her
hands whereupon she quickly dried her eyes with the other while I felt
embarrassed as she looked up at me There isnt a confounded job I
havent applied forwaited forprayed for You can fancy wed be
pretty bad first Secretaryships and that sort of thing You might as
well ask for a peerage Id be ANYTHINGIm strong a messenger or a
coalheaver Id put on a goldlaced cap and open carriagedoors in front
of the haberdashers Id hang about a station to carry portmanteaux
Id be a postman But they wont LOOK at you there are thousands as
good as yourself already on the ground GENTLEMEN poor beggars whove
drunk their wine whove kept their hunters

I was as reassuring as I knew how to be and my visitors were presently
on their feet again while for the experiment we agreed on an hour We
were discussing it when the door opened and Miss Churm came in with a
wet umbrella Miss Churm had to take the omnibus to Maida Vale and then
walk half a mile She looked a trifle blowsy and slightly splashed I
scarcely ever saw her come in without thinking afresh how odd it was
that being so little in herself she should yet be so much in others
She was a meagre little Miss Churm but was such an ample heroine of
romance She was only a freckled cockney but she could represent
everything from a fine lady to a shepherdess she had the faculty as
she might have had a fine voice or long hair She couldnt spell and she
loved beer but she had two or three points and practice and a
knack and motherwit and a whimsical sensibility and a love of the
theatre and seven sistersand not an ounce of respect especially for
the H The first thing my visitors saw was that her umbrella was wet
and in their spotless perfection they visibly winced at it The rain had
come on since their arrival

Im all in a soak there WAS a mess of people in the bus I wish you
lived near a stytion said Miss Churm I requested her to get ready as
quickly as possible and she passed into the room in which she always
changed her dress But before going out she asked me what she was to get
into this time

Its the Russian princess dont you know I answered the one with
the golden eyes in black velvet for the long thing in the
CHEAPSIDE

Golden eyes I SAY cried Miss Churm while my companions watched her
with intensity as she withdrew She always arranged herself when she
was late before I could turn round and I kept my visitors a little on
purpose so that they might get an idea from seeing her what would be
expected of themselves I mentioned that she was quite my notion of an
excellent modelshe was really very clever

Do you think she looks like a Russian princess Major Monarch asked
with lurking alarm

When I make her yes

Oh if you have to MAKE her he reasoned not without point

Thats the most you can ask There are so many who are not makeable

Well now HERES a ladyand with a persuasive smile he passed his arm
into his wifeswhos already made

Oh Im not a Russian princess Mrs Monarch protested a little coldly
I could see she had known some and didnt like them There at once was a
complication of a kind I never had to fear with Miss Churm

This young lady came back in black velvetthe gown was rather rusty and
very low on her lean shouldersand with a Japanese fan in her red
hands I reminded her that in the scene I was doing she had to look over
some ones head I forget whose it is but it doesnt matter Just look
over a head

Id rather look over a stove said Miss Churm and she took her station
near the fire She fell into Position settled herself into a tall
attitude gave a certain backward inclination to her head and a certain
forward droop to her fan and looked at least to my prejudiced sense
distinguished and charming foreign and dangerous We left her looking
so while I went downstairs with Major and Mrs Monarch

I believe I could come about as near it as that said Mrs Monarch

Oh you think shes shabby but you must allow for the alchemy of art

However they went off with an evident increase of comfort founded on
their demonstrable advantage in being the real thing I could fancy them
shuddering over Miss Churm She was very droll about them when I went
back for I told her what they wanted

Well if SHE can sit Ill tyke to bookkeeping said my model

Shes very ladylike I replied as an innocent form of aggravation

So much the worse for YOU That means she cant turn round

Shell do for the fashionable novels

Oh yes shell DO for them my model humorously declared Aint they
bad enough without her I had often sociably denounced them to Miss
Churm




CHAPTER III


It was for the elucidation of a mystery in one of these works that I
first tried Mrs Monarch Her husband came with her to be useful if
necessaryit was sufficiently clear that as a general thing he would
prefer to come with her At first I wondered if this were for
proprietys sakeif he were going to be jealous and meddling The
idea was too tiresome and if it had been confirmed it would speedily
have brought our acquaintance to a close But I soon saw there was
nothing in it and that if he accompanied Mrs Monarch it wasin
addition to the chance of being wantedsimply because he had nothing
else to do When they were separate his occupation was gone and they
never HAD been separate I judged rightly that in their awkward
situation their close union was their main comfort and that this union
had no weak spot It was a real marriage an encouragement to the
hesitating a nut for pessimists to crack Their address was humbleI
remember afterwards thinking it had been the only thing about them that
was really professionaland I could fancy the lamentable lodgings in
which the Major would have been left alone He could sit there more or
less grimly with his wifehe couldnt sit there anyhow without her

He had too much tact to try and make himself agreeable when he couldnt
be useful so when I was too absorbed in my work to talk he simply sat
and waited But I liked to hear him talkit made my work when not
interrupting it less mechanical less special To listen to him was to
combine the excitement of going out with the economy of staying at home
There was only one hindrancethat I seemed not to know any of the
people this brilliant couple had known I think he wondered extremely
during the term of our intercourse whom the deuce I DID know He hadnt
a stray sixpence of an idea to fumble for so we didnt spin it very
fine we confined ourselves to questions of leather and even of
liquorsaddlers and breechesmakers and how to get excellent claret
cheapand matters like good trains and the habits of small game His
lore on these last subjects was astonishinghe managed to interweave
the stationmaster with the ornithologist When he couldnt talk about
greater things he could talk cheerfully about smaller and since I
couldnt accompany him into reminiscences of the fashionable world he
could lower the conversation without a visible effort to my level

So earnest a desire to please was touching in a man who could so easily
have knocked one down He looked after the fire and had an opinion on
the draught of the stove without my asking him and I could see that he
thought many of my arrangements not half knowing I remember telling him
that if I were only rich Id offer him a salary to come and teach me how
to live Sometimes he gave a random sigh of which the essence might have
been Give me even such a bare oldbarrack as this and Id do
something with it When I wanted to use him he came alone which was an
illustration of the superior courage of women His wife could bear her
solitary second floor and she was in general more discreet showing by
various small reserves that she was alive to the propriety of keeping
our relations markedly professionalnot letting them slide into
sociability She wished it to remain clear that she and the Major were
employed not cultivated and if she approved of me as a superior who
could be kept in his place she never thought me quite good enough for
an equal

She sat with great intensity giving the whole of her mind to it and
was capable of remaining for an hour almost as motionless as before a
photographers lens I could see she had been photographed often but
somehow the very habit that made her good for that purpose unfitted her
for mine At first I was extremely pleased with her ladylike air and it
was a satisfaction on coming to follow her lines to see how good they
were and how far they could lead the pencil But after a little
skirmishing I began to find her too insurmountably stiff do what I
would with it my drawing looked like a photograph or a copy of a
photograph Her figure had no variety of expressionshe herself had no
sense of variety You may say that this was my business and was only a
question of placing her Yet I placed her in every conceivable position
and she managed to obliterate their differences She was always a lady
certainly and into the bargain was always the same lady She was the
real thing but always the same thing There were moments when I rather
writhed under the serenity of her confidence that she WAS the real
thing All her dealings with me and all her husbands were an
implication that this was lucky for ME Meanwhile I found myself trying
to invent types that approached her own instead of making her own
transform itselfin the clever way that was not impossible for instance
to poor Miss Churm Arrange as I would and take the precautions I would
she always came out in my pictures too talllanding me in the dilemma
of having represented a fascinating woman as seven feet high which out
of respect perhaps to my own very much scantier inches was far from my
idea of such a personage

The case was worse with the Majornothing I could do would keep HIM
down so that he became useful only for the representation of brawny
giants I adored variety and range I cherished human accidents the
illustrative note I wanted to characterise closely and the thing in
the world I most hated was the danger of being ridden by a type I had
quarrelled with some of my friends about it I had parted company with
them for maintaining that one HAD to be and that if the type was
beautifulwitness Raphael and Leonardothe servitude was only a gain
I was neither Leonardo nor RaphaelI might only be a presumptuous young
modern searcher but I held that everything was to be sacrificed sooner
than character When they claimed that the obsessional form could easily
BE character I retorted perhaps superficially Whose It couldnt be
everybodysit might end in being nobodys

After I had drawn Mrs Monarch a dozen times I felt surer even than
before that the value of such a model as Miss Churm resided precisely in
the fact that she had no positive stamp combined of course with the
other fact that what she did have was a curious and inexplicable talent
for imitation Her usual appearance was like a curtain whichshe could
draw up at request for a capital performance This performance was
simply suggestive but it was a word to the wiseit was vivid and
pretty Sometimes even I thought it though she was plain herself too
insipidly pretty I made it a reproach to her that the figures drawn
from her were monotonously BETEMENT as we used to say graceful
Nothing made her more angry it was so much her pride to feel she could
sit for characters that had nothing in common with each other She would
accuse me at such moments of taking away her reputytion

It suffered a certain shrinkage this queer quantity from the repeated
visits of my new friends Miss Churm was greatly in demand never in
want of employment so I had no scruple in putting her off occasionally
to try them more at my ease It was certainly amusing at first to do the
real thingit was amusing to do Major Monarchs trousers They WERE the
real thing even if he did come out colossal It was amusing to do his
wifes back hairit was so mathematically neatand the particular
smart tension of her tight stays She lent herself especially to
positions in which the face was somewhat averted or blurred she
abounded in ladylike back views and PROFILS PERDUS When she stood erect
she took naturally one of the attitudes in which courtpainters
represent queens and princesses so that I found myself wondering
whether to draw out this accomplishment I couldnt get the editor of
the CHEAPSIDE to publish a really royal romance A Tale of Buckingham
Palace Sometimes however the real thing and the makebelieve came into
contact by which I mean that Miss Churm keeping an appointment or
coming to make one on days when I had much work in hand encountered her
invidious rivals The encounter was not on their part for they noticed
her no more than if she had been the housemaid not from intentional
loftiness but simply because as yet professionally they didnt know
how to fraternise as I could imagine they would have likedor at least
that the Major would They couldnt talk about the omnibusthey always
walked and they didnt know what else to tryshe wasnt interested in
good trains or cheap claret Besides they must have feltin the
airthat she was amused at them secretly derisive of their ever
knowing how She wasnt a person to conceal the limits of her faith if
she had had a chance to show them On the other hand Mrs Monarch didnt
think her tidy for why else did she take pains to say to meit was
going out of the way for Mrs Monarchthat she didnt like dirty
women

One day when my young lady happened to be present with my other
sittersshe even dropped in when it was convenient for a chatI
asked her to be so good as to lend a hand in getting tea a service with
which she was familiar and which was one of a class that living as I
did in a small way with slender domestic resources I often appealed to
my models to render They liked to lay hands on my property to break
the sitting and sometimes the chinait made them feel Bohemian The
next time I saw Miss Churm after this incident she surprised me greatly
by making a scene about itshe accused me of having wished to humiliate
her She hadnt resented the outrage at the time but had seemed
obliging and amused enjoying the comedy of asking Mrs Monarch who sat
vague and silent whether she would have cream and sugar and putting an
exaggerated simper into the question She had tried intonationsas if
she too wished to pass for the real thingtill I was afraid my other
visitors would take offence

Oh they were determined not to do this and their touching patience was
the measure of their great need They would sit by the hour
uncomplaining till I was ready to use them they would come back on the
chance of being wanted and would walk away cheerfully if it failed I
used to go to the door with them to see in what magnificent order they
retreated I tried to find other employment for themI introduced them
to several artists But they didnt take for reasons I could
appreciate and I became rather anxiously aware that after such
disappointments they fell back upon me with a heavier weight They did
me the honour to think me most their form They werent romantic enough
for the painters and in those days there were few serious workers in
blackandwhite

Besides they had an eye to the great job I had mentioned to themthey
had secretly set their hearts on supplying the right essence for my
pictorial vindication of our fine novelist They knew that for this
undertaking I should want no costumeeffects none of the frippery of
past agesthat it was a case in which everything would be contemporary
and satirical and presumably genteel If I could work them into it their
future would be assured for the labour would of course be long and the
occupation steady

One day Mrs Monarch came without her husbandshe explained his absence
by his having had to go to the City While she sat there in her usual
relaxed majesty there came at the door a knock which I immediately
recognised as the subdued appeal of a model out of work It was followed
by the entrance of a young man whom I at once saw to be a foreigner and
who proved in fact an Italian acquainted with no English word but my
name which he uttered in a way that made it seem to include all others
I hadnt then visited his country nor was I proficient in his tongue
but as he was not so meanly constitutedwhat Italian isas to depend
only on that member for expression he conveyed to me in familiar but
graceful mimicry that he was in search of exactly the employment in
which the lady before me was engaged I was not struck with him at
first and while I continued to draw I dropped few signs of interest or
encouragement He stood his ground howevernot importunately but with
a dumb doglike fidelity in his eyes that amounted to innocent
impudence the manner of a devoted servanthe might have been in the
house for yearsunjustly suspected Suddenly it struck me that this
very attitude and expression made a picture whereupon I told him to sit
down and wait till I should be free There was another picture in the
way he obeyed me and I observed as I worked that there were others
still in the way he looked wonderingly with his head thrown back about
the high studio He might have been crossing himself in Saint Peters
Before I finished I said to myself The fellows a bankrupt
orangemonger but a treasure

When Mrs Monarch withdrew he passed across the room like a flash to
open the door for her standing there with the rapt pure gaze of the
young Dante spellbound by the young Beatrice As I never insisted in
such situations on the blankness of the British domestic I reflected
that he had the making of a servantand I needed one but couldnt pay
him to be only thatas well as of a model in short I resolved to adopt
my bright adventurer if he would agree to officiate in the double
capacity He jumped at my offer and in the event my rashnessfor I had
really known nothing about himwasnt brought home to me He proved a
sympathetic though a desultory ministrant and had in a wonderful degree
the SENTIMENT DE LA POSE It was uncultivated instinctive a part of
the happy instinct that had guided him to my door and helped him to
spell out my name on the card nailed to it He had had no other
introduction to me than a guess from the shape of my high north window
seen outside that my place was a studio and that as a studio it would
contain an artist He had wandered to England in search of fortune like
other itinerants and had embarked with a partner and a small green
handcart on the sale of penny ices The ices had melted away and the
partner had dissolved in their train My young man wore tight yellow
trousers with reddish stripes and his name was Oronte He was sallow but
fair and when I put him into some old clothes of my own he looked like
an Englishman He was as good as Miss Churm who could look when
requested like an Italian




CHAPTER IV


I thought Mrs Monarchs face slightly convulsed when on her coming
back with her husband she found Oronte installed It was strange to
have to recognise in a scrap of a lazzarone a competitor to her
magnificent Major It was she who scented danger first for the Major
was anecdotically unconscious But Oronte gave us tea with a hundred
eager confusionshe had never been concerned in so queer a processand
I think she thought better of me for having at last an establishment
They saw a couple of drawings that I had made of the establishment and
Mrs Monarch hinted that it never would have struck her he had sat for
them Now the drawings you make from US they look exactly like us
she reminded me smiling in triumph and I recognised that this was
indeed just their defect When I drew the Monarchs I couldnt anyhow get
away from themget into the character I wanted to represent and I
hadnt the least desire my model should be discoverable in my picture
Miss Churm never was and Mrs Monarch thought I hid her very properly
because she was vulgar whereas if she was lost it was only as the dead
who go to heaven are lostin the gain of an angel the more

By this time I had got a certain start with Rutland Ramsay the first
novel in the great projected series that is I had produced a dozen
drawings several with the help of the Major and his wife and I had
sent them in for approval My understanding with the publishers as I
have already hinted had been that I was to be left to do my work in
this particular case as I liked with the whole book committed to me
but my connexion with the rest of the series was only contingent There
were moments when frankly it WAS a comfort to have the real thing
under ones hand for there were characters in Rutland Ramsay that were
very much like it There were people presumably as erect as the Major
and women of as good a fashion as Mrs Monarch There was a great deal
of countryhouse lifetreated it is true in a fine fanciful ironical
generalised wayand there was a considerable implication of
knickerbockers and kilts There were certain things I had to settle at
the outset such things for instance as the exact appearance of the hero
and the particular bloom and figure of the heroine The author of course
gave me a lead but there was a margin for interpretation I took the
Monarchs into my confidence I told them frankly what I was about I
mentioned my embarrassments and alternatives Oh take HIM Mrs
Monarch murmured sweetly looking at her husband and What could you
want better than my wife the Major inquired with the comfortable
candour that now prevailed between us

I wasnt obliged to answer these remarksI was only obliged to place my
sitters I wasnt easy in mind and I postponed a little timidly perhaps
the solving of my question The book was a large canvas the other
figures were numerous and I worked off at first some of the episodes in
which the hero and the heroine were not concerned When once I had set
THEM up I should have to stick to themI couldnt make my young man
seven feet high in one place and five feet nine in another I inclined
on the whole to the latter measurement though the Major more than once
reminded me that he looked about as young as any one It was indeed
quite possible to arrange him for the figure so that it would have
been difficult to detect his age After the spontaneous Oronte had been
with me a month and after I had given him to understand several times
over that his native exuberance would presently constitute an
insurmountable barrier to our further intercourse I waked to a sense of
his heroic capacity He was only five feet seven but the remaining
inches were latent I tried him almost secretly at first for I was
really rather afraid of the judgement my other models would pass on such
a choice If they regarded Miss Churm as little better than a snare what
would they think of the representation by a person so little the real
thing as an Italian streetvendor of a protagonist formed by a public
school

If I went a little in fear of them it wasnt because they bullied me
because they had got an oppressive foothold but because in their really
pathetic decorum and mysteriously permanent newness they counted on me
so intensely I was therefore very glad when Jack Hawley came home he
was always of such good counsel He painted badly himself but there was
no one like him for putting his finger on the place He had been absent
from England for a year he had been somewhereI dont remember
whereto get a fresh eye I was in a good deal of dread of any such
organ but we were old friends he had been away for months and a sense
of emptiness was creeping into my life I hadnt dodged a missile for a
year

He came back with a fresh eye but with the same old black velvet
blouse and the first evening he spent in my studio we smoked cigarettes
till the small hours He had done no work himself he had only got the
eye so the field was clear for the production of my little things He
wanted to see what I had produced for the CHEAPSIDE but he was
disappointed in the exhibition That at least seemed the meaning of two
or three comprehensive groans which as he lounged on my big divan his
leg folded under him looking at my latest drawings issued from his
lips with the smoke of the cigarette

Whats the matter with you I asked

Whats the matter with you

Nothing save that Im mystified

You are indeed Youre quite off the hinge Whats the meaning of this
new fad And he tossed me with visible irreverence a drawing in which
I happened to have depicted both my elegant models I asked if he didnt
think it good and he replied that it struck him as execrable given the
sort of thing I had always represented myself to him as wishing to
arrive at but I let that passI was so anxious to see exactly what he
meant The two figures in the picture looked colossal but I supposed
this was not what he meant inasmuch as for aught he knew to the
contrary I might have been trying for some such effect I maintained
that I was working exactly in the same way as when he last had done me
the honour to tell me I might do something some day Well theres a
screw loose somewhere he answered wait a bit and Ill discover it
I depended upon him to do so where else was the fresh eye But he
produced at last nothing more luminous than I dont knowI dont like
your types This was lame for a critic who had never consented to
discuss with me anything but the question of execution the direction of
strokes and the mystery of values

In the drawings youve been looking at I think my types are very
handsome

Oh they wont do

Ive been working with new models

I see you have THEY wont do

Are you very sure of that

Absolutelytheyre stupid

You mean I amfor I ought to get round that

You cantwith such people Who are they

I told him so far as was necessary and he concluded heartlessly CE
SONT DES GENS QUIL FAUT METTRE A LA PORTE

Youve never seen them theyre awfully goodI flew to their defence

Not seen them Why all this recent work of yours drops to pieces with
them Its all I want to see of them

No one else has said anything against itthe CHEAPSIDE people are
pleased

Every one else is an ass and the CHEAPSIDE people the biggest asses of
all Come dont pretend at this time of day to have pretty illusions
about the public especially about publishers and editors Its not for
SUCH animals you workits for those who know COLORO CHE SANNO so
keep straight for me if you cant keep straight for yourself There was
a certain sort of thing you used to try forand a very good thing it
was But this twaddle isnt in it When I talked with Hawley later
about Rutland Ramsay and its possible successors he declared that I
must get back into my boat again or I should go to the bottom His voice
in short was the voice of warning

I noted the warning but I didnt turn my friends out of doors They
bored me a good deal but the very fact that they bored me admonished me
not to sacrifice themif there was anything to be done with
themsimply to irritation As I look back at this phase they seem to me
to have pervaded my life not a little I have a vision of them as most
of the time in my studio seated against the wall on an old velvet bench
to be out of the way and resembling the while a pair of patient
courtiers in a royal antechamber Im convinced that during the coldest
weeks of the winter they held their ground because it saved them fire
Their newness was losing its gloss and it was impossible not to feel
them objects of charity Whenever Miss Churm arrived they went away and
after I was fairly launched in Rutland Ramsay Miss Churm arrived
pretty often They managed to express to me tacitly that they supposed I
wanted her for the low life of the book and I let them suppose it
since they had attempted to study the workit was lying about the
studiowithout discovering that it dealt only with the highest circles
They had dipped into the most brilliant of our novelists without
deciphering many passages I still took an hour from them now and
again in spite of Jack Hawleys warning it would be time enough to
dismiss them if dismissal should be necessary when the rigour of the
season was over Hawley had made their acquaintancehe had met them at
my firesideand thought them a ridiculous pair Learning that he was a
painter they tried to approach him to show him too that they were the
real thing but he looked at them across the big room as if they were
miles away they were a compendium of everything he most objected to in
the social system of his country Such people as that all convention
and patentleather with ejaculations that stopped conversation had no
business in a studio A studio was a place to learn to see and how
could you see through a pair of featherbeds

The main inconvenience I suffered at their hands was that at first I was
shy of letting it break upon them that my artful little servant had
begun to sit to me for Rutland Ramsay They knew I had been odd
enoughthey were prepared by this time to allow oddity to artiststo
pick a foreign vagabond out of the streets when I might have had a
person with whiskers and credentials but it was some time before they
learned how high I rated his accomplishments They found him in an
attitude more than once but they never doubted I was doing him as an
organgrinder There were several things they never guessed and one of
them was that for a striking scene in the novel in which a footman
briefly figured it occurred to me to make use of Major Monarch as the
menial I kept putting this off I didnt like to ask him to don the
liverybesides the difficulty of finding a livery to fit him At last
one day late in the winter when I was at work on the despised Oronte
who caught ones idea on the wing and was in the glow of feeling myself
go very straight they came in the Major and his wife with their
society laugh about nothing there was less and less to laugh at came
in like countrycallersthey always reminded me of thatwho have
walked across the park after church and are presently persuaded to stay
to luncheon Luncheon was over but they could stay to teaI knew they
wanted it The fit was on me however and I couldnt let my ardour cool
and my work wait with the fading daylight while my model prepared it
So I asked Mrs Monarch if she would mind laying it outa request which
for an instant brought all the blood to her face Her eyes were on her
husbands for a second and some mute telegraphy passed between them
Their folly was over the next instant his cheerful shrewdness put an
end to it So far from pitying their wounded pride I must add I was
moved to give it as complete a lesson as I could They bustled about
together and got out the cups and saucers and made the kettle boil I
know they felt as if they were waiting on my servant and when the tea
was prepared I said Hell have a cup pleasehes tired Mrs
Monarch brought him one where he stood and he took it from her as if he
had been a gentleman at a party squeezing a crushhat with an elbow

Then it came over me that she had made a great effort for memade it
with a kind of noblenessand that I owed her a compensation Each time
I saw her after this I wondered what the compensation could be I
couldnt go on doing the wrong thing to oblige them Oh it WAS the wrong
thing the stamp of the work for which they satHawley was not the only
person to say it now I sent in a large number of the drawings I had
made for Rutland Ramsay and I received a warning that was more to the
point than Hawleys The artistic adviser of the house for which I was
working was of opinion that many of my illustrations were not what had
been looked for Most of these illustrations were the subjects in which
the Monarchs had figured Without going into the question of what HAD
been looked for I had to face the fact that at this rate I shouldnt
get the other books to do I hurled myself in despair on Miss ChurmI
put her through all her paces I not only adopted Oronte publicly as my
hero but one morning when the Major looked in to see if I didnt
require him to finish a CHEAPSIDE figure for which he had begun to sit
the week before I told him I had changed my mindId do the drawing
from my man At this my visitor turned pale and stood looking at me Is
HE your idea of an English gentleman he asked

I was disappointed I was nervous I wanted to get on with my work so
I replied with irritation Oh my dear MajorI cant be ruined for
YOU

It was a horrid speech but he stood another momentafter which
without a word he quitted the studio I drew a long breath for I said
to myself that I shouldnt see him again I hadnt told him definitely
that I was in danger of having my work rejected but I was vexed at his
not having felt the catastrophe in the air read with me the moral of
our fruitless collaboration the lesson that in the deceptive atmosphere
of art even the highest respectability may fail of being plastic

I didnt owe my friends money but I did see them again They reappeared
together three days later and given all the other facts there was
something tragic in that one It was a clear proof they could find
nothing else in life to do They had threshed the matter out in a dismal
conferencethey had digested the bad news that they were not in for the
series If they werent useful to me even for the CHEAPSIDE their
function seemed difficult to determine and I could only judge at first
that they had come forgivingly decorously to take a last leave This
made me rejoice in secret that I had little leisure for a scene for I
had placed both my other models in position together and I was pegging
away at a drawing from which I hoped to derive glory It had been
suggested by the passage in which Rutland Ramsay drawing up a chair to
Artemisias pianostool says extraordinary things to her while she
ostensibly fingers out a difficult piece of music I had done Miss Churm
at the piano beforeit was an attitude in which she knew how to take on
an absolutely poetic grace I wished the two figures to compose
together with intensity and my little Italian had entered perfectly
into my conception The pair were vividly before me the piano had been
pulled out it was a charming show of blended youth and murmured love
which I had only to catch and keep My visitors stood and looked at it
and I was friendly to them over my shoulder

They made no response but I was used to silent company and went on with
my work only a little disconcertedeven though exhilarated by the
sense that this was at least the ideal thingat not having got rid of
them after all Presently I heard Mrs Monarchs sweet voice beside or
rather above me I wish her hair were a little better done I looked
up and she was staring with a strange fixedness at Miss Churm whose
back was turned to her Do you mind my just touching it she went
ona question which made me spring up for an instant as with the
instinctive fear that she might do the young lady a harm But she
quieted me with a glance I shall never forgetI confess I should like
to have been able to paint thatand went for a moment to my model She
spoke to her softly laying a hand on her shoulder and bending over her
and as the girl understanding gratefully assented she disposed her
rough curls with a few quick passes in such a way as to make Miss
Churms head twice as charming It was one of the most heroic personal
services Ive ever seen rendered Then Mrs Monarch turned away with a
low sigh and looking about her as if for something to do stooped to
the floor with a noble humility and picked up a dirty rag that had
dropped out of my paintbox

The Major meanwhile had also been looking for something to do and
wandering to the other end of the studio saw before him my
breakfastthings neglected unremoved I say cant I be useful HERE
he called out to me with an irrepressible quaver I assented with a
laugh that I fear was awkward and for the next ten minutes while I
worked I heard the light clatter of china and the tinkle of spoons and
glass Mrs Monarch assisted her husbandthey washed up my crockery
they put it away They wandered off into my little scullery and I
afterwards found that they had cleaned my knives and that my slender
stock of plate had an unprecedented surface When it came over me the
latent eloquence of what they were doing I confess that my drawing was
blurred for a momentthe picture swam They had accepted their failure
but they couldnt accept their fate They had bowed their heads in
bewilderment to the perverse and cruel law in virtue of which the real
thing could be so much less precious than the unreal but they didnt
want to starve If my servants were my models then my models might be
my servants They would reverse the partsthe others would sit for the
ladies and gentlemen and THEY would do the work They would still be in
the studioit was an intense dumb appeal to me not to turn them out
Take us on they wanted to saywell do ANYTHING

My pencil dropped from my hand my sitting was spoiled and I got rid of
my sitters who were also evidently rather mystified and awestruck
Then alone with the Major and his wife I had a most uncomfortable
moment He put their prayer into a single sentence I say you
knowjust let US do for you cant you I couldntit was dreadful to
see them emptying my slops but I pretended I could to oblige them for
about a week Then I gave them a sum of money to go away and I never
saw them again I obtained the remaining books but my friend Hawley
repeats that Major and Mrs Monarch did me a permanent harm got me into
false ways If it be true Im content to have paid the pricefor the
memory




THE STORY OF IT




CHAPTER I


The weather had turned so much worse that the rest of the day was
certainly lost The wind had risen and the storm gathered force they
gave from time to time a thump at the firm windows and dashed even
against those protected by the verandah their vicious splotches of rain
Beyond the lawn beyond the cliff the great wet brush of the sky dipped
deep into the sea But the lawn already vivid with the touch of May
showed a violence of watered green the budding shrubs and trees
repeated the note as they tossed their thick masses and the cold
troubled light filling the pretty saloon marked the spring afternoon
as sufficiently young The two ladies seated there in silence could
pursue without difficultyas well as clearly without
interruptiontheir respective tasks a confidence expressed when the
noise of the wind allowed it to be heard by the sharp scratch of Mrs
Dyotts pen at the table where she was busy with letters

Her visitor settled on a small sofa that with a palmtree a screen a
stool a stand a bowl of flowers and three photographs in silver
frames had been arranged near the light woodfire as a choice
cornerMaud Blessingbourne her guest turned audibly though at
intervals neither brief nor regular the leaves of a book covered in
lemoncoloured paper and not yet despoiled of a certain fresh crispness
This effect of the volume for the eye would have made it as
presumably the newest French noveland evidently from the attitude of
the reader goodconsort happily with the special tone of the room a
consistent air of selection and suppression one of the finer aesthetic
evolutions If Mrs Dyott was fond of ancient French furniture and
distinctly difficult about it her inmates could be fondwith whatever
critical cocks of charming darkbraided heads over slender sloping
shouldersof modern French authors Nothing had passed for half an
hournothing at least to be exact but that each of the companions
occasionally and covertly intermitted her pursuit in such a manner as to
ascertain the degree of absorption of the other without turning round
What their silence was charged with therefore was not only a sense of
the weather but a sense so to speak of its own nature Maud
Blessingbourne when she lowered her book into her lap closed her eyes
with a conscious patience that seemed to say she waited but it was
nevertheless she who at last made the movement representing a snap of
their tension She got up and stood by the fire into which she looked a
minute then came round and approached the window as if to see what was
really going on At this Mrs Dyott wrote with refreshed intensity Her
little pile of letters had grown and if a look of determination was
compatible with her fair and slightly faded beauty the habit of
attending to her business could always keep pace with any excursion of
her thought Yet she was the first who spoke

I trust your book has been interesting

Well enough a little mild

A louder throb of the tempest had blurred the sound of the words A
little wild

Dear notimid and tame unless Ive quite lost my sense

Perhaps you have Mrs Dyott placidly suggestedreading so many

Her companion made a motion of feigned despair Ah you take away my
courage for going to my room as I was just meaning to for another

Another French one

Im afraid

Do you carry them by the dozen

Into innocent British homes Maud tried to remember I believe I
brought threeseeing them in a shopwindow as I passed through town It
never rains but it pours But Ive already read two

And are they the only ones you do read

French ones Maud considered Oh no DAnnunzio

And whats that Mrs Dyott asked as she affixed a stamp

Oh you dear thing Her friend was amused yet almost showed pity I
know you dont read Maud went on but why should you YOU live

Yeswretchedly enough Mrs Dyott returned getting her letters
together She left her place holding them as a neat achieved handful
and came over to the fire while Mrs Blessingbourne turned once more to
the window where she was met by another flurry

Maud spoke then as if moved only by the elements Do you expect him
through all this

Mrs Dyott just waited and it had the effect indescribably of making
everything that had gone before seem to have led up to the question
This effect was even deepened by the way she then said Whom do you
mean

Why I thought you mentioned at luncheon that Colonel Voyt was to walk
over Surely he cant

Do you care very much Mrs Dyott asked

Her friend now hesitated It depends on what you call much If you
mean should I like to see himthen certainly

Well my dear I think he understands youre here

So that as he evidently isnt coming Maud laughed its particularly
flattering Or rather she added giving up the prospect again it
would be I think quite extraordinarily flattering if he did Except
that of course she threw in he might come partly for you

Partly is charming Thank you for partly If you ARE going
upstairs will you kindly Mrs Dyott pursued put these into the box
as you pass

The younger woman taking the little pile of letters considered them
with envy Nine You ARE good Youre always a living reproach

Mrs Dyott gave a sigh I dont do it on purpose The only thing this
afternoon she went on reverting to the other question would be
their not having come down

And as to that you dont know

NoI dont know But she caught even as she spoke a rattattat of
the knocker which struck her as a sign Ah there

Then I go And Maud whisked out

Mrs Dyott left alone moved with an air of selection to the window
and it was as so stationed gazing out at the wild weather that the
visitor whose delay to appear spoke of the wiping of boots and the
disposal of drenched mackintosh and cap finally found her He was tall
lean fine with little in him on the whole to confirm the titular in
the Colonel Voyt by which he was announced But he had left the army
so that his reputation for gallantry mainly depended now on his fighting
Liberalism in the House of Commons Even these facts however his
aspect scantily matched partly no doubt because he looked as was
usually said unEnglish His black hair cropped close was lightly
powdered with silver and his dense glossy beard that of an emir or a
caliph and grown for civil reasons repeated its handsome colour and
its somewhat foreign effect His nose had a strong and shapely arch and
the dark grey of his eyes was tinted with blue It had been said of
himin relation to these signsthat he would have struck you as a Jew
had he not in spite of his nose struck you so much as an Irishman
Neither responsibility could in fact have been fixed upon him and just
now at all events he was only a pleasant weatherwashed windbattered
Briton who brought in from a struggle with the elements that he
appeared quite to have enjoyed a certain amount of unremoved mud and an
unusual quantity of easy expression It was exactly the silence ensuing
on the retreat of the servant and the closed door that marked between
him and his hostess the degree of this ease They met as it were
twice the first time while the servant was there and the second as soon
as he was not The difference was great between the two encounters
though we must add in justice to the second that its marks were at first
mainly negative This communion consisted only in their having drawn
each other for a minute as close as possibleas possible that is with
no help but the full clasp of hands Thus they were mutually held and
the closeness was at any rate such that for a little though it took
account of dangers it did without words When words presently came the
pair were talking by the fire and she had rung for tea He had by this
time asked if the note he had despatched to her after breakfast had been
safely delivered

Yes before luncheon But Im always in a state whenexcept for some
extraordinary reasonyou send such things by hand I knew without it
that you had come It never fails Im sure when youre thereIm sure
when youre not

He wiped before the glass his wet moustache I see But this morning
I had an impulse

It was beautiful But they make me as uneasy sometimes your impulses
as if they were calculations make me wonder what you have in reserve

Because when small children are too awfully good they die Well I AM a
small child compared to youbut Im not dead yet I cling to life

He had covered her with his smile but she continued grave Im not
half so much afraid when youre nasty

Thank you What then did you do he asked with my note

You deserve that I should have spread it out on my dressingtableor
left it better still in Maud Blessingbournes room

He wondered while he laughed Oh but what does SHE deserve

It was her gravity that continued to answer Yesit would probably
kill her

She believes so in you

She believes so in YOU So dont be TOO nice to her

He was still looking in the chimneyglass at the state of his
beardbrushing from it with his handkerchief the traces of wind and
wet If she also then prefers me when Im nasty it seems to me I ought
to satisfy her Shall I now at any rate see her

Shes so like a pea on a pan over the possibility of it that shes
pulling herself together in her room

Oh then we must try and keep her together But why graceful tender
pretty tooquite or almost as she isdoesnt she remarry

Mrs Dyott appearedand as if the first timeto look for the reason
Because she likes too many men

It kept up his spirits And how many MAY a lady like

In order not to like any of them too much Ah that you know I never
found outand its too late now When she presently pursued did you
last see her

He really had to think Would it have been since last November or
sosomewhere or other where we spent three days

Oh at Surredge I know all about that I thought you also met
afterwards

He had again to recall So we did Wouldnt it have been somewhere at
Christmas But it wasnt by arrangement he laughed giving with his
forefinger a little pleasant nick to his hostesss chin Then as if
something in the way she received this attention put him back to his
question of a moment before Have you kept my note

She held him with her pretty eyes Do you want it back

Ah dont speak as if I did take things

She dropped her gaze to the fire No you dont not even the hard
things a really generous nature often would She quitted however as
if to forget that the chimneyplace I put it THERE

Youve burnt it Good It made him easier but he noticed the next
moment on a table the lemoncoloured volume left there by Mrs
Blessingbourne and taking it up for a look immediately put it down
You might while you were about it have burnt that too

Youve read it

Dear yes And you

No said Mrs Dyott it wasnt for me Maud brought it

It pulled her visitor up Mrs Blessingbourne brought it

For such a day as this But she wondered How you look Is it so
awful

Oh like his others Something had occurred to him his thought was
already far Does she know

Know what

Why anything

But the door opened too soon for Mrs Dyott who could only murmur
quicklyTake care




CHAPTER II


It was in fact Mrs Blessingbourne who had under her arm the book she
had gone up fora pair of covers showing this time a pretty a candid
blue She was followed next minute by the servant who brought in tea
the consumption of which with the passage of greetings inquiries and
other light civilities between the two visitors occupied a quarter of
an hour Mrs Dyott meanwhile as a contribution to so much amenity
mentioned to Maud that her fellow guest wished to scold her for the
books she reada statement met by this friend with the remark that he
must first be sure about them But as soon as he had picked up the new
the blue volume he broke out into a frank Dear dear

Have you read that too Mrs Dyott inquired How much youll have to
talk over together The other one she explained to him Maud speaks
of as terribly tame

Ah I must have that out with her You dont feel the extraordinary
force of the fellow Voyt went on to Mrs Blessingbourne

And so round the hearth they talkedtalked soon while they warmed
their toes with zest enough to make it seem as happy a chance as any of
the quieter opportunities their imprisonment might have involved Mrs
Blessingbourne did feel it then appeared the force of the fellow but
she had her reserves and reactions in which Voyt was much interested
Mrs Dyott rather detached herself mainly gazing as she leaned back
at the fire she intervened however enough to relieve Maud of the
sense of being listened to That sense with Maud was too apt to convey
that one was listened to for a fool Yes when I read a novel I mostly
read a French one she had said to Voyt in answer to a question about
her usual practice for I seem with it to get hold more of the real
thingto get more life for my money Only Im not so infatuated with
them but that sometimes for months and months on end I dont read any
fiction at all

The two books were now together beside them Then when you begin again
you read a mass

Dear no I only keep up with three or four authors

He laughed at this over the cigarette he had been allowed to light I
like your keeping up and keeping up in particular with authors

One must keep up with somebody Mrs Dyott threw off

I daresay Im ridiculous Mrs Blessingbourne conceded without heeding
it but thats the way we express ourselves in my part of the country

I only alluded said Voyt to the tremendous conscience of your sex
Its more than mine can keep up with You take everything too hard But
if you cant read the novel of British and American manufacture heaven
knows Im at one with you It seems really to show our sense of life as
the sense of puppies and kittens

Well Maud more patiently returned Im told all sorts of people are
now doing wonderful things but somehow I remain outside

Ah its THEY its our poor twangers and twaddlers who remain outside
They pick up a living in the street And who indeed would want them in

Mrs Blessingbourne seemed unable to say and yet at the same time to
have her idea The subject in truth she evidently found was not so
easy to handle People lend me things and I try but at the end of
fifty pages

There you are Yesheaven help us

But what I mean she went on isnt that I dont get woefully weary
of the eternal French thing Whats THEIR sense of life

AH VOILA Mrs Dyott softly sounded

Oh but it IS one you can make it out Voyt promptly declared They
do what they feel and they feel more things than we They strike so
many more notes and with so different a hand When it comes to any
account of a relation say between a man and a womanI mean an intimate
or a curious or a suggestive onewhere are we compared to them They
dont exhaust the subject no doubt he admitted but we dont touch
it dont even skim it Its as if we denied its existence its
possibility Youll doubtless tell me however he went on that as
all such relations ARE for us at the most much simpler we can only have
all round less to say about them

She met this imputation with the quickest amusement I beg your pardon
I dont think I shall tell you anything of the sort I dont know that I
even agree with your premiss

About such relations He looked agreeably surprised You think we
make them largeror subtler

Mrs Blessingbourne leaned back not looking like Mrs Dyott at the
fire but at the ceiling I dont know what I think

Its not that she doesnt know Mrs Dyott remarked Its only that
she doesnt say

But Voyt had this time no eye for their hostess For a moment he watched
Maud It sticks out of you you know that youve yourself written
something Havent youand published Ive a notion I could read YOU

When I do publish she said without moving youll be the last one I
shall tell I HAVE she went on a lovely subject but it would take
an amount of treatment

Tell us then at least what it is

At this she again met his eyes Oh to tell it would be to express it
and thats just what I cant do What I meant to say just now she
added was that the French to my sense give us only again and again
for ever and ever the same couple There they are once more as one has
had them to satiety in that yellow thing and there I shall certainly
again find them in the blue

Then why do you keep reading about them Mrs Dyott demanded

Maud cast about I dont she sighed At all events I shant any
more I give it up

Youve been looking for something I judge said Colonel Voyt that
youre not likely to find It doesnt exist

What is it Mrs Dyott desired to know

I never look Maud remarked for anything but an interest

Naturally But your interest Voyt replied is in something different
from life

Ah not a bit I LOVE life in art though I hate it anywhere else Its
the poverty of the life those people show and the awful bounders of
both sexes that they represent

Oh now we have you her interlocutor laughed To me when alls said
and done they seem to beas near as art can comein the truth of the
truth It can only take what life gives it though it certainly may be a
pity that that isnt better Your complaint of their monotony is a
complaint of their conditions When you say we get always the same
couple what do you mean but that we get always the same passion Of
course we do Voyt pursued If what youre looking for is another
thats what you wont anywhere find

Maud for a while said nothing and Mrs Dyott seemed to wait Well I
suppose Im looking more than anything else for a decent woman

Oh then you mustnt look for her in pictures of passion Thats not her
element nor her whereabouts

Mrs Blessingbourne weighed the objection Does it not depend on what
you mean by passion

I think I can mean only one thing the enemy to behaviour

Oh I can imagine passions that are on the contrary friends to it

Her fellowguest thought Doesnt it depend perhaps on what you mean by
behaviour

Dear no Behaviours just behaviourthe most definite thing in the
world

Then what do you mean by the interest you just now spoke of The
picture of that definite thing

Yescall it that Women arent ALWAYS vicious even when theyre

When theyre what Voyt pressed

When theyre unhappy They can be unhappy and good

That one doesnt for a moment deny But can they be good and
interesting

That must be Mauds subject Mrs Dyott interposed To show a woman
who IS Im afraid my dear she continued you could only show
yourself

Youd show then the most beautiful specimen conceivableand Voyt
addressed himself to Maud But doesnt it prove that life is against
your contention more interesting than art Life you embellish and
elevate but art would find itself able to do nothing with you and on
such impossible terms would ruin you

The colour in her faint consciousness gave beauty to her stare Ruin
me

He means Mrs Dyott again indicated that youd ruin art

Without on the other handVoyt seemed to assentits giving at all a
coherent impression of you

She wants her romance cheap said Mrs Dyott

Oh noI should be willing to pay for it I dont see why the
romancesince you give it that nameshould be all as the French
inveterately make it for the women who are bad

Oh they pay for it said Mrs Dyott

DO they

So at leastMrs Dyott a little corrected herselfone has gathered
for I dont read your books you know that theyre usually shown as
doing

Maud wondered but looking at Voyt Theyre shown often no doubt as
paying for their badness But are they shown as paying for their
romance

My dear lady said Voyt their romance is their badness There isnt
any other Its a hard law if you will and a strange but goodness has
to go without that luxury Isnt to BE good just exactly all round to
go without He put it before her kindly and clearlyregretfully too
as if he were sorry the truth should be so sad He and she his pleasant
eyes seemed to say would had they had the making of it have made it
better One has heard it beforeat least I have one has heard your
question put But always when put to a mind not merely muddled for an
inevitable answer Why dont you CHER MONSIEUR give us the drama of
virtue Because CHERE MADAME the high privilege of virtue is
precisely to avoid drama The adventures of the honest lady The honest
lady hasnt cant possibly have adventures

Mrs Blessingbourne only met his eyes at first smiling with some
intensity Doesnt it depend a little on what you call adventures

My poor Maud said Mrs Dyott as if in compassion for sophistry so
simple adventures are just adventures Thats all you can make of
them

But her friend talked for their companion and as if without hearing
Doesnt it depend a good deal on what you call drama Maud spoke as
one who had already thought it out Doesnt it depend on what you call
romance

Her listener gave these arguments his very best attention Of course
you may call things anything you likespeak of them as one thing and
mean quite another But why should it depend on anything Behind these
words we usethe adventure the novel the drama the romance the
situation in short as we most comprehensively saybehind them all
stands the same sharp fact which they all in their different ways
represent

Precisely Mrs Dyott was full of approval

Maud however was full of vagueness What great fact

The fact of a relation The adventures a relation the relations an
adventure The romance the novel the drama are the picture of one The
subject the novelist treats is the rise the formation the development
the climax and for the most part the decline of one And what is the
honest lady doing on that side of the town

Mrs Dyott was more pointed She doesnt so much as FORM a relation

But Maud bore up Doesnt it depend again on what you call a relation

Oh said Mrs Dyott if a gentleman picks up her
pockethandkerchief

Ah even thats one their friend laughed if she has thrown it to
him We can only deal with one that is one

Surely Maud replied But if its an innocent one

Doesnt it depend a good deal Mrs Dyott asked on what you call
innocent

You mean that the adventures of innocence have so often been the
material of fiction Yes Voyt replied thats exactly what the bored
reader complains of He has asked for bread and been given a stone What
is it but with absolute directness a question of interest or as
people say of the story Whats a situation undeveloped but a subject
lost If a relation stops wheres the story If it doesnt stop
wheres the innocence It seems to me you must choose It would be very
pretty if it were otherwise but thats how we flounder Art is our
flounderings shown

Mrs Blessingbourneand with an air of deference scarce supported
perhaps by its sketchinesskept her deep eyes on this definition But
sometimes we flounder out

It immediately touched in Colonel Voyt the spring of a genial derision
Thats just where I expected YOU would One always sees it come

He has you notice Mrs Dyott parenthesised to Maud seen it come so
often and he has always waited for it and met it

Met it dear lady simply enough Its the old story Mrs
Blessingbourne The relations innocent that the heroine gets out of
The books innocent thats the story of her getting out But what the
devilin the name of innocencewas she doing IN

Mrs Dyott promptly echoed the question You have to be in you know
to GET out So there you are already with your relation Its the end of
your goodness

And the beginning said Voyt of your play

Arent they all for that matter even the worst Mrs Dyott pursued
supposed SOME time or other to get out But if meanwhile theyve been
in however briefly long enough to adorn a tale

Theyve been in long enough to point a moral That is to point ours
With which and as if a sudden flush of warmer light had moved him
Colonel Voyt got up The veil of the storm had parted over a great red
sunset

Mrs Dyott also was on her feet and they stood before his charming
antagonist who with eyes lowered and a somewhat fixed smile had not
moved

Weve spoiled her subject the elder lady sighed

Well said Voyt its better to spoil an artists subject than to
spoil his reputation I mean he explained to Maud with his indulgent
manner his appearance of knowing what he has got hold of for that in
the last resort is his happiness

She slowly rose at this facing him with an aspect as handsomely mild as
his own You cant spoil my happiness

He held her hand an instant as he took leave I wish I could add to
it




CHAPTER III


When he had quitted them and Mrs Dyott had candidly asked if her friend
had found him rude or crude Maud repliedthough not immediatelythat
she had feared showing only too much how charming she found him But if
Mrs Dyott took this it was to weigh the sense How could you show it
too much

Because I always feel that thats my only way of showing anything Its
absurd if you like Mrs Blessingbourne pursued but I never know in
such intense discussions what strange impression I may give

Her companion looked amused Was it intense

_I_ was Maud frankly confessed

Then its a pity you were so wrong Colonel Voyt you know is right
Mrs Blessingbourne at this gave one of the slow soft silent headshakes
to which she often resorted and which mostly accompanied by the light
of cheer had somehow in spite of the small obstinacy that smiled in
them a special grace With this grace for a moment her friend
looking her up and down appeared impressed yet not too much so to take
the next minute a decision Oh my dear Im sorry to differ from any
one so lovelyfor youre awfully beautiful tonight and your frocks
the very nicest Ive ever seen you wear But hes as right as he can
be

Maud repeated her motion Not so right at all events as he thinks he
is Or perhaps I can say she went on after an instant that Im not
so wrong I do know a little what Im talking about

Mrs Dyott continued to study her You ARE vexed You naturally dont
like itsuch destruction

Destruction

Of your illusion

I HAVE no illusion If I had moreover it wouldnt be destroyed I have
on the whole I think my little decency

Mrs Dyott stared Let us grant it for argument What then

Well Ive also my little drama

An attachment

An attachment

That you shouldnt have

That I shouldnt have

A passion

A passion

Shared

Ah thank goodness no

Mrs Dyott continued to gaze The objects unaware

Utterly

Mrs Dyott turned it over Are you sure

Sure

Thats what you call your decency But isnt it Mrs Dyott asked
rather his

Dear no Its only his good fortune

Mrs Dyott laughed But yours darlingyour good fortune where does
THAT come in

Why in my sense of the romance of it

The romance of what Of his not knowing

Of my not wanting him to If I didMaud had touchingly worked it
outwhere would be my honesty

The inquiry for an instant held her friend yet only it seemed for a
stupefaction that was almost amusement Can you want or not want as you
like Where in the world if you dont want is your romance

Mrs Blessingbourne still wore her smile and she now with a light
gesture that matched it just touched the region of her heart There

Her companion admiringly marvelled A lovely place for it no
doubtbut not quite a place that I can see to make the sentiment a
relation

Why not What more is required for a relation for me

Oh all sorts of things I should say And many more added to those to
make it one for the person you mention

Ah that I dont pretend it either should be or CAN be I only speak for
myself

This was said in a manner that made Mrs Dyott with a visible mixture
of impressions suddenly turn away She indulged in a vague movement or
two as if to look for something then again found herself near her
friend on whom with the same abruptness in fact with a strange
sharpness she conferred a kiss that might have represented either her
tribute to exalted consistency or her idea of a graceful close of the
discussion You deserve that one should speak FOR you

Her companion looked cheerful and secure How CAN you without
knowing

Oh by guessing Its not

But that was as far as Mrs Dyott could get Its not said Maud any
one youve ever seen

Ah then I give you up

And Mrs Dyott conformed for the rest of Mauds stay to the spirit of
this speech It was made on a Saturday night and Mrs Blessingbourne
remained till the Wednesday following an interval during which as the
return of fine weather was confirmed by the Sunday the two ladies found
a wider range of action There were drives to be taken calls made
objects of interest seen at a distance with the effect of much easy
talk and still more easy silence There had been a question of Colonel
Voyts probable return on the Sunday but the whole time passed without
a sign from him and it was merely mentioned by Mrs Dyott in
explanation that he must have been suddenly called as he was so liable
to be to town That this in fact was what had happened he made clear to
her on Thursday afternoon when walking over again late he found her
alone The consequence of his Sunday letters had been his taking that
day the 415 Mrs Voyt had gone back on Thursday and he now to
settle on the spot the question of a piece of work begun at his place
had rushed down for a few hours in anticipation of the usual collective
move for the weeks end He was to go up again by the late train and
had to count a littlea fact accepted by his hostess with the hard
pliancy of practicehis present happy moments Too few as these were
however he found time to make of her an inquiry or two not directly
bearing on their situation The first was a recall of the question for
which Mrs Blessingbournes entrance on the previous Saturday had
arrested her answer Had that lady the idea of anything between them

No Im sure Theres one idea she has got Mrs Dyott went on but
its quite different and not so very wonderful

What then is it

Well that shes herself in love

Voyt showed his interest You mean she told you

I got it out of her

He showed his amusement Poor thing And with whom

With you

His surprise if the distinction might be made was less than his
wonder You got that out of her too

Noit remains in Which is much the best way for it For you to know
it would be to end it

He looked rather cheerfully at sea Is that then why you tell me

I mean for her to know you know it Therefore its in your interest not
to let her

I see Voyt after a moment returned Your real calculation is that my
interest will be sacrificed to my vanityso that if your other idea is
just the flame will in fact and thanks to her morbid conscience
expire by her taking fright at seeing me so pleased But I promise you
he declared that she shant see it So there you are She kept her
eyes on him and had evidently to admit after a little that there she
was Distinct as he had made the case however he wasnt yet quite
satisfied Why are you so sure Im the man

From the way she denies you

You put it to her

Straight If you hadnt been shed of course have confessed to youto
keep me in the dark about the real one

Poor Voyt laughed out again Oh you dear souls

Besides his companion pursued I wasnt in want of that evidence

Then what other had you

Her state before you camewhich was what made me ask you how much you
had seen her And her state after it Mrs Dyott added And her
state she wound up while you were here

But her state while I was here was charming

Charming Thats just what I say

She said it in a tone that placed the matter in its right lighta light
in which they appeared kindly quite tenderly to watch Maud wander away
into space with her lovely head bent under a theory rather too big for
it Voyts last word however was that there was just enough in itin
the theoryfor them to allow that she had not shown herself on the
occasion of their talk wholly bereft of sense Her consciousness if
they let it aloneas they of course after this mercifully mustWAS in
the last analysis a kind of shy romance Not a romance like their own
a thing to make the fortune of any author up to the markone who should
have the invention or who COULD have the courage but a small scared
starved subjective satisfaction that would do her no harm and nobody
else any good Who but a dufferhe stuck to his contentionwould see
the shadow of a story in it




FLICKERBRIDGE




CHAPTER I


Frank Granger had arrived from Paris to paint a portraitan order given
him as a young compatriot with a future whose early work would some
day have a price by a lady from New York a friend of his own people
and also as it happened of Addies the young woman to whom it was
publicly both affirmed and denied that he was engaged Other young women
in Parisfellowmembers there of the little tight transpontine world of
artstudyprofessed to know that the pair had several times over
renewed their fond understanding This however was their own affair
the last phase of the relation the last time of the times had passed
into vagueness there was perhaps even an impression that if they were
inscrutable to their friends they were not wholly crystalline to each
other and themselves What had occurred for Granger at all events in
connexion with the portrait was that Mrs Bracken his intending model
whose return to America was at hand had suddenly been called to London
by her husband occupied there with pressing business but had yet
desired that her displacement should not interrupt her sittings The
young man at her request had followed her to England and profited by
all she could give him making shift with a small studio lent him by a
London painter whom he had known and liked a few years before in the
French atelier that then cradled and that continued to cradle so many
of their kind

The British capital was a strange grey world to him where people
walked in more ways than one by a dim light but he was happily of
such a turn that the impression just as it came could nowhere ever
fail him and even the worst of these things was almost as much an
occupationputting it only at thatas the best Mrs Bracken moreover
passed him on and while the darkness ebbed a little in the April days
he found himself consolingly committed to a couple of fresh subjects
This cut him out work for more than another month but meanwhile as he
said he saw a lota lot that with frequency and with much expression
he wrote about to Addie She also wrote to her absent friend but in
briefer snatches a meagreness to her reasons for which he had long
since assented She had other play for her pen as well as fortunately
other remuneration a regular correspondence for a prominent Boston
paper fitful connexions with public sheets perhaps also in cases
fitful and a mind above all engrossed at times to the exclusion of
everything else with the study of the short story This last was what
she had mainly come out to go into two or three years after he had
found himself engulfed in the mystery of Carolus She was indeed on her
own deep sea more engulfed than he had ever been and he had grown to
accept the sense that for progress too she sailed under more canvas
It hadnt been particularly present to him till now that he had in the
least got on but the way in which Addie hadand evidently still more
wouldwas the theme as it were of every tongue She had thirty short
stories out and nine descriptive articles His three or four portraits
of fat American ladiesthey were all fat all ladies and all
Americanwere a poor show compared with these triumphs especially as
Addie had begun to throw out that it was about time they should go home
It kept perpetually coming up in Paris in the transpontine world that
as the phrase was America had grown more interesting since they left
Addie was attentive to the rumour and as full of conscience as she was
of taste of patriotism as of curiosity had often put it to him
frankly with what he who was of New York recognised as her New
England emphasis Im not sure you know that we do REAL justice to
our country Granger felt he would do it on the dayif the day ever
camehe should irrevocably marry her No other country could possibly
have produced her




CHAPTER II


But meanwhile it befell that in London he was stricken with influenza
and with subsequent sorrow The attack was short but sharphad it
lasted Addie would certainly have come to his aid most of a blight
really in its secondary stage The good ladies his sittersthe ladies
with the frizzled hair with the diamond earrings with the chins
tending to the massiveleft for him at the door of his lodgings
flowers soup and love so that with their assistance he pulled through
but his convalescence was slow and his weakness out of proportion to the
muffled shock He came out but he went about lame it tired him to
painthe felt as if he had been ill three months He strolled in
Kensington Gardens when he should have been at work he sat long on
penny chairs and helplessly mused and mooned Addie desired him to
return to Paris but there were chances under his hand that he felt he
had just wit enough left not to relinquish He would have gone for a
week to the seahe would have gone to Brighton but Mrs Bracken had to
be finishedMrs Bracken was so soon to sail He just managed to finish
her in timethe day before the date fixed for his breaking ground on a
greater business still the circumvallation of Mrs Dunn Mrs Dunn duly
waited on him and he sat down before her feeling however ere he
rose that he must take a long breath before the attack While asking
himself that night therefore where he should best replenish his lungs
he received from Addie who had had from Mrs Bracken a poor report of
him a communication which besides being of sudden and startling
interest applied directly to his case

His friend wrote to him under the lively emotion of having from one day
to another become aware of a new relative an ancient cousin a
sequestered gentlewoman the sole survival of the English branch of the
family still resident at Flickerbridge in the old family home and
with whom that he might immediately betake himself to so auspicious a
quarter for change of air she had already done what was proper to place
him as she said in touch What came of it all to be brief was that
Granger found himself so placed almost as he read he was in touch with
Miss Wenham of Flickerbridge to the extent of being in correspondence
with her before twentyfour hours had sped And on the second day he
was in the train settled for a fivehours run to the door of this
amiable woman who had so abruptly and kindly taken him on trust and of
whom but yesterday he had never so much as heard This was an
odditythe whole incident wasof which in the corner of his
compartment as he proceeded he had time to take the size But the
surprise the incongruity as he felt could but deepen as he went It
was a sufficiently queer note in the light or the absence of it of
his late experience that so complex a product as Addie should have ANY
simple insular tie but it was a queerer note still that she should have
had one so long only to remain unprofitably unconscious of it Not to
have done something with it used it worked it talked about it at
least and perhaps even writtenthese things at the rate she moved
represented a loss of opportunity under which as he saw her she was
peculiarly formed to wince She was at any rate it was clear doing
something with it now using it working it certainly already
talkingand yes quite possibly writingabout it She was in short
smartly making up what she had missed and he could take such comfort
from his own action as he had been helped to by the rest of the facts
succinctly reported from Paris on the very morning of his start

It was the singular story of a sharp splitin a good English
housethat dated now from years back A worthy Briton of the best
middling stock had during the fourth decade of the century as a very
young man in Dresden whither he had been despatched to qualify in
German for a stool in an uncles countinghouse met admired wooed and
won an American girl of due attractions domiciled at that period with
her parents and a sister who was also attractive in the Saxon capital
He had married her taken her to England and there after some years of
harmony and happiness lost her The sister in question had after her
death come to him and to his young child on a visit the effect of
which between the pair eventually defined itself as a sentiment that
was not to be resisted The bereaved husband yielding to a new
attachment and a new response and finding a new union thus prescribed
had yet been forced to reckon with the unaccommodating law of the land
Encompassed with frowns in his own country however marriages of this
particular type were wreathed in smiles in his sistersinlaw so that
his remedy was not forbidden Choosing between two allegiances he had
let the one go that seemed the least close and had in brief
transplanted his possibilities to an easier air The knot was tied for
the couple in New York where to protect the legitimacy of such other
children as might come to them they settled and prospered Children
came and one of the daughters growing up and marrying in her turn
was if Frank rightly followed the mother of his own Addie who had
been deprived of the knowledge of her indeed in childhood by death
and been brought up though without undue tension by a stepmothera
character breaking out thus anew

The breach produced in England by the invidious action as it was there
held of the girls grandfather had not failed to widenall the more
that nothing had been done on the American side to close it Frigidity
had settled and hostility had been arrested only by indifference
Darkness therefore had fortunately supervened and a cousinship
completely divided On either side of the impassable gulf of the
impenetrable curtain each branch had put forth its leavesa foliage
wanting in the American quarter it was distinct enough to Granger of
no sign or symptom of climate and environment The graft in New York had
taken and Addie was a vivid an unmistakable flower At Flickerbridge
or wherever on the other hand strange to say the parent stem had had
a fortune comparatively meagre Fortune it was true in the vulgarest
sense had attended neither party Addies immediate belongings were as
poor as they were numerous and he gathered that Miss Wenhams
pretensions to wealth were not so marked as to expose the claim of
kinship to the imputation of motive To this ladys single identity the
original stock had at all events dwindled and our young man was
properly warned that he would find her shy and solitary What was
singular was that in these conditions she should desire she should
endure to receive him But that was all another story lucid enough
when mastered He kept Addies letters exceptionally copious in his
lap he conned them at intervals he held the threads

He looked out between whiles at the pleasant English land an April
AQUARELLE washed in with wondrous breadth He knew the French thing he
knew the American but he had known nothing of this He saw it already
as the remarkable Miss Wenhams setting The doctors daughter at
Flickerbridge with nippers on her nose a palette on her thumb and
innocence in her heart had been the miraculous link She had become
aware even there in our world of wonders that the current fashion for
young women so equipped was to enter the Parisian lists Addie had
accordingly chanced upon her on the slopes of Montparnasse as one of
the English girls in one of the thoroughgoing sets They had met in
some easy collocation and had fallen upon common ground after which the
young woman restored to Flickerbridge for an interlude and retailing
there her adventures and impressions had mentioned to Miss Wenham who
had known and protected her from babyhood that that ladys own name of
Adelaide was as well as the surname conjoined with it borne to her
knowledge in Paris by an extraordinary American specimen She had then
recrossed the Channel with a wonderful message a courteous challenge
to her friends duplicate who had in turn granted through her every
satisfaction The duplicate had in other words bravely let Miss Wenham
know exactly who she was Miss Wenham in whose personal tradition the
flame of resentment appeared to have been reduced by time to the palest
ashesfor whom indeed the story of the great schism was now but a
legend only needing a little less dimness to make it romanticMiss
Wenham had promptly responded by a letter fragrant with the hope that
old threads might be taken up It was a relationship that they must
puzzle out together and she had earnestly sounded the other party to it
on the subject of a possible visit Addie had met her with a definite
promise she would come soon she would come when free she would come
in July but meanwhile she sent her deputy Frank asked himself by what
name she had described by what character introduced him to
Flickerbridge He mainly felt on the whole as if he were going there to
find out if he were engaged to her He was at sea really now as to which
of the various views Addie herself took of it To Miss Wenham she must
definitely have taken one and perhaps Miss Wenham would reveal it This
expectation was in fact his excuse for a possible indiscretion




CHAPTER III


He was indeed to learn on arrival to what he had been committed but
that was for a while so much a part of his first general impression that
the particular truth took time to detach itself the first general
impression demanding verily all his faculties of response He almost
felt for a day or two the victim of a practical joke a gross abuse of
confidence He had presented himself with the moderate amount of flutter
involved in a sense of due preparation but he had then found that
however primed with prefaces and prompted with hints he hadnt been
prepared at all How COULD he be he asked himself for anything so
foreign to his experience so alien to his proper world so little to be
preconceived in the sharp north light of the newest impressionism and
yet so recognised after all in the event so noted and tasted and
assimilated It was a case he would scarce have known how to
describecould doubtless have described best with a full clean brush
supplemented by a play of gesture for it was always his habit to see an
occasion of whatever kind primarily as a picture so that he might get
it as he was wont to say so that he might keep it well together He
had been treated of a sudden in this adventure to one of the sweetest
fairest coolest impressions of his lifeone moreover visibly complete
and homogeneous from the start Oh it was THERE if that was all one
wanted of a thing It was so there that as had befallen him in Italy
in Spain confronted at last in dusky sidechapel or rich museum with
great things dreamed of or with greater ones unexpectedly presented he
had held his breath for fear of breaking the spell had almost from the
quick impulse to respect to prolong lowered his voice and moved on
tiptoe Supreme beauty suddenly revealed is apt to strike us as a
possible illusion playing with our desireinstant freedom with it to
strike us as a possible rashness

This fortunately howeverand the more so as his freedom for the time
quite left himdidnt prevent his hostess the evening of his advent
and while the vision was new from being exactly as queer and rare and
IMPAYABLE as improbable as impossible as delightful at the eight
oclock dinnershe appeared to keep these immense hoursas she had
overwhelmingly been at the five oclock tea She was in the most natural
way in the world one of the oddest apparitions but that the particular
means to such an end COULD be natural was an inference difficult to
make He failed in fact to make it for a couple of days but
thenthough then onlyhe made it with confidence By this time indeed
he was sure of everything luckily including himself If we compare his
impression with slight extravagance to some of the greatest he had
ever received this is simply because the image before him was so
rounded and stamped It expressed with pure perfection it exhausted its
character It was so absolutely and so unconsciously what it was He had
been floated by the strangest of chances out of the rushing stream into
a clear still backwatera deep and quiet pool in which objects were
sharply mirrored He had hitherto in life known nothing that was old
except a few statues and pictures but here everything was old was
immemorial and nothing so much so as the very freshness itself Vaguely
to have supposed there were such nooks in the world had done little
enough he now saw to temper the glare of their opposites It was the
fine touches that counted and these had to be seen to be believed

Miss Wenham fiftyfive years of age and unappeasably timid
unaccountably strange had on her reduced scale an almost Gothic
grotesqueness but the final effect of ones sense of it was an amenity
that accompanied ones steps like wafted gratitude More flurried more
spasmodic more apologetic more completely at a loss at one moment and
more precipitately abounding at another he had never before in all his
days seen any maiden lady yet for no maiden lady he had ever seen had
he so promptly conceived a private enthusiasm Her eyes protruded her
chin receded and her nose carried on in conversation a queer little
independent motion She wore on the top of her head an upright circular
cap that made her resemble a caryatid disburdened and on other parts of
her person strange combinations of colours stuffs shapes of metal
mineral and plant The tones of her voice rose and fell her facial
convulsions whether tendingone could scarce make outto expression
or REpression succeeded each other by a law of their own she was
embarrassed at nothing and at everything frightened at everything and
at nothing and she approached objects subjects the simplest questions
and answers and the whole material of intercourse either with the
indirectness of terror or with the violence of despair These things
none the less her refinements of oddity and intensities of custom her
betrayal at once of conventions and simplicities of ease and of agony
her roundabout retarded suggestions and perceptions still permitted her
to strike her guest as irresistibly charming He didnt know what to
call it she was a fruit of time She had a queer distinction She had
been expensively produced and there would be a good deal more of her to
come

The result of the whole quality of her welcome at any rate was that
the first evening in his room before going to bed he relieved his
mind in a letter to Addie which if space allowed us to embody it in
our text would usefully perform the office of a plate It would
enable us to present ourselves as profusely illustrated But the process
of reproduction as we say costs He wished his friend to know how
grandly their affair turned out She had put him in the way of something
absolutely specialan old house untouched untouchable indescribable
an old corner such as one didnt believe existed and the holy calm of
which made the chatter of studios the smell of paint the slang of
critics the whole sense and sound of Paris come back as so many signs
of a huge monkeycage He moved about restless while he wrote he
lighted cigarettes and nervous and suddenly scrupulous put them out
again the night was mild and one of the windows of his large high room
which stood over the garden was up He lost himself in the things about
him in the type of the room the last century with not a chair moved
not a point stretched He hung over the objects and ornaments
blissfully few and adorably good perfect pieces all and never one for
a change French The scene was as rare as some fine old print with the
best bits down in the corners Old books and old pictures allusions
remembered and aspects conjectured reappeared to him he knew not what
anxious islanders had been trying for in their backward hunt for the
homely But the homely at Flickerbridge was all style even as style at
the same time was mere honesty The larger the smaller pasthe scarce
knew which to call itwas at all events so hushed to sleep round him as
he wrote that he had almost a bad conscience about having come How one
might love it but how one might spoil it To look at it too hard was
positively to make it conscious and to make it conscious was positively
to wake it up Its only safety of a truth was to be left still to
sleepto sleep in its large fair chambers and under its high clean
canopies

He added thus restlessly a line to his letter maundered round the room
again noted and fingered something else and then dropping on the old
flowered sofa sustained by the tight cubes of its cushions yielded
afresh to the cigarette hesitated stared wrote a few words more He
wanted Addie to know that was what he most felt unless he perhaps
felt more how much she herself would want to Yes what he supremely
saw was all that Addie would make of it Up to his neck in it there he
fairly turned cold at the sense of suppressed opportunity of the
outrage of privation that his correspondent would retrospectively and
as he even divined with a vague shudder almost vindictively nurse
Well what had happened was that the acquaintance had been kept for her
like a packet enveloped and sealed for delivery till her attention was
free He saw her there heard her and felt herfelt how she would feel
and how she would as she usually said rave Some of her young
compatriots called it yell and in the reference itself alas
illustrated their meaning She would understand the place at any rate
down to the ground there wasnt the slightest doubt of that Her sense
of it would be exactly like his own and he could see in anticipation
just the terms of recognition and rapture in which she would abound He
knew just what she would call quaint just what she would call bland
just what she would call weird just what she would call wild She would
take it all in with an intelligence much more fitted than his own in
fact to deal with what he supposed he must regard as its literary
relations She would have read the longwinded obsolete memoirs and
novels that both the figures and the setting ought clearly to remind one
of she would know about the past generationsthe lumbering country
magnates and their turbaned wives and roundeyed daughters who in
other days had treated the ruddy sturdy tradeless townthe solid
square houses and wide walled gardens the streets today all grass and
gossip as the scene of a local season She would have warrant for the
assemblies dinners deep potations for the smoked sconces in the dusky
parlours for the long muddy century of family coaches holsters
highwaymen She would put a finger in short just as he had done on the
vital spotthe rich humility of the whole thing the fact that neither
Flickerbridge in general nor Miss Wenham in particular nor anything nor
any one concerned had a suspicion of their characters and their merit
Addie and he would have to come to let in light

He let it in then little by little before going to bed through the
eight or ten pages he addressed to her assured her that it was the
happiest case in the world a little pictureyet full of style
tooabsolutely composed and transmitted with tradition and tradition
only in every stroke tradition still noiselessly breathing and visibly
flushing marking strange hours in the tall mahogany clocks that were
never wound up and that yet audibly ticked on All the elements he was
sure he should see would hang together with a charm presenting his
hostessa strange iridescent fish for the glazed exposure of an
aquariumas afloat in her native medium He left his letter open on the
table but looking it over next morning felt of a sudden indisposed to
send it He would keep it to add more for there would be more to know
yet when three days had elapsed he still had not sent it He sent
instead after delay a much briefer report which he was moved to make
different and for some reason less vivid Meanwhile he learned from
Miss Wenham how Addie had introduced him It took time to arrive with
her at that point but after the Rubicon was crossed they went far
afield




CHAPTER IV


Oh yes she said you were engaged to her That was whysince I HAD
broken outshe thought I might like to see you as I assure you Ive
been so delighted to But ARENT you the good lady asked as if she saw
in his face some ground for doubt

Assuredlyif she says so It may seem very odd to you but I havent
known and yet Ive felt that being nothing whatever to you directly I
need some warrant for consenting thus to be thrust on you We WERE the
young man explained engaged a year ago but since then if you dont
mind my telling you such things I feel now as if I could tell you
anything I havent quite known how I stand It hasnt seemed we were
in a position to marry Things are better now but I havent quite known
how shed see them They were so bad six months ago that I understood
her I thought as breaking off I havent broken Ive only accepted
for the timebecause men must be easy with womenbeing treated as the
best of friends Well I try to be I wouldnt have come here if I
hadnt been I thought it would be charming for her to know youwhen I
heard from her the extraordinary way you had dawned upon her and
charming therefore if I could help her to it And if Im helping you to
know HER he went on isnt that charming too

Oh I so want to Miss Wenham murmured in her unpractical impersonal
way Youre so different she wistfully declared

Its YOU if I may respectfully ecstatically say so who are
different Thats the point of it all Im not sure that anything so
terrible really ought to happen to you as to know us

Well said Miss Wenham I do know you a little by this time dont I
And I dont find it terrible Its a delightful change for me

Oh Im not sure you ought to have a delightful change

Why notif you do

Ah I can bear it Im not sure you can Im too bad to spoilI AM
spoiled Im nobody in short Im nothing Ive no type Youre ALL
type It has taken delicious long years of security and monotony to
produce you You fit your frame with a perfection only equalled by the
perfection with which your frame fits you So this admirable old house
all timesoftened white within and timefaded red without so everything
that surrounds you here and that has by some extraordinary mercy
escaped the inevitable fate of exploitation so it all I say is the
sort of thing that were it the least bit to fall to pieces could
never ah never more be put together again I have dear Miss Wenham
Granger went on happy himself in his extravagance which was yet all
sincere and happier still in her deep but altogether pleased
mystificationIve found do you know just the thing one has ever
heard of that you most resemble Youre the Sleeping Beauty in the
Wood

He still had no compunction when he heard her bewilderedly sigh Oh
youre too delightfully droll

No I only put things just as they are and as Ive also learned a
little thank heaven to see themwhich isnt I quite agree with you
at all what any one does Youre in the deep doze of the spell that has
held you for long years and it would be a shame a crime to wake you
up Indeed I already feel with a thousand scruples that Im giving you
the fatal shake I say it even though it makes me sound a little as if I
thought myself the fairy prince

She gazed at him with her queerest kindest look which he was getting
used to in spite of a faint fear at the back of his head of the
strange things that sometimes occurred when lonely ladies however
mature began to look at interesting young men from over the seas as if
the young men desired to flirt Its so wonderful she said that you
should be so very odd and yet so very goodnatured Well it all came
to the same thingit was so wonderful that SHE should be so simple and
yet so little of a bore He accepted with gratitude the theory of his
languorwhich moreover was real enough and partly perhaps why he was so
sensitive he let himself go as a convalescent let her insist on the
weakness always left by fever It helped him to gain time to preserve
the spell even while he talked of breaking it saw him through slow
strolls and soft sessions long gossips fitful hopeless
questionsthere was so much more to tell than by any contortion she
COULDand explanations addressed gallantly and patiently to her
understanding but not by good fortune really reaching it They were
perfectly at crosspurposes and it was the better and they wandered
together in the silver haze with all communication blurred

When they sat in the sun in her formal garden he quite knew how little
even the tenderest consideration failed to disguise his treating her as
the most exquisite of curiosities The term of comparison most present
to him was that of some obsolete musical instrument The oldtime order
of her mind and her air had the stillness of a painted spinnet that was
duly dusted gently rubbed but never tuned nor played on Her opinions
were like dried roseleaves her attitudes like British sculpture her
voice what he imagined of the possible tone of the old gilded
silverstringed harp in one of the corners of the drawingroom The
lonely little decencies and modest dignities of her life the fine grain
of its conservatism the innocence of its ignorance all its monotony of
stupidity and salubrity its cold dulness and dim brightness were there
before him Meanwhile within him strange things took place It was
literally true that his impression began again after a lull to make
him nervous and anxious and for reasons peculiarly confused almost
grotesquely mingled or at least comically sharp He was distinctly an
agitation and a new tastethat he could see and he saw quite as much
therefore the excitement she already drew from the vision of Addie an
image intensified by the sense of closer kinship and presented to her
clearly with various erratic enhancements by her friend the doctors
daughter At the end of a few days he said to her Do you know she
wants to come without waiting any longer She wants to come while Im
here I received this morning her letter proposing it but Ive been
thinking it over and have waited to speak to you The thing is you see
that if she writes to YOU proposing it

Oh I shall be so particularly glad




CHAPTER V


They were as usual in the garden and it hadnt yet been so present to
him that if he were only a happy cad there would be a good way to
protect her As she wouldnt hear of his being yet beyond precautions
she had gone into the house for a particular shawl that was just the
thing for his knees and blinking in the watery sunshine had come back
with it across the fine little lawn He was neither fatuous nor asinine
but he had almost to put it to himself as a small task to resist the
sense of his absurd advantage with her It filled him with horror and
awkwardness made him think of he didnt know what recalled something
of Maupassantsthe smitten Miss Harriet and her tragic fate There
was a preposterous possibilityyes he held the strings quite in his
handsof keeping the treasure for himself That was the art of
lifewhat the real artist would consistently do He would close the
door on his impression treat it as a private museum He would see that
he could lounge and linger there live with wonderful things there lie
up there to rest and refit For himself he was sure that after a little
he should be able to paint theredo things in a key he had never
thought of before When she brought him the rug he took it from her and
made her sit down on the bench and resume her knitting then passing
behind her with a laugh he placed it over her own shoulders after
which he moved to and fro before her his hands in his pockets and his
cigarette in his teeth He was ashamed of the cigarettea villainous
false note but she allowed liked begged him to smoke and what he
said to her on it in one of the pleasantries she benevolently missed
was that he did so for fear of doing worse That only showed how the end
was really in sight I dare say it will strike you as quite awful what
Im going to say to you but I cant help it I speak out of the depths
of my respect for you It will seem to you horrid disloyalty to poor
Addie Yesthere we are there _I_ am at least in my naked
monstrosity He stopped and looked at her till she might have been
almost frightened Dont let her come Tell her not to Ive tried to
prevent it but she suspects

The poor woman wondered Suspects

Well I drew it in writing to her on reflexion as mild as I
couldhaving been visited in the watches of the night by the instinct
of what might happen Something told me to keep back my first letterin
which under the first impression I myself rashly raved and I
concocted instead of it an insincere and guarded report But guarded as
I was I clearly didnt keep you down as we say enough The wonder of
your colourdaub you over with grey as I mightmust have come through
and told the tale She scents battle from afarby which I mean she
scents quaintness But keep her off Its hideous what Im
sayingbut I owe it to you I owe it to the world Shell kill you

You mean I shant get on with her

Oh fatally See how _I_ have And see how you have with ME Shes
intelligent moreover remarkably pretty remarkably good And shell
adore you

Well then

Why that will be just how shell do for you

Oh I can hold my own said Miss Wenham with the headshake of a horse
making his sleighbells rattle in frosty air

Ah but you cant hold hers Shell rave about you Shell write about
you Youre Niagara before the first white travellerand you know or
rather you cant know what Niagara became AFTER that gentleman Addie
will have discovered Niagara Shell understand you in perfection
shell feel you down to the ground not a delicate shade of you will she
lose or let any one else lose Youll be too weird for words but the
words will nevertheless come Youll be too exactly the real thing and
be left too utterly just as you are and all Addies friends and all
Addies editors and contributors and readers will cross the Atlantic and
flock to Flickerbridge just in order sounanimously universally
vociferouslyto leave you Youll be in the magazines with
illustrations youll be in the papers with headings youll be
everywhere with everything You dont understandyou think you do but
you dont Heaven forbid you SHOULD understand Thats just your
beautyyour sleeping beauty But you neednt You can take me on
trust Dont have her Give as a pretext as a reason anything in the
world you like Lie to herscare her away Ill go away and give you
upIll sacrifice everything myself Granger pursued his exhortation
convincing himself more and more If I saw my way out my way
completely through ID pile up some fabric of fiction for herI should
only want to be sure of its not tumbling down One would have you see
to keep the thing up But Id throw dust in her eyes Id tell her you
dont do at allthat youre not in fact a desirable acquaintance Id
tell her youre vulgar improper scandalous Id tell her youre
mercenary designing dangerous Id tell her the only safe course is
immediately to let you drop Id thus surround you with an impenetrable
legend of conscientious misrepresentation a circle of pious fraud and
all the while privately keep you for myself

She had listened to him as if he were a band of music and she herself a
small shy gardenparty I shouldnt like you to go away I shouldnt in
the least like you not to come again

Ah there it is he replied How can I come again if Addie ruins you

But how will she ruin meeven if she does what you say I know Im too
old to change and really much too queer to please in any of the
extraordinary ways you speak of If its a question of quizzing me I
dont think my cousin or any one else will have quite the hand for it
that YOU seem to have So that if YOU havent ruined me

But I HAVEthats just the point Granger insisted Ive undermined
you at least Ive left after all terribly little for Addie to do

She laughed in clear tones Well then well admit that youve done
everything but frighten me

He looked at her with surpassing gloom Nothat again is one of the
most dreadful features Youll positively like itwhats to come
Youll be caught up in a chariot of fire like the prophetwasnt there
was there oneof old Thats exactly whyif one could but have done
ityoud have been to be kept ignorant and helpless Theres something
or other in Latin that says its the finest things that change the most
easily for the worse You already enjoy your dishonour and revel in your
shame Its too lateyoure lost




CHAPTER VI


All this was as pleasant a manner of passing the time as any other for
it didnt prevent his oldworld corner from closing round him more
entirely nor stand in the way of his making out from day to day some
new source as well as some new effect of its virtue He was really
scared at moments at some of the liberties he took in talkat finding
himself so familiar for the great note of the place was just that a
certain modern ease had never crossed its threshold that quick
intimacies and quick oblivions were a stranger to its air It had known
in all its days no rude no loud invasion Serenely unconscious of most
contemporary things it had been so of nothing so much as of the
diffused social practice of running in and out Granger held his breath
on occasions to think how Addie would run There were moments when more
than at others for some reason he heard her step on the staircase and
her cry in the hall If he nevertheless played freely with the idea with
which we have shown him as occupied it wasnt that in all palpable ways
he didnt sacrifice so far as mortally possible to stillness He only
hovered ever so lightly to take up again his thread She wouldnt hear
of his leaving her of his being in the least fit again as she said to
travel She spoke of the journey to Londonwhich was in fact a matter
of many hoursas an experiment fraught with lurking complications He
added then day to day yet only hereby as he reminded her giving other
complications a larger chance to multiply He kept it before her when
there was nothing else to do that she must consider after which he had
his times of fear that she perhaps really would make for him this
sacrifice

He knew she had written again to Paris and knew he must himself again
writea situation abounding for each in the elements of a plight If he
stayed so long why then he wasnt better and if he wasnt better Addie
might take it into her head They must make it clear that he WAS
better so that suspicious alarmed at what was kept from her she
shouldnt suddenly present herself to nurse him If he was better
however why did he stay so long If he stayed only for the attraction
the sense of the attraction might be contagious This was what finally
grew clearest for him so that he had for his mild disciple hours of
still sharper prophecy It consorted with his fancy to represent to her
that their young friend had been by this time unsparingly warned but
nothing could be plainer than that this was ineffectual so long as he
himself resisted the ordeal To plead that he remained because he was
too weak to move was only to throw themselves back on the other horn of
their dilemma If he was too weak to move Addie would bring him her
strengthof which when she got there she would give them specimens
enough One morning he broke out at breakfast with an intimate
conviction Theyd see that she was actually startingtheyd receive a
wire by noon They didnt receive it but by his theory the portent was
only the stronger It had moreover its grave as well as its gay side
since Grangers paradox and pleasantry were only the method most open to
him of conveying what he felt He literally heard the knell sound and
in expressing this to Miss Wenham with the conversational freedom that
seemed best to pay his way he the more vividly faced the contingency He
could never return and though he announced it with a despair that did
what might be to make it pass as a joke he saw how whether or no she
at last understood she quite at last believed him On this to his
knowledge she wrote again to Addie and the contents of her letter
excited his curiosity But that sentiment though not assuaged quite
dropped when the day after in the evening she let him know she had
had a telegram an hour before

She comes Thursday

He showed not the least surprise It was the deep calm of the fatalist
It HAD to be I must leave you then tomorrow

She looked on this as he had never seen her it would have been hard
to say whether what showed in her face was the last failure to follow or
the first effort to meet And really not to come back

Never never dear lady Why should I come back You can never be again
what you HAVE been I shall have seen the last of you

Oh she touchingly urged

Yes for I should next find you simply brought to selfconsciousness
Youll be exactly what you are I charitably admitnothing more or
less nothing different But youll be it all in a different way We
live in an age of prodigious machinery all organised to a single end
That end is publicitya publicity as ferocious as the appetite of a
cannibal The thing therefore is not to have any illusionsfondly to
flatter yourself in a muddled moment that the cannibal will spare you
He spares nobody He spares nothing It will be all right Youll have a
lovely time Youll be only just a public characterblown about the
world for all youre worth and proclaimed for all youre worth on
the housetops It will be for THAT mind I quite recognisebecause
Addie is superioras well as for all you arent So goodbye

He remained however till the next day and noted at intervals the
different stages of their friends journey the hour this time she
would really have started the hour shed reach Dover the hour shed
get to town where shed alight at Mrs Dunns Perhaps shed bring Mrs
Dunn for Mrs Dunn would swell the chorus At the last on the morrow
as if in anticipation of this stillness settled between them he became
as silent as his hostess But before he went she brought out shyly and
anxiously as an appeal the question that for hours had clearly been
giving her thought Do you meet her then tonight in London

Dear no In what position am I alas to do that When can I EVER meet
her again He had turned it all over If I could meet Addie after
this you know I could meet YOU And if I do meet Addie he lucidly
pursued what will happen by the same stroke is that I SHALL meet you
And thats just what Ive explained to you I dread

You mean she and I will be inseparable

He hesitated I mean shell tell me all about you I can hear her and
her ravings now

She gave againand it was infinitely sadher little whinnying laugh
Oh but if what you say is true youll know

Ah but Addie wont Wont I mean know that _I_ knowor at least
wont believe it Wont believe that any one knows Such he added with
a strange smothered sigh is Addie Do you know he wound up that
what after all has most definitely happened is that youve made me see
her as Ive never done before

She blinked and gasped she wondered and despaired Oh no it will be
YOU Ive had nothing to do with it Everythings all you

But for all it mattered now Youll see he said that shes
charming I shall go for tonight to Oxford I shall almost cross her on
the way

Then if shes charming what am I to tell her from you in explanation of
such strange behaviour as your flying away just as she arrives

Ah you neednt mind about thatyou neednt tell her anything

She fixed him as if as never again Its none of my business of course
I feel but isnt it a little cruel if youre engaged

Granger gave a laugh almost as odd as one of her own Oh youve cost me
thatand he put out his hand to her

She wondered while she took it Cost you

Were not engaged Goodbye




MRS MEDWIN




CHAPTER I


Well we ARE a pair the poor ladys visitor broke out to her at the
end of her explanation in a manner disconcerting enough The poor lady
was Miss Cutter who lived in South Audley Street where she had an
upper half so concise that it had to pass boldly for convenient and
her visitor was her halfbrother whom she hadnt seen for three years
She was remarkable for a maturity of which every symptom might have been
observed to be admirably controlled had not a tendency to stoutness
just affirmed its independence Her present no doubt insisted too much
on her past but with the excuse sufficiently valid that she must
certainly once have been prettier She was clearly not contented with
onceshe wished to be prettier again She neglected nothing that could
produce that illusion and being both fair and fat dressed almost
wholly in black When she added a little colour it was not at any rate
to her drapery Her small rooms had the peculiarity that everything they
contained appeared to testify with vividness to her position in society
quite as if they had been furnished by the bounty of admiring friends
They were adorned indeed almost exclusively with objects that nobody
buys as had more than once been remarked by spectators of her own sex
for herself and would have been luxurious if luxury consisted mainly in
photographic portraits slashed across with signatures in baskets of
flowers beribboned with the cards of passing compatriots and in a neat
collection of red volumes blue volumes alphabetical volumes aids to
London lucidity of every sort devoted to addresses and engagements To
be in Miss Cutters tiny drawingroom in short even with Miss Cutter
aloneshould you by any chance have found her sowas somehow to be in
the world and in a crowd It was like an agencyit bristled with
particulars

This was what the tall lean loose gentleman lounging there before her
might have appeared to read in the suggestive scene over which while
she talked to him his eyes moved without haste and without rest Oh
come Mamie he occasionally threw off and the words were evidently
connected with the impression thus absorbed His comparative youth spoke
of waste even as her positiveher too positivespoke of economy There
was only one thing that is to make up in him for everything he had
lost though it was distinct enough indeed that this thing might
sometimes serve It consisted in the perfection of an indifference an
indifference at the present moment directed to the pleaa plea of
inability of pure destitutionwith which his sister had met him Yet
it had even now a wider embrace took in quite sufficiently all
consequences of queerness confessed in advance to the false note that
in such a setting he almost excruciatingly constituted He cared as
little that he looked at moments all his impudence as that he looked all
his shabbiness all his cleverness all his history These different
things were written in himin his premature baldness his seamed
strained face the lapse from bravery of his long tawny moustache above
all in his easy friendly universally acquainted eye so much too
sociable for mere conversation What possible relation with him could be
natural enough to meet it He wore a scant rough Inverness cape and a
pair of black trousers wanting in substance and marked with the sheen
of time that had presumably once served for evening use He spoke with
the slowness helplessly permitted to Americansas something too slow to
be stoppedand he repeated that he found himself associated with Miss
Cutter in a harmony calling for wonder She had been telling him not
only that she couldnt possibly give him ten pounds but that his
unexpected arrival should he insist on being much in view might
seriously interfere with arrangements necessary to her own maintenance
on which he had begun by replying that he of course knew she had long
ago spent her money but that he looked to her now exactly because she
had without the aid of that convenience mastered the art of life

Id really go away with a fiver my dear if youd only tell me how you
do it Its no use saying only as youve always said that people are
very kind to you What the devil are they kind to you FOR

Well one reason is precisely that no particular inconvenience has
hitherto been supposed to attach to me Im just what I am said Mamie
Cutter nothing less and nothing more Its awkward to have to explain
to you which moreover I really neednt in the least Im clever and
amusing and charming She was uneasy and even frightened but she kept
her temper and met him with a grace of her own I dont think you ought
to ask me more questions than I ask you

Ah my dear said the odd young man IVE no mysteries Why in the
world since it was what you came out for and have devoted so much of
your time to havent you pulled it off Why havent you married

Why havent YOU she retorted Do you think that if I had it would
have been better for youthat my husband would for a moment have put
up with you Do you mind my asking you if youll kindly go NOW she
went on after a glance at the clock Im expecting a friend whom I
must see alone on a matter of great importance

And my being seen with you may compromise your respectability or
undermine your nerve He sprawled imperturbably in his place crossing
again in another sense his long black legs and showing above his low
shoes an absurd reach of particoloured sock I take your point well
enough but maynt you be after all quite wrong If you cant do
anything for me couldnt you at least do something with me If it comes
to that Im clever and amusing and charming too Ive been such an ass
that you dont appreciate me But people like meI assure you they do
They usually dont know what an ass Ive been they only see the
surface whichand he stretched himself afresh as she looked him up
and downyou CAN imagine them cant you rather taken with IM what
I am too nothing less and nothing more Thats true of us as a family
you see We ARE a crew He delivered himself serenely His voice was
soft and flat his pleasant eyes his simple tones tending to the
solemn achieved at moments that effect of quaintness which is in
certain connexions socially so known and enjoyed English people have
quite a weakness for memore than any others I get on with them
beautifully Ive always been with them abroad They think me the
young man explained diabolically American

You Such stupidity drew from her a sigh of compassion

Her companion apparently quite understood it Are you homesick Mamie
he asked with wondering irrelevance

The manner of the question made her for some reason in spite of her
preoccupations break into a laugh A shade of indulgence a sense of
other things came back to her You are funny Scott

Well remarked Scott thats just what I claim But ARE you so
homesick he spaciously inquired not as to a practical end but from
an easy play of intelligence

Im just dying of it said Mamie Cutter

Why so am I Her visitor had a sweetness of concurrence

Were the only decent people Miss Cutter declared And I know You
dontyou cant and I cant explain Come in she continued with a
return of her impatience and an increase of her decision at seven
sharp

She had quitted her seat some time before and now to get him into
motion hovered before him while still motionless he looked up at her
Something intimate in the silence appeared to pass between thema
community of fatigue and failure and after all of intelligence There
was a final cynical humour in it It determined him in any case at
last and he slowly rose taking in again as he stood there the
testimony of the room He might have been counting the photographs but
he looked at the flowers with detachment Whos coming

Mrs Medwin

American

Dear no

Then what are you doing for her

I work for every one she promptly returned

For every one who pays So I suppose Yet isnt it only we who do pay

There was a drollery not lost on her in the way his queer presence
lent itself to his emphasised plural

Do you consider that YOU do

At this with his deliberation he came back to his charming idea
Only try me and see if I cant be MADE to Work me in On her sharply
presenting her back he stared a little at the clock If I come at seven
may I stay to dinner

It brought her round again Impossible Im dining out

With whom

She had to think With Lord Considine

Oh my eye Scott exclaimed

She looked at him gloomily Is THAT sort of tone what makes you pay I
think you might understand she went on that if youre to sponge on
me successfully you mustnt ruin me I must have SOME remote resemblance
to a lady

Yes But why must _I_ Her exasperated silence was full of answers of
which however his inimitable manner took no account You dont
understand my real strength I doubt if you even understand your own
Youre clever Mamie but youre not so clever as I supposed However
he pursued its out of Mrs Medwin that youll get it

Get what

Why the cheque that will enable you to assist me

On this for a moment she met his eyes If youll come back at seven
sharpnot a minute before and not a minute after Ill give you two
fivepound notes

He thought it over Whom are you expecting a minute after

It sent her to the window with a groan almost of anguish and she
answered nothing till she had looked at the street If you injure me
you know Scott youll be sorry

I wouldnt injure you for the world What I want to do in fact is
really to help you and I promise you that I wont leave youby which I
mean wont leave Londontill Ive effected something really pleasant
for you I like you Mamie because I like pluck I like you much more
than you like me I like you very VERY much He had at last with this
reached the door and opened it but he remained with his hand on the
latch What does Mrs Medwin want of you he thus brought out

She had come round to see him disappear and in the relief of this
prospect she again just indulged him

The impossible

He waited another minute And youre going to do it

Im going to do it said Mamie Cutter

Well then that ought to be a haul Call it THREE fivers he laughed
At seven sharp And at last he left her alone




CHAPTER II


Miss Cutter waited till she heard the housedoor close after which in
a sightless mechanical way she moved about the room readjusting various
objects he had not touched It was as if his mere voice and accent had
spoiled her form But she was not left too long to reckon with these
things for Mrs Medwin was promptly announced This lady was not more
than her hostess in the first flush of her youth her appearancethe
scattered remains of beauty manipulated by tasteresembled one of the
light repasts in which the fragments of yesterdays dinner figure with a
conscious ease that makes up for the want of presence She was perhaps
of an effect still too immediate to be called interesting but she was
candid gentle and surprisednot fatiguingly surprised only just in
the right degree and her white faceit was too whitewith the fixed
eyes the somewhat touzled hair and the Louis Seize hat might at the
end of the very long neck have suggested the head of a princess carried
on a pike in a revolution She immediately took up the business that had
brought her with the air however of drawing from the omens then
discernible less confidence than she had hoped The complication lay in
the fact that if it was Mamies part to present the omens that lady yet
had so to colour them as to make her own service large She perhaps
overcoloured for her friend gave way to momentary despair

What you mean is then that its simply impossible

Oh no said Mamie with a qualified emphasis Its POSSIBLE

But disgustingly difficult

As difficult as you like

Then what can I do that I havent done

You can only wait a little longer

But thats just what I HAVE done Ive done nothing else Im always
waiting a little longer

Miss Cutter retained in spite of this pathos her grasp of the subject
THE thing as Ive told you is for you first to be seen

But if people wont look at me

They will

They WILL Mrs Medwin was eager

They shall her hostess went on Its their only having
heardwithout having seen

But if they stare straight the other way Mrs Medwin continued to
object You cant simply go up to them and twist their heads about

Its just what I can said Mamie Cutter

But her charming visitor heedless for the moment of this attenuation
had found the way to put it Its the old story You cant go into the
water till you swim and you cant swim till you go into the water I
cant be spoken to till Im seen but I cant be seen till Im spoken
to

She met this lucidity Miss Cutter with but an instants lapse You
say I cant twist their heads about But I HAVE twisted them

It had been quietly produced but it gave her companion a jerk They
say Yes

She summed it up All but one SHE says No

Mrs Medwin thought then jumped Lady Wantridge

Miss Cutter as more delicate only bowed admission I shall see her
either this afternoon or late tomorrow But she has written

Her visitor wondered again May I see her letter

No She spoke with decision But I shall square her

Then how

Welland Miss Cutter as if looking upward for inspiration fixed her
eyes a while on the ceilingwell it will come to me

Mrs Medwin watched herit was impressive And will they come to
youthe others This question drew out the fact that they wouldso
far at least as they consisted of Lady Edward Lady Bellhouse and Mrs
Pouncer who had engaged to muster at the signal of tea on the
14thprepared as it were for the worst There was of course always
the chance that Lady Wantridge might take the field in such force as to
paralyse them though that danger at the same time seemed inconsistent
with her being squared It didnt perhaps all quite ideally hang
together but what it sufficiently came to was that if she was the one
who could do most FOR a person in Mrs Medwins position she was also
the one who could do most against It would therefore be distinctly what
our friend familiarly spoke of as collarwork The effect of these
mixed considerations was at any rate that Mamie eventually acquiesced in
the idea handsomely thrown out by her client that she should have an
advance to go on with Miss Cutter confessed that it seemed at times
as if one scarce COULD go on but the advance was in spite of this
delicacy still more delicately mademade in the form of a banknote
several sovereigns some loose silver and two coppers the whole
contents of her purse neatly disposed by Mrs Medwin on one of the tiny
tables It seemed to clear the air for deeper intimacies the fruit of
which was that Mamie lonely after all in her crowd and always more
helpful than helped eventually brought out that the way Scott had been
going on was what seemed momentarily to overshadow her own power to do
so

Ive had a descent from him But she had to explain My
halfbrotherScott Homer A wretch

What kind of a wretch

Every kind I lose sight of him at timeshe disappears abroad But he
always turns up again worse than ever

Violent

No

Maudlin

No

Only unpleasant

No Rather pleasant Awfully cleverawfully travelled and easy

Then whats the matter with him

Mamie mused hesitatedseemed to see a wide past I dont know

Something in the background Then as her friend was silent Something
queer about cards Mrs Medwin threw off

I dont knowand I dont want to

Ah well Im sure _I_ dont Mrs Medwin returned with spirit The
note of sharpness was perhaps also a little in the observation she made
as she gathered herself to go Do you mind my saying something

Mamie took her eyes quickly from the money on the little stand You may
say what you like

I only mean that anything awkward you may have to keep out of the way
does seem to make more wonderful doesnt it that you should have got
just where you are I allude you know to your position

I see Miss Cutter somewhat coldly smiled To my power

So awfully remarkable in an American

Ah you like us so

Mrs Medwin candidly considered But we dont dearest

Her companions smile brightened Then why do you come to me

Oh I like YOU Mrs Medwin made out

Then thats it There are no Americans Its always you

Me Mrs Medwin looked lovely but a little muddled

ME Mamie Cutter laughed But if you like me you dear thing you can
judge if I like YOU She gave her a kiss to dismiss her Ill see you
again when Ive seen her

Lady Wantridge I hope so indeed Ill turn up late tomorrow if you
dont catch me first Has it come to you yet the visitor now at the
door went on

No but it will Theres time

Oh a little less every day

Miss Cutter had approached the table and glanced again at the gold and
silver and the note not indeed absolutely overlooking the two coppers
The balance she put it the day after

That very night if you like

Then count on me

Oh if I didnt But the door closed on the dark idea Yearningly
then and only when it had done so Miss Cutter took up the money

She went out with it ten minutes later and the calls on her time being
many remained out so long that at halfpast six she hadnt come back
At that hour on the other hand Scott Homer knocked at her door where
her maid who opened it with a weak pretence of holding it firm
ventured to announce to him as a lesson well learnt that he hadnt
been expected till seven No lesson none the less could prevail
against his native art He pleaded fatigue her the maids dreadful
depressing London and the need to curl up somewhere If shed just
leave him quiet half an hour that old sofa upstairs would do for it of
which he took quickly such effectual possession that when five minutes
later she peeped nervous for her broken vow into the drawingroom the
faithless young woman found him extended at his length and peacefully
asleep




CHAPTER III


The situation before Miss Cutters return developed in other directions
still and when that event took place at a few minutes past seven
these circumstances were by the foot of the stair between mistress and
maid the subject of some interrogative gasps and scared admissions
Lady Wantridge had arrived shortly after the interloper and wishing as
she said to wait had gone straight up in spite of being told he was
lying down

She distinctly understood he was there

Oh yes maam I thought it right to mention

And what did you call him

Well maam I thought it unfair to YOU to call him anything but a
gentleman

Mamie took it all in though there might well be more of it than one
could quickly embrace But if she has had time she flashed to find
out he isnt one

Oh maam she had a quarter of an hour

Then she isnt with him still

No maam she came down again at last She rang and I saw her here
and she said she wouldnt wait longer

Miss Cutter darkly mused Yet had already waited

Quite a quarter

Mercy on us She began to mount Before reaching the top however she
had reflected that quite a quarter was long if Lady Wantridge had only
been shocked On the other hand it was short if she had only been
pleased But how COULD she have been pleased The very essence of their
actual crisis was just that there was no pleasing her Mamie had but to
open the drawingroom door indeed to perceive that this was not true at
least of Scott Homer who was horribly cheerful

Miss Cutter expressed to her brother without reserve her sense of the
constitutional the brutal selfishness that had determined his mistimed
return It had taken place in violation of their agreement exactly at
the moment when it was most cruel to her that he should be there and if
she must now completely wash her hands of him he had only himself to
thank She had come in flushed with resentment and for a moment had been
voluble but it would have been striking that though the way he
received her might have seemed but to aggravate it presently justified
him by causing their relation really to take a stride He had the art of
confounding those who would quarrel with him by reducing them to the
humiliation of a stirred curiosity

What COULD she have made of you Mamie demanded

My dear girl shes not a woman whos eager to make too much of
anythinganything I mean that will prevent her from doing as she
likes what she takes into her head Of course he continued to
explain if its something she doesnt want to do shell make as much
as Moses

Mamie wondered if that was the way he talked to her visitor but felt
obliged to own to his acuteness It was an exact description of Lady
Wantridge and she was conscious of tucking it away for future use in a
corner of her miscellaneous little mind She withheld however all
present acknowledgment only addressing him another question Did you
really get on with her

Have you still to learn darlingI cant help again putting it to
youthat I get on with everybody Thats just what I dont seem able to
drive into you Only see how I get on with YOU

She almost stood corrected What I mean is of course whether

Whether she made love to me Shyly yetor becauseshamefully She
would certainly have liked awfully to stay

Then why didnt she

Because on account of some other matterand I could see it was
trueshe hadnt time Twenty minutesshe was here lesswere all she
came to give you So dont be afraid Ive frightened her away Shell
come back

Mamie thought it over Yet you didnt go with her to the door

She wouldnt let me and I know when to do what Im toldquite as much
as what Im not told She wanted to find out about me I mean from your
little creature a pearl of fidelity by the way

But what on earth did she come up for Mamie again found herself
appealing and just by that fact showing her need of help

Because she always goes up Then as in the presence of this rapid
generalisation to say nothing of that of such a relative altogether
Miss Cutter could only show as comparatively blank I mean she knows
when to go up and when to come down She has instincts she didnt know
whom you might have up here Its a kind of compliment to you anyway
Why Mamie Scott pursued you dont know the curiosity we any of us
inspire You wouldnt believe what Ive seen The bigger bugs they are
the more theyre on the lookout

Mamie still followed but at a distance The lookout for what

Why for anything that will help them to live Youve been here all this
time without making out then about them what Ive had to pick out as I
can Theyre dead dont you see And WERE alive

You OhMamie almost laughed about it

Well theyre a wornout old lot anyhow theyve used up their
resources They do look out and Ill do them the justice to say theyre
not afraidnot even of me he continued as his sister again showed
something of the same irony Lady Wantridge at any rate wasnt thats
what I mean by her having made love to me She does what she likes Mind
it you know He was by this time fairly teaching her to read one of
her best friends and when after it he had come back to the great
point of his lessonthat of her failure through feminine inferiority
practically to grasp the truth that their being just as they were he
and she was the real card for them to playwhen he had renewed that
reminder he left her absolutely in a state of dependence Her impulse to
press him on the subject of Lady Wantridge dropped it was as if she had
felt that whatever had taken place something would somehow come of it
She was to be in a manner disappointed but the impression helped to
keep her over to the next morning when as Scott had foretold his new
acquaintance did reappear explaining to Miss Cutter that she had acted
the day before to gain time and that she even now sought to gain it by
not waiting longer What she promptly intimated she had asked herself
could that friend be thinking of She must show where she stood before
things had gone too far If she had brought her answer without more
delay she wished to make it sharp Mrs Medwin Never No my dearnot
I THERE I stop

Mamie had known it would be collarwork but somehow now at the
beginning she felt her heart sink It was not that she had expected to
carry the position with a rush but that as always after an interval
her visitors defences really loomedand quite as it were to the
material visiontoo large She was always planted with them
voluminous in the very centre of the passage was like a person
accommodated with a chair in some unlawful place at the theatre She
wouldnt move and you couldnt get round Mamies calculation indeed had
not been on getting round she was obliged to recognise that too
foolishly and fondly she had dreamed of inducing a surrender Her dream
had been the fruit of her need but conscious that she was even yet
unequipped for pressure she felt almost for the first time in her
life superficial and crude She was to be paidbut with what was she
to that end to pay She had engaged to find an answer to this question
but the answer had not according to her promise come And Lady
Wantridge meanwhile massed herself and there was no view of her that
didnt show her as verily by some process too obscure to be traced the
hard depository of the social law She was no younger no fresher no
stronger really than any of them she was only with a kind of haggard
fineness a sharpened taste for life and with all sorts of things
behind and beneath her more abysmal and more immoral more secure and
more impertinent The points she made were two in number One was that
she absolutely declined the other was that she quite doubted if Mamie
herself had measured the job The thing couldnt be done But say it
COULD be was Mamie quite the person to do it To this Miss Cutter with
a sweet smile replied that she quite understood how little she might
seem so Im only one of the persons to whom it has appeared that YOU
are

Then who are the others

Well to begin with Lady Edward Lady Bellhouse and Mrs Pouncer

Do you mean that theyll come to meet her

Ive seen them and theyve promised

To come of course Lady Wantridge said if _I_ come

Her hostess cast about Oh of course you could prevent them But I
should take it as awfully kind of you not to WONT you do this for me
Mamie pleaded

Her friend looked over the room very much as Scott had done Do they
really understand what its FOR

Perfectly So that she may call

And what good will that do her

Miss Cutter faltered but she presently brought it out Naturally what
one hopes is that youll ask her

Ask her to call

Ask her to dine Ask her if youd be so truly sweet for a Sunday or
something of that sort and even if only in one of your MOST mixed
parties to Catchmore

Miss Cutter felt the less hopeful after this effort in that her
companion only showed a strange good nature And it wasnt a satiric
amiability though it WAS amusement Take Mrs Medwin into my family

Some day when youre taking forty others

Ah but what I dont see is what it does for YOU Youre already so
welcome among us that you can scarcely improve your position even by
forming for us the most delightful relation

Well I know how dear you are Mamie Cutter replied but one has
after all more than one side and more than one sympathy I like her you
know And even at this Lady Wantridge wasnt shocked she showed that
ease and blandness which were her way unfortunately of being most
impossible She remarked that SHE might listen to such things because
she was clever enough for them not to matter only Mamie should take
care how she went about saying them at large When she became definite
however in a minute on the subject of the public facts Miss Cutter
soon found herself ready to make her own concession Of course she
didnt dispute THEM there they were they were unfortunately on record
and nothing was to be done about them but toMamie found it in truth
at this point a little difficult

Well what Pretend already to have forgotten them

Why not when youve done it in so many other cases

There ARE no other cases so bad One meets them at any rate as they
come Some you can manage others you cant Its no use you must give
them up Theyre past patching theres nothing to be done with them
Theres nothing accordingly to be done with Mrs Medwin but to put her
off And Lady Wantridge rose to her height

Well you know I DO do things Mamie quavered with a smile so
strained that it partook of exaltation

You help people Oh yes Ive known you to do wonders But stick said
Lady Wantridge with strong and cheerful emphasis to your Americans

Miss Cutter gazing got up You dont do justice Lady Wantridge to
your own compatriots Some of them are really charming Besides said
Mamie working for mine often strikes me so far as the interestthe
inspiration and excitement dont you knowgo as rather too easy You
all as I constantly have occasion to say like us so

Her companion frankly weighed it Yes it takes that to account for
your position Ive always thought of you nevertheless as keeping for
their benefit a regular working agency They come to you and you place
them There remains I confess her ladyship went on in the same free
spirit the great wonder

Of how I first placed my poor little self Yes Mamie bravely
conceded when _I_ began there was no agency I just worked my passage
I didnt even come to YOU did I You never noticed me till as Mrs
Short Stokes says I was way way up Mrs Medwin she threw in
cant get over it Then as her friend looked vague Over my social
situation

Well its no great flattery to you to say Lady Wantridge
goodhumouredly returned that she certainly cant hope for one
resembling it Yet it really seemed to spread there before them You
simply MADE Mrs Short Stokes

In spite of her name Mamie smiled

Oh your names In spite of everything

Ah Im something of an artist With which and a relapse marked by her
wistful eyes into the gravity of the matter she supremely fixed her
friend She felt how little she minded betraying at last the extremity
of her need and it was out of this extremity that her appeal proceeded
Have I really had your last word It means so much to me

Lady Wantridge came straight to the point You mean you depend on it

Awfully

Is it all you have

All Now

But Mrs Short Stokes and the othersrolling arent they Dont
they pay up

Ah sighed Mamie if it wasnt for THEM

Lady Wantridge perceived Youve had so much

I couldnt have gone on

Then what do you do with it all

Oh most of it goes back to them There are all sorts and its all
help Some of them have nothing

Oh if you feed the hungry Lady Wantridge laughed youre indeed in a
great way of business Is Mrs Medwinher transition was
immediatereally rich

Really He left her everything

So that if I do say yes

It will quite set me up

I seeand how much more responsible it makes one But Id rather
myself give you the money

Oh Mamie coldly murmured

You mean I maynt suspect your prices Well I daresay I dont But Id
rather give you ten pounds

Oh Mamie repeated in a tone that sufficiently covered her prices The
question was in every way larger Do you never forgive she
reproachfully inquired The door opened however at the moment she spoke
and Scott Homer presented himself




CHAPTER IV


Scott Homer wore exactly to his sisters eyes the aspect he had worn
the day before and it also formed to her sense the great feature of his
impartial greeting

How dye do Mamie How dye do Lady Wantridge

How dye do again Lady Wantridge replied with an equanimity striking
to her hostess It was as if Scotts own had been contagious it was
almost indeed as if she had seen him before Had she ever so seen
himbefore the previous day While Miss Cutter put to herself this
question her visitor at all events met the one she had previously
uttered Ever forgive this personage echoed in a tone that made as
little account as possible of the interruption Dear yes The people I
HAVE forgiven She laughedperhaps a little nervously and she was now
looking at Scott The way she looked at him was precisely what had
already had its effect for his sister The people I can

Can you forgive me asked Scott Homer

She took it so easily Butwhat

Mamie interposed she turned directly to her brother Dont try her
Leave it so She had had an inspiration it was the most extraordinary
thing in the world Dont try HIMshe had turned to their companion
She looked grave sad strange Leave it so Yes it was a distinct
inspiration which she couldnt have explained but which had come
prompted by something she had caughtthe extent of the recognition
expressedin Lady Wantridges face It had come absolutely of a sudden
straight out of the opposition of the two figures before herquite as
if a concussion had struck a light The light was helped by her
quickened sense that her friends silence on the incident of the day
before showed some sort of consciousness She looked surprised Do you
know my brother

DO I know you Lady Wantridge asked of him

No Lady Wantridge Scott pleasantly confessed not one little mite

Well then if you MUST go and Mamie offered her a hand But Ill go
down with you NOT YOU she launched at her brother who immediately
effaced himself His way of doing soand he had already done so as for
Lady Wantridge in respect to their previous encounterstruck her even
at the moment as an instinctive if slightly blind tribute to her
possession of an idea and as such in its celerity made her so admire
him and their common wit that she on the spot more than forgave him
his queerness He was right He could be as queer as he liked The
queerer the better It was at the foot of the stairs when she had got
her guest down that what she had assured Mrs Medwin would come did
indeed come DID you meet him here yesterday

Dear yes Isnt he too funny

Yes said Mamie gloomily He IS funny But had you ever met him
before

Dear no

Ohand Mamies tone might have meant many things

Lady Wantridge however after all easily overlooked it I only knew he
was one of your odd Americans Thats why when I heard yesterday here
that he was up there awaiting your return I didnt let that prevent me
I thought he might be He certainly her ladyship laughed IS

Yes hes very American Mamie went on in the same way

As you say we ARE fond of you Goodbye said Lady Wantridge

But Mamie had not half done with her She felt more and moreor she
hoped at leastthat she looked strange She WAS no doubt if it came
to that strange Lady Wantridge she almost convulsively broke out
I dont know whether youll understand me but I seem to feel that I
must act with youI dont know what to call itresponsibly He IS my
brother

Surelyand why not Lady Wantridge stared Hes the image of you

Thank youand Mamie was stranger than ever

Oh hes goodlooking Hes handsome my dear Oddlybut distinctly
Her ladyship was for treating it much as a joke

But Mamie all sombre would have none of this She boldly gave him up
I think hes awful

He is indeeddelightfully And where DO you get your ways of saying
things It isnt anythingand the things arent anything But its so
droll

Dont let yourself all the same Mamie consistently pursued be
carried away by it The thing cant be donesimply

Lady Wantridge wondered Done simply

Done at all

But what cant be

Why what you might thinkfrom his pleasantness What he spoke of your
doing for him

Lady Wantridge recalled Forgiving him

He asked you if you couldnt But you cant Its too dreadful for me
as so near a relation to have loyallyloyally to YOUto say it But
hes impossible

It was so portentously produced that her ladyship had somehow to meet
it Whats the matter with him

I dont know

Then whats the matter with YOU Lady Wantridge inquired

Its because I WONT know Mamienot without dignityexplained

Then _I_ wont either

Precisely Dont Its something Mamie pursued with some
inconsequence thatsomewhere or other at some time or otherhe
appears to have done Something that has made a difference in his life

Something Lady Wantridge echoed again What kind of thing

Mamie looked up at the light above the door through which the London
sky was doubly dim I havent the least idea

Then what kind of difference

Mamies gaze was still at the light The difference you see

Lady Wantridge rather obligingly seemed to ask herself what she saw
But I dont see any It seems at least she added such an amusing
one And he has such nice eyes

Oh DEAR eyes Mamie conceded but with too much sadness for the
moment about the connexions of the subject to say more

It almost forced her companion after an instant to proceed Do you mean
he cant go home

She weighed her responsibility I only make outmores the pitythat
he doesnt

Is it then something too terrible

She thought again I dont know whatfor menIS too terrible

Well then as you dont know what is for women eithergoodbye her
visitor laughed

It practically wound up the interview which however terminating thus
on a considerable stir of the air was to give Miss Cutter for several
days the sense of being much blown about The degree to which to begin
with she had been drawnor perhaps rather pushedcloser to Scott was
marked in the brief colloquy that she on her friends departure had with
him He had immediately said it Youll see if she doesnt ask me
down

So soon

Oh Ive known them at placesat Cannes at Pau at Shanghaido it
sooner still I always know when they will You CANT make out they
dont love me He spoke almost plaintively as if he wished she could

Then I dont see why it hasnt done you more good

Why Mamie he patiently reasoned what more good COULD it As I tell
you he explained it has just been my life

Then why do you come to me for money

Oh they dont give me THAT Scott returned

So that it only means then after all that I at the best must keep
you up

He fixed on her the nice eyes Lady Wantridge admired Do you mean to
tell me that alreadyat this very momentIm not distinctly keeping
you

She gave him back his look Wait till she HAS asked you and then
Mamie added decline

Scott not too grossly wondered As acting for YOU

Mamies next injunction was answer enough But BEFOREyescall

He took it in Callbut decline Good

The rest she said I leave to you And she left it in fact with
such confidence that for a couple of days she was not only conscious of
no need to give Mrs Medwin another turn of the screw but positively
evaded in her fortitude the reappearance of that lady It was not till
the fourth day that she waited upon her finding her as she had
expected tense

Lady Wantridge WILL

Yes though she says she wont

She says she wont Ooh Mrs Medwin moaned

Sit tight all the same I HAVE her

But how

Through Scottwhom she wants

Your bad brother Mrs Medwin stared What does she want of him

To amuse them at Catchmore Anything for that And he WOULD But he
shant Mamie declared He shant go unless she comes She must meet
you firstyoure my condition

Oooh Mrs Medwins tone was a wonder of hope and fear But doesnt
he want to go

He wants what I want She draws the line at YOU I draw the line at
HIM

But SHEdoesnt she mind that hes bad

It was so artless that Mamie laughed Noit doesnt touch her
Besides perhaps he isnt It isnt as for youpeople seem not to know
He has settled everything at all events by going to see her Its
before her that hes the thing shell have to have

Have to

For Sundays in the country A featureTHE feature

So she has asked him

Yesand he has declined

For ME Mrs Medwin panted

For me said Mamie on the doorstep But I dont leave him for long
Her hansom had waited Shell come

Lady Wantridge did come She met in South Audley Street on the
fourteenth at tea the ladies whom Mamie had named to her together
with three or four others and it was rather a masterstroke for Miss
Cutter that if Mrs Medwin was modestly present Scott Homer was as
markedly not This occasion however is a medal that would take rare
casting as would also for that matter even the minor light and shade
the lower relief of the pecuniary transaction that Mrs Medwins
flushed gratitude scarce awaited the dispersal of the company
munificently to complete A new understanding indeed on the spot
rebounded from it the conception of which in Mamies mind had
promptly bloomed He shant go now unless he takes you Then as her
fancy always moved quicker for her client than her clients ownDown
with him to Catchmore When he goes to amuse them YOU she serenely
developed shall amuse them too Mrs Medwins response was again
rather oddly divided but she was sufficiently intelligible when it came
to meeting the hint that this latter provision would represent success
to the tune of a separate fee Say Mamie had suggested the same

Very well the same

The knowledge that it was to be the same had perhaps something to do
also with the obliging spirit in which Scott eventually went It was all
at the last rather hurrieda party rapidly got together for the Grand
Duke who was in England but for the hour who had goodnaturedly
proposed himself and who liked his parties small intimate and funny
This one was of the smallest and was finally judged to conform neither
too little nor too much to the other conditionsafter a brief whirlwind
of wires and counterwires and an iterated waiting of hansoms at various
doorsto include Mrs Medwin It was from Catchmore itself that
snatching a momenton the wondrous Sunday afternoon this lady had the
harmonious thought of sending the new cheque She was in bliss enough
but her scribble none the less intimated that it was Scott who amused
them most He WAS the feature
