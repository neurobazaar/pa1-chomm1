Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000
If they reach just 12 of the worlds population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by years end

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only about 4 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding

MR BONAPARTE OF CORSICA

by John Kendrick Bangs




CHAPTER I CORSICA TO BRIENNE
17691779



Napoleons father Charles Bonaparte was the honored progenitor of
thirteen children of whom the man who subsequently became the
Emperor of the French by some curious provision of fate was the
second That the infant Napoleon should have followed rather than
led the procession is so foreign to the nature of the man that many
worthy persons unfamiliar with the true facts of history have
believed that Joseph was a purely apocryphal infant or as some have
suggested merely an adopted child but that Napoleon did upon this
occasion content himself with second place is an incontrovertible
fact Nor is it entirely unaccountable It is hardly to be supposed
that a true military genius such as Napoleon is universally conceded
to have been would plunge into the midst of a great battle without
first having acquainted himself with the possibilities of the future
A reconnoitre of the field of action is the first duty of a
successful commander and hence it was that Napoleon not wishing to
rush wholly unprepared into the battle of life assigned to his
brother Joseph the arduous task of first entering into the world to
see how the land lay Joseph having found everything to his
satisfaction Napoleon made his appearance in the little island of
Corsica recently come under French domination the 15th day August
1769 Had he been born two months earlier we are told he would
have been an Italian Had he been born a hundred years later it is
difficult to say what he would have been As it was he was born a
Frenchman It is not pleasant to contemplate what the mans future
would have been had he been born an Italian nor is it easy to
picture that future with any confidence born of certainty Since the
days of Caesar Italy had not produced any great military commander
and it is not likely that the powers would have changed their scheme
confirmed by sixteen centuries of observance in Napoleons behalfa
fact which Napoleon himself realized for he often said in his latter
days with a shudder I hate to think how inglorious I should have
become had I been born two months earlier and entered the world as an
Italian I should have been another Josephnot that Joseph is not a
good man but he is not a great man Ah Bourrienne we cannot be
too careful in the selection of our birthdays

It is the testimony of all who knew him in his infancy that Napoleon
was a good child He was obedient and respectful to his mother and
sometimes at night when on account of some indigestible quality of
his food or other cause it was necessary for his father to make a
series of forced marches up and down the spacious nursery in the
beautiful home at Ajaccio holding the infant warrior in his arms
certain premonitions of his sons future career dawned upon the
parent His anguish was voiced in commanding tones his wails like
his subsequent addresses to his soldiers were short sharp clear
and decisive nor would he brook the slightest halt in these midnight
marches until the difficulties which stood in his path had been
overcome His confidence in himself at this early period was
remarkable Quick to make up his mind he was tenacious of his
purpose to the very end

It is related that when barely seven months old while sitting in his
nurses lap by means of signs which she could not fail to
comprehend he expressed the desire which indeed is characteristic
of most healthy Children of that age to possess the whole of the
outside world not to mention the moon and other celestial bodies
Reaching his little hands out in the direction of the Continent
lying not far distant over the waters of the Mediterranean he made
this demand and while of course his desire was not granted upon
the instant it is the testimony of history that he never lost sight
of that cherished object

After providing Napoleon with eleven other brothers and sisters
Charles Bonaparte died and left his good and faithful wife Letitia
to care for the future greatness of his family a task rendered
somewhat the more arduous than it might otherwise have been by the
lack of income but the good woman who had much of Napoleons nature
in her makeup was equal to the occasion She had her sons to help
her and was constantly buoyed up by the expressed determination of
her second child to place her beyond the reach of want in that future
day when the whole world lay grovelling at his feet

Do not worry mother Napoleon said Let Joseph and Lucien and
Louis and Jerome and the girls be educated as for me I can take
care of myself I who at the age of three have mastered the Italian
language have a future before me I will go to France and then

Well what then his mother asked

Nous verrons Napoleon replied turning on his heel and walking out
of the house whistling a military march

From this it will be seen that even in his in fancy Napoleon had his
ideas as to his future course Another anecdote which is taken from
the unpublished memoirs of the grandson of one of his Corsican
nurses illustrates in an equally vivid manner how while a mere
infant in arms he had a passion for and a knowledge of military
terms Early one morning the silence was broken by the incipient
Emperor calling loudly for assistance His nurse rushing to him
discovered that the point of a pin was sticking into his back
Hastily removing the cause of the disturbance she endeavored to
comfort him

Never mind sweetheart she said its only a nasty pin

Nasty pin roared Napoleon By the revered name of Paoli I swear
I thought it was a bayonet

It was no doubt this early realization of the conspicuous part he
was to play in the history of his time that made the youthful
Bonaparte reserved of manner gloomy and taciturn and prone to
irritability He felt within him the germ of future greatness and
so became impatient of restraint He completely dominated the
household Joseph his elder brother became entirely subject to the
imperious will of the future Emperor and when in fancy Napoleon
dreamed of those battles to come Joseph was always summoned to take
an active part in the imaginary fight Now he was the bridge of
Lodi and lying flat on his back was forced to permit his
bloodthirsty brother to gallop across him shouting words of
inspiration to a band of imaginary followers again he was forced to
pose as a snowclad Alp for Napoleon to climb followed laboriously
by Lucien and Jerome and the other children It cannot be supposed
that this was always pleasing to Joseph but he never faltered when
the demand was made that he should act because he did not dare

You bring up the girls mother Napoleon had said Leave the boys
to me and Ill make kings of them all if I have to send them over to
the United States where all men will soon be potentates and their
rulers merely servantschosen to do their bidding

Once Joseph venturing to assert himself as the eldest son Napoleon
smiled grimly

And what pray does that mean he asked scornfully

That I and not you am the head of the family replied Joseph

Very well said Napoleon rushing behind him and by a rapidly
conceived flank movement giving Joseph a good sound kick How does
the head of the family like the foot of the family Dont ever prate
of accidents of birth to me

From that time on Joseph never murmured again but obeyed blindly his
brothers slightest behest He would have permitted Napoleon to mow
him down with grapeshot without complaint rather than rebel and
incur the wrath which he knew would then fall upon his head

At school the same defiance of restraint and contempt for superior
strength characterized Napoleon Here too his taciturn nature
helped him much If he were asked a question which he could not
answer he would decline to speak so that his instructors were
unable to state whether or not he was in ignorance as to the point
under discussion and could mark him down conscientiously as
contumelious only Hence it was that he stood well in his studies
but was never remarkable for deportment His favorite plaything
barring his brother Joseph was a small brass cannon that weighed
some thirty odd pounds and which is still to be seen on the island
of Corsica Of this he once said Id rather hear its report than
listen to a German band though if I could get them both playing at
the same time thered be one German band less in the world

This remark found its parallel later on when placed by Barras in
command of the defenders of the Convention against the attacks of the
Sectionists Napoleon was asked the chairman of the Assembly to send
them occasional reports as to how matters progressed His reply was
terse

Legislators he said you ask me for an occasional report If you
listen you will hear the report of my cannon That is all youll
get and it will be all you need I am here I will save you

It is a poor time for jokes said a representative

It is a worse time for paper reports retorted Napoleon It would
take me longer to write out a legislative report than it will to
clean out the mob Besides I want it understood at this end of my
career that autographhunters are going to get left

As he turned Barras asked him as to his intentions

Where are you going he asked

To make a noise in the world cried Napoleon au revoir

That he had implanted in him the essential elements of a great
fighter his schoolcompanions were not long in finding out

When not more than five years of age he fell in love with a little
schoolmate and being jeered at for his openly avowed sentiments he
threatened to thrash the whole school adding to the little maiden
that he would thrash her as well unless she returned his love a line
of argument which completely won her heart particularly in view of
the fact that he proved his sincerity by fulfilling that part of his
assumed obligations which referred to the subjugation of the rest of
the school It was upon this occasion that in reference to his
carelessness of dress his schoolmates composed the rhyme


Napoleon di mezza calzetta
Fa lamore a Giacominetta


which liberally translated means


Hi Look at Nap His socks down of his shin
Is making love to little Giacomin


To this Napoleon on the authority of the Memoirs of his Fathers
Hired Man retorted


I would advise you be not indiscreet
Or I will yank YOUR socks right of your feet


All of which goes to show that at no time in his youth was he to be
trifled with In poetry or a pitched battle he was quite equal to
any emergency and his companions were not long in finding it out

So passed the infancy of Mr Bonaparte of Corsica It was after
all much like the extreme youth of most other children In
everything he undertook he was facile princeps and in nothing that
he said or did is there evidence that he failed to appreciate what
lay before him A visitor to the family once ventured the remark I
am sorry Napoleon for you little Corsicans You have no Fourth of
July or Guy Fawkes Day to celebrate

Oh as for that said Napoleon I for one do not mind I will
make national holidays when I get to be a man and at present I can
get along without them Whats the use of Fourth of July when you
can shoot off fireworks everyday

It was a pertinent question the visitor departed much impressed with
the boys precocity which was rendered doubly memorable by
Napoleons humor in discharging fifteen pounds of wadding from his
cannon into the visitors back as he went out of the front gate

At the age of six Napoleon put aside all infantile pleasures and at
eight assumed all the dignity of that age He announced his
intention to cease playing war with his brother Joseph

I am no longer a child Joseph he said I shall no longer thrash
you in play Hereafter I shall do it in sober earnest

Which no doubt is why in 1779 Napoleon having stuck faithfully to
his promise Joseph heartily seconded his younger brothers demand
that he should leave Corsica and take a course of military
instruction at Brienne

I shall no doubt miss my dear brother Napoleon Joseph said to his
mother but I would not stand in the way of his advancement Let
him go even though by his departure I am deprived of all opportunity
to assist him in his pleasing games of war



CHAPTER II BRIENNE
17791785



As we have seen the young Corsican was only ten years of age when
through the influence of Count Marboeuf an old friend of the
Bonaparte family he was admitted to the military school at Brienne
Those who were present at the hour of his departure from home say
that Napoleon would have wept like any other child had he yielded to
the impulses of his heart and had be not detected a smile of
satisfaction upon the lips of his brother Joseph It was this smile
that drove all tender emotions from his breast Taking Joseph to one
side he requested to know the cause of his mirth

I was thinking of something funny said Joseph paling slightly as
he observed the stern expression of Napoleons face

Oh indeed said Napoleon and what was that something Id like
to smile myself

Hmahwhy faltered Joseph it may not strike you as funny
you know What is a joke for one man is apt to be a serious matter
for another particularly when that other is of a taciturn and
irritable disposition

Very likely said Napoleon dryly and sometimes what is a joke
for the man of mirth is likewise in the end a serious matter for that
same humorous person This may turn out to be the case in the
present emergency What was the joke If I do not find it a
humorous joke Ill give you a parting caress which you wont forget
in a hurry

I was only thinking said Joseph uneasily that it is a very good
thing for that little ferryboat you are going away on that you are
going on it

Here Joseph smiled weakly but Napoleon was grim as ever

Well he said impatiently what of that

Why returned Joseph it seemed to me that such a tireless little
worker as the boat is would find it very restful to take a Nap

For an instant Napoleon was silent

Joseph said he as he gazed solemnly out of the window I thank
you from the bottom of my heart for this I had had regrets at
leaving home A moment ago I was ready to break down for the sorrow
of parting from my favorite Alp from my home from my mother and my
little brass cannon but nownow I can go with a heart steeled
against emotion If you are going in for humor of that kind Im
glad Im going away Farewell

With this picking Joseph up in his arms and concealing him beneath
the sofa cushions Napoleon imprinted a kiss upon his mothers cheek
rushed aboard the craft that was to bear him to fame and was soon
but a memory in the little house at Ajaccio Parting is such sweet
sorrow murmured Joseph as he watched the little vessel bounding
over the turquoise waters of the imprisoned sea I shall miss him
but there are those who wax fat on grief and if I know myself I am
of that brand

Arrived at Paris Napoleon was naturally awestricken by the
splendors of that wonderful city

I shall never forget the first sight I had of Paris he said years
later when speaking of his boyhood to Madame Junot with whom he was
enjoying a teteatete in the palace at Versailles I wondered if I
hadnt died of seasickness on the way over as I had several times
wished I might and got to heaven I didnt know how like the other
place it was at that time you see It was like an enchanted land a
Worlds Fair forever and the prices I had to pay for things quite
carried out the Worlds Fair idea They were enormous Weary with
walking for instance I hired a fiacre and drove about the city for
an hour and it cost me fifty francs but I fell in with pleasant
enough people one of whom gave me a tenfranc ticket entitling me to
a seat on a park benchfor five francs

Madame Junot laughed

And yet they claim that bunco is a purely American institution she
said

Dame cried Napoleon rising from the throne and walking excitedly
up and down the palace floor I never realized until this moment
that I had been swindled Bourrienne send Fouche to me I remember
the man distinctly and if he lives he has yet to die

Calming down he walked to Madame Junots side and taking her by
the hand continued

And then the theatres What revelations of delight they were I
used to go to the Theatre Francais whenever I could sneak away and
had the money to seat me with the gods in the galleries Bernhardt
was then playing juvenile parts and Coquelin had not been heard of
Ah my dear Madame Junot he added giving her ear a delicate pinch
those were the days when life seemed worth the livingwhen one of a
taciturn nature and prone to irritability could find real pleasure in
existence Oh to be unknown again

And then Madame Junots husband having entered the room the Emperor
once more relapsed into a moody silence

But to return to Brienne Napoleon soon found that there is a gulf
measurable by no calculable distance between existence as the
dominating force of a family and life as a new boy at a boarding
school He found his position reversed and he began for the first
time in his life to appreciate the virtues of his brother Joseph He
who had been the victorious general crossing the Alps now found
himself the Alp with a dozen victorious generals crossing him he
who had been the gunner was now the target and his present inability
to express his feelings in language which his tormentors could
understand for he had not yet mastered the French tongue kept him
in a state of being which may well be termed volcanic

I simply raged within in those days Napoleon once said to Las
Casas I could have swallowed my food raw and it would have been
cooked on its way down I boiled so They took me for a snowclad
Alp when as a matter of fact I was a small Vesuvius with a
temperature that would have made Tabasco sauce seem like iced water
by contrast

His treatment at the hands of his fellowstudents did much to
increase his irritability but he kept himself well in hand biding
the time when he could repay their insults with interest They
jeered him because he was shortshort of stature and short of funds
they twitted him on being an alien calling him an Italian and
asking him why he did not seek out a position in the streetcleaning
bureau instead of endeavoring to associate with gentlemen To this
the boy made a spirited reply

I am fitting myself for that he said Ill sweep your Parisian
streets some day and some of you particles will go with the rest of
the dust before my broom

He little guessed how prophetic were these words

Again they tormented Napoleon on being the son of a lawyer and
asked him who his tailor was and whether or not his garments were
the lost suits of his fathers clients the result of which was that
though born of an aristocratic family the boy became a pronounced
Republican and swore eternal enmity to the highborn Another
result of this attitude towards him was that he retired from the
companionship of all save his books and he became intimate with
Homer and Ossian and Plutarchfamiliar with the rise and fall of
emperors and empires Challenged to fight a duel with one of his
classmates for a supposititious insult he accepted and having the
choice in weapons chose an examination in mathematics the one first
failing in a demonstration to blow his brains out That is the
safer for you he said to his adversary You are sure to lose but
the aftereffects will not be fatal because you have no brains to
blow out so you can blow out a candle instead

Whatever came of the duel we are not informed but it is to be
presumed that it did not result fatally for young Bonaparte for he
lived many years after the incident as most of our readers are
probably aware Had he not done so this biography would have had to
stop here and countless readers of our own day would have been
deprived of much entertaining fiction that is even now being
scattered broadcast over the world with Napoleon as its hero His
love of books combined with his fondness for military life was never
more beautifully expressed than when he wrote to his mother With
my sword at my side and my Homer in my pocket I hope to carve my way
through the world

The beauty and simplicity of this statement is not at all affected by
Josephs flippant suggestion that by this Napoleon probably meant
that he would read his enemies to sleep with his Homer and then use
his sword to cut their heads off Joseph as we have already seen
had been completely subjugated by his younger brother and it is not
to be wondered at perhaps that with his younger brother at a safe
distance he should manifest some jealousy and affect to treat his
sentiments with an unwarranted levity

For Napoleons selfimposed solitude everything at Brienne arranged
itself propitiously Each of the students was provided with a small
patch of ground which he could do with as he pleased and Napoleons
use of his allotted share was characteristic He converted it into a
fortified garden surrounded by trees and palisades

Now I can mope in peace he saidand he did

It has been supposed by historians that it was here that Napoleon did
all of his thinking mapping out his future career and some of them
have told us what he thought He dreamed of future glory always one
of them states but whether upon the authority of a palisade or a
tigerlily is not mentioned Others have given us his soliloquies as
he passed to and fro in this little retreat alone and heard only by
the stars at night but for ourselves we must be accurate and it is
due to the reader at this point that we should confesshaving no
stars in our confidenceour entire ignorance as to what Napoleon
Bonaparte said did or thought when sitting in solitude in his
fortified bower though if our candid impression is desired we have
no hesitation in saying that we believe him to have been in Paris
enjoying the sights of the great city during those periods of
solitude Boys are boys in all lands and a knowledge of that
peculiar species of human beings the boardingschool boy is
convincing that given a prospect of five or six hours of
uninterrupted solitude no youth of proper spirit would fail to avail
himself of the opportunities thus offered to see life particularly
with a city like Paris within easy hooky distance

It must also be remembered that the French had at this time abolished
the hereafter along with the idea of a Deity and all pertaining
thereto so that there was nothing beyond a purely temporal
discipline and lack of funds to interfere with Bonapartes enjoyment
of all the pleasures which Paris could give Of temporal discipline
he need have had no fear since it was perforce relaxed while he was
master of his solitude as for the lack of funds history has shown
that this never interfered with the fulfilment of Napoleons hopes
and hence the belief that the beautiful pictures drawn by historians
and painted by masters of the brush of Napoleon in solitude should
be revised to include a few accessories drawn from such portions of
Parisian life as will readily suggest themselves

In his studies however Napoleon ranked high His mathematical
abilities were so marked that it was stated that he could square the
circle with his eyes closed and both hands tied behind his back

The only circle I could not square at that time said he was the
family circle being insufficiently provided with income to do so I
might have succeeded better had not Josephs appetite grown too fast
for the strength of my pocket that was the only respect however in
which I ever had any difficulty in keeping up with my dear elder
brother It was here too that he learned the inestimably
important military fact that the shortest distance between two points
is in a straight line and that he had fully mastered that fact was
often painfully evident to such of his schoolmates as seemed to force
him to measure with his right arm the distance between his shoulder
and the ends of their noses Nor was he utterly without wit Asked
by a cribbing comrade in examination what a corollary was Napoleon
scornfully whispered back

A mathematical camel with two humps

In German only was he deficient much to the irritation of his
instructor

Will you ever learn anything asked M Bouer the German teacher

Certainly said Napoleon but no more German I know the only
word I need in that language

And what pray is that

Surrender thats all Ill ever wish to say to the Germans But
lest I get it wrong pray tell me the imperative form of surrender in
your native tongue

M Bouers reply is not known to history but it was probably not one
which the Master of Etiquette at Brienne could have entirely
commended

So he lived at Brienne thoroughly mastering the science of war
acquiring a military spirit making no friends but commanding
ultimately the fearsome respect of his schoolmates One or two
private interviews with little aristocrats who jeered at him for his
ancestry convinced them that while he might not have had illustrious
ancestors it was not unlikely that he would in time develop
illustrious descendants and the jeerings and sneerings soon ceased
The climax of Bonapartes career at Brienne was in 1784 when he
directed a snowball fight between two evenly divided branches of the
school with such effect that one boy had his skull cracked and the
rest were laid up for weeks from their wounds

It was a wonderful fight remarked Napoleon during his campaign in
Egypt I took good care that an occasional missent ball should bowl
off the hat of M Bouer and whenever any particularly aristocratic
aristocrats head showed itself above the ramparts an avalanche fell
upon his facade with a dull sickening thud I have never seen an
American college football game but from all I can learn from
accounts in the Paris editions of the American newspapers the effects
physical in our fight and that game are about the same

In 1784 shortly after this episode Napoleon left Brienne having
learned all that those in authority there could teach him and in
1785 he applied for and received admission to the regular army much
to the relief of Joseph

If he had flunked and come back to Corsica to live said Joseph I
think I should have emigrated I love him dearly but Im fonder of
myself and Corsica large as it is is too small to contain Napoleon
Bonaparte and his brother Joseph simultaneously particularly as
Joseph is distinctly weary of being used as an understudy for a gory
battlefield



CHAPTER III PARISVALENCELYONSCORSICA
17851793



The feeling among the larger boys at Brienne at Napoleons departure
was much the same as that experienced by Joseph when his soon tobe
famous brother departed from Corsica The smaller boys regretted his
departure since it had been one of their greatest pleasures to watch
Napoleon disciplining the upper classmen but Bonaparte was as glad
to go as the elders were to have him

Brienne is good enough in its way said he but whats the use of
fighting children Its merely a waste of time cracking a
youngsters skull with a snowball when you can go out into the real
world and let daylight into a mans whole system with a few ounces of
grapeshot

He had watched developments at Paris too with the keenest interest
and was sufficiently farseeing to know that the troubles of the King
and Queen and their aristocratic friends boded well for a man fond of
a military life who had sense enough to be on the right side That
it took an abnormal degree of intelligence to know which was the
right side in those troublous days he also realized and hence he
cultivated that taciturnity and proneness to irritability which we
have already mentioned

If it had not been for my taciturnity Talleyrand he observed
when in the height of his power I should have got it in the neck

Got what in the neck asked Talleyrand

The guillotine rejoined the Emperor It was the freedom of
speech which people of those sanguinary days allowed themselves that
landed many a fine head in the basket As for me I simply held my
tongue with both hands and when I wearied of that I called some one
in to hold it for me If I had filled the newspapers with
Interviews with Napoleon Bonaparte and articles on Where is
France at with monographs in the leading reviews every month on
Why I am what I am and all such stuff as that Id have condensed
my career into one or two years and ended by having my head divorced
from my shoulders in a most commonplace fashion Taciturnity is a
big thing when you know how to work it and so is proneness to
irritability The latter keeps you from making friends and I didnt
want any friends just then They were luxuries which I couldnt
afford You have to lend money to friends you have to give them
dinners and cigars and send bonbons to their sisters A friend in
those days would have meant bankruptcy of the worst sort
Furthermore friends embarrass you when you get into public office
and try to make you conspicuous when youd infinitely prefer to saw
wood and say nothing I took my loneliness straight and that is one
of the reasons why I am now the Emperor of France and your master

Before entering the army a year at a Parisian military school kept
Bonaparte busy There as at Brienne he made his influence felt
He found his fellowpupils at Paris living in a state of luxury that
was not in accord with his ideas as to what a soldier should have
Whether or not his new schoolmates after the timehonored custom
tossed him in a blanket on the first night of his arrival history
does not say but Bonaparte had hardly been at the school a week when
he complained to the authorities that there was too much luxury in
their system for him

Cadets do not need featherbeds and eiderdown quilts he said
and as for the sumptuous viands we have served at mealtime they are
utterly inappropriate Id rather have a plate of Boston baked beans
or steaming buckwheat cakes to put my mind into that state which
should characterize the thinking apparatus of a soldier than a dozen
of the bouchees financieres and lobster Newburgs and other made
dishes which you have on your menu Madedishes and delicate
beverages make one mellow and genial of disposition What we need is
the kind of food that will destroy our amiability and put us in a
frame of mind calculated to make willing to kill our best friends
nay our own brothers and sistersif occasion arises with a smiling
face Look at me I could kill my brother Joseph dear as he is to
me and never shed a tear and its buckwheatcakes and waffles that
have done it

Likewise he abhorred dancing

Away with dancing men he cried impatiently at one time when in
the height of his power to his Minister of War Suppose when I was
crossing the Alps my soldiers had been of your dancing sort How far
would I have got if every time the band played a twostep my
grenadiers had dropped their guns to pirouette over those snowwhite
wastes Let the diplomats do the dancing For soldiers give me men
to whom the polka is a closed book and the waltz an abomination

Holding these views he naturally failed to win the sympathy of his
fellows at the Paris school who young nobles for the most part
could not understand his point of view So having nothing else to
do he applied himself solely to his studies and to reflection and
it was the happiest moment of his life up to that time when having
passed his examinations for entrance to the regular army he received
his commission as a second lieutenant

Now were off he said to himself as he surveyed himself in the
mirror after donning his uniform

It does not set very well in the back remarked one of the maids of
the pension in which he lived glancing in at the door

It does not matter returned Bonaparte loftily As long as it
sets well in front Im satisfied for you should know madame that a
true soldier never shows his back and that is the kind of a military
person I am A false front would do for me I am no tin soldier
which in afteryears it will interest you to remember When you are
writing your memoirs this will make an interesting anecdote

From this it is to be inferred that at this time he had no thought of
Moscow Immediately after his appointment Bonaparte repaired to
Valence where his regiment was stationed and where he formed a
strong attachment for the young daughter of Madame du Colombier with
whom history records he ate cherries before breakfast This was
his sole dissipation at that time but his felicity was soon to be
interrupted His regiment was ordered to Lyons and Bonaparte and
his love were parted

Duty calls me my dear he said on leaving her I would stay if
I could but I cant and on the whole it is just as well If I
stayed I should marry you and that would never do You cannot
support me nor I you We cannot live on cherries and as yet my
allowance is an ingrowing onewhich is to say that it goes from me
to my parent and not from my parent to me Therefore my only love
farewell Marry some one else There are plenty of men who are fond
of cherries before breakfast and there is no reason why one so
attractive as you should not find a lover

The unhappy girl was silent for a moment Then with an ill
suppressed sob she bade him go

You are right Napoleon she said Go Go where duty calls you
and if you get tired of Lyons

Yes he interrupted eagerly

Try leopards she cried rushing from his embrace into the house

Bonaparte never forgave this exhibition of flippancy though many
years after when he learned that his former love who had married
as he had bade her do and suffered was face to face with
starvation it is said on the authority of one of his exvalets
memoirs that he sent her a box of candied cherries from one of the
most expensive confectioneryshops of Paris

After a brief sojourn at Lyons Napoleon was summoned with his
regiment to quell certain popular tumults at Auxonne There he
distinguished himself as a handler of mobs and learned a few things
that were of inestimable advantage to him later Speaking of it in
afteryears he observed It is my opinion my dear Emperor Joseph
that grapeshot is the only proper medicine for a mob Some people
prefer to turn the hose on them but none of that for me They fear
water as they do death but they get over water Death is more
permanent Ive seen many a rioter made respectable by a good
soaking return to the fray after he had dried out but in all my
experience I have never known a man who was once punctured by a
discharge of grapeshot who took any further interest in rioting

About this time he began to regulate his taciturnity On occasions
he had opinions which he expressed most forcibly In 1790 having
gone to an evening reception at Madame Neckars he electrified his
hostess and her guests by making a speech of some five hundred words
in length too long to be quoted here in full but so full of import
and delivered with such an air of authority that La Fayette who was
present paled visibly and Mirabeau drawing Madame de Stael to one
side whispered trembling with emotion Who is that young person

Whether this newly acquired tendency to break in upon the reserve
which had hitherto been the salient feature of his speech had
anything to do with it or not we are not aware but shortly
afterwards Napoleon deemed it wise to leave his regiment for a while
and to return to his Corsican home on furlough Of course an
affecting scene was enacted by himself and his family when they were
at last reunited Letitia his fond mother wept tears of joy and
Joseph shaking him by the hand rushed overcome with emotion from
the house Napoleon shortly after found him weeping in the garden

Why so sad Joseph he inquired Are you sorry I have returned

No dear Napoleon said Joseph turning away his head to hide his
tears it is not that I was only weeping becausebecause in the
nature of things you will have to go away again andthethe idea
of parting from you has for the moment upset my equilibrium

Then we must proceed to restore it said Napoleon and taking
Joseph by the right arm he twisted it until Joseph said that he felt
quite recovered

Napoleons stay at Corsica was quite uneventful Fearing lest by
giving way to love of family and sitting and talking with them in
the luxuriously appointed parlor belowstairs he should imbibe too
strong a love for comfort and ease and thus weaken his soldierly
instincts as well as break in upon that taciturnity which as we
have seen was the keynote of his character he had set apart for
himself a small room on the attic floor where he spent most of his
time undisturbed and at the same time made Joseph somewhat easier in
his mind

When hes upstairs I am comparatively safe said Joseph If he
stayed below with us I fear I should have a return of my nervous
prostration

Meantime Napoleon was promoted to a first lieutenancy and shortly
after during the Reign of Terror in Paris having once more for the
moment yielded to an impulse to speak out in meeting he denounced
anarchy in unmeasured terms and was arrested and taken to Paris

It was a fortunate arrest for me he said There I was in Corsica
with barely enough money to pay my way back to the capital
Arrested the State had to pay my fare and I got back to active
political scenes on a free pass As for the trial it was a farce
and I was triumphantly acquitted The jury was out only fifteen
minutes I had so little to say for myself that the judges began to
doubt if I had any ideas on any subjector as one of them said
having no head to mention it would be useless to try and cut it off
Hence my acquittal and my feeling that taciturnity is the mother of
safety

Then came the terrible attack of the mob upon the Tuileries on the
20th of June 1792 Napoleon was walking in the street with
Bourrienne when the attack began

Theres nothing like a lamppost for an occasion like this it
broadens ones views so he said rapidly climbing up a convenient
post from which he could see all that went on I didnt know that
this was the royal familys receptionday Do you want to know what
I think

Mumm is the word whispered Bourrienne This is no time to have
opinions

Mumm may be the word but water is the beverage Mumm is too dry
What this crowd needs is a good wetting down retorted Bonaparte
If I were Louis XVI Id turn the hose on these tramps and keep
them at bay until I could get my little brass cannon loaded When I
had that loaded Id let them have a few balls hot from the bat
This is what comes of being a born king Louis doesnt know how to
talk to the people Hes all right for a statedinner but when it
comes to a massmeeting he is not in it

And then as the King to gratify the mob put the red cap of
Jacobinism upon his head the man who was destined before many years
to occupy the throne of France let fall an ejaculation of wrath

The wretches he cried How little they know Theyve only given
him another hat to talk through Theyll have to do their work all
over again unless Louis takes my advice and travels abroad for his
health

These words were prophetic for barely two months later the second
and most terrible and portentous attack upon the palace took place
an attack which Napoleon witnessed as he had witnessed the first
from a convenient lamppost and which filled him with disgust and
shame and it was upon that night of riot and bloodshed that he gave
utterance to one of his most famous sayings

Bourrienne said he as with his faithful companions he laboriously
climbed the five flights of stairs leading to his humble apartment
I hate the aristocrats as you know and today has made me hate the
populace as well What is there left to like

Alas lieutenant I cannot say said Bourrienne shaking his head
sadly

What continued Napoleon is the good of anything

I give it up returned Bourrienne with a sigh I never was good
at riddles What IS the good of anything

Nothing said Napoleon laconically as he took off his uniform and
went to bed



CHAPTER IV SARDINIATOULONNICEPARISBARRASJOSEPHINE
17931796



Greatness now began to dawn for Napoleon Practically penniless in
a great and heartless city even the lower classes began to perceive
that here was one before whom there lay a brilliant future
Restaurateurs laundresses confectionersall trusted him An
instance of the regard people were beginning to have for him is shown
in the pathetic interview between Napoleon and Madame Sans Gene his
laundress

Here is your wash lieutenant said she after climbing five
flights of stairs basket in hand to the miserable lodging of the
future Emperor

Napoleon looked up from his books and counted the clothes

There is one sock missing said he sternly

No returned Sans Gene Half of each sock was washed away and I
sewed the remaining halves into one One good sock is better than
two bad ones If you ever lose a leg in battle you may find the odd
one handy

How can I ever repay you cried Napoleon touched by her friendly
act

Im sure I dont know returned Madame Sans Gene demurely unless
you will escort me to the Charity BallIll buy the tickets

And pray what good will that do asked Bonaparte

It will make Lefebvre jealous said Madame Sans Gene and maybe
that will bring him to the point I want to marry him but
encourage him as I will he does not propose and as in revising the
calendar the government has abolished leapyear I really dont know
what to do

I cannot go to the ball said Napoleon sadly I dont dance
and besides I have loaned my dresssuit to Bourrienne But I will
flirt with you on the street if you wish and perhaps that will
suffice

It is hardly necessary to tell the reader that the ruse was
successful and that Lefebvre thus brought to the point married
Madame Sans Gene and subsequently through his own advancement made
her the Duchess of Dantzig The anecdote suffices to show how
wretchedly poor and yet how full of interest and useful to those
about him Napoleon was at the time

In February 1793 a change for the better in his fortunes occurred
Bonaparte in cooperation with Admiral Turget was ordered to make a
descent upon Sardinia What immediately followed can best be told in
Bonapartes own words My descent was all right he said
afterwards and I had the Sardines all ready to put in boxes when
Turget had a fit of seasickness lost his bearings and left me in
the lurch There was nothing left for me but to go back to Corsica
and take it out of Joseph which I did much to Josephs unhappiness
It was well for the family that I did so for hardly had I arrived at
Ajaccio when I found my old friend Paoli wrapping Corsica up in a
brownpaper bundle to send to the King of England with his
compliments This I resisted with the result that our whole family
was banished and those fools of Corsicans broke into our house and
smashed all of our furniture They little knew that that furniture
if in existence today would bring millions of francs as curios if
sold at auction It was thus that the family came to move to France
and that I became in fact what I had been by birtha Frenchman If
I had remained a Corsican Paolis treachery would have made me an
Englishman to which I should never have become reconciled although
had I been an Englishman I should have taken more real pleasure out
of the battle of Waterloo than I got

After this I was ordered to Toulon The French forces here were
commanded by General Cartaux who had learned the science of war
painting portraits in Paris He ought to have been called General
Cartoon He besieged Toulon in a most impressionistic fashion Hed
bombard and bombard and bombard and then leave the public to guess
at the result Its all well enough to be an impressionist in
painting but when it comes to war the public want more decided
effects When I got there as a brigadiergeneral I saw that
Cartaux was wasting his time and ammunition His idea seemed to be
that by firing cannon all day he could so deafen the enemy that at
night the French army could sneak into Toulon unheard and capture the
city which was to say the least unscientific I saw at once that
Cartaux must go and I soon managed to make life so unbearable for
him that he resigned and a man named Doppet a physician was placed
in command Doppet was worse than Cartaux Whenever anybody got
hurt hed stop the war and prescribe for the injured man If he
could have prescribed for the enemy theyd have died in greater
numbers I have no doubt but like the idiot he was he practised on
his own forces Besides he was more interested in surgery than in
capturing Toulon He always gave the ambulance corps the right of
line and I believe to this day that his plan of routing the English
involved a sudden rush upon them taking them by surprise and the
subsequent amputation of their legs The worst feature of the
situation as I found it was that these two men falling back upon
their rights as my superior officers refused to take orders from me
I called their attention to the fact that rank had been abolished
and that in France one man was now as good as another but they were
stubborn so I wrote to Paris and had them removed Then came
Dugommier who backed me up in my plans and Toulon as a consequence
immediately fell with a dull sickening thud

It was during this siege that Bonaparte first encountered Junot
Having occasion to write a note while under fire from the enemys
batteries Napoleon called for a stenographer Junot came to him

Do you know shorthand asked the general as a bomb exploded at his
feet

Slightly said Junot calmly

Take this message returned the general coolly dictating

Junot took down Bonapartes words but just as he finished another
bomb exploded near by scattering dust and earth and sand all over
the paper

Confounded boors interrupting a gentleman at his correspondence
said Bonaparte with an angry glance at the hostile gunners Ill
have to dictate that message all over again

Yes general returned Junot quickly but you neednt mind that
There will be no extra charge Its really my fault I should have
brought an umbrella

You are a noble fellow said Napoleon grasping his hand and
squeezing it warmly In the heyday of my prosperity if my
prosperity ever goes ahaying I shall remember you Your name

Junot General was the reply

Bonaparte frowned Ha ha he laughed acridly You jest eh
Well Junot when I am Jupiter Ill reward you

Later on discovering his error Bonaparte made a memorandum
concerning Junot which was the first link in the chain which
ultimately bound the stenographer to fame as a marshal of France

There have been various other versions of this anecdote but this is
the only correct one and is now published for the first time on the
authority of M le Comte de B whose grandfather was the bass
drummer upon whose drum Junot was writing the now famous letter and
who was afterwards ennobled by Napoleon for his services in Egypt
where one dark drizzly night he frightened away from Bonapartes
tent a fierce band of hungry lions by pounding vigorously upon his
instrument

About this time Napoleon who had been spelling his name in various
ways and particularly with a u as Buonaparte decided to settle
finally upon one form of designation

People are beginning to bother the life out of me with requests for
my autograph he said to Bourrienne and it is just as well that I
should settle on one If I dont theyll want me to write out a
complete set of them and I havent time to do that

Buonaparte is a goodlooking name suggested Bourrienne It is
better than Bona Parte as you sometimes call yourself If you
settle on Bona Parte youd have really three names and as you dont
write society verse for the comic papers whats the use Newspaper
reporters will refer to you as Napoleon B Parte or N Bona Parte
and the public hates a man who parts his name in the middle Parte
is a good name in its way but its too short and abrupt Few men
with short sharp decisive names like that ever make their mark
Let it be Buonaparte which is sort of highsoundingit makes a
mouthful as it were

If I drop the u the autograph will be shorter and Ill gain time
writing it said Napoleon It shall be Bonaparte without u

Humph ejaculated Bourrienne Bonaparte without me I like that
Might as well talk of Dr Johnson without Boswell

Bonaparte now went to Nice as chief of batallion in the army of
Italy but having incurred the displeasure of a suspicious home
government he was shortly superseded and lived in retirement with
his family at Marseilles for a brief time Here he fell in love
again and would have married Mademoiselle Clery whom he afterwards
made Queen of Sweden had he not been so wretchedly poor

This my dear he said sadly to Mademoiselle Clery is the
beastly part of being the original ancestor of a family instead of a
descendant Ive got to make the fortune which will enrich
posterity while Id infinitely prefer having a rich uncle somewhere
whod have the kindness to die and leave me a million Theres
Josephlucky man Hes gone and got married He can afford it He
has me to fall back on but II havent anybody to fall back on and
so for the second time in my life must give up the only girl I ever
loved

With these words Napoleon left Mademoiselle Clery and returned to
Paris in search of employment

If theres nothing else to do I can disguise myself as a Chinaman
and get employment in Madame Sans Genes laundry he said Theres
no disgrace in washing and in that way I may be able to provide
myself with decent linen anyhow Then I shall belong to the
laundered aristocracy as the English have it

But greater things than this awaited Napoleon at Paris Falling in
with Barras a member of the Convention which ruled France at this
time he learned that the feeling for the restoration of the monarchy
was daily growing stronger and that the royalists of Paris were a
great menace to the Convention

Theyll mob us the first thing we know said Barras The members
look to me to save them in case of attack but I must confess Id
like to sublet the contract

Give it to me then Im temporarily out of a job said Napoleon
and the life Im leading is killing me If it werent for Talmas
kindness in letting me lead his armies on the stage at the Odeon
with a turn at sceneshifting when they are not playing war dramas I
dont know what Id do for my meals and even when I do get a
sandwich ahead occasionally I have to send it to Marseilles to my
mother Give me your contract and if I dont save your Convention
you neednt pay me a red franc I hate aristocrats and I hate mobs
and this being an aristocratic mob Ill go into the work with
enthusiasm

You cried Barras A man of your size or lack of it save the
Convention from a mob of fifty thousand Nonsense

Did you ever hear that little slang phrase so much in vogue in
America queried Napoleon coldly fixing his eye on Barrasa
phrase which in French runs Petit mais O Moior as they have
it Little but O My Well that is me 1 Besides if I am
small there is less chance of my being killed which will make me
more courageous in the face of fire than one of your bigger men would
be

I will put my mind on it said Barras somewhat won over by
Napoleons selfconfidence

Thanks said Napoleon and now come into the cafe and have dinner
with me

Save your money Bonaparte said Barras You cant afford to pay
for your own dinner much less mine

Thats precisely why I want you to dine with me returned Napoleon
If I go alone they wont serve me because they know I cant pay
If I go in with you theyll give me everything theyve got on the
supposition that you will pay the bill Come En avant

Vous etes un bouchonnier vraiment said Barras with a laugh

A what asked Napoleon not familiar with the idiom

A corker explained Barras

Very good said Napoleon his face lighting up If youll order a
bottle of Burgundy with the bird I will show you that I am likewise
something of an uncorker

This readiness on Napoleons part in the face of difficulty
completely captured Barras and as a result the young adventurer had
his first real chance to make an impression on Paris where on the
13th Vendemiaire or October 4 1795 he literally obliterated the
forces of the Sectionists whose success in their attack upon the
Convention would have meant the restoration of the Bourbons to the
throne of France Placed in command of the defenders of the
Convention Napoleon with his cannon swept the mob from the four
broad avenues leading to the palace in which the legislators sat

Dont fire over their heads said he to his gunners as the mob
approached Bring our arguments right down to their comprehension
and remember that the comprehension of a royalist is largely affected
by his digestion Therefore gunners let them have it there If
these assassins would escape appendicitis they would better avoid the
grape I send them

The result is too well known to need detailed description here
Suffice it to say that Bonapartes attentions to the digestive
apparatus of the rioters were so effective that in token of their
appreciation of his services the Convention soon afterwards placed
him in command of the Army of the Interior

Holding now the chief military position in Paris Bonaparte was much
courted by every one but he continued his simple manner of living as
of yore overlooking his laundry and other bills as unostentatiously
as when he had been a poor and insignificant subaltern and daily
waxing more taciturn and prone to irritability

You are becoming gloomy General said Barras one morning as the
two men breakfasted It is time for you to marry and become a
family man

Peste said Napoleon man of family It takes too longit is
tedious Families are delightful when the children are grown up but
I could not endure them in a state of infancy

Ah smiled Barras significantly But suppose I told you of a
place where you could find a family ready made

Napoleon at once became interested

I should marry it he said for truly I do need some one to look
after my clothing particularly now that as a man of high rank my
uniforms hold so many buttons

Thus it happened that Barras took the young hero to a reception at
the house of Madame Tallien where he introduced him to the lovely
widow Josephine de Beauharnais and her two beautiful children

There you are Bonaparte he whispered as they entered the room
there is the family completeone wife one son one daughter What
more could you want It will be yours if you ask for it for Madame
de Beauharnais is very much in love with you

Ha said Napoleon How do you know that

She told me so returned Barras

Very well said Napoleon making up his mind on the instant I
will see if I can involve her in a military engagement

Which as the world knows he did and on the 9th of March 1796
Napoleon and Josephine were united and the happy groom writing to
his mother announcing his marriage to the only woman he ever
loved said She is ten years older than I but I can soon
overcome that The opportunities for a fast life in Paris are
unequalled and I have an idea that I can catch up with her in six
months if the Convention will increase my salary



CHAPTER V ITALYMILANVIENNAVENICE
17961797



After a honeymoon of ten days Napoleon returned to work Assuming
command of the army of Italy he said I am at last in business for
myself Keep your eyes on me Bourrienne and youll wear blue
goggles Youll have to youll be so dazzled We will set off at
once for Italy The army is in wretched shape It lacks shoes
clothes food It lacks everything I dont think it even has
sense If it had it would strike for lower wages

Lower wages queried Bourrienne You mean higher dont you

Not I said Bonaparte They couldnt collect higher wages but if
their pay was reduced they might get it once in a while We can
change all this however by invading Italy Italy has all things to
burn from statuary to Leghorn hats In three months we shall be at
Milan There we can at least provide ourselves with fine collections
of oilpaintings Meantime let the army feed on hope and wrap
themselves in meditation Its poor stuff but theres plenty of it
and its cheap On holidays give the poor fellows extra rations and
if hope does not sustain them cheer them up with promises of drink
Tell them when we get to Italy they can drink in the scenery in
unstinted measure and meanwhile keep the band playing merrily
Theres nothing like music to drive away hunger I understand that
the lamented kings appetite was seriously affected by the
Marseillaise

To his soldiers he spoke with equal vigor

Soldiers he said sartorially speaking you are a poor lot but
France does not want a tailormade army at this juncture We are not
about to go on dress parade but into grimvisaged war and the
patches on your trousers if you present a bold front to the enemy
need never be seen You are also hungry but so am I I have had no
breakfast for four hours The Republic owes you much but money is
scarce and you must whistle for your pay The emigres have gone
abroad with all the circulating medium they could lay their hands on
and the Government has much difficulty in maintaining the gold
reserve For my part I prefer fighting for glory to whistling for
money Fighting is the better profession You are men Leave
whistling to boys Follow me into Italy where there are fertile
plainsplains from whose pregnant soil the olive springs at the rate
of a million bottles a year plains through whose lovely lengths
there flow rivers of Chianti Follow me to Italy where there are
opulent towns with clothingstores on every block and churches
galore with their poorboxes bursting with gold Soldiers can you
resist the alluring prospect

Vive lEmpereur cried the army with one voice

Napoleon frowned

Soldiers he cried Remember this you are making history
therefore pray be accurate I am not yet Emperor and you are
guilty of an anachronism of a most embarrassing sort Some men make
history in a warm room with pen and ink aided by guidebooks and
collections of anecdotes Leave anachronisms and inaccuracies to
them For ourselves we must carve it out with our swords and
cannon we must rubricate our pages with our gore and punctuate our
periods with our bayonets Let it not be said by future ages that we
held our responsibilities lightly and were careless of facts and to
that end dont refer to me as Emperor until you are more familiar
with dates When we have finished with Italy Ill take you to the
land where dates grow Meanwhile restez tranquille as they say in
French and breathe all the air you want France can afford you that
in unstinted measure

Vive Bonaparte cried the army taking the rebuke in good part

Now youre shouting said Napoleon with a smile Youre a good
army and if you stick by me youll wear diamonds

We have forgotten one thing said Barras a few days later on the
eve of Napoleons departure We havent any casus belli

Whats that said Napoleon who had been so busy with his
preparations that he had forgotten most of his Greek and Latin

Cause for war said Barras Where were you educated If you are
going to fight the Italians youve got to have some principle to
fight for

Thats precisely what we are going to fight for said Napoleon
Were a bankrupt people Were going to get some principal to set
us up in business We may be able to float some bonds in Venice

True returned Barras but that after all is mere highway
robbery

Well all Ive got to say retorted Napoleon with a sneerall
Ive got to say is that if your Directory cant find something in the
attitude of Italy towards the Republic to take offence at the sooner
it goes out of business the better Ill leave that question
entirely to you fellows at Paris I cant do everything You look
after the casus and Ill take care of the belli

This plan was adopted The Directory after discussing various
causes for action finally decided that an attack on Italy was
necessary for three reasons First because the alliance between the
kings of Sardinia and Austria was a menace to the Republic and must
therefore be broken Second the Austrians were too near the Rhine
for Frances comfort and must be diverted before they had drunk all
the wine of the country of which the French were very fond and
third His Holiness the Pope had taken little interest in the now
infidel France and must therefore be humiliated These were the
reasons for the war settled upon by the government and as they were
as satisfactory to Napoleon as any others he gave the order which
set the army of Italy in motion

How shall we go General asked Augereau one of his subordinates
Over the Alps

Not this time returned Napoleon It is too cold The army has
no eartabs Well skirt the Alps and maybe the skirt will make
them warmer

This the army proceeded at once to do and within a month the first
object of the war was accomplished

The Sardinian king was crushed and the army found itself in
possession of food drink and clothes to a surfeit Bonapartes
pride at his success was great but not overweening

Soldiers he cried you have done well So have I Hannibal
crossed the Alps We didnt but we got here just the same You
have provided yourselves with food and clothes and declared a
dividend for the Treasury of France which will enable the Directory
to buy itself a new hat through which to address the people You
have reason to be proud of yourselves Pat yourselves on your backs
with my compliments but remember one thing Our tickets are to
Milan and no stopovers are allowed Therefore do not as yet relax
your efforts Milan is an imperial city The guidebooks tell us
that its cathedral is a beauty the place is full of pictures and
the operahouse finished in 1779 is the largest in the world It can
be done in two days and the hotels are good Can you therefore
sleep here

No no cried the army

Then cried Napoleon tightening his reins and lifting his horse on
to its hindlegs and holding his sword aloft A Milan

How like a statue he looks said Lannes admiringly

Yes replied Augereau youd think he was solid brass

The Austrian troops were now concentrated behind the Po but Napoleon
soon outgeneralled their leaders drove them back to the Adda and
himself pushed on to the Bridge of Lodi which connected the east and
west branches of that river

When I set out for the P O P E said Napoleon Im not going
to stop halfway and turn back at the P O Weve got the Austrians
over the Adda and thats just where we want them I had a dream
once about the Bridge of Lodi and its coming true now or never
Well take a few of our long divisions cross the Adda and subtract
a few fractions of the remainder now left the Austrians This will
destroy their enthusiasm and Milan will be ours

The words were prophetic for on the 10th of May the French did
precisely what their commander had said they would do and on the
fourteenth day of May the victorious French entered Milan the
wealthy capital of Lombardy

Curious fact said Napoleon In times of peace if a man needs a
tonic you give him iron and it builds him up but in war if you give
the troops iron it bowls em down Look at those Austrians theyve
got nervous prostration of the worst sort

They got too much iron said Lannes

Too much tonic is worse than none A man can stand ten or twenty
grains of iron but forty pounds is rather upsetting

True acquiesced Napoleon Well it was a great fight and I have
only one regret I do wish youd had a Kodak to take a few snap
shots of me at that Bridge of Lodi Id like to send some home to
the family It would have reminded brother Joseph of old times to
see me dashing over that bridge prodding its planks with my heels
until it fairly creaked with pain It would have made a good
frontispiece for Bourriennes book too And now my dear Lannes
what shall we do with ourselves for the next five days Get out your
Baedecker and let us see this imperial city of the Lombards

Theres one matter we must arrange first said Augereau we
havent any stable accommodations to speak of

Whats the matter with the stalls at the operahouse suggested
Napoleon As I told the troops the other day its the biggest
theatre in the world You ought to be able to stable the horses
there and lodge the men in the boxes

The horses would look well sitting in orchestra chairs wouldnt
they said Augereau Its not feasible As for the boxes theyre
mostly held by subscribers

Then stable them in the picturegalleries said the general It
will be good discipline

The people will call that sacrilege returned Augereau

Not if we remove the pictures said Bonaparte Well send the
pictures to Paris

Accordingly this was done and the galleries of France were thereby
much enriched We mention these details at length because Napoleon
has been severely criticised for thus impoverishing Italy as well as
for his socalled contempt of arta criticism which in the face of
this accurate version must fall to the ground The pictures were
sent by him to Paris merely to preserve them and as he himself
said a propos of the famous Da Vinci beneath which horses and men
alike were quartered Id have sent that too but to do it Id have
had to send the whole chapel or scrape the picture off the wall
These Italians should rather thank than condemn me for leaving it
where it was Mine was not an army of destruction but a Salvation
Army of the highest type

You made mighty few converts for a Salvation Army said Talleyrand
to whom this remark was addressed

Thats where you are wrong said Napoleon I made angels of
innumerable Austrians and converted quite a deal of Italian into
French territory

It was hardly to be doubted that Napoleons successes would arouse
jealousies in Paris and the Directory fearing the hold the
victorious general was acquiring upon the people took steps to limit
his powers Bonaparte instantly resigned his command and threatened
to return to Paris which so frightened the government that they
refused to accept his resignation

From this time on for nearly a year Napoleons career was a
succession of victories He invaded the Papal States and acquired
millions of francs and hundreds of pictures He chastised all who
opposed his sway and after pursuing the Austrians as far as Leoben
within sight of Vienna he humbled the haughty Emperor Joseph

Ill recognize your Republic said the Emperor at last finding
that there was nothing else to be done

Thanks said NapoleonI thought you would but I dont know
whether the Republic will recognize you She doesnt even know you
by sight

Is that all you want asked the Emperor anxiously

For the present yes Some day I may come back for something else
returned Napoleon significantly And bytheway when you are
sending your card to the French people just enclose a small
remittance of a few million francs not necessarily for publication
but as a guarantee of good faith Dont send all youve got but
just enough You may want to marry off one of your daughters some
day and it will be well to save something for her dowry

It was in little acts of this nature that Napoleon showed his
wonderful foresight One would almost incline to believe from this
particular incident that Bonaparte foresaw the MarieLouise episode
in his future career

The Austrians humbled Napoleon turned his attention to Venice
Venice had been behaving in a most exasperating fashion and the
conqueror felt that the time had come to take the proud City of the
Sea in hand

If the Venetians have any brains said he to Bourrienne who joined
him about this time secretly representing it is said a newspaper
syndicate service theyll put on all the sail theyve got and take
their old city out to sea Theyre in for the worst ducking they
ever got

Im afraid youll find them hard to get at said Bourrienne That
lagoon is a wet place

Oh as for that said Bonaparte a little water will do the army
good Weve been fighting so hard its been months since theyve had
a good tubbing and a swim wont hurt them Send Lannes here In a
few minutes Lannes entered Bonapartes tent

Lannes were off for Venice Provide the army with overshoes and
have our luggage checked through said Bonaparte

Yes General

Can Augereau swim

I dont know General

Well find out and if he cant well get him a balloon

Thus taking every precaution for the comfort of his men and the
safety of his officers Napoleon set out Venice hearing of his
approach was filled with consternation and endeavored to temporize
The Doges offered millions if Bonaparte would turn his attention to
others to which Napoleon made this spirited reply Venetians tell
the Doges with my compliments that I am coming The wealth of the
Indies couldnt change my mind They offer me stocks and bonds
well I believe their stocks and bonds to be as badly watered as
their haughty city and Ill have none of them Ill bring my stocks
with me and your Doges will sit in them Ill bring my bonds and
your nobles shall put them on and make them clank Youve been
drowning Frenchmen every chance youve had It will now be my
pleasing duty to make you do a little gurgling on your own account
Youll find out for the first time in your lives what it is to be in
the swim Put on your bathingsuits and prepare for the avenger
The lions of St Marc must lick the dust

We have no dust General said one of the messengers

Then youd better get some retorted Napoleon for you will have
to come down with it to the tune of millions

True to his promise Napoleon appeared at the lagoon on the 31st of
May and the hitherto haughty Venice fell with a splash that could be
heard for miles first having sent five ships of war 3000000
francs as many more in naval stores twenty of her best pictures
the bronze horses of the famous church five hundred manuscripts and
one apology to the French Republic as the terms of peace The bronze
horses were subsequently returned but what became of the manuscripts
we do not know They probably would have been returned alsoa large
portion of them at leastif postagestamps had been enclosed This
is mere theory of course but it is rendered reasonable by the fact
that this is the usual fate of most manuscripts nor is there any
record of their having been published in the Moniteur the only
periodical which the French government was printing at that time

As for Bonaparte it was as balm to his soul to humble the haughty
Doges whose attitude towards him had always been characterized by a
superciliousness which filled him with resentment

It did me good he said many years after with a laugh to see
those Doges swimming up and down the Grand Canal in their state
robes trying to look dignified while I stood on the sidewalk and
asked them why they didnt come in out of the wet



CHAPTER VI MONTEBELLOPARISEGYPT
17971799



Josephine now deemed it well to join her lord at Milan There had
been so many only women he had ever loved that she was not satisfied
to remain at Paris while he was conducting gardenparties at the
Castle of Montebello Furthermore Bonaparte himself wished her to
be present

This Montebello life is after all little else than a dress
rehearsal for what is to come he said confidentially to
Bourrienne and Josephine cant afford to be absent Its a great
business this being a Dictator and having a court of your own and
Im inclined to think I shall follow it up as my regular profession
after Ive conquered a little more of the earth

Surrounded by every luxury and in receipt for the first time in his
life of a steady income Bonaparte carried things with a high hand
He made treaties with various powers without consulting the
Directory for whom every day he felt a growing contempt

What is the use of my consulting the Directory anyhow he asked
If it were an Elite Directory it might be worth while but it isnt
I shall therefore do as I please and if they dont like what I do
Ill ratify it myself

Ambassadors waited upon him as though he were a king and when one
ventured to disagree with the future Emperor he wished he hadnt
Cobentzel the envoy of the Austrian ruler soon discovered this

I refuse to accept your ultimatum said he one day to Napoleon
after a protracted conference

You do ehsaid Napoleon picking up a vase of delicate
workmanship Do you see this jug

Yes said Cobentzel

Well continued Napoleon dropping it to the floor where it was
shattered into a thousand pieces do you see it now

I do said Cobentzel what then

It has a mate said Napoleon significantly and if you do not
accept my ultimatum Ill smash the other one upon your plain but
honest countenance

Cobentzel accepted the ultimatum

Bonapartes contempt for the Directory was beginning to be shared by
a great many of the French and to save themselves the Five Sires
of the Luxembourg as the Directory were called resolved on a
brilliant stroke which involved no less a venture than the invasion
of England Bonaparte hearing of this and anxious to see London
of which he had heard much left Italy and returned to Paris

If theres a free tour of England to be had Josephine said he I
am the man to have it Besides this climate of Italy is getting
pretty hot for an honest man Ive refused twenty million francs in
bribes in two weeks If theyd offered another sou Im afraid Id
have taken it I will therefore go to Paris secure the command of
the army of England and pay a few of my respects to George Third
Esq I hear a great many English drop their hs Ill see if I cant
make em drop their l s ds as well

Arrived in Paris Bonaparte was much courted by everybody

I have arrived he said with a grim smile Even my creditors are
glad to see me and Ill show them that I have not forgotten them by
running up a few more bills

This he did going to the same tradesmen that he had patronized in
his days of poverty To his hatter whom he owed for his last five
hats he said

They call me haughty here they say I am cold Well I am cold
Ive shivered on the Alps several times since I was here last and it
has chilled my nature It has given me the grip so to speak and
when I lose my grip the weather will be even colder Give me a hat
my friend

What size asked the hatter

The same said Bonaparte with a frown Why do you ask

I was told your head had swelled returned the hatter meekly

They shall pay for this murmured Napoleon angrily

I am glad said the hatter with a sigh I was wondering whod
pay for it

Oh you were eh said Napoleon Well wonder no more Get out
your books

The hatter did so

Now charge it said Napoleon

To whom asked the hatter

Those eminent financiers Profit  Loss said Napoleon with a
laugh as he left the shop Thats what I call a most successful
hattalk he added as he told Bourrienne of the incident later in
the day

How jealous they all are said Bourrienne The idea of your
having a swelled head is ridiculous

Of course said Napoleon all Ive got is a proper realization of
Whom I Am as they say in Boston But wait my boy wait When I
put a crown on my head

What Bonaparte would have said will never be known for at that
moment the generals servant announced Mme Sans Gene his former
laundress and that celebrated woman unconventional as ever stalked
into the room Napoleon looked at her coldly

You are he queried

Your former laundress she replied

Ah and you want

My pay she retorted

I am sorry madame said the General but the expenses of my
Italian tour have been very great and I am penniless I will
however assist you to the full extent of my power Here are three
collars and a dressshirt If you will launder them I will wear them
to the state ball tomorrow evening and will tell all my rich and
influential friends who did them up and if you wish I will send you
a letter saying that I patronized your laundry once two years ago
and have since used no other

These anecdotes unimportant in themselves are valuable in that they
refute the charges made against General Bonaparte at this time
first that he returned from Egypt with a fortune and second that
he carried himself with a hauteur which rendered him unapproachable

For various reasons the projected invasion of England was abandoned
and the expedition to Egypt was substituted This pleased Napoleon
equally as well

I wasnt stuck on the English invasion anyhow he said in writing
to Joseph In the first place they wanted me to go in October
when the London season doesnt commence until spring and in the
second place I hate fogs and muttonchops Egypt is more to my
taste England would enervate me Egypt with the Desert of Sahara
in its backyard will give me plenty of sand and if you knew what
projects I have in mindwhich of course you dont for you never
knew anything my dear Josephyoud see how much of that I need

The Directory were quite as glad to have Napoleon go to Egypt as he
was to be sent Their jealousy of him was becoming more painful to
witness every day

If he goes to England said Barras hell conquer it sure as
fate and it will be near enough for excursion steamers to take the
French people over to see him do it If that happens we are lost

Hell conquer Egypt though and hell tell about it in such a way
that he will appear twice as great suggested Carnot Seems to me
wed better sell out at once and be done with it

Not so said Moulin Let him go to Egypt Very likely hell fall
off a pyramid there and break his neck

Or get sunstruck suggested Barras

Theres no question about it in my mind said Gohier Egypt is
the place If he escapes the pyramids or sunstroke there are still
the lions and the simoon not to mention the rapid tides of the Red
Sea Why he just simply cant get back alive I vote for Egypt

Thus it happened that on the 19th day of May 1798 with an army of
forty thousand men and a magnificant staff of picked officers
Napoleon embarked for Egypt

Im glad were off said he to the sailor who had charge of his
steamerchair Ive got to hurry up and gain some more victories or
these French will forget me A man has to make a threeringed circus
of himself to keep his name before the public these days

What are you fightin for this time sir asked the sailor who had
not heard that war had been declaredile paintins or pyramids

I am going to free the people of the East from the oppressor said
Napoleon loftily

And its a noble work your honor said the sailor Who is it
thats oppressin these people down East

Youll have to consult the Directory said Napoleon coldly
Leave me I have other things to think of

On the 10th of June Malta was reached and the Knights of St John
long disused to labor of any sort like many other knights of more
modern sort surrendered in most hospitable fashion inviting
Napoleon to come ashore and accept the freedom of the island or
anything else he might happen to want His reply was characteristic

Tell the Knights of Malta to attend to their cats Im after
continents not islands said he and with this leaving a
detachment of troops to guard his new acquisition he proceeded to
Alexandria which he reached on the 1st of July Here in the midst
of a terrible storm and surf Napoleon landed his forces and
immediately made a proclamation to the people

Fellahs he cried I have come The newspapers say to destroy
your religion As usual they prevaricate I have come to free you
All you who have yokes to shed prepare to shed them now I come with
the olivebranch in my hand Greet me with outstretched palms Do
not fight me for I am come to save you and I shall utterly
obliterate any man be he fellah Moujik or even the great Marmalade
himself who prefers fighting to being saved We may not look it
but we are true Mussulmen If you doubt it feel our muscle We
have it to burn Desert the Mamelukes and be saved The Pappylukes
are here

On reading this proclamation Alexandria immediately fell and
Bonaparte using the Koran as a guidebook proceeded on his way up
the Nile The army suffered greatly from the glare and burning of
the sunscorched sand and from the myriads of pestiferous insects
that infested the country but Napoleon cheered them on Soldiers
he cried when they complained if this were a summer resort and
you were paying five dollars a day for a room at a bad hotel youd
think yourselves in luck and youd recommend your friends to come
here for a rest Why not imagine this to be the case now Brace up
Well soon reach the pyramids and its a mighty poor pyramid that
hasnt a shady side On to Cairo

Its easy enough for you to talk murmured one Youve got a
camel to ride on and we have to walk

Well Heaven knows retorted Napoleon pointing to his camel
camel riding isnt like falling off a log At first I was carried
away with it but for the last two days it has made me so seasick I
can hardly see that hump

After this there was no more murmuring but Bonaparte did not for an
instant relax his goodhumor

The water is vile said Dessaix one morning

Why not drink milk then asked the commander

Milk Id love to returned Dessaix but where shall I find
milk

At the dairy said Napoleon with a twinkle in his eye

What dairy asked Dessaix not observing the twinkle

The dromedary said Napoleon with a roar

Little incidents like this served to keep the army in good spirits
until the 21st of July when they came in sight of the pyramids
Instantly Napoleon called a halt and the army rested The next day
drawing them up in line the General addressed them Soldiers he
cried pointing to the pyramids from the summits of those pyramids
forty centuries look down upon you You cant see them but they are
there No one should look down upon the French not even a century
Therefore I ask you shall we allow the forces of the Bey his
fellahs and his Tommylukes to drive us into the desert of Sahara
bag and baggage to subsist on a sealess seashore for the balance of
our days particularly when they havent any wheels on their cannon

No no cried the army

Then up sail and away cried Bonaparte This is to be no naval
affair but the army of the Bey awaits us

Tell the band to play a Wagner march he whispered hastily to his
aidedecamp Itll make the army mad and what we need now is
wrath

So began the battle of the Pyramids The result is too well known to
readers of contemporary history to need detailed statement here All
day long it raged and when night fell Cairo came with it Napoleon
worn out with fatigue threw himself down on a pyramid to rest

Ah he said as he breathed a sigh of relief what a glorious day
Weve beat em Wont the Directory be glad M Barras will be more
M Barrassed than ever Then turning and tapping on the door of
the massive pile he whispered softly Ah Ptolemy my man its
a pity youve no windows in this tomb Youd have seen a pretty
sight this day Kleber he added turning to that general do you
know why Ptolemy inside this pyramid and I outside of it are alike

I cannot guess General said Kleber Why

Were both in it returned Napoleon retiring to his tent

Later on in the evening summoning Bourrienne the victor said to
him

Mr Secretary I have a new autograph If Ptolemy can spell his
name with a p why shouldnt I Im not going to have history say
that a dead mummy could do things I couldnt Pnapoleon would look
well on a state paper

No doubt said Bourrienne but every one now says that you copy
Caesar Why give them the chance to call you an imitator of Ptolemy
also

True my friend true returned Napoleon in a tone of
disappointment I had not thought of that When you write my
autographs for the children of these Jennylukes

Mamelukes General corrected Bourrienne

Ah yesI always get mixed in these mattersfor the children of
these Mamelukes you may stick to the old form Goodnight

And with that the conqueror went to sleep as peacefully as a little
child

Had Bonaparte now returned to France he would have saved himself much
misery King of fire though he had become in the eyes of the
vanquished his bed was far from being one of roses

In a climate like that he observed sadly many years after Id
rather have been an ice baron Africa got entirely too hot to cut
any ice with me Ten days after I had made my friend Ptolemy turn
over in his grave Admiral Nelson came along with an English fleet
and challenged our Admiral Brueys to a shootingmatch for the
championship of Aboukir Bay Brueys having heard of what magazine
writers call the ships of the desert in my control supposing them to
be frigates and not camels imagined himself living in Easy Street
and accepted the challenge He expected me to sail around to the
other side of Nelson and so have him between two fires Well I
dont go to sea on camels as you know and the result was that after
a twentyfourhour match the camels were the only ships we had left
Nelson had won the championship laid the cornerstone of monuments
to himself all over English territory cut me off from France and
added three thousand sealubbers to my force for that number of
French sailors managed to swim ashore during the fight I manned the
camels with them immediately but it took them months to get their
land legs on and the amount of grog they demanded would have made a
quicksand of the Desert of Sahara all of which was embarrassing

But Napoleon did not show his embarrassment to those about him He
took upon himself the government of Egypt opened canals and
undertook to behave like a peaceable citizen for a while

I needed rest and I got it he said Sitting on the apex of the
pyramids I could see the whole world at my feet and whatever others
may say to the contrary it was there that I began to get a clear
view of my future It seemed to me that from that lofty altitude
chumming as I was with the forty centuries I have already alluded
to I could see two ways at once that every glance could penetrate
eternity but I realize now that what I really got was only a birds
eye view of the future I didnt see that speck of a St Helena If
I had in the height of my power I should have despatched an
expedition of sappers and miners to blow it up

Quiescence might as well be expected of a volcano however as from a
man of Bonapartes temperament and it was not long before he was
again engaged in warfare but not with his old success and finally
the plague having attacked his army Bonaparte too tenderhearted to
see it suffer leaving opium for the sick and instructions for
Kleber whom he appointed his successor set sail for France once
more in September 1799

Remember Kleber my boy he said in parting these Mussulmen are
a queer lot Be careful how you treat them If you behave like a
Christian youre lost I dont want to go back to France but I
must I got a view of the next three years from the top of Cheops
last night just before sunset and if that view is to be carried out
my presence in Paris is positively required The people are tired of
the addresses given by the old Directory and theyre seriously
thinking of getting out a new one and I want to be on hand either to
edit it or to secure my appointment to some lucrative consulship

Youa man of your genius after a consulship queried Kleber
astonished

Yes I have joined the officeseekers General but wait till you
hear what consulship it is The American consulgeneralship at
London is worth 70000 a year but minemine in contrast to that is
as golf to muggins

And what shall I tell the reporters about that Jaffa business if
they come here That poison scandal is sure to come up queried
Kleber

Treat them well Tell the truth if you know it andahinvite
them to dinner said Bonaparte Give them all the delicacies of
the season When you serve the poisson let it be with one s and
to make assurance doubly sure flavor the wines with the quickest you
have

Quickest what asked Kleber who was slightly obtuse

Humph sneered Napoleon On second thoughts if reporters bother
you take them swimming where the crocodiles are thickestonly
either dont bathe with them yourself or wear your mail bathing
suit Furthermore remember that what little of the army is left are
my children

What cried the obtuse Kleber All those

They are my children Kleber said Napoleon his voice shaking with
emotion I am young to be the head of so large a family but the
fact remains as I have said They may feel badly at my going away
and leaving them even with so pleasing a hired man as yourself but
comfort them let them play in the sand all they please and if they
want to know why papa has gone away tell them Ive gone to Paris to
buy them some candy

With these words Napoleon embarked and on the 16th of October Paris
received him with open arms That night the members of the Directory
came down with chills and fever



CHAPTER VII THE 19TH BRUMAIRECONSULTHE TUILERIESCAROLINE
1799



There is no question about my greatness now said Napoleon as he
meditated upon his position Even if the Directory were not jealous
and the people enthusiastic the number of relatives I have
discovered in the last ten days would show that things are going my
way I have had congratulatory messages from 800 aunts 950 uncles
and about 3800 needy cousins since my arrival It is queer how big a
family a lonely man finds he has when his star begins to twinkle
Even Joseph is glad see me now and I am told that the icecream men
serve little vanilla Napoleons at all the swell dinners Bourrienne
our time has come Get out my most threadbare uniform fray a few of
my collars at the edges and shoot a few holes in my hat Ill go
out and take a walk along the Avenue de lOpera where the people can
see me

There isnt any such street in Paris yet General said Bourrienne
getting out his Paris guidebook

Well there ought to be said Napoleon

What streets are there I must be seen or Ill be forgotten

Whats the matter with a lounge in front of the Luxembourg That
will make a contrast that cant help affect the populace You the
conqueror illclad unshaven and with a hat full of bulletholes
walking outside the palace with the incompetent Directors lodged
comfortably inside will make a scene that is bound to give the
people food for thought

Well said cried Bonaparte Here are the pistols go out into the
woods and prepare the hat Ill fray the collars

This was done and the effect was instantaneous The public
perceived the point and sympathy ran so high that a public dinner
was offered to the returned warrior

I have no use for pomp Mr Toastmaster he said as he rose to
speak at this banquet I am not a good afterdinner speaker but I
want the people of France to know that I am grateful for this meal
I rise only to express the thanks of a hungry man for this timely
contribution to his inner self and I wish to add that I should not
willingly have added to the already heavy tax upon the pockets of a
patriotic people by accepting this dinner if it were not for the
demands of nature It is only the direst necessity that brings me
here for one must eat and I cannot beg

These remarks as may well be imagined sent a thrill of enthusiasm
throughout France and filled the Directory with consternation The
only cloud upon Bonapartes horizon was a slight coldness which arose
between himself and Josephine She had gone to meet him on his
arrival at Frejus but by some odd mistake took the road to Burgundy
while Napoleon came by way of Lyons They therefore missed each
other

I could not help it she said when Napoleon jealously chided her
Ive travelled very little and the geography of France always did
puzzle me

It is common sense that should have guided you not knowledge of
geography When I sail into Port you sail into Burgundyyou the
only woman I ever loved cried Napoleon passionately Hereafter
madame for the sake of our stepchildren be more circumspect At
this time I cannot afford a trip to South Dakota for the purpose of a
quiet divorce nor would a public one pay at this juncture but I
give you fair warning that I shall not forget this escapade and once
we are settled in thethe Whatistobe I shall remember and another
only woman I have ever loved will dawn upon your horizon

Bonaparte was now besieged by all the military personages of France
His home became the Mecca of soldiers of all kinds and in order to
hold their interest the hero of the day found it necessary to draw
somewhat upon the possessions which the people were convinced he was
without Never an admirer of consistency France admired this more
than ever It was a paradox that this povertystricken soldier
should entertain so lavishly and the people admired the nerve which
prompted him to do it supposing many of them that his creditors
were men of a speculative nature who saw in the man a goodpaying
future investment

Thus matters went until the evening of the 17th Brumaire when
Napoleon deemed that he had been on parade long enough and that the
hour demanded action

This is the month of Bromide he said

Brumaire whispered Bourrienne

I said Bromide retorted Napoleon and the people are asleep
Bromide has that effect That is why I call it Bromide and I have
as much right to name my months as any one else Wherefore I repeat
this is the month of Bromide and the people are asleep I will now
wake them up The garrisons of Paris and the National Guard have
asked me to review them and Im going to do it and Ive a new set
of tictacs

Tactics General tactics implored Bourrienne

There is no use discussing words Mr Secretary retorted
Bonaparte It has always been the criticism of my opponents that I
didnt know a tactic from a bedtickwell perhaps I dont and for
that reason I am not going to talk about tactics with which I am not
familiar but I shall speak of tictacs which is a game I have played
from infancy and of which I am a master Im going to get up a new
government Bourrienne Summon all the generals in town including
Bernadotte Theyre all with me except Bernadotte and hell be so
unpleasant about what I tell him to do that hell make all the others
so mad theyll stick by me through thick and thin If theres any
irritating work to be done let Joseph do it He has been well
trained in the art of irritation I have seen Sieyes and Ducos and
have promised them front seats in the new government which my tictacs
are to bring about Barras wont have the nerve to oppose me and
Gohier and Moulin have had the ague for weeks Well have the
review and my first order to the troops will be to carry humps the
second will be to forward march and the third will involve the
closing of a long lease in my name of the Luxembourg Palace with a
salary connected with every room in the house

It is needless for us to go into details The review came off as
Napoleon wished and his orders were implicitly obeyed with the
result that on the 19th of Brumaire the Directory was filed away and
Napoleon Bonaparte with Sieyes and Ducos as fellowconsuls were
called upon to save France from anarchy

Well Josephine said Bonaparte on the evening of the 19th as he
put his boots outside of the door of his new apartment in the
Luxembourg this is better than living in a flat and I must confess
I find the featherbeds of the palace more inviting than a couch of
sand under a datetree in Africa

And what are you going to do next asked Josephine

Ha laughed Napoleon blowing out the candle Theres a womans
curiosity for you The continuation of this entertaining story my
love will be found in volume two of Bourriennes attractive history
From the Towpath to the Tuileries now in course of preparation and
for sale by all accredited agents at the low price of ten francs a
copy

With this remark Napoleon jumped into bed and on the authority of M
le Comte de Q at this time Charge a Affaires of the Luxembourg and
later on Janitor of the Tuileries was soon dreaming of the Empire

The Directory overthrown Bonaparte turned his attention to the
overthrow of the Consulate

Gentlemen he said to his fellowconsuls I admire you personally
very much and no doubt you will both of you agree in most matters
but as I am fearful lest you should disagree on matters of
importance and so break that beautiful friendship which I am pleased
to see that you have for each other I shall myself cast a deciding
vote in all matters large or small This will enable you to avoid
differences and to continue in that spirit of amity which I have
always so much admired in your relations You can work as hard as
you please but before committing yourselves to anything consult me
not each other What is a Consul for if not for a consultation

Against this Sieyes and Ducos were inclined to rebel but Bonaparte
soon dispelled their opposition Ringing his bell he summoned an
aidedecamp whispered a few words in his ear and then leaned
quietly back in his chair The aidedecamp retired and two minutes
later the army stationed without began shouting most enthusiastically
for Bonaparte The General walked to the window and bowed and the
air was rent with huzzas and vivas

I guess hes right whispered Sieyes as the shouting grew more and
more vigorous

Guess again growled Ducos

You were saying gentlemen said Bonaparte returning

That we are likely to have rain before long said Sieyes quickly

I shouldnt be surprised returned Napoleon and Id advise you
laymen to provide yourselves with umbrellas when the rain begins I
as a soldier shall not feel the inclemency of the weather that is
about to set in And bytheway Sieyes please prepare a new
Constitution for France providing for a singleheaded commission to
rule the country Ducos you need rest Pray take a vacation until
further notice Ill attend to matters here On your way downstairs
knock at Bourriennes door and tell him I want to see him I have a
few more memoirs for his book

With these words Bonaparte adjourned the meeting Sieyes went home
and drew up the Constitution and M Ducos retired to private life
for rest The Constitution of Sieyes was a clever instrument but
Bonaparte rendered it unavailing It provided for three consuls but
one of them was practically given all the power and the others
became merely his clerks

This is as it should be said Bonaparte when by 4000000 votes
the Constitution was ratified by the people These threeheaded
governments are apt to be failures particularly when two of the
heads are worthless Cambaceres makes a firstrate bottleholder
and Lebrun is a competent stenographer but as for directing France
in the line of her destiny they are of no use I will now move into
the Tuileries I hate pomp as I have often said but Paris must be
dazzled We cant rent the palace for a hotel and its a pity to
let so much space go to waste Josephine pack up your trunk and
tell Bourrienne to have a truckman here at eleven sharp Tomorrow
night we will dine at the Tuileries and for Heavens sake see to it
that the bottles are cold and the birds are hot For the sake of the
Republic also that we may not appear too ostentatious in our living
you may serve cream with the demitasse

Once established in the Tuileries Bonaparte became in reality the
king and his family who had for a long time gone abegging began to
assume airs of importance which were impressive His sisters began
to be invited out and were referred to by the society papers as most
eligible young persons Their manner however was somewhat in
advance of their position Had their brother been actually king and
themselves of royal birth they could not have conducted themselves
more haughtily This was never so fully demonstrated as when at a
ball given in their honor at Marseilles an old friend of the family
who had been outrageously snubbed by Caroline asked her why she wore
her nose turned up so high

Because my brother is reigning in Paris she retorted

In this she but voiced the popular sentiment and the remark was
received with applause and later Murat who had distinguished
himself as a military man desirous of allying himself with the
rising house demanded her hand in marriage

You cried the First Consul Why Murat your father kept an
inn

I know it said Murat But what of that

My blood must not be mixed with yours thats what said Bonaparte

Very well Mr Bonaparte said Murat angrily let it be so but I
tell you one thing When you see the bills Caroline is running up
youll find it would have been money in your pocket to transfer her
to me As for the inn business my governor never served such
atrocious meals at his tabledhote as you serve to your guests at
state banquets and dont you forget it

Whether these arguments overcame Bonapartes scruples or not is not
known but a few days later he relented and Caroline became the wife
of Murat

I never regretted it said Bonaparte some years later Murat was
a good brotherinlaw to me and he taught me an invaluable lesson in
the giving of state banquets which was that one portion is always
enough for three And as for parting with my dear sister that did
not disturb me very much for truly Talleyrand Caroline was the
only woman I never loved



CHAPTER VIII THE ALPSTHE EMPIRETHE CORONATION
18001804



Observe said Bonaparte now that he was seated on the consular
throne that one of my biographers states that under a man of
ordinary vigor this new Constitution of Sieyes and another our
government would be free and popular but that under myself it has
become an unlimited monarchy That man is right I am now a
potentate of the most potent kind I got a letter from the Bourbons
last night requesting me to restore them to the throne Two years
ago they wouldnt have given me their autographs for my collection
but now they want me to get up from my seat in this car of state and
let them sit down

And you replied asked Josephine

That I didnt care for Bourbonrye suits me better laughed the
Consul unless I can get Scotch which I prefer at all times
Feeling this way I cannot permit Louis to come back yet awhile
Meantime in the hope of replenishing our cellars with a few bottles
of Glenlivet I will write a letter of pacification to George III
one of the most gorgeous rex in Madame Tussauds collection of living
potentates

This Bonaparte did asking the English king if he hadnt had enough
war for the present George through the eyes of his ministers
perceived Bonapartes point and replied that he was very desirous
for peace himself but that at present the market seemed to be
cornered and that therefore the war must go on This reply amused
Napoleon

It suits me to the ground he said addressing Talleyrand A year
of peace would interfere materially with my future If Paris were
Philadelphia it would be another thing There one may restthere
is no popular demand for excitementPenn was mightier than the
swordbut here one has to be in a broil constantly to be a chef one
must be eternally cooking and the results must be of the kind that
requires extra editions of the evening papers The day the newsboys
stop shouting my name my sun will set for the last time Even now
the populace are murmuring for nothing startling has occurred this
week which reminds me I wish to see Fouche Send him here

Talleyrand sent for the Minister of Police who responded to the
summons

Fouche said Bonaparte sternly what are we here for salary or
glory

Glory General

Precisely Now as head of the Police Department are you aware
that no attempt to assassinate me has been made for two weeks

Yes General but

Has the assassin appropriation run out Have the assassins struck
for higher wages or are you simply careless demanded the First
Consul I warn you sir that I wish no excuses and I will add
that unless an attempt is made on my life before ten oclock to
night you lose your place The French people must be kept
interested in this performance and how the deuce it is to be done
without advertising I dont know Go and remember that I shall be
at home to assassins on Thursdays of alternate weeks until further
notice

Your Consulships wishes shall be respected said Fouche with a
low bow But I must say one word in my own behalf You were to
have had a dynamite bomb thrown at you yesterday by one of my
employes but the brave fellow who was to have stood between you and
death disappointed me He failed to turn up at the appointed hour
and so of course the assault didnt come off

Couldnt you find a substitute demanded Bonaparte

I could not said Fouche There arent many persons in Paris who
care for that kind of employment Theyd rather shovel snow

You are a gay stagemanager you are snapped Bonaparte My
brother Joseph is in town and yet you say you couldnt find a man to
be hit by a bomb Leave me Fouche You give me the ennuis

Fouche departed with Talleyrand to whom he expressed his indignation
at the First Consuls reprimand

He insists upon an attempted assassination every week he said
and I tell you Talleyrand it isnt easy to get these things up
The market is long on real assassins fellows whod kill him for the
mere fun of hearing his last words but when it comes to playing to
the galleries with a mock attempt with real consequences to the
wouldbe murderers they fight shy of it

Nevertheless Fouche learned from the interview with Bonaparte that
the First Consul was not to be trifled with and hardly a day passed
without some exciting episode in this line in which of course
Napoleon always came out unscathed and much endeared to the populace
This however could not go on forever The fickle French soon
wearied of the series of unsuccessful attempts on the Consuls life
and some began to suspect the true state of affairs

Theyre on to our scheme General said Fouche after a while
Youve got to do something new

What would you suggest asked Napoleon wearily

Cant you write a book of poems or a threevolume novel suggested
Talleyrand

Or resign and let Sieyes run things for a while said Fouche If
they had another Consul for a few months theyd appreciate what a
vaudeville show they lost in you

Id rather cross the Alps said Bonaparte I dont like to
resign Moving is such a nuisance and I must say I find the
Tuileries a very pleasant place of abode Its more fun than you can
imagine rummaging through the late kings old bureaudrawers
Suppose I get up a new army and lead it over the Alps

Just the thing said Talleyrand Only it will be a very snowy
trip

Im used to snowballs said Napoleon his mind reverting to the
episode which brought his career at Brienne to a close Just order
an army and a mule and Ill set out Meanwhile Fouche see that the
Bourbons have a conspiracy to be unearthed in time for the Sunday
newspapers every week during my absence I think it would be well
too to keep a warcorrespondent at work in your office night and
day writing despatches about my progress Give him a good book on
Hannibals trip to study and let him fill in a column or two every
day with anecdotes about myself and at convenient intervals
unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Josephine may come in handy
Let it be rumored often that I have been overwhelmed by an avalanche
in short keep the interest up

So it was that Bonaparte set out upon his perilous expedition over
the Great St Bernard On the 15th day of May 1800 the task of
starting the army in motion was begun and on the 18th every column
was in full swing Lannes with an advance guard armed with snow
shovels took the lead and Bonaparte commanding the rear guard of
35000 men and the artillery followed

Soldiers he cried as they came near to the snowbound heights
we cannot have our plumcake without its frosting Like children
we will have the frosting first and the cake later Lannes and his
followers have not cleaned the snow off as thoroughly as I had hoped
but I fancy he has done the best he can and it is not for us to
complain Let us on The uptrip will be cold and tedious but once
on the summit of yonder icy ridge we can seat ourselves comfortably
on our guns and slide down into the lovely valleys on the other side
like a band of merry schoolboys on toboggans Above all do not
forget the chief duty of a soldier in times of peril In spite of
the snow and the ice in spite of the blizzard and the sleet keep
cool and furthermore remember that in this climate if your ears
dont hurt its a sign they are freezing En avant Nous sommes le
peuple

The army readily responded to such hopeful words and as Bonaparte
manifested quite as much willingness to walk as the meanest soldier
disdaining to ride except occasionally and even then on the back of
a mule he became their idol

He does not spare himself any more than he does us said one of his
soldiers and he can pack a snowball with the best of us

The General catered too to the amusement of his troops and the
brasses of the band broke the icy stillness of the great hills
continually

Musics the thing he cried many years later and when we got to
the top we had the most original roofgarden you ever saw It was
most inspiring and the only thing that worried me at all was as to
how Fouche was conducting our anecdote and assassination enterprise
at home Once on top of the Alps the descent was easy We simply
lay down on our arms and slid Down the mountainside we thundered
and the Austrians when they observed our impetus gave way before
us and the first thing I knew I skated slambang into the Empire
Our avalanchian descent subjugated Italy frightened the Englishmen
to Alexandria where in the absence of a wellorganized force they
managed to triumph scared the Pope so thoroughly that he was willing
to sign anything I wished and best of all after a few petty
delays convinced the French people that I was too big a man for a
mere consulship It was my chamoislike agility in getting down the
Alps that really made me Emperor As for the army it fought nobly
It was so thoroughly chilled by the Alpine venture that it fought
desperately to get warm My grenadiers congealed to their very
souls went where the fire was hottest They seized bombshells
while they were yet in the air warmed their hands upon them and
then threw them back into the enemys camp where they exploded with
great carnage They did not even know when they were killed so
benumbed by the cold had they become In short those days on the
Alps made us invincible No wonder then that in 1804 when I got
permanently back to Paris I found the people ready for an emperor
They were bloody years those from 1800 to 1804 but it was not
entirely my fault I shed very little myself but the English and
the Austrians and the royalist followers would have it so and I had
to accommodate them I did not wish to execute the Duc dEnghien
but he would interfere with Fouche by getting up conspiracies on his
own account when I had given the conspiracy contract to one of my
own ministers The poor fellow had to die It was a case of no die
no Empire and I thought it best for the French people that they
should have an Empire

Those who criticise Bonapartes acts in these years should consider
these words and remember that the great warrior in no case did any
of the killing himself

It was on the 18th of May 1804 that the Empire was proclaimed and
Napoleon assumed his new title amid great rejoicing

Now for the coronation he said This thing must go off in style
Fouche Whom shall I have to crown me

Well said Fouche if you are after a sensation Id send for
Louis de Bourbon if you want it to go off easily Id send for your
old hatter in the Rue de Victoire if you want to give it a
ceremonial touch Id send for the Pope but on the whole I rather
think Id do it myself You picked it up yourself why not put it on
your own head

Good idea returned Bonaparte And highly original You may
increase your salary a hundred francs a week Fouche Ill crown
myself but I think it ought to come as a surprise dont you

Yes said Fouche That is if you can surprise the French people
which I doubt If you walked into Notre Dame tomorrow on your
hands with the crown of France on one foot and the diadem of Italy
on the other the people wouldnt be a bit surprisedyoure always
doing such things

Nevertheless said Napoleon well surprise them Send word to
the Pope that I want to see him officially on December 2d at Notre
Dame If he hesitates about coming tell him Ill walk over and
bring him myself the first clear day we have

This plan was followed out to the letter and the Pope leaving Rome
on the 5th of November entered Paris to crown the Emperor and
Empress of the French on December 2 1804 as requested What
subsequently followed the world knows Just as the Pope was about to
place the imperial diadem on the brow of Bonaparte the Emperor
seized it and with his own hands placed it there

Excuse me your Holiness he said as he did so but the joke is
on you This is my crown and I think Im a big enough man to hang
it up where it belongs

Pius VII was much chagrined but like the good man that he was he
did not show it nor did he resent the Emperors second interference
when it came to the crowning of Josephine The coronation over
Napoleon and Josephine turned to the splendid audience and marched
down the centre aisle to the door where they entered a superb golden
carriage in which amid the plaudits of the people they drove to the
Tuileries

Ahat last said Bonaparte as he entered the Palace I have got
there The thing to do now is to stay there Ah me he added
with a sigh These Frenchthese French they are as fickle as the
only woman I have ever loved Bytheway Josephine what was it you
asked me on the way down the aisle The people howled so I couldnt
hear you

I only asked you ifhere the Empress hesitated

Well If what frowned the Emperor

If my crown was on straight returned Josephine

Madame said the Emperor sternly when you are prompted to ask
that question again remember who gave you that crown and when you
remember that it was I remember also that when I give anything to
anybody I give it to them straight

Here the Emperors frown relaxed and he burst out into laughter

But that was a bad break of the organist he said

Which was that asked Josephine

Whydidnt you notice when the Pope came in he played Tiara Boom
deay said Bonaparte with a roar It was awfulI shall have to
send him a pourboire



CHAPTER IX THE RISE OF THE EMPIRE
18051810



What next asked Fouche the morning after the coronation as he
entered the Emperors cabinet

Breakfast returned Bonaparte laconically what did you suppose
You didnt think I was going swimming in the Seine did you

I never think retorted Fouche

Thats evident said Napoleon Is the archtreasurer of my empire
up yet The Empress is going shopping and wants an appropriation

He is Your Majesty said Fouche looking at his memorandumbook
He rose at 730 dressed as usual parted his hair on the lefthand
side and breakfasted at eight At 815 he read the Moniteur and
sneezed twice while perusing the second column of the fourth page

What is the meaning of these petty details cried the Emperor
impatiently

I merely wished to show Your Majesty that as the Sherlock Holmes of
this administration I am doing my duty There isnt a man in France
who is not being shadowed in your behalf returned the minister of
police

The Emperor looked out of the window then turning to Fouche he
said the stern impatient look fading into softness Pardon my
irritability Fouche You are a genius and I appreciate you though
I may not always show it I didnt sleep well last night and in
consequence I am not unduly amiable this morning

Your Majesty is not ill I trust said Fouche with a show of
anxiety

No replied the Emperor The fact is old man IahI forgot to
take the crown off when I went to bed

Thus began that wonderful reign which forms so many dazzling pages in
modern history Bonapartes first act after providing lucrative
positions for his family was to write another letter couched in
language of a most fraternal nature to the King of England asking
for peace

Dear Cousin George he wrote you have probably read in the
newspapers by this time that Im working under a new alias and I
hope you will like it as well as I do Its great fun but there is
one feature of it all that I dont like I hate to be fighting with
my new cousins all the time and particularly with you whom I have
always loved deeply though secretly Now my dear George let me
ask you whats the use of a prolonged fight Youve waxed fat in ten
years and so have I Weve painted the earth red between us Why
cant we be satisfied Why should our relations continue to be
strained Ive got some personal relations Id like to have
strained but I can attend to them myself Let US have peace I
dont want too big a piece Give me enough and you can have the
rest Let us restore the entente cordiale and go about our business
without any further scrapping Let dogs delight to bark and bite
as your illustrious poet hath it for tis their nature to As for
us the earth is large enough for both You take the Western
Hemisphere and Ill keep this Russia and the others can have what
remains

Yours truly
NAPOLEON
Emperor of the French

PSI enclose a stamped and directed envelope for a reply and if
I dont get it inside of two weeks Ill come over and smoke you out


To this peaceseeking communication England through her ministers
replied to the effect that she wanted peace as much as France did
but that she could not enter into it without the consent of Russia

That settles it said Napoleon Its to be war Im willing to
divide creation with England but twos company and threes a crowd
and the Russian Bear must keep his paws off I will go to Italy
Bourrienne collect a few more thrones and then well get to work on
a new map of Europe Russia never did look well or graceful on the
existing maps It makes the continent look lopsided and Germany
and Austria need trimming down a bit I propose to shove Russia over
into Asia annex Germany and Austria to France drop Turkey into the
Bosporus and tow England farther north and hitch her on to the north
pole Wire the Italians to get out their iron crown and dust it off
Ill take a run down to Milan in May and give my coronation
performance there Such a good show as that of December 2nd ought to
be taken on the road

The latter part of this plan was fulfilled to the letter and on the
20th of May 1805 Bonaparte and Josephine were crowned King and
Queen of Italy at Milan

Now my dear said Bonaparte after the ceremony hereafter we
must drop the first person singular I and assume the dignity of the
editorial WE Emperors and editors alike are entitled to the
distinction Its a sign of plurality which is often quite as
effective as a majority Furthermore you and We can do it
logically for we are several persons all at once what with the
assortment of thrones that we have acquired in the secondhand shops
of the earth all of which must be sat on

Crowned King of Italy leaving Eugene de Beauharnais as Viceroy at
Milan Napoleon returned to Paris

Now that We have replenished our stock of crowns he said to his
generals We will make a tour of Germany Weve always had a great
desire to visit Berlin and nows our imperial chance Tell the
archtreasurer to telephone Frederick to reserve his best palace for
our occupancy

Then began a series of warclouds which kept the European
correspondents of the American Sunday newspapers in a state of
anxious turmoil for years In our own time a single warcloud is
enough to drive a capable correspondent to the verge of desperation
but when we consider that Bonaparte was letting loose the clouds of
war in all sections of Europe simultaneously it is easy to
understand how it has come about that we of today who study history
in the daily press have the most vague ideas as to the motives of
the quarrelling potentates at the beginning of this century

For instance after starting for Berlin Bonaparte makes a diversion
at Ulm and ends for the moment by capturing Vienna and taking up his
abode in the castle of Schonbrunn the home of the Austrian Caesars
Then the scene of activity is transferred to Cape Trafalgar where
Nelson routs the French fleet and Bonaparte is for an instant
discomfited but above which he rises superior

If We had been there ourself Wed have felt worse about it he
said But We were not and therefore it is none of our funeral
and after all what has it accomplished The hoard of aldermen of
London have named a square in London after the cape and stuck up a
monument to Nelson in the middle of it which is the rendezvous of
all the strikers and socialists of England Some day Well go over
to Trafalgar Square ourself and put a new face on that statue and it
will bear some resemblance to us unless We are mistaken When We
get back to Paris likewise We will issue an imperial decree
ordering a new navy for these capable admirals of ours more suited to
their abilities and M Villeneuve shall have his choice between a
camel and a gravyboat for his flagship

Nevertheless the Emperor realized that his prestige had received a
blow which it was necessary to retrieve

Paris doesnt like it wrote Fouche and the general sentiment
seems to be that your show isnt what it used to be You need a
victory just about now and if you could manage to lose a leg on the
field of battle it would strengthen your standing with your
subjects

Good Fouche murmured the Emperor to himself as he read the
despatch You are indeed watchful of our interests It shall be
done as you suggest even if it costs a leg We will engage the
Russians at Austerlitz

On the 2d of December this battle of the Emperors was fought and
resulted in a most glorious victory for the French arms

We scored seven touchdowns in the first five minutes and at the
end of the first half were ten goals to the good said Bonaparte
writing home to Josephine and all without my touching the ball
The Emperor of Germany and the excessively smart Alexander of Russia
sat on deadhead hill and watched the game with interest but in
spite of my repeated efforts to get them to do so were utterly
unwilling to cover my bets on the final result The second half
opened brilliantly Murat made a flying wedge with our centrerush
threw himself impetuously upon Kutusoff the Russian halfback
pushed the enemy back beyond the goal posts and the game was
practically over The emperors on deadhead hill gave it up then and
there and the championship of 1805 is ours We understand England
disputes this but we are willing to play them on neutral ground at
any time They can beat us in aquatic sports but given a good
hard realestate field we can do them up whether Wellington plays
or not

It was a glorious victory wrote Fouche to the Emperor and it has
had a great effect on Paris You are called the Hinkey of your time
but I still think you erred in not losing that leg Cant you work
in another coronation somewhere You havent acquired a new throne
in over six months and the people are beginning to murmur

Bonapartes reply was immediate

Am too busy to go thronehunting Send my brother Joseph down to
Naples as my agent Theres a crown there Let him put it on and
tell Paris that he is my proxy Joseph may not want to go because of
the cholera scare but tell him We wish it and if he still demurs
whisper the word Alp in his ear Hell go when he hears that word
particularly if you say it in that short sharp and decisive manner
to which it so readily lends itself

These instructions were carried out and Paris was for the time being
satisfied but to clinch matters as it were the Emperor went still
further and married Eugene de Beauharnais to the daughter of the
King of Bavaria conferred a few choice principalities upon his
sister Eliza and sending for Prince Borghese one of the most
aristocratic gentlemen of Italy gave him in marriage to his sister
Pauline

Were getting into good society by degrees wrote the Emperor to
the Empress and now that you are the motherinlaw of a real
prince kindly see that your manner is imperious to the extreme
degree and stop serving pie at state banquets

The succeeding two years were but repetitions of the first year of
the Empire Bonaparte proceeded from one victory to another
Prussia was humbled The French Emperor occupied Berlin and as he
had done in Italy levied upon the art treasures of that city for the
enrichment of Paris

Well have quite a Salon if we go on said Bonaparte

Anybodyd think you were getting up a corner in oil said
Frederick ruefully as he watched the packers at work boxing his
most treasured paintings for shipment

We am getting up a corner in all things retorted Bonaparte
Paris will soon be the Boston of Europeit will be the Hub of the
Universe

You might leave me something said the Prussian king I havent
an old master left

Well never mind said Napoleon soothingly Well be a young
master to you Now go to bed like a good fellow and take a good
rest Theres a delegation of Poles waiting for me outside They
think We am going to erect a telegraph system to Russia and they
want employment

As operators asked Frederick sadly

No stupid returned Napoleon as Poles

The Prussian left the room in tears To his great regret policy
compelled Bonaparte to decline the petition of the Polanders to be
allowed to rehabilitate themselves as a nation As we have seen he
was a man of peace and many miles away from home at that and hence
had no desire to further exasperate Russia by meddling in an affair
so close to the Czars heart This diplomatic foresight resulted in
the Peace of Tilsit The Czar appreciating Bonapartes delicacy in
the matter of Poland was quite won over and consented to an
interview by means of which a basis might be reached upon which all
might rest from warfare Tilsit was chosen as the place of meeting
and fearing lest they might be interrupted by reporters the two
emperors decided to hold their conference upon a raft anchored in the
middle of the river Niemen It must be remembered that tugs had not
been invented at this time so that the raft was comparatively safe
from those Boswells of the news as reporters have been called
Fouche was very anxious about this decision however

Look out for yourself my dear Emperor he wrote Wear a cork
suit or insist that the raft shall be plentifully supplied with
lifepreservers Those Eastern emperors would like nothing better
than to have you founder in the Niemen

We are not afraid Napoleon replied If the craft sinks We shall
swim ashore on Alexanders back Nevertheless all other historians
to the contrary Bonaparte did wear a cork suit beneath his uniform
We have this on the authority of the nephew of the valet of the late
Napoleon III who had access to the private papers of this wonderful
family

Nothing disastrous occurred upon this occasion in spite of the
temptation thrown in Alexanders way to sink the raft and thus rid
the world of a dangerous rival to his supremacy The conference
resulted in a treaty of peace concluded on the 7th of July 1807
and by it a few more thrones were added to the Bonaparte collection
Jerome who had been trying to make a living as a music teacher in
America having been divorced from his American wife and married to
another was made King of Westphalia

Having made a failure in the West my dear brother said Bonaparte
what could be more appropriate

Louis was made King of Holland and Josephs kingship of Naples was
fully recognized and further Bonaparte was enabled to return to
Paris and show himself to the citizens of that fickle city who were
getting restive under Josephines rule

They like Josephine well enough wrote Fouche but the men prefer
to have you here The fact that things run smoothly under a womans
rule is giving the female suffragists a great boom and the men say
that domestic life is being ruined Cooks are scarce having
deserted the kitchen for the primaries and altogether the outlook is
effeminate Therefore come back as soon as you can for if you
dont the first thing we know the women will be voting and youll
find youll have to give up your seat to a lady

The Emperors return to Paris was marked by great rejoicing
particularly by the large number of hatters and laundresses and
stableboys whom he had in the meantime paid for their early services
by making them dukes and duchesses The court was magnificent and
entirely new No secondhand nobles were allowed within the sacred
circle and the result was one of extreme splendor In a small way
to maintain the interest which he had inspired as well as to keep up
the discipline of his army a few conquests including those of Spain
and Portugal were indulged in Joseph was removed from a
comfortable warm throne at Naples and made King of Spain and Murat
was substituted for him at Naples The Emperors elder brother did
not like the change but submitted as gracefully as ever

Naples was extremely comfortable he said but this Madrid
position is not at all to my taste I prefer macaroni to garlic and
I cannot endure these Carmencita dancesthey remind me too much of
the greenapple season in the old Corsican days However what my
brother wills I do merely from force of habitnot that I fear him
or consider myself bound to obey him mind you but because I am
averse to family differences One must yield and I have always been
the selfsacrificing member of the family Hes put me here and I
hope to remain

This promotion of Joseph was a misstep for one who desired peace and
Bonaparte soon found another war with Austria on the tapis because of
it Emperor Francis Joseph jealous perhaps of the copyright on his
name declined to recognize King Joseph of Spain Whereupon
Bonaparte again set out for Austria where on the 6th of July 1809
Austria having recognized the strength of Bonapartes arguments
backed up as they were by an overwhelming force of men each worthy
of a marshals baton and all confident under the new regime of
some day securing it an armistice was agreed upon and on the 14th
of October a treaty satisfactory to France was signed

If I have to come back again my dear Emperor Joseph Bonaparte
said as he set out for Paris it will be for the purpose of giving
you a new position which you may not like so well as the neat and
rather gaudy sinecure you now hold

Which is added the Austrian

Ill bring you a snowshovel and set you to clearing off the steps

What steps queried the Austrian anxiously

The backsteppes of Russia replied Napoleon sternly The only
thing that keeps me from doing it now is that IahI hate to do
anything unkind to the father ofahyour daughter MarieLouise
whom I met at the dance last night and who between you and me
looks remarkably like the only woman I ever loved



CHAPTER X THE FALL OF THE EMPIRE
18101814



Just before the opening of the year 1810 which marked the beginning
of Bonapartes decay Fouche demanded an audience

Well Fouche said the Emperor what now

This Empire cant go much further Your Majesty unless more novelty
is introduced Ive had my men out all through France taking notes
and theres but one opinion among em all Youve got to do
something new or stop the show If youd only done what I suggested
at Austerlitz and lost a leg it would have been different The
people dont ask much songanddance business from a onelegged man

We compromised with you there retorted Napoleon At Ratisbon our
imperial foot was laid up for a week

Yesbut you didnt lose it returned Fouche Cant you see the
difference If youd lost it and come home without it thered have
been evidence of your suffering As it is do you know what your
enemies are saying about your foot

We do not said the Emperor sternly What do they say

Well the Bourbons say you stepped on it running away from the
enemys guns and the extreme Republicans say your wound is nothing
but gout and the result of high undemocratic living Now my dear
sirSire I meanI take a great deal of interest in this Empire
It pays me my salary and Ive had charge of the calcium lights for
some time and I dont want our lustre dimmed but it will be dimmed
unless as I have already told you a million times we introduce some
new act on our programme 1492 didnt succeed on its music or its
jokes or its living pictures It was the introduction of novelties
every week that kept it on the boards for four hundred years

Wellwhat do you propose asked Bonaparte recognizing the truth
of Fouches words

IahI think you ought to get married said Fouche

We am married youyouidiot cried Bonaparte

Well marry again said Fouche Youve been giving other people
away at a great rate for several yearswhats the matter with
acquiring a real princess for yourself

You advise bigamy do you asked Bonaparte scornfully

Not on your life returned Fouche but a real elegant divorce
followed by an imperial wedding would rattle the bones of this blase
old Paris as they havent been rattled since Robespierres day

Bonaparte reddened then rising from the throne and putting his hand
to the side of his mouth he said in a low agitated tone

Close the door Fouche Close the door and come here We want to
whisper something to you

The minister did as he was bidden

Fouche old boy chuckled the Emperor in the ear of his rascally
aideFouche youre a mindreader Weve been thinking of just
that very thing for some timein fact ever since We met that old
woman Emperor Francis Joseph Hed make an elegant motherinlaw

Precisely said Fouche His daughter MarieLouise an archduchess
by birth is the one I had selected for you History will no doubt
say that I oppose this match and publicly perhaps I may seem to do
so but you will understand my dear Sire that this opposition will
serve as it is designed to serve as an advertisement of our
enterprise and without advertising we might as well put up the
shutters Shall weahannounce the attraction to the public

Not yet said Napoleon We must get rid of our leading lady
before we bring on the understudy

It is a sad chapter in the history of this eminent man wherein is
told the heartbreaking story of his sacrificethe giving up through
sheer love of his country of the only woman he had ever loved and we
should prefer to pass it over in silence We allude to it here
merely to show that it was brought about by the exigencies of his
office and that it was nothing short of heroic selfabnegation which
led this faithful lover of his adopted native land to put the
beautiful Josephine away from him He had builded an Empire for an
opera bouffe people and he was resolved to maintain it at any cost

In March 1810 Bonaparte having in his anxiety to spare the
feelings of the divorced Josephine wooed MarieLouise by proxy in
the person of Marshal Berthier met his new fiancee at Soissons

It is three months since we lost our beloved Josephine he said to
Fouche with tears in his voice but the wound is beginning to heal
We fear we shall never love again but for the sake of the Empire we
will now begin to take notice once more We will meet our bride
elect at Soissons and escort her to Paris ourself

This was done and on the 2nd of April 1810 MarieLouise became
Empress of France Josephine meanwhile had retired to Malmaison
with alimony of 3000000 francs

Fouche was delighted Paris was provided with conversation enough for
a year in any event and Bonaparte found it possible to relax a
little in his efforts to inspire interest His main anxiety in the
ensuing year was as to his family affairs His brothers did not turn
out so highly successful as professional kings as he had hoped and
it became necessary to depose Louis the King of Holland and place him
under arrest Joseph too desired to resign the Spanish throne
which he had found to be far from comfortable and there was much
else to restore Bonapartes early proneness to irritability nor was
his lot rendered any more happy by MarieLouises expressed
determination not to go to tea with Josephine at Malmaison on Sunday
nights as the Emperor wished her to do

You may go if you please said she but I shall not Family
reunions are never agreeable and the circumstances of this are so
peculiar that even if they had redeeming features this one would be
impossible

We call that rebelliondont you asked Bonaparte of Fouche

No said Fouche Shes right and its for your good If she and
Josephine got chumming and compared notes Im rather of the opinion
that thered be another divorce

Fouches reply so enraged the Emperor that he dismissed him from his
post and the Empire began to fall

I leave you at your zenith Sire said Fouche You send me to
Rome as governor in the hope that I will get the Roman fever and die
I know it well but let me tell you that the reaction is nearly due
and with the loss of your stage manager the farce begins to pall
Farewell If you can hook yourself on to your zenith and stay there
do so but that you will I dont think

It was as Fouche said Perplexities now arose which bade fair to
overwhelm the Emperor For a moment they cleared away when the
infant son of MarieLouise and Bonaparte was born but they broke out
with increasing embarrassment immediately after

What has your soninlaw named his boy Francis Joseph asked
Alexander of Russia

King of Rome returned the Austrian

What cried Alexander and not after youor me The coxcomb I
will make war upon him

This anecdote is here given to the world for the first time It is
generally supposed that the rupture of friendly relations between
Alexander and Bonaparte grew out of other causes but the truth is as
indicated in this story Had Fouche been at hand Bonaparte would
never have made the mistake but it was made and war was declared

After a succession of hardfought battles the invading army of the
Emperor entered Moscow but Napoleons spirit was broken

These Russian names are giving us paresis he cried How I ever
got here I dont know and I find myself unprovided with a return
ticket The names of the Russian generals to say nothing of those
of their rivers and cities make my head ache and have ruined my
teeth I fear Davoust that I have had my day It was easy to call
on the Pollylukes to surrender in Africa it never unduly taxed my
powers of enunciation to speak the honeyed names of Italy the
Austrian tongue never bothered me but when I try to inspire my
soldiers with remarks like On to Smolensko or Down with
Rostopchin and Shall we be discouraged because Tchigagoff and
Kutusoff and Carrymeoffski of the Upperjnavyk Cgold Sdream Gards
oppose us I want to lie down and die What is the sense of these
barbedwire names anyhow Why when I was told that Barclay de
Tolly had abandoned Vitepsk and was marching on Smolensko with a
fair chance of uniting with Tormagoff and Wittgenstein I was so
mixed that I couldnt tell whether Vitepsk was a brigadiergeneral or
a Russian summerresort Nevertheless we have arrived and I think
we can pass a comfortable winter in Moscow Is Moscow a cold place
do you know

Marshal Ney looked out of the window

No Your Majesty he said I judge from appearances that its the
hottest place in creation just now Look

Bonapartes heart sank within him He looked and saw the city in
flames

Well he cried why dont you do something What kind of
theatrical soldiers are you Ring up the fire department Ah
Fouche Fouche if you were only here now You could at least arrest
the flames

It was too late Nothing could be done and the conquering hero of
nearly twenty years now experienced the bitterness of defeat
Rushing through the blazing town he ordered a retreat and was soon
sadly wending his way back to Paris

We are afraid he murmured that that Moscow fire has cooked our
imperial goose

Then finding the progress of the army too slow and anxious to hear
the news of Paris Napoleon left his troops under the command of Ney
and pushed rapidly on travelling incognito not being desirous of
accepting such receptions and fetes in his honor as the enemy had in
store for him

I do not like to leave my army in such sore straits he said but
I must I am needed at the Tuileries The King of Rome has fallen
in love with his nurse and I understand also that there is a
conspiracy to steal the throne and sell it This must not be
Reassure the army of my love Tell them that they are as was the
army of Egypt my children and that they may play out in the snow a
little while longer but must come in before they catch cold

With these words he was off Paris as usual received him with open
arms Things had been dull during his absence and his return meant
excitement The total loss of the French in this campaign was
450000 men nearly a thousand cannon and seventyfive eagles and
standards

Its a heavy loss said the Emperor but it took a snowstorm to
do it Id rather fight bears than blizzards but the French must
not be discouraged Let them join the army The Russians have
captured three thousand and fortyeight officers whose places must be
filled If that isnt encouragement to join the army I expect to
raise next spring I dont know what is As for the eaglesyou can
get gold eagles in America for ten dollars apiece so why repine On
with the dance let joy be unconfined

It was too late however The Empire had palled Bonaparte could
have started a comic paper and still have failed to rouse Paris from
its lethargy and Paris is the heart of France Storms gathered
warclouds multiplied the nations of the earth united against him
the King of Rome began cutting his teeth and destroyed the Emperors
rest The football of fate that chance had kicked so high came down
to earth with a sickening thud and Mr Bonaparte of Corsica yielded
to the inevitable

Fouche he said sending for the exiled minister in his extremity
when I lost you I lost my leading manthe star of my enterprise
During your absence the prompters box has been empty and I dont
know what to do The world is against meeven France I see but
one thing left Do you think I could restore confidence by divorcing
MarieLouise and remarrying Josephine It strikes me that an annual
shakingup of that nature would sort of liven matters up

No said Fouche it wont do Theyve had one divorce You
mustnt repeat yourself now You forget the thing Ive always tried
to impress upon you Be New not parvenu or ingenue but plain up
and down New is what you need to be It would have been just the
same if youd thrashed Russia Theyd have forced you to go on and
conquer China then theyd have demanded a war with Japan after
which theyd have dethroned you if you didnt annex the Sandwich
Islands to the United States and then bag the whole thing for
France This is what you get for wanting to rule the French people
You cant keep quietyouve got to have a move on you constantly or
they wont have you Furthermore you mustnt make em laugh except
at the other man Youve had luck in that respect but theres no
telling how long it will continue now that you have a son Hes
beginning to say funny things and theyre generally at your expense
and one or two people hereabouts have snickered at you already

What do you mean said Napoleon with a frown What has the boy
said about me

He told the Minister of Finance the other night that now that you
were the father of a real Emperors grandson you had a valid claim
to respectability and hed bite the head off the first person who
said you hadnt said Fouche

Wellthat certainly was standing up for his daddy said the
Emperor fondly

Yeees said Fouche but its one of those double backaction
remarks that do more harm than good

Well said Bonaparte desperately let the boy say what he
pleases hes my son and he has that right The thing for us to
decide is what shall we do now

There are three things left said Fouche

And they asked the Emperor

Write Trilby abdicate or commit suicide The first is beyond you
You know enough about Paris but your style is against you As for
the second abdicationif you abdicate you may come back and the
trouble will begin all over again If you commit suicide you wont
have any more rows The French will be startled and say that its a
splendid climax and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that
some other man will try to please them with the same result

It shall be abdication said the Emperor with a sigh I dont
mind suicide but hang it Fouche if I killed myself I could not
read what the papers said about it As for writing Trilby it would
do more for royalty than for me Therefore I will go to
Fontainebleau and abdicate I will go into exile at Elba Exiles
are most interesting people and it may be that Ill have another
chance

This course was taken and on the 20th of April 1814 Bonaparte
abdicated His speech to his faithful guard was one of the most
affecting farewells in history and had much to do with the encore
which Napoleon received less than a year after Escorted by four
commissioners one from each of the great allied powers Austria
Russia England and Prussia and attended by a few attached friends
and servants Bonaparte set out from Paris The party occupied
fourteen carriages Bonaparte in the first and as they left the
capital the exEmperor leaning out of the window looked back at the
train of conveyances and sighed

What Sire You sigh cried Bertrand

Yes Bertrand yes Not for my departed glory but because I am a
living Frenchman and not a dead Irishman

And why so Sire asked Bertrand

Because my friend of the carriages There are fourteen in this
funeral Think Bertrand he moaned in a tone rendered doubly
impressive by the fact that it reminded one of Henry Irving in one of
his most mannered moments Think how I should have enjoyed this
moment had I been a dead Irishman



CHAPTER XI ELBATHE RETURNWATERLOOST HELENA
18141815



Bonapartes spirits rose as the party proceeded There were
remarkable evidences all along the line of march that his greatness
while dimmed in one sense had not diminished in others A series of
attacks upon him had been arranged much to the fallen Emperors
delight

If you want to make a fellow popular Bertrand he remarked after
one of them kick him when hes down Ill wager I am having a
better time now than Louis XVIII and after all I regard this
merely as a vacation Ill have a good rest at Elba while Louis is
pushing the button of government at Paris After a while Ill come
back and press the buttons and Louis will do the rest Theres some
honey in the old Bees yet

At Valence however the Emperor had a bitter cup to drain Meeting
Augereau there with whom he had fallen out he addressed him in his
oldtime imperial style asking him what right he had to still live
and requesting him to stand out of his light Augereau taking
advantage of the Emperors fallen estate replied in a spirited
manner calling Napoleon an exEmperor and a tin soldier as well as
applying several other epithets to his dethroned majesty which might
be printed in a French book but can have no place in this

We shall meet again retorted Bonaparte with a threatening
gesture

Not if I see you first replied Augereau If we do however it
will be under a new system of etiquette

Ill bet you a crown youll be singing a new tune inside of a year
cried the exasperated Bonaparte

Ill go you said Augereau snapping his fingers Put up your
crown

Napoleon felt keenly the stinging satire of this retort Bowing his
head with a groan he had to acknowledge that he had no crown but in
an instant he recovered

But I have a Napoleon left in my clothes he cried with a dry
laugh at his own wit Ill bet it against your income for the next
forty centuries which is giving you large odds that I shall return
and when I do Monsieur Augereau your name will be Denis

The appreciation of those about them of this sally so enraged
Augereau that he was discomfited utterly and he left Bonapartes
presence muttering words which are fortunately forgotten

Arrived at Cannes Bonaparte had his choice of vessels upon which to
make his voyage to Elba one English and one French Ill take the
English I shall not trust my life to a Bourbon ship if I know
myself Id rather go to sea in a bowl said he

Hence it was that an English vessel the Undaunted had the honor of
transporting the illustrious exile to his island dominion On the
4th of May he landed and immediately made a survey of his new
kingdom

It isnt large he observed as he made a memorandum of its
dimensions but neither is a canvasback duck I think we can make
something of it particularly as the people seem glad to see me

This was indeed the truth The Elbese were delighted to have
Bonaparte in their midst They realized that excursion steamers
which had hitherto passed them by would now come crowded from main
top to keel with persons desirous of seeing the illustrious captive
Hotel rates rose 200 per cent and on the first Sunday of his stay
on the island the receipts of the Island Museum as it was now
called were sufficient to pay its taxes to the French government
which had been in arrears for some time ten times over

I feel like an ossified man or a turtleboy said the Emperor to
Bertrand as the curious visitors gaped awestricken at the caged
lion If I only had a few pictures of myself to sell these people I
could buy up the national debt foreclose the mortgage and go back
to France as its absolute master

The popularity of Bonaparte as an attraction to outsiders so endeared
him to the hearts of his new subjects that he practically had greater
sway here than he ever had in the palmy days of the Empire The
citizens made him master of everything and Bonaparte filled the role
to the full Provided with guards and servants he surrounded
himself with all the gaud and glitter of a military despotism and
in default of continents to capture he kept his hand in trim as a
commander by the conquest of such small neighboring islands as nature
had placed within reach but it could hardly be expected that he
could long remain tranquil His eyes soon wearied of the
circumscribed limits of Elba

Its all very well to be monarch of all you survey Bertrand said
he mournfully but as for me give me some of the things that cant
be seen I might as well be that old driedup fig of a P T Olemy
over there in Egypt as Emperor of a vestpocket Empire like this
Isnt there any news from France

Yes returned Bertrand Paris is murmuring again Louis hasnt
stopped eating yet and the French think its time his dinner was
over

Ha cried Bonaparte in ecstasy I thought so Hes too much of a
revivalist to suit Paris Furthermore Im told hes brought out his
shopworn aristocracy to dazzle France again Theyre all wool and a
yard wide but you neednt think my handmade nobility is going to
efface itself just because the Montmorencies and the Rohans dont ask
it out to dine My dukes and duchesses will have something to say I
fancy and if my old laundress the Duchess of Dantzig doesnt take
the starch out of the old regime Ill be mightily mistaken

And this was the exact situation As Bonaparte said the old regime
by their hauteur so enraged the new regime that by the new year of
1815 it was seen by all except those in authority that the return of
the exile Corporal Violet as he was now called was inevitable So
it came about that on the 20th of February his pockets stuffed with
impromptu addresses to the people and the army Bonaparte eluding
those whose duty it was to watch him set sail and on the 1st of
March he reached Cannes whence he immediately marched gaining
recruits at every step to Paris

At Lyons he began to issue his impromptu addresses and they were in
his best style

People of France ran one I am refreshed and have returned to
resume business at the old stand March 21st will be bargain day
and I have on hand a select assortment of secondhand goods One
king one aristocracy much worn and slightly dogeared and a
monarchy will be disposed of at less than cost Come early and avoid
the rush A dukedom will be given away with every purchase Do not
forget the addressThe Tuileries Paris

This was signed Napoleon Emperor Its effect was instantaneous
and the appointment was faithfully kept for on the evening of March
20th the Emperor amid great enthusiasm entered the Tuileries where
he was met by all his old friends including Fouche

Fouche he said as he entered the throneroom give my card to
Louis the XVIII and ask him if his luggage is ready Make out his
bill and when he has paid it tell him that I have ordered the 610
train to start at 948 He can easily catch it

He has already departed Sire returned Fouche He had an
imperative engagement in the Netherlands In his haste he left his
crown hanging on the hatrack in the hall

Well send it to him replied Bonaparte I dont want HIS crown
I want my own It shall never be said that I robbed a poor fellow
out of work of his hat

Settled once more upon his imperial throne the main question which
had previously agitated the Emperor and his advisers and
particularly his stagemanager Fouche whom he now restored to his
old office came up once more What next and it was harder to
answer than ever for Bonapartes mind was no longer alert He was
listless and given to delay and worst of all invariably sleepy
It was evident that Elba had not proved as restful as had been hoped

You should not have returned said Fouche firmly America was
the field for you Thats where all great actors go sooner or later
and they make fortunes A season in New York would have made you a
new man As it is you are an old man It seems to me that if an
Irishman can leave Queenstown with nothing but his brogue and the
clothes on his back and become an alderman of New York or Chicago
inside of two years you with all the advertising youve had ought to
be able to get into Congress anyhowyouve got money enough for the
Senate

But they are not my children those Americans remonstrated
Napoleon rubbing his eyes sleepily

Well France isnt the family affair it once was either retorted
Fouche and youll find it out before long However weve got to
do the best we can Swear off your old ways and come out as a man of
Peace Flatter the English and by all means dont ask your mother
inlaw Francis Joseph to send back the only woman you ever loved
Hes got her in Vienna and hes going to keep her if he has to put
her in a safedeposit vault

It would have been well for Napoleon had he heeded this advice but
as he walked about the Tuileries alone and listened in vain for the
King of Romes demands for more candy and failed to see that
interesting infant sliding down the banisters and loading his toy
cannons with his mothers facepowder he was oppressed by a sense of
loneliness and could not resist the temptation to send for them

This will be the last chip Ill put on my shoulder Fouche he
pleaded

Very well returned Fouche Put it there but I warn you This
last chip will break the Empires back

The demand was made upon Austria and as Fouche had said the answer
was a most decided refusal and the result was war Again the other
powers allied against Napoleon The forces of the enemy were placed
under Wellington Bonaparte led his own in person buying a new
uniform for the purpose We can handle them easily enough said
he if I can only keep awake My situation at present reminds me so
much of the old Bromide days that I fall asleep without knowing it by
a mere association of ideas Still well whip em out of their
boots

What boots demanded Fouche

Their Wellingtons and their Bluchers retorted the Emperor thereby
showing that sleepy as he was he had not lost his oldtime ability
at repartee

For once he was overconfident He fought desperately and
triumphantly for three or four days but the fates held Waterloo in
store Routing the enemy at Ligny and Quatre Bras he pushed on to
where Wellington stood in Belgium where on the 18th of June was
fought the greatest of his battles

Now for the transformation scene said Bonaparte on the eve of the
battle If the weather is good well make these foreigners wish
they had worn runningshoes instead of Wellingtons

But the weather was not clear It was excessively wet and by
nightfall Bonaparte realized that all was over His troops were in
fine condition but the rain seemed to have put out the fires of the
Commanders genius As the Imperial Guard marched before him in
review the Emperor gazed upon them fondly

Theyre like a picture he cried enthusiastically Just see that
line

Yes returned Ney Very like a picture they remind me in a way
of a comic paper print but that is more suitable for framing than
for fighting

The Emperor making no response Ney looked up and observed that his
Majesty had fallen asleep That settles it he sighed Today is
the Waterloo of Napoleon Bonaparte When a man sleeps at a moment
like this his friends would better prepare for a wake

And Ney was right Waterloo was the Waterloo of Napoleon Bonaparte
The opposing armies met in conflict and as the world knows the
star of the great soldier was obscured forever and France was
conquered Ruined in his fortunes Bonaparte at once returned to
Paris

Is there a steamer for New York tonight Fouche he asked as
completely worn out he threw himself upon his throne and let his
chin hang dejectedly over his collar

No Sire returned Fouche with an illconcealed chuckle There
is not Youve missed your chance by two days Then isnt another
boat for ten days

Then I am lost sobbed Napoleon

Yes Sire you are returned Fouche Shall I offer a reward to
anybody who will find you and return you in good order

No replied the Emperor I will give myself up

Wise man said Fouche unsympathetically Youre such a
confounded riddle that I wonder you didnt do it long ago

Ah Fouche sighed the Emperor taking his crown out of his
wardrobe and crushing it in his hands until the diamonds fell out
upon the floor this shows the futility of making war without
preparing for it by study When I was a young man I was a student
I knew the pages of history by heart and I learned my lessons well
While I was the student I was invincible In mimic as in real war I
was the conqueror Everything I undertook came about as I had willed
because I was the master of factsI dealt in facts and I made no
mistakes Today I am a conquered man and all because I have
neglected to continue the study of the history of my peopleof my
adopted native land

Humph retorted Fouche I dont see how that would have helped
matters any All the history in creation could not have won the
battle of Waterloo for you

Fool that you are cried Napoleon desperately rising Cant you
see Anybody who knows anything about the history of France knows
that the battle of Waterloo resulted fatally for me Had I known
that do you suppose Id have gone there Not I Id have gone
fishing in the South of France instead and this would not have
happened Leave me I wish to be alone

Left to his own reflections Bonaparte paced his room for hours
Then tapping his bell he summoned one of his faithful adherents

Monsieur le B he said as the attendant entered you have heard
the news

Yes Sire sobbed Le B

Do I not carry myself well in the hour of defeat

You do Your Majesty

Am I pale Le B

Nonooh no not at all Sire

Tell me the truth Le B We must not let the enemy find us broken
when they arrive How do I look Out with it

Out of sight Sire replied Le B bending backward as far as he
could and gazing directly at the ceiling

Then bring on your invader and let us hear the worst ordered
Napoleon encouraged by Le Bs assurances

A few days later Bonaparte having nothing else to do once more
abdicated and threw himself upon the generosity of the English
people

I was only fooling anyhow he said with a sad smile If you
hadnt sent me to Elba I wouldnt have come back As for the
fighting you all said I was outside of the pale of civilization and
I had to fight I didnt care much about getting back into the pail
but I really objected to having it said that I was in the tureen

This jest completely won the hearts of the English who were used to
just such humor who loved it and who many years later showed that
love by the establishment of a comic journal as an asylum for bon
mots similarly afflicted The result was not death but a new
Empire the Island of St Helena

This said Wellington will serve to make his jokes more far
fetched than ever so that by sending him there we shall not only be
gracious to a fallen foe but add to the gayety of our nation



CHAPTER XII 181518211895



It is with St Helena that all biographies of Napoleon Bonaparte
hitherto published have ended and perhaps it is just as well that
these entertaining works prepared by purely finite minds should end
there It is well for an historian not to tell more than he knows a
principle which has guided our pen from the inception of this work to
this point and which must continue to the bitter end We shall be
relentless and truthful to the last even though in so doing we are
compelled to overthrow all historical precedent

Bonaparte arrived at St Helena in October 1815 He had embarked
every one supposed with the impression that he was going to America
and those about him fearing a passionate outbreak when he learned
the truth tried for a time to convince him that he had taken the
wrong steamer then when they found that he could not be deceived in
this way they made allusions to the steeringgear having got out of
order but the exEmperor merely smiled

You cannot fool me he said I know whither I am drifting I
went to a clairvoyant before leaving Paris who cast a few dozen
horoscopes for me and they all ended at St Helena It is
inevitable I must go there and all these fairy tales about wrong
steamers and broken rudders and so on are useless I submit I
could return if I wished but I do not wish to return By a mere
speech to these sailors I could place myself in command of this ship
today turn her about and proclaim myself Emperor of the Seas but I
dont want to I prefer dry land and peace to a coup de tar and the
throne of Neptune

All of which shows that the great warrior was weary

Then followed a dreary exile of uneventful years in which the ex
Emperor conducted paper campaigns of great fierceness against the
English government which with unprecedented parsimony allowed him no
more than 60000 a year and house rent

The idea of limiting me to five thousand dollars a month he
remarked savagely to Sir Hudson Lowe Its positively low

It strikes me as positively high retorted the governor You know
well enough that you couldnt spend ten dollars a week in this place
if you put your whole mind on it if you hadnt insisted on having
French waiters in your diningroom whom you have to tip every time
they bring you anything

Humph said Bonaparte That isnt any argument Im a man used
to handling large sums It isnt that I want to spend money its
that I want to have it about me in case of emergency However I
know well enough why they keep my allowance down to 60000

Why is it asked Sir Hudson

They know that you cant be bought for 60000 but they wouldnt
dare make it 60000 and one cent retorted the captive Put that
in your cigarette and smoke it Sir Harlem and hereafter call me
Emperor Thats my name Emperor N Bonaparte

And I beg that you will not call me Sir Harlem returned the
governor irritated by the Emperors manner My name is Hudson not
Harlem

Pray excuse the slip said the Emperor scornfully I knew you
were named after some American river I didnt know which However
I imagined that the Harlem was nearer your size than the Hudson
since the latter has some pretensions to grandeur Now please flow
down to the sea and lose yourself Im getting sleepy again

So in constant conflict with Sir Hudson who refused to call him by
his title and whom in consequence he refused to call by his proper
name answering such epithets as Corporal and Major with a
savagelyspoken Delaware or an ironically respectful Mohawk
Bonaparte dwelt at St Helena until the 5th of May 1821 when
historians tell us he died This is an error for upon that date
Bonaparte escaped He had fought death too many times to succumb to
him now and while the writers of history have in a sense stated the
truth when they say that he passed away in the night their readers
have gained a false impression It is the fact that Napoleon
Bonaparte like Dante and Virgil passed over the dark river Styx as
the honored leader of the rebellious forces of Hades He did pass
away in the night but he went as he went from Elba and as we shall
see with more successful results

For years the Government of Erebus had been unsatisfactory to many of
its subjects mainly on account of the arbitrary methods of the
Weather Department

We are in a perpetual broil here Caesar had said and I for one
am getting tired of it The country demands a change This
administration doesnt give us anything but dogdays

For this the Roman warrior had been arrested and kept in an oven at
the rear of the Erebian Tuileries as Apollyons Palace was called
for two centuries

The next rebel gets a gridiron and the third will be served to
Cerberus en brochette cried Apollyon

Thus matters had gone on for five or six hundred years and no one
had ventured to complain further particularly in view of Caesars
comments upon the horrid details of his incarceration published
several years after his release under the title of Two Centuries in
an Oven or Four Thousand and Six in the Shade

At the end of the eighteenth century however the aspect of affairs
had changed Apollyon had spent a great deal of his time abroad and
had failed to note how the revolution in America the Reign of Terror
in France and the subsequent wars in Europe had materially increased
the forces of the Republican Party in Hades The French arrivals
alone should have been sufficient to convince Apollyon that his
attention to domestic affairs was needed and that the
Americanization of his domain was gaining a most considerable
headway All the movement really needed was a leader but there was
none to lead

Caesars book has made us timid I dont want any of it said
Alcibiades

Ive had enough of public life said Charlemagne

Its hot enough for us as it is said all four of the Three
Musketeers

Well have to get somebody who is not aware of the possibilities of
our climate observed Frederick the Great

Try Napoleon Bonaparte suggested Louis XIV with a chuckle
feeling that here was an opportunity to do one of two things to get
even with Apollyon or in case of the failure of the rebellion to
be revenged upon Bonaparte for his treatment of the Bourbons by
securing for him the warmest reception the Kingdom of Hades could
afford

The suggestion according to documents at hand which seem to be
veracious was adopted with enthusiasm The exile was communicated
with and joy settled upon the people of Hades when word was received
that Bonaparte was on his way As we have seen on the night of the
5th of May he left St Helena and on the 10th he landed on the right
bank of the Styx A magnificent army awaited him To the Old Guard
many of whom had preceded him was accorded the position of honor
and as Bonaparte stepped ashore the roof of Erebus was rent with
vivas Such a scene has never been witnessed before and may never
be witnessed again The populace flocked about him and strove to
kiss his hand some went so far as to clip off samples of his uniform
to treasure in their homes It was evident that the government must
look to itself

What is this noise asked Apollyon who had returned to his domain
only the night before

Bonaparte has arrived returned the head Imp and the people are
in revolt

Apollyon paled and summoned his ministers

Meanwhile Bonaparte had held a council of war appointing Caesar
Pompey Alcibiades and Charlemagne marshals of Hades

The first thing to be done is to capture the coalyards he said
taking in the situation at a glance Caesar let the coalyards be
your care Alcibiades will take the Three Musketeers and by night
will make a detour to the other side of the palace and open the
sluices of the vitriol reservoir which I understand run into the
Styx Pompey will surprise the stokers in the national engineroom
with a force of ten thousand put out the fires and await further
orders Charlemagne will accompany me with the army to the palace
where I shall demand an audience with the king

It will be seen at once that granting the success of all these
manoeuvres Apollyon could not possibly hold out As the Hollanders
had only water with which to flood their country and rout their
enemies so Apollyon had only fire with which to wither an invader or
a rebellious force The quick mind of Bonaparte took this in on the
instant He was no longer listless and sleepy for here was the
grandest opportunity of his life and he knew it

Fortune favored him In Hades fortune was a material personality
and not an abstract idea as she is with us and when she met
Bonaparte on his triumphal march along the Styx she yielded to that
fascination which even phlegmatic Englishmen could not deny that he
possessed and when at this meeting the man of the hour took her by
the hand and breathed softly into her ear that she was in very truth
the only woman he had ever loved she instinctively felt that he had
at last spoken from his heart of hearts

I believe you Bonaparte she murmured softly and I think I have
shown you in the past that I am not indifferent to you I am with
youApollyon is doomed

Thus encouraged Bonaparte followed by his constantly growing army
proceeded to the palace

Apollyon received him with dignity

I am glad to receive so distinguished a person he said

Thank you said Bonaparte but this is not a society function
Your HighnessI have come here on business so spare me your
flatteries

Apollyon turned purple with rage

Insolent he cried Consider yourself under arrest

Certainly said Bonaparte calmly Will you kindly hand me your
crown

Apollyon rose in his wrath and ordered his aides to arrest
Bonaparte and to cast him into the furnace Make it a million
degrees Farenheit he roared

I regret to inform your majesty said the chief aide that word
has just been received that the fires are out the coalyard has been
captured by the rebels and five adventurous spirits have let all the
vitriol out of the reservoir into the Styx

Summon my guards and have this man boned then raged Apollyon

It is also with regret that I have to tell you returned the aide
that the Royal Guard has gone over to the enemy having been
promised higher wages

We have Cerberus left cried Apollyon let him take this base
intruder and tear him limb from limb

Napoleon burst out into a laugh You will excuse me Your Majesty
he said But Cerberus is already fixed We poisoned two of his
heads and he is even now whining for his life with the third

Then am I undone moaned Apollyon covering his face with his
hands

You are said Bonaparte but well tie you up again in short
order Well put you on one of your own gridirons and do you to a
turn

Of course this was the end

In three days Napoleon had made himself master of the kingdom had
proclaimed the Empire with himself at its head Apollyon was treated
with consideration His life was spared but he was shorn of his
power Bonaparte sent him into exile at Paris where according to
report he still lives

Now for a new coronation said the victor Send for the pope

Not this tune cried Caesar with a laugh The popes have always
studiously avoided this place

Then said Napoleon with a smile let Fortune crown me After
all it has always been she who did itwhy not now

Hence it was that at the dawning of New Years day of 1822 Napoleon
Bonaparte opened a new and most highly successful career His power
has increased day by day until now when there is evidence that he
has the greater part of the world in his firm grasp

Some years later his beloved Bourrienne arrived

Remember Bourrienne he said as he installed his old and faithful
secretary in his new office you have always written my autographs
for me and shall still continue to do so only please note the
change It is no longer Bonaparte or Napoleon Emperor of the
French it has become Napollyon Emperor of Hades

And to Fouche when that worthy arrived he said

Fouche this is different from the old show That original Empire
of mine was ruined by just one thing I was eternally anxious to
provide for the succession and out of that grew all my troubles but
here as the little girl said about the applecore there aint a
goin to be no succession I am here to stay Meanwhile Fouche I
have an impression that you and Augureau took more pleasure out of my
misfortunes than I did wherefore I authorize you to send for
Augereau and take him swimming in the vitriol tank It will do you
both good

As for Joseph when he heard of his brothers new acquisition he
reformed at once led an irreproachable life in America whither he
had fled and when he died went to the other place
