THE PATAGONIA
by Henry James


CHAPTER I


The houses were dark in the August night and the perspective of Beacon
Street with its double chain of lamps was a foreshortened desert The
club on the hill alone from its semicylindrical front projected a glow
upon the dusky vagueness of the Common and as I passed it I heard in the
hot stillness the click of a pair of billiardballs As every one was
out of town perhaps the servants in the extravagance of their leisure
were profaning the tables The heat was insufferable and I thought with
joy of the morrow of the deck of the steamer the freshening breeze the
sense of getting out to sea I was even glad of what I had learned in
the afternoon at the office of the companythat at the eleventh hour an
old ship with a lower standard of speed had been put on in place of the
vessel in which I had taken my passage America was roasting England
might very well be stuffy and a slow passage which at that season of
the year would probably also be a fine one was a guarantee of ten or
twelve days of fresh air

I strolled down the hill without meeting a creature though I could see
through the palings of the Common that that recreative expanse was
peopled with dim forms I remembered Mrs Nettlepoints houseshe lived
in those days they are not so distant but there have been changes on
the waterside a little way beyond the spot at which the Public Garden
terminates and I reflected that like myself she would be spending the
night in Boston if it were true that as had been mentioned to me a few
days before at Mount Desert she was to embark on the morrow for
Liverpool I presently saw this appearance confirmed by a light above
her door and in two or three of her windows and I determined to ask for
her having nothing to do till bedtime I had come out simply to pass an
hour leaving my hotel to the blaze of its gas and the perspiration of
its porters but it occurred to me that my old friend might very _well_
not know of the substitution of the _Patagonia_ for the _Scandinavia_ so
that I should be doing her a service to prepare her mind Besides I
could offer to help her to look after her in the morning lone women are
grateful for support in taking ship for far countries

It came to me indeed as I stood on her doorstep that as she had a son
she might not after all be so lone yet I remembered at the same time
that Jasper Nettlepoint was not quite a young man to lean upon havingas
I at least supposeda life of his own and tastes and habits which had
long since diverted him from the maternal side If he did happen just
now to be at home my solicitude would of course seem officious for in
his many wanderingsI believed he had roamed all over the globehe
would certainly have learned how to manage None the less in fine I
was very glad to show Mrs Nettlepoint I thought of her With my long
absence I had lost sight of her but I had liked her of old she had been
a good friend to my sisters and I had in regard to her that sense which
is pleasant to those who in general have gone astray or got detached the
sense that she at least knew all about me I could trust her at any time
to tell people I was respectable Perhaps I was conscious of how little
I deserved this indulgence when it came over me that I hadnt been near
her for ages The measure of that neglect was given by my vagueness of
mind about Jasper However I really belonged nowadays to a different
generation I was more the mothers contemporary than the sons

Mrs Nettlepoint was at home I found her in her back drawingroom where
the wide windows opened to the water The room was duskyit was too hot
for lampsand she sat slowly moving her fan and looking out on the
little arm of the sea which is so pretty at night reflecting the lights
of Cambridgeport and Charlestown I supposed she was musing on the loved
ones she was to leave behind her married daughters her grandchildren
but she struck a note more specifically Bostonian as she said to me
pointing with her fan to the Back Bay I shall see nothing more charming
than that over there you know She made me very welcome but her son
had told her about the _Patagonia_ for which she was sorry as this
would mean a longer voyage She was a poor creature in any boat and
mainly confined to her cabin even in weather extravagantly termed fineas
if any weather could be fine at sea

Ah then your sons going with you I asked

Here he comes hell tell you for himself much better than I can pretend
to Jasper Nettlepoint at that moment joined us dressed in white
flannel and carrying a large fan Well my dear have you decided his
mother continued with no scant irony He hasnt yet made up his mind
and we sail at ten oclock

What does it matter when my things are put up the young man said
Theres no crowd at this moment there will be cabins to spare Im
waiting for a telegramthat will settle it I just walked up to the
club to see if it was cometheyll send it there because they suppose
this house unoccupied Not yet but I shall go back in twenty minutes

Mercy how you rush about in this temperature the poor lady exclaimed
while I reflected that it was perhaps _his_ billiardballs I had heard
ten minutes before I was sure he was fond of billiards

Rush not in the least I take it uncommon easy

Ah Im bound to say you do Mrs Nettlepoint returned with
inconsequence I guessed at a certain tension between the pair and a
want of consideration on the young mans part arising perhaps from
selfishness His mother was nervous in suspense wanting to be at rest
as to whether she should have his company on the voyage or be obliged to
struggle alone But as he stood there smiling and slowly moving his fan
he struck me somehow as a person on whom this fact wouldnt sit too
heavily He was of the type of those whom other people worry about not
of those who worry about other people Tall and strong he had a
handsome face with a round head and closecurling hair the whites of
his eyes and the enamel of his teeth under his brown moustache gleamed
vaguely in the lights of the Back Bay I made out that he was sunburnt
as if he lived much in the open air and that he looked intelligent but
also slightly brutal though not in a morose way His brutality if he
had any was bright and finished I had to tell him who I was but even
then I saw how little he placed me and that my explanations gave me in
his mind no great identity or at any rate no great importance I foresaw
that he would in intercourse make me feel sometimes very young and
sometimes very old caring himself but little which He mentioned as if
to show our companion that he might safely be left to his own devices
that he had once started from London to Bombay at three quarters of an
hours notice

Yes and it must have been pleasant for the people you were with

Oh the people I was with he returned and his tone appeared to
signify that such people would always have to come off as they could He
asked if there were no cold drinks in the house no lemonade no iced
syrups in such weather something of that sort ought always to be kept
going When his mother remarked that surely at the club they _were_ kept
going he went on Oh yes I had various things there but you know Ive
walked down the hill since One should have something at either end May
I ring and see He rang while Mrs Nettlepoint observed that with the
people they had in the house an establishment reduced naturally at such
a moment to its simplest expressionthey were burning up candleends and
there were no luxuriesshe wouldnt answer for the service The matter
ended in her leaving the room in quest of cordials with the female
domestic who had arrived in response to the bell and in whom Jaspers
appeal aroused no visible intelligence

She remained away some time and I talked with her son who was sociable
but desultory and kept moving over the place always with his fan as if
he were properly impatient Sometimes he seated himself an instant on
the windowsill and then I made him out in fact thoroughly
goodlookinga fine brown clean young athlete He failed to tell me on
what special contingency his decision depended he only alluded
familiarly to an expected telegram and I saw he was probably fond at no
time of the trouble of explanations His mothers absence was a sign
that when it might be a question of gratifying him she had grown used to
spare no pains and I fancied her rummaging in some close storeroom
among old preservepots while the dull maidservant held the candle
awry I dont know whether this same vision was in his own eyes at all
events it didnt prevent his saying suddenly as he looked at his watch
that I must excuse himhe should have to go back to the club He would
return in half an houror in less He walked away and I sat there
alone conscious on the dark dismantled simplified scene in the deep
silence that rests on American towns during the hot seasonthere was now
and then a far cry or a plash in the water and at intervals the tinkle
of the bells of the horsecars on the long bridge slow in the
suffocating nightof the strange influence halfsweet halfsad that
abides in houses uninhabited or about to become so in places muffled and
bereaved where the unheeded sofas and patient belittered tables seem
like the disconcerted dogs to whom everything is alike sinister to
recognise the eve of a journey

After a while I heard the sound of voices of steps the rustle of
dresses and I looked round supposing these things to denote the return
of Mrs Nettlepoint and her handmaiden with the refection prepared for
her son What I saw however was two other female forms visitors
apparently just admitted and now ushered into the room They were not
announcedthe servant turned her back on them and rambled off to our
hostess They advanced in a wavering tentative unintroduced waypartly
I could see because the place was dark and partly because their visit
was in its nature experimental a flight of imagination or a stretch of
confidence One of the ladies was stout and the other slim and I made
sure in a moment that one was talkative and the other reserved It was
further to be discerned that one was elderly and the other young as well
as that the fact of their unlikeness didnt prevent their being mother
and daughter Mrs Nettlepoint reappeared in a very few minutes but the
interval had sufficed to establish a communicationreally copious for
the occasionbetween the strangers and the unknown gentleman whom they
found in possession hat and stick in hand This was not my doingfor
what had I to go uponand still less was it the doing of the younger
and the more indifferent or less courageous lady She spoke but
oncewhen her companion informed me that she was going out to Europe the
next day to be married Then she protested Oh mother in a tone that
struck me in the darkness as doubly odd exciting my curiosity to see her
face

It had taken the elder woman but a moment to come to that and to various
other things after I had explained that I myself was waiting for Mrs
Nettlepoint who would doubtless soon come back

Well she wont know meI guess she hasnt ever heard much about me
the good lady said but Ive come from Mrs Allen and I guess that will
make it all right I presume you know Mrs Allen

I was unacquainted with this influential personage but I assented
vaguely to the proposition Mrs Allens emissary was goodhumoured and
familiar but rather appealing than insistent she remarked that if her
friend _had_ found time to come in the afternoonshe had so much to do
being just up for the day that she couldnt be sureit would be all
right and somehow even before she mentioned Merrimac Avenue they had
come all the way from there my imagination had associated her with that
indefinite social limbo known to the properlyconstituted Boston mind as
the South Enda nebulous region which condenses here and there into a
pretty face in which the daughters are an improvement on the mothers
and are sometimes acquainted with gentlemen more gloriously domiciled
gentlemen whose wives and sisters are in turn not acquainted with them

When at last Mrs Nettlepoint came in accompanied by candles and by a
tray laden with glasses of coloured fluid which emitted a cool tinkling
I was in a position to officiate as master of the ceremonies to
introduce Mrs Mavis and Miss Grace Mavis to represent that Mrs Allen
had recommended themnay had urged themjust to come that way
informally and without fear Mrs Allen who had been prevented only by
the pressure of occupations so characteristic of her especially when up
from Mattapoisett for a few hours desperate shopping from herself
calling in the course of the day to explain who they were and what was
the favour they had to ask of her benevolent friend Goodnatured women
understand each other even when so divided as to sit residentially above
and below the salt as who should say by which token our hostess had
quickly mastered the main facts Mrs Allens visit that morning in
Merrimac Avenue to talk of Mrs Ambers great idea the classes at the
public schools in vacation she was interested with an equal charity to
that of Mrs Maviseven in such weatherin those of the South End for
games and exercises and music to keep the poor unoccupied children out
of the streets then the revelation that it had suddenly been settled
almost from one hour to the other that Grace should sail for Liverpool
Mr Porterfield at last being ready He was taking a little holiday his
mother was with him they had come over from Paris to see some of the
celebrated old buildings in England and he had telegraphed to say that
if Grace would start right off they would just finish it up and be
married It often happened that when things had dragged on that way for
years they were all huddled up at the end Of course in such a case she
Mrs Mavis had had to fly round Her daughters passage was taken but
it seemed too dreadful she should make her journey all alone the first
time she had ever been at sea without any companion or escort _She_
couldnt goMr Mavis was too sick she hadnt even been able to get him
off to the seaside

Well Mrs Nettlepoints going in that ship Mrs Allen had said and
she had represented that nothing was simpler than to give her the girl in
charge When Mrs Mavis had replied that this was all very well but that
she didnt know the lady Mrs Allen had declared that that didnt make a
speck of difference for Mrs Nettlepoint was kind enough for anything
It was easy enough to _know_ her if that was all the trouble All Mrs
Mavis would have to do would be to go right up to her next morning when
she took her daughter to the ship she would see her there on the deck
with her party and tell her fair and square what she wanted Mrs
Nettlepoint had daughters herself and would easily understand Very
likely shed even look after Grace a little on the other side in such a
queer situation going out alone to the gentleman she was engaged to
shed just help her like a good Samaritan to turn round before she was
married Mr Porterfield seemed to think they wouldnt wait long once
she was there they would have it right over at the American consuls
Mrs Allen had said it would perhaps be better still to go and see Mrs
Nettlepoint beforehand that day to tell her what they wanted then they
wouldnt seem to spring it on her just as she was leaving She herself
Mrs Allen would call and say a word for them if she could save ten
minutes before catching her train If she hadnt come it was because she
hadnt saved her ten minutes but she had made them feel that they must
come all the same Mrs Mavis liked that better because on the ship in
the morning there would be such a confusion She didnt think her
daughter would be any troubleconscientiously she didnt It was just
to have some one to speak to her and not sally forth like a servantgirl
going to a situation

I see Im to act as a sort of bridesmaid and to give her away Mrs
Nettlepoint obligingly said Kind enough in fact for anything she
showed on this occasion that it was easy enough to know her There is
notoriously nothing less desirable than an imposed aggravation of effort
at sea but she accepted without betrayed dismay the burden of the young
ladys dependence and allowed her as Mrs Mavis said to hook herself
on She evidently had the habit of patience and her reception of her
visitors story reminded me afreshI was reminded of it whenever I
returned to my native landthat my dear compatriots are the people in
the world who most freely take mutual accommodation for granted They
have always had to help themselves and have rather magnanimously failed
to learn just where helping others is distinguishable from that In no
country are there fewer forms and more reciprocities

It was doubtless not singular that the ladies from Merrimac Avenue
shouldnt feel they were importunate what was striking was that Mrs
Nettlepoint didnt appear to suspect it However she would in any case
have thought it inhuman to show thisthough I could see that under the
surface she was amused at everything the more expressive of the pilgrims
from the South End took for granted I scarce know whether the attitude
of the younger visitor added or not to the merit of her good nature Mr
Porterfields intended took no part in the demonstration scarcely spoke
sat looking at the Back Bay and the lights on the long bridge She
declined the lemonade and the other mixtures which at Mrs Nettlepoints
request I offered her while her mother partook freely of everything and
I reflectedfor I as freely drained a glass or two in which the ice
tinkledthat Mr Jasper had better hurry back if he wished to enjoy
these luxuries

Was the effect of the young womans reserve meanwhile ungracious or was
it only natural that in her particular situation she shouldnt have a
flow of compliment at her command I noticed that Mrs Nettlepoint
looked at her often and certainly though she was undemonstrative Miss
Mavis was interesting The candlelight enabled me to see that though not
in the very first flower of her youth she was still fresh and handsome
Her eyes and hair were dark her face was pale and she held up her head
as if with its thick braids and everything else involved in it it were
an appurtenance she wasnt ashamed of If her mother was excellent and
common she was not commonnot at least flagrantly soand perhaps also
not excellent At all events she wouldnt be in appearance at least a
dreary appendage which in the case of a person hooking on was always
something gained Was it because something of a romantic or pathetic
interest usually attaches to a good creature who has been the victim of a
long engagement that this young lady made an impression on me from the
firstfavoured as I had been so quickly with this glimpse of her
history I could charge her certainly with no positive appeal she only
held her tongue and smiled and her smile corrected whatever suggestion
might have forced itself upon me that the spirit within her was deadthe
spirit of that promise of which she found herself doomed to carry out the
letter

What corrected it less I must add was an odd recollection which
gathered vividness as I listened to ita mental association evoked by
the name of Mr Porterfield Surely I had a personal impression over
smeared and confused of the gentleman who was waiting at Liverpool or
who presently would be for Mrs Nettlepoints protegee I had met him
known him some time somewhere somehow on the other side Wasnt he
studying something very hard somewhereprobably in Paristen years
before and didnt he make extraordinarily neat drawings linear and
architectural Didnt he go to a table dhote at two francs
twentyfive in the Rue Bonaparte which I then frequented and didnt he
wear spectacles and a Scotch plaid arranged in a manner which seemed to
say Ive trustworthy information that thats the way they do it in the
Highlands Wasnt he exemplary to positive irritation and very poor
poor to positive oppression so that I supposed he had no overcoat and
his tartan would be what he slept under at night Wasnt he working very
hard still and wouldnt he be in the natural course not yet satisfied
that he had found his feet or knew enough to launch out He would be a
man of long preparationsMiss Maviss white face seemed to speak to one
of that It struck me that if I had been in love with her I shouldnt
have needed to lay such a train for the closer approach Architecture
was his line and he was a pupil of the Ecole des Beaux Arts This
reminiscence grew so much more vivid with me that at the end of ten
minutes I had an odd sense of knowingby implicationa good deal about
the young lady

Even after it was settled that Mrs Nettlepoint would do everything
possible for her the other visitor sat sipping our iced liquid and
telling how low Mr Mavis had been At this period the girls silence
struck me as still more conscious partly perhaps because she deprecated
her mothers free flowshe was enough of an improvement to measure
thatand partly because she was too distressed by the idea of leaving
her infirm her perhaps dying father It wasnt indistinguishable that
they were poor and that she would take out a very small purse for her
trousseau For Mr Porterfield to make up the sum his own case would
have had moreover greatly to change If he had enriched himself by the
successful practice of his profession I had encountered no edifice he had
rearedhis reputation hadnt come to my ears

Mrs Nettlepoint notified her new friends that she was a very inactive
person at sea she was prepared to suffer to the full with Miss Mavis
but not prepared to pace the deck with her to struggle with her to
accompany her to meals To this the girl replied that she would trouble
her little she was sure she was convinced she should prove a wretched
sailor and spend the voyage on her back Her mother scoffed at this
picture prophesying perfect weather and a lovely time and I interposed
to the effect that if I might be trusted as a tame bachelor fairly sea
seasoned I should be delighted to give the new member of our party an
arm or any other countenance whenever she should require it Both the
ladies thanked me for thistaking my professions with no sort of
abatementand the elder one declared that we were evidently going to be
such a sociable group that it was too bad to have to stay at home She
asked Mrs Nettlepoint if there were any one else in our party and when
our hostess mentioned her sonthere was a chance of his embarking but
wasnt it absurd he hadnt decided yetshe returned with
extraordinary candour Oh dear I do hope hell go that would be so
lovely for Grace

Somehow the words made me think of poor Mr Porterfields tartan
especially as Jasper Nettlepoint strolled in again at that moment His
mother at once challenged him it was ten oclock had he by chance made
up his great mind Apparently he failed to hear her being in the first
place surprised at the strange ladies and then struck with the fact that
one of them wasnt strange The young man after a slight hesitation
greeted Miss Mavis with a handshake and a Oh goodevening how do you
do He didnt utter her namewhich I could see he must have forgotten
but she immediately pronounced his availing herself of the American
girls discretion to present him to her mother

Well you might have told me you knew him all this time that lady
jovially cried Then she had an equal confidence for Mrs Nettlepoint
It would have saved me a worryan acquaintance already begun

Ah my sons acquaintances our hostess murmured

Yes and my daughters too Mrs Mavis gaily echoed Mrs Allen
didnt tell us _you_ were going she continued to the young man

Shed have been clever if she had been able to Mrs Nettlepoint
sighed

Dear mother I have my telegram Jasper remarked looking at Grace
Mavis

I know you very little the girl said returning his observation

Ive danced with you at some ballfor some sufferers by something or
other

I think it was an inundation or a big fire she a little languidly
smiled But it was a long time agoand I havent seen you since

Ive been in far countriesto my loss I should have said it was a big
fire

It was at the Horticultural Hall I didnt remember your name said
Grace Mavis

Thats very unkind of you when I recall vividly that you had a pink
dress

Oh I remember that dressyour strawberry tarletan you looked lovely in
it Mrs Mavis broke out You must get another just like iton the
other side

Yes your daughter looked charming in it said Jasper Nettlepoint Then
he added to the girl Yet you mentioned my name to your mother

It came back to meseeing you here I had no idea this was your home

Well I confess it isnt much Oh there are some drinkshe
approached the tray and its glasses

Indeed there are and quite deliciousMrs Mavis largely wiped her
mouth

Wont you have another thena pink one like your daughters gown

With pleasure sir Oh do see them over Mrs Mavis continued
accepting from the young mans hand a third tumbler

My mother and that gentleman Surely they can take care of themselves
he freely pleaded

Then my daughtershe has a claim as an old friend

But his mother had by this time interposed Jasper what does your
telegram say

He paid her no heed he stood there with his glass in his hand looking
from Mrs Mavis to Miss Grace

Ah leave her to me madam Im quite competent I said to Mrs Mavis

Then the young man gave me his attention The next minute he asked of
the girl Do you mean youre going to Europe

Yes tomorrow In the same ship as your mother

Thats what weve come here for to see all about it said Mrs Mavis

My son take pity on me and tell me what light your telegram throws
Mrs Nettlepoint went on

I will dearest when Ive quenched my thirst And he slowly drained
his glass

Well I declare youre worse than Gracie Mrs Mavis commented She
was first one thing and then the otherbut only about up to three
oclock yesterday

Excuse mewont you take something Jasper inquired of Gracie who
however still declined as if to make up for her mothers copious
_consommation_ I found myself quite aware that the two ladies would do
well to take leave the question of Mrs Nettlepoints good will being so
satisfactorily settled and the meeting of the morrow at the ship so near
at hand and I went so far as to judge that their protracted stay with
their hostess visibly in a fidget gave the last proof of their want of
breeding Miss Grace after all then was not such an improvement on her
mother for she easily might have taken the initiative of departure in
spite of Mrs Maviss evident game of making her own absorption of
refreshment last as long as possible I watched the girl with increasing
interest I couldnt help asking myself a question or two about her and
even perceiving already in a dim and general way that rather marked
embarrassment or at least anxiety attended her Wasnt it complicating
that she should have needed by remaining long enough to assuage a
certain suspense to learn whether or no Jasper were going to sail
Hadnt something particular passed between them on the occasion or at the
period to which we had caught their allusion and didnt she really not
know her mother was bringing her to _his_ mothers though she apparently
had thought it well not to betray knowledge Such things were
symptomaticthough indeed one scarce knew of whaton the part of a
young lady betrothed to that curious crossbarred phantom of a Mr
Porterfield But I am bound to add that she gave me no further warrant
for wonder than was conveyed in her all tacitly and covertly encouraging
her mother to linger Somehow I had a sense that _she_ was conscious of
the indecency of this I got up myself to go but Mrs Nettlepoint
detained me after seeing that my movement wouldnt be taken as a hint
and I felt she wished me not to leave my fellow visitors on her hands
Jasper complained of the closeness of the room said that it was not a
night to sit in a roomone ought to be out in the air under the sky He
denounced the windows that overlooked the water for not opening upon a
balcony or a terrace until his mother whom he hadnt yet satisfied
about his telegram reminded him that there was a beautiful balcony in
front with room for a dozen people She assured him we would go and sit
there if it would please him

It will be nice and cool tomorrow when we steam into the great ocean
said Miss Mavis expressing with more vivacity than she had yet thrown
into any of her utterances my own thought of half an hour before Mrs
Nettlepoint replied that it would probably be freezing cold and her son
murmured that he would go and try the drawingroom balcony and report
upon it Just as he was turning away he said smiling to Miss Mavis
Wont you come with me and see if its pleasant

Oh well we had better not stay all night her mother exclaimed but
still without moving The girl moved after a moments hesitationshe
rose and accompanied Jasper to the other room I saw how her slim
tallness showed to advantage as she walked and that she looked well as
she passed with her head thrown back into the darkness of the other
part of the house There was something rather marked rather
surprisingI scarcely knew why for the act in itself was simple
enoughin her acceptance of such a plea and perhaps it was our sense of
this that held the rest of us somewhat stiffly silent as she remained
away I was waiting for Mrs Mavis to go so that I myself might go and
Mrs Nettlepoint was waiting for her to go so that I mightnt This
doubtless made the young ladys absence appear to us longer than it
really wasit was probably very brief Her mother moreover I think
had now a vague lapse from ease Jasper Nettlepoint presently returned
to the back drawingroom to serve his companion with our lucent syrup
and he took occasion to remark that it was lovely on the balcony one
really got some air the breeze being from that quarter I remembered
as he went away with his tinkling tumbler that from _my_ hand a few
minutes before Miss Mavis had not been willing to accept this innocent
offering A little later Mrs Nettlepoint said Well if its so
pleasant there we had better go ourselves So we passed to the front
and in the other room met the two young people coming in from the
balcony I was to wonder in the light of later things exactly how long
they had occupied together a couple of the set of cane chairs garnishing
the place in summer If it had been but five minutes that only made
subsequent events more curious We must go mother Miss Mavis
immediately said and a moment after with a little renewal of chatter as
to our general meeting on the ship the visitors had taken leave Jasper
went down with them to the door and as soon as they had got off Mrs
Nettlepoint quite richly exhaled her impression Ah butll she be a
boreshell be a bore of bores

Not through talking too much surely

An affectation of silence is as bad I hate that particular _pose_
its coming up very much now an imitation of the English like
everything else A girl who tries to be statuesque at seathat will act
on ones nerves

I dont know what she tries to be but she succeeds in being very
handsome

So much the better for you Ill leave her to you for I shall be shut
up I like her being placed under my care my friend cried

Shell be under Jaspers I remarked

Ah he wont go she wailedI want it too much

But I didnt see it that way I have an idea hell go

Why didnt he tell me so thenwhen he came in

He was diverted by that young womana beautiful unexpected girl sitting
there

Diverted from his mother and her fond hopehis mother trembling for
his decision

WellI pieced it togethershes an old friend older than we know
It was a meeting after a long separation

Yes such a lot of them as he does know Mrs Nettlepoint sighed

Such a lot of them

He has so many female friendsin the most varied circles

Well we can close round her then I returned for I on my side know
or used to know her young man

Her intendedshe had a light of relief for this

The very one shes going out to He cant by the way it occurred to
me be very young now

How odd it soundsher muddling after him said Mrs Nettlepoint

I was going to reply that it wasnt odd if you knew Mr Porterfield but
I reflected that that perhaps only made it odder I told my companion
briefly who he wasthat I had met him in the old Paris days when I
believed for a fleeting hour that I could learn to paint when I lived
with the _jeunesse des ecoles_ and her comment on this was simply
Well he had better have come out for her

Perhaps so She looked to me as she sat there as if she might change
her mind at the last moment

About her marriage

About sailing But she wont change now

Jasper came back and his mother instantly challenged him Well _are_
you going

Yes I shall gohe was finally at peace about it Ive got my
telegram

Oh your telegramI ventured a little to jeer

That charming girls your telegram

He gave me a look but in the dusk I couldnt make out very well what it
conveyed Then he bent over his mother kissing her My news isnt
particularly satisfactory Im going for _you_

Oh you humbug she replied But she was of course delighted




CHAPTER II


People usually spend the first hours of a voyage in squeezing themselves
into their cabins taking their little precautions either so excessive
or so inadequate wondering how they can pass so many days in such a hole
and asking idiotic questions of the stewards who appear in comparison
rare men of the world My own initiations were rapid as became an old
sailor and so it seemed were Miss Maviss for when I mounted to the
deck at the end of half an hour I found her there alone in the stern of
the ship her eyes on the dwindling continent It dwindled very fast for
so big a place I accosted her having had no conversation with her amid
the crowd of leavetakers and the muddle of farewells before we put off
we talked a little about the boat our fellowpassengers and our
prospects and then I said I think you mentioned last night a name I
knowthat of Mr Porterfield

Oh no I didnt she answered very straight while she smiled at me
through her closelydrawn veil

Then it was your mother

Very likely it was my mother And she continued to smile as if I ought
to have known the difference

I venture to allude to him because Ive an idea I used to know him I
went on

Oh I see And beyond this remark she appeared to take no interest she
left it to me to make any connexion

That is if its the same one It struck me as feeble to say nothing
more so I added My Mr Porterfield was called David

Well so is ours Ours affected me as clever

I suppose I shall see him again if hes to meet you at Liverpool I
continued

Well it will be bad if he doesnt

It was too soon for me to have the idea that it would be bad if he did
that only came later So I remarked that not having seen him for so
many years it was very possible I shouldnt know him

Well Ive not seen him for a considerable time but I expect I shall
know him all the same

Oh with you its different I returned with harmlessly bright
significance Hasnt he been back since those days

I dont know she sturdily professed what days you mean

When I knew him in Parisages ago He was a pupil of the Ecole des
Beaux Arts He was studying architecture

Well hes studying it still said Grace Mavis

Hasnt he learned it yet

I dont know what he has learned I shall see Then she added for the
benefit of my perhaps undue levity Architectures very difficult and
hes tremendously thorough

Oh yes I remember that He was an admirable worker But he must have
become quite a foreigner if its so many years since he has been at
home

She seemed to regard this proposition at first as complicated but she
did what she could for me Oh hes not changeable If he were
changeable

Then however she paused I daresay she had been going to observe that
if he were changeable he would long ago have given her up After an
instant she went on He wouldnt have stuck so to his profession You
cant make much by it

I sought to attenuate her rather odd maidenly grimness It depends on
what you call much

It doesnt make you rich

Oh of course youve got to practise itand to practise it long

Yesso Mr Porterfield says

Something in the way she uttered these words made me laughthey were so
calm an implication that the gentleman in question didnt live up to his
principles But I checked myself asking her if she expected to remain
in Europe longto what one might call settle

Well it will be a good while if it takes me as long to come back as it
has taken me to go out

And I think your mother said last night that it was your first visit

Miss Mavis in her deliberate way met my eyes Didnt mother talk

It was all very interesting

She continued to look at me You dont think that she then simply
stated

What have I to gain then by saying it

Oh men have always something to gain

You make me in that case feel a terrible failure I hope at any rate
that it gives you pleasure I went on the idea of seeing foreign
lands

MercyI should think so

This was almost genial and it cheered me proportionately Its a pity
our ships not one of the fast ones if youre impatient

She was silent a little after which she brought out Oh I guess itll be
fast enough

That evening I went in to see Mrs Nettlepoint and sat on her seatrunk
which was pulled out from under the berth to accommodate me It was nine
oclock but not quite dark as our northward course had already taken us
into the latitude of the longer days She had made her nest admirably
and now rested from her labours she lay upon her sofa in a dressinggown
and a cap that became her It was her regular practice to spend the
voyage in her cabin which smelt positively goodsuch was the refinement
of her art and she had a secret peculiar to herself for keeping her port
open without shipping seas She hated what she called the mess of the
ship and the idea if she should go above of meeting stewards with
plates of supererogatory food She professed to be content with her
situationwe promised to lend each other books and I assured her
familiarly that I should be in and out of her room a dozen times a
daypitying me for having to mingle in society She judged this a
limited privilege for on the deck before we left the wharf she had taken
a view of our fellowpassengers

Oh Im an inveterate almost a professional observer I replied and
with that vice Im as well occupied as an old woman in the sun with her
knitting It makes me in any situation just inordinately and
submissively _see_ things I shall see them even here and shall come
down very often and tell you about them Youre not interested today
but you will be tomorrow for a ships a great school of gossip You
wont believe the number of researches and problems youll be engaged in
by the middle of the voyage

I Never in the worldlying here with my nose in a book and not
caring a straw

Youll participate at second hand Youll see through my eyes hang
upon my lips take sides feel passions all sorts of sympathies and
indignations Ive an idea I further developed that your young
ladys the person on board who will interest me most

Mine indeed She hasnt been near me since we left the dock

There you areyou do feel she owes you something Well I added
shes very curious

Youve such coldblooded terms Mrs Nettlepoint wailed Elle ne sait
pas se conduire she ought to have come to ask about me

Yes since youre under her care I laughed As for her not knowing
how to behavewell thats exactly what we shall see

You will but not I I wash my hands of her

Dont say thatdont say that

Mrs Nettlepoint looked at me a moment Why do you speak so solemnly

In return I considered her Ill tell you before we land And have you
seen much of your son

Oh yes he has come in several times He seems very much pleased He
has got a cabin to himself

Thats great luck I said but Ive an idea hes always in luck I
was sure I should have to offer him the second berth in my room

And you wouldnt have enjoyed that because you dont like him she
took upon herself to say

What put that into your head

It isnt in my headits in my heart my _coeur de mere_ We guess
those things You think hes selfish I could see it last night

Dear lady I contrived promptly enough to reply Ive no general ideas
about him at all Hes just one of the phenomena I am going to observe
He seems to me a very fine young man However I added since youve
mentioned last night Ill admit that I thought he rather tantalised you
He played with your suspense

Why he came at the last just to please me said Mrs Nettlepoint

I was silent a little Are you sure it was for your sake

Ah perhaps it was for yours

I bore up however against this thrust characteristic of perfidious
woman when you presume to side with her against a fond tormentor When
he went out on the balcony with that girl I found assurance to suggest
perhaps she asked him to come for _hers_

Perhaps she did But why should he do everything she asks himsuch as
she is

I dont know yet but perhaps I shall know later Not that hell tell
mefor hell never tell me anything hes not I consistently opined
one of those who tell

If she didnt ask him what you say is a great wrong to her said Mrs
Nettlepoint

Yes if she didnt But you say that to protect Jaspernot to protect
her I smiled

You _are_ coldbloodedits uncanny my friend exclaimed

Ah this is nothing yet Wait a whileyoull see At sea in general
Im awfulI exceed the limits If Ive outraged her in thought Ill
jump overboard There are ways of askinga man doesnt need to tell a
woman thatwithout the crude words

I dont know what you imagine between them said Mrs Nettlepoint

Well nothing I allowed but what was visible on the surface It
transpired as the newspapers say that they were old friends

He met her at some promiscuous partyI asked him about it afterwards
Shes not a personmy hostess was confidentwhom he could ever think
of seriously

Thats exactly what I believe

You dont observeyou knowyou imagine Mrs Nettlepoint continued to
argue How do you reconcile her laying a trap for Jasper with her going
out to Liverpool on an errand of love

Oh I wasnt to be caught that way I dont for an instant suppose she
laid a trap I believe she acted on the impulse of the moment Shes
going out to Liverpool on an errand of marriage thats not necessarily
the same thing as an errand of love especially for one who happens to
have had a personal impression of the gentleman shes engaged to

Well there are certain decencies which in such a situation the most
abandoned of her sex would still observe You apparently judge her
capableon no evidenceof violating them

Ah you dont understand the shades of things I returned Decencies
and violations dear ladytheres no need for such heavy artillery I
can perfectly imagine that without the least immodesty she should have
said to Jasper on the balcony in fact if not in words Im in dreadful
spirits but if you come I shall feel better and that will be pleasant
for you too

And why is she in dreadful spirits

She isnt I replied laughing

My poor friend wondered What then is she doing

Shes walking with your son

Mrs Nettlepoint for a moment said nothing then she treated me to
another inconsequence Ah shes horrid

No shes charming I protested

You mean shes curious

Well for me its the same thing

This led my friend of course to declare once more that I was
coldblooded On the afternoon of the morrow we had another talk and
she told me that in the morning Miss Mavis had paid her a long visit She
knew nothing poor creature about anything but her intentions were good
and she was evidently in her own eyes conscientious and decorous And
Mrs Nettlepoint concluded these remarks with the sigh Unfortunate
person

You think shes a good deal to be pitied then

Well her story sounds drearyshe told me a good deal of it She fell
to talking little by little and went from one thing to another Shes in
that situation when a girl _must_ open herselfto some woman

Hasnt she got Jasper I asked

He isnt a woman You strike me as jealous of him my companion added

I daresay _he_ thinks soor will before the end Ah noah no And I
asked Mrs Nettlepoint if our young lady struck her as very grossly a
flirt She gave me no answer but went on to remark that she found it
odd and interesting to see the way a girl like Grace Mavis resembled the
girls of the kind she herself knew better the girls of society at the
same time that she differed from them and the way the differences and
resemblances were so mixed up that on certain questions you couldnt tell
where youd find her Youd think shed feel as you did because you had
found her feeling so and then suddenly in regard to some other
matterwhich was yet quite the sameshed be utterly wanting Mrs
Nettlepoint proceeded to observeto such idle speculations does the
vacancy of seahours give encouragementthat she wondered whether it
were better to be an ordinary girl very well brought up or an
extraordinary girl not brought up at all

Oh I go in for the extraordinary girl under all circumstances

Its true that if youre _very_ well brought up youre not you cant
be ordinary said Mrs Nettlepoint smelling her strong salts Youre
a lady at any rate

And Miss Mavis is fifty miles outis that what you mean

Wellyouve seen her mother

Yes but I think your contention would be that among such people the
mother doesnt count

Precisely and thats bad

I see what you mean But isnt it rather hard If your mother doesnt
know anything its better you should be independent of her and yet if
you are that constitutes a bad note I added that Mrs Mavis had
appeared to count sufficiently two nights before She had said and done
everything she wanted while the girl sat silent and respectful Graces
attitude so far as her parent was concerned had been eminently decent

Yes but she squirmed for her said Mrs Nettlepoint

Ah if you know it I may confess she has told me as much

My friend stared Told _you_ Theres one of the things they do

Well it was only a word Wont you let me know whether you do think
her a flirt

Try her yourselfthats better than asking another woman especially as
you pretend to study folk

Oh your judgement wouldnt probably at all determine mine Its as
bearing on _you_ I ask it Which however demanded explanation so
that I was duly frank confessing myself curious as to how far maternal
immorality would go

It made her at first but repeat my words Maternal immorality

You desire your son to have every possible distraction on his voyage
and if you can make up your mind in the sense I refer to that will make
it all right Hell have no responsibility

Heavens how you analyse she cried I havent in the least your
passion for making up my mind

Then if you chance it I returned youll be more immoral still

Your reasonings strange said Mrs Nettlepoint when it was you who
tried to put into my head yesterday that she had asked him to come

Yes but in good faith

What do you mean in such a case by that

Why as girls of that sort do Their allowance and measure in such
matters I expounded is much larger than that of young persons who
have been as you say _very_ well brought up and yet Im not sure that
on the whole I dont think them thereby the more innocent Miss Mavis is
engaged and shes to be married next week but its an old old story
and theres no more romance in it than if she were going to be
photographed So her usual life proceeds and her usual life
consistsand that of _ces demoiselles_ in generalin having plenty of
gentlemens society Having it I mean without having any harm from it

Mrs Nettlepoint had given me due attention Well if theres no harm
from it what are you talking about and why am I immoral

I hesitated laughing I retractyoure sane and clear Im sure she
thinks there wont be any harm I added Thats the great point

The great point

To be settled I mean

Mercy were not trying them cried my friend How can _we_ settle
it

I mean of course in our minds There will be nothing more interesting
these next ten days for our minds to exercise themselves upon

Then theyll get terribly tired of it said Mrs Nettlepoint

No nobecause the interest will increase and the plot will thicken It
simply cant _not_ I insisted She looked at me as if she thought me
more than Mephistophelean and I went back to something she had lately
mentioned So she told you everything in her life was dreary

Not everything but most things And she didnt tell me so much as I
guessed it Shell tell me more the next time Shell behave properly
now about coming in to see me I told her she ought to

Im glad of that I said Keep her with you as much as possible

I dont follow you closely Mrs Nettlepoint replied but so far as I
do I dont think your remarks in the best taste

Well Im too excited I lose my head in these sports I had to
recognisecoldblooded as you think me Doesnt she like Mr
Porterfield

Yes thats the worst of it

I kept making her stare The worst of it

Hes so goodtheres no fault to be found with him Otherwise shed
have thrown it all up It has dragged on since she was eighteen she
became engaged to him before he went abroad to study It was one of
those very young and perfectly needless blunders that parents in America
might make so much less possible than they do The thing is to insist on
ones daughter waiting on the engagements being long and then after
youve got that started to take it on every occasion as little seriously
as possibleto make it die out You can easily tire it to death Mrs
Nettlepoint competently stated However she concluded Mr
Porterfield has taken this one seriously for some years He has done his
part to keep it alive She says he adores her

His part Surely his part would have been to marry her by this time

He has really no money My friend was even more confidently able to
report it than I had been

He ought to have got some in seven years I audibly reflected

So I think she thinks There are some sorts of helplessness that are
contemptible However a small difference has taken place Thats why
he wont wait any longer His mother has come out she has somethinga
littleand shes able to assist him Shell live with them and bear
some of the expenses and after her death the son will have what there
is

How old is she I cynically asked

I havent the least idea But it doesnt on his part sound very
heroicor very inspiring for our friend here He hasnt been to America
since he first went out

Thats an odd way of adoring her I observed

I made that objection mentally but I didnt express it to her She met
it indeed a little by telling me that he had had other chances to marry

That surprises me I remarked But did she say I asked that _she_
had had

No and thats one of the things I thought nice in her for she must
have had She didnt try to make out that he had spoiled her life She
has three other sisters and theres very little money at home She has
tried to make money she has written little things and painted little
thingsand dreadful little things they must have been too bad to think
of Her father has had a long illness and has lost his placehe was in
receipt of a salary in connexion with some waterworksand one of her
sisters has lately become a widow with children and without means And
so as in fact she never has married any one else whatever opportunities
she may have encountered she appears to have just made up her mind to go
out to Mr Porterfield as the least of her evils But it isnt very
amusing

Well I judged after all that only makes her doing it the more
honourable Shell go through with it whatever it costs rather than
disappoint him after he has waited so long Its true I continued
that when a woman acts from a sense of honour

Well when she does said Mrs Nettlepoint for I hung back
perceptibly

Its often so extravagant and unnatural a proceeding as to entail heavy
costs on some one

Youre very impertinent We all have to pay for each other all the
while and for each others virtues as well as vices

Thats precisely why I shall be sorry for Mr Porterfield when she steps
off the ship with her little bill I mean with her teeth clenched

Her teeth are not in the least clenched Shes quite at her ease
nowMrs Nettlepoint could answer for that

Well we must try and keep her so I said

You must take care that Jasper neglects nothing I scarce know what
reflexions this innocent pleasantry of mine provoked on the good ladys
part the upshot of them at all events was to make her say Well I
never asked her to come Im very glad of that Its all their own
doing

Their ownyou mean Jaspers and hers

No indeed I mean her mothers and Mrs Allens the girls too of
course They put themselves on us by main force

Oh yes I can testify to that Therefore Im glad too We should have
missed it I think

How seriously you take it Mrs Nettlepoint amusedly cried

Ah wait a few daysand I got up to leave her




CHAPTER III


The _Patagonia_ was slow but spacious and comfortable and there was a
motherly decency in her long nursing rock and her rustling oldfashioned
gait the multitudinous swish in her wake as of a thousand proper
petticoats It was as if she wished not to present herself in port with
the splashed eagerness of a young creature We werent numerous enough
quite to elbow each other and yet werent too few to supportwith that
familiarity and relief which figures and objects acquire on the great
bare field of the ocean and under the great bright glass of the sky I
had never liked the sea so much before indeed I had never liked it at
all but now I had a revelation of how in a midsummer mood it could
please It was darkly and magnificently blue and imperturbably
quietsave for the great regular swell of its heartbeats the pulse of
its life and there grew to be something so agreeable in the sense of
floating there in infinite isolation and leisure that it was a positive
godsend the _Patagonia_ was no racer One had never thought of the sea
as the great place of safety but now it came over one that theres no
place so safe from the land When it doesnt confer trouble it takes
trouble awaytakes away letters and telegrams and newspapers and visits
and duties and efforts all the complications all the superfluities and
superstitions that we have stuffed into our terrene life The simple
absence of the post when the particular conditions enable you to enjoy
the great fact by which its produced becomes in itself a positive
bliss and the clean boards of the deck turn to the stage of a play that
amuses the personal drama of the voyage the movement and interaction
in the strong sealight of figures that end by representing
somethingsomething moreover of which the interest is never even in its
keenness too great to suffer you to slumber I at any rate dozed to
excess stretched on my rug with a French novel and when I opened my
eyes I generally saw Jasper Nettlepoint pass with the young woman
confided to his mothers care on his arm Somehow at these moments
between sleeping and waking I inconsequently felt that my French novel
had set them in motion Perhaps this was because I had fallen into the
trick at the start of regarding Grace Mavis almost as a married woman
which as every one knows is the necessary status of the heroine of such
a work Every revolution of our engine at any rate would contribute to
the effect of making her one

In the saloon at meals my neighbour on the right was a certain little
Mrs Peck a very short and very round person whose head was enveloped in
a cloud a cloud of dirty white wool and who promptly let me know that
she was going to Europe for the education of her children I had already
perceivedan hour after we left the dockthat some energetic measure
was required in their interest but as we were not in Europe yet the
redemption of the four little Pecks was stayed Enjoying untrammelled
leisure they swarmed about the ship as if they had been pirates boarding
her and their mother was as powerless to check their licence as if she
had been gagged and stowed away in the hold They were especially to be
trusted to dive between the legs of the stewards when these attendants
arrived with bowls of soup for the languid ladies Their mother was too
busy counting over to her fellowpassengers all the years Miss Mavis had
been engaged In the blank of our common detachment things that were
nobodys business very soon became everybodys and this was just one of
those facts that are propagated with mysterious and ridiculous speed The
whisper that carries them is very small in the great scale of things of
air and space and progress but its also very safe for theres no
compression no soundingboard to make speakers responsible And then
repetition at sea is somehow not repetition monotony is in the air the
mind is flat and everything recursthe bells the meals the stewards
faces the romp of children the walk the clothes the very shoes and
buttons of passengers taking their exercise These things finally grow
at once so circumstantial and so arid that in comparison lights on the
personal history of ones companions become a substitute for the friendly
flicker of the lost fireside

Jasper Nettlepoint sat on my left hand when he was not upstairs seeing
that Miss Mavis had her repast comfortably on deck His mothers place
would have been next mine had she shown herself and then that of the
young lady under her care These companions in other words would have
been between us Jasper marking the limit of the party in that quarter
Miss Mavis was present at luncheon the first day but dinner passed
without her coming in and when it was half over Jasper remarked that he
would go up and look after her

Isnt that young lady comingthe one who was here to lunch Mrs Peck
asked of me as he left the saloon

Apparently not My friend tells me she doesnt like the saloon

You dont mean to say shes sick do you

Oh no not in this weather But she likes to be above

And is that gentleman gone up to her

Yes shes under his mothers care

And is his mother up there too asked Mrs Peck whose processes were
homely and direct

No she remains in her cabin People have different tastes Perhaps
thats one reason why Miss Mavis doesnt come to table I addedher
chaperon not being able to accompany her

Her chaperon my fellow passenger echoed

Mrs Nettlepointthe lady under whose protection she happens to be

Protection Mrs Peck stared at me a moment moving some valued morsel
in her mouth then she exclaimed familiarly Pshaw I was struck with
this and was on the point of asking her what she meant by it when she
continued Aint we going to see Mrs Nettlepoint

Im afraid not She vows she wont stir from her sofa

Pshaw said Mrs Peck again Thats quite a disappointment

Do you know her then

No but I know all about her Then my companion added You dont mean
to say shes any real relation

Do you mean to me

No to Grace Mavis

None at all Theyre very new friends as I happen to know Then
youre acquainted with our young lady I hadnt noticed the passage of
any recognition between them at luncheon

Is she your young lady too asked Mrs Peck with high significance

Ah when people are in the same boatliterallythey belong a little to
each other

Thats so said Mrs Peck I dont know Miss Mavis but I know all
about herI live opposite to her on Merrimac Avenue I dont know
whether you know that part

Oh yesits very beautiful

The consequence of this remark was another Pshaw But Mrs Peck went
on When youve lived opposite to people like that for a long time you
feel as if you had some rights in themtit for tat But she didnt take
it up today she didnt speak to me She knows who I am as well as she
knows her own mother

You had better speak to her firstshes constitutionally shy I
remarked

Shy Shes constitutionally tough Why shes thirty years old cried
my neighbour I suppose you know where shes going

Oh yeswe all take an interest in that

That young man I suppose particularly And then as I feigned a
vagueness The handsome one who sits _there_ Didnt you tell me hes
Mrs Nettlepoints son

Oh yeshe acts as her deputy No doubt he does all he can to carry out
her function

Mrs Peck briefly brooded I had spoken jocosely but she took it with a
serious face Well she might let him eat his dinner in peace she
presently put forth

Oh hell come back I said glancing at his place The repast
continued and when it was finished I screwed my chair round to leave the
table Mrs Peck performed the same movement and we quitted the saloon
together Outside of it was the usual vestibule with several seats
from which you could descend to the lower cabins or mount to the
promenadedeck Mrs Peck appeared to hesitate as to her course and then
solved the problem by going neither way She dropped on one of the
benches and looked up at me

I thought you said hed come back

Young Nettlepoint Yes I see he didnt Miss Mavis then has given him
half her dinner

Its very kind of her She has been engaged half her life

Yes but that will soon be over

So I supposeas quick as ever we land Every one knows it on Merrimac
Avenue Mrs Peck pursued Every one there takes a great interest in
it

Ah of coursea girl like that has many friends

But my informant discriminated I mean even people who dont know her

I see I went on shes so handsome that she attracts attentionpeople
enter into her affairs

Mrs Peck spoke as from the commanding centre of these She _used_ to
be pretty but I cant say I think shes anything remarkable today
Anyhow if she attracts attention she ought to be all the more careful
what she does You had better tell her that

Oh its none of my business I easily made out leaving the terrible
little woman and going above This profession I grant was not
perfectly attuned to my real idea or rather my real idea was not quite
in harmony with my profession The very first thing I did on reaching
the deck was to notice that Miss Mavis was pacing it on Jasper
Nettlepoints arm and that whatever beauty she might have lost according
to Mrs Pecks insinuation she still kept enough to make ones eyes
follow her She had put on a crimson hood which was very becoming to
her and which she wore for the rest of the voyage She walked very well
with long steps and I remember that at this moment the sea had a gentle
evening swell which made the great ship dip slowly rhythmically giving
a movement that was graceful to graceful pedestrians and a more awkward
one to the awkward It was the loveliest hour of a fine day the clear
early evening with the glow of the sunset in the air and a purple colour
on the deep It was always present to me that so the waters ploughed by
the Homeric heroes must have looked I became conscious on this
particular occasion moreover that Grace Mavis would for the rest of the
voyage be the most visible thing in ones range the figure that would
count most in the composition of groups She couldnt help it poor
girl nature had made her conspicuousimportant as the painters say
She paid for it by the corresponding exposure the danger that people
would as I had said to Mrs Peck enter into her affairs

Jasper Nettlepoint went down at certain times to see his mother and I
watched for one of these occasionson the third day outand took
advantage of it to go and sit by Miss Mavis She wore a light blue veil
drawn tightly over her face so that if the smile with which she greeted
me rather lacked intensity I could account for it partly by that

Well were getting onwere getting on I said cheerfully looking at
the friendly twinkling sea

Are we going very fast

Not fast but steadily _Ohne Hast ohne Rast_do you know German

Well Ive studied itsome

It will be useful to you over there when you travel

Well yes if we do But I dont suppose we shall much Mr Nettlepoint
says we ought my young woman added in a moment

Ah of course _he_ thinks so He has been all over the world

Yes he has described some of the places They must be wonderful I
didnt know I should like it so much

But it isnt Europe yet I laughed

Well she didnt care if it wasnt I mean going on this way I could
go on for everfor ever and ever

Ah you know its not always like this I hastened to mention

Well its better than Boston

It isnt so good as Paris I still more portentously noted

Oh I know all about Paris Theres no freshness in that I feel as if
I had been there all the time

You mean youve heard so much of it

Oh yes nothing else for ten years

I had come to talk with Miss Mavis because she was attractive but I had
been rather conscious of the absence of a good topic not feeling at
liberty to revert to Mr Porterfield She hadnt encouraged me when I
spoke to her as we were leaving Boston to go on with the history of my
acquaintance with this gentleman and yet now unexpectedly she appeared
to implyit was doubtless one of the disparities mentioned by Mrs
Nettlepointthat he might be glanced at without indelicacy

I seeyou mean by letters I remarked

We wont live in a good part I know enough to know that she went on

Well it isnt as if there were any very bad ones I answered
reassuringly

Why Mr Nettlepoint says its regular mean

And to what does he apply that expression

She eyed me a moment as if I were elegant at her expense but she
answered my question Up there in the Batignolles I seem to make out
its worse than Merrimac Avenue

Worsein what way

Why even less where the nice people live

He oughtnt to say that I returned And I ventured to back it up
Dont you call Mr Porterfield a nice person

Oh it doesnt make any difference She watched me again a moment
through her veil the texture of which gave her look a suffused
prettiness Do you know him very little she asked

Mr Porterfield

No Mr Nettlepoint

Ah very little Hes very considerably my junior you see

She had a fresh pause as if almost again for my elegance but she went
on Hes younger than me too I dont know what effect of the comic
there could have been in it but the turn was unexpected and it made me
laugh Neither do I know whether Miss Mavis took offence at my
sensibility on this head though I remember thinking at the moment with
compunction that it had brought a flush to her cheek At all events she
got up gathering her shawl and her books into her arm Im going
downIm tired

Tired of me Im afraid

No not yet

Im like you I confessed I should like it to go on and on

She had begun to walk along the deck to the companionway and I went with
her Well I guess _I_ wouldnt after all

I had taken her shawl from her to carry it but at the top of the steps
that led down to the cabins I had to give it back Your mother would be
glad if she could know I observed as we parted

But she was proof against my graces If she could know what

How well youre getting on I refused to be discouraged And that
good Mrs Allen

Oh mother mother She made me come she pushed me off And almost as
if not to say more she went quickly below

I paid Mrs Nettlepoint a morning visit after luncheon and another in the
evening before she turned in That same day in the evening she said
to me suddenly Do you know what Ive done Ive asked Jasper

Asked him what

Why if _she_ asked him you understand

I wondered _Do_ I understand

If you dont its because you regular wont as she says If that
girl really asked himon the balconyto sail with us

My dear lady do you suppose that if she did hed tell you

She had to recognise my acuteness Thats just what he says But he
says she didnt

And do you consider the statement valuable I asked laughing out You
had better ask your young friend herself

Mrs Nettlepoint stared I couldnt do that

On which I was the more amused that I had to explain I was only amused
What does it signify now

I thought you thought everything signified You were so full she
cried of signification

Yes but were further out now and somehow in midocean everything
becomes absolute

What else _can_ he do with decency Mrs Nettlepoint went on If as
my son he were never to speak to her it would be very rude and youd
think that stranger still Then _you_ would do what he does and where
would be the difference

How do you know what he does I havent mentioned him for twentyfour
hours

Why she told me herself She came in this afternoon

What an odd thing to tell you I commented

Not as she says it She says hes full of attention perfectly
devotedlooks after her all the time She seems to want me to know it
so that I may approve him for it

Thats charming it shows her good conscience

Yes or her great cleverness

Something in the tone in which Mrs Nettlepoint said this caused me to
return in real surprise Why what do you suppose she has in her mind

To get hold of him to make him go so far he cant retreat To marry
him perhaps

To marry him And what will she do with Mr Porterfield

Shell ask me just to make it all right to himor perhaps you

Yes as an old friendand for a moment I felt it awkwardly possible
But I put to her seriously _Do_ you see Jasper caught like that

Well hes only a boyhes younger at least than she

Precisely she regards him as a child She remarked to me herself
today that is that hes so much younger

Mrs Nettlepoint took this in Does she talk of it with you That shows
she has a plan that she has thought it over

Ive sufficiently expressedfor the interest of my anecdotethat I
found an oddity in one of our young companions but I was far from
judging her capable of laying a trap for the other Moreover my reading
of Jasper wasnt in the least that he was catchablecould be made to do
a thing if he didnt want to do it Of course it wasnt impossible that
he might be inclined that he might take itor already have taken
itinto his head to go further with his mothers charge but to believe
this I should require still more proof than his always being with her He
wanted at most to take up with her for the voyage If youve
questioned him perhaps youve tried to make him feel responsible I said
to my fellow critic

A little but its very difficult Interference makes him perverse One
has to go gently Besides its too absurdthink of her age If she
cant take care of herself cried Mrs Nettlepoint

Yes let us keep thinking of her age though its not so prodigious And
if things get very bad youve one resource left I added

She wondered To lock her up in her cabin

Noto come out of yours

Ah never never If it takes that to save her she must be lost
Besides what good would it do If I were to go above she could come
below

Yes but you could keep Jasper with you

_Could_ I Mrs Nettlepoint demanded in the manner of a woman who knew
her son

In the saloon the next day after dinner over the red cloth of the
tables beneath the swinging lamps and the racks of tumblers decanters
and wineglasses we sat down to whist Mrs Peck to oblige taking a
hand in the game She played very badly and talked too much and when
the rubber was over assuaged her discomfiture though not minewe had
been partners with a Welsh rabbit and a tumbler of something hot We
had done with the cards but while she waited for this refreshment she
sat with her elbows on the table shuffling a pack

She hasnt spoken to me yetshe wont do it she remarked in a moment

Is it possible theres any one on the ship who hasnt spoken to you

Not that girlshe knows too well Mrs Peck looked round our little
circle with a smile of intelligenceshe had familiar communicative eyes
Several of our company had assembled according to the wont the last
thing in the evening of those who are cheerful at sea for the
consumption of grilled sardines and devilled bones

What then does she know

Oh she knows _I_ know

Well we know what Mrs Peck knows one of the ladies of the group
observed to me with an air of privilege

Well you wouldnt know if I hadnt told youfrom the way she acts
said our friend with a laugh of small charm

Shes going out to a gentleman who lives over therehes waiting there
to marry her the other lady went on in the tone of authentic
information I remember that her name was Mrs Gotch and that her mouth
looked always as if she were whistling

Oh he knowsIve told him said Mrs Peck

Well I presume every one knows Mrs Gotch contributed

Dear madam is it every ones business I asked

Why dont you think its a peculiar way to actand Mrs Gotch was
evidently surprised at my little protest

Why its right therestraight in front of you like a play at the
theatreas if you had paid to see it said Mrs Peck If you dont
call it public

Arent you mixing things up What do you call public

Why the way they go on Theyre up there now

They cuddle up there half the night said Mrs Gotch I dont know
when they come down Any hour they like When all the lights are out
theyre up there still

Oh you cant tire them out They dont want relieflike the ships
watch laughed one of the gentlemen

Well if they enjoy each others society whats the harm another
asked Theyd do just the same on land

They wouldnt do it on the public streets I presume said Mrs Peck
And they wouldnt do it if Mr Porterfield was round

Isnt that just where your confusion comes in I made answer Its
public enough that Miss Mavis and Mr Nettlepoint are always together
but it isnt in the least public that shes going to be married

Why how can you saywhen the very sailors know it The Captain knows
it and all the officers know it They see them there especially at
night when theyre sailing the ship

I thought there was some rule submitted Mrs Gotch

Well there isthat youve got to behave yourself Mrs Peck
explained So the Captain told mehe said they have some rule He
said they have to have when people are too undignified

Is that the term he used I inquired

Well he may have said when they attract too much attention

I ventured to discriminate Its we who attract the attentionby
talking about what doesnt concern us and about what we really dont
know

She said the Captain said hed tell on her as soon as ever we arrive
Mrs Gotch none the less serenely pursued

_She_ said I repeated bewildered

Well he did say so that hed think it his duty to inform Mr
Porterfield when he comes on to meet herif they keep it up in the same
way said Mrs Peck

Oh theyll keep it up dont you fear one of the gentlemen exclaimed

Dear madam the Captains having his joke on you was however my own
congruous reply

No he ainthes right down scandalised He says he regards us all as
a real family and wants the family not to be downright coarse I felt
Mrs Peck irritated by my controversial tone she challenged me with
considerable spirit How can you say I dont know it when all the
street knows it and has known it for yearsfor years and years She
spoke as if the girl had been engaged at least for twenty Whats she
going out for if not to marry him

Perhaps shes going to see how he looks suggested one of the
gentlemen

Hed look queerif he knew

Well I guess hell know said Mrs Gotch

Shed tell him herselfshe wouldnt be afraid the gentleman went on

Well she might as well kill him Hell jump overboard Mrs Peck could
foretell

Jump overboard cried Mrs Gotch as if she hoped then that Mr
Porterfield would be told

He has just been waiting for thisfor long long years said Mrs
Peck

Do you happen to know him I asked

She replied at her convenience No but I know a lady who does Are
you going up

I had risen from my placeI had not ordered supper Im going to take
a turn before going to bed

Well then youll see

Outside the saloon I hesitated for Mrs Pecks admonition made me feel
for a moment that if I went up I should have entered in a manner into her
little conspiracy But the night was so warm and splendid that I had
been intending to smoke a cigar in the air before going below and I
didnt see why I should deprive myself of this pleasure in order to seem
not to mind Mrs Peck I mounted accordingly and saw a few figures
sitting or moving about in the darkness The ocean looked black and
small as it is apt to do at night and the long mass of the ship with
its vague dim wings seemed to take up a great part of it There were
more stars than one saw on land and the heavens struck one more than ever
as larger than the earth Grace Mavis and her companion were not so far
as I perceived at first among the few passengers who lingered late and
I was glad because I hated to hear her talked about in the manner of the
gossips I had left at supper I wished there had been some way to
prevent it but I could think of none but to recommend her privately to
reconsider her rule of discretion That would be a very delicate
business and perhaps it would be better to begin with Jasper though
that would be delicate too At any rate one might let him know in a
friendly spirit to how much remark he exposed the young ladyleaving
this revelation to work its way upon him Unfortunately I couldnt
altogether believe that the pair were unconscious of the observation and
the opinion of the passengers They werent boy and girl they had a
certain social perspective in their eye I was meanwhile at any rate in
no possession of the details of that behaviour which had made
themaccording to the version of my good friends in the saloona
scandal to the ship for though I had taken due note of them as will
already have been gathered I had taken really no such ferocious or at
least such competent note as Mrs Peck Nevertheless the probability
was that they knew what was thought of themwhat naturally would beand
simply didnt care That made our heroine out rather perverse and even
rather shameless and yet somehow if these were her leanings I didnt
dislike her for them I dont know what strange secret excuses I found
for her I presently indeed encountered on the spot a need for any I
might have at call since just as I was on the point of going below
again after several restless turns andwithin the limit where smoking
was allowedas many puffs at a cigar as I cared for I became aware of a
couple of figures settled together behind one of the lifeboats that
rested on the deck They were so placed as to be visible only to a
person going close to the rail and peering a little sidewise I dont
think I peered but as I stood a moment beside the rail my eye was
attracted by a dusky object that protruded beyond the boat and that I saw
at a second glance to be the tail of a ladys dress I bent forward an
instant but even then I saw very little more that scarcely mattered
however as I easily concluded that the persons tucked away in so snug a
corner were Jasper Nettlepoint and Mr Porterfields intended Tucked
away was the odious right expression and I deplored the fact so betrayed
for the pitiful bad taste in it I immediately turned away and the next
moment found myself face to face with our vessels skipper I had
already had some conversation with himhe had been so good as to invite
me as he had invited Mrs Nettlepoint and her son and the young lady
travelling with them and also Mrs Peck to sit at his tableand had
observed with pleasure that his seamanship had the grace not universal
on the Atlantic liners of a fineweather manner

They dont waste much timeyour friends in there he said nodding in
the direction in which he had seen me looking

Ah well they havent much to lose

Thats what I mean Im told _she_ hasnt

I wanted to say something exculpatory but scarcely knew what note to
strike I could only look vaguely about me at the starry darkness and
the sea that seemed to sleep Well with these splendid nights and this
perfect air people are beguiled into late hours

Yes we want a bit of a blow the Captain said

I demurred How much of one

Enough to clear the decks

He was after all rather dry and he went about his business He had made
me uneasy and instead of going below I took a few turns more The other
walkers dropped off pair by pairthey were all mentill at last I was
alone Then after a little I quitted the field Jasper and his
companion were still behind their lifeboat Personally I greatly
preferred our actual conditions but as I went down I found myself
vaguely wishing in the interest of I scarcely knew what unless it had
been a mere superstitious delicacy that we might have half a gale

Miss Mavis turned out in seaphrase early for the next morning I saw
her come up only a short time after I had finished my breakfast a
ceremony over which I contrived not to dawdle She was alone and Jasper
Nettlepoint by a rare accident was not on deck to help her I went to
meet hershe was encumbered as usual with her shawl her sunumbrella
and a bookand laid my hands on her chair placing it near the stern of
the ship where she liked best to be But I proposed to her to walk a
little before she sat down and she took my arm after I had put her
accessories into the chair The deck was clear at that hour and the
morning light gay one had an extravagant sense of good omens and
propitious airs I forget what we spoke of first but it was because I
felt these things pleasantly and not to torment my companion nor to test
her that I couldnt help exclaiming cheerfully after a moment as I have
mentioned having done the first day Well were getting on were
getting on

Oh yes I count every hour

The last days always go quicker I said and the last hours

Well the last hours she asked for I had instinctively checked
myself

Oh ones so glad then that its almost the same as if one had arrived
Yet we ought to be grateful when the elements have been so kind to us I
added I hope youll have enjoyed the voyage

She hesitated ever so little Yes much more than I expected

Did you think it would be very bad

Horrible horrible

The tone of these words was strange but I hadnt much time to reflect
upon it for turning round at that moment I saw Jasper Nettlepoint come
toward us He was still distant by the expanse of the white deck and I
couldnt help taking him in from head to foot as he drew nearer I dont
know what rendered me on this occasion particularly sensitive to the
impression but it struck me that I saw him as I had never seen him
before saw him thanks to the intense sealight inside and out in his
personal his moral totality It was a quick a vivid revelation if it
only lasted a moment it had a simplifying certifying effect He was
intrinsically a pleasing apparition with his handsome young face and
that marked absence of any drop in his personal arrangements which more
than any one Ive ever seen he managed to exhibit on shipboard He had
none of the appearance of wearing out old clothes that usually prevails
there but dressed quite straight as I heard some one say This gave
him an assured almost a triumphant air as of a young man who would come
best out of any awkwardness I expected to feel my companions hand
loosen itself on my arm as an indication that now she must go to him
and I was almost surprised she didnt drop me We stopped as we met and
Jasper bade us a friendly goodmorning Of course the remark that we had
another lovely day was already indicated and it led him to exclaim in
the manner of one to whom criticism came easily Yes but with this sort
of thing consider what one of the others would do

One of the other ships

We should be there now or at any rate tomorrow

Well then Im glad it isnt one of the othersand I smiled at the
young lady on my arm My words offered her a chance to say something
appreciative and gave him one even more but neither Jasper nor Grace
Mavis took advantage of the occasion What they did do I noticed was
to look at each other rather fixedly an instant after which she turned
her eyes silently to the sea She made no movement and uttered no sound
contriving to give me the sense that she had all at once become perfectly
passive that she somehow declined responsibility We remained standing
there with Jasper in front of us and if the contact of her arm didnt
suggest I should give her up neither did it intimate that we had better
pass on I had no idea of giving her up albeit one of the things I
seemed to read just then into Jaspers countenance was a fine implication
that she was his property His eyes met mine for a moment and it was
exactly as if he had said to me I know what you think but I dont care
a rap What I really thought was that he was selfish beyond the limits
that was the substance of my little revelation Youth is almost always
selfish just as it is almost always conceited and after all when its
combined with health and good parts good looks and good spirits it has
a right to be and I easily forgive it if it be really youth Still its
a question of degree and what stuck out of Jasper Nettlepointif of
course one had the intelligence for itwas that his egotism had a
hardness his love of his own way an avidity These elements were jaunty
and prosperous they were accustomed to prevail He was fond very fond
of women they were necessary to himthat was in his type but he wasnt
in the least in love with Grace Mavis Among the reflexions I quickly
made this was the one that was most to the point There was a degree of
awkwardness after a minute in the way we were planted there though the
apprehension of it was doubtless not in the least with himself To
dissimulate my own share in it at any rate I asked him how his mother
might be

His answer was unexpected You had better go down and see

Not till Miss Mavis is tired of me

She said nothing to this and I made her walk again For some minutes she
failed to speak then rather abruptly she began Ive seen you talking
to that lady who sits at our tablethe one who has so many children

Mrs Peck Oh yes one has inevitably talked with Mrs Peck

Do you know her very well

Only as one knows people at sea An acquaintance makes itself It
doesnt mean very much

She doesnt speak to meshe might if she wanted

Thats just what she says of youthat you might speak to her

Oh if shes waiting for that said my companion with a laugh Then she
added She lives in our street nearly opposite

Precisely Thats the reason why she thinks you coy or haughty She
has seen you so often and seems to know so much about you

What does she know about me

Ah you must ask herI cant tell you

I dont care what she knows said my young lady After a moment she
went on She must have seen I aint very sociable And then What are
you laughing at she asked

Wellmy amusement was difficult to explainyoure not very sociable
and yet somehow you are Mrs Peck is at any rate and thought that
ought to make it easy for you to enter into conversation with her

Oh I dont care for her conversationI know what it amounts to I
made no replyI scarcely knew what reply to makeand the girl went on
I know what she thinks and I know what she says Still I was silent
but the next moment I saw my discretion had been wasted for Miss Mavis
put to me straight Does she make out that she knows Mr Porterfield

No she only claims she knows a lady who knows him

Yes thats itMrs Jeremie Mrs Jeremies an idiot I wasnt in a
position to controvert this and presently my young lady said she would
sit down I left her in her chairI saw that she preferred itand
wandered to a distance A few minutes later I met Jasper again and he
stopped of his own accord to say We shall be in about six in the
evening of our eleventh daythey promise it

If nothing happens of course

Well whats going to happen

Thats just what Im wondering And I turned away and went below with
the foolish but innocent satisfaction of thinking I had mystified him




CHAPTER IV


I dont know what to do and you must help me Mrs Nettlepoint said to
me that evening as soon as I looked in

Ill do what I canbut whats the matter

She has been crying here and going onshe has quite upset me

Crying She doesnt look like that

Exactly and thats what startled me She came in to see me this
afternoon as she has done before and we talked of the weather and the
run of the ship and the manners of the stewardess and other such trifles
and then suddenly in the midst of it as she sat there on no visible
pretext she burst into tears I asked her what ailed her and tried to
comfort her but she didnt explain she said it was nothing the effect
of the sea of the monotony of the excitement of leaving home I asked
her if it had anything to do with her prospects with her marriage
whether she finds as this draws near that her heart isnt in it I told
her she mustnt be nervous that I could enter into thatin short I said
what I could All she replied was that she _is_ nervous very nervous
but that it was already over and then she jumped up and kissed me and
went away Does she look as if she has been crying Mrs Nettlepoint
wound up

How can I tell when she never quits that horrid veil Its as if she
were ashamed to show her face

Shes keeping it for Liverpool But I dont like such incidents said
Mrs Nettlepoint I think I ought to go above

And is that where you want me to help you

Oh with your arm and that sort of thing yes But I may have to look to
you for something more I feel as if something were going to happen

Thats exactly what I said to Jasper this morning

And what did he say

He only looked innocentas if he thought I meant a fog or a storm

Heaven forbidit isnt that I shall never be goodnatured again
Mrs Nettlepoint went on never have a girl put on me that way You
always pay for itthere are always tiresome complications What Im
afraid of is after we get there Shell throw up her engagement there
will be dreadful scenes I shall be mixed up with them and have to look
after her and keep her with me I shall have to stay there with her till
she can be sent back or even take her up to London Do you see all
that

I listened respectfully after which I observed Youre afraid of your
son

She also had a pause It depends on how you mean it

There are things you might say to himand with your manner because you
have one you know when you choose

Very likely but whats my manner to his Besides I _have_ said
everything to him That is Ive said the great thingthat hes making
her immensely talked about

And of course in answer to that he has asked you how you know and
youve told him you have it from me

Ive had to tell him and he says its none of your business

I wish hed say that I remarked to my face

Hell do so perfectly if you give him a chance Thats where you can
help me Quarrel with himhes rather good at a quarrel and that will
divert him and draw him off

Then Im ready I returned to discuss the matter with him for the
rest of the voyage

Very well I count on you But hell ask you as he asks me what the
deuce you want him to do

To go to bedand Im afraid I laughed

Oh it isnt a joke

I didnt want to be irritating but I made my point Thats exactly
what I told you at first

Yes but dont exult I hate people who exult Jasper asks of me she
went on why he should mind her being talked about if she doesnt mind
it herself

Ill tell him why I replied and Mrs Nettlepoint said she should be
exceedingly obliged to me and repeated that she would indeed take the
field

I looked for Jasper above that same evening but circumstances didnt
favour my quest I found himthat is I gathered he was again ensconced
behind the lifeboat with Miss Mavis but there was a needless violence in
breaking into their communion and I put off our interview till the next
day Then I took the first opportunity at breakfast to make sure of
it He was in the saloon when I went in and was preparing to leave the
table but I stopped him and asked if he would give me a quarter of an
hour on deck a little laterthere was something particular I wanted to
say to him He said Oh yes if you likewith just a visible surprise
but I thought with plenty of assurance When I had finished my breakfast
I found him smoking on the forwarddeck and I immediately began Im
going to say something you wont at all like to ask you a question
youll probably denounce for impertinent

I certainly shall if I find it so said Jasper Nettlepoint

Well of course my warning has meant that I dont care if you do Im a
good deal older than you and Im a friendof many yearsof your mother
Theres nothing I like less than to be meddlesome but I think these
things give me a certain righta sort of privilege Besides which my
inquiry will speak for itself

Why so many damned preliminaries my young man asked through his smoke

We looked into each others eyes a moment What indeed was his mothers
mannerher best mannercompared with his Are you prepared to be
responsible

To you

Dear noto the young lady herself Im speaking of course of Miss
Mavis

Ah yes my mother tells me you have her greatly on your mind

So has your mother herselfnow

Shes so good as to say soto oblige you

Shed oblige me a great deal more by reassuring me I know perfectly of
your knowing Ive told her that Miss Mavis is greatly talked about

Yes but what on earth does it matter

It matters as a sign

A sign of what

That shes in a false position

Jasper puffed his cigar with his eyes on the horizon and I had a little
unexpectedly the sense of producing a certain effect on him I dont
know whether its _your_ business what youre attempting to discuss but
it really strikes me its none of mine What have I to do with the
tattle with which a pack of old women console themselves for not being
seasick

Do you call it tattle that Miss Mavis is in love with you

Drivelling

Then I retorted youre very ungrateful The tattle of a pack of old
women has this importance that she suspects or she knows it exists
and that decent girls are for the most part very sensitive to that sort
of thing To be prepared not to heed it in this case she must have a
reason and the reason must be the one Ive taken the liberty to call
your attention to

In love with me in six days just like thatand he still looked away
through narrowed eyelids

Theres no accounting for tastes and six days at sea are equivalent to
sixty on land I dont want to make you too proud Of course if you
recognise your responsibility its all right and Ive nothing to say

I dont see what you mean he presently returned

Surely you ought to have thought of that by this time Shes engaged to
be married and the gentleman shes engaged to is to meet her at
Liverpool The whole ship knows itthough _I_ didnt tell themand
the whole ships watching her Its impertinent if you like just as I
am myself but we make a little world here together and we cant blink
its conditions What I ask you is whether youre prepared to allow her
to give up the gentleman Ive just mentioned for your sake

Jasper spoke in a moment as if he didnt understand For my sake

To marry her if she breaks with him

He turned his eyes from the horizon to my own and I found a strange
expression in them Has Miss Mavis commissioned you to go into that

Not in the least

Well then I dont quite see

It isnt as from another I make it Let it come from yourself_to_
yourself

Lord you must think I lead myself a life he cried as in compassion
for my simplicity Thats a question the young lady may put to me any
moment it pleases her

Let me then express the hope that she will But what will you answer

My dear sir it seems to me that in spite of all the titles youve
enumerated youve no reason to expect Ill tell you He turned away
and I dedicated in perfect sincerity a deep sore sigh to the thought of
our young woman At this under the impression of it he faced me again
and looking at me from head to foot demanded What is it you want me
to do

I put it to your mother that you ought to go to bed

You had better do that yourself he replied

This time he walked off and I reflected rather dolefully that the only
clear result of my undertaking would probably have been to make it vivid
to him that she was in love with him Mrs Nettlepoint came up as she
had announced but the day was half over it was nearly three oclock
She was accompanied by her son who established her on deck arranged her
chair and her shawls saw she was protected from sun and wind and for an
hour was very properly attentive While this went on Grace Mavis was not
visible nor did she reappear during the whole afternoon I hadnt
observed that she had as yet been absent from the deck for so long a
period Jasper left his mother but came back at intervals to see how
she got on and when she asked where Miss Mavis might be answered that he
hadnt the least idea I sat with my friend at her particular request
she told me she knew that if I didnt Mrs Peck and Mrs Gotch would make
their approach so that I must act as a watchdog She was flurried and
fatigued with her migration and I think that Grace Maviss choosing this
occasion for retirement suggested to her a little that she had been made
a fool of She remarked that the girls not being there showed her for
the barbarian she only could be and that she herself was really very
good so to have put herself out her charge was a mere bore that was the
end of it I could see that my companions advent quickened the
speculative activity of the other ladies they watched her from the
opposite side of the deck keeping their eyes fixed on her very much as
the man at the wheel kept his on the course of the ship Mrs Peck
plainly had designs and it was from this danger that Mrs Nettlepoint
averted her face

Its just as we said she remarked to me as we sat there Its like
the buckets in the well When I come up everything else goes down

No not at all everything elsesince Jasper remains here

Remains I dont see him

He comes and goesits the same thing

He goes more than he comes But _nen parlons plus_ I havent gained
anything I dont admire the sea at allwhat is it but a magnified
watertank I shant come up again

Ive an idea shell stay in her cabin now I said She tells me she
has one to herself Mrs Nettlepoint replied that she might do as she
liked and I repeated to her the little conversation I had had with
Jasper

She listened with interest but Marry her Mercy she exclaimed I
like the fine freedom with which you give my son away

You wouldnt accept that

Why in the world should I

Then I dont understand your position

Good heavens I _have_ none It isnt a position to be tired of the
whole thing

You wouldnt accept it even in the case I put to himthat of her
believing she had been encouraged to throw over poor Porterfield

Not evennot even Who can know what she believes

It brought me back to where we had started from Then you do exactly
what I said you wouldyou show me a fine example of maternal
immorality

Maternal fiddlesticks It was she who began it

Then why did you come up today I asked

To keep you quiet

Mrs Nettlepoints dinner was served on deck but I went into the saloon
Jasper was there but not Grace Mavis as I had halfexpected I sought
to learn from him what had become of her if she were illhe must have
thought I had an odious pertinacityand he replied that he knew nothing
whatever about her Mrs Peck talked to meor tried toof Mrs
Nettlepoint expatiating on the great interest it had been to see her
only it was a pity she didnt seem more sociable To this I made answer
that she was to be excused on the score of health

You dont mean to say shes sick on this pond

No shes unwell in another way

I guess I know the way Mrs Peck laughed And then she added I
suppose she came up to look after her pet

Her pet I set my face

Why Miss Mavis Weve talked enough about that

Quite enough I dont know what that has had to do with it Miss
Mavis so far as Ive noticed hasnt been above today

Oh it goes on all the same

It goes on

Well its too late

Too late

Well youll see Therell be a row

This wasnt comforting but I didnt repeat it on deck Mrs Nettlepoint
returned early to her cabin professing herself infinitely spent I
didnt know what went on but Grace Mavis continued not to show I
looked in late for a goodnight to my friend and learned from her that
the girl hadnt been to her She had sent the stewardess to her room for
news to see if she were ill and needed assistance and the stewardess
had come back with mere mention of her not being there I went above
after this the night was not quite so fair and the deck almost empty In
a moment Jasper Nettlepoint and our young lady moved past me together I
hope youre better I called after her and she tossed me over her
shoulderOh yes I had a headache but the air now does me good

I went down againI was the only person there but they and I wanted not
to seem to dog their stepsand returning to Mrs Nettlepoints room
found her door was open to the little passage that she was still
sitting up

Shes all right I said Shes on the deck with Jasper

The good lady looked up at me from her book I didnt know you called
that all right

Well its better than something else

Than what else

Something I was a little afraid of Mrs Nettlepoint continued to look
at me she asked again what that might be Ill tell you when were
ashore I said

The next day I waited on her at the usual hour of my morning visit and
found her not a little distraught The scenes have begun she said
you know I told you I shouldnt get through without them You made me
nervous last nightI havent the least idea what you meant but you made
me horribly nervous She came in to see me an hour ago and I had the
courage to say to her I dont know why I shouldnt tell you frankly
that Ive been scolding my son about you Of course she asked what I
meant by that and I let her know It seems to me he drags you about
the ship too much for a girl in your position He has the air of not
remembering that you belong to some one else Theres a want of taste
and even a want of respect in it That brought on an outbreak she
became very violent

Do you mean indignant

Yes indignant and above all flustered and excitedat my presuming to
suppose her relations with my son not the very simplest in the world I
might scold him as much as I likedthat was between ourselves but she
didnt see why I should mention such matters to herself Did I think she
allowed him to treat her with disrespect That idea wasnt much of a
compliment to either of them He had treated her better and been kinder
to her than most other peoplethere were very few on the ship who hadnt
been insulting She should be glad enough when she got off it to her
own people to some one whom nobody would have a right to speak of What
was there in her position that wasnt perfectly natural what was the
idea of making a fuss about her position Did I mean that she took it
too easilythat she didnt think as much as she ought about Mr
Porterfield Didnt I believe she was attached to himdidnt I believe
she was just counting the hours till she saw him That would be the
happiest moment of her life It showed how little I knew her if I
thought anything else

All that must have been rather fineI should have liked to hear it I
said after quite hanging on my friends lips And what did you reply

Oh I grovelled I assured her that I accused heras regards my sonof
nothing worse than an excess of good nature She helped him to pass his
timehe ought to be immensely obliged Also that it would be a very
happy moment for me too when I should hand her over to Mr Porterfield

And will you come up today

No indeedI think shell do beautifully now

I heaved this time a sigh of relief Alls well that ends well

Jasper spent that day a great deal of time with his mother She had told
me how much she had lacked hitherto proper opportunity to talk over with
him their movements after disembarking Everything changes a little the
last two or three days of a voyage the spell is broken and new
combinations take place Grace Mavis was neither on deck nor at dinner
and I drew Mrs Pecks attention to the extreme propriety with which she
now conducted herself She had spent the day in meditation and judged it
best to continue to meditate

Ah shes afraid said my implacable neighbour

Afraid of what

Well that well tell tales when we get there

Whom do you mean by we

Well there are plentyon a ship like this

Then I think I returned we wont

Maybe we wont have the chance said the dreadful little woman

Oh at that momentI spoke from a full experienceuniversal geniality
reigns

Mrs Peck however knew little of any such law I guess shes afraid all
the same

So much the better

Yesso much the better

All the next day too the girl remained invisible and Mrs Nettlepoint
told me she hadnt looked in She herself had accordingly inquired by
the stewardess if she might be received in Miss Maviss own quarters and
the young lady had replied that they were littered up with things and
unfit for visitors she was packing a trunk over Jasper made up for his
devotion to his mother the day before by now spending a great deal of his
time in the smokingroom I wanted to say to him This is much better
but I thought it wiser to hold my tongue Indeed I had begun to feel the
emotion of prospective arrivalthe sense of the return to Europe always
kept its intensityand had thereby the less attention for other matters
It will doubtless appear to the critical reader that my expenditure of
interest had been out of proportion to the vulgar appearances of which my
story gives an account but to this I can only reply that the event was
to justify me We sighted land the dim yet rich coast of Ireland about
sunset and I leaned on the bulwark and took it in It doesnt look
like much does it I heard a voice say beside me whereupon turning
I found Grace Mavis at hand Almost for the first time she had her veil
up and I thought her very pale

It will be more tomorrow I said

Oh yes a great deal more

The first sight of land at sea changes everything I went on It
always affects me as waking up from a dream Its a return to reality

For a moment she made me no response then she said It doesnt look very
real yet

No and meanwhile this lovely evening one can put it that the dreams
still present

She looked up at the sky which had a brightness though the light of the
sun had left it and that of the stars hadnt begun It _is_ a lovely
evening

Oh yes with this we shall do

She stood some moments more while the growing dusk effaced the line of
the land more rapidly than our progress made it distinct She said
nothing more she only looked in front of her but her very quietness
prompted me to something suggestive of sympathy and service It was
difficult indeed to strike the right notesome things seemed too wide of
the mark and others too importunate At last unexpectedly she appeared
to give me my chance Irrelevantly abruptly she broke out Didnt you
tell me you knew Mr Porterfield

Dear me yesI used to see him Ive often wanted to speak to you of
him

She turned her face on me and in the deepened evening I imagined her more
pale What good would that do

Why it would be a pleasure I replied rather foolishly

Do you mean for you

Well yescall it that I smiled

Did you know him so well

My smile became a laugh and I lost a little my confidence Youre not
easy to make speeches to

I hate speeches The words came from her lips with a force that
surprised me they were loud and hard But before I had time to wonder
she went on a little differently Shall you know him when you see him

Perfectly I think Her manner was so strange that I had to notice it
in some way and I judged the best way was jocularly so I added Shant
you

Oh perhaps youll point him out And she walked quickly away As I
looked after her there came to me a perverse rather a provoking
consciousness of having during the previous days and especially in
speaking to Jasper Nettlepoint interfered with her situation in some
degree to her loss There was an odd pang for me in seeing her move
about alone I felt somehow responsible for it and asked myself why I
couldnt have kept my hands off I had seen Jasper in the smokingroom
more than once that day as I passed it and half an hour before this had
observed through the open door that he was there He had been with her
so much that without him she now struck one as bereaved and forsaken
This was really better no doubt but superficially it movedand I admit
with the last inconsequenceones pity Mrs Peck would doubtless have
assured me that their separation was gammon they didnt show together on
deck and in the saloon but they made it up elsewhere The secret places
on shipboard are not numerous Mrs Pecks elsewhere would have been
vague and I know not what licence her imagination took It was distinct
that Jasper had fallen off but of course what had passed between them on
this score wasnt so and could never be Later on through his mother I
had _his_ version of that but I may remark that I gave it no credit
Poor Mrs Nettlepoint on the other hand was of course to give it all I
was almost capable after the girl had left me of going to my young man
and saying After all do return to her a little just till we get in
It wont make any difference after we land And I dont think it was
the fear he would tell me I was an idiot that prevented me At any rate
the next time I passed the door of the smokingroom I saw he had left it
I paid my usual visit to Mrs Nettlepoint that night but I troubled her
no further about Miss Mavis She had made up her mind that everything
was smooth and settled now and it seemed to me I had worried her and
that she had worried herself in sufficiency I left her to enjoy the
deepening foretaste of arrival which had taken possession of her mind
Before turning in I went above and found more passengers on deck than I
had ever seen so late Jasper moved about among them alone but I
forbore to join him The coast of Ireland had disappeared but the night
and the sea were perfect On the way to my cabin when I came down I
met the stewardess in one of the passages and the idea entered my head
to say to her Do you happen to know where Miss Mavis is

Why shes in her room sir at this hour

Do you suppose I could speak to her It had come into my mind to ask
her why she had wanted to know of me if I should recognise Mr
Porterfield

No sir said the stewardess she has gone to bed

Thats all right And I followed the young ladys excellent example

The next morning while I dressed the steward of my side of the ship
came to me as usual to see what I wanted But the first thing he said
to me was Rather a bad job sira passenger missing And while I
took I scarce know what instant chill from it A lady sir he went
onwhom I think you knew Poor Miss Mavis sir

_Missing_ I criedstaring at him and horrorstricken

Shes not on the ship They cant find her

Then where to God is she

I recall his queer face Well sir I suppose you know that as well as
I

Do you mean she has jumped overboard

Some time in the night siron the quiet But its beyond every one
the way she escaped notice They usually sees em sir It must have
been about halfpast two Lord but she was sharp sir She didnt so
much as make a splash They say she _ad_ come against her will sir

I had dropped upon my sofaI felt faint The man went on liking to
talk as persons of his class do when they have something horrible to
tell She usually rang for the stewardess early but this morning of
course there had been no ring The stewardess had gone in all the same
about eight oclock and found the cabin empty That was about an hour
previous Her things were there in confusionthe things she usually
wore when she went above The stewardess thought she had been a bit odd
the night before but had waited a little and then gone back Miss Mavis
hadnt turned upand she didnt turn up The stewardess began to look
for hershe hadnt been seen on deck or in the saloon Besides she
wasnt dressednot to show herself all her clothes were in her room
There was another lady an old lady Mrs NettlepointI would know
herthat she was sometimes with but the stewardess had been with _her_
and knew Miss Mavis hadnt come near her that morning She had spoken to
_him_ and they had taken a quiet lookthey had hunted everywhere A
ships a big place but you did come to the end of it and if a person
wasnt there why there it was In short an hour had passed and the young
lady was not accounted for from which I might judge if she ever would
be The watch couldnt account for her but no doubt the fishes in the
sea couldpoor miserable pitiful lady The stewardess and he had of
course thought it their duty to speak at once to the Doctor and the
Doctor had spoken immediately to the Captain The Captain didnt like
itthey never did but hed try to keep it quietthey always did

By the time I succeeded in pulling myself together and getting on after
a fashion the rest of my clothes I had learned that Mrs Nettlepoint
wouldnt yet have been told unless the stewardess had broken it to her
within the previous few minutes Her son knew the young gentleman on
the other side of the shiphe had the other steward my man had seen him
come out of his cabin and rush above just before he came in to me He
_had_ gone above my man was sure he hadnt gone to the old ladys
cabin I catch again the sense of my dreadfully seeing something at that
moment catch the wild flash under the stewards words of Jasper
Nettlepoint leaping with a mad compunction in his young agility over
the side of the ship I hasten to add however that no such incident
was destined to contribute its horror to poor Grace Maviss unwitnessed
and unlighted tragic act What followed was miserable enough but I can
only glance at it When I got to Mrs Nettlepoints door she was there
with a shawl about her the stewardess had just told her and she was
dashing out to come to me I made her go backI said I would go for
Jasper I went for him but I missed him partly no doubt because it was
really at first the Captain I was after I found this personage and
found him highly scandalised but he gave me no hope that we were in
error and his displeasure expressed with seamanlike strength was a
definite settlement of the question From the deck where I merely
turned round and looked I saw the light of another summer day the coast
of Ireland green and near and the sea of a more charming colour than it
had shown at all When I came below again Jasper had passed back he had
gone to his cabin and his mother had joined him there He remained there
till we reached LiverpoolI never saw him His mother after a little
at his request left him alone All the world went above to look at the
land and chatter about our tragedy but the poor lady spent the day
dismally enough in her room It seemed to me the dreadful day
intolerably long I was thinking so of vague of inconceivable yet
inevitable Porterfield and of my having to face him somehow on the
morrow Now of course I knew why she had asked me if I should recognise
him she had delegated to me mentally a certain pleasant office I gave
Mrs Peck and Mrs Gotch a wide berthI couldnt talk to them I could
or at least I did a little to Mrs Nettlepoint but with too many
reserves for comfort on either side since I quite felt how little it
would now make for ease to mention Jasper to her I was obliged to
assume by my silence that he had had nothing to do with what had
happened and of course I never really ascertained what he _had_ had to
do The secret of what passed between him and the strange girl who would
have sacrificed her marriage to him on so short an acquaintance remains
shut up in his breast His mother I know went to his door from time to
time but he refused her admission That evening to be human at a
venture I requested the steward to go in and ask him if he should care
to see me and the good man returned with an answer which he candidly
transmitted Not in the leastJasper apparently was almost as
scandalised as the Captain

At Liverpool at the dock when we had touched twenty people came on
board and I had already made out Mr Porterfield at a distance He was
looking up at the side of the great vessel with disappointment
writtenfor my strained eyesin his face disappointment at not seeing
the woman he had so long awaited lean over it and wave her handkerchief
to him Every one was looking at him every one but shehis identity
flew about in a momentand I wondered if it didnt strike him He used
to be gaunt and angular but had grown almost fat and stooped a little
The interval between us diminishedhe was on the plank and then on the
deck with the jostling agents of the Customs too soon for my equanimity
I met him instantly however to save him from exposurelaid my hand on
him and drew him away though I was sure he had no impression of having
seen me before It was not till afterwards that I thought this rather
characteristically dull of him I drew him far awayI was conscious of
Mrs Peck and Mrs Gotch looking at us as we passedinto the empty
stale smokingroom he remained speechless and that struck me as like
him I had to speak first he couldnt even relieve me by saying Is
anything the matter I broke ground by putting it feebly that she was
ill It was a dire moment
