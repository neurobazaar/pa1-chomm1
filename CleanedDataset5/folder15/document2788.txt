LIFE AT PLUMFIELD WITH JOS BOYS



CHAPTER I NAT

Please sir is this Plumfield asked a ragged boy of the man who
opened the great gate at which the omnibus left him

Yes Who sent you

Mr Laurence I have got a letter for the lady

All right go up to the house and give it to her shell see to you
little chap

The man spoke pleasantly and the boy went on feeling much cheered by
the words Through the soft spring rain that fell on sprouting grass
and budding trees Nat saw a large square house before him a
hospitablelooking house with an oldfashioned porch wide steps and
lights shining in many windows Neither curtains nor shutters hid the
cheerful glimmer and pausing a moment before he rang Nat saw many
little shadows dancing on the walls heard the pleasant hum of young
voices and felt that it was hardly possible that the light and warmth
and comfort within could be for a homeless little chap like him

I hope the lady will see to me he thought and gave a timid rap with
the great bronze knocker which was a jovial griffins head

A rosyfaced servantmaid opened the door and smiled as she took the
letter which he silently offered She seemed used to receiving strange
boys for she pointed to a seat in the hall and said with a nod

Sit there and drip on the mat a bit while I take this in to missis

Nat found plenty to amuse him while he waited and stared about him
curiously enjoying the view yet glad to do so unobserved in the dusky
recess by the door

The house seemed swarming with boys who were beguiling the rainy
twilight with all sorts of amusements There were boys everywhere
upstairs and downstairs and in the ladys chamber apparently for
various open doors showed pleasant groups of big boys little boys
and middlesized boys in all stages of evening relaxation not to say
effervescence Two large rooms on the right were evidently schoolrooms
for desks maps blackboards and books were scattered about An open
fire burned on the hearth and several indolent lads lay on their backs
before it discussing a new cricketground with such animation that
their boots waved in the air A tall youth was practising on the flute
in one corner quite undisturbed by the racket all about him Two or
three others were jumping over the desks pausing now and then to get
their breath and laugh at the droll sketches of a little wag who was
caricaturing the whole household on a blackboard

In the room on the left a long suppertable was seen set forth with
great pitchers of new milk piles of brown and white bread and perfect
stacks of the shiny gingerbread so dear to boyish souls A flavor of
toast was in the air also suggestions of baked apples very tantalizing
to one hungry little nose and stomach

The hall however presented the most inviting prospect of all for
a brisk game of tag was going on in the upper entry One landing
was devoted to marbles the other to checkers while the stairs were
occupied by a boy reading a girl singing a lullaby to her doll two
puppies a kitten and a constant succession of small boys sliding down
the banisters to the great detriment of their clothes and danger to
their limbs

So absorbed did Nat become in this exciting race that he ventured
farther and farther out of his corner and when one very lively boy
came down so swiftly that he could not stop himself but fell off the
banisters with a crash that would have broken any head but one rendered
nearly as hard as a cannonball by eleven years of constant bumping Nat
forgot himself and ran up to the fallen rider expecting to find him
halfdead The boy however only winked rapidly for a second then lay
calmly looking up at the new face with a surprised Hullo

Hullo returned Nat not knowing what else to say and thinking that
form of reply both brief and easy

Are you a new boy asked the recumbent youth without stirring

Dont know yet

Whats your name

Nat Blake

Mines Tommy Bangs Come up and have a go will you and Tommy got
upon his legs like one suddenly remembering the duties of hospitality

Guess I wont till I see whether Im going to stay or not returned
Nat feeling the desire to stay increase every moment

I say Demi heres a new one Come and see to him and the lively
Thomas returned to his sport with unabated relish

At his call the boy reading on the stairs looked up with a pair of big
brown eyes and after an instants pause as if a little shy he put the
book under his arm and came soberly down to greet the newcomer who
found something very attractive in the pleasant face of this slender
mildeyed boy

Have you seen Aunt Jo he asked as if that was some sort of important
ceremony

I havent seen anybody yet but you boys Im waiting answered Nat

Did Uncle Laurie send you proceeded Demi politely but gravely

Mr Laurence did

He is Uncle Laurie and he always sends nice boys

Nat looked gratified at the remark and smiled in a way that made his
thin face very pleasant He did not know what to say next so the two
stood staring at one another in friendly silence till the little girl
came up with her doll in her arms She was very like Demi only not so
tall and had a rounder rosier face and blue eyes

This is my sister Daisy announced Demi as if presenting a rare and
precious creature

The children nodded to one another and the little girls face dimpled
with pleasure as she said affably

I hope youll stay We have such good times here dont we Demi

Of course we do thats what Aunt Jo has Plumfield for

It seems a very nice place indeed observed Nat feeling that he must
respond to these amiable young persons

Its the nicest place in the world isnt it Demi said Daisy who
evidently regarded her brother as authority on all subjects

No I think Greenland where the icebergs and seals are is more
interesting But Im fond of Plumfield and it is a very nice place
to be in returned Demi who was interested just now in a book on
Greenland He was about to offer to show Nat the pictures and
explain them when the servant returned saying with a nod toward the
parlordoor

All right you are to stop

Im glad now come to Aunt Jo And Daisy took him by the hand with a
pretty protecting air which made Nat feel at home at once

Demi returned to his beloved book while his sister led the newcomer
into a back room where a stout gentleman was frolicking with two little
boys on the sofa and a thin lady was just finishing the letter which
she seemed to have been rereading

Here he is aunty cried Daisy

So this is my new boy I am glad to see you my dear and hope youll
be happy here said the lady drawing him to her and stroking back the
hair from his forehead with a kind hand and a motherly look which made
Nats lonely little heart yearn toward her

She was not at all handsome but she had a merry sort of face that never
seemed to have forgotten certain childish ways and looks any more than
her voice and manner had and these things hard to describe but very
plain to see and feel made her a genial comfortable kind of person
easy to get on with and generally jolly as boys would say She saw
the little tremble of Nats lips as she smoothed his hair and her keen
eyes grew softer but she only drew the shabby figure nearer and said
laughing

I am Mother Bhaer that gentleman is Father Bhaer and these are the
two little Bhaers Come here boys and see Nat

The three wrestlers obeyed at once and the stout man with a chubby
child on each shoulder came up to welcome the new boy Rob and Teddy
merely grinned at him but Mr Bhaer shook hands and pointing to a low
chair near the fire said in a cordial voice

There is a place all ready for thee my son sit down and dry thy wet
feet at once

Wet So they are My dear off with your shoes this minute and Ill
have some dry things ready for you in a jiffy cried Mrs Bhaer
bustling about so energetically that Nat found himself in the cosy
little chair with dry socks and warm slippers on his feet before he
would have had time to say Jack Robinson if he had wanted to try He
said Thank you maam instead and said it so gratefully that Mrs
Bhaers eyes grew soft again and she said something merry because she
felt so tender which was a way she had

There are Tommy Bangs slippers but he never will remember to put them
on in the house so he shall not have them They are too big but thats
all the better you cant run away from us so fast as if they fitted

I dont want to run away maam And Nat spread his grimy little hands
before the comfortable blaze with a long sigh of satisfaction

Thats good Now I am going to toast you well and try to get rid of
that ugly cough How long have you had it dear asked Mrs Bhaer as
she rummaged in her big basket for a strip of flannel

All winter I got cold and it wouldnt get better somehow

No wonder living in that damp cellar with hardly a rag to his poor
dear back said Mrs Bhaer in a low tone to her husband who was
looking at the boy with a skillful pair of eyes that marked the thin
temples and feverish lips as well as the hoarse voice and frequent fits
of coughing that shook the bent shoulders under the patched jacket

Robin my man trot up to Nursey and tell her to give thee the
coughbottle and the liniment said Mr Bhaer after his eyes had
exchanged telegrams with his wifes

Nat looked a little anxious at the preparations but forgot his fears in
a hearty laugh when Mrs Bhaer whispered to him with a droll look

Hear my rogue Teddy try to cough The syrup Im going to give you has
honey in it and he wants some

Little Ted was red in the face with his exertions by the time the bottle
came and was allowed to suck the spoon after Nat had manfully taken a
dose and had the bit of flannel put about his throat

These first steps toward a cure were hardly completed when a great bell
rang and a loud tramping through the hall announced supper Bashful Nat
quaked at the thought of meeting many strange boys but Mrs Bhaer held
out her hand to him and Rob said patronizingly Dont be fraid Ill
take care of you

Twelve boys six on a side stood behind their chairs prancing with
impatience to begin while the tall fluteplaying youth was trying to
curb their ardor But no one sat down till Mrs Bhaer was in her place
behind the teapot with Teddy on her left and Nat on her right

This is our new boy Nat Blake After supper you can say how do you do
Gently boys gently

As she spoke every one stared at Nat and then whisked into their seats
trying to be orderly and failing utterly The Bhaers did their best to
have the lads behave well at meal times and generally succeeded pretty
well for their rules were few and sensible and the boys knowing that
they tried to make things easy and happy did their best to obey
But there are times when hungry boys cannot be repressed without real
cruelty and Saturday evening after a halfholiday was one of those
times

Dear little souls do let them have one day in which they can howl and
racket and frolic to their hearts content A holiday isnt a holiday
without plenty of freedom and fun and they shall have full swing once
a week Mrs Bhaer used to say when prim people wondered why
banistersliding pillowfights and all manner of jovial games were
allowed under the once decorous roof of Plumfield

It did seem at times as if the aforesaid roof was in danger of flying
off but it never did for a word from Father Bhaer could at any time
produce a lull and the lads had learned that liberty must not be
abused So in spite of many dark predictions the school flourished
and manners and morals were insinuated without the pupils exactly
knowing how it was done

Nat found himself very well off behind the tall pitchers with Tommy
Bangs just around the corner and Mrs Bhaer close by to fill up plate
and mug as fast as he could empty them

Who is that boy next the girl down at the other end whispered Nat to
his young neighbor under cover of a general laugh

Thats Demi Brooke Mr Bhaer is his uncle

What a queer name

His real name is John but they call him DemiJohn because his
father is John too Thats a joke dont you see said Tommy kindly
explaining Nat did not see but politely smiled and asked with
interest

Isnt he a very nice boy

I bet you he is knows lots and reads like any thing

Who is the fat one next him

Oh thats Stuffy Cole His name is George but we call him Stuffy
cause he eats so much The little fellow next Father Bhaer is his boy
Rob and then theres big Franz his nephew he teaches some and kind of
sees to us

He plays the flute doesnt he asked Nat as Tommy rendered himself
speechless by putting a whole baked apple into his mouth at one blow

Tommy nodded and said sooner than one would have imagined possible
under the circumstances Oh dont he though And we dance sometimes
and do gymnastics to music I like a drum myself and mean to learn as
soon as ever I can

I like a fiddle best I can play one too said Nat getting
confidential on this attractive subject

Can you and Tommy stared over the rim of his mug with round eyes
full of interest Mr Bhaers got an old fiddle and hell let you play
on it if you want to

Could I Oh I would like it ever so much You see I used to go round
fiddling with my father and another man till he died

Wasnt that fun cried Tommy much impressed

No it was horrid so cold in winter and hot in summer And I got
tired and they were cross sometimes and I didnt get enough to eat
Nat paused to take a generous bite of gingerbread as if to assure
himself that the hard times were over and then he added regretfully
But I did love my little fiddle and I miss it Nicolo took it away
when father died and wouldnt have me any longer cause I was sick

Youll belong to the band if you play good See if you dont

Do you have a band here Nats eyes sparkled

Guess we do a jolly band all boys and they have concerts and things
You just see what happens tomorrow night

After this pleasantly exciting remark Tommy returned to his supper and
Nat sank into a blissful reverie over his full plate

Mrs Bhaer had heard all they said while apparently absorbed in filling
mugs and overseeing little Ted who was so sleepy that he put his spoon
in his eye nodded like a rosy poppy and finally fell fast asleep with
his cheek pillowed on a soft bun Mrs Bhaer had put Nat next to Tommy
because that rolypoly boy had a frank and social way with him very
attractive to shy persons Nat felt this and had made several small
confidences during supper which gave Mrs Bhaer the key to the new
boys character better than if she had talked to him herself

In the letter which Mr Laurence had sent with Nat he had said

DEAR JO Here is a case after your own heart This poor lad is an
orphan now sick and friendless He has been a streetmusician and
I found him in a cellar mourning for his dead father and his lost
violin I think there is something in him and have a fancy that between
us we may give this little man a lift You cure his overtasked body
Fritz help his neglected mind and when he is ready Ill see if he is
a genius or only a boy with a talent which may earn his bread for him
Give him a trial for the sake of your own boy

TEDDY

Of course we will cried Mrs Bhaer as she read the letter and when
she saw Nat she felt at once that whether he was a genius or not here
was a lonely sick boy who needed just what she loved to give a home
and motherly care Both she and Mr Bhaer observed him quietly and in
spite of ragged clothes awkward manners and a dirty face they saw
much about Nat that pleased them He was a thin pale boy of twelve
with blue eyes and a good forehead under the rough neglected hair an
anxious scared face at times as if he expected hard words or blows
and a sensitive mouth that trembled when a kind glance fell on him
while a gentle speech called up a look of gratitude very sweet to see
Bless the poor dear he shall fiddle all day long if he likes said
Mrs Bhaer to herself as she saw the eager happy expression on his
face when Tommy talked of the band

So after supper when the lads flocked into the schoolroom for more
high jinks Mrs Jo appeared with a violin in her hand and after a
word with her husband went to Nat who sat in a corner watching the
scene with intense interest

Now my lad give us a little tune We want a violin in our band and I
think you will do it nicely

She expected that he would hesitate but he seized the old fiddle at
once and handled it with such loving care it was plain to see that
music was his passion

Ill do the best I can maam was all he said and then drew the bow
across the strings as if eager to hear the dear notes again

There was a great clatter in the room but as if deaf to any sounds but
those he made Nat played softly to himself forgetting every thing in
his delight It was only a simple Negro melody such as streetmusicians
play but it caught the ears of the boys at once and silenced them
till they stood listening with surprise and pleasure Gradually they got
nearer and nearer and Mr Bhaer came up to watch the boy for as if he
was in his element now Nat played away and never minded any one while
his eyes shone his cheeks reddened and his thin fingers flew as he
hugged the old fiddle and made it speak to all their hearts the language
that he loved

A hearty round of applause rewarded him better than a shower of pennies
when he stopped and glanced about him as if to say

Ive done my best please like it

I say you do that first rate cried Tommy who considered Nat his
protege

You shall be the first fiddle in my band added Franz with an
approving smile

Mrs Bhaer whispered to her husband

Teddy is right theres something in the child And Mr Bhaer nodded
his head emphatically as he clapped Nat on the shoulder saying
heartily

You play well my son Come now and play something which we can sing

It was the proudest happiest minute of the poor boys life when he was
led to the place of honor by the piano and the lads gathered round
never heeding his poor clothes but eying him respectfully and waiting
eagerly to hear him play again

They chose a song he knew and after one or two false starts they got
going and violin flute and piano led a chorus of boyish voices that
made the old roof ring again It was too much for Nat more feeble than
he knew and as the final shout died away his face began to work he
dropped the fiddle and turning to the wall sobbed like a little child

My dear what is it asked Mrs Bhaer who had been singing with all
her might and trying to keep little Rob from beating time with his
boots

You are all so kind and its so beautiful I cant help it sobbed Nat
coughing till he was breathless

Come with me dear you must go to bed and rest you are worn out and
this is too noisy a place for you whispered Mrs Bhaer and took him
away to her own parlor where she let him cry himself quiet

Then she won him to tell her all his troubles and listened to the
little story with tears in her own eyes though it was not a new one to
her

My child you have got a father and a mother now and this is home
Dont think of those sad times any more but get well and happy and be
sure you shall never suffer again if we can help it This place is made
for all sorts of boys to have a good time in and to learn how to help
themselves and be useful men I hope You shall have as much music as
you want only you must get strong first Now come up to Nursey and have
a bath and then go to bed and tomorrow we will lay some nice little
plans together

Nat held her hand fast in his but had not a word to say and let his
grateful eyes speak for him as Mrs Bhaer led him up to a big room
where they found a stout German woman with a face so round and cheery
that it looked like a sort of sun with the wide frill of her cap for
rays

This is Nursey Hummel and she will give you a nice bath and cut your
hair and make you all comfy as Rob says Thats the bathroom in
there and on Saturday nights we scrub all the little lads first and
pack them away in bed before the big ones get through singing Now then
Rob in with you

As she talked Mrs Bhaer had whipped off Robs clothes and popped him
into a long bathtub in the little room opening into the nursery

There were two tubs besides footbaths basins douchepipes and all
manner of contrivances for cleanliness Nat was soon luxuriating in the
other bath and while simmering there he watched the performances of
the two women who scrubbed clean nightgowned and bundled into bed
four or five small boys who of course cut up all sorts of capers
during the operation and kept every one in a gale of merriment till
they were extinguished in their beds

By the time Nat was washed and done up in a blanket by the fire while
Nursey cut his hair a new detachment of boys arrived and were shut into
the bathroom where they made as much splashing and noise as a school
of young whales at play

Nat had better sleep here so that if his cough troubles him in the
night you can see that he takes a good draught of flaxseed tea said
Mrs Bhaer who was flying about like a distracted hen with a large
brood of lively ducklings

Nursey approved the plan finished Nat off with a flannel nightgown a
drink of something warm and sweet and then tucked him into one of the
three little beds standing in the room where he lay looking like a
contented mummy and feeling that nothing more in the way of luxury
could be offered him Cleanliness in itself was a new and delightful
sensation flannel gowns were unknown comforts in his world sips of
good stuff soothed his cough as pleasantly as kind words did his
lonely heart and the feeling that somebody cared for him made that
plain room seem a sort of heaven to the homeless child It was like a
cosy dream and he often shut his eyes to see if it would not vanish
when he opened them again It was too pleasant to let him sleep and he
could not have done so if he had tried for in a few minutes one of the
peculiar institutions of Plumfield was revealed to his astonished but
appreciative eyes

A momentary lull in the aquatic exercises was followed by the sudden
appearance of pillows flying in all directions hurled by white goblins
who came rioting out of their beds The battle raged in several rooms
all down the upper hall and even surged at intervals into the nursery
when some hardpressed warrior took refuge there No one seemed to
mind this explosion in the least no one forbade it or even looked
surprised Nursey went on hanging up towels and Mrs Bhaer laid out
clean clothes as calmly as if the most perfect order reigned Nay
she even chased one daring boy out of the room and fired after him the
pillow he had slyly thrown at her

Wont they hurt em asked Nat who lay laughing with all his might

Oh dear no We always allow one pillowfight Saturday night The cases
are changed tomorrow and it gets up a glow after the boys baths so
I rather like it myself said Mrs Bhaer busy again among her dozen
pairs of socks

What a very nice school this is observed Nat in a burst of
admiration

Its an odd one laughed Mrs Bhaer but you see we dont believe
in making children miserable by too many rules and too much study I
forbade nightgown parties at first but bless you it was of no use
I could no more keep those boys in their beds than so many jacks in the
box So I made an agreement with them I was to allow a fifteenminute
pillowfight every Saturday night and they promised to go properly to
bed every other night I tried it and it worked well If they dont
keep their word no frolic if they do I just turn the glasses round
put the lamps in safe places and let them rampage as much as they
like

Its a beautiful plan said Nat feeling that he should like to join
in the fray but not venturing to propose it the first night So he lay
enjoying the spectacle which certainly was a lively one

Tommy Bangs led the assailing party and Demi defended his own room with
a dogged courage fine to see collecting pillows behind him as fast as
they were thrown till the besiegers were out of ammunition when they
would charge upon him in a body and recover their arms A few slight
accidents occurred but nobody minded and gave and took sounding
thwacks with perfect good humor while pillows flew like big snowflakes
till Mrs Bhaer looked at her watch and called out

Time is up boys Into bed every man jack or pay the forfeit

What is the forfeit asked Nat sitting up in his eagerness to know
what happened to those wretches who disobeyed this most peculiar but
publicspirited schoolmaam

Lose their fun next time answered Mrs Bhaer I give them five
minutes to settle down then put out the lights and expect order They
are honorable lads and they keep their word

That was evident for the battle ended as abruptly as it began a parting
shot or two a final cheer as Demi fired the seventh pillow at the
retiring foe a few challenges for next time then order prevailed And
nothing but an occasional giggle or a suppressed whisper broke the quiet
which followed the Saturdaynight frolic as Mother Bhaer kissed her new
boy and left him to happy dreams of life at Plumfield



CHAPTER II THE BOYS

While Nat takes a good long sleep I will tell my little readers
something about the boys among whom he found himself when he woke up

To begin with our old friends Franz was a tall lad of sixteen now a
regular German big blond and bookish also very domestic amiable
and musical His uncle was fitting him for college and his aunt for a
happy home of his own hereafter because she carefully fostered in him
gentle manners love of children respect for women old and young
and helpful ways about the house He was her righthand man on all
occasions steady kind and patient and he loved his merry aunt like a
mother for such she had tried to be to him

Emil was quite different being quicktempered restless and
enterprising bent on going to sea for the blood of the old vikings
stirred in his veins and could not be tamed His uncle promised that he
should go when he was sixteen and set him to studying navigation gave
him stories of good and famous admirals and heroes to read and let him
lead the life of a frog in river pond and brook when lessons were
done His room looked like the cabin of a manofwar for every thing
was nautical military and shipshape Captain Kyd was his delight and
his favorite amusement was to rig up like that piratical gentleman and
roar out sanguinary seasongs at the top of his voice He would dance
nothing but sailors hornpipes rolled in his gait and was as
nautical in conversation to his uncle would permit The boys called him
Commodore and took great pride in his fleet which whitened the
pond and suffered disasters that would have daunted any commander but a
seastruck boy

Demi was one of the children who show plainly the effect of intelligent
love and care for soul and body worked harmoniously together The
natural refinement which nothing but home influence can teach gave
him sweet and simple manners his mother had cherished an innocent and
loving heart in him his father had watched over the physical growth of
his boy and kept the little body straight and strong on wholesome food
and exercise and sleep while Grandpa March cultivated the little mind
with the tender wisdom of a modern Pythagoras not tasking it with long
hard lessons parrotlearned but helping it to unfold as naturally and
beautifully as sun and dew help roses bloom He was not a perfect child
by any means but his faults were of the better sort and being early
taught the secret of selfcontrol he was not left at the mercy of
appetites and passions as some poor little mortals are and then
punished for yielding to the temptations against which they have
no armor A quiet quaint boy was Demi serious yet cheery quite
unconscious that he was unusually bright and beautiful yet quick to see
and love intelligence or beauty in other children Very fond of books
and full of lively fancies born of a strong imagination and a spiritual
nature these traits made his parents anxious to balance them with
useful knowledge and healthful society lest they should make him one of
those pale precocious children who amaze and delight a family sometimes
and fade away like hothouse flowers because the young soul blooms too
soon and has not a hearty body to root it firmly in the wholesome soil
of this world

So Demi was transplanted to Plumfield and took so kindly to the life
there that Meg and John and Grandpa felt satisfied that they had done
well Mixing with other boys brought out the practical side of him
roused his spirit and brushed away the pretty cobwebs he was so fond of
spinning in that little brain of his To be sure he rather shocked
his mother when he came home by banging doors saying by George
emphatically and demanding tall thick boots that clumped like papas
But John rejoiced over him laughed at his explosive remarks got the
boots and said contentedly

He is doing well so let him clump I want my son to be a manly boy
and this temporary roughness wont hurt him We can polish him up by
and by and as for learning he will pick that up as pigeons do peas So
dont hurry him

Daisy was as sunshiny and charming as ever with all sorts of
womanlinesses budding in her for she was like her gentle mother
and delighted in domestic things She had a family of dolls whom she
brought up in the most exemplary manner she could not get on without
her little workbasket and bits of sewing which she did so nicely that
Demi frequently pulled out his handkerchief to display her neat stitches
and Baby Josy had a flannel petticoat beautifully made by Sister Daisy
She like to quiddle about the chinacloset prepare the saltcellars
put the spoons straight on the table and every day went round the
parlor with her brush dusting chairs and tables Demi called her a
Betty but was very glad to have her keep his things in order lend
him her nimble fingers in all sorts of work and help him with his
lessons for they kept abreast there and had no thought of rivalry

The love between them was as strong as ever and no one could laugh
Demi out of his affectionate ways with Daisy He fought her battles
valiantly and never could understand why boys should be ashamed to
say right out that they loved their sisters Daisy adored her twin
thought my brother the most remarkable boy in the world and every
morning in her little wrapper trotted to tap at his door with a
motherly Get up my dear its most breakfast time and heres your
clean collar

Rob was an energetic morsel of a boy who seemed to have discovered the
secret of perpetual motion for he never was still Fortunately he was
not mischievous nor very brave so he kept out of trouble pretty well
and vibrated between father and mother like an affectionate little
pendulum with a lively tick for Rob was a chatterbox

Teddy was too young to play a very important part in the affairs of
Plumfield yet he had his little sphere and filled it beautifully
Every one felt the need of a pet at times and Baby was always ready to
accommodate for kissing and cuddling suited him excellently Mrs
Jo seldom stirred without him so he had his little finger in all the
domestic pies and every one found them all the better for it for they
believed in babies at Plumfield

Dick Brown and Adolphus or Dolly Pettingill were two eight yearolds
Dolly stuttered badly but was gradually getting over it for no one was
allowed to mock him and Mr Bhaer tried to cure it by making him talk
slowly Dolly was a good little lad quite uninteresting and ordinary
but he flourished here and went through his daily duties and pleasures
with placid content and propriety

Dick Browns affliction was a crooked back yet he bore his burden so
cheerfully that Demi once asked in his queer way Do humps make people
goodnatured Id like one if they do Dick was always merry and did
his best to be like other boys for a plucky spirit lived in the
feeble little body When he first came he was very sensitive about his
misfortune but soon learned to forget it for no one dared remind him
of it after Mr Bhaer had punished one boy for laughing at him

God dont care for my soul is straight if my back isnt sobbed Dick
to his tormentor on that occasion and by cherishing this idea the
Bhaers soon led him to believe that people also loved his soul and did
not mind his body except to pity and help him to bear it

Playing menagerie once with the others some one said

What animal will you be Dick

Oh Im the dromedary dont you see the hump on my back was the
laughing answer

So you are my nice little one that dont carry loads but marches by
the elephant first in the procession said Demi who was arranging the
spectacle

I hope others will be as kind to the poor dear as my boys have learned
to be said Mrs Jo quite satisfied with the success of her teaching
as Dick ambled past her looking like a very happy but a very feeble
little dromedary beside stout Stuffy who did the elephant with
ponderous propriety

Jack Ford was a sharp rather a sly lad who was sent to this school
because it was cheap Many men would have thought him a smart boy but
Mr Bhaer did not like his way of illustrating that Yankee word and
thought his unboyish keenness and moneyloving as much of an affliction
as Dollys stutter or Dicks hump

Ned Barker was like a thousand other boys of fourteen all legs
blunder and bluster Indeed the family called him the Blunderbuss
and always expected to see him tumble over the chairs bump against the
tables and knock down any small articles near him He bragged a good
deal about what he could do but seldom did any thing to prove it was
not brave and a little given to taletelling He was apt to bully the
small boys and flatter the big ones and without being at all bad was
just the sort of fellow who could very easily be led astray

George Cole had been spoilt by an overindulgent mother who stuffed him
with sweetmeats till he was sick and then thought him too delicate
to study so that at twelve years old he was a pale puffy boy dull
fretful and lazy A friend persuaded her to send him to Plumfield and
there he soon got waked up for sweet things were seldom allowed much
exercise required and study made so pleasant that Stuffy was gently
lured along till he quite amazed his anxious mamma by his improvement
and convinced her that there was really something remarkable in
Plumfield air

Billy Ward was what the Scotch tenderly call an innocent for though
thirteen years old he was like a child of six He had been an unusually
intelligent boy and his father had hurried him on too fast giving him
all sorts of hard lessons keeping at his books six hours a day and
expecting him to absorb knowledge as a Strasburg goose does the food
crammed down its throat He thought he was doing his duty but he nearly
killed the boy for a fever gave the poor child a sad holiday and when
he recovered the overtasked brain gave out and Billys mind was like a
slate over which a sponge has passed leaving it blank

It was a terrible lesson to his ambitious father he could not bear the
sight of his promising child changed to a feeble idiot and he sent
him away to Plumfield scarcely hoping that he could be helped but sure
that he would be kindly treated Quite docile and harmless was Billy
and it was pitiful to see how hard he tried to learn as if groping
dimly after the lost knowledge which had cost him so much

Day after day he pored over the alphabet proudly said A and B and
thought that he knew them but on the morrow they were gone and all
the work was to be done over again Mr Bhaer had infinite patience with
him and kept on in spite of the apparent hopelessness of the task not
caring for book lessons but trying gently to clear away the mists from
the darkened mind and give it back intelligence enough to make the boy
less a burden and an affliction

Mrs Bhaer strengthened his health by every aid she could invent and
the boys all pitied and were kind to him He did not like their active
plays but would sit for hours watching the doves would dig holes for
Teddy till even that ardent grubber was satisfied or follow Silas the
man from place to place seeing him work for honest Si was very good to
him and though he forgot his letters Billy remembered friendly faces

Tommy Bangs was the scapegrace of the school and the most trying
scapegrace that ever lived As full of mischief as a monkey yet
so goodhearted that one could not help forgiving his tricks so
scatterbrained that words went by him like the wind yet so penitent
for every misdeed that it was impossible to keep sober when he
vowed tremendous vows of reformation or proposed all sorts of queer
punishments to be inflicted upon himself Mr and Mrs Bhaer lived in
a state of preparation for any mishap from the breaking of Tommys own
neck to the blowing up of the entire family with gunpowder and Nursey
had a particular drawer in which she kept bandages plasters and salves
for his especial use for Tommy was always being brought in half dead
but nothing ever killed him and he arose from every downfall with
redoubled vigor

The first day he came he chopped the top off one finger in the
haycutter and during the week fell from the shed roof was chased by
an angry hen who tried to pick his out because he examined her chickens
got run away with and had his ears boxed violent by Asia who caught
him luxuriously skimming a pan of cream with half a stolen pie
Undaunted however by any failures or rebuffs this indomitable youth
went on amusing himself with all sorts of tricks till no one felt safe
If he did not know his lessons he always had some droll excuse to
offer and as he was usually clever at his books and as bright as a
button in composing answers when he did not know them he go on pretty
well at school But out of school Ye gods and little fishes how Tommy
did carouse

He wound fat Asia up in her own clothes line against the post and left
here there to fume and scold for half an hour one busy Monday morning
He dropped a hot cent down Mary Anns back as that pretty maid was
waiting at table one day when there were gentlemen to dinner whereat
the poor girl upset the soup and rushed out of the room in dismay
leaving the family to think that she had gone mad He fixed a pail of
water up in a tree with a bit of ribbon fastened to the handle and
when Daisy attracted by the gay streamer tried to pull it down she
got a douche bath that spoiled her clean frock and hurt her little
feelings very much He put rough white pebbles in the sugarbowl when
his grandmother came to tea and the poor old lady wondered why they
didnt melt in her cup but was too polite to say anything He passed
around snuff in church so that five of the boys sneezed with such
violence they had to go out He dug paths in winter time and then
privately watered them so that people should tumble down He drove poor
Silas nearly wild by hanging his big boots in conspicuous places
for his feet were enormous and he was very much ashamed of them He
persuaded confiding little Dolly to tie a thread to one of his loose
teeth and leave the string hanging from his mouth when he went to
sleep so that Tommy could pull it out without his feeling the dreaded
operation But the tooth wouldnt come at the first tweak and poor
Dolly woke up in great anguish of spirit and lost all faith in Tommy
from that day forth

The last prank had been to give the hens bread soaked in rum which made
them tipsy and scandalized all the other fowls for the respectable old
biddies went staggering about pecking and clucking in the most maudlin
manner while the family were convulsed with laughter at their antics
till Daisy took pity on them and shut them up in the henhouse to sleep
off their intoxication

These were the boys and they lived together as happy as twelve lads
could studying and playing working and squabbling fighting faults and
cultivating virtues in the good oldfashioned way Boys at other schools
probably learned more from books but less of that better wisdom which
makes good men Latin Greek and mathematics were all very well but in
Professor Bhaers opinion self knowledge selfhelp and selfcontrol
were more important and he tried to teach them carefully People shook
their heads sometimes at his ideas even while they owned that the boys
improved wonderfully in manners and morals But then as Mrs Jo said to
Nat it was an odd school



CHAPTER III SUNDAY

The moment the bell rang next morning Nat flew out of bed and dressed
himself with great satisfaction in the suit of clothes he found on
the chair They were not new being halfworn garments of one of the
welltodo boys but Mrs Bhaer kept all such castoff feathers for the
picked robins who strayed into her nest They were hardly on when Tommy
appeared in a high state of clean collar and escorted Nat down to
breakfast

The sun was shining into the diningroom on the wellspread table and
the flock of hungry hearty lads who gathered round it Nat observed
that they were much more orderly than they had been the night before
and every one stood silently behind his chair while little Rob standing
beside his father at the head of the table folded his hands reverently
bent his curly head and softly repeated a short grace in the devout
German fashion which Mr Bhaer loved and taught his little son to
honor Then they all sat down to enjoy the Sundaymorning breakfast of
coffee steak and baked potatoes instead of the bread and milk fare
with which they usually satisfied their young appetites There was much
pleasant talk while the knives and forks rattled briskly for certain
Sunday lessons were to be learned the Sunday walk settled and plans
for the week discussed As he listened Nat thought it seemed as if this
day must be a very pleasant one for he loved quiet and there was
a cheerful sort of hush over every thing that pleased him very much
because in spite of his rough life the boy possessed the sensitive
nerves which belong to a musicloving nature

Now my lads get your morning jobs done and let me find you ready
for church when the bus comes round said Father Bhaer and set the
example by going into the schoolroom to get books ready for the morrow

Every one scattered to his or her task for each had some little daily
duty and was expected to perform it faithfully Some brought wood and
water brushed the steps or ran errands for Mrs Bhaer Others fed the
pet animals and did chores about the barn with Franz Daisy washed the
cups and Demi wiped them for the twins liked to work together and
Demi had been taught to make himself useful in the little house at home
Even Baby Teddy had his small job to do and trotted to and fro putting
napkins away and pushing chairs into their places For half and hour
the lads buzzed about like a hive of bees then the bus drove round
Father Bhaer and Franz with the eight older boys piled in and away they
went for a threemile drive to church in town

Because of the troublesome cough Nat prefered to stay at home with
the four small boys and spent a happy morning in Mrs Bhaers room
listening to the stories she read them learning the hymns she taught
them and then quietly employing himself pasting pictures into an old
ledger

This is my Sunday closet she said showing him shelves filled with
picturebooks paintboxes architectural blocks little diaries and
materials for letterwriting I want my boys to love Sunday to find it
a peaceful pleasant day when they can rest from common study and
play yet enjoy quiet pleasures and learn in simple ways lessons more
important than any taught in school Do you understand me she asked
watching Nats attentive face

You mean to be good he said after hesitating a minute

Yes to be good and to love to be good It is hard work sometimes I
know very well but we all help one another and so we get on This is
one of the ways in which I try to help my boys and she took down a
thick book which seemed halffull of writing and opened at a page on
which there was one word at the top

Why thats my name cried Nat looking both surprised and interested

Yes I have a page for each boy I keep a little account of how he gets
on through the week and Sunday night I show him the record If it is
bad I am sorry and disappointed if it is good I am glad and proud but
whichever it is the boys know I want to help them and they try to do
their best for love of me and Father Bhaer

I should think they would said Nat catching a glimpse of Tommys
name opposite his own and wondering what was written under it

Mrs Bhaer saw his eye on the words and shook her head saying as she
turned a leaf

No I dont show my records to any but the one to whom each belongs I
call this my conscience book and only you and I will ever know what is
to be written on the page below your name Whether you will be pleased
or ashamed to read it next Sunday depends on yourself I think it will
be a good report at any rate I shall try to make things easy for you
in this new place and shall be quite contented if you keep our few
rules live happily with the boys and learn something

Ill try maam and Nats thin face flushed up with the earnestness
of his desire to make Mrs Bhaer glad and proud not sorry and
disappointed It must be a great deal of trouble to write about so
many he added as she shut her book with an encouraging pat on the
shoulder

Not to me for I really dont know which I like best writing or boys
she said laughing to see Nat stare with astonishment at the last item
Yes I know many people think boys are a nuisance but that is because
they dont understand them I do and I never saw the boy yet whom I
could not get on capitally with after I had once found the soft spot in
his heart Bless me I couldnt get on at all without my flock of dear
noisy naughty harumscarum little lads could I my Teddy and Mrs
Bhaer hugged the young rogue just in time to save the big inkstand from
going into his pocket

Nat who had never heard anything like this before really did not know
whether Mother Bhaer was a trifle crazy or the most delightful woman he
had ever met He rather inclined to the latter opinion in spite of her
peculiar tastes for she had a way of filling up a fellows plate before
he asked of laughing at his jokes gently tweaking him by the ear or
clapping him on the shoulder that Nat found very engaging

Now I think you would like to go into the schoolroom and practise
some of the hymns we are to sing tonight she said rightly guessing
the thing of all others that he wanted to do

Alone with the beloved violin and the musicbook propped up before him
in the sunny window while Spring beauty filled the world outside and
Sabbath silence reigned within Nat enjoyed an hour or two of genuine
happiness learning the sweet old tunes and forgetting the hard past in
the cheerful present

When the churchgoers came back and dinner was over every one read
wrote letters home said their Sunday lessons or talked quietly to one
another sitting here and there about the house At three oclock the
entire family turned out to walk for all the active young bodies must
have exercise and in these walks the active young minds were taught
to see and love the providence of God in the beautiful miracles which
Nature was working before their eyes Mr Bhaer always went with them
and in his simple fatherly way found for his flock Sermons in
stones books in the running brooks and good in everything

Mrs Bhaer with Daisy and her own two boys drove into town to pay the
weekly visit to Grandma which was busy Mother Bhaers one holiday and
greatest pleasure Nat was not strong enough for the long walk and
asked to stay at home with Tommy who kindly offered to do the honors
of Plumfield Youve seen the house so come out and have a look at
the garden and the barn and the menagerie said Tommy when they were
left alone with Asia to see that they didnt get into mischief
for though Tommy was one of the bestmeaning boys who ever adorned
knickerbockers accidents of the most direful nature were always
happening to him no one could exactly tell how

What is your menagerie asked Nat as they trotted along the drive
that encircled the house

We all have pets you see and we keep em in the cornbarn and call
it the menagerie Here you are Isnt my guineapig a beauty and Tommy
proudly presented one of the ugliest specimens of that pleasing animal
that Nat ever saw

I know a boy with a dozen of em and he said hed give me one only I
hadnt any place to keep it so I couldnt have it It was white with
black spots a regular rouser and maybe I could get it for you if youd
like it said Nat feeling it would be a delicate return for Tommys
attentions

Id like it ever so much and Ill give you this one and they can live
together if they dont fight Those white mice are Robs Franz gave
em to him The rabbits are Neds and the bantams outside are Stuffys
That box thing is Demis turtletank only he hasnt begun to get em
yet Last year he had sixtytwo whackers some of em He stamped one of
em with his name and the year and let it go and he says maybe he will
find it ever so long after and know it He read about a turtle being
found that had a mark on it that showed it must be hundreds of years
old Demis such a funny chap

What is in this box asked Nat stopping before a large deep one
halffull of earth

Oh thats Jack Fords wormshop He digs heaps of em and keeps em
here and when we want any to go afishing with we buy some of him It
saves lots of trouble only he charged too much for em Why last time
we traded I had to pay two cents a dozen and then got little ones
Jacks mean sometimes and I told him Id dig for myself if he didnt
lower his prices Now I own two hens those gray ones with top knots
firstrate ones they are too and I sell Mrs Bhaer the eggs but I
never ask her more than twentyfive cents a dozen never Id be ashamed
to do it cried Tommy with a glance of scorn at the wormshop

Who owns the dogs asked Nat much interested in these commercial
transactions and feeling that T Bangs was a man whom it would be a
privilege and a pleasure to patronize

The big dog is Emils His name is Christopher Columbus Mrs Bhaer
named him because she likes to say Christopher Columbus and no one
minds it if she means the dog answered Tommy in the tone of a
showman displaying his menagerie The white pup is Robs and the
yellow one is Teddys A man was going to drown them in our pond and
Pa Bhaer wouldnt let him They do well enough for the little chaps I
dont think much of em myself Their names are Castor and Pollux

Id like Toby the donkey best if I could have anything its so nice
to ride and hes so little and good said Nat remembering the weary
tramps he had taken on his own tired feet

Mr Laurie sent him out to Mrs Bhaer so she shouldnt carry Teddy
on her back when we go to walk Were all fond of Toby and hes a
firstrate donkey sir Those pigeons belong to the whole lot of us we
each have our pet one and go shares in all the little ones as they come
along Squabs are great fun there aint any now but you can go up and
take a look at the old fellows while I see if Cockletop and Granny have
laid any eggs

Nat climbed up a ladder put his head through a trap door and took a
long look at the pretty doves billing and cooing in their spacious loft
Some on their nests some bustling in and out and some sitting at
their doors while many went flying from the sunny housetop to the
strawstrewn farmyard where six sleek cows were placidly ruminating

Everybody has got something but me I wish I had a dove or a hen or
even a turtle all my own thought Nat feeling very poor as he saw the
interesting treasures of the other boys How do you get these things
he asked when he joined Tommy in the barn

We find em or buy em or folks give em to us My father sends me
mine but as soon as I get egg money enough Im going to buy a pair of
ducks Theres a nice little pond for em behind the barn and people
pay well for duckeggs and the little duckies are pretty and its fun
to see em swim said Tommy with the air of a millionaire

Nat sighed for he had neither father nor money nothing in the wide
world but an old empty pocketbook and the skill that lay in his ten
finger tips Tommy seemed to understand the question and the sigh which
followed his answer for after a moment of deep thought he suddenly
broke out

Look here Ill tell you what Ill do If you will hunt eggs for me I
hate it Ill give you one egg out of every dozen You keep account and
when youve had twelve Mother Bhaer will give you twentyfive cents for
em and then you can buy what you like dont you see

Ill do it What a kind feller you are Tommy cried Nat quite
dazzled by this brilliant offer

Pooh that is not anything You begin now and rummage the barn and
Ill wait here for you Granny is cackling so youre sure to find one
somewhere and Tommy threw himself down on the hay with a luxurious
sense of having made a good bargain and done a friendly thing

Nat joyfully began his search and went rustling from loft to loft till
he found two fine eggs one hidden under a beam and the other in an old
peck measure which Mrs Cockletop had appropriated

You may have one and Ill have the other that will just make up my
last dozen and tomorrow well start fresh Here you chalk your
accounts up near mine and then well be all straight said Tommy
showing a row of mysterious figures on the side of an old winnowing
machine

With a delightful sense of importance the proud possessor of one egg
opened his account with his friend who laughingly wrote above the
figures these imposing words

T Bangs  Co

Poor Nat found them so fascinating that he was with difficulty persuaded
to go and deposit his first piece of portable property in Asias
storeroom Then they went on again and having made the acquaintance
of the two horses six cows three pigs and one Alderney Bossy
as calves are called in New England Tommy took Nat to a certain old
willowtree that overhung a noisy little brook From the fence it was
an easy scramble into a wide niche between the three big branches which
had been cut off to send out from year to year a crowd of slender twigs
till a green canopy rustled overhead Here little seats had been fixed
and a hollow place a closet made big enough to hold a book or two a
dismantled boat and several halffinished whistles

This is Demis and my private place we made it and nobody can come up
unless we let em except Daisy we dont mind her said Tommy as Nat
looked with delight from the babbling brown water below to the green
arch above where bees were making a musical murmur as they feasted on
the long yellow blossoms that filled the air with sweetness

Oh its just beautiful cried Nat I do hope youll let me up
sometimes I never saw such a nice place in all my life Id like to be
a bird and live here always

It is pretty nice You can come if Demi dont mind and I guess he
wont because he said last night that he liked you

Did he and Nat smiled with pleasure for Demis regard seemed to be
valued by all the boys partly because he was Father Bhaers nephew and
partly because he was such a sober conscientious little fellow

Yes Demi likes quiet chaps and I guess he and you will get on if you
care about reading as he does

Poor Nats flush of pleasure deepened to a painful scarlet at those last
words and he stammered out

I cant read very well I never had any time I was always fiddling
round you know

I dont love it myself but I can do it well enough when I want to
said Tommy after a surprised look which said as plainly as words A
boy twelve years old and cant read

I can read music anyway added Nat rather ruffled at having to
confess his ignorance

I cant and Tommy spoke in a respectful tone which emboldened Nat to
say firmly

I mean to study real hard and learn every thing I can for I never had
a chance before Does Mr Bhaer give hard lessons

No he isnt a bit cross he sort of explains and gives you a boost
over the hard places Some folks dont my other master didnt If we
missed a word didnt we get raps on the head and Tommy rubbed his own
pate as if it tingled yet with the liberal supply of raps the memory
of which was the only thing he brought away after a year with his other
master

I think I could read this said Nat who had been examining the books

Read a bit then Ill help you resumed Tommy with a patronizing
air

So Nat did his best and floundered through a page with may friendly
boosts from Tommy who told him he would soon go it as well as
anybody Then they sat and talked boyfashion about all sorts of things
among others gardening for Nat looking down from his perch asked
what was planted in the many little patches lying below them on the
other side of the brook

These are our farms said Tommy We each have our own patch and
raise what we like in it only have to choose different things and
cant change till the crop is in and we must keep it in order all
summer

What are you going to raise this year

Wal I cattleated to hev beans as they are about the easiest crop
agoin

Nat could not help laughing for Tommy had pushed back his hat put his
hands in his pockets and drawled out his words in unconscious imitation
of Silas the man who managed the place for Mr Bhaer

Come you neednt laugh beans are ever so much easier than corn or
potatoes I tried melons last year but the bugs were a bother and the
old things wouldnt get ripe before the frost so I didnt have but one
good water and two little mush mellions said Tommy relapsing into a
Silasism with the last word

Corn looks pretty growing said Nat politely to atone for his laugh

Yes but you have to hoe it over and over again Now six weeks beans
only have to be done once or so and they get ripe soon Im going to
try em for I spoke first Stuffy wanted em but hes got to take
peas they only have to be picked and he ought to do it he eats such a
lot

I wonder if I shall have a garden said Nat thinking that even
cornhoeing must be pleasant work

Of course you will said a voice from below and there was Mr Bhaer
returned from his walk and come to find them for he managed to have
a little talk with every one of the lads some time during the day and
found that these chats gave them a good start for the coming week

Sympathy is a sweet thing and it worked wonders here for each boy knew
that Father Bhaer was interested in him and some were readier to open
their hearts to him than to a woman especially the older ones who
liked to talk over their hopes and plans man to man When sick or in
trouble they instinctively turned to Mrs Jo while the little ones made
her their motherconfessor on all occasions

In descending from their nest Tommy fell into the brook being used to
it he calmly picked himself out and retired to the house to be dried
This left Nat to Mr Bhaer which was just what he wished and during
the stroll they took among the garden plots he won the lads heart by
giving him a little farm and discussing crops with him as gravely as
if the food for the family depended on the harvest From this pleasant
topic they went to others and Nat had many new and helpful thoughts put
into a mind that received them as gratefully as the thirsty earth had
received the warm spring rain All supper time he brooded over them
often fixing his eyes on Mr Bhaer with an inquiring look that seemed
to say I like that do it again sir I dont know whether the man
understood the childs mute language or not but when the boys were all
gathered together in Mrs Bhaers parlor for the Sunday evening talk
he chose a subject which might have been suggested by the walk in the
garden

As he looked about him Nat thought it seemed more like a great family
than a school for the lads were sitting in a wide halfcircle round the
fire some on chairs some on the rug Daisy and Demi on the knees of
Uncle Fritz and Rob snugly stowed away in the back of his mothers
easychair where he could nod unseen if the talk got beyond his depth

Every one looked quite comfortable and listened attentively for the
long walk made rest agreeable and as every boy there knew that he would
be called upon for his views he kept his wits awake to be ready with an
answer

Once upon a time began Mr Bhaer in the dear oldfashioned way
there was a great and wise gardener who had the largest garden ever
seen A wonderful and lovely place it was and he watched over it with
the greatest skill and care and raised all manner of excellent and
useful things But weeds would grow even in this fine garden often the
ground was bad and the good seeds sown in it would not spring up He
had many under gardeners to help him Some did their duty and earned the
rich wages he gave them but others neglected their parts and let them
run to waste which displeased him very much But he was very patient
and for thousands and thousands of years he worked and waited for his
great harvest

He must have been pretty old said Demi who was looking straight into
Uncle Fritzs face as if to catch every word

Hush Demi its a fairy story whispered Daisy

No I think its an arrygory said Demi

What is a arrygory called out Tommy who was of an inquiring turn

Tell him Demi if you can and dont use words unless you are quite
sure you know what they mean said Mr Bhaer

I do know Grandpa told me A fable is a arrygory its a story that
means something My Story without an end is one because the child in
it means a soul dont it Aunty cried Demi eager to prove himself
right

Thats it dear and Uncles story is an allegory I am quite sure so
listen and see what it means returned Mrs Jo who always took part in
whatever was going on and enjoyed it as much as any boy among them

Demi composed himself and Mr Bhaer went on in his best English for he
had improved much in the last five years and said the boys did it

This great gardener gave a dozen or so of little plots to one of his
servants and told him to do his best and see what he could raise Now
this servant was not rich nor wise nor very good but he wanted to
help because the gardener had been very kind to him in many ways So he
gladly took the little plots and fell to work They were all sorts of
shapes and sizes and some were very good soil some rather stony and
all of them needed much care for in the rich soil the weeds grew fast
and in the poor soil there were many stones

What was growing in them besides the weeds and stones asked Nat so
interested he forgot his shyness and spoke before them all

Flowers said Mr Bhaer with a kind look Even the roughest most
neglected little bed had a bit of heartsease or a sprig of mignonette
in it One had roses sweet peas and daisies in it here he pinched
the plump cheek of the little girl leaning on his arm Another had all
sorts of curious plants in it bright pebbles a vine that went climbing
up like Jacks beanstalk and many good seeds just beginning to sprout
for you see this bed had been taken fine care of by a wise old man
who had worked in gardens of this sort all his life

At this part of the arrygory Demi put his head on one side like an
inquisitive bird and fixed his bright eye on his uncles face as if he
suspected something and was on the watch But Mr Bhaer looked perfectly
innocent and went on glancing from one young face to another with a
grave wistful look that said much to his wife who knew how earnestly
he desired to do his duty in these little garden plots

As I tell you some of these beds were easy to cultivate that means
to take care of Daisy and others were very hard There was one
particularly sunshiny little bed that might have been full of fruits and
vegetables as well as flowers only it wouldnt take any pains and when
the man sowed well well say melons in this bed they came to nothing
because the little bed neglected them The man was sorry and kept on
trying though every time the crop failed all the bed said was I
forgot

Here a general laugh broke out and every one looked at Tommy who had
pricked up his ears at the word melons and hung down his head at the
sound of his favorite excuse

I knew he meant us cried Demi clapping his hands You are the man
and we are the little gardens arent we Uncle Fritz

You have guessed it Now each of you tell me what crop I shall try to
sow in you this spring so that next autumn I may get a good harvest out
of my twelve no thirteen plots said Mr Bhaer nodding at Nat as he
corrected himself

You cant sow corn and beans and peas in us Unless you mean we are to
eat a great many and get fat said Stuffy with a sudden brightening of
his round dull face as the pleasing idea occurred to him

He dont mean that kind of seeds He means things to make us good and
the weeds are faults cried Demi who usually took the lead in these
talks because he was used to this sort of thing and liked it very
much

Yes each of you think what you need most and tell me and I will help
you to grow it only you must do your best or you will turn out like
Tommys melons all leaves and no fruit I will begin with the oldest
and ask the mother what she will have in her plot for we are all parts
of the beautiful garden and may have rich harvests for our Master if we
love Him enough said Father Bhaer

I shall devote the whole of my plot to the largest crop of patience I
can get for that is what I need most said Mrs Jo so soberly that
the lads fell to thinking in good earnest what they should say when
their turns came and some among them felt a twinge of remorse that
they had helped to use up Mother Bhaers stock of patience so fast

Franz wanted perseverance Tommy steadiness Ned went in for good
temper Daisy for industry Demi for as much wiseness as Grandpa and
Nat timidly said he wanted so many things he would let Mr Bhaer choose
for him The others chose much the same things and patience good
temper and generosity seemed the favorite crops One boy wished to like
to get up early but did not know what name to give that sort of seed
and poor Stuffy sighed out

I wish I loved my lessons as much as I do my dinner but I cant

We will plant selfdenial and hoe it and water it and make it grow so
well that next Christmas no one will get ill by eating too much dinner
If you exercise your mind George it will get hungry just as your body
does and you will love books almost as much as my philosopher here
said Mr Bhaer adding as he stroked the hair off Demis fine forehead
You are greedy also my son and you like to stuff your little mind
full of fairy tales and fancies as well as George likes to fill his
little stomach with cake and candy Both are bad and I want you to
try something better Arithmetic is not half so pleasant as Arabian
Nights I know but it is a very useful thing and now is the time to
learn it else you will be ashamed and sorry by and by

But Harry and Lucy and Frank are not fairy books and they
are all full of barometers and bricks and shoeing horses and useful
things and Im fond of them aint I Daisy said Demi anxious to
defend himself

So they are but I find you reading Roland and Maybird a great deal
oftener than Harry and Lucy and I think you are not half so fond of
Frank as you are of Sinbad Come I shall make a little bargain with
you both George shall eat but three times a day and you shall read but
one storybook a week and I will give you the new cricketground only
you must promise to play in it said Uncle Fritz in his persuasive
way for Stuffy hated to run about and Demi was always reading in play
hours

But we dont like cricket said Demi

Perhaps not now but you will when you know it Besides you do like to
be generous and the other boys want to play and you can give them the
new ground if you choose

This was taken them both on the right side and they agreed to the
bargain to the great satisfaction of the rest

There was a little more talk about the gardens and then they all sang
together The band delighted Nat for Mrs Bhaer played the piano Franz
the flute Mr Bhaer a bass viol and he himself the violin A very
simple little concert but all seemed to enjoy it and old Asia sitting
in the corner joined at times with the sweetest voice of any for in
this family master and servant old and young black and white shared
in the Sunday song which went up to the Father of them all After this
they each shook hands with Father Bhaer Mother Bhaer kissed them every
one from sixteenyearold Franz to little Rob how kept the tip of her
nose for his own particular kisses and then they trooped up to bed

The light of the shaded lamp that burned in the nursery shone softly on
a picture hanging at the foot of Nats bed There were several others
on the walls but the boy thought there must be something peculiar about
this one for it had a graceful frame of moss and cones about it and
on a little bracket underneath stood a vase of wild flowers freshly
gathered from the spring woods It was the most beautiful picture of
them all and Nat lay looking at it dimly feeling what it meant and
wishing he knew all about it

Thats my picture said a little voice in the room Nat popped up his
head and there was Demi in his nightgown pausing on his way back from
Aunt Jos chamber whither he had gone to get a cot for a cut finger

What is he doing to the children asked Nat

That is Christ the Good Man and He is blessing the children Dont
you know about Him said Demi wondering

Not much but Id like to He looks so kind answered Nat whose chief
knowledge of the Good Man consisted in hearing His name taken in vain

I know all about it and I like it very much because it is true said
Demi

Who told you

My Grandpa he knows every thing and tells the best stories in
the world I used to play with his big books and make bridges and
railroads and houses when I was a little boy began Demi

How old are you now asked Nat respectfully

Most ten

You know a lot of things dont you

Yes you see my head is pretty big and Grandpa says it will take a
good deal to fill it so I keep putting pieces of wisdom into it as fast
as I can returned Demi in his quaint way

Nat laughed and then said soberly

Tell on please

And Demi gladly told on without pause or punctuation I found a very
pretty book one day and wanted to play with it but Grandpa said I
mustnt and showed me the pictures and told me about them and I liked
the stories very much all about Joseph and his bad brothers and the
frogs that came up out of the sea and dear little Moses in the water
and ever so many more lovely ones but I liked about the Good Man best
of all and Grandpa told it to me so many times that I learned it by
heart and he gave me this picture so I shouldnt forget and it was
put up here once when I was sick and I left it for other sick boys to
see

What makes Him bless the children asked Nat who found something very
attractive in the chief figure of the group

Because He loved them

Were they poor children asked Nat wistfully

Yes I think so you see some havent got hardly any clothes on and
the mothers dont look like rich ladies He liked poor people and was
very good to them He made them well and helped them and told rich
people they must not be cross to them and they loved Him dearly
dearly cried Demi with enthusiasm

Was He rich

Oh no He was born in a barn and was so poor He hadnt any house to
live in when He grew up and nothing to eat sometimes but what people
gave Him and He went round preaching to everybody and trying to make
them good till the bad men killed Him

What for and Nat sat up in his bed to look and listen so interested
was he in this man who cared for the poor so much

Ill tell you all about it Aunt Jo wont mind and Demi settled
himself on the opposite bed glad to tell his favorite story to so good
a listener

Nursey peeped in to see if Nat was asleep but when she saw what was
going on she slipped away again and went to Mrs Bhaer saying with
her kind face full of motherly emotion

Will the dear lady come and see a pretty sight Its Nat listening
with all his heart to Demi telling the story of the Christchild like a
little white angel as he is

Mrs Bhaer had meant to go and talk with Nat a moment before he slept
for she had found that a serious word spoken at this time often did
much good But when she stole to the nursery door and saw Nat eagerly
drinking in the words of his little friends while Demi told the sweet
and solemn story as it had been taught him speaking softly as he sat
with his beautiful eyes fixed on the tender face above them her own
filled with tears and she went silently away thinking to herself

Demi is unconsciously helping the poor boy better than I can I will
not spoil it by a single word

The murmur of the childish voice went on for a long time as one
innocent heart preached that great sermon to another and no one hushed
it When it ceased at last and Mrs Bhaer went to take away the lamp
Demi was gone and Nat fast asleep lying with his face toward the
picture as if he had already learned to love the Good Man who loved
little children and was a faithful friend to the poor The boys face
was very placid and as she looked at it she felt that if a single day
of care and kindness had done so much a year of patient cultivation
would surely bring a grateful harvest from this neglected garden which
was already sown with the best of all seed by the little missionary in
the nightgown



CHAPTER IV STEPPINGSTONES

When Nat went into school on Monday morning he quaked inwardly for now
he thought he should have to display his ignorance before them all But
Mr Bhaer gave him a seat in the deep window where he could turn his
back on the others and Franz heard him say his lessons there so no one
could hear his blunders or see how he blotted his copybook He was truly
grateful for this and toiled away so diligently that Mr Bhaer said
smiling when he saw his hot face and inky fingers

Dont work so hard my boy you will tire yourself out and there is
time enough

But I must work hard or I cant catch up with the others They know
heaps and I dont know anything said Nat who had been reduced to a
state of despair by hearing the boys recite their grammar history and
geography with what he thought amazing ease and accuracy

You know a good many things which they dont said Mr Bhaer sitting
down beside him while Franz led a class of small students through the
intricacies of the multiplication table

Do I and Nat looked utterly incredulous

Yes for one thing you can keep your temper and Jack who is quick
at numbers cannot that is an excellent lesson and I think you have
learned it well Then you can play the violin and not one of the lads
can though they want to do it very much But best of all Nat you
really care to learn something and that is half the battle It seems
hard at first and you will feel discouraged but plod away and things
will get easier and easier as you go on

Nats face had brightened more and more as he listened for small as
the list of his learning was it cheered him immensely to feel that
he had anything to fall back upon Yes I can keep my temper fathers
beating taught me that and I can fiddle though I dont know where the
Bay of Biscay is he thought with a sense of comfort impossible to
express Then he said aloud and so earnestly that Demi heard him

I do want to learn and I will try I never went to school but I
couldnt help it and if the fellows dont laugh at me I guess Ill get
on first rate you and the lady are so good to me

They shant laugh at you if they do Ill Ill tell them not to
cried Demi quite forgetting where he was

The class stopped in the middle of 7 times 9 and everyone looked up to
see what was going on

Thinking that a lesson in learning to help one another was better than
arithmetic just then Mr Bhaer told them about Nat making such an
interesting and touching little story out of it that the goodhearted
lads all promised to lend him a hand and felt quite honored to be
called upon to impart their stores of wisdom to the chap who fiddled so
capitally This appeal established the right feeling among them and Nat
had few hindrances to struggle against for every one was glad to give
him a boost up the ladder of learning

Till he was stronger much study was not good for him however and Mrs
Jo found various amusements in the house for him while others were at
their books But his garden was his best medicine and he worked away
like a beaver preparing his little farm sowing his beans watching
eagerly to see them grow and rejoicing over each green leaf and slender
stock that shot up and flourished in the warm spring weather Never
was a garden more faithfully hoed Mr Bhaer really feared that nothing
would find time to grow Nat kept up such a stirring of the soil so he
gave him easy jobs in the flower garden or among the strawberries where
he worked and hummed as busily as the bees booming all about him

This is the crop I like best Mrs Bhaer used to say as she pinched
the once thin cheeks now getting plump and ruddy or stroked the bent
shoulders that were slowly straightening up with healthful work good
food and the absence of that heavy burden poverty

Demi was his little friend Tommy his patron and Daisy the comforter of
all his woes for though the children were younger than he his timid
spirit found a pleasure in their innocent society and rather shrunk
from the rough sports of the elder lads Mr Laurence did not forget
him but sent clothes and books music and kind messages and now and
then came out to see how his boy was getting on or took him into town
to a concert on which occasions Nat felt himself translated into the
seventh heaven of bliss for he went to Mr Laurences great house saw
his pretty wife and little fairy of a daughter had a good dinner and
was made so comfortable that he talked and dreamed of it for days and
nights afterward

It takes so little to make a child happy that it is a pity in a world
so full of sunshine and pleasant things that there should be any
wistful faces empty hands or lonely little hearts Feeling this the
Bhaers gathered up all the crumbs they could find to feed their flock of
hungry sparrows for they were not rich except in charity Many of
Mrs Jos friends who had nurseries sent her they toys of which their
children so soon tired and in mending these Nat found an employment
that just suited him He was very neat and skillful with those slender
fingers of his and passed many a rainy afternoon with his gumbottle
paintbox and knife repairing furniture animals and games while
Daisy was dressmaker to the dilapidated dolls As fast as the toys were
mended they were put carefully away in a certain drawer which was
to furnish forth a Christmastree for all the poor children of the
neighborhood that being the way the Plumfield boys celebrated the
birthday of Him who loved the poor and blessed the little ones

Demi was never tired of reading and explaining his favorite books and
many a pleasant hour did they spend in the old willow revelling over
Robinson Crusoe Arabian Nights Edgeworths Tales and the other
dear immortal stories that will delight children for centuries to come
This opened a new world to Nat and his eagerness to see what came next
in the story helped him on till he could read as well as anybody and
felt so rich and proud with his new accomplishment that there was
danger of his being as much of a bookworm as Demi

Another helpful thing happened in a most unexpected and agreeable
manner Several of the boys were in business as they called it for
most of them were poor and knowing that they would have their own way
to make by and by the Bhaers encouraged any efforts at independence
Tommy sold his eggs Jack speculated in live stock Franz helped in
the teaching and was paid for it Ned had a taste for carpentry and a
turninglathe was set up for him in which he turned all sorts of useful
or pretty things and sold them while Demi constructed watermills
whirligigs and unknown machines of an intricate and useless nature and
disposed of them to the boys

Let him be a mechanic if he likes said Mr Bhaer Give a boy a
trade and he is independent Work is wholesome and whatever talent
these lads possess be it for poetry or ploughing it shall be
cultivated and made useful to them if possible

So when Nat came running to him one day to ask with an excited face

Can I go and fiddle for some people who are to have a picnic in our
woods They will pay me and Id like to earn some money as the other
boys do and fiddling is the only way I know how to do it

Mr Bhaer answered readily

Go and welcome It is an easy and a pleasant way to work and I am
glad it is offered you

Nat went and did so well that when he came home he had two dollars in
his pocket which he displayed with intense satisfaction as he told how
much he had enjoyed the afternoon how kind the young people were and
how they had praised his dance music and promised to have him again

It is so much nicer than fiddling in the street for then I got none
of the money and now I have it all and a good time besides Im in
business now as well as Tommy and Jack and I like it ever so much
said Nat proudly patting the old pocketbook and feeling like a
millionaire already

He was in business truly for picnics were plenty as summer opened
and Nats skill was in great demand He was always at liberty to go if
lessons were not neglected and if the picnickers were respectable young
people For Mr Bhaer explained to him that a good plain education is
necessary for everyone and that no amount of money should hire him to
go where he might be tempted to do wrong Nat quite agreed to this and
it was a pleasant sight to see the innocenthearted lad go driving away
in the gay wagons that stopped at the gate for him or to hear him come
fiddling home tired but happy with his wellearned money in one pocket
and some goodies from the feast for Daisy or little Ted whom he never
forgot

Im going to save up till I get enough to buy a violin for myself and
then I can earn my own living cant I he used to say as he brought
his dollars to Mr Bhaer to keep

I hope so Nat but we must get you strong and hearty first and put a
little more knowledge into this musical head of yours Then Mr Laurie
will find you a place somewhere and in a few years we will all come to
hear you play in public

With much congenial work encouragement and hope Nat found life
getting easier and happier every day and made such progress in his
music lessons that his teacher forgave his slowness in some other
things knowing very well that where the heart is the mind works best
The only punishment the boy ever needed for neglect of more important
lessons was to hang up the fiddle and the bow for a day The fear of
losing his bosom friend entirely made him go at his books with a will
and having proved that he could master the lessons what was the use of
saying I cant

Daisy had a great love of music and a great reverence for any one who
could make it and she was often found sitting on the stairs outside
Nats door while he was practising This pleased him very much and he
played his best for that one quiet little listener for she never would
come in but preferred to sit sewing her gay patchwork or tending one
of her many dolls with an expression of dreamy pleasure on her face
that made Aunt Jo say with tears in her eyes So like my Beth and
go softly by lest even her familiar presence mar the childs sweet
satisfaction

Nat was very fond of Mrs Bhaer but found something even more
attractive in the good professor who took fatherly care of the shy
feeble boy who had barely escaped with his life from the rough sea on
which his little boat had been tossing rudderless for twelve years Some
good angel must have been watching over him for though his body had
suffered his soul seemed to have taken little harm and came ashore as
innocent as a shipwrecked baby Perhaps his love of music kept it sweet
in spite of the discord all about him Mr Laurie said so and he ought
to know However that might be Father Bhaer took pleasure in fostering
poor Nats virtues and in curing his faults finding his new pupil as
docile and affectionate as a girl He often called Nat his daughter
when speaking of him to Mrs Jo and she used to laugh at his fancy for
Madame liked manly boys and thought Nat amiable but weak though you
never would have guessed it for she petted him as she did Daisy and he
thought her a very delightful woman

One fault of Nats gave the Bhaers much anxiety although they saw how
it had been strengthened by fear and ignorance I regret to say that
Nat sometimes told lies Not very black ones seldom getting deeper than
gray and often the mildest of white fibs but that did not matter a
lie is a lie and though we all tell many polite untruths in this queer
world of ours it is not right and everybody knows it

You cannot be too careful watch your tongue and eyes and hands for
it is easy to tell and look and act untruth said Mr Bhaer in one
of the talks he had with Nat about his chief temptation

I know it and I dont mean to but its so much easier to get along
if you aint very fussy about being exactly true I used to tell em
because I was afraid of father and Nicolo and now I do sometimes
because the boys laugh at me I know its bad but I forget and Nat
looked much depressed by his sins

When I was a little lad I used to tell lies Ach what fibs they were
and my old grandmother cured me of it how do you think My parents had
talked and cried and punished but still did I forget as you Then
said the dear old grandmother I shall help you to remember and put a
check on this unruly part with that she drew out my tongue and snipped
the end with her scissors till the blood ran That was terrible you
may believe but it did me much good because it was sore for days and
every word I said came so slowly that I had time to think After that I
was more careful and got on better for I feared the big scissors Yet
the dear grandmother was most kind to me in all things and when she lay
dying far away in Nuremberg she prayed that little Fritz might love God
and tell the truth

I never had any grandmothers but if you think it will cure me Ill
let you snip my tongue said Nat heroically for he dreaded pain yet
did wish to stop fibbing

Mr Bhaer smiled but shook his head

I have a better way than that I tried it once before and it worked
well See now when you tell a lie I will not punish you but you shall
punish me

How asked Nat startled at the idea

You shall ferule me in the good oldfashioned way I seldom do it
myself but it may make you remember better to give me pain than to feel
it yourself

Strike you Oh I couldnt cried Nat

Then mind that tripping tongue of thine I have no wish to be hurt but
I would gladly bear much pain to cure this fault

This suggestion made such an impression on Nat that for a long time he
set a watch upon his lips and was desperately accurate for Mr Bhaer
judged rightly that love of him would be more powerful with Nat that
fear for himself But alas one sad day Nat was off his guard and when
peppery Emil threatened to thrash him if it was he who had run over his
garden and broken down his best hills of corn Nat declared he didnt
and then was ashamed to own up that he did do it when Jack was chasing
him the night before

He thought no one would find it out but Tommy happened to see him and
when Emil spoke of it a day or two later Tommy gave his evidence and
Mr Bhaer heard it School was over and they were all standing about in
the hall and Mr Bhaer had just set down on the straw settee to enjoy
his frolic with Teddy but when he heard Tommy and saw Nat turn scarlet
and look at him with a frightened face he put the little boy down
saying Go to thy mother bubchen I will come soon and taking Nat by
the hand led him into the school and shut the door

The boys looked at one another in silence for a minute then Tommy
slipped out and peeping in at the halfclosed blinds beheld a sight
that quite bewildered him Mr Bhaer had just taken down the long rule
that hung over his desk so seldom used that it was covered with dust

My eye Hes going to come down heavy on Nat this time Wish I hadnt
told thought goodnatured Tommy for to be feruled was the deepest
disgrace at this school

You remember what I told you last time said Mr Bhaer sorrowfully
not angrily

Yes but please dont make me I cant bear it cried Nat backing
up against the door with both hands behind him and a face full of
distress

Why dont he up and take it like a man I would thought Tommy though
his heart beat fast at the sight

I shall keep my word and you must remember to tell the truth Obey me
Nat take this and give me six good strokes

Tommy was so staggered by this last speech that he nearly tumbled down
the bank but saved himself and hung onto the window ledge staring in
with eyes as round as the stuffed owls on the chimneypiece

Nat took the rule for when Mr Bhaer spoke in that tone everyone obeyed
him and looking as scared and guilty as if about to stab his master
he gave two feeble blows on the broad hand held out to him Then
he stopped and looked up halfblind with tears but Mr Bhaer said
steadily

Go on and strike harder

As if seeing that it must be done and eager to have the hard task soon
over Nat drew his sleeve across his eyes and gave two more quick hard
strokes that reddened the hand yet hurt the giver more

Isnt that enough he asked in a breathless sort of tone

Two more was all the answer and he gave them hardly seeing where
they fell then threw the rule all across the room and hugging the kind
hand in both his own laid his face down on it sobbing out in a passion
of love and shame and penitence

I will remember Oh I will

Then Mr Bhaer put an arm about him and said in a tone as compassionate
as it had just now been firm

I think you will Ask the dear God to help you and try to spare us
both another scene like this

Tommy saw no more for he crept back to the hall looking so excited and
sober that the boys crowded round him to ask what was being done to Nat

In a most impressive whisper Tommy told them and they looked as if the
sky was about to fall for this reversing the order of things almost
took their breath away

He made me do the same thing once said Emil as if confessing a crime
of the deepest dye

And you hit him dear old Father Bhaer By thunder Id just like
to see you do it now said Ned collaring Emil in a fit of righteous
wrath

It was ever so long ago Id rather have my head cut off than do it
now and Emil mildly laid Ned on his back instead of cuffing him as he
would have felt it his duty to do on any less solemn occasion

How could you said Demi appalled at the idea

I was hopping mad at the time and thought I shouldnt mind a
bit rather like it perhaps But when Id hit uncle one good crack
everything he had ever done for me came into my head all at once
somehow and I couldnt go on No sir If hed laid me down and walked
on me I wouldnt have minded I felt so mean and Emil gave himself a
good thump in the chest to express his sense of remorse for the past

Nats crying like anything and feels no end sorry so dont lets say
a word about it will we said tenderhearted Tommy

Of course we wont but its awful to tell lies and Demi looked as if
he found the awfulness much increased when the punishment fell not upon
the sinner but his best Uncle Fritz

Suppose we all clear out so Nat can cut upstairs if he wants to
proposed Franz and led the way to the barn their refuge in troublous
times

Nat did not come to dinner but Mrs Jo took some up to him and said a
tender word which did him good though he could not look at her By and
by the lads playing outside heard the violin and said among themselves
Hes all right now He was all right but felt shy about going down
till opening his door to slip away into the woods he found Daisy
sitting on the stairs with neither work nor doll only her little
handkerchief in her hand as if she had been mourning for her captive
friend

Im going to walk want to come asked Nat trying to look as if
nothing was the matter yet feeling very grateful for her silent
sympathy because he fancied everyone must look upon him as a wretch

Oh yes and Daisy ran for her hat proud to be chosen as a companion
by one of the big boys

The others saw them go but no one followed for boys have a great deal
more delicacy than they get credit for and the lads instinctively felt
that when in disgrace gentle little Daisy was their most congenial
friend

The walk did Nat good and he came home quieter than usual but looking
cheerful again and hung all over with daisychains made by his little
playmate while he lay on the grass and told her stories

No one said a word about the scene of the morning but its effect was
all the more lasting for that reason perhaps Nat tried his very best
and found much help not only from the earnest little prayers he prayed
to his Friend in heaven but also in the patient care of the earthly
friend whose kind hand he never touched without remembering that it had
willingly borne pain for his sake



CHAPTER V PATTYPANS

Whats the matter Daisy

The boys wont let me play with them

Why not

They say girls cant play football

They can for Ive done it and Mrs Bhaer laughed at the remembrance
of certain youthful frolics

I know I can play Demi and I used to and have nice times but he
wont let me now because the other boys laugh at him and Daisy looked
deeply grieved at her brothers hardness of heart

On the whole I think he is right deary Its all very well when you
two are alone but it is too rough a game for you with a dozen boys so
Id find some nice little play for myself

Im tired of playing alone and Daisys tone was very mournful

Ill play with you by and by but just now I must fly about and get
things ready for a trip into town You shall go with me and see mamma
and if you like you can stay with her

I should like to go and see her and Baby Josy but Id rather come
back please Demi would miss me and I love to be here Aunty

You cant get on without your Demi can you and Aunt Jo looked as if
she quite understood the love of the little girl for her only brother

Course I cant were twins and so we love each other more than other
people answered Daisy with a brightening face for she considered
being a twin one of the highest honors she could ever receive

Now what will you do with your little self while I fly around asked
Mrs Bhaer who was whisking piles of linen into a wardrobe with great
rapidity

I dont know Im tired of dolls and things I wish youd make up a new
play for me Aunty Jo said Daisy swinging listlessly on the door

I shall have to think of a brand new one and it will take me some
time so suppose you go down and see what Asia has got for your lunch
suggested Mrs Bhaer thinking that would be a good way in which to
dispose of the little hindrance for a time

Yes I think Id like that if she isnt cross and Daisy slowly
departed to the kitchen where Asia the black cook reigned
undisturbed

In five minutes Daisy was back again with a wideawake face a bit of
dough in her hand and a dab of flour on her little nose

Oh aunty Please could I go and make gingersnaps and things Asia isnt
cross and she says I may and it would be such fun please do cried
Daisy all in one breath

Just the thing go and welcome make what you like and stay as long as
you please answered Mrs Bhaer much relieved for sometimes the one
little girl was harder to amuse than the dozen boys

Daisy ran off and while she worked Aunt Jo racked her brain for a
new play All of a sudden she seemed to have an idea for she smiled
to herself slammed the doors of the wardrobe and walked briskly away
saying Ill do it if its a possible thing

What it was no one found out that day but Aunt Jos eyes twinkled so
when she told Daisy she had thought of a new play and was going to buy
it that Daisy was much excited and asked questions all the way into
town without getting answers that told her anything She was left at
home to play with the new baby and delight her mothers eyes while
Aunt Jo went off shopping When she came back with all sorts of queer
parcels in corners of the carryall Daisy was so full of curiosity that
she wanted to go back to Plumfield at once But her aunt would not be
hurried and made a long call in mammas room sitting on the floor with
baby in her lap making Mrs Brooke laugh at the pranks of the boys and
all sorts of droll nonsense

How her aunt told the secret Daisy could not imagine but her mother
evidently knew it for she said as she tied on the little bonnet and
kissed the rosy little face inside Be a good child my Daisy and
learn the nice new play aunty has got for you Its a most useful and
interesting one and it is very kind of her to play it with you because
she does not like it very well herself

This last speech made the two ladies laugh heartily and increased
Daisys bewilderment As they drove away something rattled in the back
of the carriage

Whats that asked Daisy pricking up her ears

The new play answered Mrs Jo solemnly

What is it made of cried Daisy

Iron tin wood brass sugar salt coal and a hundred other things

How strange What color is it

All sorts of colors

Is it large

Part of it is and a part isnt

Did I ever see one

Ever so many but never one so nice as this

Oh what can it be I cant wait When shall I see it and Daisy
bounced up and down with impatience

Tomorrow morning after lessons

Is it for the boys too

No all for you and Bess The boys will like to see it and want to
play one part of it But you can do as you like about letting them

Ill let Demi if he wants to

No fear that they wont all want to especially Stuffy and Mrs
Bhaers eyes twinkled more than ever as she patted a queer knobby bundle
in her lap

Let me feel just once prayed Daisy

Not a feel youd guess in a minute and spoil the fun

Daisy groaned and then smiled all over her face for through a little
hole in the paper she caught a glimpse of something bright

How can I wait so long Couldnt I see it today

Oh dear no It has got to be arranged and ever so many parts fixed in
their places I promised Uncle Teddy that you shouldnt see it till it
was all in applepie order

If uncle knows about it then it must be splendid cried Daisy
clapping her hands for this kind rich jolly uncle of hers was as
good as a fairy godmother to the children and was always planning merry
surprises pretty gifts and droll amusements for them

Yes Teddy went and bought it with me and we had such fun in the shop
choosing the different parts He would have everything fine and large
and my little plan got regularly splendid when he took hold You must
give him your very best kiss when he comes for he is the kindest uncle
that ever went and bought a charming little coo Bless me I nearly told
you what it was and Mrs Bhaer cut that most interesting word short
off in the middle and began to look over her bills as if afraid she
would let the cat out of the bag if she talked any more Daisy folded
her hands with an air of resignation and sat quite still trying to
think what play had a coo in it

When they got home she eyed every bundle that was taken out and one
large heavy one which Franz took straight upstairs and hid in the
nursery filled her with amazement and curiosity Something very
mysterious went on up there that afternoon for Franz was hammering
and Asia trotting up and down and Aunt Jo flying around like a
willothewisp with all sort of things under her apron while little
Ted who was the only child admitted because he couldnt talk plain
babbled and laughed and tried to tell what the sumpin pitty was

All this made Daisy halfwild and her excitement spread among the boys
who quite overwhelmed Mother Bhaer with offers of assistance which she
declined by quoting their own words to Daisy

Girls cant play with boys This is for Daisy and Bess and me so
we dont want you Whereupon the young gentlemen meekly retired and
invited Daisy to a game of marbles horse football anything she liked
with a sudden warmth and politeness which astonished her innocent little
soul

Thanks to these attentions she got through the afternoon went early
to bed and next morning did her lessons with an energy which made Uncle
Fritz wish that a new game could be invented every day Quite a thrill
pervaded the schoolroom when Daisy was dismissed at eleven oclock
for everyone knew that now she was going to have the new and mysterious
play

Many eyes followed her as she ran away and Demis mind was so
distracted by this event that when Franz asked him where the desert
of Sahara was he mournfully replied In the nursery and the whole
school laughed at him

Aunt Jo Ive done all my lessons and I cant wait one single minute
more cried Daisy flying into Mrs Bhaers room

Its all ready come on and tucking Ted under one arm and her
workbasket under the other Aunt Jo promptly led the way upstairs

I dont see anything said Daisy staring about her as she got inside
the nursery door

Do you hear anything asked Aunt Jo catching Ted back by his little
frock as he was making straight for one side of the room

Daisy did hear an odd crackling and then a purry little sound as of a
kettle singing These noises came from behind a curtain drawn before a
deep bay window Daisy snatched it back gave one joyful Oh and then
stood gazing with delight at what do you think

A wide seat ran round the three sides of the window on one side hung
and stood all sorts of little pots and pans gridirons and skillets
on the other side a small dinner and tea set and on the middle part a
cookingstove Not a tin one that was of no use but a real iron stove
big enough to cook for a large family of very hungry dolls But the best
of it was that a real fire burned in it real steam came out of the
nose of the little teakettle and the lid of the little boiler actually
danced a jig the water inside bubbled so hard A pane of glass had
been taken out and replaced by a sheet of tin with a hole for the small
funnel and real smoke went sailing away outside so naturally that it
did ones heart good to see it The box of wood with a hod of charcoal
stood near by just above hung dustpan brush and broom a little
market basket was on the low table at which Daisy used to play and over
the back of her little chair hung a white apron with a bib and a droll
mob cap The sun shone in as if he enjoyed the fun the little stove
roared beautifully the kettle steamed the new tins sparkled on the
walls the pretty china stood in tempting rows and it was altogether as
cheery and complete a kitchen as any child could desire

Daisy stood quite still after the first glad Oh but her eyes went
quickly from one charming object to another brightening as they looked
till they came to Aunt Jos merry face there they stopped as the happy
little girl hugged her saying gratefully

Oh aunty its a splendid new play Can I really cook at the dear
stove and have parties and mess and sweep and make fires that truly
burn I like it so much What made you think of it

Your liking to make gingersnaps with Asia made me think of it said
Mrs Bhaer holding Daisy who frisked as if she would fly I knew Asia
wouldnt let you mess in her kitchen very often and it wouldnt be
safe at this fire up here so I thought Id see if I could find a little
stove for you and teach you to cook that would be fun and useful too
So I travelled round among the toy shops but everything large cost too
much and I was thinking I should have to give it up when I met Uncle
Teddy As soon as he knew what I was about he said he wanted to help
and insisted on buying the biggest toy stove we could find I scolded
but he only laughed and teased me about my cooking when we were young
and said I must teach Bess as well as you and went on buying all sorts
of nice little things for my cooking class as he called it

Im so glad you met him said Daisy as Mrs Jo stopped to laugh at
the memory of the funny time she had with Uncle Teddy

You must study hard and learn to make all kinds of things for he says
he shall come out to tea very often and expects something uncommonly
nice

Its the sweetest dearest kitchen in the world and Id rather
study with it than do anything else Cant I learn pies and cake and
macaroni and everything cried Daisy dancing round the room with a
new saucepan in one hand and the tiny poker in the other

All in good time This is to be a useful play I am to help you and
you are to be my cook so I shall tell you what to do and show you how
Then we shall have things fit to eat and you will be really learning
how to cook on a small scale Ill call you Sally and say you are a new
girl just come added Mrs Jo settling down to work while Teddy sat
on the floor sucking his thumb and staring at the stove as if it was a
live thing whose appearance deeply interested him

That will be so lovely What shall I do first asked Sally with such
a happy face and willing air that Aunt Jo wished all new cooks were half
as pretty and pleasant

First of all put on this clean cap and apron I am rather
oldfashioned and I like my cook to be very tidy

Sally tucked her curly hair into the round cap and put on the apron
without a murmur though usually she rebelled against bibs

Now you can put things in order and wash up the new china The old
set needs washing also for my last girl was apt to leave it in a sad
state after a party

Aunt Jo spoke quite soberly but Sally laughed for she knew who the
untidy girl was who had left the cups sticky Then she turned up her
cuffs and with a sigh of satisfaction began to stir about her kitchen
having little raptures now and then over the sweet rolling pin the
darling dishtub or the cunning pepperpot

Now Sally take your basket and go to market here is the list of
things I want for dinner said Mrs Jo giving her a bit of paper when
the dishes were all in order

Where is the market asked Daisy thinking that the new play got more
and more interesting every minute

Asia is the market

Away went Sally causing another stir in the schoolroom as she passed
the door in her new costume and whispered to Demi with a face full of
delight Its a perfectly splendid play

Old Asia enjoyed the joke as much as Daisy and laughed jollily as the
little girl came flying into the room with her cap all on one side the
lids of her basket rattling like castanets and looking like a very crazy
little cook

Mrs Aunt Jo wants these things and I must have them right away said
Daisy importantly

Lets see honey heres two pounds of steak potatoes squash apples
bread and butter The meat aint come yet when it does Ill send it
up The other things are all handy

Then Asia packed one potato one apple a bit of squash a little pat
of butter and a roll into the basket telling Sally to be on the watch
for the butchers boy because he sometimes played tricks

Who is he and Daisy hoped it would be Demi

Youll see was all Asia would say and Sally went off in great
spirits singing a verse from dear Mary Howitts sweet story in rhyme

 Away went little Mabel
 With the wheaten cake so fine
 The newmade pot of butter
 And the little flask of wine

Put everything but the apple into the storecloset for the present
said Mrs Jo when the cook got home

There was a cupboard under the middle shelf and on opening the door
fresh delights appeared One half was evidently the cellar for wood
coal and kindlings were piled there The other half was full of little
jars boxes and all sorts of droll contrivances for holding small
quantities of flour meal sugar salt and other household stores A
pot of jam was there a little tin box of gingerbread a cologne bottle
full of currant wine and a tiny canister of tea But the crowning charm
was two dolls pans of new milk with cream actually rising on it and
a wee skimmer all ready to skim it with Daisy clasped her hands at
this delicious spectacle and wanted to skim it immediately But Aunt Jo
said

Not yet you will want the cream to eat on your apple pie at dinner
and must not disturb it till then

Am I going to have pie cried Daisy hardly believing that such bliss
could be in store for her

Yes if your oven does well we will have two pies one apple and one
strawberry said Mrs Jo who was nearly as much interested in the new
play as Daisy herself

Oh what next asked Sally all impatience to begin

Shut the lower draught of the stove so that the oven may heat
Then wash your hands and get out the flour sugar salt butter and
cinnamon See if the pieboard is clean and pare your apple ready to
put in

Daisy got things together with as little noise and spilling as could be
expected from so young a cook

I really dont know how to measure for such tiny pies I must guess
at it and if these dont succeed we must try again said Mrs Jo
looking rather perplexed and very much amused with the small concern
before her Take that little pan full of flour put in a pinch of salt
and then rub in as much butter as will go on that plate Always remember
to put your dry things together first and then the wet It mixes better
so

I know how I saw Asia do it Dont I butter the pie plates too She
did the first thing said Daisy whisking the flour about at a great
rate

Quite right I do believe you have a gift for cooking you take to it
so cleverly said Aunt Jo approvingly Now a dash of cold water
just enough to wet it then scatter some flour on the board work in
a little and roll the paste out yes thats the way Now put dabs of
butter all over it and roll it out again We wont have our pastry very
rich or the dolls will get dyspeptic

Daisy laughed at the idea and scattered the dabs with a liberal hand
Then she rolled and rolled with her delightful little pin and having
got her paste ready proceeded to cover the plates with it Next the
apple was sliced in sugar and cinnamon lavishly sprinkled over it and
then the top crust put on with breathless care

I always wanted to cut them round and Asia never would let me How
nice it is to do it all my ownty donty self said Daisy as the little
knife went clipping round the dolls plate poised on her hand

All cooks even the best meet with mishaps sometimes and Sallys first
one occurred then for the knife went so fast that the plate slipped
turned a somersault in the air and landed the dear little pie upside
down on the floor Sally screamed Mrs Jo laughed Teddy scrambled to
get it and for a moment confusion reigned in the new kitchen

It didnt spill or break because I pinched the edges together so hard
it isnt hurt a bit so Ill prick holes in it and then it will be
ready said Sally picking up the capsized treasure and putting it into
shape with a childlike disregard of the dust it had gathered in its
fall

My new cook has a good temper I see and that is such a comfort said
Mrs Jo Now open the jar of strawberry jam fill the uncovered pie
and put some strips of paste over the top as Asia does

Ill make a D in the middle and have zigzags all round that will be
so interesting when I come to eat it said Sally loading the pie with
quirls and flourishes that would have driven a real pastry cook wild
Now I put them in she exclaimed when the last grimy knob had been
carefully planted in the red field of jam and with an air of triumph
she shut them into the little oven

Clear up your things a good cook never lets her utensils collect Then
pare your squash and potatoes

There is only one potato giggled Sally

Cut it in four pieces so it will go into the little kettle and put
the bits into cold water till it is time to cook them

Do I soak the squash too

No indeed Just pare it and cut it up and put in into the steamer
over the pot It is drier so though it takes longer to cook

Here a scratching at the door caused Sally to run and open it when Kit
appeared with a covered basket in his mouth

Heres the butcher boy cried Daisy much tickled at the idea as she
relieved him of his load whereat he licked his lips and began to beg
evidently thinking that it was his own dinner for he often carried it
to his master in that way Being undeceived he departed in great wrath
and barked all the way downstairs to ease his wounded feelings

In the basket were two bits of steak dolls pounds a baked pear a
small cake and paper with them on which Asia had scrawled For Missys
lunch if her cookin dont turn out well

I dont want any of her old pears and things my cooking will turn out
well and Ill have a splendid dinner see if I dont cried Daisy
indignantly

We may like them if company should come It is always well to have
something in the storeroom said Aunt Jo who had been taught this
valuable fact by a series of domestic panics

Me is hundry announced Teddy who began to think what with so much
cooking going on it was about time for somebody to eat something His
mother gave him her workbasket to rummage hoping to keep him quiet till
dinner was ready and returned to her housekeeping

Put on your vegetables set the table and then have some coals
kindling ready for the steak

What a thing it was to see the potatoes bobbing about in the little pot
to peep at the squash getting soft so fast in the tiny steamer to whisk
open the oven door every five minutes to see how the pies got on and
at last when the coals were red and glowing to put two real steaks on
a fingerlong gridiron and proudly turn them with a fork The potatoes
were done first and no wonder for they had boiled frantically all the
while The were pounded up with a little pestle had much butter and no
salt put in cook forgot it in the excitement of the moment then it
was made into a mound in a gay red dish smoothed over with a knife
dipped in milk and put in the oven to brown

So absorbed in these last performances had Sally been that she forgot
her pastry till she opened the door to put in the potato then a wail
arose for alas alas the little pies were burnt black

Oh my pies My darling pies They are all spoilt cried poor Sally
wringing her dirty little hands as she surveyed the ruin of her work
The tart was especially pathetic for the quirls and zigzags stuck up in
all directions from the blackened jelly like the walls and chimney of a
house after a fire

Dear dear I forgot to remind you to take them out its just my
luck said Aunt Jo remorsefully Dont cry darling it was my fault
well try again after dinner she added as a great tear dropped from
Sallys eyes and sizzled on the hot ruins of the tart

More would have followed if the steak had not blazed up just then
and so occupied the attention of cook that she quickly forgot the lost
pastry

Put the meatdish and your own plates down to warm while you mash the
squash with butter salt and a little pepper on the top said Mrs Jo
devoutly hoping that the dinner would meet with no further disasters

The cunning pepperpot soothed Sallys feelings and she dished up her
squash in fine style The dinner was safely put upon the table the six
dolls were seated three on a side Teddy took the bottom and Sally the
top When all were settled it was a most imposing spectacle for one
doll was in full ball costume another in her nightgown Jerry the
worsted boy wore his red winter suit while Annabella the noseless
darling was airily attired in nothing but her own kid skin Teddy as
father of the family behaved with great propriety for he smilingly
devoured everything offered him and did not find a single fault Daisy
beamed upon her company like the weary warm but hospitable hostess so
often to be seen at larger tables than this and did the honors with an
air of innocent satisfaction which we do not often see elsewhere

The steak was so tough that the little carvingknife would not cut it
the potato did not go round and the squash was very lumpy but the
guests appeared politely unconscious of these trifles and the master
and mistress of the house cleared the table with appetites that anyone
might envy them The joy of skimming a jugfull of cream mitigated the
anguish felt for the loss of the pies and Asias despised cake proved a
treasure in the way of dessert

That is the nicest lunch I ever had cant I do it every day asked
Daisy as she scraped up and ate the leavings all round

You can cook things every day after lessons but I prefer that you
should eat your dishes at your regular meals and only have a bit of
gingerbread for lunch Today being the first time I dont mind but
we must keep our rules This afternoon you can make something for tea
if you like said Mrs Jo who had enjoyed the dinnerparty very much
though no one had invited her to partake

Do let me make flapjacks for Demi he loves them so and its such fun
to turn them and put sugar in between cried Daisy tenderly wiping a
yellow stain off Annabellas broken nose for Bella had refused to eat
squash when it was pressed upon her as good for lumatism a complaint
which it is no wonder she suffered from considering the lightness of
her attire

But if you give Demi goodies all the others will expect some also and
then you will have your hands full

Couldnt I have Demi come up to tea alone just this one time And after
that I could cook things for the others if they were good proposed
Daisy with a sudden inspiration

That is a capital idea Posy We will make your little messes rewards
for the good boys and I dont know one among them who would not like
something nice to eat more than almost anything else If little men are
like big ones good cooking will touch their hearts and soothe their
tempers delightfully added Aunt Jo with a merry nod toward the
door where stood Papa Bhaer surveying the scene with a face full of
amusement

That last hit was for me sharp woman I accept it for it is true but
if I had married thee for thy cooking hearts dearest I should have
fared badly all these years answered the professor laughing as he
tossed Teddy who became quite apoplectic in his endeavors to describe
the feast he had just enjoyed

Daisy proudly showed her kitchen and rashly promised Uncle Fritz as
many flapjacks as he could eat She was just telling about the new
rewards when the boys headed by Demi burst into the room snuffing the
air like a pack of hungry hounds for school was out dinner was not
ready and the fragrance of Daisys steak led them straight to the spot

A prouder little damsel was never seen than Sally as she displayed her
treasures and told the lads what was in store for them Several rather
scoffed at the idea of her cooking anything fit to eat but Stuffys
heart was won at once Nat and Demi had firm faith in her skill and the
others said they would wait and see All admired the kitchen however
and examined the stove with deep interest Demi offered to buy
the boiler on the spot to be used in a steamengine which he was
constructing and Ned declared that the best and biggest saucepan was
just the thing to melt his lead in when he ran bullets hatchets and
such trifles

Daisy looked so alarmed at these proposals that Mrs Jo then and
there made and proclaimed a law that no boy should touch use or
even approach the sacred stove without a special permit from the
owner thereof This increased its value immensely in the eyes of the
gentlemen especially as any infringement of the law would be punished
by forfeiture of all right to partake of the delicacies promised to the
virtuous

At this point the bell rang and the entire population went down to
dinner which meal was enlivened by each of the boys giving Daisy a
list of things he would like to have cooked for him as fast as he
earned them Daisy whose faith in her stove was unlimited promised
everything if Aunt Jo would tell her how to make them This suggestion
rather alarmed Mrs Jo for some of the dishes were quite beyond her
skill weddingcake for instance bullseye candy and cabbage soup
with herrings and cherries in it which Mr Bhaer proposed as his
favorite and immediately reduced his wife to despair for German
cookery was beyond her

Daisy wanted to begin again the minute dinner was done but she was only
allowed to clear up fill the kettle ready for tea and wash out her
apron which looked as if she had a Christmas feast She was then sent
out to play till five oclock for Uncle Fritz said that too much study
even at cooking stoves was bad for little minds and bodies and Aunt Jo
knew by long experience how soon new toys lose their charm if they are
not prudently used

Everyone was very kind to Daisy that afternoon Tommy promised her the
first fruits of his garden though the only visible crop just then was
pigweed Nat offered to supply her with wood free of charge Stuffy
quite worshipped her Ned immediately fell to work on a little
refrigerator for her kitchen and Demi with a punctuality beautiful
to see in one so young escorted her to the nursery just as the clock
struck five It was not time for the party to begin but he begged so
hard to come in and help that he was allowed privileges few visitors
enjoy for he kindled the fire ran errands and watched the progress
of his supper with intense interest Mrs Jo directed the affair as she
came and went being very busy putting up clean curtains all over the
house

Ask Asia for a cup of sour cream then your cakes will be light without
much soda which I dont like was the first order

Demi tore downstairs and returned with the cream also a puckeredup
face for he had tasted it on his way and found it so sour that he
predicted the cakes would be uneatable Mrs Jo took this occasion to
deliver a short lecture from the stepladder on the chemical properties
of soda to which Daisy did not listen but Demi did and understood it
as he proved by the brief but comprehensive reply

Yes I see soda turns sour things sweet and the fizzling up makes
them light Lets see you do it Daisy

Fill that bowl nearly full of flour and add a little salt to it
continued Mrs Jo

Oh dear everything has to have salt in it seems to me said Sally
who was tired of opening the pillbox in which it was kept

Salt is like goodhumor and nearly every thing is better for a pinch
of it Posy and Uncle Fritz stopped as he passed hammer in hand to
drive up two or three nails for Sallys little pans to hang on

You are not invited to tea but Ill give you some cakes and I wont
be cross said Daisy putting up her floury little face to thank him
with a kiss

Fritz you must not interrupt my cooking class or Ill come in and
moralize when you are teaching Latin How would you like that said
Mrs Jo throwing a great chintz curtain down on his head

Very much try it and see and the amiable Father Bhaer went singing
and tapping about the house like a mammoth woodpecker

Put the soda into the cream and when it fizzles as Demi says stir
it into the flour and beat it up as hard as ever you can Have your
griddle hot butter it well and then fry away till I come back and
Aunt Jo vanished also

Such a clatter as the little spoon made and such a beating as the
batter got it quite foamed I assure you and when Daisy poured some
on to the griddle it rose like magic into a puffy flapjack that made
Demis mouth water To be sure the first one stuck and scorched
because she forgot the butter but after that first failure all went
well and six capital little cakes were safely landed in a dish

I think I like maplesyrup better than sugar said Demi from his
armchair where he had settled himself after setting the table in a new
and peculiar manner

Then go and ask Asia for some answered Daisy going into the
bathroom to wash her hands

While the nursery was empty something dreadful happened You see Kit
had been feeling hurt all day because he had carried meat safely and yet
got none to pay him He was not a bad dog but he had his little faults
like the rest of us and could not always resist temptation Happening
to stroll into the nursery at that moment he smelt the cakes saw them
unguarded on the low table and never stopping to think of consequences
swallowed all six at one mouthful I am glad to say that they were very
hot and burned him so badly that he could not repress a surprised yelp
Daisy heard it ran in saw the empty dish also the end of a yellow
tail disappearing under the bed Without a word she seized that tail
pulled out the thief and shook him till his ears flapped wildly then
bundled him downstairs to the shed where he spent a lonely evening in
the coalbin

Cheered by the sympathy which Demi gave her Daisy made another bowlful
of batter and fried a dozen cakes which were even better than the
others Indeed Uncle Fritz after eating two sent up word that he had
never tasted any so nice and every boy at the table below envied Demi
at the flapjack party above

It was a truly delightful supper for the little teapot lid only fell
off three times and the milk jug upset but once the cakes floated in
syrup and the toast had a delicious beefsteak flavor owing to cooks
using the gridiron to make it on Demi forgot philosophy and stuffed
like any carnal boy while Daisy planned sumptuous banquets and the
dolls looked on smiling affably

Well dearies have you had a good time asked Mrs Jo coming up with
Teddy on her shoulder

A very good time I shall come again soon answered Demi with
emphasis

Im afraid you have eaten too much by the look of that table

No I havent I only ate fifteen cakes and they were very little
ones protested Demi who had kept his sister busy supplying his plate

They wont hurt him they are so nice said Daisy with such a funny
mixture of maternal fondness and housewifely pride that Aunt Jo could
only smile and say

Well on the whole the new game is a success then

I like it said Demi as if his approval was all that was necessary

It is the dearest play ever made cried Daisy hugging her little
dishtub as she proposed to wash up the cups I just wish everybody
had a sweet cooking stove like mine she added regarding it with
affection

This play out to have a name said Demi gravely removing the syrup
from his countenance with his tongue

It has

Oh what asked both children eagerly

Well I think we will call it Pattypans and Aunt Jo retired
satisfied with the success of her last trap to catch a sunbeam



CHAPTER VI A FIRE BRAND

Please maam could I speak to you It is something very important
said Nat popping his head in at the door of Mrs Bhaers room

It was the fifth head which had popped in during the last halfhour but
Mrs Jo was used to it so she looked up and said briskly

What is it my lad

Nat came in shut the door carefully behind him and said in an eager
anxious tone

Dan has come

Who is Dan

Hes a boy I used to know when I fiddled round the streets He sold
papers and he was kind to me and I saw him the other day in town and
told him how nice it was here and hes come

But my dear boy that is rather a sudden way to pay a visit

Oh it isnt a visit he wants to stay if you will let him said Nat
innocently

Well I dont know about that began Mrs Bhaer rather startled by
the coolness of the proposition

Why I thought you liked to have poor boys come and live with you
and be kind to em as you were to me said Nat looking surprised and
alarmed

So I do but I like to know something about them first I have to
choose them because there are so many I have not room for all I wish
I had

I told him to come because I thought youd like it but if there isnt
room he can go away again said Nat sorrowfully

The boys confidence in her hospitality touched Mrs Bhaer and she
could not find the heart to disappoint his hope and spoil his kind
little plan so she said

Tell me about this Dan

I dont know any thing only he hasnt got any folks and hes poor
and he was good to me so Id like to be good to him if I could

Excellent reasons every one but really Nat the house is full and
I dont know where I could put him said Mrs Bhaer more and more
inclined to prove herself the haven of refuge he seemed to think her

He could have my bed and I could sleep in the barn It isnt cold
now and I dont mind I used to sleep anywhere with father said Nat
eagerly

Something in his speech and face made Mrs Jo put her hand on his
shoulder and say in her kindest tone

Bring in your friend Nat I think we must find room for him without
giving him your place

Nat joyfully ran off and soon returned followed by a most
unprepossessing boy who slouched in and stood looking about him with a
half bold half sullen look which made Mrs Bhaer say to herself after
one glance

A bad specimen I am afraid

This is Dan said Nat presenting him as if sure of his welcome

Nat tells me you would like to come and stay with us began Mrs Jo
in a friendly tone

Yes was the gruff reply

Have you no friends to take care of you

No

Say No maam whispered Nat

Shant neither muttered Dan

How old are you

About fourteen

You look older What can you do

Most anything

If you stay here we shall want you to do as the others do work and
study as well as play Are you willing to agree to that

Dont mind trying

Well you can stay a few days and we will see how we get on together
Take him out Nat and amuse him till Mr Bhaer comes home when we will
settle about the matter said Mrs Jo finding it rather difficult to
get on with this cool young person who fixed his big black eyes on her
with a hard suspicious expression sorrowfully unboyish

Come on Nat he said and slouched out again

Thank you maam added Nat as he followed him feeling without quite
understanding the difference in the welcome given to him and to his
ungracious friend

The fellows are having a circus out in the barn dont you want to come
and see it he asked as they came down the wide steps on to the lawn

Are they big fellows said Dan

No the big ones are gone fishing

Fire away then said Dan

Nat led him to the great barn and introduced him to his set who were
disporting themselves among the halfempty lofts A large circle was
marked out with hay on the wide floor and in the middle stood Demi with
a long whip while Tommy mounted on the muchenduring Toby pranced
about the circle playing being a monkey

You must pay a pin apiece or you cant see the show said Stuffy
who stood by the wheelbarrow in which sat the band consisting of a
pocketcomb blown upon by Ned and a toy drum beaten spasmodically by
Rob

Hes company so Ill pay for both said Nat handsomely as he stuck
two crooked pins in the dried mushroom which served as moneybox

With a nod to the company they seated themselves on a couple of boards
and the performance went on After the monkey act Ned gave them a fine
specimen of his agility by jumping over an old chair and running up
and down ladders sailor fashion Then Demi danced a jig with a gravity
beautiful to behold Nat was called upon to wrestle with Stuffy and
speedily laid that stout youth upon the ground After this Tommy
proudly advanced to turn a somersault an accomplishment which he had
acquired by painful perseverance practising in private till every joint
of his little frame was black and blue His feats were received with
great applause and he was about to retire flushed with pride and a
rush of blood to the head when a scornful voice in the audience was
heard to say

Ho that aint any thing

Say that again will you and Tommy bristled up like an angry
turkeycock

Do you want to fight said Dan promptly descending from the barrel
and doubling up his fists in a businesslike manner

No I dont and the candid Thomas retired a step rather taken aback
by the proposition

Fighting isnt allowed cried the others much excited

Youre a nice lot sneered Dan

Come if you dont behave you shant stay said Nat firing up at
that insult to his friends

Id like to see him do better than I did thats all observed Tommy
with a swagger

Clear the way then and without the slightest preparation Dan turned
three somersaults one after the other and came up on his feet

You cant beat that Tom you always hit your head and tumble flat
said Nat pleased at his friends success

Before he could say any more the audience were electrified by three more
somersaults backwards and a short promenade on the hands head down
feet up This brought down the house and Tommy joined in the admiring
cries which greeted the accomplished gymnast as he righted himself and
looked at them with an air of calm superiority

Do you think I could learn to do it without its hurting me very much
Tom meekly asked as he rubbed the elbows which still smarted after the
last attempt

What will you give me if Ill teach you said Dan

My new jackknife its got five blades and only one is broken

Give it here then

Tommy handed it over with an affectionate look at its smooth handle
Dan examined it carefully then putting it into his pocket walked off
saying with a wink

Keep it up till you learn thats all

A howl of wrath from Tommy was followed by a general uproar which did
not subside till Dan finding himself in a minority proposed that they
should play stickknife and whichever won should have the treasure
Tommy agreed and the game was played in a circle of excited faces
which all wore an expression of satisfaction when Tommy won and secured
the knife in the depth of his safest pocket

You come off with me and Ill show you round said Nat feeling that
he must have a little serious conversation with his friend in private

What passed between them no one knew but when they appeared again Dan
was more respectful to every one though still gruff in his speech and
rough in his manner and what else could be expected of the poor lad
who had been knocking about the world all his short life with no one to
teach him any better

The boys had decided that they did not like him and so they left him
to Nat who soon felt rather oppressed by the responsibility but too
kindhearted to desert him

Tommy however felt that in spite of the jackknife transaction
there was a bond of sympathy between them and longed to return to the
interesting subject of somersaults He soon found an opportunity for
Dan seeing how much he admired him grew more amiable and by the end
of the first week was quite intimate with the lively Tom

Mr Bhaer when he heard the story and saw Dan shook his head but only
said quietly

The experiment may cost us something but we will try it

If Dan felt any gratitude for his protection he did not show it and
took without thanks all that was give him He was ignorant but very
quick to learn when he chose had sharp eyes to watch what went on about
him a saucy tongue rough manners and a temper that was fierce and
sullen by turns He played with all his might and played well at almost
all the games He was silent and gruff before grown people and only
now and then was thoroughly sociable among the lads Few of them really
liked him but few could help admiring his courage and strength for
nothing daunted him and he knocked tall Franz flat on one occasion with
an ease that caused all the others to keep at a respectful distance from
his fists Mr Bhaer watched him silently and did his best to tame the
Wild Boy as they called him but in private the worthy man shook his
head and said soberly I hope the experiment will turn out well but I
am a little afraid it may cost too much

Mrs Bhaer lost her patience with him half a dozen times a day yet
never gave him up and always insisted that there was something good
in the lad after all for he was kinder to animals than to people he
liked to rove about in the woods and best of all little Ted was fond
of him What the secret was no one could discover but Baby took to him
at once gabbled and crowed whenever he saw him preferred his strong back
to ride on to any of the others and called him My Danny out of his
own little head Teddy was the only creature to whom Dan showed an
affection and this was only manifested when he thought no one
else would see it but mothers eyes are quick and motherly hearts
instinctively divine who love their babies So Mrs Jo soon saw and felt
that there was a soft spot in rough Dan and bided her time to touch and
win him

But an unexpected and decidedly alarming event upset all their plans
and banished Dan from Plumfield

Tommy Nat and Demi began by patronizing Dan because the other
lads rather slighted him but soon they each felt there was a certain
fascination about the bad boy and from looking down upon him they came
to looking up each for a different reason Tommy admired his skill and
courage Nat was grateful for past kindness and Demi regarded him as
a sort of animated story book for when he chose Dan could tell his
adventures in a most interesting way It pleased Dan to have the three
favorites like him and he exerted himself to be agreeable which was
the secret of his success

The Bhaers were surprised but hoped the lads would have a good
influence over Dan and waited with some anxiety trusting that no harm
would come of it

Dan felt they did not quite trust him and never showed them his best
side but took a wilful pleasure in trying their patience and thwarting
their hopes as far as he dared

Mr Bhaer did not approve of fighting and did not think it a proof of
either manliness or courage for two lads to pommel one another for
the amusement of the rest All sorts of hardy games and exercises were
encouraged and the boys were expected to take hard knocks and tumbles
without whining but black eyes and bloody noses given for the fun of it
were forbidden as a foolish and a brutal play

Dan laughed at this rule and told such exciting tales of his own valor
and the many frays that he had been in that some of the lads were fired
with a desire to have a regular good mill

Dont tell and Ill show you how said Dan and getting half a dozen
of the lads together behind the barn he gave them a lesson in boxing
which quite satisfied the ardor of most of them Emil however could
not submit to be beaten by a fellow younger than himself for Emil was
past fourteen and a plucky fellow so he challenged Dan to a fight Dan
accepted at once and the others looked on with intense interest

What little bird carried the news to headquarters no one ever knew
but in the very hottest of the fray when Dan and Emil were fighting
like a pair of young bulldogs and the others with fierce excited
faces were cheering them on Mr Bhaer walked into the ring plucked the
combatants apart with a strong hand and said in the voice they seldom
heard

I cant allow this boys Stop it at once and never let me see it
again I keep a school for boys not for wild beasts Look at each other
and be ashamed of yourselves

You let me go and Ill knock him down again shouted Dan sparring
away in spite of the grip on his collar

Come on come on I aint thrashed yet cried Emil who had been down
five times but did not know when he was beaten

They are playing be gladdy whatyoucallems like the Romans Uncle
Fritz called out Demi whose eyes were bigger than ever with the
excitement of this new pastime

They were a fine set of brutes but we have learned something since
then I hope and I cannot have you make my barn a Colosseum Who
proposed this asked Mr Bhaer

Dan answered several voices

Dont you know that it is forbidden

Yes growled Dan sullenly

Then why break the rule

Theyll all be mollycoddles if they dont know how to fight

Have you found Emil a mollycoddle He doesnt look much like one
and Mr Bhaer brought the two face to face Dan had a black eye and his
jacket was torn to rags but Emils face was covered with blood from a
cut lip and a bruised nose while a bump on his forehead was already as
purple as a plum In spite of his wounds however he still glared upon
his foe and evidently panted to renew the fight

Hed make a firstrater if he was taught said Dan unable to withhold
the praise from the boy who made it necessary for him to do his best

Hell be taught to fence and box by and by and till then I think
he will do very well without any lessons in mauling Go and wash your
faces and remember Dan if you break any more of the rules again you
will be sent away That was the bargain do your part and we will do
ours

The lads went off and after a few more words to the spectators Mr
Bhaer followed to bind up the wounds of the young gladiators Emil went
to bed sick and Dan was an unpleasant spectacle for a week

But the lawless lad had no thought of obeying and soon transgressed
again

One Saturday afternoon as a party of the boys went out to play Tommy
said

Lets go down to the river and cut a lot of new fishpoles

Take Toby to drag them back and one of us can ride him down proposed
Stuffy who hated to walk

That means you I suppose well hurry up lazybones said Dan

Away they went and having got the poles were about to go home when
Demi unluckily said to Tommy who was on Toby with a long rod in his
hand

You look like the picture of the man in the bullfight only you
havent got a red cloth or pretty clothes on

Id like to see one theres old Buttercup in the big meadow ride at
her Tom and see her run proposed Dan bent on mischief

No you mustnt began Demi who was learning to distrust Dans
propositions

Why not little fussbutton demanded Dan

I dont think Uncle Fritz would like it

Did he ever say we must not have a bullfight

No I dont think he ever did admitted Demi

Then hold your tongue Drive on Tom and heres a red rag to flap at
the old thing Ill help you to stir her up and over the wall went
Dan full of the new game and the rest followed like a flock of sheep
even Demi who sat upon the bars and watched the fun with interest

Poor Buttercup was not in a very good mood for she had been lately
bereft of her calf and mourned for the little thing most dismally Just
now she regarded all mankind as her enemies and I do not blame her
so when the matadore came prancing towards her with the red handkerchief
flying at the end of his long lance she threw up her head and gave
a most appropriate Moo Tommy rode gallantly at her and Toby
recognizing an old friend was quite willing to approach but when the
lance came down on her back with a loud whack both cow and donkey were
surprised and disgusted Toby back with a bray of remonstrance and
Buttercup lowered her horns angrily

At her again Tom shes jolly cross and will do it capitally called
Dan coming up behind with another rod while Jack and Ned followed his
example

Seeing herself thus beset and treated with such disrespect Buttercup
trotted round the field getting more and more bewildered and excited
every moment for whichever way she turned there was a dreadful boy
yelling and brandishing a new and very disagreeable sort of whip It was
great fun for them but real misery for her till she lost patience and
turned the tables in the most unexpected manner All at once she wheeled
short round and charged full at her old friend Toby whose conduct cut
her to the heart Poor slow Toby backed so precipitately that he tripped
over a stone and down went horse matadore and all in one ignominious
heap while distracted Buttercup took a surprising leap over the wall
and galloped wildly out of sight down the road

Catch her stop her head her off run boys run shouted Dan
tearing after her at his best pace for she was Mr Bhaers pet
Alderney and if anything happened to her Dan feared it would be all
over with him Such a running and racing and bawling and puffing as
there was before she was caught The fishpoles were left behind Toby
was trotted nearly off his legs in the chase and every boy was red
breathless and scared They found poor Buttercup at last in a flower
garden where she had taken refuge worn out with the long run
Borrowing a rope for a halter Dan led her home followed by a party
of very sober young gentlemen for the cow was in a sad state having
strained her shoulder jumping so that she limped her eyes looked wild
and her glossy coat was wet and muddy

Youll catch it this time Dan said Tommy as he led the wheezing
donkey beside the maltreated cow

So will you for you helped

We all did but Demi added Jack

He put it into our heads said Ned

I told you not to do it cried Demi who was most brokenhearted at
poor Buttercups state

Old Bhaer will send me off I guess Dont care if he does muttered
Dan looking worried in spite of his words

Well ask him not to all of us said Demi and the others assented
with the exception of Stuffy who cherished the hope that all the
punishment might fall on one guilty head Dan only said Dont bother
about me but he never forgot it even though he led the lads astray
again as soon as the temptation came

When Mr Bhaer saw the animal and heard the story he said very little
evidently fearing that he should say too much in the first moments of
impatience Buttercup was made comfortable in her stall and the boys
sent to their rooms till suppertime This brief respite gave them time
to think the matter over to wonder what the penalty would be and to
try to imagine where Dan would be sent He whistled briskly in his room
so that no one should think he cared a bit but while he waited to know
his fate the longing to stay grew stronger and stronger the more he
recalled the comfort and kindness he had known here the hardship and
neglect he had felt elsewhere He knew they tried to help him and at
the bottom of his heart he was grateful but his rough life had made
him hard and careless suspicious and wilful He hated restraint of any
sort and fought against it like an untamed creature even while he knew
it was kindly meant and dimly felt that he would be the better for it
He made up his mind to be turned adrift again to knock about the city
as he had done nearly all his life a prospect that made him knit
his black brows and look about the cosy little room with a wistful
expression that would have touched a much harder heart than Mr Bhaers
if he had seen it It vanished instantly however when the good man
came in and said in his accustomed grave way

I have heard all about it Dan and though you have broken the rules
again I am going to give you one more trial to please Mother Bhaer

Dan flushed up to his forehead at this unexpected reprieve but he only
said in his gruff way

I didnt know there was any rule about bullfighting

As I never expected to have any at Plumfield I never did make such
a rule answered Mr Bhaer smiling in spite of himself at the boys
excuse Then he added gravely But one of the first and most important
of our few laws is the law of kindness to every dumb creature on the
place I want everybody and everything to be happy here to love
and trust and serve us as we try to love and trust and serve them
faithfully and willingly I have often said that you were kinder to the
animals than any of the other boys and Mrs Bhaer liked that trait in
you very much because she thought it showed a good heart But you have
disappointed us in that and we are sorry for we hoped to make you
quite one of us Shall we try again

Dans eyes had been on the floor and his hands nervously picking at
the bit of wood he had been whittling as Mr Bhaer came in but when he
heard the kind voice ask that question he looked up quickly and said
in a more respectful tone than he had ever used before

Yes please

Very well then we will say no more only you will stay at home from
the walk tomorrow as the other boys will and all of you must wait on
poor Buttercup till she is well again

I will

Now go down to supper and do your best my boy more for your own
sake than for ours Then Mr Bhaer shook hands with him and Dan went
down more tamed by kindness than he would have been by the good whipping
which Asia had strongly recommended

Dan did try for a day or two but not being used to it he soon tired
and relapsed into his old wilful ways Mr Bhaer was called from home
on business one day and the boys had no lessons They liked this and
played hard till bedtime when most of them turned in and slept like
dormice Dan however had a plan in his head and when he and Nat were
alone he unfolded it

Look here he said taking from under his bed a bottle a cigar and a
pack of cards Im going to have some fun and do as I used to with
the fellows in town Heres some beer I got if of the old man at the
station and this cigar you can pay for em or Tommy will hes got
heaps of money and I havent a cent Im going to ask him in no you
go they wont mind you

The folks wont like it began Nat

They wont know Daddy Bhaer is away and Mrs Bhaers busy with Ted
hes got croup or something and she cant leave him We shant sit up
late or make any noise so wheres the harm

Asia will know if we burn the lamp long she always does

No she wont Ive got a dark lantern on purpose it dont give much
light and we can shut it quick if we hear anyone coming said Dan

This idea struck Nat as a fine one and lent an air of romance to the
thing He started off to tell Tommy but put his head in again to say

You want Demi too dont you

No I dont the Deacon will rollup eyes and preach if you tell him He
will be asleep so just tip the wink to Tom and cut back again

Nat obeyed and returned in a minute with Tommy half dressed rather
tousled about the head and very sleepy but quite ready for fun as
usual

Now keep quiet and Ill show you how to play a firstrate game called
Poker said Dan as the three revellers gathered round the table on
which were set forth the bottle the cigar and the cards First well
all have a drink then well take a go at the weed and then well
play Thats the way men do and its jolly fun

The beer circulated in a mug and all three smacked their lips over it
though Nat and Tommy did not like the bitter stuff The cigar was worse
still but they dared not say so and each puffed away till he was dizzy
or choked when he passed the weed on to his neighbor Dan liked
it for it seemed like old times when he now and then had a chance
to imitate the low men who surrounded him He drank and smoked and
swaggered as much like them as he could and getting into the spirit
of the part he assumed he soon began to swear under his breath for
fear some one should hear him You mustnt its wicked to say Damn
cried Tommy who had followed his leader so far

Oh hang dont you preach but play away its part of the fun to
swear

Id rather say thunder turtles said Tommy who had composed this
interesting exclamation and was very proud of it

And Ill say The Devil that sounds well added Nat much impressed
by Dans manly ways

Dan scoffed at their nonsense and swore stoutly as he tried to teach
them the new game

But Tommy was very sleepy and Nats head began to ache with the beer
and the smoke so neither of them was very quick to learn and the game
dragged The room was nearly dark for the lantern burned badly they
could not laugh loud nor move about much for Silas slept next door in
the shedchamber and altogether the party was dull In the middle of a
deal Dan stopped suddenly and called out Whos that in a startled
tone and at the same moment drew the slide over the light A voice in
the darkness said tremulously I cant find Tommy and then there was
the quick patter of bare feet running away down the entry that led from
the wing to the main house

Its Demi hes gone to call some one cut into bed Tom and dont
tell cried Dan whisking all signs of the revel out of sight and
beginning to tear off his clothes while Nat did the same

Tommy flew to his room and dived into bed where he lay laughing
till something burned his hand when he discovered that he was still
clutching the stump of the festive cigar which he happened to be
smoking when the revel broke up

It was nearly out and he was about to extinguish it carefully when
Nurseys voice was heard and fearing it would betray him if he hid it
in the bed he threw it underneath after a final pinch which he thought
finished it

Nursey came in with Demi who looked much amazed to see the red face of
Tommy reposing peacefully upon his pillow

He wasnt there just now because I woke up and could not find him
anywhere said Demi pouncing on him

What mischief are you at now bad child asked Nursey with a
goodnatured shake which made the sleeper open his eyes to say meekly

I only ran into Nats room to see him about something Go away and let
me alone Im awful sleepy

Nursey tucked Demi in and went off to reconnoitre but only found two
boys slumbering peacefully in Dans room Some little frolic she
thought and as there was no harm done she said nothing to Mrs Bhaer
who was busy and worried over little Teddy

Tommy was sleepy and telling Demi to mind his own business and not ask
questions he was snoring in ten minutes little dreaming what was going
on under his bed The cigar did not go out but smouldered away on the
straw carpet till it was nicely on fire and a hungry little flame went
creeping along till the dimity bedcover caught then the sheets and
then the bed itself The beer made Tommy sleep heavily and the smoke
stupified Demi so they slept on till the fire began to scorch them and
they were in danger of being burned to death

Franz was sitting up to study and as he left the schoolroom he smelt
the smoke dashed upstairs and saw it coming in a cloud from the left
wing of the house Without stopping to call any one he ran into the
room dragged the boys from the blazing bed and splashed all the water
he could find at hand on to the flames It checked but did not quench
the fire and the children wakened on being tumbled topsyturvy into
a cold hall began to roar at the top of their voices Mrs Bhaer
instantly appeared and a minute after Silas burst out of his room
shouting Fire in a tone that raised the whole house A flock of
white goblins with scared faces crowded into the hall and for a minute
every one was panicstricken

Then Mrs Bhaer found her wits bade Nursey see to the burnt boys and
sent Franz and Silas downstairs for some tubs of wet clothes which
she flung on the bed over the carpet and up against the curtains now
burning finely and threatening to kindle the walls

Most of the boys stood dumbly looking on but Dan and Emil worked
bravely running to and fro with water from the bathroom and helping
to pull down the dangerous curtains

The peril was soon over and ordering the boys all back to bed and
leaving Silas to watch lest the fire broke out again Mrs Bhaer and
Franz went to see how the poor boys got on Demi had escaped with one
burn and a grand scare but Tommy had not only most of his hair scorched
off his head but a great burn on his arm that made him half crazy with
the pain Demi was soon made cosy and Franz took him away to his own
bed where the kind lad soothed his fright and hummed him to sleep as
cosily as a woman Nursey watched over poor Tommy all night trying to
ease his misery and Mrs Bhaer vibrated between him and little Teddy
with oil and cotton paregoric and squills saying to herself from time
to time as if she found great amusement in the thought I always knew
Tommy would set the house on fire and now he has done it

When Mr Bhaer got home next morning he found a nice state of things
Tommy in bed Teddy wheezing like a little grampus Mrs Jo quite used
up and the whole flock of boys so excited that they all talked at once
and almost dragged him by main force to view the ruins Under his quiet
management things soon fell into order for every one felt that he was
equal to a dozen conflagrations and worked with a will at whatever task
he gave them

There was no school that morning but by afternoon the damaged room was
put to rights the invalids were better and there was time to hear and
judge the little culprits quietly Nat and Tommy told their parts in the
mischief and were honestly sorry for the danger they had brought to the
dear old house and all in it But Dan put on his devilmaycare look
and would not own that there was much harm done

Now of all things Mr Bhaer hated drinking gambling and swearing
smoking he had given up that the lads might not be tempted to try it
and it grieved and angered him deeply to find that the boy with whom he
had tried to be most forbearing should take advantage of his absence to
introduce these forbidden vices and teach his innocent little lads
to think it manly and pleasant to indulge in them He talked long and
earnestly to the assembled boys and ended by saying with an air of
mingled firmness and regret

I think Tommy is punished enough and that scar on his arm will remind
him for a long time to let these things alone Nats fright will do for
him for he is really sorry and does try to obey me But you Dan have
been many times forgiven and yet it does no good I cannot have my boys
hurt by your bad example nor my time wasted in talking to deaf ears so
you can say goodbye to them all and tell Nursey to put up your things
in my little black bag

Oh sir where is he going cried Nat

To a pleasant place up in the country where I sometimes send boys when
they dont do well here Mr Page is a kind man and Dan will be happy
there if he chooses to do his best

Will he ever come back asked Demi

That will depend on himself I hope so

As he spoke Mr Bhaer left the room to write his letter to Mr Page
and the boys crowded round Dan very much as people do about a man who is
going on a long and perilous journey to unknown regions

I wonder if youll like it began Jack

Shant stay if I dont said Dan coolly

Where will you go asked Nat

I may go to sea or out west or take a look at California answered
Dan with a reckless air that quite took away the breath of the little
boys

Oh dont stay with Mr Page awhile and then come back here do Dan
pleaded Nat much affected at the whole affair

I dont care where I go or how long I stay and Ill be hanged if I
ever come back here with which wrathful speech Dan went away to put up
his things every one of which Mr Bhaer had given him

That was the only goodbye he gave the boys for they were all talking
the matter over in the barn when he came down and he told Nat not to
call them The wagon stood at the door and Mrs Bhaer came out to speak
to Dan looking so sad that his heart smote him and he said in a low
tone

May I say goodbye to Teddy

Yes dear go in and kiss him he will miss his Danny very much

No one saw the look in Dans eyes as he stooped over the crib and saw
the little face light up at first sight of him but he heard Mrs Bhaer
say pleadingly

Cant we give the poor lad one more trial Fritz and Mr Bhaer answer
in his steady way

My dear it is not best so let him go where he can do no harm to
others while they do good to him and by and by he shall come back I
promise you

Hes the only boy we ever failed with and I am so grieved for I
thought there was the making of a fine man in him spite of his faults

Dan heard Mrs Bhaer sigh and he wanted to ask for one more trial
himself but his pride would not let him and he came out with the hard
look on his face shook hands without a word and drove away with Mr
Bhaer leaving Nat and Mrs Jo to look after him with tears in their
eyes

A few days afterwards they received a letter from Mr Page saying that
Dan was doing well whereat they all rejoiced But three weeks later
came another letter saying that Dan had run away and nothing had been
heard of him whereat they all looked sober and Mr Bhaer said

Perhaps I ought to have given him another chance

Mrs Bhaer however nodded wisely and answered Dont be troubled
Fritz the boy will come back to us Im sure of it

But time went on and no Dan came



CHAPTER VII NAUGHTY NAN

Fritz Ive got a new idea cried Mrs Bhaer as she met her husband
one day after school

Well my dear what is it and he waited willingly to hear the new
plan for some of Mrs Jos ideas were so droll it was impossible to
help laughing at them though usually they were quite sensible and he
was glad to carry them out

Daisy needs a companion and the boys would be all the better for
another girl among them you know we believe in bringing up little men
and women together and it is high time we acted up to our belief They
pet and tyrannize over Daisy by turns and she is getting spoilt Then
they must learn gentle ways and improve their manners and having girls
about will do it better than any thing else

You are right as usual Now who shall we have asked Mr Bhaer
seeing by the look in her eye that Mrs Jo had some one all ready to
propose

Little Annie Harding

What Naughty Nan as the lads call her cried Mr Bhaer looking very
much amused

Yes she is running wild at home since her mother died and is too
bright a child to be spoilt by servants I have had my eye on her for
some time and when I met her father in town the other day I asked him
why he did not send her to school He said he would gladly if he could
find as good a school for girls as ours was for boys I know he would
rejoice to have her come so suppose we drive over this afternoon and
see about it

Have not you cares enough now my Jo without this little gypsy to
torment you asked Mr Bhaer patting the hand that lay on his arm

Oh dear no said Mother Bhaer briskly I like it and never was
happier than since I had my wilderness of boys You see Fritz I feel a
great sympathy for Nan because I was such a naughty child myself that
I know all about it She is full of spirits and only needs to be taught
what to do with them to be as nice a little girl as Daisy Those quick
wits of hers would enjoy lessons if they were rightly directed and what
is now a tricksy midget would soon become a busy happy child I know
how to manage her for I remember how my blessed mother managed me
and

And if you succeed half as well as she did you will have done a
magnificent work interrupted Mr Bhaer who labored under the delusion
that Mrs B was the best and most charming woman alive

Now if you make fun of my plan Ill give you bad coffee for a week
and then where are you sir cried Mrs Jo tweaking him by the ear
just as if he was one of the boys

Wont Daisys hair stand erect with horror at Nans wild ways asked
Mr Bhaer presently when Teddy had swarmed up his waistcoat and Rob
up his back for they always flew at their father the minute school was
done

At first perhaps but it will do Posy good She is getting prim and
Bettyish and needs stirring up a bit She always has a good time when
Nan comes over to play and the two will help each other without knowing
it Dear me half the science of teaching is knowing how much children
do for one another and when to mix them

I only hope she wont turn out another firebrand

My poor Dan I never can quite forgive myself for letting him go
sighed Mrs Bhaer

At the sound of the name little Teddy who had never forgotten his
friend struggled down from his fathers arms and trotted to the door
looked out over the sunny lawn with a wistful face and then trotted
back again saying as he always did when disappointed of the longedfor
sight

My Dannys tummin soon

I really think we ought to have kept him if only for Teddys sake he
was so fond of him and perhaps babys love would have done for him what
we failed to do

Ive sometimes felt that myself but after keeping the boys in a
ferment and nearly burning up the whole family I thought it safer to
remove the firebrand for a time at least said Mr Bhaer

Dinners ready let me ring the bell and Rob began a solo upon that
instrument which made it impossible to hear ones self speak

Then I may have Nan may I asked Mrs Jo

A dozen Nans if you want them my dear answered Mr Bhaer who had
room in his fatherly heart for all the naughty neglected children in the
world

When Mrs Bhaer returned from her drive that afternoon before she could
unpack the load of little boys without whom she seldom moved a small
girl of ten skipped out at the back of the carryall and ran into the
house shouting

Hi Daisy where are you

Daisy came and looked pleased to see her guest but also a trifle
alarmed when Nan said still prancing as if it was impossible to keep
still

Im going to stay here always papa says I may and my box is coming
tomorrow all my things had to be washed and mended and your aunt came
and carried me off Isnt it great fun

Why yes Did you bring your big doll asked Daisy hoping she had
for on the last visit Nan had ravaged the baby house and insisted on
washing Blanche Matildas plaster face which spoilt the poor dears
complexion for ever

Yes shes somewhere round returned Nan with most unmaternal
carelessness I made you a ring coming along and pulled the hairs out
of Dobbins tail Dont you want it and Nan presented a horsehair
ring in token of friendship as they had both vowed they would never
speak to one another again when they last parted

Won by the beauty of the offering Daisy grew more cordial and proposed
retiring to the nursery but Nan said No I want to see the boys and
the barn and ran off swinging her hat by one string till it broke
when she left it to its fate on the grass

Hullo Nan cried the boys as she bounced in among them with the
announcement

Im going to stay

Hooray bawled Tommy from the wall on which he was perched for Nan
was a kindred spirit and he foresaw larks in the future

I can bat let me play said Nan who could turn her hand to any
thing and did not mind hard knocks

We aint playing now and our side beat without you

I can beat you in running any way returned Nan falling back on her
strong point

Can she asked Nat of Jack

She runs very well for a girl answered Jack who looked down upon Nan
with condescending approval

Will you try said Nan longing to display her powers

Its too hot and Tommy languished against the wall as if quite
exhausted

Whats the matter with Stuffy asked Nan whose quick eyes were roving
from face to face

Ball hurt his hand he howls at every thing answered Jack scornfully

I dont I never cry no matter how Im hurt its babyish said Nan
loftily

Pooh I could make you cry in two minutes returned Stuffy rousing
up

See if you can

Go and pick that bunch of nettles then and Stuffy pointed to a
sturdy specimen of that prickly plant growing by the wall

Nan instantly grasped the nettle pulled it up and held it with a
defiant gesture in spite of the almost unbearable sting

Good for you cried the boys quick to acknowledge courage even in one
of the weaker sex

More nettled than she was Stuffy determined to get a cry out of her
somehow and he said tauntingly You are used to poking your hands into
every thing so that isnt fair Now go and bump your head real hard
against the barn and see if you dont howl then

Dont do it said Nat who hated cruelty

But Nan was off and running straight at the barn she gave her head a
blow that knocked her flat and sounded like a batteringram Dizzy but
undaunted she staggered up saying stoutly though her face was drawn
with pain

That hurt but I dont cry

Do it again said Stuffy angrily and Nan would have done it but Nat
held her and Tommy forgetting the heat flew at Stuffy like a little
gamecock roaring out

Stop it or Ill throw you over the barn and so shook and hustled
poor Stuffy that for a minute he did not know whether he was on his head
or his heels

She told me to was all he could say when Tommy let him alone

Never mind if she did it is awfully mean to hurt a little girl said
Demi reproachfully

Ho I dont mind I aint a little girl Im older than you and Daisy
so now cried Nan ungratefully

Dont preach Deacon you bully Posy every day of your life called
out the Commodore who just then hove in sight

I dont hurt her do I Daisy and Demi turned to his sister who was
pooring Nans tingling hands and recommending water for the purple
lump rapidly developing itself on her forehead

You are the best boy in the world promptly answered Daisy adding
as truth compelled her to do You hurt me sometimes but you dont mean
to

Put away the bats and things and mind what you are about my hearties
No fighting allowed aboard this ship said Emil who rather lorded it
over the others

How do you do Madge Wildfire said Mr Bhaer as Nan came in with
the rest to supper Give the right hand little daughter and mind thy
manners he added as Nan offered him her left

The other hurts me

The poor little hand what has it been doing to get those blisters he
asked drawing it from behind her back where she had put it with a look
which made him think she had been in mischief

Before Nan could think of any excuse Daisy burst out with the whole
story during which Stuffy tried to hide his face in a bowl of bread and
milk When the tale was finished Mr Bhaer looked down the long table
towards his wife and said with a laugh in his eyes

This rather belongs to your side of the house so I wont meddle with
it my dear

Mrs Jo knew what he meant but she liked her little black sheep all the
better for her pluck though she only said in her soberest way

Do you know why I asked Nan to come here

To plague me muttered Stuffy with his mouth full

To help make little gentlemen of you and I think you have shown that
some of you need it

Here Stuffy retired into his bowl again and did not emerge till Demi
made them all laugh by saying in his slow wondering way

How can she when shes such a tomboy

Thats just it she needs help as much as you and I expect you set her
an example of good manners

Is she going to be a little gentleman too asked Rob

Shed like it wouldnt you Nan added Tommy

No I shouldnt I hate boys said Nan fiercely for her hand still
smarted and she began to think that she might have shown her courage in
some wiser way

I am sorry you hate my boys because they can be wellmannered and
most agreeable when they choose Kindness in looks and words and ways is
true politeness and any one can have it if they only try to treat other
people as they like to be treated themselves

Mrs Bhaer had addressed herself to Nan but the boys nudged one
another and appeared to take the hint for that time at least and
passed the butter said please and thank you yes sir and no
maam with unusual elegance and respect Nan said nothing but kept
herself quiet and refrained from tickling Demi though strongly tempted
to do so because of the dignified airs he put on She also appeared
to have forgotten her hatred of boys and played I spy with them till
dark Stuffy was observed to offer her frequent sucks on his candyball
during the game which evidently sweetened her temper for the last
thing she said on going to bed was

When my battledore and shuttlecock comes Ill let you all play with
em

Her first remark in the morning was Has my box come and when told
that it would arrive sometime during the day she fretted and fumed and
whipped her doll till Daisy was shocked She managed to exist however
till five oclock when she disappeared and was not missed till
suppertime because those at home thought she had gone to the hill with
Tommy and Demi

I saw her going down the avenue alone as hard as she could pelt
said Mary Ann coming in with the hastypudding and finding every one
asking Where is Nan

She has run home little gypsy cried Mrs Bhaer looking anxious

Perhaps she has gone to the station to look after her luggage
suggested Franz

That is impossible she does not know the way and if she found it she
could never carry the box a mile said Mrs Bhaer beginning to think
that her new idea might be rather a hard one to carry out

It would be like her and Mr Bhaer caught up his hat to go and find
the child when a shout from Jack who was at the window made everyone
hurry to the door

There was Miss Nan to be sure tugging along a very large bandbox tied
up in linen bag Very hot and dusty and tired did she look but marched
stoutly along and came puffing up to the steps where she dropped
her load with a sigh of relief and sat down upon it observed as she
crossed her tired arms

I couldnt wait any longer so I went and got it

But you did not know the way said Tommy while the rest stood round
enjoying the joke

Oh I found it I never get lost

Its a mile how could you go so far

Well it was pretty far but I rested a good deal

Wasnt that thing very heavy

Its so round I couldnt get hold of it good and I thought my arms
would break right off

I dont see how the stationmaster let you have it said Tommy

I didnt say anything to him He was in the little ticket place and
didnt see me so I just took it off the platform

Run down and tell him it is all right Franz or old Dodd will think
it is stolen said Mr Bhaer joining in the shout of laughter at Nans
coolness

I told you we would send for it if it did not come Another time you
must wait for you will get into trouble if you run away Promise me
this or I shall not dare to trust you out of my sight said Mrs
Bhaer wiping the dust off Nans little hot face

Well I wont only papa tells me not to put off doing things so I
dont

That is rather a poser I think you had better give her some supper
now and a private lecture by and by said Mr Bhaer too much amused
to be angry at the young ladys exploit

The boys thought it great fun and Nan entertained them all
suppertime with an account of her adventures for a big dog had barked
at her a man had laughed at her a woman had given her a doughnut and
her hat had fallen into the brook when she stopped to drink exhausted
with her exertion

I fancy you will have your hands full now my dear Tommy and Nan are
quite enough for one woman said Mr Bhaer half an hour later

I know it will take some time to tame the child but she is such a
generous warmhearted little thing I should love her even if she were
twice as naughty answered Mrs Jo pointing to the merry group in
the middle of which stood Nan giving away her things right and left as
lavishly as if the big bandbox had no bottom

It was those good traits that soon made little Giddygaddy as they
called her a favorite with every one Daisy never complained of being
dull again for Nan invented the most delightful plays and her pranks
rivalled Tommys to the amusement of the whole school She buried her
big doll and forgot it for a week and found it well mildewed when she
dragged it up Daisy was in despair but Nan took it to the painter who
as at work about the house got him to paint it brick red with staring
black eyes then she dressed it up with feathers and scarlet flannel
and one of Neds leaden hatchets and in the character of an Indian
chief the late Poppydilla tomahawked all the other dolls and caused
the nursery to run red with imaginary gore She gave away her new shoes
to a beggar child hoping to be allowed to go barefoot but found it
impossible to combine charity and comfort and was ordered to ask leave
before disposing of her clothes She delighted the boys by making a
fireship out of a shingle with two large sails wet with turpentine
which she lighted and then sent the little vessel floating down the
brook at dusk She harnessed the old turkeycock to a straw wagon and
made him trot round the house at a tremendous pace She gave her coral
necklace for four unhappy kittens which had been tormented by some
heartless lads and tended them for days as gently as a mother dressing
their wounds with cold cream feeding them with a dolls spoon and
mourning over them when they died till she was consoled by one of
Demis best turtles She made Silas tattoo an anchor on her arm like
his and begged hard to have a blue star on each cheek but he dared not
do it though she coaxed and scolded till the softhearted fellow longed
to give in She rode every animal on the place from the big horse Andy
to the cross pig from whom she was rescued with difficulty Whatever
the boys dared her to do she instantly attempted no matter how
dangerous it might be and they were never tired of testing her courage

Mr Bhaer suggested that they should see who would study best and Nan
found as much pleasure in using her quick wits and fine memory as her
active feet and merry tongue while the lads had to do their best to
keep their places for Nan showed them that girls could do most things
as well as boys and some things better There were no rewards in
school but Mr Bhaers Well done and Mrs Bhaers good report on the
conscience book taught them to love duty for its own sake and try to
do it faithfully sure sooner or later the recompense would come Little
Nan was quick to feel the new atmosphere to enjoy it to show that it
was what she needed for this little garden was full of sweet flowers
half hidden by the weeds and when kind hands gently began to
cultivate it all sorts of green shoots sprung up promising to blossom
beautifully in the warmth of love and care the best climate for young
hearts and souls all the world over



CHAPTER VIII PRANKS AND PLAYS

As there is no particular plan to this story except to describe a few
scenes in the life at Plumfield for the amusement of certain little
persons we will gently ramble along in this chapter and tell some of
the pastimes of Mrs Jos boys I beg leave to assure my honored readers
that most of the incidents are taken from real life and that the oddest
are the truest for no person no matter how vivid an imagination he may
have can invent anything half so droll as the freaks and fancies that
originate in the lively brains of little people

Daisy and Demi were full of these whims and lived in a world of their
own peopled with lovely or grotesque creatures to whom they gave the
queerest names and with whom they played the queerest games One of
these nursery inventions was an invisible sprite called The Naughty
Kittymouse whom the children had believed in feared and served for
a long time They seldom spoke of it to any one else kept their rites
as private as possible and as they never tried to describe it even to
themselves this being had a vague mysterious charm very agreeable
to Demi who delighted in elves and goblins A most whimsical and
tyrannical imp was the Naughty Kittymouse and Daisy found a fearful
pleasure in its service blindly obeying its most absurd demands which
were usually proclaimed from the lips of Demi whose powers of invention
were great Rob and Teddy sometimes joined in these ceremonies and
considered them excellent fun although they did not understand half
that went on

One day after school Demi whispered to his sister with an ominous wag
of the head

The Kittymouse wants us this afternoon

What for asked Daisy anxiously

A sackerryfice answered Demi solemnly There must be a fire behind
the big rock at two oclock and we must all bring the things we like
best and burn them he added with an awful emphasis on the last
words

Oh dear I love the new paper dollies Aunt Amy painted for me best
of any thing must I burn them up cried Daisy who never thought of
denying the unseen tyrant any thing it demanded

Every one I shall burn my boat my best scrapbook and all my
soldiers said Demi firmly

Well I will but its too bad of Kittymouse to want our very nicest
things sighed Daisy

A sackerryfice means to give up what you are fond of so we must
explained Demi to whom the new idea had been suggested by hearing
Uncle Fritz describe the customs of the Greeks to the big boys who were
reading about them in school

Is Rob coming too asked Daisy

Yes and he is going to bring his toy village it is all made of wood
you know and will burn nicely Well have a grand bonfire and see them
blaze up wont we

This brilliant prospect consoled Daisy and she ate her dinner with a
row of paper dolls before her as a sort of farewell banquet

At the appointed hour the sacrificial train set forth each child
bearing the treasures demanded by the insatiable Kittymouse Teddy
insisted on going also and seeing that all the others had toys he
tucked a squeaking lamb under one arm and old Annabella under the
other little dreaming what anguish the latter idol was to give him

Where are you going my chickens asked Mrs Jo as the flock passed
her door

To play by the big rock cant we

Yes only dont do near the pond and take good care of baby

I always do said Daisy leading forth her charge with a capable air

Now you must all sit round and not move till I tell you This flat
stone is an altar and I am going to make a fire on it

Demi then proceeded to kindle up a small blaze as he had seen the boys
do at picnics When the flame burned well he ordered the company to
march round it three times and then stand in a circle

I shall begin and as fast as my things are burnt you must bring
yours

With that he solemnly laid on a little paper book full of pictures
pasted in by himself this was followed by a dilapidated boat and
then one by one the unhappy leaden soldiers marched to death Not one
faltered or hung back from the splendid red and yellow captain to the
small drummer who had lost his legs all vanished in the flames and
mingled in one common pool of melted lead

Now Daisy called the high priest of Kittymouse when his rich
offerings had been consumed to the great satisfaction of the children

My dear dollies how can I let them go moaned Daisy hugging the
entire dozen with a face full of maternal woe

You must commanded Demi and with a farewell kiss to each Daisy laid
her blooming dolls upon the coals

Let me keep one the dear blue thing she is so sweet besought the
poor little mamma clutching her last in despair

More more growled an awful voice and Demi cried thats the
Kittymouse she must have every one quick or she will scratch us

In went the precious blue belle flounces rosy hat and all and
nothing but a few black flakes remained of that bright band

Stand the houses and trees round and let them catch themselves it
will be like a real fire then said Demi who liked variety even in his
sackerryfices

Charmed by this suggestion the children arranged the doomed village
laid a line of coals along the main street and then sat down to watch
the conflagration It was somewhat slow to kindle owing to the paint
but at last one ambitious little cottage blazed up fired a tree of the
palm species which fell on to the roof of a large family mansion
and in a few minutes the whole town was burning merrily The wooden
population stood and stared at the destruction like blockheads as they
were till they also caught and blazed away without a cry It took
some time to reduce the town to ashes and the lookerson enjoyed the
spectacle immensely cheering as each house fell dancing like wild
Indians when the steeple flamed aloft and actually casting one wretched
little churnshaped lady who had escaped to the suburbs into the very
heart of the fire

The superb success of this last offering excited Teddy to such a degree
that he first threw his lamb into the conflagration and before it had
time even to roast he planted poor Annabella on the funeral pyre Of
course she did not like it and expressed her anguish and resentment in
a way that terrified her infant destroyer Being covered with kid
she did not blaze but did what was worse she squirmed First one leg
curled up then the other in a very awful and lifelike manner next
she flung her arms over her head as if in great agony her head itself
turned on her shoulders her glass eyes fell out and with one final
writhe of her whole body she sank down a blackened mass on the ruins
of the town This unexpected demonstration startled every one and
frightened Teddy half out of his little wits He looked then screamed
and fled toward the house roaring Marmar at the top of his voice

Mrs Bhaer heard the outcry and ran to the rescue but Teddy could only
cling to her and pour out in his broken way something about poor Bella
hurted a dreat fire and all the dollies dorn Fearing some dire
mishap his mother caught him up and hurried to the scene of action
where she found the blind worshippers of Kittymouse mourning over the
charred remains of the lost darling

What have you been at Tell me all about it said Mrs Jo composing
herself to listen patiently for the culprits looked so penitent she
forgave them beforehand

With some reluctance Demi explained their play and Aunt Jo laughed till
the tears ran down her cheeks the children were so solemn and the play
was so absurd

I thought you were too sensible to play such a silly game as this If
I had any Kittymouse Id have a good one who liked you to play in safe
pleasant ways and not destroy and frighten Just see what a ruin you
have made all Daisys pretty dolls Demis soldiers and Robs new
village beside poor Teddys pet lamb and dear old Annabella I shall
have to write up in the nursery the verse that used to come in the boxes
of toys

 The children of Holland take pleasure in making
 What the children of Boston take pleasure in breaking

Only I shall put Plumfield instead of Boston

We never will again truly truly cried the repentant little sinners
much abashed at this reproof

Demi told us to said Rob

Well I heard Uncle tell about the Greece people who had altars
and things and so I wanted to be like them only I hadnt any live
creatures to sackerryfice so we burnt up our toys

Dear me that is something like the bean story said Aunt Jo laughing
again

Tell about it suggested Daisy to change the subject

Once there was a poor woman who had three or four little children and
she used to lock them up in her room when she went out to work to keep
them safe On day when she was going away she said Now my dears
dont let baby fall out of window dont play with the matches and
dont put beans up your noses Now the children had never dreamed of
doing that last thing but she put it into their heads and the minute
she was gone they ran and stuffed their naughty little noses full of
beans just to see how it felt and she found them all crying when she
came home

Did it hurt asked Rob with such intense interest that his mother
hastily added a warning sequel lest a new edition of the bean story
should appear in her own family

Very much as I know for when my mother told me this story I was so
silly that I went and tried it myself I had no beans so I took some
little pebbles and poked several into my nose I did not like it at
all and wanted to take them out again very soon but one would not
come and I was so ashamed to tell what a goose I been that I went for
hours with the stone hurting me very much At last the pain got so bad
I had to tell and when my mother could not get it out the doctor came
Then I was put in a chair and held tight Rob while he used his ugly
little pincers till the stone hopped out Dear me how my wretched
little nose did ache and how people laughed at me and Mrs Jo shook
her head in a dismal way as if the memory of her sufferings was too
much for her

Rob looked deeply impressed and I am glad to say took the warning to
heart Demi proposed that they should bury poor Annabella and in the
interest of the funeral Teddy forgot his fright Daisy was soon consoled
by another batch of dolls from Aunt Amy and the Naughty Kittymouse
seemed to be appeased by the last offerings for she tormented them no
more

Brops was the name of a new and absorbing play invented by Bangs
As this interesting animal is not to be found in any Zoological Garden
unless Du Chaillu has recently brought one from the wilds of Africa I
will mention a few of its peculiar habits and traits for the benefit of
inquiring minds The Brop is a winged quadruped with a human face of
a youthful and merry aspect When it walks the earth it grunts when it
soars it gives a shrill hoot occasionally it goes erect and talks good
English Its body is usually covered with a substance much resembling a
shawl sometimes red sometimes blue often plaid and strange to say
they frequently change skins with one another On their heads they have
a horn very like a stiff brown paper lamplighter Wings of the same
substance flap upon their shoulders when they fly this is never very
far from the ground as they usually fall with violence if they attempt
any lofty flights They browse over the earth but can sit up and eat
like the squirrel Their favorite nourishment is the seedcake apples
also are freely taken and sometimes raw carrots are nibbled when food
is scarce They live in dens where they have a sort of nest much like
a clothesbasket in which the little Brops play till their wings are
grown These singular animals quarrel at times and it is on these
occasions that they burst into human speech call each other names cry
scold and sometimes tear off horns and skin declaring fiercely that
they wont play The few privileged persons who have studied them are
inclined to think them a remarkable mixture of the monkey the sphinx
the roc and the queer creatures seen by the famous Peter Wilkins

This game was a great favorite and the younger children beguiled many
a rainy afternoon flapping or creeping about the nursery acting like
little bedlamites and being as merry as little grigs To be sure it was
rather hard upon clothes particularly trouserknees and jacketelbows
but Mrs Bhaer only said as she patched and darned

We do things just as foolish and not half so harmless If I could
get as much happiness out of it as the little dears do Id be a Brop
myself

Nats favorite amusements were working in his garden and sitting in the
willowtree with his violin for that green nest was a fairy world to
him and there he loved to perch making music like a happy bird The
lads called him Old Chirper because he was always humming whistling
or fiddling and they often stopped a minute in their work or play to
listen to the soft tones of the violin which seemed to lead a little
orchestra of summer sounds The birds appeared to regard him as one of
themselves and fearlessly sat on the fence or lit among the boughs to
watch him with their quick bright eyes The robins in the appletree
near by evidently considered him a friend for the father bird hunted
insects close beside him and the little mother brooded as confidingly
over her blue eggs as if the boy was only a new sort of blackbird who
cheered her patient watch with his song The brown brook babbled and
sparkled below him the bees haunted the clover fields on either side
friendly faces peeped at him as they passed the old house stretched its
wide wings hospitably toward him and with a blessed sense of rest and
love and happiness Nat dreamed for hours in this nook unconscious what
healthful miracles were being wrought upon him

One listener he had who never tired and to whom he was more than a
mere schoolmate Poor Billys chief delight was to lie beside the brook
watching leaves and bits of foam dance by listening dreamily to the
music in the willowtree He seemed to think Nat a sort of angel who sat
aloft and sang for a few baby memories still lingered in his mind and
seemed to grow brighter at these times Seeing the interest he took in
Nat Mr Bhaer begged him to help them lift the cloud from the feeble
brain by this gentle spell Glad to do any thing to show his gratitude
Nat always smiled on Billy when he followed him about and let him
listen undisturbed to the music which seemed to speak a language he
could understand Help one another was a favorite Plumfield motto
and Nat learned how much sweetness is added to life by trying to live up
to it

Jack Fords peculiar pastime was buying and selling and he bid fair
to follow in the footsteps of his uncle a country merchant who sold
a little of every thing and made money fast Jack had seen the sugar
sanded the molasses watered the butter mixed with lard and things of
that kind and labored under the delusion that it was all a proper part
of the business His stock in trade was of a different sort but he made
as much as he could out of every worm he sold and always got the
best of the bargain when he traded with the boys for string knives
fishhooks or whatever the article might be The boys who all had
nicknames called him Skinflint but Jack did not care as long as the
old tobaccopouch in which he kept his money grew heavier and heavier

He established a sort of auctionroom and now and then sold off all the
odds and ends he had collected or helped the lads exchange things with
one another He got bats balls hockeysticks etc cheap from one
set of mates furbished them up and let them for a few cents a time to
another set often extending his business beyond the gates of Plumfield
in spite of the rules Mr Bhaer put a stop to some of his speculations
and tried to give him a better idea of business talent than mere
sharpness in overreaching his neighbors Now and then Jack made a bad
bargain and felt worse about it than about any failure in lessons or
conduct and took his revenge on the next innocent customer who came
along His accountbook was a curiosity and his quickness at figures
quite remarkable Mr Bhaer praised him for this and tried to make his
sense of honesty and honor as quick and by and by when Jack found
that he could not get on without these virtues he owned that his
teacher was right

Cricket and football the boys had of course but after the stirring
accounts of these games in the immortal Tom Brown at Rugby no feeble
female pen may venture to do more than respectfully allude to them

Emil spent his holidays on the river or the pond and drilled the elder
lads for a race with certain town boys who now and then invaded
their territory The race duly came off but as it ended in a general
shipwreck it was not mentioned in public and the Commodore had serious
thoughts of retiring to a desert island so disgusted was he with his
kind for a time No desert island being convenient he was forced
to remain among his friends and found consolation in building a
boathouse

The little girls indulged in the usual plays of their age improving
upon them somewhat as their lively fancies suggested The chief and
most absorbing play was called Mrs Shakespeare Smith the name
was provided by Aunt Jo but the trials of the poor lady were quite
original Daisy was Mrs S S and Nan by turns her daughter or a
neighbor Mrs Giddygaddy

No pen can describe the adventures of these ladies for in one short
afternoon their family was the scene of births marriages deaths
floods earthquakes teaparties and balloon ascensions Millions of
miles did these energetic women travel dressed in hats and habits never
seen before by mortal eye perched on the bed driving the posts like
mettlesome steeds and bouncing up and down till their heads spun Fits
and fires were the pet afflictions with a general massacre now and then
by way of change Nan was never tired of inventing fresh combinations
and Daisy followed her leader with blind admiration Poor Teddy was a
frequent victim and was often rescued from real danger for the excited
ladies were apt to forget that he was not of the same stuff their
longsuffering dolls Once he was shut into the closet for a dungeon and
forgotten by the girls who ran off to some outofdoor game Another
time he was half drowned in the bathtub playing be a cunning little
whale And worst of all he was cut down just in time after being hung
up for a robber

But the institution most patronized by all was the Club It had no other
name and it needed none being the only one in the neighborhood The
elder lads got it up and the younger were occasionally admitted if
they behaved well Tommy and Demi were honorary members but were always
obliged to retire unpleasantly early owing to circumstances over
which they had no control The proceedings of this club were somewhat
peculiar for it met at all sorts of places and hours had all manner
of queer ceremonies and amusements and now and then was broken up
tempestuously only to be reestablished however on a firmer basis

Rainy evenings the members met in the schoolroom and passed the time in
games chess morris backgammon fencing matches recitations debates
or dramatic performances of a darkly tragical nature In summer the barn
was the rendezvous and what went on there no uninitiated mortal
knows On sultry evenings the Club adjourned to the brook for aquatic
exercises and the members sat about in airy attire froglike and cool
On such occasions the speeches were unusually eloquent quite flowing
as one might say and if any orators remarks displeased the audience
cold water was thrown upon him till his ardor was effectually quenched
Franz was president and maintained order admirably considering the
unruly nature of the members Mr Bhaer never interfered with their
affairs and was rewarded for this wise forbearance by being invited now
and then to behold the mysteries unveiled which he appeared to enjoy
much

When Nan came she wished to join the Club and caused great excitement
and division among the gentlemen by presenting endless petitions both
written and spoken disturbing their solemnities by insulting them
through the keyhole performing vigorous solos on the door and
writing up derisive remarks on walls and fences for she belonged to
the Irrepressibles Finding these appeals in vain the girls by the
advice of Mrs Jo got up an institution of their own which they called
the Cosy Club To this they magnanimously invited the gentlemen whose
youth excluded them from the other one and entertained these favored
beings so well with little suppers new games devised by Nan and other
pleasing festivities that one by one the elder boys confessed a
desire to partake of these more elegant enjoyments and after much
consultation finally decided to propose an interchange of civilities

The members of the Cosy Club were invited to adorn the rival
establishment on certain evenings and to the surprise of the gentlemen
their presence was not found to be a restraint upon the conversation
or amusement of the regular frequenters which could not be said of all
Clubs I fancy The ladies responded handsomely and hospitably to these
overtures of peace and both institutions flourished long and happily



CHAPTER IX DAISYS BALL

Mrs Shakespeare Smith would like to have Mr John Brooke Mr Thomas
Bangs and Mr Nathaniel Blake to come to her ball at three oclock
today

PS Nat must bring his fiddle so we can dance and all the boys must
be good or they cannot have any of the nice things we have cooked

This elegant invitation would I fear have been declined but for the
hint given in the last line of the postscript

They have been cooking lots of goodies I smelt em Lets go said
Tommy

We neednt stay after the feast you know added Demi

I never went to a ball What do you have to do asked Nat

Oh we just play be men and sit round stiff and stupid like grownup
folks and dance to please the girls Then we eat up everything and
come away as soon as we can

I think I could do that said Nat after considering Tommys
description for a minute

Ill write and say well come and Demi despatched the following
gentlemanly reply

We will all come Please have lots to eat J B Esquire

Great was the anxiety of the ladies about their first ball because if
every thing went well they intended to give a dinnerparty to the chosen
few

Aunt Jo likes to have the boys play with us if they are not rough
so we must make them like our balls then they will do them good said
Daisy with her maternal air as she set the table and surveyed the
store of refreshments with an anxious eye

Demi and Nat will be good but Tommy will do something bad I know he
will replied Nan shaking her head over the little cakebasket which
she was arranging

Then I shall send him right home said Daisy with decision

People dont do so at parties it isnt proper

I shall never ask him any more

That would do Hed be sorry not to come to the dinnerball wouldnt
he

I guess he would well have the splendidest things ever seen wont
we Real soup with a ladle and a tureem she meant tureen and a little
bird for turkey and gravy and all kinds of nice vegytubbles Daisy
never could say vegetables properly and had given up trying

It is most three and we ought to dress said Nan who had arranged a
fine costume for the occasion and was anxious to wear it

I am the mother so I shant dress up much said Daisy putting on a
nightcap ornamented with a red bow one of her aunts long skirts and
a shawl a pair of spectacles and large pocket handkerchief completed
her toilette making a plump rosy little matron of her

Nan had a wreath of artificial flowers a pair of old pink slippers a
yellow scarf a green muslin skirt and a fan made of feathers from the
duster also as a last touch of elegance a smellingbottle without any
smell in it

I am the daughter so I rig up a good deal and I must sing and dance
and talk more than you do The mothers only get the tea and be proper
you know

A sudden very loud knock caused Miss Smith to fly into a chair and fan
herself violently while her mamma sat bolt upright on the sofa and
tried to look quite calm and proper Little Bess who was on a visit
acted the part of maid and opened the door saying with a smile Wart
in gemplemun its all weady

In honor of the occasion the boys wore high paper collars tall
black hats and gloves of every color and material for they were an
afterthought and not a boy among them had a perfect pair

Good day mum said Demi in a deep voice which was so hard to keep
up that his remarks had to be extremely brief

Every one shook hands and then sat down looking so funny yet so sober
that the gentlemen forgot their manners and rolled in their chairs with
laughter

Oh dont cried Mrs Smith much distressed

You cant ever come again if you act so added Miss Smith rapping Mr
Bangs with her bottle because he laughed loudest

I cant help it you look so like fury gasped Mr Bangs with most
uncourteous candor

So do you but I shouldnt be so rude as to say so He shant come to
the dinnerball shall he Daisy cried Nan indignantly

I think we had better dance now Did you bring your fiddle sir asked
Mrs Smith trying to preserve her polite composure

It is outside the door and Nat went to get it

Better have tea first proposed the unabashed Tommy winking openly
at Demi to remind him that the sooner the refreshments were secured the
sooner they could escape

No we never have supper first and if you dont dance well you wont
have any supper at all not one bit sir said Mrs Smith so sternly
that her wild guests saw she was not to be trifled with and grew
overwhelmingly civil all at once

I will take Mr Bangs and teach him the polka for he does not know it
fit to be seen added the hostess with a reproachful look that sobered
Tommy at once

Nat struck up and the ball opened with two couples who went
conscientiously through a somewhat varied dance The ladies did well
because they liked it but the gentlemen exerted themselves from more
selfish motives for each felt that he must earn his supper and labored
manfully toward that end When every one was out of breath they were
allowed to rest and indeed poor Mrs Smith needed it for her long
dress had tripped her up many times The little maid passed round
molasses and water in such small cups that one guest actually emptied
nine I refrain from mentioning his name because this mild beverage
affected him so much that he put cup and all into his mouth at the ninth
round and choked himself publicly

You must ask Nan to play and sing now said Daisy to her brother who
sat looking very much like an owl as he gravely regarded the festive
scene between his high collars

Give us a song mum said the obedient guest secretly wondering where
the piano was

Miss Smith sailed up to an old secretary which stood in the room
threw back the lid of the writingdesk and sitting down before it
accompanied herself with a vigor which made the old desk rattle as she
sang that new and lovely song beginning

 Gaily the troubadour
 Touched his guitar
 As he was hastening
 Home from the war

The gentlemen applauded so enthusiastically that she gave them Bounding
Billows Little BoPeep and other gems of song till they were
obliged to hint that they had had enough Grateful for the praises
bestowed upon her daughter Mrs Smith graciously announced

Now we will have tea Sit down carefully and dont grab

It was beautiful to see the air of pride with which the good lady did
the honors of her table and the calmness with which she bore the little
mishaps that occurred The best pie flew wildly on the floor when she
tried to cut it with a very dull knife the bread and butter vanished
with a rapidity calculated to dismay a housekeepers soul and worst of
all the custards were so soft that they had to be drunk up instead of
being eaten elegantly with the new tin spoons

I grieve to state that Miss Smith squabbled with the maid for the best
jumble which caused Bess to toss the whole dish into the air and burst
out crying amid a rain of falling cakes She was comforted by a seat at
the table and the sugarbowl to empty but during this flurry a large
plate of patties was mysteriously lost and could not be found They
were the chief ornament of the feast and Mrs Smith was indignant at
the loss for she had made them herself and they were beautiful to
behold I put it to any lady if it was not hard to have one dozen
delicious patties made of flour salt and water with a large raisin
in the middle of each and much sugar over the whole swept away at one
fell swoop

You hid them Tommy I know you did cried the outraged hostess
threatening her suspected guest with the milkpot

I didnt

You did

It isnt proper to contradict said Nan who was hastily eating up the
jelly during the fray

Give them back Demi said Tommy

Thats a fib youve got them in your own pocket bawled Demi roused
by the false accusation

Lets take em away from him Its too bad to make Daisy cry
suggested Nat who found his first ball more exciting than he expected

Daisy was already weeping Bess like a devoted servant mingled her tears
with those of her mistress and Nan denounced the entire race of boys as
plaguey things Meanwhile the battle raged among the gentlemen for
when the two defenders of innocence fell upon the foe that hardened
youth intrenched himself behind a table and pelted them with the stolen
tarts which were very effective missiles being nearly as hard as
bullets While his ammunition held out the besieged prospered but the
moment the last patty flew over the parapet the villain was seized
dragged howling from the room and cast upon the hall floor in an
ignominious heap The conquerors then returned flushed with victory and
while Demi consoled poor Mrs Smith Nat and Nan collected the scattered
tarts replaced each raisin in its proper bed and rearranged the dish
so that it really looked almost as well as ever But their glory had
departed for the sugar was gone and no one cared to eat them after the
insult offered to them

I guess we had better go said Demi suddenly as Aunt Jos voice was
heard on the stairs

Praps we had and Nat hastily dropped a stray jumble that he had
just picked up

But Mrs Jo was among them before the retreat was accomplished and into
her sympathetic ear the young ladies poured the story of their woes

No more balls for these boys till they have atoned for this bad
behavior by doing something kind to you said Mrs Jo shaking her head
at the three culprits

We were only in fun began Demi

I dont like fun that makes other people unhappy I am disappointed in
you Demi for I hoped you would never learn to tease Daisy Such a kind
little sister as she is to you

Boys always tease their sisters Tom says so muttered Demi

I dont intend that my boys shall and I must send Daisy home if you
cannot play happily together said Aunt Jo soberly

At this awful threat Demi sidled up to his sister and Daisy hastily
dried her tears for to be separated was the worst misfortune that could
happen to the twins

Nat was bad too and Tommy was baddest of all observed Nan fearing
that two of the sinners would not get their fair share of punishment

I am sorry said Nat much ashamed

I aint bawled Tommy through the keyhole where he was listening with
all his might

Mrs Jo wanted very much to laugh but kept her countenance and said
impressively as she pointed to the door

You can go boys but remember you are not to speak to or play with
the little girls till I give you leave You dont deserve the pleasure
so I forbid it

The illmannered young gentlemen hastily retired to be received
outside with derision and scorn by the unrepentant Bangs who would
not associate with them for at least fifteen minutes Daisy was soon
consoled for the failure of her ball but lamented the edict that parted
her from her brother and mourned over his shortcomings in her tender
little heart Nan rather enjoyed the trouble and went about turning up
her pug nose at the three especially Tommy who pretended not to care
and loudly proclaimed his satisfaction at being rid of those stupid
girls But in his secret soul he soon repented of the rash act that
caused this banishment from the society he loved and every hour of
separation taught him the value of the stupid girls

The others gave in very soon and longed to be friends for now there
was no Daisy to pet and cook for them no Nan to amuse and doctor them
and worst of all no Mrs Jo to make home life pleasant and life easy
for them To their great affliction Mrs Jo seemed to consider herself
one of the offended girls for she hardly spoke to the outcasts looked
as if she did not see them when she passed and was always too busy now
to attend to their requests This sudden and entire exile from favor
cast a gloom over their souls for when Mother Bhaer deserted them
their sun had set at noonday as it were and they had no refuge left

This unnatural state of things actually lasted for three days then
they could bear it no longer and fearing that the eclipse might become
total went to Mr Bhaer for help and counsel

It is my private opinion that he had received instructions how to behave
if the case should be laid before him But no one suspected it and he
gave the afflicted boys some advice which they gratefully accepted and
carried out in the following manner

Secluding themselves in the garret they devoted several playhours to
the manufacture of some mysterious machine which took so much paste
that Asia grumbled and the little girls wondered mightily Nan nearly
got her inquisitive nose pinched in the door trying to see what was
going on and Daisy sat about openly lamenting that they could not
all play nicely together and not have any dreadful secrets Wednesday
afternoon was fine and after a good deal of consultation about wind and
weather Nat and Tommy went off bearing an immense flat parcel hidden
under many newspapers Nan nearly died with suppressed curiosity Daisy
nearly cried with vexation and both quite trembled with interest when
Demi marched into Mrs Bhaers room hat in hand and said in the
politest tone possible to a mortal boy of his years

Please Aunt Jo would you and the girls come out to a surprise party
we have made for you Do its a very nice one

Thank you we will come with pleasure only I must take Teddy with
me replied Mrs Bhaer with a smile that cheered Demi like sunshine
after rain

Wed like to have him The little wagon is all ready for the girls you
wont mind walking just up to Pennyroyal Hill will you Aunty

I should like it exceedingly but are you quite sure I shall not be in
the way

Oh no indeed we want you very much and the party will be spoilt if
you dont come cried Demi with great earnestness

Thank you kindly sir and Aunt Jo made him a grand curtsey for she
liked frolics as well as any of them

Now young ladies we must not keep them waiting on with the hats and
let us be off at once Im all impatience to know what the surprise is

As Mrs Bhaer spoke every one bustled about and in five minutes the
three little girls and Teddy were packed into the clothesbasket as
they called the wicker wagon which Toby drew Demi walked at the head of
the procession and Mrs Jo brought up the rear escorted by Kit It was
a most imposing party I assure you for Toby had a red featherduster
in his head two remarkable flags waved over the carriage Kit had a
blue bow on his neck which nearly drove him wild Demi wore a nosegay
of dandelions in his buttonhole and Mrs Jo carried the queer Japanese
umbrella in honor of the occasion

The girls had little flutters of excitement all the way and Teddy was
so charmed with the drive that he kept dropping his hat overboard and
when it was taken from him he prepared to tumble out himself evidently
feeling that it behooved him to do something for the amusement of the
party

When they came to the hill nothing was to be seen but the grass
blowing in the wind as the fairy books say and the children looked
disappointed But Demi said in his most impressive manner

Now you all get out and stand still and the surprise party with come
in with which remark he retired behind a rock over which heads had
been bobbing at intervals for the last halfhour

A short pause of intense suspense and then Nat Demi and Tommy marched
forth each bearing a new kite which they presented to the three young
ladies Shrieks of delight arose but were silenced by the boys who
said with faces brimful of merriment That isnt all the surprise
and running behind the rock again emerged bearing a fourth kite of
superb size on which was printed in bright yellow letters For Mother
Bhaer

We thought youd like one too because you were angry with us and
took the girls part cried all three shaking with laughter for this
part of the affair evidently was a surprise to Mrs Jo

She clapped her hands and joined in the laugh looking thoroughly
tickled at the joke

Now boys that is regularly splendid Who did think of it she asked
receiving the monster kite with as much pleasure as the little girls did
theirs

Uncle Fritz proposed it when we planned to make the others he said
youd like it so we made a bouncer answered Demi beaming with
satisfaction at the success of the plot

Uncle Fritz knows what I like Yes these are magnificent kites and
we were wishing we had some the other day when you were flying yours
werent we girls

Thats why we made them for you cried Tommy standing on his head as
the most appropriate way of expressing his emotions

Let us fly them said energetic Nan

I dont know how began Daisy

Well show you we want to cried all the boys in a burst of devotion
as Demi took Daisys Tommy Nans and Nat with difficulty persuaded
Bess to let go her little blue one

Aunty if you will wait a minute well pitch yours for you said
Demi feeling that Mrs Bhaers favor must not be lost again by any
neglect of theirs

Bless your buttons dear I know all about it and here is a boy who
will toss up for me added Mrs Jo as the professor peeped over the
rock with a face full of fun

He came out at once tossed up the big kite and Mrs Jo ran off with it
in fine style while the children stood and enjoyed the spectacle One
by one all the kites went up and floated far overhead like gay birds
balancing themselves on the fresh breeze that blew steadily over the
hill Such a merry time as they had running and shouting sending up
the kites or pulling them down watching their antics in the air and
feeling them tug at the string like live creatures trying to escape
Nan was quite wild with the fun Daisy thought the new play nearly as
interesting as dolls and little Bess was so fond of her boo tite
that she would only let it go on very short flights preferring to
hold it in her lap and look at the remarkable pictures painted on it by
Tommys dashing brush Mrs Jo enjoyed hers immensely and it acted as
if it knew who owned it for it came tumbling down head first when least
expected caught on trees nearly pitched into the river and finally
darted away to such a height that it looked a mere speck among the
clouds

By and by every one got tired and fastening the kitestrings to trees
and fences all sat down to rest except Mr Bhaer who went off to look
at the cows with Teddy on his shoulder

Did you ever have such a good time as this before asked Nat as they
lay about on the grass nibbling pennyroyal like a flock of sheep

Not since I last flew a kite years ago when I was a girl answered
Mrs Jo

Id like to have known you when you were a girl you must have been so
jolly said Nat

I was a naughty little girl I am sorry to say

I like naughty little girls observed Tommy looking at Nan who made
a frightful grimace at him in return for the compliment

Why dont I remember you then Aunty Was I too young asked Demi

Rather dear

I suppose my memory hadnt come then Grandpa says that different parts
of the mind unfold as we grow up and the memory part of my mind hadnt
unfolded when you were little so I cant remember how you looked
explained Demi

Now little Socrates you had better keep that question for grandpa it
is beyond me said Aunt Jo putting on the extinguisher

Well I will he knows about those things and you dont returned
Demi feeling that on the whole kites were better adapted to the
comprehension of the present company

Tell about the last time you flew a kite said Nat for Mrs Jo had
laughed as she spoke of it and he thought it might be interesting

Oh it was only rather funny for I was a great girl of fifteen and
was ashamed to be seen at such a play So Uncle Teddy and I privately
made our kites and stole away to fly them We had a capital time and
were resting as we are now when suddenly we heard voices and saw a
party of young ladies and gentlemen coming back from a picnic Teddy did
not mind though he was rather a large boy to be playing with a kite
but I was in a great flurry for I knew I should be sadly laughed at
and never hear the last of it because my wild ways amused the neighbors
as much as Nans do us

What shall I do I whispered to Teddy as the voices drew nearer and
nearer

Ill show you he said and whipping out his knife he cut the
strings Away flew the kites and when the people came up we were
picking flowers as properly as you please They never suspected us and
we had a grand laugh over our narrow escape

Were the kites lost Aunty asked Daisy

Quite lost but I did not care for I made up my mind that it would be
best to wait till I was an old lady before I played with kites again
and you see I have waited said Mrs Jo beginning to pull in the big
kite for it was getting late

Must we go now

I must or you wont have any supper and that sort of surprise party
would not suit you I think my chickens

Hasnt our party been a nice one asked Tommy complacently

Splendid answered every one

Do you know why It is because your guests have behaved themselves
and tried to make everything go well You understand what I mean dont
you

Yesm was all the boys said but they stole a shamefaced look at one
another as they meekly shouldered their kites and walked home thinking
of another party where the guests had not behaved themselves and things
had gone badly on account of it



CHAPTER X HOME AGAIN

July had come and haying begun the little gardens were doing finely
and the long summer days were full of pleasant hours The house stood
open from morning till night and the lads lived out of doors except at
school time The lessons were short and there were many holidays for
the Bhaers believed in cultivating healthy bodies by much exercise
and our short summers are best used in outofdoor work Such a rosy
sunburnt hearty set as the boys became such appetites as they had
such sturdy arms and legs as outgrew jackets and trousers such
laughing and racing all over the place such antics in house and barn
such adventures in the tramps over hill and dale and such satisfaction
in the hearts of the worthy Bhaers as they saw their flock prospering
in mind and body I cannot begin to describe Only one thing was needed
to make them quite happy and it came when they least expected it

One balmy night when the little lads were in bed the elder ones bathing
down at the brook and Mrs Bhaer undressing Teddy in her parlor he
suddenly cried out Oh my Danny and pointed to the window where the
moon shone brightly

No lovey he is not there it was the pretty moon said his mother

No no Danny at a window Teddy saw him persisted baby much
excited

It might have been and Mrs Bhaer hurried to the window hoping it
would prove true But the face was gone and nowhere appeared any signs
of a mortal boy she called his name ran to the front door with Teddy
in his little shirt and made him call too thinking the baby voice
might have more effect than her own No one answered nothing appeared
and they went back much disappointed Teddy would not be satisfied with
the moon and after he was in his crib kept popping up his head to ask
if Danny was not tummin soon

By and by he fell asleep the lads trooped up to bed the house grew
still and nothing but the chirp of the crickets broke the soft silence
of the summer night Mrs Bhaer sat sewing for the big basket was
always piled with socks full of portentous holes and thinking of the
lost boy She had decided that baby had been mistaken and did not even
disturb Mr Bhaer by telling him of the childs fancy for the poor
man got little time to himself till the boys were abed and he was busy
writing letters It was past ten when she rose to shut up the house As
she paused a minute to enjoy the lovely scene from the steps something
white caught her eye on one of the haycocks scattered over the lawn
The children had been playing there all the afternoon and fancying
that Nan had left her hat as usual Mrs Bhaer went out to get it But
as she approached she saw that it was neither hat nor handkerchief but
a shirt sleeve with a brown hand sticking out of it She hurried round
the haycock and there lay Dan fast asleep

Ragged dirty thin and wornout he looked one foot was bare the
other tied up in the old gingham jacket which he had taken from his own
back to use as a clumsy bandage for some hurt He seemed to have hidden
himself behind the haycock but in his sleep had thrown out the arm
that had betrayed him He sighed and muttered as if his dreams disturbed
him and once when he moved he groaned as if in pain but still slept
on quite spent with weariness

He must not lie here said Mrs Bhaer and stooping over him she
gently called his name He opened his eyes and looked at her as if she
was a part of his dream for he smiled and said drowsily Mother Bhaer
Ive come home

The look the words touched her very much and she put her hand under
his head to lift him up saying in her cordial way

I thought you would and Im so glad to see you Dan He seemed to
wake thoroughly then and started up looking about him as if he suddenly
remembered where he was and doubted even that kind welcome His face
changed and he said in his old rough way

I was going off in the morning I only stopped to peek in as I went
by

But why not come in Dan Didnt you hear us call you Teddy saw and
cried for you

Didnt suppose youd let me in he said fumbling with a little bundle
which he had taken up as if going immediately

Try and see was all Mrs Bhaer answered holding out her hand and
pointing to the door where the light shone hospitably

With a long breath as if a load was off his mind Dan took up a stout
stick and began to limp towards the house but stopped suddenly to say
inquiringly

Mr Bhaer wont like it I ran away from Page

He knows it and was sorry but it will make no difference Are you
lame asked Mrs Jo as he limped on again

Getting over a wall a stone fell on my foot and smashed it I dont
mind and he did his best to hide the pain each step cost him

Mrs Bhaer helped him into her own room and once there he dropped
into a chair and laid his head back white and faint with weariness and
suffering

My poor Dan drink this and then eat a little you are at home now
and Mother Bhaer will take good care of you

He only looked up at her with eyes full of gratitude as he drank the
wine she held to his lips and then began slowly to eat the food she
brought him Each mouthful seemed to put heart into him and presently
he began to talk as if anxious to have her know all about him

Where have you been Dan she asked beginning to get out some
bandages

I ran off moren a month ago Page was good enough but too strict I
didnt like it so I cut away down the river with a man who was going in
his boat Thats why they couldnt tell where Id gone When I left the
man I worked for a couple of weeks with a farmer but I thrashed his
boy and then the old man thrashed me and I ran off again and walked
here

All the way

Yes the man didnt pay me and I wouldnt ask for it Took it out in
beating the boy and Dan laughed yet looked ashamed as he glanced at
his ragged clothes and dirty hands

How did you live It was a long long tramp for a boy like you

Oh I got on well enough till I hurt my foot Folks gave me things to
eat and I slept in barns and tramped by day I got lost trying to make
a short cut or Id have been here sooner

But if you did not mean to come in and stay with us what were you
going to do

I thought Id like to see Teddy again and you and then I was going
back to my old work in the city only I was so tired I went to sleep on
the hay Id have been gone in the morning if you hadnt found me

Are you sorry I did and Mrs Jo looked at him with a half merry half
reproachful look as she knelt down to look at his wounded foot

The color came up into Dans face and he kept his eyes fixed on his
plate as he said very low No maam Im glad I wanted to stay but
I was afraid you

He did not finish for Mrs Bhaer interrupted him by an exclamation of
pity as she saw his foot for it was seriously hurt

When did you do it

Three days ago

And you have walked on it in this state

I had a stick and I washed it at every brook I came to and one woman
gave me a rag to put on it

Mr Bhaer must see and dress it at once and Mrs Jo hastened into the
next room leaving the door ajar behind her so that Dan heard all that
passed

Fritz the boy has come back

Who Dan

Yes Teddy saw him at the window and he called to him but he went
away and hid behind the haycocks on the lawn I found him there just
now fast asleep and half dead with weariness and pain He ran away
from Page a month ago and has been making his way to us ever since He
pretends that he did not mean to let us see him but go on to the city
and his old work after a look at us It is evident however that the
hope of being taken in has led him here through every thing and there
he is waiting to know if you will forgive and take him back

Did he say so

His eyes did and when I waked him he said like a lost child Mother
Bhaer Ive come home I hadnt the heart to scold him and just took
him in like a poor little black sheep come back to the fold I may keep
him Fritz

Of course you may This proves to me that we have a hold on the boys
heart and I would no more send him away now than I would my own Rob

Dan heard a soft little sound as if Mrs Jo thanked her husband without
words and in the instants silence that followed two great tears that
had slowly gathered in the boys eyes brimmed over and rolled down his
dusty cheeks No one saw them for he brushed them hastily away but
in that little pause I think Dans old distrust for these good people
vanished for ever the soft spot in his heart was touched and he felt
an impetuous desire to prove himself worthy of the love and pity that
was so patient and forgiving He said nothing he only wished the wish
with all his might resolved to try in his blind boyish way and
sealed his resolution with the tears which neither pain fatigue nor
loneliness could wring from him

Come and see his foot I am afraid it is badly hurt for he has kept
on three days through heat and dust with nothing but water and an old
jacket to bind it up with I tell you Fritz that boy is a brave lad
and will make a fine man yet

I hope so for your sake enthusiastic woman your faith deserves
success Now I will go and see your little Spartan Where is he

In my room but dear youll be very kind to him no matter how
gruff he seems I am sure that is the way to conquer him He wont bear
sternness nor much restraint but a soft word and infinite patience will
lead him as it used to lead me

As if you ever like this little rascal cried Mr Bhaer laughing yet
half angry at the idea

I was in spirit though I showed it in a different way I seem to know
by instinct how he feels to understand what will win and touch him and
to sympathize with his temptations and faults I am glad I do for it
will help me to help him and if I can make a good man of this wild boy
it will be the best work of my life

God bless the work and help the worker

Mr Bhaer spoke now as earnestly as she had done and both came in
together to find Dans head down upon his arm as if he was quite
overcome by sleep But he looked up quickly and tried to rise as Mr
Bhaer said pleasantly

So you like Plumfield better than Pages farm Well let us see if we
can get on more comfortably this time than we did before

Thanky sir said Dan trying not to be gruff and finding it easier
than he expected

Now the foot Ach this is not well We must have Dr Firth tomorrow
Warm water Jo and old linen

Mr Bhaer bathed and bound up the wounded foot while Mrs Jo prepared
the only empty bed in the house It was in the little guestchamber
leading from the parlor and often used when the lads were poorly for
it saved Mrs Jo from running up and down and the invalids could see
what was going on When it was ready Mr Bhaer took the boy in his
arms and carried him in helped him undress laid him on the little
white bed and left him with another handshake and a fatherly
Goodnight my son

Dan dropped asleep at once and slept heavily for several hours then
his foot began to throb and ache and he awoke to toss about uneasily
trying not to groan lest any one should hear him for he was a brave
lad and did bear pain like a little Spartan as Mr Bhaer called him

Mrs Jo had a way of flitting about the house at night to shut the
windows if the wind grew chilly to draw mosquito curtains over Teddy
or look after Tommy who occasionally walked in his sleep The least
noise waked her and as she often heard imaginary robbers cats and
conflagrations the doors stood open all about so her quick ear caught
the sound of Dans little moans and she was up in a minute He was just
giving his hot pillow a despairing thump when a light came glimmering
through the hall and Mrs Jo crept in looking like a droll ghost
with her hair in a great knob on the top of her head and a long gray
dressinggown trailing behind her

Are you in pain Dan

Its pretty bad but I didnt mean to wake you

Im a sort of owl always flying about at night Yes your foot is like
fire the bandages must be wet again and away flapped the maternal owl
for more cooling stuff and a great mug of ice water

Oh thats so nice sighed Dan the wet bandages went on again and a
long draught of water cooled his thirsty throat

There now sleep your best and dont be frightened if you see me
again for Ill slip down by and by and give you another sprinkle

As she spoke Mrs Jo stooped to turn the pillow and smooth the
bedclothes when to her great surprise Dan put his arm around her
neck drew her face down to his and kissed her with a broken Thank
you maam which said more than the most eloquent speech could have
done for the hasty kiss the muttered words meant Im sorry I will
try She understood it accepted the unspoken confession and did not
spoil it by any token of surprise She only remembered that he had no
mother kissed the brown cheek half hidden on the pillow as if ashamed
of the little touch of tenderness and left him saying what he long
remembered You are my boy now and if you choose you can make me proud
and glad to say so

Once again just at dawn she stole down to find him so fast asleep
that he did not wake and showed no sign of consciousness as she wet his
foot except that the lines of pain smoothed themselves away and left
his face quite peaceful

The day was Sunday and the house so still that he never waked till near
noon and looking round him saw an eager little face peering in at
the door He held out his arms and Teddy tore across the room to cast
himself bodily upon the bed shouting My Dannys tum as he hugged
and wriggled with delight Mrs Bhaer appeared next bringing breakfast
and never seeming to see how shamefaced Dan looked at the memory of the
little scene last night Teddy insisted on giving him his betfus and
fed him like a baby which as he was not very hungry Dan enjoyed very
much

Then came the doctor and the poor Spartan had a bad time of it for
some of the little bones in his foot were injured and putting them to
rights was such a painful job that Dans lips were white and great
drops stood on his forehead though he never cried out and only held
Mrs Jos hand so tight that it was red long afterwards

You must keep this boy quiet for a week at least and not let him put
his foot to the ground By that time I shall know whether he may hop a
little with a crutch or stick to his bed for a while longer said Dr
Firth putting up the shining instruments that Dan did not like to see

It will get well sometime wont it he asked looking alarmed at the
word crutches

I hope so and with that the doctor departed leaving Dan much
depressed for the loss of a foot is a dreadful calamity to an active
boy

Dont be troubled I am a famous nurse and we will have you tramping
about as well as ever in a month said Mrs Jo taking a hopeful view
of the case

But the fear of being lame haunted Dan and even Teddys caresses did
not cheer him so Mrs Jo proposed that one or two of the boys should
come in and pay him a little visit and asked whom he would like to see

Nat and Demi Id like my hat too theres something in it I guess
theyd like to see I suppose you threw away my bundle of plunder said
Dan looking rather anxious as he put the question

No I kept it for I thought they must be treasures of some kind you
took such care of them and Mrs Jo brought him his old straw hat
stuck full of butterflies and beetles and a handkerchief containing a
collection of odd things picked up on his way birds eggs carefully
done up in moss curious shells and stones bits of fungus and several
little crabs in a state of great indignation at their imprisonment

Could I have something to put these fellers in Mr Hyde and I found
em and they are firstrate ones so Id like to keep and watch em
can I asked Dan forgetting his foot and laughing to see the crabs go
sidling and backing over the bed

Of course you can Pollys old cage will be just the thing Dont let
them nip Teddys toes while I get it and away went Mrs Jo leaving
Dan overjoyed to find that his treasures were not considered rubbish
and thrown away

Nat Demi and the cage arrived together and the crabs were settled
in their new house to the great delight of the boys who in the
excitement of the performance forgot any awkwardness they might
otherwise have felt in greeting the runaway To these admiring listeners
Dan related his adventures much more fully than he had done to the
Bhaers Then he displayed his plunder and described each article so
well that Mrs Jo who had retired to the next room to leave them
free was surprised and interested as well as amused at their boyish
chatter

How much the lad knows of these things how absorbed he is in them and
what a mercy it is just now for he cares so little for books it would
be hard to amuse him while he is laid up but the boys can supply him
with beetles and stones to any extent and I am glad to find out this
taste of his it is a good one and may perhaps prove the making of him
If he should turn out a great naturalist and Nat a musician I should
have cause to be proud of this years work and Mrs Jo sat smiling
over her book as she built castles in the air just as she used to do
when a girl only then they were for herself and now they were for
other people which is the reason perhaps that some of them came to
pass in reality for charity is an excellent foundation to build anything
upon

Nat was most interested in the adventures but Demi enjoyed the beetles
and butterflies immensely drinking in the history of their changeful
little lives as if it were a new and lovely sort of fairy tale for even
in his plain way Dan told it well and found great satisfaction in the
thought that here at least the small philosopher could learn of him So
interested were they in the account of catching a musk rat whose skin
was among the treasures that Mr Bhaer had to come himself to tell Nat
and Demi it was time for the walk Dan looked so wistfully after them as
they ran off that Father Bhaer proposed carrying him to the sofa in the
parlor for a little change of air and scene

When he was established and the house quiet Mrs Jo who sat near
by showing Teddy pictures said in an interested tone as she nodded
towards the treasures still in Dans hands

Where did you learn so much about these things

I always liked em but didnt know much till Mr Hyde told me

Oh he was a man who lived round in the woods studying these things I
dont know what you call him and wrote about frogs and fishes and so
on He stayed at Pages and used to want me to go and help him and it
was great fun cause he told me ever so much and was uncommon jolly
and wise Hope Ill see him again sometime

I hope you will said Mrs Jo for Dans face had brightened up and
he was so interested in the matter that he forgot his usual taciturnity

Why he could make birds come to him and rabbits and squirrels didnt
mind him any more than if he was a tree Did you ever tickle a lizard
with a straw asked Dan eagerly

No but I should like to try it

Well Ive done it and its so funny to see em turn over and stretch
out they like it so much Mr Hyde used to do it and hed make snakes
listen to him while he whistled and he knew just when certain flowers
would blow and bees wouldnt sting him and hed tell the wonderfullest
things about fish and flies and the Indians and the rocks

I think you were so fond of going with Mr Hyde you rather neglected
Mr Page said Mrs Jo slyly

Yes I did I hated to have to weed and hoe when I might be tramping
round with Mr Hyde Page thought such things silly and called Mr Hyde
crazy because hed lay hours watching a trout or a bird

Suppose you say lie instead of lay it is better grammar said Mrs
Jo very gently and then added Yes Page is a thorough farmer and
would not understand that a naturalists work was just as interesting
and perhaps just as important as his own Now Dan if you really love
these things as I think you do and I am glad to see it you shall have
time to study them and books to help you but I want you to do something
besides and to do it faithfully else you will be sorry by and by and
find that you have got to begin again

Yes maam said Dan meekly and looked a little scared by the
serious tone of the last remarks for he hated books yet had evidently
made up his mind to study anything she proposed

Do you see that cabinet with twelve drawers in it was the next very
unexpected question

Dan did see two tall oldfashioned ones standing on either side of the
piano he knew them well and had often seen nice bits of string nails
brown paper and such useful matters come out of the various drawers He
nodded and smiled Mrs Jo went on

Well dont you think those drawers would be good places to put your
eggs and stones and shells and lichens

Oh splendid but you wouldnt like my things clutterin round as
Mr Page used to say would you cried Dan sitting up to survey the
old piece of furniture with sparkling eyes

I like litter of that sort and if I didnt I should give you the
drawers because I have a regard for childrens little treasures and
I think they should be treated respectfully Now I am going to make a
bargain with you Dan and I hope you will keep it honorably Here are
twelve goodsized drawers one for each month of the year and they
shall be yours as fast as you earn them by doing the little duties that
belong to you I believe in rewards of a certain kind especially for
young folks they help us along and though we may begin by being good
for the sake of the reward if it is rightly used we shall soon learn
to love goodness for itself

Do you have em asked Dan looking as if this was new talk for him

Yes indeed I havent learnt to get on without them yet My rewards
are not drawers or presents or holidays but they are things which I
like as much as you do the others The good behavior and success of my
boys is one of the rewards I love best and I work for it as I want you
to work for your cabinet Do what you dislike and do it well and
you get two rewards one the prize you see and hold the other the
satisfaction of a duty cheerfully performed Do you understand that

Yes maam

We all need these little helps so you shall try to do your lessons and
your work play kindly with all the boys and use your holidays well
and if you bring me a good report or if I see and know it without words
for Im quick to spy out the good little efforts of my boys you shall
have a compartment in the drawer for your treasures See some are
already divided into four parts and I will have the others made in
the same way a place for each week and when the drawer is filled
with curious and pretty things I shall be as proud of it as you are
prouder I think for in the pebbles mosses and gay butterflies I
shall see good resolutions carried out conquered faults and a promise
well kept Shall we do this Dan

The boys answered with one of the looks which said much for it showed
that he felt and understood her wish and words although he did not know
how to express his interest and gratitude for such care and kindness
She understood the look and seeing by the color that flushed up to his
forehead that he was touched as she wished him to be she said no more
about that side of the new plan but pulled out the upper drawer dusted
it and set it on two chairs before the sofa saying briskly

Now let us begin at once by putting those nice beetles in a safe
place These compartments will hold a good deal you see Id pin the
butterflies and bugs round the sides they will be quite safe there and
leave room for the heavy things below Ill give you some cotton wool
and clean paper and pins and you can get ready for the weeks work

But I cant go out to find any new things said Dan looking piteously
at his foot

Thats true never mind well let these treasures do for this week
and I dare say the boys will bring you loads of things if you ask them

They dont know the right sort besides if I lay no lie here all the
time I cant work and study and earn my drawers

There are plenty of lessons you can learn lying there and several
little jobs of work you can do for me

Can I and Dan looked both surprised and pleased

You can learn to be patient and cheerful in spite of pain and no play
You can amuse Teddy for me wind cotton read to me when I sew and do
many things without hurting your foot which will make the days pass
quickly and not be wasted ones

Here Demi ran in with a great butterfly in one hand and a very ugly
little toad in the other

See Dan I found them and ran back to give them to you arent they
beautiful ones panted Demi all out of breath

Dan laughed at the toad and said he had no place to put him but the
butterfly was a beauty and if Mrs Jo would give him a big pin he
would stick it right up in the drawer

I dont like to see the poor thing struggle on a pin if it must be
killed let us put it out of pain at once with a drop of camphor said
Mrs Jo getting out the bottle

I know how to do it Mr Hyde always killed em that way but I didnt
have any camphor so I use a pin and Dan gently poured a drop on the
insects head when the pale green wings fluttered an instant and then
grew still

This dainty little execution was hardly over when Teddy shouted from the
bedroom Oh the little trabs are out and the big ones eaten em
all up Demi and his aunt ran to the rescue and found Teddy dancing
excitedly in a chair while two little crabs were scuttling about the
floor having got through the wires of the cage A third was clinging to
the top of the cage evidently in terror of his life for below appeared
a sad yet funny sight The big crab had wedged himself into the little
recess where Pollys cup used to stand and there he sat eating one of
his relations in the coolest way All the claws of the poor victim were
pulled off and he was turned upside down his upper shell held in
one claw close under the mouth of the big crab like a dish while he
leisurely ate out of it with the other claw pausing now and then to
turn his queer bulging eyes from side to side and to put out a slender
tongue and lick them in a way that made the children scream with
laughter Mrs Jo carried the cage in for Dan to see the sight while
Demi caught and confined the wanderers under an inverted washbowl

Ill have to let these fellers go for I cant keep em in the house
said Dan with evident regret

Ill take care of them for you if you will tell me how and they can
live in my turtletank just as well as not said Demi who found them
more interesting even that his beloved slow turtles So Dan gave him
directions about the wants and habits of the crabs and Demi bore them
away to introduce them to their new home and neighbors What a good
boy he is said Dan carefully settling the first butterfly and
remembering that Demi had given up his walk to bring it to him

He ought to be for a great deal has been done to make him so

Hes had folks to tell him things and to help him I havent said
Dan with a sigh thinking of his neglected childhood a thing he seldom
did and feeling as if he had not had fair play somehow

I know it dear and for that reason I dont expect as much from you as
from Demi though he is younger you shall have all the help that we can
give you now and I hope to teach you how to help yourself in the best
way Have you forgotten what Father Bhaer told you when you were here
before about wanting to be good and asking God to help you

No maam very low

Do you try that way still

No maam lower still

Will you do it every night to please me

Yes maam very soberly

I shall depend on it and I think I shall know if you are faithful
to your promise for these things always show to people who believe in
them though not a word is said Now here is a pleasant story about a
boy who hurt his foot worse than you did yours read it and see how
bravely he bore his troubles

She put that charming little book The Crofton Boys into his hands
and left him for an hour passing in and out from time to time that
he might not feel lonely Dan did not love to read but soon got so
interested that he was surprised when the boys came home Daisy brought
him a nosegay of wild flowers and Nan insisted on helping bring him his
supper as he lay on the sofa with the door open into the diningroom
so that he could see the lads at table and they could nod socially to
him over their bread and butter

Mr Bhaer carried him away to his bed early and Teddy came in his
nightgown to say goodnight for he went to his little nest with the
birds

I want to say my prayers to Danny may I he asked and when his
mother said Yes the little fellow knelt down by Dans bed and
folding his chubby hands said softly

Pease Dod bess everybody and hep me to be dood

Then he went away smiling with sleepy sweetness over his mothers
shoulder

But after the evening talk was done the evening song sung and the
house grew still with beautiful Sunday silence Dan lay in his pleasant
room wide awake thinking new thoughts feeling new hopes and desires
stirring in his boyish heart for two good angels had entered in love
and gratitude began the work which time and effort were to finish and
with an earnest wish to keep his first promise Dan folded his hands
together in the Darkness and softly whispered Teddys little prayer

Please God bless every one and help me to be good



CHAPTER XI UNCLE TEDDY

For a week Dan only moved from bed to sofa a long week and a hard one
for the hurt foot was very painful at times the quiet days were very
wearisome to the active lad longing to be out enjoying the summer
weather and especially difficult was it to be patient But Dan did
his best and every one helped him in their various ways so the time
passed and he was rewarded at last by hearing the doctor say on
Saturday morning

This foot is doing better than I expected Give the lad the crutch this
afternoon and let him stump about the house a little

Hooray shouted Nat and raced away to tell the other boys the good
news

Everybody was very glad and after dinner the whole flock assembled to
behold Dan crutch himself up and down the hall a few times before he
settled in the porch to hold a sort of levee He was much pleased at the
interest and goodwill shown him and brightened up more and more every
minute for the boys came to pay their respects the little girls fussed
about him with stools and cushions and Teddy watched over him as if he
was a frail creature unable to do anything for himself They were still
sitting and standing about the steps when a carriage stopped at the
gate a hat was waved from it and with a shout of Uncle Teddy Uncle
Teddy Rob scampered down the avenue as fast as his short legs would
carry him All he boys but Dan ran after him to see who should be
first to open the gate and in a moment the carriage drove up with boys
swarming all over it while Uncle Teddy sat laughing in the midst with
his little daughter on his knee

Stop the triumphal car and let Jupiter descend he said and jumping
out ran up the steps to meet Mrs Bhaer who stood smiling and clapping
her hands like a girl

How goes it Teddy

All right Jo

Then they shook hands and Mr Laurie put Bess into her aunts arms
saying as the child hugged her tight Goldilocks wanted to see you so
much that I ran away with her for I was quite pining for a sight of you
myself We want to play with your boys for an hour or so and to see how
the old woman who lived in a shoe and had so many children she did not
know what to do is getting on

Im so glad Play away and dont get into mischief answered Mrs
Jo as the lads crowded round the pretty child admiring her long golden
hair dainty dress and lofty ways for the little Princess as they
called her allowed no one to kiss her but sat smiling down upon them
and graciously patting their heads with her little white hands They
all adored her especially Rob who considered her a sort of doll
and dared not touch her lest she should break but worshipped her at a
respectful distance made happy by an occasional mark of favor from her
little highness As she immediately demanded to see Daisys kitchen
she was borne off by Mrs Jo with a train of small boys following The
others all but Nat and Demi ran away to the menagerie and gardens
to have all in order for Mr Laurie always took a general survey and
looked disappointed if things were not flourishing

Standing on the steps he turned to Dan saying like an old
acquaintance though he had only seen him once or twice before

How is the foot

Better sir

Rather tired of the house arent you

Guess I am and Dans eyes roved away to the green hills and woods
where he longed to be

Suppose we take a little turn before the others come back That big
easy carriage will be quite safe and comfortable and a breath of fresh
air will do you good Get a cushion and a shawl Demi and lets carry
Dan off

The boys thought it a capital joke and Dan looked delighted but asked
with an unexpected burst of virtue

Will Mrs Bhaer like it

Oh yes we settled all that a minute ago

You didnt say any thing about it so I dont see how you could said
Demi inquisitively

We have a way of sending messages to one another without any words It
is a great improvement on the telegraph

I know its eyes I saw you lift your eyebrows and nod toward the
carriage and Mrs Bhaer laughed and nodded back again cried Nat who
was quite at his ease with kind Mr Laurie by this time

Right Now them come on and in a minute Dan found himself settled in
the carriage his foot on a cushion on the seat opposite nicely
covered with a shawl which fell down from the upper regions in a most
mysterious manner just when they wanted it Demi climbed up to the
box beside Peter the black coachman Nat sat next Dan in the place of
honor while Uncle Teddy would sit opposite to take care of the foot
he said but really that he might study the faces before him both so
happy yet so different for Dans was square and brown and strong
while Nats was long and fair and rather weak but very amiable with
its mild eyes and good forehead

By the way Ive got a book somewhere here that you may like to see
said the oldest boy of the party diving under the seat and producing a
book which make Dan exclaim

Oh by George isnt that a stunner as he turned the leaves and saw
fine plates of butterflies and birds and every sort of interesting
insect colored like life He was so charmed that he forgot his thanks
but Mr Laurie did not mind and was quite satisfied to see the boys
eager delight and to hear this exclamations over certain old friends as
he came to them Nat leaned on his shoulder to look and Demi turned his
back to the horses and let his feet dangle inside the carriage so that
he might join in the conversation

When they got among the beetles Mr Laurie took a curious little object
out of his vestpocket and laying it in the palm of his hand said

Theres a beetle that is thousands of years old and then while the
lads examined the queer stonebug that looked so old and gray he told
them how it came out of the wrappings of a mummy after lying for ages
in a famous tomb Finding them interested he went on to tell about the
Egyptians and the strange and splendid ruins they have left behind them
the Nile and how he sailed up the mighty river with the handsome dark
men to work his boat how he shot alligators saw wonderful beasts and
birds and afterwards crossed the desert on a camel who pitched him
about like a ship in a storm

Uncle Teddy tells stories most as well as Grandpa said Demi
approvingly when the tale was done and the boys eyes asked for more

Thank you said Mr Laurie quite soberly for he considered Demis
praise worth having for children are good critics in such cases and to
suit them is an accomplishment that any one may be proud of

Heres another trifle or two that I tucked into my pocket as I was
turning over my traps to see if I had any thing that would amuse Dan
and Uncle Teddy produced a fine arrowhead and a string of wampum

Oh tell about the Indians cried Demi who was fond of playing
wigwam

Dan knows lots about them added Nat

More than I do I dare say Tell us something and Mr Laurie looked
as interested as the other two

Mr Hyde told me hes been among em and can talk their talk
and likes em began Dan flattered by their attention but rather
embarrassed by having a grownup listener

What is wampum for asked curious Demi from his perch

The others asked questions likewise and before he knew it Dan was
reeling off all Mr Hyde had told him as they sailed down the river
a few weeks before Mr Laurie listened well but found the boy more
interesting than the Indians for Mrs Jo had told him about Dan and
he rather took a fancy to the wild lad who ran away as he himself
had often longed to do and who was slowly getting tamed by pain and
patience

Ive been thinking that it would be a good plan for you fellows to have
a museum of your own a place in which to collect all the curious and
interesting things that you find and make and have given you Mrs Jo
is too kind to complain but it is rather hard for her to have the house
littered up with all sorts of rattletraps halfapint of dorbugs in
one of her best vases for instance a couple of dead bats nailed up in
the back entry wasps nests tumbling down on peoples heads and stones
lying round everywhere enough to pave the avenue There are not many
women who would stand that sort of thing are there now

As Mr Laurie spoke with a merry look in his eyes the boys laughed and
nudged one another for it was evident that some one told tales out of
school else how could he know of the existence of these inconvenient
treasures

Where can we put them then said Demi crossing his legs and leaning
down to argue the question

In the old carriagehouse

But it leaks and there isnt any window nor any place to put things
and its all dust and cobwebs began Nat

Wait till Gibbs and I have touched it up a bit and then see how
you like it He is to come over on Monday to get it ready then
next Saturday I shall come out and we will fix it up and make the
beginning at least of a fine little museum Every one can bring
his things and have a place for them and Dan is to be the head man
because he knows most about such matters and it will be quiet pleasant
work for him now that he cant knock about much

Wont that be jolly cried Nat while Dan smiled all over his face and
had not a word to say but hugged his book and looked at Mr Laurie
as if he thought him one of the greatest public benefactors that ever
blessed the world

Shall I go round again sir asked Peter as they came to the gate
after two slow turns about the halfmile triangle

No we must be prudent else we cant come again I must go over the
premises take a look at the carriagehouse and have a little talk with
Mrs Jo before I go and having deposited Dan on his sofa to rest and
enjoy his book Uncle Teddy went off to have a frolic with the lads who
were raging about the place in search of him Leaving the little girls
to mess upstairs Mrs Bhaer sat down by Dan and listened to his eager
account of the drive till the flock returned dusty warm and much
excited about the new museum which every one considered the most
brilliant idea of the age

I always wanted to endow some sort of an institution and I am going to
begin with this said Mr Laurie sitting down on a stool at Mrs Jos
feet

You have endowed one already What do you call this and Mrs Jo
pointed to the happyfaced lads who had camped upon the floor about
him

I call it a very promising Bhaergarden and Im proud to be a member
of it Did you know I was the head boy in this school he asked
turning to Dan and changing the subject skilfully for he hated to be
thanked for the generous things he did

I thought Franz was answered Dan wondering what the man meant

Oh dear no Im the first boy Mrs Jo ever had to take care of and I
was such a bad one that she isnt done with me yet though she has been
working at me for years and years

How old she must be said Nat innocently

She began early you see Poor thing she was only fifteen when she
took me and I led her such a life its a wonder she isnt wrinkled and
gray and quite worn out and Mr Laurie looked up at her laughing

Dont Teddy I wont have you abuse yourself so and Mrs Jo stroked
the curly black head at her knee as affectionately as ever for in
spite of every thing Teddy was her boy still

If it hadnt been for you there never would have been a Plumfield It
was my success with you sir that gave me courage to try my pet plan
So the boys may thank you for it and name the new institution The
Laurence Museum in honor of its founder wont we boys she added
looking very like the lively Jo of old times

We will we will shouted the boys throwing up their hats for though
they had taken them off on entering the house according to rule they
had been in too much of a hurry to hang them up

Im as hungry as a bear cant I have a cookie asked Mr Laurie when
the shout subsided and he had expressed his thanks by a splendid bow

Trot out and ask Asia for the gingerbreadbox Demi It isnt in order
to eat between meals but on this joyful occasion we wont mind and
have a cookie all round said Mrs Jo and when the box came she
dealt them out with a liberal hand every one munching away in a social
circle

Suddenly in the midst of a bite Mr Laurie cried out Bless my heart
I forgot grandmas bundle and running out to the carriage returned
with an interesting white parcel which being opened disclosed a
choice collection of beasts birds and pretty things cut out of crisp
sugary cake and baked a lovely brown

Theres one for each and a letter to tell which is whose Grandma and
Hannah made them and I tremble to think what would have happened to me
if I had forgotten to leave them

Then amid much laughing and fun the cakes were distributed A fish for
Dan a fiddle for Nat a book for Demi a money for Tommy a flower for
Daisy a hoop for Nan who had driven twice round the triangle without
stopping a star for Emil who put on airs because he studied astronomy
and best of all an omnibus for Franz whose great delight was to drive
the family bus Stuffy got a fat pig and the little folks had birds
and cats and rabbits with black currant eyes

Now I must go Where is my Goldilocks Mamma will come flying out to
get her if Im not back early said Uncle Teddy when the last crumb
had vanished which it speedily did you may be sure

The young ladies had gone into the garden and while they waited till
Franz looked them up Jo and Laurie stood at the door talking together

How does little Giddygaddy come on he asked for Nans pranks amused
him very much and he was never tired of teasing Jo about her

Nicely she is getting quite mannerly and begins to see the error of
her wild ways

Dont the boys encourage her in them

Yes but I keep talking and lately she has improved much You saw how
prettily she shook hands with you and how gentle she was with Bess
Daisys example has its effect upon her and Im quite sure that a few
months will work wonders

Here Mrs Jos remarks were cut short by the appearance of Nan tearing
round the corner at a breakneck pace driving a mettlesome team of four
boys and followed by Daisy trundling Bess in a wheelbarrow Hat off
hair flying whip cracking and barrow bumping up they came in a cloud
of dust looking as wild a set of little hoydens as one would wish to
see

So these are the model children are they Its lucky I didnt bring
Mrs Curtis out to see your school for the cultivation of morals
and manners she would never have recovered from the shock of this
spectacle said Mr Laurie laughing at Mrs Jos premature rejoicing
over Nans improvement

Laugh away Ill succeed yet As you used to say at College quoting
some professor Though the experiment has failed the principle remains
the same said Mrs Bhaer joining in the merriment

Im afraid Nans example is taking effect upon Daisy instead of the
other way Look at my little princess she has utterly forgotten her
dignity and is screaming like the rest Young ladies what does
this mean and Mr Laurie rescued his small daughter from impending
destruction for the four horses were champing their bits and curvetting
madly all about her as she sat brandishing a great whip in both hands

Were having a race and I beat shouted Nan

I could have run faster only I was afraid of spilling Bess screamed
Daisy

Hi go long cried the princess giving such a flourish with her whip
that the horses ran away and were seen no more

My precious child come away from this illmannered crew before you are
quite spoilt Goodby Jo Next time I come I shall expect to find the
boys making patchwork

It wouldnt hurt them a bit I dont give in mind you for my
experiments always fail a few times before they succeed Love to Amy and
my blessed Marmee called Mrs Jo as the carriage drove away and the
last Mr Laurie saw of her she was consoling Daisy for her failure by a
ride in the wheelbarrow and looking as if she liked it

Great was the excitement all the week about the repairs in the
carriagehouse which went briskly on in spite of the incessant
questions advice and meddling of the boys Old Gibbs was nearly driven
wild with it all but managed to do his work nevertheless and by
Friday night the place was all in order roof mended shelves up walls
whitewashed a great window cut at the back which let in a flood of
sunshine and gave them a fine view of the brook the meadows and the
distant hills and over the great door painted in red letters was The
Laurence Museum

All Saturday morning the boys were planning how it should be furnished
with their spoils and when Mr Laurie arrived bringing an aquarium
which Mrs Amy said she was tired of their rapture was great

The afternoon was spent in arranging things and when the running and
lugging and hammering was over the ladies were invited to behold the
institution

It certainly was a pleasant place airy clean and bright A hopvine
shook its green bells round the open window the pretty aquarium stood
in the middle of the room with some delicate water plants rising above
the water and goldfish showing their brightness as they floated to and
fro below On either side of the window were rows of shelves ready to
receive the curiosities yet to be found Dans tall cabinet stood before
the great door which was fastened up while the small door was to be
used On the cabinet stood a queer Indian idol very ugly but very
interesting old Mr Laurence sent it as well as a fine Chinese junk in
full sail which had a conspicuous place on the long table in the middle
of the room Above swinging in a loop and looking as if she was alive
hung Polly who died at an advanced age had been carefully stuffed and
was no presented by Mrs Jo The walls were decorated with all sorts of
things A snakes skin a big wasps nest a birchbark canoe a string
of birds eggs wreaths of gray moss from the South and a bunch of
cottonpods The dead bats had a place also a large turtleshell and
an ostrichegg proudly presented by Demi who volunteered to explain
these rare curiosities to guests whenever they liked There were so many
stones that it was impossible to accept them all so only a few of the
best were arranged among the shells on the shelves the rest were piled
up in corners to be examined by Dan at his leisure

Every one was eager to give something even Silas who sent home for
a stuffed wildcat killed in his youth It was rather motheaten and
shabby but on a high bracket and best side foremost the effect was
fine for the yellow glass eyes glared and the mouth snarled so
naturally that Teddy shook in his little shoes at sight of it when he
came bringing his most cherished treasure one cocoon to lay upon the
shrine of science

Isnt it beautiful Id no idea we had so many curious things I gave
that dont it look well We might make a lot by charging something for
letting folks see it

Jack added that last suggestion to the general chatter that went on as
the family viewed the room

This is a free museum and if there is any speculating on it Ill paint
out the name over the door said Mr Laurie turning so quickly that
Jack wished he had held his tongue

Hear hear cried Mr Bhaer

Speech speech added Mrs Jo

Cant Im too bashful You give them a lecture yourself you are used
to it Mr Laurie answered retreating towards the window meaning to
escape But she held him fast and said laughing as she looked at the
dozen pairs of dirty hands about her

If I did lecture it would on the chemical and cleansing properties of
soap Come now as the founder of the institution you really ought to
give us a few moral remarks and we will applaud tremendously

Seeing that there was no way of escaping Mr Laurie looked up at Polly
hanging overhead seemed to find inspiration in the brilliant old bird
and sitting down upon the table said in his pleasant way

There is one thing Id like to suggest boys and that is I want you
to get some good as well as much pleasure out of this Just putting
curious or pretty things here wont do it so suppose you read up about
them so that when anybody asks questions you can answer them and
understand the matter I used to like these things myself and should
enjoy hearing about them now for Ive forgotten all I once knew It
wasnt much was it Jo Heres Dan now full of stories about birds
and bugs and so on let him take care of the museum and once a week
the rest of you take turns to read a composition or tell about some
animal mineral or vegetable We should all like that and I think it
would put considerable useful knowledge into our heads What do you say
Professor

I like it much and will give the lads all the help I can But they
will need books to read up these new subjects and we have not many
I fear began Mr Bhaer looking much pleased planning many fine
lectures on geology which he liked We should have a library for the
special purpose

Is that a useful sort of book Dan asked Mr Laurie pointing to the
volume that lay open by the cabinet

Oh yes it tells all I want to know about insects I had it here to
see how to fix the butterflies right I covered it so it is not hurt
and Dan caught it up fearing the lender might think him careless

Give it here a minute and pulling out his pencil Mr Laurie wrote
Dans name in it saying as he set the book up on one of the corner
shelves where nothing stood but a stuffed bird without a tail There
that is the beginning of the museum library Ill hunt up some more
books and Demi shall keep them in order Where are those jolly little
books we used to read Jo Insect Architecture or some such name all
about ants having battles and bees having queens and crickets eating
holes in our clothes and stealing milk and larks of that sort

In the garret at home Ill have them sent out and we will plunge into
Natural History with a will said Mrs Jo ready for any thing

Wont it be hard to write about such things asked Nat who hated
compositions

At first perhaps but you will soon like it If you think that hard
how would you like to have this subject given to you as it was to a
girl of thirteen A conversation between Themistocles Aristides and
Pericles on the proposed appropriation of funds of the confederacy of
Delos for the ornamentation of Athens said Mrs Jo

The boys groaned at the mere sound of the long names and the gentlemen
laughed at the absurdity of the lesson

Did she write it asked Demi in an awestricken tone

Yes but you can imagine what a piece of work she make of it though
she was rather a bright child

Id like to have seen it said Mr Bhaer

Perhaps I can find it for you I went to school with her and Mrs Jo
looked so wicked that every one knew who the little girl was

Hearing of this fearful subject for a composition quite reconciled
the boys to the thought of writing about familiar things Wednesday
afternoon was appointed for the lectures as they preferred to call
them for some chose to talk instead of write Mr Bhaer promised a
portfolio in which the written productions should be kept and Mrs
Bhaer said she would attend the course with great pleasure

Then the dirtyhanded society went off the wash followed by the
Professor trying to calm the anxiety of Rob who had been told by Tommy
that all water was full of invisible pollywogs

I like your plan very much only dont be too generous Teddy said
Mrs Bhaer when they were left alone You know most of the boys have
got to paddle their own canoes when they leave us and too much sitting
in the lap of luxury will unfit them for it

Ill be moderate but do let me amuse myself I get desperately tired
of business sometimes and nothing freshens me up like a good frolic
with your boys I like that Dan very much Jo He isnt demonstrative
but he has the eye of a hawk and when you have tamed him a little he
will do you credit

Im so glad you think so Thank you very much for your kindness to him
especially for this museum affair it will keep him happy while he is
lame give me a chance to soften and smooth this poor rough lad and
make him love us What did inspire you with such a beautiful helpful
idea Teddy asked Mrs Bhaer glancing back at the pleasant room as
she turned to leave it

Laurie took both her hands in his and answered with a look that made
her eyes fill with happy tears

Dear Jo I have known what it is to be a motherless boy and I never
can forget how much you and yours have done for me all these years



CHAPTER XII HUCKLEBERRIES

There was a great clashing of tin pails much running to and fro and
frequent demands for something to eat one August afternoon for the
boys were going huckleberrying and made as much stir about it as if
they were setting out to find the North West Passage

Now my lads get off as quietly as you can for Rob is safely out
of the way and wont see you said Mrs Bhaer as she tied Daisys
broadbrimmed hat and settled the great blue pinafore in which she had
enveloped Nan

But the plan did not succeed for Rob had heard the bustle decided to
go and prepared himself without a thought of disappointment The troop
was just getting under way when the little man came marching downstairs
with his best hat on a bright tin pail in his hand and a face beaming
with satisfaction

Oh dear now we shall have a scene sighed Mrs Bhaer who found her
eldest son very hard to manage at times

Im all ready said Rob and took his place in the ranks with such
perfect unconsciousness of his mistake that it really was very hard to
undeceive him

Its too far for you my love stay and take care of me for I shall be
all alone began his mother

Youve got Teddy Im a big boy so I can go you said I might when I
was bigger and I am now persisted Rob with a cloud beginning to dim
the brightness of his happy face

We are going up to the great pasture and its ever so far we dont
want you tagging on cried Jack who did not admire the little boys

I wont tag Ill run and keep up O Mamma let me go I want to fill
my new pail and Ill bring em all to you Please please I will
be good prayed Robby looking up at his mother so grieved and
disappointed that her heart began to fail her

But my deary youll get so tired and hot you wont have a good time
Wait till I go and then we will stay all day and pick as many berries
as you want

You never do go you are so busy and Im tired of waiting Id rather
go and get the berries for you all myself I love to pick em and I
want to fill my new pail dreffly sobbed Rob

The pathetic sight of great tears tinkling into the dear new pail and
threatening to fill it with salt water instead of huckleberries touched
all the ladies present His mother patted the weeper on his back Daisy
offered to stay home with him and Nan said in her decided way

Let him come Ill take care of him

If Franz was going I wouldnt mind for he is very careful but he is
haying with the father and Im not sure about the rest of you began
Mrs Bhaer

Its so far put in Jack

Id carry him if I was going wish I was said Dan with a sigh

Thank you dear but you must take care of your foot I wish I could
go Stop a minute I think I can manage it after all and Mrs Bhaer
ran out to the steps waving her apron wildly

Silas was just driving away in the haycart but turned back and agreed
at once when Mrs Jo proposed that he should take the whole party to
the pasture and go for them at five oclock

It will delay your work a little but never mind we will pay you in
huckleberry pies said Mrs Jo knowing Silass weak point

His rough brown face brightened up and he said with a cheery Haw
haw Wal now Mis Bhaer if you go to bribin of me I shall give in
right away

Now boys I have arranged it so that you can all go said Mrs Bhaer
running back again much relieved for she loved to make them happy and
always felt miserable when she had disturbed the serenity of her little
sons for she believed that the small hopes and plans and pleasures
of children should be tenderly respected by grownup people and never
rudely thwarted or ridiculed

Can I go said Dan delighted

I thought especially of you Be careful and never mind the berries
but sit about and enjoy the lovely things which you know how to find all
about you answered Mrs Bhaer who remembered his kind offer to her
boy

Me too me too sung Rob dancing with joy and clapping his precious
pail and cover like castanets

Yes and Daisy and Nan must take good care of you Be at the bars at
five oclock and Silas will come for you all

Robby cast himself upon his mother in a burst of gratitude promising
to bring her every berry he picked and not eat one Then they were all
packed into the haycart and went rattling away the brightest face
among the dozen being that of Rob as he sat between his two temporary
little mothers beaming upon the whole world and waving his best hat
for his indulgent mamma had not the heart to bereave him of it since
this was a galaday to him

Such a happy afternoon as they had in spite of the mishaps which
usually occur on such expeditions Of course Tommy came to grief
tumbled upon a hornets nest and got stung but being used to woe he
bore the smart manfully till Dan suggested the application of damp
earth which much assuaged the pain Daisy saw a snake and flying from
it lost half her berries but Demi helped her to fill up again and
discussed reptiles most learnedly the while Ned fell out of a tree and
split his jacket down the back but suffered no other fracture Emil and
Jack established rival claims to a certain thick patch and while they
were squabbling about it Stuffy quickly and quietly stripped the bushes
and fled to the protection of Dan who was enjoying himself immensely
The crutch was no longer necessary and he was delighted to see how
strong his foot felt as he roamed about the great pasture full of
interesting rocks and stumps with familiar little creatures in the
grass and wellknown insects dancing in the air

But of all the adventures that happened on this afternoon that which
befell Nan and Rob was the most exciting and it long remained one of
the favorite histories of the household Having explored the country
pretty generally torn three rents in her frock and scratched her face
in a barberrybush Nan began to pick the berries that shone like big
black beads on the low green bushes Her nimble fingers flew but
still her basket did not fill up as rapidly as she desired so she kept
wandering here and there to search for better places instead of picking
contentedly and steadily as Daisy did Rob followed Nan for her energy
suited him better than his cousins patience and he too was anxious to
have the biggest and best berries for Marmar

I keep putting em in but it dont fill up and Im so tired said
Rob pausing a moment to rest his short legs and beginning to think
huckleberrying was not all his fancy painted it for the sun blazed Nan
skipped hither and thither like a grasshopper and the berries fell out
of his pail almost as fast as he put them in because in his struggles
with the bushes it was often upsidedown

Last time we came they were ever so much thicker over that wall great
bouncers and there is a cave there where the boys made a fire Lets go
and fill our things quick and then hide in the cave and let the others
find us proposed Nan thirsting for adventures

Rob consented and away they went scrambling over the wall and running
down the sloping fields on the other side till they were hidden among
the rocks and underbrush The berries were thick and at last the pails
were actually full It was shady and cool down there and a little
spring gave the thirsty children a refreshing drink out of its mossy
cup

Now we will go and rest in the cave and eat our lunch said Nan well
satisfied with her success so far

Do you know the way asked Rob

Course I do Ive been once and I always remember Didnt I go and
get my box all right

That convinced Rob and he followed blindly as Nan led him over stock
and stone and brought him after much meandering to a small recess in
the rock where the blackened stones showed that fires had been made

Now isnt it nice asked Nan as she took out a bit of
breadandbutter rather damaged by being mixed up with nails
fishhooks stones and other foreign substances in the young ladys
pocket

Yes do you think they will find us soon asked Rob who found the
shadowy glen rather dull and began to long for more society

No I dont because if I hear them I shall hide and have fun making
them find me

Praps they wont come

Dont care I can get home myself

Is it a great way asked Rob looking at his little stubby boots
scratched and wet with his long wandering

Its six miles I guess Nans ideas of distance were vague and her
faith in her own powers great

I think we better go now suggested Rob presently

I shant till I have picked over my berries and Nan began what seemed
to Rob an endless task

Oh dear you said youd take good care of me he sighed as the sun
seemed to drop behind the hill all of a sudden

Well I am taking good care of you as hard as I can Dont be cross
child Ill go in a minute said Nan who considered fiveyearold
Robby a mere infant compared to herself

So little Rob sat looking anxiously about him and waiting patiently
for spite of some misgivings he felt great confidence in Nan

I guess its going to be night pretty soon he observed as if to
himself as a mosquito bit him and the frogs in a neighboring marsh
began to pipe up for the evening concert

My goodness me so it is Come right away this minute or they will be
gone cried Nan looking up from her work and suddenly perceiving that
the sun was down

I heard a horn about an hour ago may be they were blowing for us
said Rob trudging after his guide as she scrambled up the steep hill

Where was it asked Nan stopping short

Over that way he pointed with a dirty little finger in an entirely
wrong direction

Lets go that way and meet them and Nan wheeled about and began to
trot through the bushes feeling a trifle anxious for there were so
many cowpaths all about she could not remember which way they came

On they went over stock and stone again pausing now and then to listen
for the horn which did not blow any more for it was only the moo of a
cow on her way home

I dont remember seeing that pile of stones do you asked Nan as she
sat on a wall to rest a moment and take an observation

I dont remember any thing but I want to go home and Robs voice had
a little tremble in it that made Nan put her arms round him and lift him
gently down saying in her most capable way

Im going just as fast as I can dear Dont cry and when we come to
the road Ill carry you

Where is the road and Robby wiped his eyes to look for it

Over by that big tree Dont you know thats the one Ned tumbled out
of

So it is May be they waited for us Id like to ride home wouldnt
you and Robby brightened up as he plodded along toward the end of the
great pasture

No Id rather walk answered Nan feeling quite sure that she would
be obliged to do so and preparing her mind for it

Another long trudge through the fastdeepening twilight and another
disappointment for when they reached the tree they found to their
dismay that it was not the one Ned climbed and no road anywhere
appeared

Are we lost quavered Rob clasping his pail in despair

Not much I dont just see which way to go and I guess wed better
call

So they both shouted till they were hoarse yet nothing answered but the
frogs in full chorus

There is another tall tree over there perhaps thats the one said
Nan whose heart sunk within her though she still spoke bravely

I dont think I can go any more my boots are so heavy I cant pull
em and Robby sat down on a stone quite worn out

Then we must stay here all night I dont care much if snakes dont
come

Im frightened of snakes I cant stay all night Oh dear I dont
like to be lost and Rob puckered up his face to cry when suddenly a
thought occurred to him and he said in a tone of perfect confidence

Marmar will come and find me she always does I aint afraid now

She wont know where we are

She didnt know I was shut up in the icehouse but she found me
I know shell come returned Robby so trustfully that Nan felt
relieved and sat down by him saying with a remorseful sigh

I wish we hadnt run away

You made me but I dont mind much Marmar will love me just the same
answered Rob clinging to his sheetanchor when all other hope was gone

Im so hungry Lets eat our berries proposed Nan after a pause
during which Rob began to nod

So am I but I cant eat mine cause I told Marmar Id keep them all
for her

Youll have to eat them if no one comes for us said Nan who felt
like contradicting every thing just then If we stay here a great many
days we shall eat up all the berries in the field and then we shall
starve she added grimly

I shall eat sassafras I know a big tree of it and Dan told me how
squirrels dig up the roots and eat them and I love to dig returned
Rob undaunted by the prospect of starvation

Yes and we can catch frogs and cook them My father ate some once
and he said they were nice put in Nan beginning to find a spice of
romance even in being lost in a huckleberry pasture

How could we cook frogs we havent got any fire

I dont know next time Ill have matches in my pocket said Nan
rather depressed by this obstacle to the experiment in frogcookery

Couldnt we light a fire with a firefly asked Rob hopefully as he
watched them flitting to and fro like winged sparks

Lets try and several minutes were pleasantly spent in catching the
flies and trying to make them kindle a green twig or two Its a lie
to call them fireflies when there isnt a fire in them Nan said
throwing one unhappy insect away with scorn though it shone its best
and obligingly walked up and down the twigs to please the innocent
little experimenters

Marmars a good while coming said Rob after another pause during
which they watched the stars overhead smelt the sweet fern crushed
under foot and listened to the crickets serenade

I dont see why God made any night day is so much pleasanter said
Nan thoughtfully

Its to sleep in answered Rob with a yawn

Then do go to sleep said Nan pettishly

I want my own bed Oh I wish I could see Teddy cried Rob painfully
reminded of home by the soft chirp of birds safe in their little nests

I dont believe your mother will ever find us said Nan who was
becoming desperate for she hated patient waiting of any sort Its so
dark she wont see us

It was all black in the icehouse and I was so scared I didnt call
her but she saw me and she will see me now no matter how dark it is
returned confiding Rob standing up to peer into the gloom for the help
which never failed him

I see her I see her he cried and ran as fast as his tired legs
would take him toward a dark figure slowly approaching Suddenly he
stopped then turned about and came stumbling back screaming in a
great panic

No its a bear a big black one and hid his face in Nans skirts

For a moment Nan quailed ever her courage gave out at the thought of a
real bear and she was about to turn and flee in great disorder when a
mild Moo changed her fear to merriment as she said laughing

Its a cow Robby the nice black cow we saw this afternoon

The cow seemed to feel that it was not just the thing to meet two
little people in her pasture after dark and the amiable beast paused to
inquire into the case She let them stroke her and stood regarding them
with her soft eyes so mildly that Nan who feared no animal but a bear
was fired with a desire to milk her

Silas taught me how and berries and milk would be so nice she said
emptying the contents of her pail into her hat and boldly beginning her
new task while Rob stood by and repeated at her command the poem from
Mother Goose

 Cushy cow bonny let down your milk
 Let down your milk to me
 And I will give you a gown of silk
 A gown of silk and a silver tee

But the immortal rhyme had little effect for the benevolent cow had
already been milked and had only half a gill to give the thirsty
children

Shoo get away you are an old cross patch cried Nan ungratefully
as she gave up the attempt in despair and poor Molly walked on with a
gentle gurgle of surprise and reproof

Each can have a sip and then we must take a walk We shall go to sleep
if we dont and lost people mustnt sleep Dont you know how Hannah
Lee in the pretty story slept under the snow and died

But there isnt any snow now and its nice and warm said Rob who
was not blessed with as lively a fancy as Nan

No matter we will poke about a little and call some more and then
if nobody comes we will hide under the bushes like Hopomythumb and
his brothers

It was a very short walk however for Rob was so sleepy he could not
get on and tumbled down so often that Nan entirely lost patience being
half distracted by the responsibility she had taken upon herself

If you tumble down again Ill shake you she said lifting the poor
little man up very kindly as she spoke for Nans bark was much worse
than her bite

Please dont Its my boots they keep slipping so and Rob manfully
checked the sob just ready to break out adding with a plaintive
patience that touched Nans heart If the skeeters didnt bite me so I
could go to sleep till Marmar comes

Put your head on my lap and Ill cover you up with my apron Im not
afraid of the night said Nan sitting down and trying to persuade
herself that she did not mind the shadow nor the mysterious rustlings
all about her

Wake me up when she comes said rob and was fast asleep in five
minutes with his head in Nans lap under the pinafore

The little girl sat for some fifteen minutes staring about her with
anxious eyes and feeling as if each second was an hour Then a pale
light began to glimmer over the hilltop and she said to herself

I guess the night is over and morning is coming Id like to see the
sun rise so Ill watch and when it comes up we can find our way right
home

But before the moons round face peeped above the hill to destroy her
hope Nan had fallen asleep leaning back in a little bower of tall
ferns and was deep in a midsummer nights dream of fireflies and blue
aprons mountains of huckleberries and Robby wiping away the tears of a
black cow who sobbed I want to go home I want to go home

While the children were sleeping peacefully lulled by the drowsy hum of
many neighborly mosquitoes the family at home were in a great state of
agitation The haycart came at five and all but Jack Emil Nan and
Rob were at the bars ready for it Franz drove instead of Silas and
when the boys told him that the others were going home through the wood
he said looking illpleased They ought to have left Rob to ride he
will be tired out by the long walk

Its shorter that way and they will carry him said Stuffy who was
in a hurry for his supper

You are sure Nan and Rob went with them

Of course they did I saw them getting over the wall and sung out that
it was most five and Jack called back that they were going the other
way explained Tommy

Very well pile in then and away rattled the haycart with the tired
children and the full pails

Mrs Jo looked sober when she heard of the division of the party and
sent Franz back with Toby to find and bring the little ones home Supper
was over and the family sitting about in the cool hall as usual when
Franz came trotting back hot dusty and anxious

Have they come he called out when halfway up the avenue

No and Mrs Jo flew out of her chair looking so alarmed that every
one jumped up and gathered round Franz

I cant find them anywhere he began but the words were hardly spoken
when a loud Hullo startled them all and the next minute Jack and
Emil came round the house

Where are Nan and Rob cried Mrs Jo clutching Emil in a way that
caused him to think his aunt had suddenly lost her wits

I dont know They came home with the others didnt they he
answered quickly

No George and Tommy said they went with you

Well they didnt Havent seen them We took a swim in the pond and
came by the wood said Jack looking alarmed as well he might

Call Mr Bhaer get the lanterns and tell Silas I want him

That was all Mrs Jo said but they knew what she meant and flew to
obey her orders In ten minutes Mr Bhaer and Silas were off to the
wood and Franz tearing down the road on old Andy to search the great
pasture Mrs Jo caught up some food from the table a little bottle of
brandy from the medicinecloset took a lantern and bidding Jack and
Emil come with her and the rest not stir she trotted away on Toby
never stopping for hat or shawl She heard some one running after her
but said not a word till as she paused to call and listen the light of
her lantern shone on Dans face

You here I told Jack to come she said halfinclined to send him
back much as she needed help

I wouldnt let him he and Emil hadnt had any supper and I wanted
to come more than they did he said taking the lantern from her and
smiling up in her face with the steady look in his eyes that made her
feel as if boy though he was she had some one to depend on

Off she jumped and ordered him on to Toby in spite of his pleading to
walk then they went on again along the dusty solitary road stopping
every now and then to call and hearken breathlessly for little voices to
reply

When they came to the great pasture other lights were already flitting
to and fro like willothewisps and Mr Bhaers voice was heard
shouting Nan Rob Rob Nan in every part of the field Silas
whistled and roared Dan plunged here and there on Toby who seemed
to understand the case and went over the roughest places with unusual
docility Often Mrs Jo hushed them all saying with a sob in her
throat The noise may frighten them let me call Robby will know my
voice and then she would cry out the beloved little name in every tone
of tenderness till the very echoes whispered it softly and the winds
seemed to waft it willingly but still no answer came

The sky was overcast now and only brief glimpses of the moon were seen
heatlightening darted out of the dark clouds now and then and a faint
faroff rumble as of thunder told that a summerstorm was brewing

O my Robby my Robby mourned poor Mrs Jo wandering up and down like
a pale ghost while Dan kept beside her like a faithful firefly What
shall I say to Nans father if she comes to harm Why did I ever trust
my darling so far away Fritz do you hear any thing and when a
mournful No came back she wrung her hands so despairingly that Dan
sprung down from Tobys back tied the bridle to the bars and said in
his decided way

They may have gone down the spring Im going to look

He was over the wall and away so fast that she could hardly follow him
but when she reached the spot he lowered the lantern and showed her
with joy the marks of little feet in the soft ground about the spring
She fell down on her knees to examine the tracks and then sprung up
saying eagerly

Yes that is the mark of my Robbys little boots Come this way they
must have gone on

Such a weary search But now some inexplicable instinct seemed to lead
the anxious mother for presently Dan uttered a cry and caught up a
little shining object lying in the path It was the cover of the new
tin pail dropped in the first alarm of being lost Mrs Jo hugged and
kissed it as if it were a living thing and when Dan was about to utter
a glad shout to bring the others to the spot she stopped him saying
as she hurried on No let me find them I let Rob go and I want to
give him back to his father all myself

A little farther on Nans hat appeared and after passing the place
more than once they came at last upon the babes in the wood both sound
asleep Dan never forgot the little picture on which the light of his
lantern shone that night He thought Mrs Jo would cry out but she
only whispered Hush as she softly lifted away the apron and saw the
little ruddy face below The berrystained lips were halfopen as the
breath came and went the yellow hair lay damp on the hot forehead and
both the chubby hands held fast the little pail still full

The sight of the childish harvest treasured through all the troubles of
that night for her seemed to touch Mrs Jo to the heart for suddenly
she gathered up her boy and began to cry over him so tenderly yet
so heartily that he woke up and at first seemed bewildered Then he
remembered and hugged her close saying with a laugh of triumph

I knew youd come O Marmar I did want you so For a moment they
kissed and clung to one another quite forgetting all the world for no
matter how lost and soiled and wornout wandering sons may be mothers
can forgive and forget every thing as they fold them in their fostering
arms Happy the son whose faith in his mother remains unchanged and
who through all his wanderings has kept some filial token to repay her
brave and tender love

Dan meantime picked Nan out of her bush and with a gentleness none but
Teddy ever saw in him before he soothed her first alarm at the sudden
waking and wiped away her tears for Nan also began to cry for joy
it was so good to see a kind face and feel a strong arm round her after
what seemed to her ages of loneliness and fear

My poor little girl dont cry You are all safe now and no one
shall say a word of blame tonight said Mrs Jo taking Nan into her
capacious embrace and cuddling both children as a hen might gather her
lost chickens under her motherly wings

It was my fault but I am sorry I tried to take care of him and I
covered him up and let him sleep and didnt touch his berries though I
was so hungry and I never will do it again truly never never sobbed
Nan quite lost in a sea of penitence and thankfulness

Call them now and let us get home said Mrs Jo and Dan getting
upon the wall sent a joyful word Found ringing over the field

How the wandering lights came dancing from all sides and gathered
round the little group among the sweet fern bushes Such a hugging
and kissing and talking and crying as went on must have amazed the
glowworms and evidently delighted the mosquitoes for they hummed
frantically while the little moths came in flocks to the party and
the frogs croaked as if they could not express their satisfaction loudly
enough

Then they set out for home a queer party for Franz rode on to tell
the news Dan and Toby led the way then came Nan in the strong arms of
Silas who considered her the smartest little baggage he ever saw and
teased her all the way home about her pranks Mrs Bhaer would let no
one carry Rob but himself and the little fellow refreshed by sleep
sat up and chattered gayly feeling himself a hero while his mother
went beside him holding on to any pat of his precious little body that
came handy and never tired of hearing him say I knew Marmar would
come or seeing him lean down to kiss her and put a plump berry into
her mouth Cause he picked em all for her

The moon shone out just as they reached the avenue and all the boys
came shouting to meet them so the lost lambs were borne in triumph
and safety and landed in the diningroom where the unromantic little
things demanded supper instead of preferring kisses and caresses They
were set down to bread and milk while the entire household stood round
to gaze upon them Nan soon recovered her spirits and recounted her
perils with a relish now that they were all over Rob seemed absorbed in
his food but put down his spoon all of a sudden and set up a doleful
roar

My precious why do you cry asked his mother who still hung over
him

Im crying cause I was lost bawled Rob trying to squeeze out a
tear and failing entirely

But you are found now Nan says you didnt cry out in the field and I
was glad you were such a brave boy

I was so busy being frightened I didnt have any time then But I want
to cry now cause I dont like to be lost explained Rob struggling
with sleep emotion and a mouthful of bread and milk

The boys set up such a laugh at this funny way of making up for lost
time that Rob stopped to look at them and the merriment was so
infectious that after a surprised stare he burst out into a merry
Ha ha and beat his spoon upon the table as if he enjoyed the joke
immensely

It is ten oclock into bed every man of you said Mr Bhaer looking
at his watch

And thank Heaven there will be no empty ones tonight added Mrs
Bhaer watching with full eyes Robby going up in his fathers
arms and Nan escorted by Daisy and Demi who considered her the most
interesting heroine of their collection

Poor Aunt Jo is so tired she ought to be carried up herself said
gentle Franz putting his arm round her as she paused at the stairfoot
looking quite exhausted by her fright and long walk

Lets make an armchair proposed Tommy

No thank you my lads but somebody may lend me a shoulder to lean
on answered Mrs Jo

Me me and halfadozen jostled one another all eager to be chosen
for there was something in the pale motherly face that touched the warm
hearts under the round jackets

Seeing that they considered it an honor Mrs Jo gave it to the one who
had earned it and nobody grumbled when she put her arm on Dans broad
shoulder saying with a look that made him color up with pride and
pleasure

He found the children so I think he must help me up

Dan felt richly rewarded for his evenings work not only that he was
chosen from all the rest to go proudly up bearing the lamp but because
Mrs Jo said heartily Goodnight my boy God bless you as he left
her at her door

I wish I was your boy said Dan who felt as if danger and trouble had
somehow brought him nearer than ever to her

You shall be my oldest son and she sealed her promise with a kiss
that made Dan hers entirely

Little Rob was all right next day but Nan had a headache and lay on
Mother Bhaers sofa with coldcream upon her scratched face Her remorse
was quite gone and she evidently thought being lost rather a fine
amusement Mrs Jo was not pleased with this state of things and had no
desire to have her children led from the paths of virtue or her pupils
lying round loose in huckleberry fields So she talked soberly to Nan
and tried to impress upon her mind the difference between liberty and
license telling several tales to enforce her lecture She had not
decided how to punish Nan but one of these stories suggested a way and
as Mrs Jo liked odd penalties she tried it

All children run away pleaded Nan as if it was as natural and
necessary a thing as measles or hooping cough

Not all and some who do run away dont get found again answered Mrs
Jo

Didnt you do it yourself asked Nan whose keen little eyes saw some
traces of a kindred spirit in the serious lady who was sewing so morally
before her

Mrs Jo laughed and owned that she did

Tell about it demanded Nan feeling that she was getting the upper
hand in the discussion

Mrs Jo saw that and sobered down at once saying with a remorseful
shake of the head

I did it a good many times and led my poor mother rather a hard life
with my pranks till she cured me

How and Nan sat up with a face full of interest

I had a new pair of shoes once and wanted to show them so though I
was told not to leave the garden I ran away and was wandering about all
day It was in the city and why I wasnt killed I dont know Such a
time as I had I frolicked in the park with dogs sailed boats in the
Back Bay with strange boys dined with a little Irish beggargirl on
salt fish and potatoes and was found at last fast asleep on a doorstep
with my arms round a great dog It was late in the evening and I was a
dirty as a little pig and the new shoes were worn out I had travelled
so far

How nice cried Nan looking all ready to go and do it herself

It was not nice next day and Mrs Jo tried to keep her eyes from
betraying how much she enjoyed the memory of her early capers

Did your mother whip you asked Nan curiously

She never whipped me but once and then she begged my pardon or I
dont think I ever should have forgiven her it hurt my feelings so
much

Why did she beg your pardon my father dont

Because when she had done it I turned round and said Well you are
mad yourself and ought to be whipped as much as me She looked at me
a minute then her anger all died out and she said as if ashamed You
are right Jo I am angry and why should I punish you for being in a
passion when I set you such a bad example Forgive me dear and let us
try to help one another in a better way I never forgot it and it did
me more good than a dozen rods

Nan sat thoughtfully turning the little coldcream jar for a minute and
Mrs Jo said nothing but let that idea get well into the busy little
mind that was so quick to see and feel what went on about her

I like that said Nan presently and her face looked less elfish
with its sharp eyes inquisitive nose and mischievous mouth What did
your mother do to you when you ran away that time

She tied me to the bedpost with a long string so that I could not
go out of the room and there I stayed all day with the little wornout
shoes hanging up before me to remind me of my fault

I should think that would cure anybody cried Nan who loved her
liberty above all things

It did cure me and I think it will you so I am going to try it said
Mrs Jo suddenly taking a ball of strong twine out of a drawer in her
worktable

Nan looked as if she was decidedly getting the worst of the argument
now and sat feeling much crestfallen while Mrs Jo tied one end round
her waist and the other to the arm of the sofa saying as she finished

I dont like to tie you up like a naughty little dog but if you dont
remember any better than a dog I must treat you like one

Id just as lief be tied up as not I like to play dog and Nan put on
a dontcare face and began to growl and grovel on the floor

Mrs Jo took no notice but leaving a book or two and a handkerchief to
hem she went away and left Miss Nan to her own devices This was not
agreeable and after sitting a moment she tried to untie the cord But
it was fastened in the belt of her apron behind so she began on the
knot at the other end It soon came loose and gathering it up Nan was
about to get out of the window when she heard Mrs Jo say to somebody
as she passed through the hall

No I dont think she will run away now she is an honorable little
girl and knows that I do it to help her

In a minute Nan whisked back tied herself up and began to sew
violently Rob came in a moment after and was so charmed with the new
punishment that he got a jumprope and tethered himself to the other
arm of the sofa in the most social manner

I got lost too so I ought to be tied up as much as Nan he explained
to his mother when she saw the new captive

Im not sure that you dont deserve a little punishment for you knew
it was wrong to go far away from the rest

Nan took me began Rob willing to enjoy the novel penalty but not
willing to take the blame

You neednt have gone You have got a conscience though you are a
little boy and you must learn to mind it

Well my conscience didnt prick me a bit when she said Lets get over
the wall answered Rob quoting one of Demis expressions

Did you stop to see if it did

No

Then you cannot tell

I guess its such a little conscience that it dont prick hard enough
for me to feel it added Rob after thinking the matter over for a
minute

We must sharpen it up Its bad to have a dull conscience so you may
stay here till dinnertime and talk about it with Nan I trust you both
not to untie yourselves till I say the word

No we wont said both feeling a certain sense of virtue in helping
to punish themselves

For an hour they were very good then they grew tired of one room
and longed to get out Never had the hall seemed so inviting even the
little bedroom acquired a sudden interest and they would gladly have
gone in and played tent with the curtains of the best bed The open
windows drove them wild because they could not reach them and the outer
world seemed so beautiful they wondered how they ever found the
heart to say it was dull Nan pined for a race round the lawn and Rob
remembered with dismay that he had not fed his dog that morning and
wondered what poor Pollux would do They watched the clock and Nan did
some nice calculations in minutes and seconds while Rob learned to tell
all the hours between eight and one so well that he never forgot them
It was maddening to smell the dinner to know that there was to be
succotash and huckleberry pudding and to feel that they would not be
on the spot to secure good helps of both When Mary Ann began to set the
table they nearly cut themselves in two trying to see what meat there
was to be and Nan offered to help her make the beds if she would only
see that she had lots of sauce on her pudding

When the boys came bursting out of school they found the children
tugging at their halters like a pair of restive little colts and
were much edified as well as amused by the sequel to the exciting
adventures of the night

Untie me now Marmar my conscience will prick like a pin next time I
know it will said Rob as the bell rang and Teddy came to look at him
with sorrowful surprise

We shall see answered his mother setting him free He took a good
run down the hall back through the diningroom and brought up beside
Nan quite beaming with virtuous satisfaction

Ill bring her dinner to her may I he asked pitying his
fellowcaptive

Thats my kind little son Yes pull out the table and get a chair
and Mrs Jo hurried away to quell the ardor of the others who were
always in a raging state of hunger at noon

Nan ate alone and spent a long afternoon attached to the sofa Mrs
Bhaer lengthened her bonds so that she could look out of the window
and there she stood watching the boys play and all the little summer
creatures enjoying their liberty Daisy had a picnic for the dolls on
the lawn so that Nan might see the fun if she could not join in it
Tommy turned his best somersaults to console her Demi sat on the steps
reading aloud to himself which amused Nan a good deal and Dan brought
a little treetoad to show her as the most delicate attention in his
power

But nothing atoned for the loss of freedom and a few hours of
confinement taught Nan how precious it was A good many thoughts went
through the little head that lay on the windowsill during the last
quiet hour when all the children went to the brook to see Emils new
ship launched She was to have christened it and had depended on
smashing a tiny bottle of currantwine over the prow as it was named
Josephine in honor of Mrs Bhaer Now she had lost her chance and Daisy
wouldnt do it half so well Tears rose to her eyes as she remembered
that it was all her own fault and she said aloud addressing a fat
bee who was rolling about in the yellow heart of a rose just under the
window

If you have run away youd better go right home and tell your mother
you are sorry and never do so any more

I am glad to hear you give him such good advice and I think he has
taken it said Mrs Jo smiling as the bee spread his dusty wings and
flew away

Nan brushed off a bright drop or two that shone on the windowsill and
nestled against her friend as she took her on her knee adding kindly
for she had seen the little drops and knew what they meant

Do you think my mothers cure for running away a good one

Yes maam answered Nan quite subdued by her quiet day

I hope I shall not have to try it again

I guess not and Nan looked up with such an earnest little face that
Mrs Jo felt satisfied and said no more for she liked to have her
penalties do their own work and did not spoil the effect by too much
moralizing

Here Rob appeared bearing with infinite care what Asia called a sarcer
pie meaning one baked in a saucer

Its made out of some of my berries and Im going to give you half at
suppertime he announced with a flourish

What makes you when Im so naughty asked Nan meekly

Because we got lost together You aint going to be naughty again are
you

Never said Nan with great decision

Oh goody now lets go and get Mary Ann to cut this for us all ready
to eat its most tea time and Rob beckoned with the delicious little
pie

Nan started to follow then stopped and said

I forgot I cant go

Try and see said Mrs Bhaer who had quietly untied the cord sash
while she had been talking

Nan saw that she was free and with one tempestuous kiss to Mrs Jo she
was off like a hummingbird followed by Robby dribbling huckleberry
juice as he ran



CHAPTER XIII GOLDILOCKS

After the last excitement peace descended upon Plumfield and reigned
unbroken for several weeks for the elder boys felt that the loss of Nan
and Rob lay at their door and all became so paternal in their care
that they were rather wearying while the little ones listened to Nans
recital of her perils so many times that they regarded being lost as
the greatest ill humanity was heir to and hardly dared to put their
little noses outside the great gate lest night should suddenly descend
upon them and ghostly black cows come looming through the dusk

It is too good to last said Mrs Jo for years of boyculture had
taught her that such lulls were usually followed by outbreaks of some
sort and when less wise women would have thought that the boys had
become confirmed saints she prepared herself for a sudden eruption of
the domestic volcano

One cause of this welcome calm was a visit from little Bess whose
parents lent her for a week while they were away with Grandpa Laurence
who was poorly The boys regarded Goldilocks as a mixture of child
angel and fairy for she was a lovely little creature and the golden
hair which she inherited from her blonde mamma enveloped her like
a shining veil behind which she smiled upon her worshippers when
gracious and hid herself when offended Her father would not have it
cut and it hung below her waist so soft and fine and bright that Demi
insisted that it was silk spun from a cocoon Every one praised the
little Princess but it did not seem to do her harm only to teach her
that her presence brought sunshine her smiles made answering smiles
on other faces and her baby griefs filled every heart with tenderest
sympathy

Unconsciously she did her young subjects more good than many a real
sovereign for her rule was very gentle and her power was felt rather
than seen Her natural refinement made her dainty in all things and
had a good effect upon the careless lads about her She would let no one
touch her roughly or with unclean hands and more soap was used during
her visits than at any other time because the boys considered it the
highest honor to be allowed to carry her highness and the deepest
disgrace to be repulsed with the disdainful command Do away dirty
boy

Lour voices displeased her and quarrelling frightened her so gentler
tones came into the boyish voices as they addressed her and squabbles
were promptly suppressed in her presence by lookerson if the principles
could not restrain themselves She liked to be waited on and the
biggest boys did her little errands without a murmur while the small
lads were her devoted slaves in all things They begged to be allowed to
draw her carriage bear her berrybasket or pass her plate at table
No service was too humble and Tommy and Ned came to blows before they
could decide which should have the honor of blacking her little boots

Nan was especially benefited by a week in the society of a wellbred
lady though such a very small one for Bess would look at her with
a mixture of wonder and alarm in her great blue eyes when the hoyden
screamed and romped and she shrunk from her as if she thought her a
sort of wild animal Warmhearted Nan felt this very much She said at
first Pooh I dont care But she did care and was so hurt when Bess
said I love my tuzzin best tause she is twiet that she shook poor
Daisy till her teeth chattered in her head and then fled to the barn
to cry dismally In that general refuge for perturbed spirits she found
comfort and good counsel from some source or other Perhaps the swallows
from their mudbuilt nests overhead twittered her a little lecture on
the beauty of gentleness However that might have been she came out
quite subdued and carefully searched the orchard for a certain kind
of early apple that Bess liked because it was sweet and small and rosy
Armed with this peaceoffering she approached the little Princess and
humbly presented it To her great joy it was graciously accepted and
when Daisy gave Nan a forgiving kiss Bess did likewise as if she felt
that she had been too severe and desired to apologize After this they
played pleasantly together and Nan enjoyed the royal favor for days
To be sure she felt a little like a wild bird in a pretty cage at first
and occasionally had to slip out to stretch her wings in a long flight
or to sing at the top of her voice where neither would disturb the
plump turtledove Daisy nor the dainty golden canary Bess But it did
her good for seeing how every one loved the little Princess for her
small graces and virtues she began to imitate her because Nan wanted
much love and tried hard to win it

Not a boy in the house but felt the pretty childs influence and was
improved by it without exactly knowing how or why for babies can
work miracles in the hearts that love them Poor Billy found infinite
satisfaction in staring at her and though she did not like it she
permitted without a frown after she had been made to understand that he
was not quite like the others and on that account must be more kindly
treated Dick and Dolly overwhelmed her with willow whistles the only
thing they knew how to make and she accepted but never used them Rob
served her like a little lover and Teddy followed her like a pet dog
Jack she did not like because he was afflicted with warts and had a
harsh voice Stuffy displeased her because he did not eat tidily and
George tried hard not to gobble that he might not disgust the dainty
little lady opposite Ned was banished from court in utter disgrace when
he was discovered tormenting some unhappy fieldmice Goldilocks could
never forget the sad spectacle and retired behind her veil when he
approached waving him away with an imperious little hand and crying
in a tone of mingled grief and anger

No I tarnt love him he tut the poor mouses little tails off and
they queeked

Daisy promptly abdicated when Bess came and took the humble post of
chief cook while Nan was first maid of honor Emil was chancellor
of the exchequer and spent the public monies lavishly in getting up
spectacles that cost whole ninepences Franz was prime minister and
directed her affairs of state planned royal progresses through the
kingdom and kept foreign powers in order Demi was her philosopher and
fared much better than such gentlemen usually do among crowned heads
Dan was her standing army and defended her territories gallantly Tommy
was court fool and Nat a tuneful Rizzio to this innocent little Mary

Uncle Fritz and Aunt Jo enjoyed this peaceful episode and looked on
at the pretty play in which the young folk unconsciously imitated their
elders without adding the tragedy that is so apt to spoil the dramas
acted on the larger stage

They teach us quite as much as we teach them said Mr Bhaer

Bless the dears they never guess how many hints they give us as to the
best way of managing them answered Mrs Jo

I think you were right about the good effect of having girls among the
boys Nan has stirred up Daisy and Bess is teaching the little bears
how to behave better than we can If this reformation goes on as it
has begun I shall soon feel like Dr Blimber with his model young
gentlemen said Professor laughing as he saw Tommy not only remove
his own hat but knock off Neds also as they entered the hall where
the Princess was taking a ride on the rockinghorse attended by Rob
and Teddy astride of chairs and playing gallant knights to the best of
their ability

You will never be a Blimber Fritz you couldnt do it if you tried
and our boys will never submit to the forcing process of that famous
hotbed No fear that they will be too elegant American boys like
liberty too well But good manners they cannot fail to have if we give
them the kindly spirit that shines through the simplest demeanor making
it courteous and cordial like yours my dear old boy

Tut tut we will not compliment for if I begin you will run away and
I have a wish to enjoy this happy half hour to the end yet Mr Bhaer
looked pleased with the compliment for it was true and Mrs Jo felt
that she had received the best her husband could give her by saying
that he found his truest rest and happiness in her society

To return to the children I have just had another proof of Goldilocks
good influence said Mrs Jo drawing her chair nearer the sofa
where the Professor lay resting after a long days work in his various
gardens Nan hates sewing but for love of Bess has been toiling half
the afternoon over a remarkable bag in which to present a dozen of our
loveapples to her idol when she goes I praised her for it and she
said in her quick way I like to sew for other people it is stupid
sewing for myself I took the hint and shall give her some little
shirts and aprons for Mrs Carneys children She is so generous she
will sew her fingers sore for them and I shall not have to make a task
of it

But needlework is not a fashionable accomplishment my dear

Sorry for it My girls shall learn all I can teach them about it
even if they give up the Latin Algebra and halfadozen ologies it
is considered necessary for girls to muddle their poor brains over
nowadays Amy means to make Bess an accomplished woman but the dears
mite of a forefinger has little pricks on it already and her mother has
several specimens of needlework which she values more than the clay bird
without a bill that filled Laurie with such pride when Bess made it

I also have proof of the Princesss power said Mrs Bhaer after he
had watched Mrs Jo sew on a button with an air of scorn for the whole
system of fashionable education Jack is so unwilling to be classed
with Stuffy and Ned as distasteful to Bess that he came to me a little
while ago and asked me to touch his warts with caustic I have often
proposed it and he never would consent but now he bore the smart
manfully and consoles his present discomfort by hopes of future favor
when he can show her fastidious ladyship a smooth hand

Mrs Bhaer laughed at the story and just then Stuffy came in to ask if
he might give Goldilocks some of the bonbons his mother had sent him

She is not allowed to eat sweeties but if you like to give her the
pretty box with the pink sugarrose in it she would like it very much
said Mrs Jo unwilling to spoil this unusual piece of selfdenial for
the fat boy seldom offered to share his sugarplums

Wont she eat it I shouldnt like to make her sick said Stuffy
eyeing the delicate sweetmeat lovingly yet putting it into the box

Oh no she wont touch it if I tell her it is to look at not to eat
She will keep it for weeks and never think of tasting it Can you do as
much

I should hope so Im ever so much older than she is cried Stuffy
indignantly

Well suppose we try Here put your bonbons in this bag and see how
long you can keep them Let me count two hearts four red fishes three
barleysugar horses nine almonds and a dozen chocolate drops Do you
agree to that asked sly Mrs Jo popping the sweeties into her little
spoolbag

Yes said Stuffy with a sigh and pocketing the forbidden fruit
he went away to give Bess the present that won a smile from her and
permission to escort her round the garden

Poor Stuffys heart has really got the better of his stomach at last
and his efforts will be much encouraged by the rewards Bess gives him
said Mrs Jo

Happy is the man who can put temptation in his pocket and learn
selfdenial from so sweet a little teacher added Mr Bhaer as
the children passed the window Stuffys fat face full of placid
satisfaction and Goldilocks surveying her sugarrose with polite
interest though she would have preferred a real flower with a pitty
smell

When her father came to take her home a universal wail arose and the
parting gifts showered upon her increased her luggage to such an extent
that Mr Laurie proposed having out the big wagon to take it into town
Every one had given her something and it was found difficult to pack
white mice cake a parcel of shells apples a rabbit kicking violently
in a bag a large cabbage for his refreshment a bottle of minnows and
a mammoth bouquet The farewell scene was moving for the Princess sat
upon the halltable surrounded by her subjects She kissed her cousins
and held out her hand to the other boys who shook it gently with
various soft speeches for they were taught not to be ashamed of showing
their emotions

Come again soon little dear whispered Dan fastening his best
greenandgold beetle in her hat

Dont forget me Princess whatever you do said the engaging Tommy
taking a last stroke of the pretty hair

I am coming to your house next week and then I shall see you Bess
added Nat as if he found consolation in the thought

Do shake hands now cried Jack offering a smooth paw

Here are two nice new ones to remember us by said Dick and Dolly
presenting fresh whistles quite unconscious that seven old ones had
been privately deposited in the kitchenstove

My little precious I shall work you a bookmark right away and you
must keep it always said Nan with a warm embrace

But of all the farewells poor Billys was the most pathetic for the
thought that she was really going became so unbearable that he cast
himself down before her hugging her little blue boots and blubbering
despairingly Dont go away oh dont Goldilocks was so touched by
this burst of feeling that she leaned over and lifting the poor lads
head said in her soft little voice

Dont cry poor Billy I will tiss you and tum adain soon

This promise consoled Billy and he fell back beaming with pride at the
unusual honor conferred upon him

Me too me too clamored Dick and Dolly feeling that their devotion
deserved some return The others looked as if they would like to join
in the cry and something in the kind merry faces about her moved the
Princess to stretch out her arms and say with reckless condescension

I will tiss evvybody

Like a swarm of bees about a very sweet flower the affectionate lads
surrounded their pretty playmate and kissed her till she looked like a
little rose not roughly but so enthusiastically that nothing but the
crown of her hat was visible for a moment Then her father rescued her
and she drove away still smiling and waving her hands while the boys
sat on the fence screaming like a flock of guineafowls Come back
come back till she was out of sight

They all missed her and each dimly felt that he was better for having
known a creature so lovely delicate and sweet for little Bess
appealed to the chivalrous instinct in them as something to love
admire and protect with a tender sort of reverence Many a man
remembers some pretty child who has made a place in his heart and kept
her memory alive by the simple magic of her innocence these little men
were just learning to feel this power and to love it for its gentle
influence not ashamed to let the small hand lead them nor to own their
loyalty to womankind even in the bud



CHAPTER XIV DAMON AND PYTHIAS

Mrs Bhaer was right peace was only a temporary lull a storm was
brewing and two days after Bess left a moral earthquake shook
Plumfield to its centre

Tommys hens were at the bottom of the trouble for if they had not
persisted in laying so many eggs he could not have sold them and made
such sums Money is the root of all evil and yet it is such a useful
root that we cannot get on without it any more than we can without
potatoes Tommy certainly could not for he spent his income so
recklessly that Mr Bhaer was obliged to insist on a savingsbank and
presented him with a private one an imposing tin edifice with the name
over the door and a tall chimney down which the pennies were to
go there to rattle temptingly till leave was given to open a sort of
trapdoor in the floor

The house increased in weight so rapidly that Tommy soon became
satisfied with his investment and planned to buy unheardof treasures
with his capital He kept account of the sums deposited and was
promised that he might break the bank as soon as he had five dollars
on condition that he spent the money wisely Only one dollar was needed
and the day Mrs Jo paid him for four dozen eggs he was so delighted
that he raced off to the barn to display the bright quarters to Nat who
was also laying by money for the longdesired violin

I wish I had em to put with my three dollars then Id soon get enough
to buy my fiddle he said looking wistfully at the money

Praps Ill lend you some I havent decided yet what Ill do with
mine said Tommy tossing up his quarters and catching them as they
fell

Hi boys come down to the brook and see what a jolly great snake Dans
got called a voice from behind the barn

Come on said Tommy and laying his money inside the old winnowing
machine away he ran followed by Nat

The snake was very interesting and then a long chase after a lame
crow and its capture so absorbed Tommys mind and time that he never
thought of his money till he was safely in bed that night

Never mind no one but Nat knows where it is said the easygoing lad
and fell asleep untroubled by any anxiety about his property

Next morning just as the boys assembled for school Tommy rushed into
the room breathlessly demanding

I say who has got my dollar

What are you talking about asked Franz

Tommy explained and Nat corroborated his statement

Every one else declared they knew nothing about it and began to look
suspiciously at Nat who got more and more alarmed and confused with
each denial

Somebody must have taken it said Franz as Tommy shook his fist at
the whole party and wrathfully declared that

By thunder turtles if I get hold of the thief Ill give him what he
wont forget in a hurry

Keep cool Tom we shall find him out thieves always come to grief
said Dan as one who knew something of the matter

May be some tramp slept in the barn and took it suggested Ned

No Silas dont allow that besides a tramp wouldnt go looking in
that old machine for money said Emil with scorn

Wasnt it Silas himself said Jack

Well I like that Old Si is as honest as daylight You wouldnt catch
him touching a penny of ours said Tommy handsomely defending his
chief admirer from suspicion

Whoever it was had better tell and not wait to be found out said
Demi looking as if an awful misfortune had befallen the family

I know you think its me broke out Nat red and excited

You are the only one who knew where it was said Franz

I cant help it I didnt take it I tell you I didnt I didnt cried
Nat in a desperate sort of way

Gently gently my son What is all this noise about and Mr Bhaer
walked in among them

Tommy repeated the story of his loss and as he listened Mr Bhaers
face grew graver and graver for with all their faults and follies the
lads till now had been honest

Take your seats he said and when all were in their places he added
slowly as his eye went from face to face with a grieved look that was
harder to bear than a storm of words

Now boys I shall ask each one of you a single question and I want an
honest answer I am not going to try to frighten bribe or surprise the
truth out of you for every one of you have got a conscience and know
what it is for Now is the time to undo the wrong done to Tommy and
set yourselves right before us all I can forgive the yielding to sudden
temptation much easier than I can deceit Dont add a lie to the theft
but confess frankly and we will all try to help you make us forget and
forgive

He paused a moment and one might have heard a pin drop the room was
so still then slowly and impressively he put the question to each one
receiving the same answer in varying tones from all Every face was
flushed and excited so that Mr Bhaer could not take color as a
witness and some of the little boys were so frightened that they
stammered over the two short words as if guilty though it was evident
that they could not be When he came to Nat his voice softened for the
poor lad looked so wretched Mr Bhaer felt for him He believed him to
be the culprit and hoped to save the boy from another lie by winning
him to tell the truth without fear

Now my son give me an honest answer Did you take the money

No sir and Nat looked up at him imploringly

As the words fell from his trembling lips somebody hissed

Stop that cried Mr Bhaer with a sharp rap on his desk as he looked
sternly toward the corner whence the sound came

Ned Jack and Emil sat there and the first two looked ashamed of
themselves but Emil called out

It wasnt me uncle Id be ashamed to hit a fellow when he is down

Good for you cried Tommy who was in a sad state of affliction at the
trouble his unlucky dollar had made

Silence commanded Mr Bhaer and when it came he said soberly

I am very sorry Nat but evidences are against you and your old fault
makes us more ready to doubt you than we should be if we could trust you
as we do some of the boys who never fib But mind my child I do not
charge you with this theft I shall not punish you for it till I am
perfectly sure nor ask any thing more about it I shall leave it for
you to settle with your own conscience If you are guilty come to me at
any hour of the day or night and confess it and I will forgive and
help you to amend If you are innocent the truth will appear sooner or
later and the instant it does I will be the first to beg your pardon
for doubting you and will so gladly do my best to clear your character
before us all

I didnt I didnt sobbed Nat with his head down upon his arms for
he could not bear the look of distrust and dislike which he read in the
many eyes fixed on him

I hope not Mr Bhaer paused a minute as if to give the culprit
whoever he might be one more chance Nobody spoke however and only
sniffs of sympathy from some of the little fellows broke the silence
Mr Bhaer shook his head and added regretfully

There is nothing more to be done then and I have but one thing to
say I shall not speak of this again and I wish you all to follow my
example I cannot expect you to feel as kindly toward any one whom you
suspect as before this happened but I do expect and desire that you
will not torment the suspected person in any way he will have a hard
enough time without that Now go to your lessons

Father Bhaer let Nat off too easy muttered Ned to Emil as they got
out their books

Hold your tongue growled Emil who felt that this event was a blot
upon the family honor

Many of the boys agreed with Ned but Mr Bhaer was right nevertheless
and Nat would have been wiser to confess on the spot and have the
trouble over for even the hardest whipping he ever received from his
father was far easier to bear than the cold looks the avoidance and
general suspicion that met him on all sides If ever a boy was sent to
Coventry and kept there it was poor Nat and he suffered a week of slow
torture though not a hand was raised against him and hardly a word
said

That was the worst of it if they would only have talked it out or
even have thrashed him all round he could have stood it better than
the silent distrust that made very face so terrible to meet Even Mrs
Bhaers showed traces of it though her manner was nearly as kind as
ever but the sorrowful anxious look in Father Bhaers eyes cut Nat
to the heart for he loved his teacher dearly and knew that he had
disappointed all his hopes by this double sin

Only one person in the house entirely believed in him and stood up for
him stoutly against all the rest This was Daisy She could not explain
why she trusted him against all appearances she only felt that she
could not doubt him and her warm sympathy made her strong to take his
part She would not hear a word against him from any one and actually
slapped her beloved Demi when he tried to convince her that it must have
been Nat because no one else knew where the money was

Maybe the hens ate it they are greedy old things she said and when
Demi laughed she lost her temper slapped the amazed boy and then
burst out crying and ran away still declaring He didnt he didnt
he didnt

Neither aunt nor uncle tried to shake the childs faith in her friend
but only hoped her innocent instinct might prove sure and loved her all
the better for it Nat often said after it was over that he couldnt
have stood it if it had not been for Daisy When the others shunned
him she clung to him closer than ever and turned her back on the rest
She did not sit on the stairs now when he solaced himself with the old
fiddle but went in and sat beside him listening with a face so full of
confidence and affection that Nat forgot disgrace for a time and
was happy She asked him to help her with her lessons she cooked him
marvelous messes in her kitchen which he ate manfully no matter what
they were for gratitude gave a sweet flavor to the most distasteful
She proposed impossible games of cricket and ball when she found that
he shrank from joining the other boys She put little nosegays from her
garden on his desk and tried in every way to show that she was not a
fairweather friend but faithful through evil as well as good repute
Nan soon followed her example in kindness at least curbed her sharp
tongue and kept her scornful little nose from any demonstration of
doubt or dislike which was good of Madame Giddygaddy for she firmly
believed that Nat took the money

Most of the boys let him severely alone but Dan though he said he
despised him for being a coward watched over him with a grim sort of
protection and promptly cuffed any lad who dared to molest his mate or
make him afraid His idea of friendship was as high as Daisys and in
his own rough way he lived up to it as loyally

Sitting by the brook one afternoon absorbed in the study of the
domestic habits of waterspiders he overheard a bit of conversation on
the other side of the wall Ned who was intensely inquisitive had been
on tenterhooks to know certainly who was the culprit for of late one
or two of the boys had begun to think that they were wrong Nat was so
steadfast in his denials and so meek in his endurance of their neglect
This doubt had teased Ned past bearing and he had several times
privately beset Nat with questions regardless of Mr Bhaers express
command Finding Nat reading alone on the shady side of the wall Ned
could not resist stopping for a nibble at the forbidden subject He had
worried Nat for some ten minutes before Dan arrived and the first words
the spiderstudent heard were these in Nats patient pleading voice

Dont Ned oh dont I cant tell you because I dont know and its
mean of you to keep nagging at me on the sly when Father Bhaer told you
not to plague me You wouldnt dare to if Dan was round

I aint afraid of Dan hes nothing but an old bully Dont believe but
what he took Toms money and you know it and wont tell Come now

He didnt but if he did I would stand up for him he has always been
so good to me said Nat so earnestly that Dan forgot his spiders and
rose quickly to thank him but Neds next words arrested him

I know Dan did it and gave the money to you Shouldnt wonder if he
got his living picking pockets before he came here for nobody knows
any thing about him but you said Ned not believing his own words but
hoping to get the truth out of Nat by making him angry

He succeeded in a part of his ungenerous wish for Nat cried out
fiercely

If you say that again Ill go and tell Mr Bhaer all about it I dont
want to tell tales but by George I will if you dont let Dan alone

Then youll be a sneak as well as a liar and a thief began Ned with
a jeer for Nat had borne insult to himself so meekly the other did not
believe he would dare to face the master just to stand up for Dan

What he might have added I cannot tell for the words were hardly out
of his mouth when a long arm from behind took him by the collar and
jerking him over the wall in a most promiscuous way landed him with a
splash in the middle of the brook

Say that again and Ill duck you till you cant see cried Dan
looking like a modern Colossus of Rhodes as he stood with a foot on
either side of the narrow stream glaring down at the discomfited youth
in the water

I was only in fun said Ned

You are a sneak yourself to badger Nat round the corner Let me catch
you at it again and Ill souse you in the river next time Get up and
clear out thundered Dan in a rage

Ned fled dripping and his impromptu sitzbath evidently did him good
for he was very respectful to both the boys after that and seemed to
have left his curiosity in the brook As he vanished Dan jumped over the
wall and found Nat lying as if quite worn out and bowed down with his
troubles

He wont pester you again I guess If he does just tell me and Ill
see to him said Dan trying to cool down

I dont mind what he says about me so much Ive got used to it
answered Nat sadly but I hate to have him pitch into you

How do you know he isnt right asked Dan turning his face away

What about the money cried Nat looking up with a startled air

Yes

But I dont believe it You dont care for money all you want is your
old bugs and things and Nat laughed incredulously

I want a butterfly net as much as you want a fiddle why shouldnt I
steal the money for it as much as you said Dan still turning away
and busily punching holes in the turf with his stick

I dont think you would You like to fight and knock folks round
sometimes but you dont lie and I dont believe youd steal and Nat
shook his head decidedly

Ive done both I used to fib like fury its too much trouble now and
I stole things to eat out of gardens when I ran away from Page so you
see I am a bad lot said Dan speaking in the rough reckless way which
he had been learning to drop lately

O Dan dont say its you Id rather have it any of the other boys
cried Nat in such a distressed tone that Dan looked pleased and showed
that he did by turning round with a queer expression in his face
though he only answered

I wont say any thing about it But dont you fret and well pull
through somehow see if we dont

Something in his face and manner gave Nat a new idea and he said
pressing his hands together in the eagerness of his appeal

I think you know who did it If you do beg him to tell Dan Its so
hard to have em all hate me for nothing I dont think I can bear it
much longer If I had any place to go to Id run away though I love
Plumfield dearly but Im not brave and big like you so I must stay and
wait till some one shows them that I havent lied

As he spoke Nat looked so broken and despairing that Dan could not
bear it and muttered huskily

You wont wait long and he walked rapidly away and was seen no more
for hours

What is the matter with Dan asked the boys of one another several
times during the Sunday that followed a week which seemed as if it would
never end Dan was often moody but that day he was so sober and silent
that no one could get any thing out of him When they walked he strayed
away from the rest and came home late He took no part in the evening
conversation but sat in the shadow so busy with his own thoughts that
he scarcely seemed to hear what was going on When Mrs Jo showed him an
unusually good report in the Conscience Book he looked at it without a
smile and said wistfully

You think I am getting on dont you

Excellently Dan and I am so pleased because I always thought you
only needed a little help to make you a boy to be proud of

He looked up at her with a strange expression in his black eyes an
expression of mingled pride and love and sorrow which she could not
understand then but remembered afterward

Im afraid youll be disappointed but I do try he said shutting the
book with no sign of pleasure in the page that he usually liked so much
to read over and talk about

Are you sick dear asked Mrs Jo with her hand on his shoulder

My foot aches a little I guess Ill go to bed Goodnight mother
he added and held the hand against his cheek a minute then went away
looking as if he had said goodbye to something dear

Poor Dan he takes Nats disgrace to heart sadly He is a strange boy
I wonder if I ever shall understand him thoroughly said Mrs Jo
to herself as she thought over Dans late improvement with real
satisfaction yet felt that there was more in the lad than she had at
first suspected

One of things which cut Nat most deeply was an act of Tommys for after
his loss Tommy had said to him kindly but firmly

I dont wish to hurt you Nat but you see I cant afford to lose my
money so I guess we wont be partners any longer and with that Tommy
rubbed out the sign T Bangs  Co

Nat had been very proud of the Co and had hunted eggs industriously
kept his accounts all straight and had added a good sum to his income
from the sale of his share of stock in trade

O Tom must you he said feeling that his good name was gone for ever
in the business world if this was done

I must returned Tommy firmly Emil says that when one man bezzles
believe thats the word it means to take money and cut away with it
the property of a firm the other one sues him or pitches into him
somehow and wont have any thing more to do with him Now you have
bezzled my property I shant sue you and I shant pitch into you but
I must dissolve the partnership because I cant trust you and I dont
wish to fail

I cant make you believe me and you wont take my money though Id be
thankful to give all my dollars if youd only say you dont think I took
your money Do let me hunt for you I wont ask any wages but do it for
nothing I know all the places and I like it pleaded Nat

But Tommy shook his head and his jolly round face looked suspicious and
hard as he said shortly Cant do it wish you didnt know the places
Mind you dont go hunting on the sly and speculate in my eggs

Poor Nat was so hurt that he could not get over it He felt that he had
lost not only his partner and patron but that he was bankrupt in honor
and an outlaw from the business community No one trusted his word
written or spoken in spite of his efforts to redeem the past falsehood
the sign was down the firm broken up and he a ruined man The barn
which was the boys Wall Street knew him no more Cockletop and
her sisters cackled for him in vain and really seemed to take his
misfortune to heart for eggs were fewer and some of the biddies
retired in disgust to new nests which Tommy could not find

They trust me said Nat when he heard of it and though the boys
shouted at the idea Nat found comfort in it for when one is down in
the world the confidence of even a speckled hen is most consoling

Tommy took no new partner however for distrust had entered in and
poisoned the peace of his once confiding soul Ned offered to join him
but he declined saying with a sense of justice that did him honor

It might turn out that Nat didnt take my money and then we could
be partners again I dont think it will happen but I will give him a
chance and keep the place open a little longer

Billy was the only person whom Bangs felt he could trust in his shop
and Billy was trained to hunt eggs and hand them over unbroken being
quite satisfied with an apple or a sugarplum for wages The morning
after Dans gloomy Sunday Billy said to his employer as he displayed
the results of a long hunt

Only two

It gets worse and worse I never saw such provoking old hens growled
Tommy thinking of the days when he often had six to rejoice over
Well put em in my hat and give me a new bit of chalk I must mark em
up any way

Billy mounted a peckmeasure and looked into the top of the machine
where Tommy kept his writing materials

Theres lots of money in here said Billy

No there isnt Catch me leaving my cash round again returned Tommy

I see em one four eight two dollars persisted Billy who had not
yet mastered the figures correctly

What a jack you are and Tommy hopped up to get the chalk for himself
but nearly tumbled down again for there actually were four bright
quarters in a row with a bit of paper on them directed to Tom Bangs
that there might be no mistake

Thunder turtles cried Tommy and seizing them he dashed into the
house bawling wildly Its all right Got my money Wheres Nat

He was soon found and his surprise and pleasure were so genuine that
few doubted his word when he now denied all knowledge of the money

How could I put it back when I didnt take it Do believe me now and
be good to me again he said so imploringly that Emil slapped him on
the back and declared he would for one

So will I and Im jolly glad its not you But who the dickens is it
said Tommy after shaking hands heartily with Nat

Never mind as long as its found said Dan with his eyes fixed on
Nats happy face

Well I like that Im not going to have my things hooked and then
brought back like the juggling mans tricks cried Tommy looking at
his money as if he suspected witchcraft

Well find him out somehow though he was sly enough to print this so
his writing wouldnt be known said Franz examining the paper

Demi prints tiptop put in Rob who had not a very clear idea what
the fuss was all about

You cant make me believe its him not if you talk till you are blue
said Tommy and the others hooted at the mere idea for the little
deacon as they called him was above suspicion

Nat felt the difference in the way they spoke of Demi and himself and
would have given all he had or ever hoped to have to be so trusted
for he had learned how easy it is to lose the confidence of others how
very very hard to win it back and truth became to him a precious thing
since he had suffered from neglecting it

Mr Bhaer was very glad one step had been taken in the right direction
and waited hopefully for yet further revelations They came sooner than
he expected and in a way that surprised and grieved him very much As
they sat at supper that night a square parcel was handed to Mrs Bhaer
from Mrs Bates a neighbor A note accompanied the parcel and while
Mr Bhaer read it Demi pulled off the wrapper exclaiming as he saw
its contents

Why its the book Uncle Teddy gave Dan

The devil broke from Dan for he had not yet quite cured himself of
swearing though he tried very hard

Mr Bhaer looked up quickly at the sound Dan tried to meet his eyes
but could not his own fell and he sat biting his lips getting redder
and redder till he was the picture of shame

What is it asked Mrs Bhaer anxiously

I should have preferred to talk about this in private but Demi has
spoilt that plan so I may as well have it out now said Mr Bhaer
looking a little stern as he always did when any meanness or deceit
came up for judgment

The note is from Mrs Bates and she says that her boy Jimmy told her
he bought this book of Dan last Saturday She saw that it was worth much
more than a dollar and thinking there was some mistake has sent it to
me Did you sell it Dan

Yes sir was the slow answer

Why

Wanted money

For what

To pay somebody

To whom did you owe it

Tommy

Never borrowed a cent of me in his life cried Tommy looked scared
for he guessed what was coming now and felt that on the whole he would
have preferred witchcraft for he admired Dan immensely

Perhaps he took it cried Ned who owed Dan a grudge for the ducking
and being a mortal boy liked to pay it off

O Dan cried Nat clasping his hands regardless of the bread and
butter in them

It is a hard thing to do but I must have this settled for I cannot
have you watching each other like detectives and the whole school
disturbed in this way did you put that dollar in the barn this
morning asked Mr Bhaer

Dan looked him straight in the face and answered steadily Yes I
did

A murmur went round the table Tommy dropped his mug with a crash Daisy
cried out I knew it wasnt Nat Nan began to cry and Mrs Jo left
the room looking so disappointed sorry and ashamed that Dan could not
bear it He hid his face in his hands a moment then threw up his head
squared his shoulders as if settling some load upon them and said with
the dogged look and halfresolute halfreckless tone he had used when
he first came

I did it now you may do what you like to me but I wont say another
word about it

Not even that you are sorry asked Mr Bhaer troubled by the change
in him

I aint sorry

Ill forgive him without asking said Tommy feeling that it was
harder somehow to see brave Dan disgraced than timid Nat

Dont want to be forgiven returned Dan gruffly

Perhaps you will when you have thought about it quietly by yourself I
wont tell you now how surprised and disappointed I am but by and by I
will come up and talk to you in your room

Wont make any difference said Dan trying to speak defiantly but
failing as he looked at Mr Bhaers sorrowful face and taking his
words for a dismissal Dan left the room as if he found it impossible to
stay

It would have done him good if he had stayed for the boys talked the
matter over with such sincere regret and pity and wonder it might
have touched and won him to ask pardon No one was glad to find that it
was he not even Nat for spite of all his faults and they were many
every one liked Dan now because under his rough exterior lay some of
the manly virtues which we most admire and love Mrs Jo had been the
chief prop as well as cultivator of Dan and she took it sadly to
heart that her last and most interesting boy had turned out so ill The
theft was bad but the lying about it and allowing another to suffer
so much from an unjust suspicion was worse and most discouraging of all
was the attempt to restore the money in an underhand way for it showed
not only a want of courage but a power of deceit that boded ill for the
future Still more trying was his steady refusal to talk of the matter
to ask pardon or express any remorse Days passed and he went about
his lessons and his work silent grim and unrepentant As if taking
warning by their treatment of Nat he asked no sympathy of any one
rejected the advances of the boys and spent his leisure hours roaming
about the fields and woods trying to find playmates in the birds and
beasts and succeeding better than most boys would have done because he
knew and loved them so well

If this goes on much longer Im afraid he will run away again for he
is too young to stand a life like this said Mr Bhaer quite dejected
at the failure of all his efforts

A little while ago I should have been quite sure that nothing would
tempt him away but now I am ready of any thing he is so changed
answered poor Mrs Jo who mourned over her boy and could not be
comforted because he shunned her more than any one else and only
looked at her with the halffierce halfimploring eyes of a wild animal
caught in a trap when she tried to talk to him alone

Nat followed him about like a shadow and Dan did not repulse him as
rudely as he did others but said in his blunt way You are all right
dont worry about me I can stand it better than you did

But I dont like to have you all alone Nat would say sorrowfully

I like it and Dan would tramp away stifling a sigh sometimes for he
was lonely

Passing through the birch grove one day he came up on several of the
boys who were amusing themselves by climbing up the trees and swinging
down again as they slender elastic stems bent till their tops touched
the ground Dan paused a minute to watch the fun without offering
to join in it and as he stood there Jack took his turn He had
unfortunately chosen too large a tree for when he swung off it only
bent a little way and left him hanging at a dangerous height

Go back you cant do it called Ned from below

Jack tried but the twigs slipped from his hands and he could not get
his legs round the trunk He kicked and squirmed and clutched in vain
then gave it up and hung breathless saying helplessly

Catch me help me I must drop

Youll be killed if you do cried Ned frightened out of his wits

Hold on shouted Dan and up the tree he went crashing his way along
till he nearly reached Jack whose face looked up at him full of fear
and hope

Youll both come down said Ned dancing with excitement on the slope
underneath while Nat held out his arms in the wild hope of breaking
the fall

Thats what I want stand from under answered Dan coolly and as he
spoke his added weight bent the tree many feet nearer the earth

Jack dropped safely but the birch lightened of half its load flew up
again so suddenly that Dan in the act of swinging round to drop feet
foremost lost his hold and fell heavily

Im not hurt all right in a minute he said sitting up a little
pale and dizzy as the boys gathered round him full of admiration and
alarm

Youre a trump Dan and Im ever so much obliged to you cried Jack
gratefully

It wasnt any thing muttered Dan rising slowly

I say it was and Ill shake hands with you though you are Ned
checked the unlucky word on his tongue and held out his hand feeling
that it was a handsome thing on his part

But I wont shake hands with a sneak and Dan turned his back with a
look of scorn that caused Ned to remember the brook and retire with
undignified haste

Come home old chap Ill give you a lift and Nat walked away with
him leaving the others to talk over the feat together to wonder when
Dan would come round and to wish one and all that Tommys confounded
money had been in Jericho before it made such a fuss

When Mr Bhaer came into school next morning he looked so happy that
the boys wondered what had happened to him and really thought he had
lost his mind when they saw him go straight to Dan and taking him by
both hands say all in one breath as he shook them heartily

I know all about it and I beg your pardon It was like you to do it
and I love you for it though its never right to tell lies even for a
friend

What is it cried Nat for Dan said not a word only lifted up his
head as if a weight of some sort had fallen off his back

Dan did not take Tommys money and Mr Bhaer quite shouted it he was
so glad

Who did cried the boys in a chorus

Mr Bhaer pointed to one empty seat and every eye followed his finger
yet no one spoke for a minute they were so surprised

Jack went home early this morning but he left this behind him and
in the silence Mr Bhaer read the note which he had found tied to his
doorhandle when he rose

I took Tommys dollar I was peeking in through a crack and saw him put
it there I was afraid to tell before though I wanted to I didnt care
so much about Nat but Dan is a trump and I cant stand it any longer
I never spent the money its under the carpet in my room right behind
the washstand Im awful sorry I am going home and dont think I shall
ever come back so Dan may have my things

JACK

It was not an elegant confession being badly written much blotted
and very short but it was a precious paper to Dan and when Mr Bhaer
paused the boy went to him saying in a rather broken voice but with
clear eyes and the frank respectful manner they had tried to teach
him

Ill say Im sorry now and ask you to forgive me sir

It was a kind lie Dan and I cant help forgiving it but you see it
did no good said Mr Bhaer with a hand on either shoulder and a face
full of relief and affection

It kept the boys from plaguing Nat Thats what I did it for It made
him right down miserable I didnt care so much explained Dan as if
glad to speak out after his hard silence

How could you do it You are always so kind to me faltered Nat
feeling a strong desire to hug his friend and cry Two girlish
performances which would have scandalized Dan to the last degree

Its all right now old fellow so dont be a fool he said
swallowing the lump in his throat and laughing out as he had not done
for weeks Does Mrs Bhaer know he asked eagerly

Yes and she is so happy I dont know what she will do to you began
Mr Bhaer but got no farther for here the boys came crowding about Dan
in a tumult of pleasure and curiosity but before he had answered more
than a dozen questions a voice cried out

Three cheers for Dan and there was Mrs Jo in the doorway waving her
dishtowel and looking as if she wanted to dance a jig for joy as she
used to do when a girl

Now then cried Mr Bhaer and led off a rousing hurrah which
startled Asia in the kitchen and made old Mr Roberts shake his head as
he drove by saying

Schools are not what they were when I was young

Dan stood it pretty well for a minute but the sight of Mrs Jos
delight upset him and he suddenly bolted across the hall into the
parlor whither she instantly followed and neither were seen for half
an hour

Mr Bhaer found it very difficult to calm his excited flock and seeing
that lessons were an impossibility for a time he caught their attention
by telling them the fine old story of the friends whose fidelity to one
another has made their names immortal The lads listened and remembered
for just then their hearts were touched by the loyalty of a humbler pair
of friends The lie was wrong but the love that prompted it and the
courage that bore in silence the disgrace which belonged to another
made Dan a hero in their eyes Honesty and honor had a new meaning now
a good name was more precious than gold for once lost money could not
buy it back and faith in one another made life smooth and happy as
nothing else could do

Tommy proudly restored the name of the firm Nat was devoted to Dan and
all the boys tried to atone to both for former suspicion and neglect
Mrs Jo rejoiced over her flock and Mr Bhaer was never tired of
telling the story of his young Damon and Pythias



CHAPTER XV IN THE WILLOW

The old tree saw and heard a good many little scenes and confidences
that summer because it became the favorite retreat of all the children
and the willow seemed to enjoy it for a pleasant welcome always met
them and the quiet hours spent in its arms did them all good It had
a great deal of company one Saturday afternoon and some little bird
reported what went on there

First came Nan and Daisy with their small tubs and bits of soap for
now and then they were seized with a tidy fit and washed up all their
dolls clothes in the brook Asia would not have them slopping round
in her kitchen and the bathroom was forbidden since Nan forgot to turn
off the water till it overflowed and came gently dripping down through
the ceiling Daisy went systematically to work washing first the white
and then the colored things rinsing them nicely and hanging them to
dry on a cord fastened from one barberrybush to another and pinning
them up with a set of tiny clothespins Ned had turned for her But Nan
put all her little things to soak in the same tub and then forgot them
while she collected thistledown to stuff a pillow for Semiramis Queen
of Babylon as one doll was named This took some time and when Mrs
Giddygaddy came to take out her clothes deep green stains appeared on
every thing for she had forgotten the green silk lining of a certain
cape and its color had soaked nicely into the pink and blue gowns the
little chemises and even the best ruffled petticoat

Oh me what a mess sighed Nan

Lay them on the grass to bleach said Daisy with an air of
experience

So I will and we can sit up in the nest and watch that they dont blow
away

The Queen of Babylons wardrobe was spread forth upon the bank and
turning up their tubs to dry the little washerwomen climbed into the
nest and fell to talking as ladies are apt to do in the pauses of
domestic labor

Im going to have a featherbed to go with my new pillow said Mrs
Giddygaddy as she transferred the thistledown from her pocket to her
handkerchief losing about half in the process

I wouldnt Aunt Jo says featherbeds arent healthy I never let my
children sleep on any thing but a mattress returned Mrs Shakespeare
Smith decidedly

I dont care my children are so strong they often sleep on the
floor and dont mind it which was quite true I cant afford nine
mattresses and I like to make beds myself

Wont Tommy charge for the feathers

May be he will but I shant pay him and he wont care returned Mrs
G taking a base advantage of the wellknown good nature of T Bangs

I think the pink will fade out of that dress sooner than the green mark
will observed Mrs S looking down from her perch and changing the
subject for she and her gossip differed on many points and Mrs Smith
was a discreet lady

Never mind Im tired of dolls and I guess I shall put them all away
and attend to my farm I like it rather better than playing house said
Mrs G unconsciously expressing the desire of many older ladies who
cannot dispose of their families so easily however

But you mustnt leave them they will die without their mother cried
the tender Mrs Smith

Let em die then Im tired of fussing over babies and Im going
to play with the boys they need me to see to em returned the
strongminded lady

Daisy knew nothing about womens rights she quietly took all she
wanted and no one denied her claim because she did not undertake what
she could not carry out but unconsciously used the allpowerful right
of her own influence to win from others any privilege for which she
had proved her fitness Nan attempted all sorts of things undaunted by
direful failures and clamored fiercely to be allowed to do every thing
that the boys did They laughed at her hustled her out of the way and
protested against her meddling with their affairs But she would not be
quenched and she would be heard for her will was strong and she had
the spirit of a rampant reformer Mrs Bhaer sympathized with her but
tired to curb her frantic desire for entire liberty showing her that
she must wait a little learn selfcontrol and be ready to use her
freedom before she asked for it Nan had meek moments when she agreed to
this and the influences at work upon her were gradually taking effect
She no longer declared that she would be enginedriver or a blacksmith
but turned her mind to farming and found in it a vent for the energy
bottled up in her active little body It did not quite satisfy her
however for her sage and sweet marjoram were dumb things and could not
thank her for her care She wanted something human to love work for
and protect and was never happier than when the little boys brought
their cut fingers bumped heads or bruised joints for her to mendup
Seeing this Mrs Jo proposed that she should learn how to do it nicely
and Nursey had an apt pupil in bandaging plastering and fomenting The
boys began to call her Dr Giddygaddy and she liked it so well that
Mrs Jo one day said to the Professor

Fritz I see what we can do for that child She wants something to live
for even now and will be one of the sharp strong discontented women
if she does not have it Dont let us snub her restless little nature
but do our best to give her the work she likes and by and by persuade
her father to let her study medicine She will make a capital doctor
for she has courage strong nerves a tender heart and an intense love
and pity for the weak and suffering

Mr Bhaer smiled at first but agreed to try and gave Nan an
herbgarden teaching her the various healing properties of the plants
she tended and letting her try their virtues on the children in
the little illnesses they had from time to time She learned fast
remembered well and showed a sense and interest most encouraging to
her Professor who did not shut his door in her face because she was a
little woman

She was thinking of this as she sat in the willow that day and when
Daisy said in her gentle way

I love to keep house and mean to have a nice one for Demi when we grow
up and live together

Nan replied with decision

Well I havent got any brother and I dont want any house to fuss
over I shall have an office with lots of bottles and drawers and
pestle things in it and I shall drive round in a horse and chaise and
cure sick people That will be such fun

Ugh how can you bear the badsmelling stuff and the nasty little
powders and castoroil and senna and hive syrup cried Daisy with a
shudder

I shant have to take any so I dont care Besides they make people
well and I like to cure folks Didnt my sagetea make Mother Bhaers
headache go away and my hops stop Neds toothache in five hours So
now

Shall you put leeches on people and cut off legs and pull out teeth
asked Daisy quaking at the thought

Yes I shall do every thing I dont care if the people are all smashed
up I shall mend them My grandpa was a doctor and I saw him sew a
great cut in a mans cheek and I held the sponge and wasnt frightened
a bit and Grandpa said I was a brave girl

How could you Im sorry for sick people and I like to nurse them
but it makes my legs shake so I have to run away Im not a brave girl
sighed Daisy

Well you can be my nurse and cuddle my patients when I have given
them the physic and cut off their legs said Nan whose practice was
evidently to be of the heroic kind

Ship ahoy Where are you Nan called a voice from below

Here we are

Ay ay said the voice and Emil appeared holding one hand in the
other with his face puckered up as if in pain

Oh whats the matter cried Daisy anxiously

A confounded splinter in my thumb Cant get it out Take a pick at it
will you Nanny

Its in very deep and I havent any needle said Nan examining a
tarry thumb with interest

Take a pin said Emil in a hurry

No its too big and hasnt got a sharp point

Here Daisy who had dived into her pocket presented a neat little
housewife with four needles in it

You are the Posy who always has what we want said Emil and Nan
resolved to have a needlebook in her own pocket henceforth for just
such cases as this were always occurring in her practice

Daisy covered her eyes but Nan probed and picked with a steady hand
while Emil gave directions not down in any medical work or record

Starboard now Steady boys steady Try another tack Heave ho there
she is

Suck it ordered the Doctor surveying the splinter with an
experienced eye

Too dirty responded the patient shaking his bleeding hand

Wait Ill tie it up if you have got a handkerchief

Havent take one of those rags down there

Gracious no indeed they are dolls clothes cried Daisy
indignantly

Take one of mine Id like to have you said Nan and swinging himself
down Emil caught up the first rag he saw It happened to be the
frilled skirt but Nan tore it up without a murmur and when the royal
petticoat was turned into a neat little bandage she dismissed her
patient with the command

Keep it wet and let it alone then it will heal right up and not be
sore

What do you charge asked the Commodore laughing

Nothing I keep a spensary that is a place where poor people are
doctored free gratis for nothing explained Nan with an air

Thank you Doctor Giddygaddy Ill always call you in when I come
to grief and Emil departed but looked back to say for one good turn
deserves another Your duds are blowing away Doctor

Forgiving the disrespectful word duds the ladies hastily descended
and gathering up their wash retired to the house to fire up the little
stove and go to ironing

A passing breath of air shook the old willow as if it laughed softly
at the childish chatter which went on in the nest and it had hardly
composed itself when another pair of birds alighted for a confidential
twitter

Now Ill tell you the secret began Tommy who was swellin wisibly
with the importance of his news

Tell away answered Nat wishing he had brought his fiddle it was so
shady and quiet here

Well we fellows were talking over the late interesting case of
circumstantial evidence said Tommy quoting at random from a speech
Franz had made at the club and I proposed giving Dan something to
make up for our suspecting him to show our respect and so on you know
something handsome and useful that he could keep always and be proud
of What do you think we chose

A butterflynet he wants one ever so much said Nat looking a little
disappointed for he meant to get it himself

No sir its to be a microscope a real swell one that we see
whatdoyoucallems in water with and stars and anteggs and all
sorts of games you know Wont it be a jolly good present said Tommy
rather confusing microscopes and telescopes in his remarks

Tiptop Im so glad Wont it cost a heap though cried Nat feeling
that his friend was beginning to be appreciated

Of course it will but we are all going to give something I headed the
paper with my five dollars for if it is done at all it must be done
handsome

What all of it I never did see such a generous chap as you are and
Nat beamed upon him with sincere admiration

Well you see Ive been so bothered with my property that Im tired
of it and dont mean to save up any more but give it away as I go
along and then nobody will envy me or want to steal it and I shant
be suspecting folks and worrying about my old cash replied Tommy on
whom the cares and anxieties of a millionaire weighed heavily

Will Mr Bhaer let you do it

He thought it was a firstrate plan and said that some of the best men
he knew preferred to do good with their money instead of laying it up to
be squabbled over when they died

Your father is rich does he do that way

Im not sure he gives me all I want I know that much Im going to
talk to him about it when I go home Anyhow I shall set him a good
example and Tommy was so serious that Nat did not dare to laugh but
said respectfully

You will be able to do ever so much with your money wont you

So Mr Bhaer said and he promised to advise me about useful ways of
spending it Im going to begin with Dan and next time I get a dollar
or so I shall do something for Dick hes such a good little chap and
only has a cent a week for pocketmoney He cant earn much you know
so Im going to kind of see to him and goodhearted Tommy quite longed
to begin

I think thats a beautiful plan and Im not going to try to buy a
fiddle any more Im going to get Dan his net all myself and if there
is any money left Ill do something to please poor Billy Hes fond
of me and though he isnt poor hed like some little thing from me
because I can make out what he wants better than the rest of you
And Nat fell to wondering how much happiness could be got out of his
precious three dollars

So I would Now come and ask Mr Bhaer if you cant go in town with me
on Monday afternoon so you can get the net while I get the microscope
Franz and Emil are going too and well have a jolly time larking round
among the shops

The lads walked away arminarm discussing the new plans with droll
importance yet beginning already to feel the sweet satisfaction which
comes to those who try no matter how humbly to be earthly providences
to the poor and helpless and gild their mite with the gold of charity
before it is laid up where thieves cannot break through and steal

Come up and rest while we sort the leaves its so cool and pleasant
here said Demi as he and Dan came sauntering home from a long walk in
the woods

All right answered Dan who was a boy of few words and up they went

What makes birch leaves shake so much more than the others asked
inquiring Demi who was always sure of an answer from Dan

They are hung differently Dont you see the stem where it joins the
leaf is sort of pinched one way and where it joins the twig it is
pinched another This makes it waggle with the least bit of wind but
the elm leaves hang straight and keep stiller

How curious will this do so and Demi held up a sprig of acacia
which he had broken from a little tree on the lawn because it was so
pretty

No that belongs to the sort that shuts up when you touch it Draw your
finger down the middle of the stem and see if the leaves dont curl
up said Dan who was examining a bit of mica

Demi tried it and presently the little leaves did fold together till
the spray showed a single instead of a double line of leaves

I like that tell me about the others What do these do asked Demi
taking up a new branch

Feed silkworms they live on mulberry leaves till they begin to spin
themselves up I was in a silkfactory once and there were rooms full
of shelves all covered with leaves and worms eating them so fast that
it made a rustle Sometimes they eat so much they die Tell that to
Stuffy and Dan laughed as he took up another bit of rock with a
lichen on it

I know one thing about this mullein leaf the fairies use them for
blankets said Demi who had not quite given up his faith in the
existence of the little folk in green

If I had a microscope Id show you something prettier than fairies
said Dan wondering if he should ever own that coveted treasure I knew
an old woman who used mullein leaves for a nightcap because she had
faceache She sewed them together and wore it all the time

How funny was she your grandmother

Never had any She was a queer old woman and lived alone in a little
tumbledown house with nineteen cats Folks called her a witch but she
wasnt though she looked like an old ragbag She was real kind to me
when I lived in that place and used to let me get warm at her fire when
the folks at the poorhouse were hard on me

Did you live in a poorhouse

A little while Never mind that I didnt mean to speak of it and Dan
stopped short in his unusual fit of communicativeness

Tell about the cats please said Demi feeling that he had asked an
unpleasant question and sorry for it

Nothing to tell only she had a lot of em and kept em in a barrel
nights and I used to go and tip over the barrel sometimes and let em
out all over the house and then shed scold and chase em and put em
in again spitting and yowling like fury

Was she good to them asked Demi with a hearty childs laugh
pleasant to hear

Guess she was Poor old soul she took in all the lost and sick cats in
the town and when anybody wanted one they went to Marm Webber and she
let em pick any kind and color they wanted and only asked ninepence
she was glad to have her pussies get a good home

I should like to see Marm Webber Could I if I went to that place

Shes dead All my folks are said Dan briefly

Im sorry and Demi sat silent a minute wondering what subject would
be safe to try next He felt delicate about speaking of the departed
lady but was very curious about the cats and could not resist asking
softly

Did she cure the sick ones

Sometimes One had a broken leg and she tied it up to a stick and it
got well and another had fits and she doctored it with yarbs till
it was cured But some of em died and she buried em and when they
couldnt get well she killed em easy

How asked Demi feeling that there was a peculiar charm about this
old woman and some sort of joke about the cats because Dan was smiling
to himself

A kind lady who was fond of cats told her how and gave her some
stuff and sent all her own pussies to be killed that way Marm used
to put a sponge wet with ether in the bottom of an old boot then poke
puss in head downwards The ether put her to sleep in a jiffy and she
was drowned in warm water before she woke up

I hope the cats didnt feel it I shall tell Daisy about that You have
known a great many interesting things havent you asked Demi and
fell to meditating on the vast experience of a boy who had run away more
than once and taken care of himself in a big city

Wish I hadnt sometimes

Why Dont remembering them feel good

No

Its very singular how hard it is to manage your mind said Demi
clasping his hands round his knees and looking up at the sky as if for
information upon his favorite topic

Devilish hard no I dont mean that and Dan bit his lips for the
forbidden word slipped out in spite of him and he wanted to be more
careful with Demi than with any of the other boys

Ill play I didnt hear it said Demi and you wont do it again Im
sure

Not if I can help it Thats one of the things I dont want to
remember I keep pegging away but it dont seem to do much good and
Dan looked discouraged

Yes it does You dont say half so many bad words as you used to and
Aunt Jo is pleased because she said it was a hard habit to break up

Did she and Dan cheered up a bit

You must put swearing away in your faultdrawer and lock it up thats
the way I do with my badness

What do you mean asked Dan looking as if he found Demi almost as
amusing as a new sort of cockchafer or beetle

Well its one of my private plays and Ill tell you but I think
youll laugh at it began Demi glad to hold forth on this congenial
subject I play that my mind is a round room and my soul is a little
sort of creature with wings that lives in it The walls are full of
shelves and drawers and in them I keep my thoughts and my goodness and
badness and all sorts of things The goods I keep where I can see
them and the bads I lock up tight but they get out and I have to
keep putting them in and squeezing them down they are so strong The
thoughts I play with when I am alone or in bed and I make up and do
what I like with them Every Sunday I put my room in order and talk
with the little spirit that lives there and tell him what to do He is
very bad sometimes and wont mind me and I have to scold him and take
him to Grandpa He always makes him behave and be sorry for his faults
because Grandpa likes this play and gives me nice things to put in the
drawers and tells me how to shut up the naughties Hadnt you better
try that way Its a very good one and Demi looked so earnest and full
of faith that Dan did not laugh at his quaint fancy but said soberly

I dont think there is a lock strong enough to keep my badness shut up
Any way my room is in such a clutter I dont know how to clear it up

You keep your drawers in the cabinet all spandy nice why cant you do
the others

I aint used to it Will you show me how and Dan looked as if
inclined to try Demis childish way of keeping a soul in order

Id love to but I dont know how except to talk as Grandpa does I
cant do it good like him but Ill try

Dont tell any one only now and then well come here and talk things
over and Ill pay you for it by telling all I know about my sort of
things Will that do and Dan held out his big rough hand

Demi gave his smooth little hand readily and the league was made
for in the happy peaceful world where the younger boy lived lions
and lambs played together and little children innocently taught their
elders

Hush said Dan pointing toward the house as Demi was about to
indulge in another discourse on the best way of getting badness down
and keeping it down and peeping from their perch they saw Mrs Jo
strolling slowly along reading as she went while Teddy trotted behind
her dragging a little cart upside down

Wait till they see us whispered Demi and both sat still as the pair
came nearer Mrs Jo so absorbed in her book that she would have walked
into the brook if Teddy had not stopped her by saying

Marmar I wanter fis

Mrs Jo put down the charming book which she had been trying to read for
a week and looked about her for a fishingpole being used to making
toys out of nothing Before she had broken one from the hedge a
slender willow bough fell at her feet and looking up she saw the boys
laughing in the nest

Up up cried Teddy stretching his arms and flapping his skirts as if
about to fly

Ill come down and you come up I must go to Daisy now and Demi
departed to rehearse the tale of the nineteen cats with the exciting
bootandbarrel episodes

Teddy was speedily whisked up and then Dan said laughing Come too
theres plenty of room Ill lend you a hand

Mrs Jo glanced over her shoulder but no one was in sight and rather
liking the joke of the thing she laughed back saying Well if you
wont mention it I think I will and with two nimble steps was in the
willow

I havent climbed a tree since I was married I used to be very fond
of it when I was a girl she said looking wellpleased with her shady
perch

Now you read if you want to and Ill take care of Teddy proposed
Dan beginning to make a fishingrod for impatient Baby

I dont think I care about it now What were you and Demi at up here
asked Mrs Jo thinking from the sober look on Dans face that he had
something on his mind

Oh we were talking Id been telling him about leaves and things and
he was telling me some of his queer plays Now then Major fish away
and Dan finished off his work by putting a big blue fly on the bent pin
which hung at the end of the cord he had tied to the willowrod

Teddy leaned down from the tree and was soon wrapt up in watching
for the fish which he felt sure would come Dan held him by his little
petticoats lest he should take a header into the brook and Mrs Jo
soon won him to talk by doing so herself

I am so glad you told Demi about leaves and things it is just what
he needs and I wish you would teach him and take him to walk with
you

Id like to he is so bright but

But what

I didnt think youd trust me

Why not

Well Demi is so kind of precious and so good and Im such a bad lot
I thought youd keep him away from me

But you are not a bad lot as you say and I do trust you Dan
entirely because you honestly try to improve and do better and better
every week

Really and Dan looked up at her with the cloud of despondency lifting
from his face

Yes dont you feel it

I hoped so but I didnt know

I have been waiting and watching quietly for I thought Id give you a
good trial first and if you stood it I would give you the best reward
I had You have stood it well and now Im going to trust not only Demi
but my own boy to you because you can teach them some things better
than any of us

Can I and Dan looked amazed at the idea

Demi has lived among older people so much that he needs just what you
have knowledge of common things strength and courage He thinks you
are the bravest boy he ever saw and admires your strong way of doing
things Then you know a great deal about natural objects and can tell
him more wonderful tales of birds and bees and leaves and animals
than his storybooks give him and being true these stories will teach
and do him good Dont you see now how much you can help him and why I
like to have him with you

But I swear sometimes and might tell him something wrong I wouldnt
mean to but it might slip out just as devil did a few minutes ago
said Dan anxious to do his duty and let her know his shortcomings

I know you try not to say or do any thing to harm the little fellow
and here is where I think Demi will help you because he is so innocent
and wise in his small way and has what I am trying to give you dear
good principles It is never too early to try and plant them in a child
and never too late to cultivate them in the most neglected person You
are only boys yet you can teach one another Demi will unconsciously
strengthen your moral sense you will strengthen his common sense and I
shall feel as if I had helped you both

Words could not express how pleased and touched Dan was by this
confidence and praise No one had ever trusted him before no one had
cared to find out and foster the good in him and no one had suspected
how much there was hidden away in the breast of the neglected boy going
fast to ruin yet quick to feel and value sympathy and help No honor
that he might earn hereafter would ever be half so precious as the right
to teach his few virtues and small store of learning to the child
whom he most respected and no more powerful restraint could have been
imposed upon him than the innocent companion confided to his care He
found courage now to tell Mrs Jo of the plan already made with Demi
and she was glad that the first step had been so naturally taken Every
thing seemed to be working well for Dan and she rejoiced over him
because it had seemed a hard task yet working on with a firm belief in
the possibility of reformation in far older and worse subjects than he
there had come this quick and hopeful change to encourage her He felt
that he had friends now and a place in the world something to live and
work for and though he said little all that was best and bravest in a
character made old by a hard experience responded to the love and faith
bestowed on him and Dans salvation was assured

Their quiet talk was interrupted by a shout of delight from Teddy who
to the surprise of every one did actually catch a trout where no trout
had been seen for years He was so enchanted with his splendid success
that he insisted on showing his prize to the family before Asia cooked
it for supper so the three descended and went happily away together
all satisfied with the work of that half hour

Ned was the next visitor to the tree but he only made a short stay
sitting there at his ease while Dick and Dolly caught a pailful of
grasshoppers and crickets for him He wanted to play a joke on Tommy
and intended to tuck up a few dozen of the lively creatures in his bed
so that when Bangs got in he would speedily tumble out again and pass
a portion of the night in chasing hoppergrasses round the room The
hunt was soon over and having paid the hunters with a few peppermints
apiece Ned retired to make Tommys bed

For an hour the old willow sighed and sung to itself talked with the
brook and watched the lengthening shadows as the sun went down The
first rosy color was touching its graceful branches when a boy came
stealing up the avenue across the lawn and spying Billy by the
brookside went to him saying in a mysterious tone

Go and tell Mr Bhaer I want to see him down here please Dont let
any one hear

Billy nodded and ran off while the boy swung himself up into the tree
and sat there looking anxious yet evidently feeling the charm of the
place and hour In five minutes Mr Bhaer appeared and stepping up on
the fence leaned into the nest saying kindly

I am glad to see you Jack but why not come in and meet us all at
once

I wanted to see you first please sir Uncle made me come back I know
I dont deserve any thing but I hope the fellows wont be hard upon
me

Poor Jack did not get on very well but it was evident that he was sorry
and ashamed and wanted to be received as easily as possible for his
Uncle had thrashed him well and scolded him soundly for following the
example he himself set Jack had begged not to be sent back but the
school was cheap and Mr Ford insisted so the boy returned as quietly
as possible and took refuge behind Mr Bhaer

I hope not but I cant answer for them though I will see that they
are not unjust I think as Dan and Nat have suffered so much being
innocent you should suffer something being guilty Dont you asked
Mr Bhaer pitying Jack yet feeling he deserved punishment for a fault
which had so little excuse

I suppose so but I sent Tommys money back and I said I was sorry
isnt that enough said Jack rather sullenly for the boy who could do
so mean a thing was not brave enough to bear the consequences well

No I think you should ask pardon of all three boys openly and
honestly You cannot expect them to respect and trust you for a time
but you can live down this disgrace if you try and I will help you
Stealing and lying are detestable sins and I hope this will be a lesson
to you I am glad you are ashamed it is a good sign bear it patiently
and do your best to earn a better reputation

Ill have an auction and sell off all my goods dirt cheap said Jack
showing his repentance in the most characteristic way

I think it would be better to give them away and begin on a new
foundation Take Honesty is the best policy for your motto and live
up to it in act and word and thought and though you dont make a cent
of money this summer you will be a rich boy in the autumn said Mr
Bhaer earnestly

It was hard but Jack consented for he really felt that cheating didnt
pay and wanted to win back the friendship of the boys His heart clung
to his possessions and he groaned inwardly at the thought of actually
giving away certain precious things Asking pardon publicly was easy
compared to this but then he began to discover that certain other
things invisible but most valuable were better property than knives
fishhooks or even money itself So he decided to buy up a little
integrity even at a high price and secure the respect of his
playmates though it was not a salable article

Well Ill do it he said with a sudden air of resolution which
pleased Mr Bhaer

Good and Ill stand by you Now come and begin at once

And Father Bhaer led the bankrupt boy back into the little world which
received him coldly at first but slowly warmed to him when he showed
that he had profited by the lesson and was sincerely anxious to go into
a better business with a new stockintrade



CHAPTER XVI TAMING THE COLT

What in the world is that boy doing said Mrs Jo to herself as she
watched Dan running round the halfmile triangle as if for a wager
He was all alone and seemed possessed by some strange desire to run
himself into a fever or break his neck for after several rounds he
tried leaping walls and turning somersaults up the avenue and finally
dropped down on the grass before the door as if exhausted

Are you training for a race Dan asked Mrs Jo from the window where
she sat

He looked up quickly and stopped panting to answer with a laugh

No Im only working off my steam

Cant you find a cooler way of doing it You will be ill if you tear
about so in such warm weather said Mrs Jo laughing also as she
threw him out a great palmleaf fan

Cant help it I must run somewhere answered Dan with such an odd
expression in his restless eyes that Mrs Jo was troubled and asked
quickly

Is Plumfield getting too narrow for you

I wouldnt mind if it was a little bigger I like it though only the
fact is the devil gets into me sometimes and then I do want to bolt

The words seemed to come against his will for he looked sorry the
minute they were spoken and seemed to think he deserved a reproof for
his ingratitude But Mrs Jo understood the feeling and though sorry to
see it she could not blame the boy for confessing it She looked at him
anxiously seeing how tall and strong he had grown how full of energy
his face was with its eager eyes and resolute mouth and remembering
the utter freedom he had known for years before she felt how even the
gentle restraint of this home would weigh upon him at times when the old
lawless spirit stirred in him Yes she said to herself my wild hawk
needs a larger cage and yet if I let him go I am afraid he will be
lost I must try and find some lure strong enough to keep him safe

I know all about it she added aloud It is not the devil as you
call it but the very natural desire of all young people for liberty I
used to feel just so and once I really did think for a minute that I
would bolt

Why didnt you said Dan coming to lean on the low windowledge with
an evident desire to continue the subject

I knew it was foolish and love for my mother kept me at home

I havent got any mother began Dan

I thought you had now said Mrs Jo gently stroking the rough hair
off his hot forehead

You are no end good to me and I cant ever thank you enough but it
just isnt the same is it and Dan looked up at her with a wistful
hungry look that went to her heart

No dear it is not the same and never can be I think an own mother
would have been a great deal to you But as that cannot be you must
try to let me fill her place I fear I have not done all I ought or you
would not want to leave me she added sorrowfully

Yes you have cried Dan eagerly I dont want to go and I wont
go if I can help it but every now and then I feel as if I must burst
out somehow I want to run straight ahead somewhere to smash something
or pitch into somebody Dont know why but I do and thats all about
it

Dan laughed as he spoke but he meant what he said for he knit his
black brows and brought down his fist on the ledge with such force
that Mrs Jos thimble flew off into the grass He brought it back and
as she took it she held the big brown hand a minute saying with a
look that showed the words cost her something

Well Dan run if you must but dont run very far and come back to me
soon for I want you very much

He was rather taken aback by this unexpected permission to play truant
and somehow it seemed to lessen his desire to go He did not understand
why but Mrs Jo did and knowing the natural perversity of the human
mind counted on it to help her now She felt instinctively that the
more the boy was restrained the more he would fret against it but leave
him free and the mere sense of liberty would content him joined to the
knowledge that his presence was dear to those whom he loved best It was
a little experiment but it succeeded for Dan stood silent a moment
unconsciously picking the fan to pieces and turning the matter over
in his mind He felt that she appealed to his heart and his honor
and owned that he understood it by saying presently with a mixture of
regret and resolution in his face

I wont go yet awhile and Ill give you fair warning before I bolt
Thats fair isnt it

Yes we will let it stand so Now I want to see if I cant find some
way for you to work off your steam better than running about the place
like a mad dog spoiling my fans or fighting with the boys What can we
invent and while Dan tried to repair the mischief he had done Mrs
Jo racked her brain for some new device to keep her truant safe until he
had learned to love his lessons better

How would you like to be my expressman she said as a sudden thought
popped into her head

Go into town and do the errands asked Dan looking interested at
once

Yes Franz is tired of it Silas cannot be spared just now and Mr
Bhaer has no time Old Andy is a safe horse you are a good driver and
know your way about the city as well as a postman Suppose you try it
and see if it wont do most as well to drive away two or three times a
week as to run away once a month

Id like it ever so much only I must go alone and do it all myself I
dont want any of the other fellows bothering round said Dan taking
to the new idea so kindly that he began to put on business airs already

If Mr Bhaer does not object you shall have it all your own way I
suppose Emil will growl but he cannot be trusted with horses and you
can By the way tomorrow is marketday and I must make out my list
You had better see that the wagon is in order and tell Silas to have
the fruit and vegetables ready for mother You will have to be up early
and get back in time for school can you do that

Im always an early bird so I dont mind and Dan slung on his jacket
with despatch

The early bird got the worm this time Im sure said Mrs Jo
merrily

And a jolly good worm it is answered Dan as he went laughing away to
put a new lash to the whip wash the wagon and order Silas about with
all the importance of a young expressman

Before he is tired of this I will find something else and have it ready
when the next restless fit comes on said Mrs Jo to herself as she
wrote her list with a deep sense of gratitude that all her boys were not
Dans

Mr Bhaer did not entirely approve of the new plan but agreed to give
it a trial which put Dan on his mettle and caused him to give up
certain wild plans of his own in which the new lash and the long
hill were to have borne a part He was up and away very early the next
morning heroically resisting the temptation to race with the milkmen
going into town Once there he did his errands carefully to Mr
Bhaers surprise and Mrs Jos great satisfaction The Commodore did
growl at Dans promotion but was pacified by a superior padlock to his
new boathouse and the thought that seamen were meant for higher honors
than driving marketwagons and doing family errands So Dan filled
his new office well and contentedly for weeks and said no more about
bolting But one day Mr Bhaer found him pummelling Jack who was
roaring for mercy under his knee

Why Dan I thought you had given up fighting he said as he went to
the rescue

We aint fighting we are only wrestling answered Dan leaving off
reluctantly

It looks very much like it and feels like it hey Jack said Mr
Bhaer as the defeated gentleman got upon his legs with difficulty

Catch me wrestling with him again Hes most knocked my head off
snarled Jack holding on to that portion of his frame as if it really
was loose upon his shoulders

The fact is we began in fun but when I got him down I couldnt help
pounding him Sorry I hurt you old fellow explained Dan looking
rather ashamed of himself

I understand The longing to pitch into somebody was so strong you
couldnt resist You are a sort of Berserker Dan and something to
tussle with is as necessary to you as music is to Nat said Mr Bhaer
who knew all about the conversation between the boy and Mrs Jo

Cant help it So if you dont want to be pounded youd better keep out
of the way answered Dan with a warning look in his black eyes that
made Jack sheer off in haste

If you want something to wrestle with I will give you a tougher
specimen than Jack said Mr Bhaer and leading the way to the
woodyard he pointed out certain roots of trees that had been grubbed
up in the spring and had been lying there waiting to be split

There when you feel inclined to maltreat the boys just come and work
off your energies here and Ill thank you for it

So I will and seizing the axe that lay near Dan hauled out a tough
root and went at it so vigorously that the chips flew far and wide
and Mr Bhaer fled for his life

To his great amusement Dan took him at his word and was often seen
wrestling with the ungainly knots hat and jacket off red face and
wrathful eyes for he got into royal rages over some of his adversaries
and swore at them under his breath till he had conquered them when he
exulted and marched off to the shed with an armful of gnarled oakwood
in triumph He blistered his hands tired his back and dulled the axe
but it did him good and he got more comfort out of the ugly roots than
any one dreamed for with each blow he worked off some of the pentup
power that would otherwise have been expended in some less harmless way

When this is gone I really dont know what I shall do said Mrs Jo
to herself for no inspiration came and she was at the end of her
resources

But Dan found a new occupation for himself and enjoyed it some time
before any one discovered the cause of his contentment A fine young
horse of Mr Lauries was kept at Plumfield that summer running loose
in a large pasture across the brook The boys were all interested in the
handsome spirited creature and for a time were fond of watching him
gallop and frisk with his plumey tail flying and his handsome head
in the air But they soon got tired of it and left Prince Charlie to
himself All but Dan he never tired of looking at the horse and seldom
failed to visit him each day with a lump of sugar a bit of bread or
an apple to make him welcome Charlie was grateful accepted his
friendship and the two loved one another as if they felt some tie
between them inexplicable but strong In whatever part of the wide
field he might be Charlie always came at full speed when Dan whistled
at the bars and the boy was never happier than when the beautiful
fleet creature put its head on his shoulder looking up at him with fine
eyes full of intelligent affection

We understand one another without any palaver dont we old fellow
Dan would say proud of the horses confidence and so jealous of his
regard that he told no one how well the friendship prospered and never
asked anybody but Teddy to accompany him on these daily visits

Mr Laurie came now and then to see how Charlie got on and spoke of
having him broken to harness in the autumn

He wont need much taming he is such a gentle finetempered brute I
shall come out and try him with a saddle myself some day he said on
one of these visits

He lets me put a halter on him but I dont believe he will bear a
saddle even if you put it on answered Dan who never failed to be
present when Charlie and his master met

I shall coax him to bear it and not mind a few tumbles at first He
has never been harshly treated so though he will be surprised at the
new performance I think he wont be frightened and his antics will do
no harm

I wonder what he would do said Dan to himself as Mr Laurie went
away with the Professor and Charlie returned to the bars from which he
had retired when the gentlemen came up

A daring fancy to try the experiment took possession of the boy as he
sat on the topmost rail with the glossy back temptingly near him
Never thinking of danger he obeyed the impulse and while Charlie
unsuspectingly nibbled at the apple he held Dan quickly and quietly
took his seat He did not keep it long however for with an astonished
snort Charlie reared straight up and deposited Dan on the ground The
fall did not hurt him for the turf was soft and he jumped up saying
with a laugh

I did it anyway Come here you rascal and Ill try it again

But Charlie declined to approach and Dan left him resolving to succeed
in the end for a struggle like this suited him exactly Next time he
took a halter and having got it on he played with the horse for a
while leading him to and fro and putting him through various antics
till he was a little tired then Dan sat on the wall and gave him bread
but watched his chance and getting a good grip of the halter slipped
on to his back Charlie tried the old trick but Dan held on having had
practice with Toby who occasionally had an obstinate fit and tried to
shake off his rider Charlie was both amazed and indignant and after
prancing for a minute set off at a gallop and away went Dan heels over
head If he had not belonged to the class of boys who go through all
sorts of dangers unscathed he would have broken his neck as it was he
got a heavy fall and lay still collecting his wits while Charlie tore
round the field tossing his head with every sign of satisfaction at
the discomfiture of his rider Presently it seemed to occur to him that
something was wrong with Dan and being of a magnanimous nature he
went to see what the matter was Dan let him sniff about and perplex
himself for a few minutes then he looked up at him saying as
decidedly as if the horse could understand

You think you have beaten but you are mistaken old boy and Ill ride
you yet see if I dont

He tried no more that day but soon after attempted a new method of
introducing Charlie to a burden He strapped a folded blanket on his
back and then let him race and rear and roll and fume as much as
he liked After a few fits of rebellion Charlie submitted and in a few
days permitted Dan to mount him often stopped short to look round as
if he said half patiently half reproachfully I dont understand it
but I suppose you mean no harm so I permit the liberty

Dan patted and praised him and took a short turn every day getting
frequent falls but persisting in spite of them and longing to try a
saddle and bridle but not daring to confess what he had done He had
his wish however for there had been a witness of his pranks who said a
good word for him

Do you know what that chap has ben doin lately asked Silas of his
master one evening as he received his orders for the next day

Which boy said Mr Bhaer with an air of resignation expecting some
sad revelation

Dan hes ben a breaking the colt sir and I wish I may die if he
aint done it answered Silas chuckling

How do you know

Wal I kinder keep an eye on the little fellers and most genlly know
what theyre up to so when Dan kep going off to the paster and coming
home black and blue I mistrusted that suthing was goin on I didnt
say nothin but I crep up into the barn chamber and from there I see
him goin through all manner of games with Charlie Blest if he warnt
throwed time and agin and knocked round like a bag o meal But the
pluck of that boy did beat all and he peared to like it and kep on as
ef bound to beat

But Silas you should have stopped it the boy might have been killed
said Mr Bhaer wondering what freak his irrepressibles would take into
their heads next

Spose I oughter but there warnt no real danger for Charlie aint
no tricks and is as pretty a tempered horse as ever I see Fact was I
couldnt bear to spile sport for ef theres any thing I do admire its
grit and Dan is chock full on t But now I know hes hankerin after
a saddle and yet wont take even the old one on the sly so I just
thought Id up and tell and may be youd let him try what he can do
Mr Laurie wont mind and Charlies all the better for t

We shall see and off went Mr Bhaer to inquire into the matter

Dan owned up at once and proudly proved that Silas was right by showing
off his power over Charlie for by dint of much coaxing many carrots
and infinite perseverance he really had succeeded in riding the colt
with a halter and blanket Mr Laurie was much amused and well pleased
with Dans courage and skill and let him have a hand in all future
performances for he set about Charlies education at once saying
that he was not going to be outdone by a slip of a boy Thanks to Dan
Charlie took kindly to the saddle and bridle when he had once reconciled
himself to the indignity of the bit and after Mr Laurie had trained
him a little Dan was permitted to ride him to the great envy and
admiration of the other boys

Isnt he handsome and dont he mind me like a lamb said Dan one day
as he dismounted and stood with his arm round Charlies neck

Yes and isnt he a much more useful and agreeable animal than the
wild colt who spent his days racing about the field jumping fences and
running away now and then asked Mrs Bhaer from the steps where she
always appeared when Dan performed with Charlie

Of course he is See he wont run away now even if I dont hold him
and he comes to me the minute I whistle I have tamed him well havent
I and Dan looked both proud and pleased as well he might for in
spite of their struggles together Charlie loved him better than his
master

I am taming a colt too and I think I shall succeed as well as you if
I am as patient and persevering said Mrs Jo smiling so significantly
at him that Dan understood and answered laughing yet in earnest

We wont jump over the fence and run away but stay and let them make a
handsome useful span of us hey Charlie



CHAPTER XVII COMPOSITION DAY

Hurry up boys its three oclock and Uncle Fritz likes us to be
punctual you know said Franz one Wednesday afternoon as a bell rang
and a stream of literarylooking young gentlemen with books and paper in
their hands were seen going toward the museum

Tommy was in the schoolroom bending over his desk much bedaubed with
ink flushed with the ardor of inspiration and in a great hurry as
usual for easygoing Bangs never was ready till the very last minute
As Franz passed the door looking up laggards Tommy gave one last blot
and flourish and departed out the window waving his paper to dry as
he went Nan followed looking very important with a large roll in her
hand and Demi escorted Daisy both evidently brimful of some delightful
secret

The museum was all in order and the sunshine among the hopvines made
pretty shadows on the floor as it peeped through the great window On
one side sat Mr and Mrs Bhaer on the other was a little table
on which the compositions were laid as soon as read and in a large
semicircle sat the children on campstools which occasionally shut up
and let the sitter down thus preventing any stiffness in the assembly
As it took too much time to have all read they took turns and on this
Wednesday the younger pupils were the chief performers while the elder
ones listened with condescension and criticised freely

Ladies first so Nan may begin said Mr Bhaer when the settling of
stools and rustling of papers had subsided

Nan took her place beside the little table and with a preliminary
giggle read the following interesting essay on

THE SPONGE

The sponge my friends is a most useful and interesting plant It
grows on rocks under the water and is a kind of seaweed I believe
People go and pick it and dry it and wash it because little fish and
insects live in the holes of the sponge I found shells in my new one
and sand Some are very fine and soft babies are washed with them The
sponge has many uses I will relate some of them and I hope my friends
will remember what I say One use is to wash the face I dont like it
myself but I do it because I wish to be clean Some people dont and
they are dirty Here the eye of the reader rested sternly upon Dick and
Dolly who quailed under it and instantly resolved to scrub themselves
virtuously on all occasions Another use is to wake people up I allude
to boys particularly Another pause after the long word to enjoy
the smothered laugh that went round the room Some boys do not get
up when called and Mary Ann squeezes the water out of a wet sponge
on their faces and it makes them so mad they wake up Here the laugh
broke out and Emil said as if he had been hit

Seems to me you are wandering from the subject

No I aint we are to write about vegetables or animals and Im doing
both for boys are animals arent they cried Nan and undaunted by
the indignant No shouted at her she calmly proceeded

One more interesting thing is done with sponges and this is when
doctors put ether on it and hold it to peoples noses when they have
teeth out I shall do this when I am bigger and give ether to the sick
so they will go to sleep and not feel me cut off their legs and arms

I know somebody who killed cats with it called out Demi but was
promptly crushed by Dan who upset his campstool and put a hat over his
face

I will not be interruckted said Nan frowning upon the unseemly
scrimmagers Order was instantly restored and the young lady closed her
remarks as follows

My composition has three morals my friends Somebody groaned but no
notice was taken of the insult First is keep your faces clean second
get up early third when the ether sponge is put over your nose breathe
hard and dont kick and your teeth will come out easy I have no more
to say And Miss Nan sat down amid tumultuous applause

That is a very remarkable composition its tone is high and there is
a good deal of humor in it Very well done Nan Now Daisy and Mr
Bhaer smiled at one young lady as he beckoned the other

Daisy colored prettily as she took her place and said in her modest
little voice

Im afraid you wont like mine it isnt nice and funny like Nans But
I couldnt do any better

We always like yours Posy said Uncle Fritz and a gentle murmur from
the boys seemed to confirm the remark Thus encouraged Daisy read her
little paper which was listened to with respectful attention

THE CAT

The cat is a sweet animal I love them very much They are clean and
pretty and catch rats and mice and let you pet them and are fond
of you if you are kind They are very wise and can find their way
anywhere Little cats are called kittens and are dear things I have
two named Huz and Buz and their mother is Topaz because she has
yellow eyes Uncle told me a pretty story about a man named Mahomet
He had a nice cat and when she was asleep on his sleeve and he wanted
to go away he cut off the sleeve so as not to wake her up I think he
was a kind man Some cats catch fish

So do I cried Teddy jumping up eager to tell about his trout

Hush said his mother setting him down again as quickly as possible
for orderly Daisy hated to be interruckted as Nan expressed it

I read about one who used to do it very slyly I tried to make Topaz
but she did not like the water and scratched me She does like tea and
when I play in my kitchen she pats the teapot with her paw till I give
her some She is a fine cat she eats applepudding and molasses Most
cats do not

Thats a firstrater called out Nat and Daisy retired pleased with
the praise of her friend

Demi looks so impatient we must have him up at once or he wont hold
out said Uncle Fritz and Demi skipped up with alacrity

Mine is a poem he announced in a tone of triumph and read his first
effort in a loud and solemn voice

 I write about the butterfly
 It is a pretty thing
 And flies about like the birds
 But it does not sing
 First it is a little grub
 And then it is a nice yellow cocoon
 And then the butterfly
 Eats its way out soon
 They live on dew and honey
 They do not have any hive
 They do not sting like wasps and bees and hornets
 And to be as good as they are we should strive
 I should like to be a beautiful butterfly
 All yellow and blue and green and red
 But I should not like
 To have Dan put camphor on my poor little head

This unusual burst of genius brought down the house and Demi was
obliged to read it again a somewhat difficult task as there was no
punctuation whatever and the little poets breath gave out before he
got to the end of some of the long lines

He will be a Shakespeare yet said Aunt Jo laughing as if she would
die for this poetic gem reminded her of one of her own written at the
age of ten and beginning gloomily

 I wish I had a quiet tomb
 Beside a little rill
 Where birds and bees and butterflies
 Would sing upon the hill

Come on Tommy If there is as much ink inside your paper as there is
outside it will be a long composition said Mr Bhaer when Demi had
been induced to tear himself from his poem and sit down

It isnt a composition its a letter You see I forgot all about its
being my turn till after school and then I didnt know what to have
and there wasnt time to read up so I thought you wouldnt mind my
taking a letter that I wrote to my Grandma Its got something about
birds in it so I thought it would do

With this long excuse Tommy plunged into a sea of ink and floundered
through pausing now and then to decipher one of his own flourishes

MY DEAR GRANDMA I hope you are well Uncle James sent me a pocket
rifle It is a beautiful little instrument of killing shaped like
this Here Tommy displayed a remarkable sketch of what looked like
an intricate pump or the inside of a small steamengine 44 are the
sights 6 is a false stock that fits in at A 3 is the trigger and 2
is the cock It loads at the breech and fires with great force and
straightness I am going out shooting squirrels soon I shot several
fine birds for the museum They had speckled breasts and Dan liked
them very much He stuffed them tiptop and they sit on the tree quite
natural only one looks a little tipsy We had a Frenchman working here
the other day and Asia called his name so funnily that I will tell
you about it His name was Germain first she called him Jerry but we
laughed at her and she changed it to Jeremiah but ridicule was
the result so it became Mr Germany but ridicule having been again
resumed it became Garrymon which it has remained ever since I do not
write often I am so busy but I think of you often and sympathize with
you and sincerely hope you get on as well as can be expected without
me Your affectionate grandson

THOMAS BUCKMINSTER BANGS

PS If you come across any postagestamps remember me

NB Love to all and a great deal to Aunt Almira Does she make any
nice plumcakes now

PS Mrs Bhaer sends her respects

PS And so would Mr B if he knew I was in act to write

NB Father is going to give me a watch on my birthday I am glad as at
present I have no means of telling time and am often late at school

PS I hope to see you soon Dont you wish to send for me

T B B


As each postscript was received with a fresh laugh from the boys by the
time he came to the sixth and last Tommy was so exhausted that he was
glad to sit down and wipe his ruddy face

I hope the dear old lady will live through it said Mr Bhaer under
cover of the noise

We wont take any notice of the broad hint given in that last PS
The letter will be quite as much as she can bear without a visit from
Tommy answered Mrs Jo remembering that the old lady usually took to
her bed after a visitation from her irrepressible grandson

Now me said Teddy who had learned a bit of poetry and was so eager
to say it that he had been bobbing up and down during the reading and
could no longer be restrained

Im afraid he will forget it if he waits and I have had a deal of
trouble teaching him said his mother

Teddy trotted to the rostrum dropped a curtsey and nodded his head at
the same time as if anxious to suit every one then in his baby voice
and putting the emphasis on the wrong words he said his verse all in
one breath

 Little drops of water
 Little drains of sand
 Mate a might okum ocean
 And a peasant land
 Little words of kindness
 Pokin evvy day
 Make a home a hebbin
 And hep us on a way

Clapping his hands at the end he made another double salutation and
then ran to hide his head in his mothers lap quite overcome by the
success of his piece for the applause was tremendous

Dick and Dolly did not write but were encouraged to observe the habits
of animals and insects and report what they saw Dick liked this and
always had a great deal to say so when his name was called he marched
up and looking at the audience with his bright confiding eyes told
his little story so earnestly that no one smiled at his crooked body
because the straight soul shone through it beautifully

Ive been watching dragonflies and I read about them in Dans book
and Ill try and tell you what I remember Theres lots of them flying
round on the pond all blue with big eyes and sort of lace wings
very pretty I caught one and looked at him and I think he was the
handsomest insect I ever saw They catch littler creatures than they
are to eat and have a queer kind of hook thing that folds up when they
aint hunting It likes the sunshine and dances round all day Let me
see what else was there to tell about Oh I know The eggs are laid in
the water and go down to the bottom and are hatched in the mud Little
ugly things come out of em I cant say the name but they are brown
and keep having new skins and getting bigger and bigger Only think it
takes them two years to be a dragonfly Now this is the curiousest part
of it so you listen tight for I dont believe you know it When it is
ready it knows somehow and the ugly grubby thing climbs up out of the
water on a flag or a bulrush and bursts open its back

Come I dont believe that said Tommy who was not an observant boy
and really thought Dick was making up

It does burst open its back dont it and Dick appealed to Mr Bhaer
who nodded a very decided affirmative to the little speakers great
satisfaction

Well out comes the dragonfly all whole and he sits in the sun sort
of coming alive you know and he gets strong and then he spreads his
pretty wings and flies away up in the air and never is a grub any
more Thats all I know but I shall watch and try to see him do it for
I think its splendid to turn into a beautiful dragonfly dont you

Dick had told his story well and when he described the flight of the
newborn insect had waved his hands and looked up as if he saw and
wanted to follow it Something in his face suggested to the minds of
the elder listeners the thought that some day little Dick would have his
wish and after years of helplessness and pain would climb up into the
sun some happy day and leaving his poor little body behind him find
a new lovely shape in a fairer world than this Mrs Jo drew him to her
side and said with a kiss on his thin cheek

That is a sweet little story dear and you remembered it wonderfully
well I shall write and tell your mother all about it and Dick sat
on her knee contentedly smiling at the praise and resolving to watch
well and catch the dragonfly in the act of leaving its old body for
the new and see how he did it Dolly had a few remarks to make upon
the Duck and made them in a singsong tone for he had learned it by
heart and thought it a great plague to do it at all

Wild ducks are hard to kill men hide and shoot at them and have tame
ducks to quack and make the wild ones come where the men can fire at
them They have wooden ducks made too and they sail round and the
wild ones come to see them they are stupid I think Our ducks are very
tame They eat a great deal and go poking round in the mud and water
They dont take good care of their eggs but them spoil and

Mine dont cried Tommy

Well some peoples do Silas said so Hens take good care of little
ducks only they dont like to have them go in the water and make a
great fuss But the little ones dont care a bit I like to eat ducks
with stuffing in them and lots of applesauce

I have something to say about owls began Nat who had carefully
prepared a paper upon this subject with some help from Dan

Owls have big heads round eyes hooked bills and strong claws Some
are gray some white some black and yellowish Their feathers are very
soft and stick out a great deal They fly very quietly and hunt bats
mice little birds and such things They build nests in barns hollow
trees and some take the nests of other birds The great horned owl has
two eggs bigger than a hens and reddish brown The tawny owl has
five eggs white and smooth and this is the kind that hoots at night
Another kind sounds like a child crying They eat mice and bats whole
and the parts that they cannot digest they make into little balls and
spit out

My gracious how funny Nan was heard to observe

They cannot see by day and if they get out into the light they go
flapping round half blind and the other birds chase and peck at them
as if they were making fun The horned owl is very big most as big as
the eagle It eats rabbits rats snakes and birds and lives in rocks
and old tumbledown houses They have a good many cries and scream like
a person being choked and say Waugh O waugh O and it scares people
at night in the woods The white owl lives by the sea and in cold
places and looks something like a hawk There is a kind of owl that
makes holes to live in like moles It is called the burrowing owl and
is very small The barnowl is the commonest kind and I have watched
one sitting in a hole in a tree looking like a little gray cat with
one eye shut and the other open He comes out at dusk and sits round
waiting for the bats I caught one and here he is

With that Nat suddenly produced from inside his jacket a little downy
bird who blinked and ruffled his feathers looking very plump and
sleepy and scared

Dont touch him He is going to show off said Nat displaying his new
pet with great pride First he put a cocked hat on the birds head
and the boys laughed at the funny effect then he added a pair of paper
spectacles and that gave the owl such a wise look that they shouted
with merriment The performance closed with making the bird angry and
seeing him cling to a handkerchief upside down pecking and clucking
as Rob called it He was allowed to fly after that and settled himself
on the bunch of pinecones over the door where he sat staring down at
the company with an air of sleepy dignity that amused them very much

Have you anything for us George asked Mr Bhaer when the room was
still again

Well I read and learned ever so much about moles but I declare Ive
forgotten every bit of it except that they dig holes to live in that
you catch them by pouring water down and that they cant possibly live
without eating very often and Stuffy sat down wishing he had not been
too lazy to write out his valuable observations for a general smile
went round when he mentioned the last of the three facts which lingered
in his memory

Then we are done for today began Mr Bhaer but Tommy called out in
a great hurry

No we aint Dont you know We must give the thing and he winked
violently as he made an eyeglass of his fingers

Bless my heart I forgot Now is your time Tom and Mr Bhaer dropped
into his seat again while all the boys but Dan looked mightily tickled
at something

Nat Tommy and Demi left the room and speedily returned with a little
red morocco box set forth in state on Mrs Jos best silver salver
Tommy bore it and still escorted by Nat and Demi marched up to
unsuspecting Dan who stared at them as if he thought they were going to
make fun of him Tommy had prepared an elegant and impressive speech for
the occasion but when the minute came it all went out of his head and
he just said straight from his kindly boyish heart

Here old fellow we all wanted to give you something to kind of pay
for what happened awhile ago and to show how much we liked you for
being such a trump Please take it and have a jolly good time with it

Dan was so surprised he could only get as red as the little box and
mutter Thanky boys as he fumbled to open it But when he saw
what was inside his face lighted up and he seized the long desired
treasure saying so enthusiastically that every one was satisfied
though is language was anything but polished

What a stunner I say you fellows are regular bricks to give me this
its just what I wanted Give us your paw Tommy

Many paws were given and heartily shaken for the boys were charmed
with Dans pleasure and crowded round him to shake hands and expatiate
on the beauties of their gift In the midst of this pleasant chatter
Dans eye went to Mrs Jo who stood outside the group enjoying the
scene with all her heart

No I had nothing to do with it The boys got it up all themselves
she said answering the grateful look that seemed to thank her for
that happy moment Dan smiled and said in a tone that only she could
understand

Its you all the same and making his way through the boys he held
out his hand first to her and then to the good Professor who was
beaming benevolently on his flock

He thanked them both with the silent hearty squeeze he gave the kind
hands that had held him up and led him into the safe refuge of a happy
home Not a word was spoken but they felt all he would say and little
Teddy expressed his pleasure for them as he leaned from his fathers arm
to hug the boy and say in his baby way

My dood Danny everybody loves him now

Come here show off your spyglass Dan and let us see some of your
magnified pollywogs and annymalcumisms as you call em said Jack who
felt so uncomfortable during this scene that he would have slipped away
if Emil had not kept him

So I will take a squint at that and see what you think of it said
Dan glad to show off his precious microscope

He held it over a beetle that happened to be lying on the table and
Jack bent down to take his squint but looked up with an amazed face
saying

My eye what nippers the old thing has got I see now why it hurts so
confoundedly when you grab a dorbug and he grabs back again

He winked at me cried Nan who had poked her head under Jacks elbow
and got the second peep

Every one took a look and then Dan showed them the lovely plumage on a
moths wing the four feathery corners to a hair the veins on a leaf
hardly visible to the naked eye but like a thick net through the
wonderful little glass the skin on their own fingers looking like
queer hills and valleys a cobweb like a bit of coarse sewing silk and
the sting of a bee

Its like the fairy spectacles in my storybook only more curious
said Demi enchanted with the wonders he saw

Dan is a magician now and he can show you many miracles going on all
round you for he has two things needful patience and a love of nature
We live in a beautiful and wonderful world Demi and the more you know
about it the wiser and the better you will be This little glass will
give you a new set of teachers and you may learn fine lessons from them
if you will said Mr Bhaer glad to see how interested the boys were
in the matter

Could I see anybodys soul with this microscope if I looked hard
asked Demi who was much impressed with the power of the bit of glass

No dear its not powerful enough for that and never can be made so
You must wait a long while before your eyes are clear enough to see the
most invisible of Gods wonders But looking at the lovely things you
can see will help you to understand the lovelier things you can not
see answered Uncle Fritz with his hand on the boys head

Well Daisy and I both think that if there are any angels their wings
look like that butterflys as we see it through the glass only more
soft and gold

Believe it if you like and keep your own little wings as bright and
beautiful only dont fly away for a long time yet

No I wont and Demi kept his word

Goodby my boys I must go now but I leave you with our new Professor
of Natural History and Mrs Jo went away well pleased with that
composition day



CHAPTER XVIII CROPS

The gardens did well that summer and in September the little crops were
gathered in with much rejoicing Jack and Ned joined their farms and
raised potatoes those being a good salable article They got twelve
bushels counting little ones and all and sold them to Mr Bhaer at a
fair price for potatoes went fast in that house Emil and Franz devoted
themselves to corn and had a jolly little husking in the barn after
which they took their corn to the mill and came proudly home with meal
enough to supply the family with hastypudding and Johnnycake for a
lone time They would not take money for their crop because as Franz
said We never can pay Uncle for all he has done for us if we raised
corn for the rest of our days

Nat had beans in such abundance that he despaired of ever shelling them
till Mrs Jo proposed a new way which succeeded admirably The dry
pods were spread upon the barnfloor Nat fiddled and the boys danced
quadrilles on them till they were thrashed out with much merriment and
very little labor

Tommys six weeks beans were a failure for a dry spell early in the
season hurt them because he gave them no water and after that he was
so sure that they could take care of themselves he let the poor
things struggle with bugs and weeds till they were exhausted and died
a lingering death So Tommy had to dig his farm over again and plant
peas But they were late the birds ate many the bushes not being
firmly planted blew down and when the poor peas came at last no one
cared for them as their day was over and springlamb had grown
into mutton Tommy consoled himself with a charitable effort for he
transplanted all the thistles he could find and tended them carefully
for Toby who was fond of the prickly delicacy and had eaten all he
could find on the place The boys had great fun over Toms thistle
bed but he insisted that it was better to care for poor Toby than for
himself and declared that he would devote his entire farm next year to
thistles worms and snails that Demis turtles and Nats pet owl might
have the food they loved as well as the donkey So like shiftless
kindhearted happygolucky Tommy

Demi had supplied his grandmother with lettuce all summer and in the
autumn sent his grandfather a basket of turnips each one scrubbed up
till it looked like a great white egg His Grandma was fond of salad
and one of his Grandpas favorite quotations was

 Lucullus whom frugality could charm
 Ate roasted turnips at the Sabine farm

Therefore these vegetable offerings to the dear domestic god and goddess
were affectionate appropriate and classical

Daisy had nothing but flowers in her little plot and it bloomed all
summer long with a succession of gay or fragrant posies She was very
fond of her garden and delved away in it at all hours watching over
her roses and pansies sweetpeas and mignonette as faithfully and
tenderly as she did over her dolls or her friends Little nosegays were
sent into town on all occasions and certain vases about the house
were her especial care She had all sorts of pretty fancies about her
flowers and loved to tell the children the story of the pansy and show
them how the stepmotherleaf sat up in her green chair in purple and
gold how the two own children in gay yellow had each its little seat
while the step children in dull colors both sat on one small stool
and the poor little father in his red nightcap was kept out of sight
in the middle of the flower that a monks dark face looked out of the
monkshood larkspur that the flowers of the canaryvine were so like
dainty birds fluttering their yellow wings that one almost expected
to see them fly away and the snapdragons that went off like little
pistolshots when you cracked them Splendid dollies did she make out of
scarlet and white poppies with ruffled robes tied round the waist with
grass blade sashes and astonishing hats of coreopsis on their
green heads Peapod boats with roseleaf sails received these
flowerpeople and floated them about a placid pool in the most charming
style for finding that there were no elves Daisy made her own
and loved the fanciful little friends who played their parts in her
summerlife

Nan went in for herbs and had a fine display of useful plants which
she tended with steadily increasing interest and care Very busy was
she in September cutting drying and tying up her sweet harvest and
writing down in a little book how the different herbs are to be used
She had tried several experiments and made several mistakes so she
wished to be particular lest she should give little Huz another fit by
administering wormwood instead of catnip

Dick Dolly and Rob each grubbed away on his small farm and made more
stir about it than all the rest put together Parsnips and carrots were
the crops of the two Ds and they longed for it to be late enough to
pull up the precious vegetables Dick did privately examine his carrots
and plant them again feeling that Silas was right in saying it was too
soon for them yet

Robs crop was four small squashes and one immense pumpkin It really
was a bouncer as every one said and I assure you that two small
persons could sit on it side by side It seemed to have absorbed all the
goodness of the little garden and all the sunshine that shone down on
it and lay there a great round golden ball full of rich suggestions
of pumpkinpies for weeks to come Robby was so proud of his mammoth
vegetable that he took every one to see it and when frosts began to
nip covered it up each night with an old bedquilt tucking it round as
if the pumpkin was a wellbeloved baby The day it was gathered he would
let no one touch it but himself and nearly broke his back tugging it
to the barn in his little wheelbarrow with Dick and Dolly harnessed
in front to give a heave up the path His mother promised him that the
Thanksgivingpies should be made from it and hinted vaguely that she
had a plan in her head which would cover the prize pumpkin and its owner
with glory

Poor Billy had planted cucumbers but unfortunately hoed them up and
left the pigweed This mistake grieved him very much for tem minutes
then he forgot all about it and sowed a handful of bright buttons which
he had collected evidently thinking in his feeble mind that they
were money and would come up and multiply so that he might make many
quarters as Tommy did No one disturbed him and he did what he liked
with his plot which soon looked as if a series of small earthquakes
had stirred it up When the general harvestday came he would have
had nothing but stones and weeds to show if kind old Asia had not hung
halfadozen oranges on the dead tree he stuck up in the middle Billy
was delighted with his crop and no one spoiled his pleasure in the
little miracle which pity wrought for him by making withered branches
bear strange fruit

Stuffy had various trials with his melons for being impatient to taste
them he had a solitary revel before they were ripe and made himself so
ill that for a day or two it seemed doubtful if he would ever eat
any more But he pulled through it and served up his first cantaloupe
without tasting a mouthful himself They were excellent melons for he
had a warm slope for them and they ripened fast The last and best were
lingering on the vines and Stuffy had announced that he should sell
them to a neighbor This disappointed the boys who had hoped to eat
the melons themselves and they expressed their displeasure in a new
and striking manner Going one morning to gaze upon the three fine
watermelons which he had kept for the market Stuffy was horrified to
find the word PIG cut in white letters on the green rind staring
at him from every one He was in a great rage and flew to Mrs Jo for
redress She listened condoled with him and then said

If you want to turn the laugh Ill tell you how but you must give up
the melons

Well I will for I cant thrash all the boys but Id like to give
them something to remember the mean sneaks growled Stuff still in a
fume

Now Mrs Jo was pretty sure who had done the trick for she had seen
three heads suspiciously near to one another in the sofacorner the
evening before and when these heads had nodded with chuckles and
whispers this experienced woman knew mischief was afoot A moonlight
night a rustling in the old cherrytree near Emils window a cut on
Tommys finger all helped to confirm her suspicions and having cooled
Stuffys wrath a little she bade him bring his maltreated melons to her
room and say not a word to any one of what had happened He did so
and the three wags were amazed to find their joke so quietly taken It
spoilt the fun and the entire disappearance of the melons made them
uneasy So did Stuffys goodnature for he looked more placid and plump
than ever and surveyed them with an air of calm pity that perplexed
them very much

At dinnertime they discovered why for then Stuffys vengeance fell
upon them and the laugh was turned against them When the pudding was
eaten and the fruit was put on Mary Ann reappeared in a high state of
giggle bearing a large watermelon Silas followed with another and
Dan brought up the rear with a third One was placed before each of the
three guilty lads and they read on the smooth green skins this addition
to their own work With the compliments of the PIG Every one else
read it also and the whole table was in a roar for the trick had been
whispered about so every one understood the sequel Emil Ned
and Tommy did not know where to look and had not a word to say for
themselves so they wisely joined in the laugh cut up the melons and
handed them round saying what all the rest agreed to that Stuffy had
taken a wise and merry way to return good for evil

Dan had no garden for he was away or lame the greater part of the
summer so he had helped Silas wherever he could chopped wood for Asia
and taken care of the lawn so well that Mrs Jo always had smooth paths
and nicely shaven turf before her door

When the others got in their crops he looked sorry that he had so
little to show but as autumn went on he bethought himself of a
woodland harvest which no one would dispute with him and which was
peculiarly his own Every Saturday he was away alone to the forests
fields and hills and always came back loaded with spoils for he
seemed to know the meadows where the best flagroot grew the thicket
where the sassafras was spiciest the haunts where the squirrels went
for nuts the white oak whose bark was most valuable and the little
goldthread vine that Nursey liked to cure the canker with All sorts of
splendid red and yellow leaves did Dan bring home for Mrs Jo to dress
her parlor with gracefulseeded grasses clematis tassels downy soft
yellow waxwork berries and mosses redbrimmed white or emerald
green

I need not sigh for the woods now because Dan brings the woods to me
Mrs Jo used to say as she glorified the walls with yellow maple boughs
and scarlet woodbine wreaths or filled her vases with russet ferns
hemlock sprays full of delicate cones and hardy autumn flowers for
Dans crop suited her well

The great garret was full of the childrens little stores and for a time
was one of the sights of the house Daisys flower seeds in neat little
paper bags all labelled lay in a drawer of a threelegged table
Nans herbs hung in bunches against the wall filling the air with their
aromatic breath Tommy had a basket of thistledown with the tiny seeds
attached for he meant to plant them next year if they did not all fly
away before that time Emil had bunches of popcorn hanging there to
dry and Demi laid up acorns and different sorts of grain for the pets
But Dans crop made the best show for fully one half of the floor was
covered with the nuts he brought All kinds were there for he ranged
the woods for miles round climbed the tallest trees and forced his way
into the thickest hedges for his plunder Walnuts chestnuts hazelnuts
and beechnuts lay in separate compartments getting brown and dry and
sweet ready for winter revels

There was one butternuttree on the place and Rob and Teddy called it
theirs It bore well this year and the great dingy nuts came dropping
down to hide among the dead leaves where the busy squirrels found them
better than the lazy Bhaers Their father had told them the boys not
the squirrels they should have the nuts if they would pick them up but
no one was to help It was easy work and Teddy liked it only he soon
got tired and left his little basket half full for another day But the
other day was slow to arrive and meantime the sly squirrels were hard
at work scampering up and down the old elmtrees stowing the nuts away
till their holes were full then all about the crotches of the boughs
to be removed at their leisure Their funny little ways amused the boys
till one day Silas said

Hev you sold them nuts to the squirrels

No answered Rob wondering what Silas meant

Wal then youd better fly round or them spry little fellers wont
leave you none

Oh we can beat them when we begin There are such lots of nuts we
shall have a plenty

There aint many more to come down and they have cleared the ground
pretty well see if they haint

Robby ran to look and was alarmed to find how few remained He called
Teddy and they worked hard all one afternoon while the squirrels sat
on the fence and scolded

Now Ted we must keep watch and pick up just as fast as they fall or
we shant have more than a bushel and every one will laugh at us if we
dont

The naughty quillies tarnt have em Ill pick fast and run and put
em in the barn twick said Teddy frowning at little Frisky who
chattered and whisked his tail indignantly

That night a high wind blew down hundreds of nuts and when Mrs Jo came
to wake her little sons she said briskly

Come my laddies the squirrels are hard at it and you will have to
work well today or they will have every nut on the ground

No they wont and Robby tumbled up in a great hurry gobbled his
breakfast and rushed out to save his property

Teddy went too and worked like a little beaver trotting to and fro
with full and empty baskets Another bushel was soon put away in the
cornbarn and they were scrambling among the leaves for more nuts when
the bell rang for school

O father let me stay out and pick Those horrid squirrels will have
my nuts if you dont Ill do my lessons by and by cried Rob running
into the schoolroom flushed and tousled by the fresh cold wind and his
eager work

If you had been up early and done a little every morning there would be
no hurry now I told you that Rob and you never minded I cannot have
the lessons neglected as the work has been The squirrels will get more
than their share this year and they deserve it for they have worked
best You may go an hour earlier but that is all and Mr Bhaer led
Rob to his place where the little man dashed at his books as if bent on
making sure of the precious hour promised him

It was almost maddening to sit still and see the wind shaking down the
last nuts and the lively thieves flying about pausing now and then to
eat one in his face and flirt their tails as if they said saucily
Well have them in spite of you lazy Rob The only thing that
sustained the poor child in this trying moment was the sight of
Teddy working away all alone It was really splendid the pluck and
perseverance of the little lad He picked and picked till his back
ached he trudged to and fro till his small legs were tired and he
defied wind weariness and wicked quillies till his mother left
her work and did the carrying for him full of admiration for the kind
little fellow who tried to help his brother When Rob was dismissed he
found Teddy reposing in the bushelbasket quite used up but unwilling
to quit the field for he flapped his hat at the thieves with one grubby
little hand while he refreshed himself with the big apple held in the
other

Rob fell to work and the ground was cleared before two oclock the nuts
safely in the cornbarn loft and the weary workers exulted in their
success But Frisky and his wife were not to be vanquished so easily
and when Rob went up to look at his nuts a few days later he was amazed
to see how many had vanished None of the boys could have stolen them
because the door had been locked the doves could not have eaten them
and there were no rats about There was great lamentation among the
young Bhaers till Dick said

I saw Frisky on the roof of the cornbarn may be he took them

I know he did Ill have a trap and kill him dead cried Rob
disgusted with Friskys grasping nature

Perhaps if you watch you can find out where he puts them and I may
be able to get them back for you said Dan who was much amused by the
fight between the boys and squirrels

So Rob watched and saw Mr and Mrs Frisky drop from the drooping elm
boughs on to the roof of the cornbarn dodge in at one of the little
doors much to the disturbance of the doves and come out with a nut in
each mouth So laden they could not get back the way they came but
ran down the low roof along the wall and leaping off at a corner they
vanished a minute and reappeared without their plunder Rob ran to the
place and in a hollow under the leaves he found a heap of the stolen
property hidden away to be carried off to the holes by and by

Oh you little villains Ill cheat you now and not leave one said
Rob So he cleared the corner and the cornbarn and put the contested
nuts in the garret making sure that no broken windowpane could
anywhere let in the unprincipled squirrels They seemed to feel that the
contest was over and retired to their hole but now and then could not
resist throwing down nutshells on Robs head and scolding violently
as if they could not forgive him nor forget that he had the best of the
battle

Father and Mother Bhaers crop was of a different sort and not so
easily described but they were satisfied with it felt that their
summer work had prospered well and by and by had a harvest that made
them very happy



CHAPTER XIX JOHN BROOKE

Wake up Demi dear I want you

Why Ive just gone to bed it cant be morning yet and Demi blinked
like a little owl as he waked from his first sound sleep

Its only ten but your father is ill and we must go to him O my
little John my poor little John and Aunt Jo laid her head down on
the pillow with a sob that scared sleep from Demis eyes and filled his
heart with fear and wonder for he dimly felt why Aunt Jo called him
John and wept over him as if some loss had come that left him poor
He clung to her without a word and in a minute she was quite steady
again and said with a tender kiss as she saw his troubled face

We are going to say goodby to him my darling and there is no time to
lose so dress quickly and come to me in my room I must go to Daisy

Yes I will and when Aunt Jo was gone little Demi got up quietly
dressed as if in a dream and leaving Tommy fast asleep went away
through the silent house feeling that something new and sorrowful was
going to happen something that set him apart from the other boys for
a time and made the world seem as dark and still and strange as those
familiar rooms did in the night A carriage sent by Mr Laurie stood
before the door Daisy was soon ready and the brother and sister held
each other by the hand all the way into town as they drove swiftly and
silently with aunt and uncle through the shadowy roads to say goodby to
father

None of the boys but Franz and Emil knew what had happened and when
they came down next morning great was their wonderment and discomfort
for the house seemed forlorn without its master and mistress Breakfast
was a dismal meal with no cheery Mrs Jo behind the teapots and when
schooltime came Father Bhaers place was empty They wandered about in
a disconsolate kind of way for an hour waiting for news and hoping it
would be all right with Demis father for good John Brooke was much
beloved by the boys Ten oclock came and no one arrived to relieve
their anxiety They did not feel like playing yet the time dragged
heavily and they sat about listless and sober All at once Franz got
up and said in his persuasive way

Look here boys lets go into school and do our lessons just as if
Uncle was here It will make the day go faster and will please him I
know

But who will hear us say them asked Jack

I will I dont know much more than you do but Im the oldest here
and Ill try to fill Uncles place till he comes if you dont mind

Something in the modest serious way Franz said this impressed the boys
for though the poor lads eyes were red with quiet crying for Uncle
John in that long sad night there was a new manliness about him as if
he had already begun to feel the cares and troubles of life and tried
to take them bravely

I will for one and Emil went to his seat remembering that obedience
to his superior officer is a seamans first duty

The others followed Franz took his uncles seat and for an hour
order reigned Lessons were learned and said and Franz made a patient
pleasant teacher wisely omitting such lessons as he was not equal to
and keeping order more by the unconscious dignity that sorrow gave him
than by any words of his own The little boys were reading when a step
was heard in the hall and every one looked up to read the news in Mr
Bhaers face as he came in The kind face told them instantly that Demi
had no father now for it was worn and pale and full of tender grief
which left him no words with which to answer Rob as he ran to him
saying reproachfully

What made you go and leave me in the night papa

The memory of the other father who had left his children in the night
never to return made Mr Bhaer hold his own boy close and for a
minute hide his face in Robbys curly hair Emil laid his head down
on his arms Franz went to put his hand on his uncles shoulder his
boyish face pale with sympathy and sorrow and the others sat so still
that the soft rustle of the falling leaves outside was distinctly heard

Rob did not clearly understand what had happened but he hated to see
papa unhappy so he lifted up the bent head and said in his chirpy
little voice

Dont cry mein Vater we were all so good we did our lessons without
you and Franz was the master

Mr Bhaer looked up then tried to smile and said in a grateful tone
that made the lads feel like saints I thank you very much my boys
It was a beautiful way to help and comfort me I shall not forget it I
assure you

Franz proposed it and was a firstrate master too said Nat and the
others gave a murmur of assent most gratifying to the young dominie

Mr Bhaer put Rob down and standing up put his arm round his tall
nephews shoulder as he said with a look of genuine pleasure

This makes my hard day easier and gives me confidence in you all I
am needed there in town and must leave you for some hours I thought
to give you a holiday or send some of you home but if you like to stay
and go on as you have begun I shall be glad and proud of my good boys

Well stay Wed rather Franz can see to us cried several
delighted with the confidence shown in them

Isnt Marmar coming home asked Rob wistfully for home without
Marmar was the world without the sun to him

We shall both come tonight but dear Aunt Meg needs Mother more than
you do now and I know you like to lend her for a little while

Well I will but Teddys been crying for her and he slapped Nursey
and was dreadful naughty answered Rob as if the news might bring
mother home

Where is my little man asked Mr Bhaer

Dan took him out to keep him quiet Hes all right now said Franz
pointing to the window through which they could see Dan drawing baby in
his little wagon with the dogs frolicking about him

I wont see him it would only upset him again but tell Dan I leave
Teddy in his care You older boys I trust to manage yourselves for a
day Franz will direct you and Silas is here to over see matters So
goodby till tonight

Just tell me a word about Uncle John said Emil detaining Mr Bhaer
as he was about hurrying away again

He was only ill a few hours and died as he has lived so cheerfully
so peacefully that it seems a sin to mar the beauty of it with any
violent or selfish grief We were in time to say goodby and Daisy and
Demi were in his arms as he fell asleep on Aunt Megs breast No more
now I cannot bear it and Mr Bhaer went hastily away quite bowed with
grief for in John Brooke he had lost both friend and brother and there
was no one left to take his place

All that day the house was very still the small boys played quietly in
the nursery the others feeling as if Sunday had come in the middle
of the week spent it in walking sitting in the willow or among their
pets all talking much of Uncle John and feeling that something
gentle just and strong had gone out of their little world leaving a
sense of loss that deepened every hour At dusk Mr and Mrs Bhaer came
home alone for Demi and Daisy were their mothers best comfort now
and could not leave her Poor Mrs Jo seemed quite spent and evidently
needed the same sort of comfort for her first words as she came up the
stairs were Where is my baby

Here I is answered a little voice as Dan put Teddy into her arms
adding as she hugged him close My Danny tooked tare of me all day
and I was dood

Mrs Jo turned to thank the faithful nurse but Dan was waving off the
boys who had gathered in the hall to meet her and was saying in a low
voice Keep back she dont want to be bothered with us now

No dont keep back I want you all Come in and see me my boys Ive
neglected you all day and Mrs Jo held out her hands to them as they
gathered round and escorted her into her own room saying little but
expressing much by affectionate looks and clumsy little efforts to show
their sorrow and sympathy

I am so tired I will lie here and cuddle Teddy and you shall bring me
in some tea she said trying to speak cheerfully for their sakes

A general stampede into the diningroom followed and the suppertable
would have been ravaged if Mr Bhaer had not interfered It was agreed
that one squad should carry in the mothers tea and another bring it
out The four nearest and dearest claimed the first honor so Franz bore
the teapot Emil the bread Rob the milk and Teddy insisted on carrying
the sugar basin which was lighter by several lumps when it arrived than
when it started Some women might have found it annoying at such a time
to have boys creaking in and out upsetting cups and rattling spoons in
violent efforts to be quiet and helpful but it suited Mrs Jo because
just then her heart was very tender and remembering that many of her
boys were fatherless or motherless she yearned over them and found
comfort in their blundering affection It was the sort of food that did
her more good than the very thick breadandbutter that they gave her
and the rough Commodores broken whisper

Bear up Aunty its a hard blow but well weather it somehow
cheered her more than the sloppy cup he brought her full of tea as
bitter as if some salt tear of his own had dropped into it on the way
When supper was over a second deputation removed the tray and Dan
said holding out his arms for sleepy little Teddy

Let me put him to bed youre so tired Mother

Will you go with him lovey asked Mrs Jo of her small lord and
master who lay on her arm among the sofapillows

Torse I will and he was proudly carried off by his faithful bearer

I wish I could do something said Nat with a sigh as Franz leaned
over the sofa and softly stroked Aunt Jos hot forehead

You can dear Go and get your violin and play me the sweet little
airs Uncle Teddy sent you last Music will comfort me better than any
thing else tonight

Nat flew for his fiddle and sitting just outside her door played as
he had never done before for now his heart was in it and seemed
to magnetize his fingers The other lads sat quietly upon the steps
keeping watch that no newcomer should disturb the house Franz lingered
at his post and so soothed served and guarded by her boys poor Mrs
Jo slept at last and forgot her sorrow for an hour

Two quiet days and on the third Mr Bhaer came in just after school
with a note in his hand looking both moved and pleased

I want to read you something boys he said and as they stood round
him he read this

DEAR BROTHER FRITZ I hear that you do not mean to bring your flock
today thinking that I may not like it Please do The sight of his
friends will help Demi through the hard hour and I want the boys to
hear what father says of my John It will do them good I know If they
would sing one of the sweet old hymns you have taught them so well
I should like it better than any other music and feel that it was
beautifully suited to the occasion Please ask them with my love

MEG

Will you go and Mr Bhaer looked at the lads who were greatly
touched by Mrs Brookes kind words and wishes

Yes they answered like one boy and an hour later they went away
with Franz to bear their part in John Brookes simple funeral

The little house looked as quiet sunny and homelike as when Meg
entered it as a bride ten years ago only then it was early summer
and rose blossomed everywhere now it was early autumn and dead leaves
rustled softly down leaving the branches bare The bride was a widow
now but the same beautiful serenity shone in her face and the sweet
resignation of a truly pious soul made her presence a consolation to
those who came to comfort her

O Meg how can you bear it so whispered Jo as she met them at the
door with a smile of welcome and no change in her gentle manner except
more gentleness

Dear Jo the love that has blest me for ten happy years supports me
still It could not die and John is more my own than ever whispered
Meg and in her eyes the tender trust was so beautiful and bright that
Jo believed her and thanked God for the immortality of love like hers

They were all there father and mother Uncle Teddy and Aunt Amy old
Mr Laurence whitehaired and feeble now Mr and Mrs Bhaer with
their flock and many friends come to do honor to the dead One would
have said that modest John Brooke in his busy quiet humble life
had had little time to make friends but now they seemed to start
up everywhere old and young rich and poor high and low for all
unconsciously his influence had made itself widely felt his virtues
were remembered and his hidden charities rose up to bless him The
group about his coffin was a far more eloquent eulogy than any Mr March
could utter There were the rich men whom he had served faithfully for
years the poor old women whom he cherished with his little store in
memory of his mother the wife to whom he had given such happiness that
death could not mar it utterly the brothers and sisters in whose hearts
he had made a place for ever the little son and daughter who already
felt the loss of his strong arm and tender voice the young children
sobbing for their kindest playmate and the tall lads watching with
softened faces a scene which they never could forget A very simple
service and very short for the fatherly voice that had faltered in the
marriagesacrament now failed entirely as Mr March endeavored to pay
his tribute of reverence and love to the son whom he most honored
Nothing but the soft coo of Baby Josys voice upstairs broke the long
hush that followed the last Amen till at a sign from Mr Bhaer the
welltrained boyish voices broke out in a hymn so full of lofty cheer
that one by one all joined in it singing with full hearts and finding
their troubled spirits lifted into peace on the wings of that brave
sweet psalm

As Meg listened she felt that she had done well for not only did the
moment comfort her with the assurance that Johns last lullaby was sung
by the young voices he loved so well but in the faces of the boys she
saw that they had caught a glimpse of the beauty of virtue in its most
impressive form and that the memory of the good man lying dead before
them would live long and helpfully in their remembrance Daisys head
lay in her lap and Demi held her hand looking often at her with eyes
so like his fathers and a little gesture that seemed to say Dont
be troubled mother I am here and all about her were friends to lean
upon and love so patient pious Meg put by her heavy grief feeling
that her best help would be to live for others as her John had done

That evening as the Plumfield boys sat on the steps as usual in the
mild September moonlight they naturally fell to talking of the event of
the day

Emil began by breaking out in his impetuous way Uncle Fritz is the
wisest and Uncle Laurie the jolliest but Uncle John was the best and
Id rather be like him than any man I ever saw

So would I Did you hear what those gentlemen said to Grandpa today I
would like to have that said of me when I was dead and Franz felt with
regret that he had not appreciated Uncle John enough

What did they say asked Jack who had been much impressed by the
scenes of the day

Why one of the partners of Mr Laurence where Uncle John has been
ever so long was saying that he was conscientious almost to a fault as
a business man and above reproach in all things Another gentleman said
no money could repay the fidelity and honesty with which Uncle John had
served him and then Grandpa told them the best of all Uncle John once
had a place in the office of a man who cheated and when this man wanted
uncle to help him do it uncle wouldnt though he was offered a big
salary The man was angry and said You will never get on in business
with such strict principles and uncle answered back I never will try
to get on without them and left the place for a much harder and poorer
one

Good cried several of the boys warmly for they were in the mood to
understand and value the little story as never before

He wasnt rich was he asked Jack

No

He never did any thing to make a stir in the world did he

No

He was only good

Thats all and Franz found himself wishing that Uncle John had done
something to boast of for it was evident that Jack was disappointed by
his replies

Only good That is all and every thing said Mr Bhaer who had
overheard the last few words and guessed what was going on the minds of
the lads

Let me tell you a little about John Brooke and you will see why men
honor him and why he was satisfied to be good rather than rich or
famous He simply did his duty in all things and did it so cheerfully
so faithfully that it kept him patient and brave and happy through
poverty and loneliness and years of hard work He was a good son and
gave up his own plans to stay and live with his mother while she needed
him He was a good friend and taught Laurie much beside his Greek and
Latin did it unconsciously perhaps by showing him an example of an
upright man He was a faithful servant and made himself so valuable to
those who employed him that they will find it hard to fill his place
He was a good husband and father so tender wise and thoughtful that
Laurie and I learned much of him and only knew how well he loved his
family when we discovered all he had done for them unsuspected and
unassisted

Mr Bhaer stopped a minute and the boys sat like statues in the
moonlight until he went on again in a subdued but earnest voice As
he lay dying I said to him Have no care for Meg and the little ones
I will see that they never want Then he smiled and pressed my hand
and answered in his cheerful way No need of that I have cared for
them And so he had for when we looked among his papers all was in
order not a debt remained and safely put away was enough to keep Meg
comfortable and independent Then we knew why he had lived so plainly
denied himself so many pleasures except that of charity and worked
so hard that I fear he shortened his good life He never asked help for
himself though often for others but bore his own burden and worked
out his own task bravely and quietly No one can say a word of complaint
against him so just and generous and kind was he and now when he is
gone all find so much to love and praise and honor that I am proud to
have been his friend and would rather leave my children the legacy he
leaves his than the largest fortune ever made Yes Simple generous
goodness is the best capital to found the business of this life upon It
lasts when fame and money fail and is the only riches we can take out
of this world with us Remember that my boys and if you want to earn
respect and confidence and love follow in the footsteps of John Brooke

When Demi returned to school after some weeks at home he seemed to
have recovered from his loss with the blessed elasticity of childhood
and so he had in a measure but he did not forget for his was a nature
into which things sank deeply to be pondered over and absorbed into
the soil where the small virtues were growing fast He played and
studied worked and sang just as before and few suspected any change
but there was one and Aunt Jo saw it for she watched over the boy with
her whole heart trying to fill Johns place in her poor way He seldom
spoke of his loss but Aunt Jo often heard a stifled sobbing in the
little bed at night and when she went to comfort him all his cry was
I want my father oh I want my father for the tie between the two
had been a very tender one and the childs heart bled when it was
broken But time was kind to him and slowly he came to feel that father
was not lost only invisible for a while and sure to be found again
well and strong and fond as ever even though his little son should see
the purple asters blossom on his grave many many times before they met
To this belief Demi held fast and in it found both help and comfort
because it led him unconsciously through a tender longing for the father
whom he had seen to a childlike trust in the Father whom he had not
seen Both were in heaven and he prayed to both trying to be good for
love of them

The outward change corresponded to the inward for in those few weeks
Demi seemed to have grown tall and began to drop his childish plays
not as if ashamed of them as some boys do but as if he had outgrown
them and wanted something manlier He took to the hated arithmetic
and held on so steadily that his uncle was charmed though he could not
understand the whim until Demi said

I am going to be a bookkeeper when I grow up like papa and I must
know about figures and things else I cant have nice neat ledgers like
his

At another time he came to his aunt with a very serious face and said

What can a small boy do to earn money

Why do you ask my deary

My father told me to take care of mother and the little girls and I
want to but I dont know how to begin

He did not mean now Demi but by and by when you are large

But I wish to begin now if I can because I think I ought to make some
money to buy things for the family I am ten and other boys no bigger
than I earn pennies sometimes

Well then suppose you rake up all the dead leaves and cover the
strawberry bed Ill pay you a dollar for the job said Aunt Jo

Isnt that a great deal I could do it in one day You must be fair
and no pay too much because I want to truly earn it

My little John I will be fair and not pay a penny too much Dont
work too hard and when that is done I will have something else for you
to do said Mrs Jo much touched by his desire to help and his sense
of justice so like his scrupulous father

When the leaves were done many barrowloads of chips were wheeled from
the wood to the shed and another dollar earned Then Demi helped
cover the schoolbooks working in the evenings under Franzs direction
tugging patiently away at each book letting no one help and receiving
his wages with such satisfaction that the dingy bills became quite
glorified in his sight

Now I have a dollar for each of them and I should like to take
my money to mother all myself so she can see that I have minded my
father

So Demi made a duteous pilgrimage to his mother who received his little
earnings as a treasure of great worth and would have kept it untouched
if Demi had not begged her to buy some useful thing for herself and the
womenchildren whom he felt were left to his care

This made him very happy and though he often forgot his
responsibilities for a time the desire to help was still there
strengthening with his years He always uttered the words my father
with an air of gentle pride and often said as if he claimed a title
full of honor Dont call me Demi any more I am John Brooke now
So strengthened by a purpose and a hope the little lad of ten bravely
began the world and entered into his inheritance the memory of a wise
and tender father the legacy of an honest name



CHAPTER XX ROUND THE FIRE

With the October frosts came the cheery fires in the great fireplaces
and Demis dry pinechips helped Dans oakknots to blaze royally and
go roaring up the chimney with a jolly sound All were glad to gather
round the hearth as the evenings grew longer to play games read or
lay plans for the winter But the favorite amusement was storytelling
and Mr and Mrs Bhaer were expected to have a store of lively tales
always on hand Their supply occasionally gave out and then the boys
were thrown upon their own resources which were not always successful
Ghostparties were the rage at one time for the fun of the thing
consisted in putting out the lights letting the fire die down and then
sitting in the dark and telling the most awful tales they could invent
As this resulted in scares of all sorts among the boys Tommys walking
in his sleep on the shed roof and a general state of nervousness in
the little ones it was forbidden and they fell back on more harmless
amusements

One evening when the small boys were snugly tucked in bed and the
older lads were lounging about the schoolroom fire trying to decide
what they should do Demi suggested a new way of settling the question

Seizing the hearthbrush he marched up and down the room saying Row
row row and when the boys laughing and pushing had got into line
he said Now Ill give you two minutes to think of a play Franz was
writing and Emil reading the Life of Lord Nelson and neither joined
the party but the others thought hard and when the time was up were
ready to reply

Now Tom and the poker softly rapped him on the head

Blindmans Buff

Jack

Commerce a good round game and have cents for the pool

Uncle forbids our playing for money Dan what do you want

Lets have a battle between the Greeks and Romans

Stuffy

Roast apples pop corn and crack nuts

Good good cried several and when the vote was taken Stuffys
proposal carried the day

Some went to the cellar for apples some to the garret for nuts and
others looked up the popper and the corn

We had better ask the girls to come in hadnt we said Demi in a
sudden fit of politeness

Daisy pricks chestnuts beautifully put in Nat who wanted his little
friend to share the fun

Nan pops corn tiptop we must have her added Tommy

Bring in your sweethearts then we dont mind said Jack who laughed
at the innocent regard the little people had for one another

You shant call my sister a sweetheart it is so silly cried Demi in
a way that made Jack laugh

She is Nats darling isnt she old chirper

Yes if Demi dont mind I cant help being fond of her she is so good
to me answered Nat with bashful earnestness for Jacks rough ways
disturbed him

Nan is my sweetheart and I shall marry her in about a year so dont
you get in the way any of you said Tommy stoutly for he and Nan
had settled their future childfashion and were to live in the willow
lower down a basket for food and do other charmingly impossible things

Demi was quenched by the decision of Bangs who took him by the arm and
walked him off to get the ladies Nan and Daisy were sewing with Aunt Jo
on certain small garments for Mrs Carneys newest baby

Please maam could you lend us the girls for a little while Well
be very careful of them said Tommy winking one eye to express apples
snapping his fingers to signify popcorn and gnashing his teeth to
convey the idea of nutcracking

The girls understood this pantomime at once and began to pull of
their thimbles before Mrs Jo could decide whether Tommy was going
into convulsions or was brewing some unusual piece of mischief Demi
explained with elaboration permission was readily granted and the boys
departed with their prize

Dont you speak to Jack whispered Tommy as he and Nan promenaded
down the hall to get a fork to prick the apples

Why not

He laughs at me so I dont wish you to have any thing to do with him

Shall if I like said Nan promptly resenting this premature
assumption of authority on the part of her lord

Then I wont have you for my sweetheart

I dont care

Why Nan I thought you were fond of me and Tommys voice was full of
tender reproach

If you mind Jacks laughing I dont care for you one bit

Then you may take back your old ring I wont wear it any longer and
Tommy plucked off a horsehair pledge of affection which Nan had given
him in return for one made of a lobsters feeler

I shall give it to Ned was her cruel reply for Ned liked Mrs
Giddygaddy and had turned her clothespins boxes and spools enough to
set up housekeeping with

Tommy said Thunder turtles as the only vent equal to the pentup
anguish of the moment and dropping Nans arm retired in high dudgeon
leaving her to follow with the fork a neglect which naughty Nan
punished by proceeding to prick his heart with jealousy as if it were
another sort of apple

The hearth was swept and the rosy Baldwins put down to roast A shovel
was heated and the chestnuts danced merrily upon it while the corn
popped wildly in its wire prison Dan cracked his best walnuts and
every one chattered and laughed while the rain beat on the windowpane
and the wind howled round the house

Why is Billy like this nut asked Emil who was frequently inspired
with bad conundrums

Because he is cracked answered Ned

Thats not fair you mustnt make fun of Billy because he cant hit
back again Its mean cried Dan smashing a nut wrathfully

To what family of insects does Blake belong asked peacemaker Franz
seeing that Emil looked ashamed and Dan lowering

Gnats answered Jack

Why is Daisy like a bee cried Nat who had been wrapt in thought for
several minutes

Because she is queen of the hive said Dan

No

Because she is sweet

Bees are not sweet

Give it up

Because she makes sweet things is always busy and likes flowers
said Nat piling up his boyish compliments till Daisy blushed like a
rosy clover

Why is Nan like a hornet demanded Tommy glowering at her and
adding without giving any one time to answer Because she isnt sweet
makes a great buzzing about nothing and stings like fury

Tommys mad and Im glad cried Ned as Nan tossed her head and
answered quickly

What thing in the chinacloset is Tom like

A pepper pot answered Ned giving Nan a nut meat with a tantalizing
laugh that made Tommy feel as if he would like to bounce up like a hot
chestnut and hit somebody

Seeing that illhumor was getting the better of the small supply of wit
in the company Franz cast himself into the breach again

Lets make a law that the first person who comes into the room shall
tell us a story No matter who it is he must do it and it will be fun
to see who comes first

The others agreed and did not have to wait long for a heavy step soon
came clumping through the hall and Silas appeared bearing an armful
of wood He was greeted by a general shout and stood staring about him
with a bewildered grin on his big red face till Franz explained the
joke

Sho I cant tell a story he said putting down his load and
preparing to leave the room But the boys fell upon him forced him into
a seat and held him there laughing and clamoring for their story
till the goodnatured giant was overpowered

I dont know but jest one story and thats about a horse he said
much flattered by the reception he received

Tell it tell it cried the boys

Wal began Silas tipping his chair back against the wall and
putting his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat I jined a cavalry
regiment durin the war and see a considable amount of fightin My
horse Major was a fustrate animal and I was as fond on him as
ef hed ben a human critter He warnt harnsome but he was the
besttempered stiddyest lovenest brute I ever see I fust battle we
went into he gave me a lesson that I didnt forgit in a hurry and
Ill tell you how it was It aint no use tryin to picter the noise and
hurry and general horridness of a battle to you young fellers for I
aint no words to do it in but Im free to confess that I got so sort
of confused and upset at the fust on it that I didnt know what I was
about We was ordered to charge and went ahead like good ones never
stoppin to pick up them that went down in the scrimmage I got a shot
in the arm and was pitched out of the saddle dont know how but there
I was left behind with two or three others dead and wounded for the
rest went on as I say Wal I picked myself up and looked round for
Major feeling as ef Id had about enough for that spell I didnt see
him nowhere and was kinder walking back to camp when I heard a whinny
that sounded nateral I looked round and there was Major stopping for
me a long way off and lookin as ef he didnt understand why I was
loiterin behind I whistled and he trotted up to me as Id trained him
to do I mounted as well as I could with my left arm bleedin and was
for going on to camp for I declare I felt as sick and wimbly as a
woman folks often do in their fust battle But no sir Major was the
bravest of the two and he wouldnt go not a peg he jest rared up and
danced and snorted and acted as ef the smell of powder and the noise
had drove him half wild I done my best but he wouldnt give in so
I did and what do you think that plucky brute done He wheeled slap
round and galloped back like a hurricane right into the thickest of
the scrimmage

Good for him cried Dan excitedly while the other boys forgot apples
and nuts in their interest

I wish I may die ef I warnt ashamed of myself continued Silas
warming up at the recollection of that day I was mad as a hornet and
I forgot my waound and jest pitched in rampagin raound like fury till
there come a shell into the midst of us and in bustin knocked a lot
of us flat I didnt know nothin for a spell and when I cometo the
fight was over just there and I found myself layin by a wall of poor
Major longside wuss wounded than I was My leg was broke and I had a
ball in my shoulder but he poor old feller was all tore in the side
with a piece of that blasted shell

O Silas what did you do cried Nan pressing close to him with a face
full of eager sympathy and interest

I dragged myself nigher and tried to stop the bleedin with sech rags
as I could tear off of me with one hand But it warnt no use and he
lay moanin with horrid pain and lookin at me with them lovin eyes of
his till I thought I couldnt bear it I give him all the help I could
and when the sun got hotter and hotter and he began to lap out his
tongue I tried to get to a brook that was a good piece away but I
couldnt do it being stiff and faint so I give it up and fanned him
with my hat Now you listen to this and when you hear folks comin down
on the rebs you jest remember what one on em did and give him credit
of it I poor feller in gray laid not fur off shot through the lungs
and dyin fast Id offered him my handkerchief to keep the sun off his
face and hed thanked me kindly for in sech times as that men dont
stop to think on which side they belong but jest buckleto and help one
another When he see me mournin over Major and tryin to ease his pain
he looked up with his face all damp and white with sufferin and sez
he Theres water in my canteen take it for it cant help me and he
flung it to me I couldnt have took it ef I hadnt had a little brandy
in a pocket flask and I made him drink it It done him good and I felt
as much set up as if Id drunk it myself Its surprisin the good sech
little things do folks sometime and Silas paused as if he felt again
the comfort of that moment when he and his enemy forgot their feud and
helped one another like brothers

Tell about Major cried the boys impatient for the catastrophe

I poured the water over his poor pantin tongue and ef ever a dumb
critter looked grateful he did then But it warnt of much use for
the dreadful waound kep on tormentin him till I couldnt bear it any
longer It was hard but I done it in mercy and I know he forgive me

What did you do asked Emil as Silas stopped abruptly with a loud
hem and a look in his rough face that made Daisy go and stand by him
with her little hand on his knee

I shot him

Quite a thrill went through the listeners as Silas said that for
Major seemed a hero in their eyes and his tragic end roused all their
sympathy

Yes I shot him and put him out of his misery I patted him fust and
said Goodby then I laid his head easy on the grass give a last
look into his lovin eyes and sent a bullet through his head He hardly
stirred I aimed so true and when I seen him quite still with no more
moanin and pain I was glad and yet wal I dont know as I need by
ashamed ont I jest put my arms raound his neck and boohooed like a
great baby Sho I didnt know I was sech a fool and Silas drew his
sleeve across his eyes as much touched by Daisys sob as by the memory
of faithful Major

No one spoke for a minute because the boys were as quick to feel the
pathos of the little story as tenderhearted Daisy though they did not
show it by crying

Id like a horse like that said Dan halfaloud

Did the rebel man die too asked Nan anxiously

Not then We laid there all day and at night some of our fellers came
to look after the missing ones They natrally wanted to take me fust
but I knew I could wait and the rebel had but one chance maybe so I
made them carry him off right away He had jest strength enough to hold
out his hand to me and say Thanky comrade and them was the last
words he spoke for he died an hour after he got to the hospitaltent

How glad you must have been that you were kind to him said Demi who
was deeply impressed by this story

Wal I did take comfort thinkin of it as I laid there alone for a
number of hours with my head on Majors neck and see the moon come up
Id like to have buried the poor beast decent but it warnt possible
so I cut off a bit of his mane and Ive kep it ever sence Want to see
it sissy

Oh yes please answered Daisy wiping away her tears to look

Silas took out an old wallet as he called his pocketbook and
produced from an inner fold a bit of brown paper in which was a rough
lock of white horsehair The children looked at it silently as it lay
in the broad palm and no one found any thing to ridicule in the love
Silas bore his good horse Major

That is a sweet story and I like it though it did make me cry Thank
you very much Si and Daisy helped him fold and put away his little
relic while Nan stuffed a handful of popcorn into his pocket and the
boys loudly expressed their flattering opinions of his story feeling
that there had been two heroes in it

He departed quite overcome by his honors and the little conspirators
talked the tale over while they waited for their next victim It was
Mrs Jo who came in to measure Nan for some new pinafores she was
making for her They let her get well in and then pounced upon her
telling her the law and demanding the story Mrs Jo was very much
amused at the new trap and consented at once for the sound of happy
voices had been coming across the hall so pleasantly that she quite
longed to join them and forget her own anxious thoughts of Sister Meg

Am I the first mouse you have caught you sly pussiesinboots
she asked as she was conducted to the big chair supplied with
refreshments and surrounded by a flock of merryfaced listeners

They told her about Silas and his contribution and she slapped her
forehead in despair for she was quite at her wits end being called
upon so unexpectedly for a bran new tale

What shall I tell about she said

Boys was the general answer

Have a party in it said Daisy

And something good to eat added Stuffy

That reminds me of a story written years ago by a dear old lady I
used to be very fond of it and I fancy you will like it for it has
both boys and something good to eat in it

What is it called asked Demi

The Suspected Boy

Nat looked up from the nuts he was picking and Mrs Jo smiled at him
guessing what was in his mind

Miss Crane kept a school for boys in a quiet little town and a very
good school it was of the oldfashioned sort Six boys lived in her
house and four or five more came in from the town Among those who
lived with her was one named Lewis White Lewis was not a bad boy but
rather timid and now and then he told a lie One day a neighbor sent
Miss Crane a basket of gooseberries There were not enough to go round
so kind Miss Crane who liked to please her boys went to work and made
a dozen nice little gooseberry tarts

Id like to try gooseberry tarts I wonder if she made them as I do
my raspberry ones said Daisy whose interest in cooking had lately
revived

Hush said Nat tucking a plump popcorn into her mouth to silence
her for he felt a particular interest in this tale and thought it
opened well

When the tarts were done Miss Crane put them away in the best parlor
closet and said not a word about them for she wanted to surprise the
boys at teatime When the minute came and all were seated at table she
went to get her tarts but came back looking much troubled for what do
you think had happened

Somebody had hooked them cried Ned

No there they were but some one had stolen all the fruit out of
them by lifting up the upper crust and then putting it down after the
gooseberry had been scraped out

What a mean trick and Nan looked at Tommy as if to imply that he
would do the same

When she told the boys her plan and showed them the poor little
patties all robbed of their sweetness the boys were much grieved and
disappointed and all declared that they knew nothing about the matter
Perhaps the rats did it said Lewis who was among the loudest to deny
any knowledge of the tarts No rats would have nibbled crust and all
and never lifted it up and scooped out the fruit Hands did that said
Miss Crane who was more troubled about the lie that some one must have
told than about her lost patties Well they had supper and went to bed
but in the night Miss Crane heard some one groaning and going to
see who it was she found Lewis in great pain He had evidently eaten
something that disagreed with him and was so sick that Miss Crane was
alarmed and was going to send for the doctor when Lewis moaned out
Its the gooseberries I ate them and I must tell before I die for
the thought of a doctor frightened him If that is all Ill give you
an emetic and you will soon get over it said Miss Crane So Lewis had
a good dose and by morning was quite comfortable Oh dont tell the
boys they will laugh at me so begged the invalid Kind Miss Crane
promised not to but Sally the girl told the story and poor Lewis had
no peace for a long time His mates called him Old Gooseberry and were
never tired of asking him the price of tarts

Served him right said Emil

Badness always gets found out added Demi morally

No it dont muttered Jack who was tending the apples with great
devotion so that he might keep his back to the rest and account for his
red face

Is that all asked Dan

No that is only the first part the second part is more interesting
Some time after this a peddler came by one day and stopped to show his
things to the boys several of whom bought pocketcombs jewsharps
and various trifles of that sort Among the knives was a little
whitehandled penknife that Lewis wanted very much but he had spent all
his pocketmoney and no one had any to lend him He held the knife in
his hand admiring and longing for it till the man packed up his goods
to go then he reluctantly laid it down and the man went on his way
The next day however the peddler returned to say that he could not
find that very knife and thought he must have left it at Miss Cranes
It was a very nice one with a pearl handle and he could not afford
to lose it Every one looked and every one declared they knew nothing
about it This young gentleman had it last and seemed to want it very
much Are you quite sure you put it back said the man to Lewis who
was much troubled at the loss and vowed over and over again that he did
return it His denials seemed to do no good however for every one was
sure he had taken it and after a stormy scene Miss Crane paid for it
and the man went grumbling away

Did Lewis have it cried Nat much excited

You will see Now poor Lewis had another trial to bear for the boys
were constantly saying Lend me your pearlhandled knife Gooseberry
and things of that sort till Lewis was so unhappy he begged to be sent
home Miss Crane did her best to keep the boys quiet but it was hard
work for they would tease and she could not be with them all the
time That is one of the hardest things to teach boys they wont hit
a fellow when he is down as they say but they will torment him in
little ways till he would thank them to fight it out all round

I know that said Dan

So do I added Nat softly

Jack said nothing but he quite agreed for he knew that the elder boys
despised him and let him alone for that very reason

Do go on about poor Lewis Aunt Jo I dont believe he took the knife
but I want to be sure said Daisy in great anxiety

Well week after week went on and the matter was not cleared up
The boys avoided Lewis and he poor fellow was almost sick with the
trouble he had brought upon himself He resolved never to tell another
lie and tried so hard that Miss Crane pitied and helped him and really
came at last to believe that he did not take the knife Two months after
the peddlers first visit he came again and the first thing he said
was

Well maam I found that knife after all It had slipped behind the
lining of my valise and fell out the other day when I was putting in a
new stock of goods I thought Id call and let you know as you paid for
it and maybe would like it so here it is

The boys had all gathered round and at these words they felt much
ashamed and begged Lewis pardon so heartily that he could not refuse
to give it Miss Crane presented the knife to him and he kept it many
years to remind him of the fault that had brought him so much trouble

I wonder why it is that things you eat on the sly hurt you and dont
when you eat them at table observed Stuffy thoughtfully

Perhaps your conscience affects your stomach said Mrs Jo smiling at
his speech

He is thinking of the cucumbers said Ned and a gale of merriment
followed the words for Stuffys last mishap had been a funny one

He ate two large cucumbers in private felt very ill and confided
his anguish to Ned imploring him to do something Ned goodnaturedly
recommended a mustard plaster and a hot flat iron to the feet only in
applying these remedies he reversed the order of things and put the
plaster on the feet the flat iron on the stomach and poor Stuffy was
found in the barn with blistered soles and a scorched jacket

Suppose you tell another story that was such an interesting one said
Nat as the laughter subsided

Before Mrs Jo could refuse these insatiable Oliver Twists Rob walked
into the room trailing his little bedcover after him and wearing
an expression of great sweetness as he said steering straight to his
mother as a sure haven of refuge

I heard a great noise and I thought sumfin dreffle might have
happened so I came to see

Did you think I would forget you naughty boy asked his mother
trying to look stern

No but I thought youd feel better to see me right here responded
the insinuating little party

I had much rather see you in bed so march straight up again Robin

Everybody that comes in here has to tell a story and you cant so
youd better cut and run said Emil

Yes I can I tell Teddy lots of ones all about bears and moons and
little flies that say things when they buzz protested Rob bound to
stay at any price

Tell one now then right away said Dan preparing to shoulder and
bear him off

Well I will let me fink a minute and Rob climbed into his mothers
lap where he was cuddled with the remark

It is a family failing this getting out of bed at wrong times Demi
used to do it and as for me I was hopping in and out all night long
Meg used to think the house was on fire and send me down to see and I
used to stay and enjoy myself as you mean to my bad son

Ive finked now observed Rob quite at his ease and eager to win the
entree into this delightful circle

Every one looked and listened with faces full of suppressed merriment as
Rob perched on his mothers knee and wrapped in the gay coverlet told
the following brief but tragic tale with an earnestness that made it
very funny

Once a lady had a million children and one nice little boy She went
upstairs and said You mustnt go in the yard But he wented and
fell into the pump and was drowned dead

Is that all asked Franz as Rob paused out of breath with this
startling beginning

No there is another piece of it and Rob knit his downy eyebrows in
the effort to evolve another inspiration

What did the lady do when he fell into the pump asked his mother to
help him on

Oh she pumped him up and wrapped him in a newspaper and put him on a
shelf to dry for seed

A general explosion of laughter greeted this surprising conclusion and
Mrs Jo patted the curly head as she said solemnly

My son you inherit your mothers gift of storytelling Go where glory
waits thee

Now I can stay cant I Wasnt it a good story cried Rob in high
feather at his superb success

You can stay till you have eaten these twelve popcorns said his
mother expecting to see them vanish at one mouthful

But Rob was a shrewd little man and got the better of her by eating
them one by one very slowly and enjoying every minute with all his
might

Hadnt you better tell the other story while you wait for him said
Demi anxious that no time should be lost

I really have nothing but a little tale about a woodbox said Mrs
Jo seeing that Rob had still seven corns to eat

Is there a boy in it

It is all boy

Is it true asked Demi

Every bit of it

Goody tell on please

James Snow and his mother lived in a little house up in New Hampshire
They were poor and James had to work to help his mother but he loved
books so well he hated work and just wanted to sit and study all day
long

How could he I hate books and like work said Dan objecting to
James at the very outset

It takes all sorts of people to make a world workers and students both
are needed and there is room for all But I think the workers should
study some and the students should know how to work if necessary
answered Mrs Jo looking from Dan to Demi with a significant
expression

Im sure I do work and Demi showed three small hard spots in his
little palm with pride

And Im sure I study added Dan nodding with a groan toward the
blackboard full of neat figures

See what James did He did not mean to be selfish but his mother was
proud of him and let him do as he liked working by herself that he
might have books and time to read them One autumn James wanted to go
to school and went to the minister to see if he would help him about
decent clothes and books Now the minister had heard the gossip about
Jamess idleness and was not inclined to do much for him thinking
that a boy who neglected his mother and let her slave for him was
not likely to do very well even at school But the good man felt more
interested when he found how earnest James was and being rather an odd
man he made this proposal to the boy to try now sincere he was

I will give you clothes and books on one condition James

What is that sir and the boy brightened up at once

You are to keep your mothers woodbox full all winter long and do
it yourself If you fail school stops James laughed at the queer
condition and readily agreed to it thinking it a very easy one

He began school and for a time got on capitally with the woodbox
for it was autumn and chips and brushwood were plentiful He ran out
morning and evening and got a basket full or chopped up the cat sticks
for the little cooking stove and as his mother was careful and saving
the task was not hard But in November the frost came the days were
dull and cold and wood went fast His mother bought a load with her own
earnings but it seemed to melt away and was nearly gone before James
remembered that he was to get the next Mrs Snow was feeble and lame
with rheumatism and unable to work as she had done so James had to put
down the books and see what he could do

It was hard for he was going on well and so interested in his
lessons that he hated to stop except for food and sleep But he knew the
minister would keep his word and much against his will James set about
earning money in his spare hours lest the woodbox should get empty
He did all sorts of things ran errands took care of a neighbors cow
helped the old sexton dust and warm the church on Sundays and in these
ways got enough to buy fuel in small quantities But it was hard work
the days were short the winter was bitterly cold and precious time
went fast and the dear books were so fascinating that it was sad to
leave them for dull duties that never seemed done

The minister watched him quietly and seeing that he was in earnest
helped him without his knowledge He met him often driving the wood
sleds from the forest where the men were chopping and as James plodded
beside the slow oxen he read or studied anxious to use every minute
The boy is worth helping this lesson will do him good and when he
has learned it I will give him an easier one said the minister
to himself and on Christmas eve a splendid load of wood was quietly
dropped at the door of the little house with a new saw and a bit of
paper saying only

The Lord helps those who help themselves

Poor James expected nothing but when he woke on that cold Christmas
morning he found a pair of warm mittens knit by his mother with her
stiff painful fingers This gift pleased him very much but her kiss
and tender look as she called him her good son was better still In
trying to keep her warm he had warmed his own heart you see and
in filling the woodbox he had also filled those months with duties
faithfully done He began to see this to feel that there was something
better than books and to try to learn the lessons God set him as well
as those his schoolmaster gave

When he saw the great pile of oak and pine logs at his door and read
the little paper he knew who sent it and understood the ministers
plan thanked him for it and fell to work with all his might Other
boys frolicked that day but James sawed wood and I think of all
the lads in the town the happiest was the one in the new mittens who
whistled like a blackbird as he filled his mothers woodbox

Thats a first rater cried Dan who enjoyed a simple matterofface
story better than the finest fairy tale I like that fellow after all

I could saw wood for you Aunt Jo said Demi feeling as if a new
means of earning money for his mother was suggested by the story

Tell about a bad boy I like them best said Nan

Youd better tell about a naughty crosspatch of a girl said Tommy
whose evening had been spoilt by Nans unkindness It made his apple
taste bitter his popcorn was insipid his nuts were hard to crack and
the sight of Ned and Nan on one bench made him feel his life a burden

But there were no more stories from Mrs Jo for on looking down at Rob
he was discovered to be fast asleep with his last corn firmly clasped in
his chubby hand Bundling him up in his coverlet his mother carried him
away and tucked him up with no fear of his popping out again

Now lets see who will come next said Emil setting the door
temptingly ajar

Mary Ann passed first and he called out to her but Silas had warned
her and she only laughed and hurried on in spite of their enticements
Presently a door opened and a strong voice was heard humming in the
hall

 Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten
 Dass ich so traurig bin

Its Uncle Fritz all laugh loud and he will be sure to come in said
Emil

A wild burst of laughter followed and in came Uncle Fritz asking
What is the joke my lads

Caught caught you cant go out till youve told a story cried the
boys slamming the door

So that is the joke then Well I have no wish to go it is so
pleasant here and I pay my forfeit at once which he did by sitting
down and beginning instantly

A long time ago your Grandfather Demi went to lecture in a great
town hoping to get some money for a home for little orphans that
some good people were getting up His lecture did well and he put a
considerable sum of money in his pocket feeling very happy about it As
he was driving in a chaise to another town he came to a lonely bit of
road late in the afternoon and was just thinking what a good place it
was for robbers when he saw a badlooking man come out of the woods
in front of him and go slowly along as if waiting till he came up The
thought of the money made Grandfather rather anxious and at first he
had a mind to turn round and drive away But the horse was tired and
then he did not like to suspect the man so he kept on and when he got
nearer and saw how poor and sick and ragged the stranger looked his
heart reproached him and stopping he said in a kind voice

My friend you look tired let me give you a lift The man seemed
surprised hesitated a minute and then got in He did not seem inclined
to talk but Grandfather kept on in his wise cheerful way speaking of
what a hard year it had been how much the poor had suffered and how
difficult it was to get on sometimes The man slowly softened a little
and won by the kind chat told his story How he had been sick could
get no work had a family of children and was almost in despair
Grandfather was so full of pity that he forgot his fear and asking the
man his name said he would try to get him work in the next town as he
had friends there Wishing to get at pencil and paper to write down the
address Grandfather took out his plump pocketbook and the minute he
did so the mans eye was on it Then Grandfather remembered what was in
it and trembled for his money but said quietly

Yes I have a little sum here for some poor orphans I wish it was my
own I would so gladly give you some of it I am not rich but I know
many of the trials of the poor this five dollars is mine and I want to
give it to you for your children

The hard hungry look in the mans eyes changed to a grateful one as he
took the small sum freely given and left the orphans money untouched
He rode on with Grandfather till they approached the town then he asked
to be set down Grandpa shook hands with him and was about to drive on
when the man said as if something made him I was desperate when we
met and I meant to rob you but you were so kind I couldnt do it God
bless you sir for keeping me from it

Did Grandpa ever see him again asked Daisy eagerly

No but I believe the man found work and did not try robbery any
more

That was a curious way to treat him Id have knocked him down said
Dan

Kindness is always better than force Try it and see answered Mr
Bhaer rising

Tell another please cried Daisy

You must Aunt Jo did added Demi

Then I certainly wont but keep my others for next time Too many
tales are as bad as too many bonbons I have paid my forfeit and I go
and Mr Bhaer ran for his life with the whole flock in full pursuit He
had the start however and escaped safely into his study leaving the
boys to go rioting back again

They were so stirred up by the race that they could not settle to their
former quiet and a lively game of Blindmans Buff followed in which
Tommy showed that he had taken the moral of the last story to heart
for when he caught Nan he whispered in her ear Im sorry I called
you a crosspatch

Nan was not to be outdone in kindness so when they played Button
button whos got the button and it was her turn to go round she
said Hold fast all I give you with such a friendly smile at Tommy
that he was not surprised to find the horsehair ring in his hand
instead of the button He only smiled back at her then but when they
were going to bed he offered Nan the best bite of his last apple she
saw the ring on his stumpy little finger accepted the bite and peace
was declared Both were ashamed of the temporary coldness neither was
ashamed to say I was wrong forgive me so the childish friendship
remained unbroken and the home in the willow lasted long a pleasant
little castle in the air



CHAPTER XXI THANKSGIVING

This yearly festival was always kept at Plumfield in the good
oldfashioned way and nothing was allowed to interfere with it For
days beforehand the little girls helped Asia and Mrs Jo in storeroom
and kitchen making pies and puddings sorting fruit dusting dishes
and being very busy and immensely important The boys hovered on the
outskirts of the forbidden ground sniffing the savory odors peeping
in at the mysterious performances and occasionally being permitted to
taste some delicacy in the process of preparation

Something more than usual seemed to be on foot this year for the girls
were as busy upstairs as down so were the boys in schoolroom and
barn and a general air of bustle pervaded the house There was a great
hunting up of old ribbons and finery much cutting and pasting of gold
paper and the most remarkable quantity of straw gray cotton flannel
and big black beads used by Franz and Mrs Jo Ned hammered at strange
machines in the workshop Demi and Tommy went about murmuring to
themselves as if learning something A fearful racket was heard in
Emils room at intervals and peals of laughter from the nursery when
Rob and Teddy were sent for and hidden from sight whole hours at a time
But the thing that puzzled Mr Bhaer the most was what became of Robs
big pumpkin It had been borne in triumph to the kitchen where a dozen
goldentinted pies soon after appeared It would not have taken more
than a quarter of the mammoth vegetable to make them yet where was the
rest It disappeared and Rob never seemed to care only chuckled when
it was mentioned and told his father To wait and see for the fun of
the whole thing was to surprise Father Bhaer at the end and not let him
know a bit about what was to happen

He obediently shut eyes ears and mouth and went about trying not
to see what was in plain sight not to hear the telltale sounds that
filled the air not to understand any of the perfectly transparent
mysteries going on all about him Being a German he loved these simple
domestic festivals and encouraged them with all his heart for they
made home so pleasant that the boys did not care to go elsewhere for
fun

When at last the day came the boys went off for a long walk that they
might have good appetites for dinner as if they ever needed them The
girls remained at home to help set the table and give last touches to
various affairs which filled their busy little souls with anxiety The
schoolroom had been shut up since the night before and Mr Bhaer was
forbidden to enter it on pain of a beating from Teddy who guarded the
door like a small dragon though he was dying to tell about it and
nothing but his fathers heroic selfdenial in not listening kept him
from betraying a grand secret

Its all done and its perfectly splendid cried Nan coming out at
last with an air of triumph

The you know goes beautifully and Silas knows just what to do now
added Daisy skipping with delight at some unspeakable success

Im blest if it aint the cutest thing I ever see them critters in
particular said Silas who had been let into the secret went off
laughing like a great boy

They are coming I hear Emil roaring Land lubbers lying down below
so we must run and dress cried Nan and upstairs they scampered in a
great hurry

The boys came trooping home with appetites that would have made the big
turkey tremble if it had not been past all fear They also retired to
dress and for halfanhour there was a washing brushing and prinking
that would have done any tidy womans heart good to see When the bell
rang a troop of freshfaced lads with shiny hair clean collars and
Sunday jackets on filed into the diningroom where Mrs Jo in her
one black silk with a knot of her favorite white chrysanthemums in her
bosom sat at the head of the table looking splendid as the boys
said whenever she got herself up Daisy and Nan were as gay as a posy
bed in their new winter dresses with bright sashes and hair ribbons
Teddy was gorgeous to behold in a crimson merino blouse and his best
button boots which absorbed and distracted him as much as Mr Toots
wristbands did on one occasion

As Mr and Mrs Bhaer glanced at each other down the long table with
those rows of happy faces on either side they had a little thanksgiving
all to themselves and without a word for one heart said to the other

Our work has prospered let us be grateful and go on

The clatter of knives and forks prevented much conversation for a few
minutes and Mary Ann with an amazing pink bow in her hair flew round
briskly handing plates and ladling out gravy Nearly every one had
contributed to the feast so the dinner was a peculiarly interesting
ones to the eaters of it who beguiled the pauses by remarks on their
own productions

If these are not good potatoes I never saw any observed Jack as he
received his fourth big mealy one

Some of my herbs are in the stuffing of the turkey thats why its so
nice said Nan taking a mouthful with intense satisfaction

My ducks are prime any way Asia said she never cooked such fat ones
added Tommy

Well our carrots are beautiful aint they and our parsnips will
be ever so good when we dig them put in Dick and Dolly murmured his
assent from behind the bone he was picking

I helped make the pies with my pumpkin called out Robby with a laugh
which he stopped by retiring into his mug

I picked some of the apples that the cider is made of said Demi

I raked the cranberries for the sauce cried Nat

I got the nuts added Dan and so it went on all round the table

Who made up Thanksgiving asked Rob for being lately promoted to
jacket and trousers he felt a new and manly interest in the institutions
of his country

See who can answer that question and Mr Bhaer nodded to one or two
of his best history boys

I know said Demi the Pilgrims made it

What for asked Rob without waiting to learn who the Pilgrims were

I forget and Demi subsided

I believe it was because they were starved once and so when they had a
good harvest they said We will thank God for it and they had a day
and called it Thanksgiving said Dan who liked the story of the brave
men who suffered so nobly for their faith

Good I didnt think you would remember any thing but natural history
and Mr Bhaer tapped gently on the table as applause for his pupil

Dan looked pleased and Mrs Jo said to her son Now do you understand
about it Robby

No I dont I thought pilgrins were a sort of big bird that lived on
rocks and I saw pictures of them in Demis book

He means penguins Oh isnt he a little goosey and Demi laid back in
his chair and laughed aloud

Dont laugh at him but tell him all about it if you can said Mrs
Bhaer consoling Rob with more cranberry sauce for the general smile
that went round the table at his mistake

Well I will and after a pause to collect his ideas Demi delivered
the following sketch of the Pilgrim Fathers which would have made even
those grave gentlemen smile if they could have heard it

You see Rob some of the people in England didnt like the king or
something so they got into ships and sailed away to this country It
was all full of Indians and bears and wild creatures and they lived
in forts and had a dreadful time

The bears asked Robby with interest

No the Pilgrims because the Indians troubled them They hadnt enough
to eat and they went to church with guns and ever so many died and
they got out of the ships on a rock and its called Plymouth Rock and
Aunt Jo saw it and touched it The Pilgrims killed all the Indians
and got rich and hung the witches and were very good and some of the
greatest greatgrandpas came in the ships One was the Mayflower and
they made Thanksgiving and we have it always and I like it Some more
turkey please

I think Demi will be an historian there is such order and clearness in
his account of events and Uncle Fritzs eyes laughed at Aunt Jo as he
helped the descendant of the Pilgrims to his third bit of turkey

I thought you must eat as much as ever you could on Thanksgiving
But Franz says you mustnt even then and Stuffy looked as if he had
received bad news

Franz is right so mind your knife and fork and be moderate or else
you wont be able to help in the surprise by and by said Mrs Jo

Ill be careful but everybody does eat lots and I like it better
than being moderate said Stuffy who leaned to the popular belief that
Thanksgiving must be kept by coming as near apoplexy as possible and
escaping with merely a fit of indigestion or a headache

Now my pilgrims amuse yourselves quietly till teatime for you will
have enough excitement this evening said Mrs Jo as they rose from
the table after a protracted sitting finished by drinking every ones
health in cider

I think I will take the whole flock for a drive it is so pleasant
then you can rest my dear or you will be worn out this evening added
Mr Bhaer and as soon as coats and hats could be put on the great
omnibus was packed full and away they went for a long gay drive
leaving Mrs Jo to rest and finish sundry small affairs in peace

An early and light tea was followed by more brushing of hair and washing
of hands then the flock waited impatiently for the company to come
Only the family was expected for these small revels were strictly
domestic and such being the case sorrow was not allowed to sadden the
present festival All came Mr and Mrs March with Aunt Meg so sweet
and lovely in spite of her black dress and the little widows cap that
encircled her tranquil face Uncle Teddy and Aunt Amy with the Princess
looking more fairylike than ever in a skyblue gown and a great
bouquet of hothouse flowers which she divided among the boys sticking
one in each buttonhole making them feel peculiarly elegant and
festive One strange face appeared and Uncle Teddy led the unknown
gentleman up to the Bhaers saying

This is Mr Hyde he has been inquiring about Dan and I ventured to
bring him tonight that he might see how much the boy has improved

The Bhaers received him cordially for Dans sake pleased that the lad
had been remembered But after a few minutes chat they were glad to
know Mr Hyde for his own sake so genial simple and interesting was
he It was pleasant to see the boys face light up when he caught
sight of his friend pleasanter still to see Mr Hydes surprise and
satisfaction in Dans improved manners and appearance and pleasantest
of all to watch the two sit talking in a corner forgetting the
differences of age culture and position in the one subject which
interested both as man and boy compared notes and told the story of
their summer life

The performance must begin soon or the actors will go to sleep said
Mrs Jo when the first greetings were over

So every one went into the schoolroom and took seats before a curtain
made of two bedcovers The children had already vanished but stifled
laughter and funny little exclamations from behind the curtain
betrayed their whereabouts The entertainment began with a spirited
exhibition of gymnastics led by Franz The six elder lads in blue
trousers and red shirts made a fine display of muscle with dumbbells
clubs and weights keeping time to the music of the piano played by
Mrs Jo behind the scenes Dan was so energetic in this exercise that
there was some danger of his knocking down his neighbors like so many
ninepins or sending his beanbags whizzing among the audience for he
was excited by Mr Hydes presence and a burning desire to do honor to
his teachers

A fine strong lad If I go on my trip to South America in a year or
two I shall be tempted to ask you to lend him to me Mr Bhaer said
Mr Hyde whose interest in Dan was much increased by the report he had
just heard of him

You shall have him and welcome though we shall miss our young
Hercules very much It would do him a world of good and I am sure he
would serve his friend faithfully

Dan heard both question and answer and his heart leaped with joy at the
thought of travelling in a new country with Mr Hyde and swelled with
gratitude for the kindly commendation which rewarded his efforts to be
all these friends desired to see him

After the gymnastics Demi and Tommy spoke the old school dialogue
Money makes the mare go Demi did very well but Tommy was capital
as the old farmer for he imitated Silas in a way that convulsed the
audience and caused Silas himself to laugh so hard that Asia had
to slap him on the back as they stood in the hall enjoying the fun
immensely

Then Emil who had got his breath by this time gave them a seasong
in costume with a great deal about stormy winds lee shores and
a rousing chorus of Luff boys luff which made the room ring after
which Ned performed a funny Chinese dance and hopped about like a large
frog in a pagoda hat As this was the only public exhibition ever held
at Plumfield a few exercises in lightningarithmetic spelling
and reading were given Jack quite amazed the public by his rapid
calculations on the blackboard Tommy won in the spelling match and
Demi read a little French fable so well that Uncle Teddy was charmed

Where are the other children asked every one as the curtain fell and
none of the little ones appeared

Oh that is the surprise Its so lovely I pity you because you dont
know it said Demi who had gone to get his mothers kiss and stayed
by her to explain the mystery when it should be revealed

Goldilocks had been carried off by Aunt Jo to the great amazement of
her papa who quite outdid Mr Bhaer in acting wonder suspense and
wild impatience to know what was going to happen

At last after much rustling hammering and very audible directions
from the stage manager the curtain rose to soft music and Bess was
discovered sitting on a stool beside a brown paper fireplace A dearer
little Cinderella was never seen for the gray gown was very ragged the
tiny shoes all worn the face so pretty under the bright hair and the
attitude so dejected it brought tears as well as smiles to the fond
eyes looking at the baby actress She sat quite still till a voice
whispered Now then she sighed a funny little sigh and said Oh
I wish I tood go to the ball so naturally that her father clapped
frantically and her mother called out Little darling These highly
improper expressions of feeling caused Cinderella to forget herself and
shake her head at them saying reprovingly You mustnt peak to me

Silence instantly prevailed and three taps were heard on the wall
Cinderella looked alarmed but before she could remember to say What
is dat the back of the brown paper fireplace opened like a door and
with some difficulty the fairy godmother got herself and her pointed
hat through It was Nan in a red cloak a cap and a wand which she
waved as she said decidedly

You shall go to the ball my dear

Now you must pull and show my pretty dress returned Cinderella
tugging at her brown gown

No no you must say How can I go in my rags said the godmother in
her own voice

Oh yes so I mus and the Princess said it quite undisturbed by her
forgetfulness

I change your rags into a splendid dress because you are good said
the godmother in her stage tones and deliberately unbuttoning the brown
pinafore she displayed a gorgeous sight

The little Princess really was pretty enough to turn the heads of any
number of small princes for her mamma had dressed her like a tiny court
lady in a rosy silk train with satin underskirt and bits of bouquets
here and there quite lovely to behold The godmother put a crown with
pink and white feathers drooping from it on her head and gave her
a pair of silver paper slippers which she put on and then stood up
lifting her skirts to show them to the audience saying with pride My
dlass ones aint they pitty

She was so charmed with them that she was with difficulty recalled to
her part and made to say

But I have no toach Dodmother

Behold it and Nan waved her wand with such a flourish that she
nearly knocked off the crown of the Princess

Then appeared the grand triumph of the piece First a rope was seen to
flap on the floor to tighten with a twitch as Emils voice was heard
to say Heave ahoy and Silass gruff one to reply Stiddy
now stiddy A shout of laughter followed for four large gray rats
appeared rather shaky as to their legs and queer as to their tails
but quite fine about the head where black beads shone in the most
lifelike manner They drew or were intended to appear as if they did
a magnificent coach made of half the mammoth pumpkin mounted on the
wheels of Teddys wagon painted yellow to match the gay carriage
Perched on a seat in front sat a jolly little coachman in a white
cottonwool wig cocked hat scarlet breeches and laced coat who
cracked a long whip and jerked the red reins so energetically that the
gray steeds reared finely It was Teddy and he beamed upon the company
so affably that they gave him a round all to himself and Uncle Laurie
said If I could find as sober a coachman as that one I would engage
him on the spot The coach stopped the godmother lifted in the
Princess and she was trundled away in state kissing her hand to the
public with her glass shoes sticking up in front and her pink train
sweeping the ground behind for elegant as the coach was I regret to
say that her Highness was rather a tight fit

The next scene was the ball and here Nan and Daisy appeared as gay as
peacocks in all sorts of finery Nan was especially good as the proud
sister and crushed many imaginary ladies as she swept about the
palacehall The Prince in solitary state upon a somewhat unsteady
throne sat gazing about him from under an imposing crown as he played
with his sword and admired the rosettes in his shoes When Cinderella
came in he jumped up and exclaimed with more warmth than elegance

My gracious who is that and immediately led the lady out to dance
while the sisters scowled and turned up their noses in the corner

The stately jig executed by the little couple was very pretty for the
childish faces were so earnest the costumes so gay and the steps so
peculiar that they looked like the dainty quaint figures painted on
a Watteau fan The Princesss train was very much in her way and
the sword of Prince Rob nearly tripped him up several times But they
overcame these obstacles remarkably well and finished the dance with
much grace and spirit considering that neither knew what the other was
about

Drop your shoe whispered Mrs Jos voice as the lady was about to sit
down

Oh I fordot and taking off one of the silvery slippers Cinderella
planted it carefully in the middle of the stage said to Rob Now you
must try and tatch me and ran away while the Prince picking up the
shoe obediently trotted after her

The third scene as everybody knows is where the herald comes to try
on the shoe Teddy still in coachmans dress came in blowing a tin
fishhorn melodiously and the proud sisters each tried to put on the
slipper Nan insisted on playing cut off her toe with a carvingknife
and performed that operation so well that the herald was alarmed and
begged her to be welly keerful Cinderella then was called and came
in with the pinafore half on slipped her foot into the slipper and
announced with satisfaction

I am the Pinsiss

Daisy wept and begged pardon but Nan who liked tragedy improved upon
the story and fell in a faintingfit upon the floor where she remained
comfortably enjoying the rest of the play It was not long for the
Prince ran in dropped upon his knees and kissed the hand of Goldilocks
with great ardor while the herald blew a blast that nearly deafened the
audience The curtain had no chance to fall for the Princess ran off
the stage to her father crying Didnt I do well while the Prince
and herald had a fencingmatch with the tin horn and wooden sword

It was beautiful said every one and when the raptures had a little
subsided Nat came out with his violin in his hand

Hush hush cried all the children and silence followed for
something in the boys bashful manner and appealing eyes make every one
listen kindly

The Bhaers thought he would play some of the old airs he knew so well
but to their surprise they heard a new and lovely melody so softly
sweetly played that they could hardly believe it could be Nat It was
one of those songs without words that touch the heart and sing of all
tender homelike hopes and joys soothing and cheering those who listen
to its simple music Aunt Meg leaned her head on Demis shoulder
Grandmother wiped her eyes and Mrs Jo looked up at Mr Laurie saying
in a choky whisper

You composed that

I wanted your boy to do you honor and thank you in his own way
answered Laurie leaning down to answer her

When Nat made his bow and was about to go he was called back by many
hands and had to play again He did so with such a happy face that
it was good to see him for he did his best and gave them the gay old
tunes that set the feet to dancing and made quietude impossible

Clear the floor cried Emil and in a minute the chairs were pushed
back the older people put safely in corners and the children gathered
on the stage

Show your manners called Emil and the boys pranced up to the ladies
old and young with polite invitations to tread the mazy as dear Dick
Swiveller has it The small lads nearly came to blows for the Princess
but she chose Dick like a kind little gentlewoman as she was and let
him lead her proudly to her place Mrs Jo was not allowed to decline
and Aunt Amy filled Dan with unspeakable delight by refusing Franz and
taking him Of course Nan and Tommy Nat and Daisy paired off while
Uncle Teddy went and got Asia who was longing to jig it and felt
much elated by the honor done her Silas and Mary Ann had a private
dance in the hall and for halfanhour Plumfield was at its merriest

The party wound up with a grand promenade of all the young folks headed
by the pumpkincoach with the Princess and driver inside and the rats
in a wildly frisky state

While the children enjoyed this final frolic the elders sat in the
parlor looking on as they talked together of the little people with the
interest of parents and friends

What are you thinking of all by yourself with such a happy face
sister Jo asked Laurie sitting down beside her on the sofa

My summers work Teddy and amusing myself by imagining the future of
my boys she answered smiling as she made room for him

They are all to be poets painters and statesmen famous soldiers or
at least merchant princes I suppose

No I am not as aspiring as I once was and I shall be satisfied if
they are honest men But I will confess that I do expect a little glory
and a career for some of them Demi is not a common child and I think
he will blossom into something good and great in the best sense of the
word The others will do well I hope especially my last two boys for
after hearing Nat play tonight I really think he has genius

Too soon to say talent he certainly has and there is no doubt that
the boy can soon earn his bread by the work he loves Build him up for
another year or so and then I will take him off your hands and launch
him properly

That is such a pleasant prospect for poor Nat who came to me six
months ago so friendless and forlorn Dans future is already plain
to me Mr Hyde will want him soon and I mean to give him a brave and
faithful little servant Dan is one who can serve well if the wages are
love and confidence and he has the energy to carve out his own future
in his own way Yes I am very happy over our success with these boys
one so weak and one so wild both so much better now and so full of
promise

What magic did you use Jo

I only loved them and let them see it Fritz did the rest

Dear soul you look as if only loving had been rather hard work
sometimes said Laurie stroking her thin cheek with a look of more
tender admiration than he had ever given her as a girl

Im a faded old woman but Im a very happy one so dont pity me
Teddy and she glanced about the room with eyes full of a sincere
content

Yes your plan seems to work better and better every year he said
with an emphatic nod of approval toward the cheery scene before him

How can it fail to work well when I have so much help from you all
answered Mrs Jo looking gratefully at her most generous patron

It is the best joke of the family this school of yours and its
success So unlike the future we planned for you and yet so suited to
you after all It was a regular inspiration Jo said Laurie dodging
her thanks as usual

Ah but you laughed at it in the beginning and still make all manner
of fun of me and my inspirations Didnt you predict that having girls
with the boys would be a dead failure Now see how well it works and
she pointed to the happy group of lads and lassies dancing singing and
chattering together with every sign of kindly good fellowship

I give in and when my Goldilocks is old enough Ill send her to you
Can I say more than that

I shall be so proud to have your little treasure trusted to me But
really Teddy the effect of these girls has been excellent I know you
will laugh at me but I dont mind Im used to it so Ill tell you
that one of my favorite fancies is to look at my family as a small
world to watch the progress of my little men and lately to see how
well the influence of my little women works upon them Daisy is the
domestic element and they all feel the charm of her quiet womanly
ways Nan is the restless energetic strongminded one they admire her
courage and give her a fair chance to work out her will seeing that
she has sympathy as well as strength and the power to do much in their
small world Your Bess is the lady full of natural refinement grace
and beauty She polishes them unconsciously and fills her place as any
lovely woman may using her gentle influence to lift and hold them above
the coarse rough things of life and keep them gentlemen in the best
sense of the fine old word

It is not always the ladies who do that best Jo It is sometimes the
strong brave woman who stirs up the boy and makes a man of him and
Laurie bowed to her with a significant laugh

No I think the graceful woman whom the boy you allude to married has
done more for him than the wild Nan of his youth or better still the
wise motherly woman who watched over him as Daisy watches over Demi
did more to make him what he is and Jo turned toward her mother who
sat a little apart with Meg looking so full of the sweet dignity and
beauty of old age that Laurie gave her a glance of filial respect and
love as he replied in serious earnest

All three did much for him and I can understand how well these little
girls will help your lads

Not more than the lads help them it is mutual I assure you Nat does
much for Daisy with his music Dan can manage Nan better than any of
us and Demi teaches your Goldilocks so easily and well that Fritz calls
them Roger Ascham and Lady Jane Grey Dear me if men and women would
only trust understand and help one another as my children do what a
capital place the world would be and Mrs Jos eyes grew absent as if
she was looking at a new and charming state of society in which people
lived as happily and innocently as her flock at Plumfield

You are doing your best to help on the good time my dear Continue
to believe in it to work for it and to prove its possibility by the
success of her small experiment said Mr March pausing as he passed
to say an encouraging word for the good man never lost his faith in
humanity and still hoped to see peace goodwill and happiness reign
upon the earth

I am not so ambitious as that father I only want to give these
children a home in which they can be taught a few simple things which
will help to make life less hard to them when they go out to fight their
battles in the world Honesty courage industry faith in God their
fellowcreatures and themselves that is all I try for

That is every thing Give them these helps then let them go to work
out their life as men and women and whatever their success or failure
is I think they will remember and bless your efforts my good son and
daughter

The Professor had joined them and as Mr March spoke he gave a hand
to each and left them with a look that was a blessing As Jo and her
husband stood together for a moment talking quietly and feeling that
their summer work had been well done if father approved Mr Laurie
slipped into the hall said a word to the children and all of a sudden
the whole flock pranced into the room joined hands and danced about
Father and Mother Bhaer singing blithely

 Summer days are over
 Summer work is done
 Harvests have been gathered
 Gayly one by one
 Now the feast is eaten
 Finished is the play
 But one rite remains for
 Our Thanksgivingday
 Best of all the harvest
 In the dear Gods sight
 Are the happy children
 In the home tonight
 And we come to offer
 Thanks where thanks are due
 With grateful hearts and voices
 Father mother unto you

With the last words the circle narrowed till the good Professor and his
wife were taken prisoner by many arms and half hidden by the bouquet of
laughing young faces which surrounded them proving that one plant had
taken root and blossomed beautifully in all the little gardens For love
is a flower that grows in any soil works its sweet miracles undaunted
by autumn frost or winter snow blooming fair and fragrant all the year
and blessing those who give and those who receive

Section 2 Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergtm

Project Gutenbergtm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete old middleaged and new computers It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergtm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
