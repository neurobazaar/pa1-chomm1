STUDY OF A WOMAN


The Marquise de Listomere is one of those young women who have been
brought up in the spirit of the Restoration She has principles she
fasts takes the sacrament and goes to balls and operas very elegantly
dressed her confessor permits her to combine the mundane with sanctity
Always in conformity with the Church and with the world she presents
a living image of the present day which seems to have taken the word
legality for its motto The conduct of the marquise shows precisely
enough religious devotion to attain under a new Maintenon to the gloomy
piety of the last days of Louis XIV and enough worldliness to adopt
the habits of gallantry of the first years of that reign should it ever
be revived At the present moment she is strictly virtuous from policy
possibly from inclination Married for the last seven years to the
Marquis de Listomere one of those deputies who expect a peerage she
may also consider that such conduct will promote the ambitions of her
family Some women are reserving their opinion of her until the moment
when Monsieur de Listomere becomes a peer of France when she herself
will be thirtysix years of agea period of life when most women
discover that they are the dupes of social laws

The marquis is a rather insignificant man He stands well at court his
good qualities are as negative as his defects the former can no more
make him a reputation for virtue than the latter can give him the sort
of glamor cast by vice As deputy he never speaks but he votes RIGHT
He behaves in his own home as he does in the Chamber Consequently he
is held to be one of the best husbands in France Though not susceptible
of lively interest he never scolds unless to be sure he is kept
waiting His friends have named him dull weatheraptly enough for
there is neither clear light nor total darkness about him He is like
all the ministers who have succeeded one another in France since the
Charter A woman with principles could not have fallen into better
hands It is certainly a great thing for a virtuous woman to have
married a man incapable of follies

Occasionally some fops have been sufficiently impertinent to press the
hand of the marquise while dancing with her They gained nothing in
return but contemptuous glances all were made to feel the shock of that
insulting indifference which like a spring frost destroys the germs of
flattering hopes Beaux wits and fops men whose sentiments are fed
by sucking their canes those of a great name or a great fame those of
the highest or the lowest rank in her own world they all blanch before
her She has conquered the right to converse as long and as often as she
chooses with the men who seem to her agreeable without being entered on
the tablets of gossip Certain coquettish women are capable of following
a plan of this kind for seven years in order to gratify their fancies
later but to suppose any such reservations in the Marquise de Listomere
would be to calumniate her

I have had the happiness of knowing this phoenix She talks well I know
how to listen consequently I please her and I go to her parties That
in fact was the object of my ambition

Neither plain nor pretty Madame de Listomere has white teeth a
dazzling skin and very red lips she is tall and wellmade her foot
is small and slender and she does not put it forth her eyes far from
being dulled like those of so many Parisian women have a gentle glow
which becomes quite magical if by chance she is animated A soul
is then divined behind that rather indefinite form If she takes an
interest in the conversation she displays a grace which is otherwise
buried beneath the precautions of cold demeanor and then she is
charming She does not seek success but she obtains it We find that
for which we do not seek that saying is so often true that some day
it will be turned into a proverb It is in fact the moral of this
adventure which I should not allow myself to tell if it were not
echoing at the present moment through all the salons of Paris

The Marquise de Listomere danced about a month ago with a young man as
modest as he is lively full of good qualities but exhibiting chiefly
his defects He is ardent but he laughs at ardor he has talent and he
hides it he plays the learned man with aristocrats and the aristocrat
with learned men Eugene de Rastignac is one of those extremely clever
young men who try all things and seem to sound others to discover what
the future has in store While awaiting the age of ambition he scoffs
at everything he has grace and originality two rare qualities because
the one is apt to exclude the other On this occasion he talked for
nearly half an hour with madame de Listomere without any predetermined
idea of pleasing her As they followed the caprices of conversation
which beginning with the opera of Guillaume Tell had reached the
topic of the duties of women he looked at the marquise more than once
in a manner that embarrassed her then he left her and did not speak to
her again for the rest of the evening He danced played at ecarte lost
some money and went home to bed I have the honor to assure you that
the affair happened precisely thus I add nothing and I suppress
nothing

The next morning Rastignac woke late and stayed in bed giving himself
up to one of those matutinal reveries in the course of which a young man
glides like a sylph under many a silken or cashmere or cotton drapery
The heavier the body from its weight of sleep the more active the mind
Rastignac finally got up without yawning overmuch as many illbred
persons are apt to do He rang for his valet ordered tea and drank
immoderately of it when it came which will not seem extraordinary to
persons who like tea but to explain the circumstance to others who
regard that beverage as a panacea for indigestion I will add that
Eugene was by this time writing letters He was comfortably seated
with his feet more frequently on the andirons than properly on the
rug Ah to have ones feet on the polished bar which connects the two
griffins of a fender and to think of our love in our dressinggown is
so delightful a thing that I deeply regret the fact of having neither
mistress nor fender nor dressinggown

The first letter which Eugene wrote was soon finished he folded and
sealed it and laid it before him without adding the address The second
letter begun at eleven oclock was not finished till midday The four
pages were closely filled

That woman keeps running in my head he muttered as he folded this
second epistle and laid it before him intending to direct it as soon as
he had ended his involuntary revery

He crossed the two flaps of his flowered dressinggown put his feet
on a stool slipped his hands into the pockets of his red cashmere
trousers and lay back in a delightful easychair with side wings the
seat and back of which described an angle of one hundred and twenty
degrees He stopped drinking tea and remained motionless his eyes fixed
on the gilded hand which formed the knob of his shovel but without
seeing either hand or shovel He ceased even to poke the firea vast
mistake Isnt it one of our greatest pleasures to play with the fire
when we think of women Our minds find speeches in those tiny blue
flames which suddenly dart up and babble on the hearth We interpret as
we please the strong harsh tones of a burgundian

Here I must pause to put before all ignorant persons an explanation of
that word derived from a very distinguished etymologist who wishes his
name kept secret

Burgundian is the name given since the reign of Charles VI to those
noisy detonations the result of which is to fling upon the carpet
or the clothes a little coal or ember the trifling nucleus of a
conflagration Heat or fire releases they say a bubble of air left in
the heart of the wood by a gnawing worm Inde amor inde burgundus
We tremble when we see the structure we had so carefully erected between
the logs rolling down like an avalanche Oh to build and stir and play
with fire when we love is the material development of our thoughts

It was at this moment that I entered the room Rastignac gave a jump and
said

Ah there you are dear Horace how long have you been here

Just come

Ah

He took up the two letters directed them and rang for his servant

Take these he said and deliver them

Joseph departed without a word admirable servant

We began to talk of the expedition to Morea to which I was anxious to
be appointed as physician Eugene remarked that I should lose a great
deal of time if I left Paris We then conversed on various matters and
I think you will be glad if I suppress the conversation

When the Marquise de Listomere rose about halfpast two in the
afternoon of that day her waitingmaid Caroline gave her a letter
which she read while Caroline was doing her hair an imprudence which
many young women are thoughtless enough to commit

Dear angel of love said the letter treasure of my life and
happiness

At these words the marquise was about to fling the letter in the fire
but there came into her head a fancywhich all virtuous women will
readily understandto see how a man who began a letter in that style
could possibly end it When she had turned the fourth page and read it
she let her arms drop like a person much fatigued

Caroline go and ask who left this letter

Madame I received it myself from the valet of Monsieur le Baron de
Rastignac

After that there was silence for some time

Does Madame intend to dress asked Caroline at last

NoHe is certainly a most impertinent man reflected the marquise

I request all women to imagine for themselves the reflections of which
this was the first

Madame de Listomere ended hers by a formal decision to forbid her porter
to admit Monsieur de Rastignac and to show him herself something
more than disdain when she met him in society for his insolence far
surpassed that of other men which the marquise had ended by overlooking
At first she thought of keeping the letter but on second thoughts she
burned it

Madame had just received such a fine loveletter and she read it
said Caroline to the housemaid

I should never have thought that of madame replied the other quite
surprised

That evening Madame de Listomere went to a party at the Marquis de
Beauseants where Rastignac would probably betake himself It was
Saturday The Marquis de Beauseant was in some way a connection of
Monsieur de Rastignac and the young man was not likely to miss coming
By two in the morning Madame de Listomere who had gone there solely for
the purpose of crushing Eugene by her coldness discovered that she was
waiting in vain A brilliant manStendhalhas given the fantastic name
of crystallization to the process which Madame de Listomeres thoughts
went through before during and after this evening

Four days later Eugene was scolding his valet

Ah ca Joseph I shall soon have to send you away my lad

What is it monsieur

You do nothing but make mistakes Where did you carry those letters I
gave you Saturday

Joseph became stolid Like a statue in some cathedral porch he stood
motionless entirely absorbed in the labors of imagination Suddenly he
smiled idiotically and said

Monsieur one was for the Marquise de Listomere the other was for
Monsieurs lawyer

You are certain of what you say

Joseph was speechless I saw plainly that I must interfere as I
happened to be again in Eugenes apartment

Joseph is right I said

Eugene turned and looked at me

I read the addresses quite involuntarily and

And interrupted Eugene one of them was _not_ for Madame de
Nucingen

No by all the devils it was not Consequently I supposed my dear
fellow that your heart was wandering from the rue SaintLazare to the
rue SaintDominique

Eugene struck his forehead with the flat of his hand and began to laugh
by which Joseph perceived that the blame was not on him

Now there are certain morals to this tale on which young men had better
reflect _First mistake_ Eugene thought it would be amusing to
make Madame de Listomere laugh at the blunder which had made her the
recipient of a loveletter which was not intended for her _Second
mistake_ he did not call on Madame de Listomere for several days after
the adventure thus allowing the thoughts of that virtuous young woman
to crystallize There were other mistakes which I will here pass over in
silence in order to give the ladies the pleasure of deducing them ex
professo to those who are unable to guess them

Eugene at last went to call upon the marquise but on attempting to
pass into the house the porter stopped him saying that Madame la
marquise was out As he was getting back into his carriage the Marquis
de Listomere came home

Come in Eugene he said My wife is at home

Pray excuse the marquis A husband however good he may be never
attains perfection As they went up the staircase Rastignac perceived
at least a dozen blunders in worldly wisdom which had unaccountably
slipped into this page of the glorious book of his life

When Madame de Listomere saw her husband ushering in Eugene she could
not help blushing The young baron saw that sudden color If the most
humbleminded man retains in the depths of his soul a certain conceit of
which he never rids himself any more than a woman ever rids herself of
coquetry who shall blame Eugene if he did say softly in his own mind
What that fortress too So thinking he posed in his cravat
Young men may not be grasping but they like to get a new coin in their
collection

Monsieur de Listomere seized the Gazette de France which he saw on
the mantelpiece and carried it to a window to obtain by journalistic
help an opinion of his own on the state of France

A woman even a prude is never long embarrassed however difficult may
be the position in which she finds herself she seems always to have on
hand the figleaf which our mother Eve bequeathed to her Consequently
when Eugene interpreting in favor of his vanity the refusal to admit
him bowed to Madame de Listomere in a tolerably intentional manner she
veiled her thoughts behind one of those feminine smiles which are more
impenetrable than the words of a king

Are you unwell madame You denied yourself to visitors

I am well monsieur

Perhaps you were going out

Not at all

You expected some one

No one

If my visit is indiscreet you must blame Monsieur le marquis I had
already accepted your mysterious denial when he himself came up and
introduced me into the sanctuary

Monsieur de Listomere is not in my confidence on this point It is not
always prudent to put a husband in possession of certain secrets

The firm and gentle tones in which the marquise said these words and
the imposing glance which she cast upon Rastignac made him aware that he
had posed in his cravat a trifle prematurely

Madame I understand you he said laughing I ought therefore to
be doubly thankful that Monsieur le marquis met me he affords me an
opportunity to offer you excuses which might be full of danger were you
not kindness itself

The marquise looked at the young man with an air of some surprise but
she answered with dignity

Monsieur silence on your part will be the best excuse As for me
I promise you entire forgetfulness and the pardon which you scarcely
deserve

Madame said Rastignac hastily pardon is not needed where there was
no offence The letter he added in a low voice which you received
and which you must have thought extremely unbecoming was not intended
for you

The marquise could not help smiling though she wished to seem offended

Why deceive she said with a disdainful air although the tones of
her voice were gentle Now that I have duly scolded you I am willing
to laugh at a subterfuge which is not without cleverness I know many
women who would be taken in by it Heavens how he loves me they
would say

Here the marquise gave a forced laugh and then added in a tone of
indulgence

If we desire to continue friends let there be no more _mistakes_ of
which it is impossible that I should be the dupe

Upon my honor madame you are sofar more than you think replied
Eugene

What are you talking about asked Monsieur de Listomere who for
the last minute had been listening to the conversation the meaning of
which he could not penetrate

Oh nothing that would interest you replied his wife

Monsieur de Listomere tranquilly returned to the reading of his paper
and presently said

Ah Madame de Mortsauf is dead your poor brother has no doubt gone
to Clochegourde

Are you aware monsieur resumed the marquise turning to Eugene
that what you have just said is a great impertinence

If I did not know the strictness of your principles he answered
naively I should think that you wished either to give me ideas which I
deny myself or else to tear a secret from me But perhaps you are only
amusing yourself with me

The marquise smiled That smile annoyed Eugene

Madame he said can you still believe in an offence I have not
committed I earnestly hope that chance may not enable you to discover
the name of the person who ought to have read that letter

What can it be _still_ Madame de Nucingen cried Madame de Listomere
more eager to penetrate that secret than to revenge herself for the
impertinence of the young mans speeches

Eugene colored A man must be more than twentyfive years of age not
to blush at being taxed with a fidelity that women laugh atin order
perhaps not to show that they envy it However he replied with
tolerable selfpossession

Why not madame

Such are the blunders we all make at twentyfive

This speech caused a violent commotion in Madame de Listomeres bosom
but Rastignac did not yet know how to analyze a womans face by a rapid
or sidelong glance The lips of the marquise paled but that was all
She rang the bell for wood and so constrained Rastignac to rise and
take his leave

If that be so said the marquise stopping Eugene with a cold and
rigid manner you will find it difficult to explain monsieur why your
pen should by accident write my name A name written on a letter
is not a friends operahat which you might have taken carelessly on
leaving a ball

Eugene discomfited looked at the marquise with an air that was both
stupid and conceited He felt that he was becoming ridiculous and after
stammering a few juvenile phrases he left the room

A few days later the marquise acquired undeniable proofs that Eugene had
told the truth For the last fortnight she has not been seen in society

The marquis tells all those who ask him the reason of this seclusion

My wife has an inflammation of the stomach

But I her physician who am now attending her know it is really
nothing more than a slight nervous attack which she is making the most
of in order to stay quietly at home

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
