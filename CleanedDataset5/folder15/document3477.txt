PART I INDOORS




The Long View

 Some day of days Some dawning
 yet to be
 I shall be clothed with immortality

 And in that day I shall not greatly care
 That Jane spilt candle grease upon the
 stair

 It will not grieve me then as once it did
 That careless hands have chipped my
 teapot lid

 I groan being burdened But in that
 glad day
 I shall forget vexations of the way

 That needs were often great when means
 were small
 Will not perplex me any more at all
 A few short years at most it may be less
 I shall have done with earthly storm and
 stress

 So for this day I lay me at Thy feet
 O keep me sweet my Master Keep
 me sweet





Within my House

 First theres the entrance narrow
 and so small
 The hatstand seems to fill the tiny hall
 That staircase too has such an awkward
 bend
 The carpet rucks and rises up on end
 Then all the rooms are cramped and close
 together
 And theres a musty smell in rainy weather
 Yes and it makes the daily work go hard
 To have the only tap across a yard
 These creaking doors these draughts this
 battered paint
 Would try I think the temper of a saint

 How often had I railed against these
 things
 With envies and with bitter murmurings
 For spacious rooms and sunny garden
 plots
 Until one day
 Washing the breakfast dishes so I think
 I paused a moment in my work to pray
 And then and there
 All life seemed suddenly made new and
 fair
 For like the Psalmists dove among the
 pots
 Those endless pots that filled the tiny
 sink
 My spirit found her wings

 Lord thus I prayed it matters not
 at all
 That my poor home is illarranged and
 small
 I not the house am straitened Lord
 tis I
 Enlarge my foolish heart that byandby
 I may look up with such a radiant face
 Thou shalt have glory even in this place
 And when I trip or stumble unawares
 In carrying water up these awkward stairs
 Then keep me sweet and teach me day
 by day
 To tread with patience Thy appointed
 way
 As for the house     Lord let it be
 my part
 To walk within it with a perfect heart





The Housewife

 See I am cumbered Lord
 With serving and with small vexa
 tious things
 Upstairs and down my feet
 Must hasten sure and fleet
 So weary that I cannot heed Thy word
 So tired I cannot now mount up with
 wings
 I wrestlehow I wrestlethrough the
 hours
 Nay not with principalities nor powers
 Dark spiritual foes of Gods and mans
 But with antagonistic pots and pans
 With footmarks in the hall
 With smears upon the wall
 With doubtful ears and small unwashen
 hands
 And with a babes innumerable demands

 I toil with feverish haste while teardrops
 glisten

 O child of mine be still And listen
 listen

 At last I laid aside
 Important work no other hands could do
 So well I thought no skill contrive so
 true
 And with my hearts door openopen
 wide
 With leisured feet and idle hands I sat
 I foolish fussy blind as any bat
 Sat down to listen and to learn And lo
 My thousand tasks were done the better so





To Mother

 I would that you should know
 Dear mother that I love youlove
 you so
 That I remember other days and years
 Remember childish joys and childish fears
 And this because my babys little hand
 Opened my own hearts door and made
 me understand

 I wonder how you could
 Be always kind and good
 So quick to hear to tend
 My smallest ills to lend
 Such sympathising ears
 Swifter than ancient seers
 I never yet knew hands so soft and kind
 Nor any cheek so smooth nor any mind
 So full of tender thoughts    Dear
 mother now
 I think that I can guess a little how
 You must have looked for some response
 some sign
 That all my tiresome wayward heart was
 thine

 And sure it was You were my first dear
 love
 You who first pointed me to God above
 You who seemed hearkening to my lightest
 word
 And in the dark night seasons always
 heard
 When I came trembling knocking at your
 door
 Forgive me mother if my whims outwore
 Your patient heart Or if in later days
 I sought out foolish unfamiliar ways
 If ever mother dear I loosed my hold
 Of your loved hand or headstrong
 thought you cold
 Forgive me mother Oh forgive me
 dear
 I am come back at lastyou see me
 here
 Your loving child    And mother
 on my knee
 I pray that thus my child may think of
 me





In Such an Hour

 Sometimes when everything goes
 wrong
 When days are short and nights are long
 When washday brings so dull a sky
 That not a single thing will dry
 And when the kitchen chimney smokes
 And when theres naught so queer as
 folks
 When friends deplore my faded youth
 And when the baby cuts a tooth
 While John the baby last but one
 Clings round my skirts till day is done
 When fat goodtempered Jane is glum
 And butchers man forgets to come

 Sometimes I say on days like these
 I get a sudden gleam of bliss
 Not on some sunny day of ease
 Hell come   but on a day like this
 And in the twinkling of an eye
 These tiresome things will all go by

 And tis a curious thing but Jane
 Is sure just then to smile again
 Or out the truant sun will peep
 And both the babies fall asleep
 The fire burns up with roar sublime
 And butchers man is just in time
 And oh My feeble faith grows strong
 Sometimes when everything goes wrong





The Daily Interview

 Such a sensation Sundays preacher
 made
 Christian he cried what is your stock
 intrade
 Alas Too often nil No time to pray
 No interview with Christ from day to day
 A hurried prayer maybe just gabbled
 through
 A random textfor any one will do
 Then gently lovingly with look intense
 He leaned towards us
 Is this common sense
 No person in his rightful mind will try
 To run his business so lest byandby
 The thing collapses smirching his good
 name
 And he insolvent face the world with
 shame

 I heard it all and something inly said
 That all was true The daily toil and press
 Had crowded out my hopes of holiness
 Still my old self rose reasoning
 How can you
 With strenuous work to do
 Real slogging worksay how can you
 keep pace
 With leisured folks Why you could
 grow in grace
 If you had time    the daily Interview
 Was never meant for those who wash and
 bake

 But yet a small Voice whispered
 For My sake
 Keep tryst with Me
 There are so many minutes in a day
 So spare Me ten
 It shall be proven then
 Ten minutes set apart can well repay
 You shall accomplish more
 If you will shut your door
 For ten short minutes just to watch and
 pray

 Lord if I do
 Set ten apart for You
 I dared yes dared to reason thus with
 Him
 The bakers sure to come
 Or Jane will call
 To say some visitor is in the hall
 Or I shall smell the porridge burning yes
 And run to stop it in my hastiness
 Theres not ten minutes Lord in all the
 day
 I can be sure of peace in which to watch
 and pray

 But all that night
 With calm insistent might
 That gentle Voice spake softly lovingly
 Keep tryst with Me
 You have devised a dozen different ways
 Of getting easy meals on washing days
 You spend much anxious thought on
 hopeless socks
 On moving ironmould from tiny frocks
 Twas you who found
 A way to make the sugar lumps go round
 You who invented ways and means of
 making
 Nice spicy buns for tea hot from the baking
 When margarine was short    and can
 not you
 Who made the time to join the butter queue
 Make time again for Me
 Yes will you not with all your daily
 striving
 Use womans wit in scheming and con
 triving
 To keep that tryst with Me

 Like ice long bound
 On powdered frosty ground
 My erring will all suddenly gave way
 The kind soft wind of His sweet pleading
 blew
 And swiftly silently before I knew
 The warm love loosed and ran
 Lifegiving floods began
 And so most lovingly I answered Him
 Lord yes I will and can
 I will keep tryst with Thee Lord come
 what may

 ENVOY

 It is a wondrous and surprising thing
 How that ten minutes takes the piercing
 sting
 From vexing circumstance and poison
 ous dart
 Hurled by the enemy straight at my
 heart
 So to the woman tempesttossed and
 tried
 By household cares and hosts of things
 beside
 With all my strength God bids me say
 to you
 Dear soul do try the daily Interview





The Little House

 One yestereve in the waning light
 When the wind was still and the
 gloaming bright
 There came a breath from a far countrie
 And the ghost of a Little House called
 to me

 Have you forgotten me No I cried
 Your hall was as narrow as this is wide
 Your roof was leaky the rain came
 through
 Till a ceiling fell on my new frock too

 In your parlour flooring a loose board hid
 And wore the carpet you know it did
 Your kitchen was small and the shelves
 were few
 While the fireplace smokedand you
 know its true

 The little ghost sighed Do you quite
 forget
 My window boxes of mignonette
 And the sunny room where you used to
 sew
 When a great hope came to you long ago

 Ah me How you used to watch the
 door
 Where a latchkey turned on the stroke
 of four
 And you made the tea and you poured
 it out
 From an old brown pot with a broken
 spout

 Now times have changed And your
 footman waits
 With the silver urn and the fluted plates
 But the little blind Love with the wings
 has flown
 Who used to sit by your warm hearth
 stone

 The little ghost paused Then Away
 I said
 Back to your place with the quiet dead
 Back to your place lest my servants see
 That the ghost of a Little House calls
 to me





The HouseMother

 Across the town the evening bell is
 ringing
 Clear comes the call through kitchen
 windows winging

 Lord knowing Thou art kind
 I heed Thy call to prayer
 I have a soul to save
 A heart which needs I think a double
 share
 Of sweetnesses which noble ladies crave
 Hope faith and diligence and patient
 care
 With meekness grace and lowliness of
 mind
 Lord wilt Thou grant all these
 To one who prays but cannot sit at ease

 They do not know
 The passersby who go
 Up to Thy house with saintly faces set
 Who throng about Thy seat
 And sing Thy praises sweet
 Till vials full of odours cloud Thy feet
 They do not know   
 And if they knew then would they greatly
 care
 That Thy tired handmaid washed the
 childrens hair
 Or with red roughened hands scoured
 dishes well
 While through the window called the
 evening bell
 And that her seeking soul looks upward
 yet
 THEY do not know    but THOU wilt
 not forget





A Woman in Hospital

 I know it all    I know
 For I am God I am Jehovah He
 Who made you what you are and I can
 see
 The tears that wet your pillow night by
 night
 When nurse has lowered that toobrilliant
 light
 When the talk ceases and the ward grows
 still
 And you have doffed your will
 I know the anguish and the helplessness
 I know the fears that toss you to and fro
 And how you wrestle weariful
 With hosts of little strings that pull
 About your heart and tear it so
 I know

 Lord do You know
 I had no time to put clean curtains up
 No time to finish darning all the socks
 Nor sew clean frilling in the childrens
 frocks
 And do You know about my Babys cold
 And how things are with my sweet three
 yearold
 Will Jane remember right
 Their cough mixture at night
 And will she ever think
 To brush the kitchen flues or scrub the
 sink

 And then theres John Poor tired
 lonely John
 No one will run to put his slippers on
 And not a soul but me
 Knows just exactly how he likes his tea
 It rends my heart to think I cannot go
 And minister to him   

 I know I know

 Then there are other things
 Dear Lord    more little strings
 That pull my heart Now Baby feels her
 feet
 She loves to run outside into the street
 And Janes hands are so full shell never
 see   
 And Im quite sure the clean clothes wont
 be aired
 At least not properly
 And oh I cant I really cant be spared
 My little house calls so

 I know
 And I am waiting here to help and bless
 Lay down your head Lay down your hope
 lessness
 And let Me speak
 You are so weary child you are so weak
 But let us reason out
 The darkness and the doubt
 This torturing fear that tosses you about

 I hold the universe I count the stars
 And out of shortened lives I build the
 ages   

 But Lord while such high things Thy
 thought engages
 I fearforgive melest
 Amid those limitless eternal spaces
 Thou shouldest in the high and heavenly
 places
 Pass over my affairs as things of nought
 There are so many houses just like mine
 And I so earthbound and Thyself Divine
 It seems impossible that Thou shouldst
 care
 Just what my babies wear
 And what John gets to eat    and
 can it be
 A circumstance of great concern to Thee
 Whether I live or die

 Have you forgotten then My child that I
 The Infinite the Limitless laid down
 The method of existence that I knew
 And took on Me a nature just like you
 I laboured day by day
 In the same dogged way
 That you have tackled household tasks
 And then
 Remember child remember once again
 Your own beloveds    did you really
 think
 Those days you toiled to get their meat
 and drink
 And made their clothes and tried to under
 stand
 Their little ailmentsdid you think your
 hand
 Your feeble hand was keeping them from ill
 I gave them life and life is more than meat
 Those little limbs so comely and so sweet
 You can make raiment for them and are glad
 But can you add
 One cubit to their stature Yet they grow
 Oh child hands off Hands off And
 leave them so
 I guarded hitherto I guard them still

 I have let go at last I have let go
 And oh the rest it is dear God to know
 My dear ones are so safe for Thou wilt
 keep
 Hands off at last Now I can go to
 sleep





In Convalescence

 Not long ago I prayed for dying
 grace
 For then I thought to see Thee face to
 face

 And now I ask Lord tis a weaklings
 cry
 That Thou wilt give me grace to live not
 die

 Such foolish prayers I know Yet
 pray I must
 Lord help mehelp me not to see the
 dust

 And not to nag nor fret because the blind
 Hangs crooked and the curtain sags be
 hind

 But oh The kitchen cupboards What a
 sight
 Twill take at least a month to get them
 right

 And that last cocoa had a smoky taste
 And all the milk has boiled away to waste

 Andno I resolutely will not think
 About the saucepans nor about the sink

 These light afflictions are but temporal
 things
 To rise above them wilt Thou lend me
 wings

 Then I shall smile when Jane with towzled
 hair
 And lumpy gruel clatters up the stair





Homesick

 I shut my eyes to rest em just a bit
 ago it seems
 An back among the Cotswolds I were
 wanderin in me dreams
 I saw the old grey homestead with the
 rickyard set around
 An catched the lowin of the herd a
 pleasant homelike sound
 Then on I went asingin through the
 pastures where the sheep
 Was lyin underneath the elms atryin for
 to sleep

 An where the stream was tricklin by half
 stifled by the grass
 Heaped over thick with buttercups I saw
 the corncrake pass
 For twas Summer Summer SUMMER
 An the blue forgetmenots
 Wiped out this dusty city and the smoky
 chimbley pots
 I clean forgot My Ladys gown the
 dazzlin sights Ive seen
 I was back among the Cotswolds where
 me heart has always been

 Then through the sixteenacre on I went
 a stiffish climb
 Right to the bridge where all our sheep
 comes up at shearin time
 There was the wild briar roses hangin
 down so pink an sweet
 Adroppin o their fragrance on the clover
 at my feet
 An here me heart stopped beatin for
 down by Gatcombes Wood
 My lad was workin with his team as only
 my lad could

 COME BACK was what the tricklin brook
 an breezes seemed to say
 TIS LONESOME ON THE COTSWOLDS NOW THAT
 MARY DREWS AWAY

 An back again Im goin for me wages
 has been paid
 An theyre lookin through the papers for
 another kitchen maid
 Back to the old grey homestead an the
 uplands cool an green
 To my lad among the Cotswolds where
 me heart has always been





On Washing Day

 Im going to granmas for a bit
 My mothers got the copper lit
 An piles of clothes are on the floor
 An steam comes out the washhouse door
 An Mrs Griggs has come an she
 Is just as cross as she can be
 Shes had her lunch and ate a lot
 I saw her squeeze the coffeepot
 An when I helped her make the starch
 She said Now Miss you just quick
 march
 What Touch them soapsuds if you
 durst
 Ill see you in the bluebag first
 An mother dried my frock an said
 Come back in time to go to bed
 Im off to granmas for you see
 At home they cant put up with me

 But down at granmas tis so nice
 If granmas making currantcake
 Shell let me put the ginger spice
 An grease the tin an watch it bake
 An then she says she thinks it fun
 To taste the edges when its done

 Thats granmas house Why hip
 hooray
 My granmas got a washing day
 For granpas shirts are on the line
 An stockings toosix seven eight nine
 Shell let me help her Yes shell tie
 Her apron round to keep me dry
 An on her little stool Ill stand
 Up to the washtub Twill be grand
 Theres no cross Mrs Griggs to say
 Young Miss is always in the way
 An me and granma will have tea
 At dinnertimejust her an me
 An eggs I spect an treacle rice
 My goodness Wont it all be nice

 Granma Im come to spend the day
 Cause mother finds me in the way
 Granma Ill peg the hankies out
 Granma Ill stir the starch about
 Granma Im come because you see
 At home they cant put up with me





When Baby Strayed

 When Baby strayed it seemed to
 me
 Sun moon and stars waned suddenly

 At once with frenzied haste my feet
 Ran up and down the busy street

 If ever in my life I prayed
 It was the evening Baby strayed

 And yet my great concern was this
 Not dread of losing Babys kiss

 And Babys soft small hand in mine
 And Babys comradeship divine

 Twas BABYS terror BABYS fears
 Whose hand but mine could dry her
 tears

 I without Baby In my need
 I were a piteous soul indeed

 But piteous far beyond all other
 A little child without a mother

 And God in mercy graciously
 Gave my lost darling back to me

 O high and lofty One
 THOU couldst have lived to all eternity
 Apart from ME
 In majesty upon that emerald throne
 Thou with Thy morning stars
 Thy dawns with golden bars
 And all the music of the heavenly train
 Possessing all things what hadst Thou to
 gain
 By seeking me
 What was I    and what am I   
 less than nought
 And yet Thy mercy sought
 Yea Thou hast set my feet
 Upon the way of holiness and sweet
 It is to seek Thee daily unafraid   

 But this I learnt the night that Baby
 strayed
 Here was Thy chief Thy great concern
 for me
 My desolate estate apart from Thee





If Only 

 If only dinner cooked itself
 And groceries grew upon the shelf
 If children did as they were told
 And never had a cough or cold
 And washed their hands and wiped their
 boots
 And never tore their Sunday suits
 But always tidied up the floor
 Nor once forgot to shut the door

 If John remembered not to throw
 His papers on the ground And oh
 If he would put his pipes away
 And shake the ashes on the tray
 Instead of on the floor close by
 And always spread his towel to dry
 And hung his hat upon the peg
 And never had bones in his leg

 Then theres another thing If Jane
 Would put the matches back again
 Just where she found them it would be
 A save of time to her and me
 And if she never did forget
 To put the dustbin out nor yet
 Contrive to gossip with the baker
 Nor need ten thunderbolts to wake her

 Ahem If wishes all came true
 I dont know what Id find to do
 Because if no one made a mess
 Thered be no need of cleanliness
 And things might work so blissfully
 In timewho knowstheyd not need
 me

 And this being so I fancy whether
 Ill go on keeping things together





Listening

 His step Ah no tis but the rain
 That hurtles on the window pane
 Lets draw the curtains close and sit
 Beside the fire awhile and knit
 Two purltwo plain A wellshaped
 sock
 And warm I thought I heard a knock
 But twas the slam of Joness door
 Yes good Scotch yarn is far before
 The fleecy woolsa different thing
 And best for wear Was that his ring
 No Tis the muffin man I see
 Well have threepennyworth for tea
 Two plaintwo purl that heel is neat
 I hear his step far down the street
 Two purltwo plain The sock can
 wait
 Ill make the tea Hes at the gate





The Dear Folks in
 Devon

 Back in the dear old country tis Christ
 mas and tonight
 Im thinking of the mistletoe and holly
 berries bright
 The smoke above our chimbley pots Id
 dearly love to see
 And those dear folks down in Devon
 how theyll talk and think of me

 Owd Benll bring the letters Christmas
 morn and if theres one
 As comes across from Canada straight
 from their absent son
 My Mothers handsll tremble and my
 Dadll likely say
 Dont seem like Christmas time no more
 with our dear lad away

 I can see em carve the Christmas beef
 and Brother Jimmys wife
 Will say her never tasted such no not in
 all her life
 And Sister Marthas Christmas pies melt
 in your mouth tis true
 But twas Mother made the puddin as
 mothers always do

 Ah me If I could just have wings and
 in the dimsey light
 Go stealing up the cobbled path this
 lonesome Christmas night
 Lift up the latch with gentle handMy
 What a shout thered be
 From those dear folks down in Devon
 What a welcomin for me





The Reason

 Why shouldest Thou be as a wayfaring man that
 turneth aside to tarry for a nightJer xiv 8

 Nay do not get the venison pasty
 out
 I shall not greatly put myself about
 Hungry he may be yes and we shall
 spare
 Some bread and cheese tis truly whole
 some fare
 We have tomorrows dinner still to find
 Its well for you I have a frugal mind

 Not the best bed No no Whatever
 next
 Why with such questionings should I be
 vext
 The man is naught to us why should
 we care
 The little attic room will do tis bare
 But hell be gone before tomorrows light
 He has but come to tarry for a night

 I shall not speak with him Oh no not I
 Lest I should pity overmuch or buy
 Some paltry ware of his Nay Ill to
 bed
 And he can sup alone well warmed and
 fed
 Tis much to take him in a night like this
 Why should I fret me with concerns of
 his

 Grey morning came and at the break of
 day
 The Man rose up and went upon his way





Two Women

 I beseech Euodias and beseech Syntyche that they
 be of the same mind in the LordPhil iv 2

 EUODIAS

 But if Paul heard her tattlings I am
 sure
 He never would expect me to endure
 There is a something in her very face
 Antagonistic to the work of grace
 And even when I would speak graciously
 Somehow Syntyches manner ruffles me

 SYNTYCHE

 No not for worlds Euodias has no
 mind
 So slow she is so spiritually blind
 Her tongue is quite unbridled yet she
 says
 She grieves to see my aggravating ways
 Ah no one but myself knows perfectly
 How odious Euodias can be

 EUODIAS

 Yet in the Lord Ah thats another
 thing

 SYNTYCHE

 Yet in the Lord That alters it in
 deed

 EUODIAS

 For His sake Ill endure her whispering

 SYNTYCHE

 For His sake Ill consent to let her lead

 EUODIAS

 Lord teach me to forbear yes day by
 day

 SYNTYCHE

 Lord keep me gentle now and all the
 way





The Prize Fight

 I am a boxer who does not inflict blows on the air
 but I hit hard and straight at my own body1 Cor
 ix 26 WEYMOUTHS Translation

 Twas breakfast time and outside in
 the street
 The factory men went by with hurrying
 feet
 And on the bridge in dim December light
 The newsboys shouted of the great prize
 fight
 Then as I dished the bacon and served
 out
 The porridge all our youngsters gave
 a shout
 The letterbox had clicked and through
 the din
 The Picture News was suddenly pushed in

 John showed the lads the pictures and
 explained
 Just how the fight took place and what
 was gained
 By that slim winner Then he looked at me
 As I sat busy pouring out the tea
 Your mother is a boxer rightly styled
 She hits the air sometimes though and
 John smiled
 Yet she fights on Young Jack with
 widened eyes
 Said Dad how soon will mother get a
 prize

 We laughed And yet it set me thinking
 how
 I beat the air because a neighbours cow
 Munched at our early cabbages and ate
 The lettuce up and tramped my mignon
 ette
 And many a time I kicked against the
 pricks
 Because the little dog at number six
 Disturbed my rest And then how cross
 I got
 When Jane seemed discontented with her
 lot
 Until poor John in desperation said
 He wearied of the themeand went to
 bed

 And how I vexed myself that day when he
 Brought people unexpectedly for tea
 Because the tablecloth was old and
 stained
 And not a single piece of cake remained
 And how my poor head ached Because
 well there
 It uses lots of strength to beat the air

 I am a boxer Here and now I pray
 For grace to hit the selflife every day
 And when the old annoyance comes once
 more
 And the old temper rises sharp and sore
 I shall hit hard and straight O Tender
 Wise
 And read approval in Thy loving eyes





The Home Lights

 In my fathers house The words
 Bring sweet cadence to my ears
 Wandering thoughts like homing birds
 Fly all swiftly down the years
 To that wide casement where I always see
 Bright lovelamps leaning out to welcome
 me

 Sweet it was how sweet to go
 To the worn familiar door
 No need to stand a while and wait
 Outside the wellremembered gate
 No need to knock
 The easy lock
 Turned almost of itself and so
 My spirit was at home once more
 And then within how good to find
 The same cool atmosphere of peace
 Where I a tired child might cease
 To grieve or dread
 Or toil for bread
 I could forget
 The dreary fret
 The strivings after hopes too high
 I let them every one go by
 The ills of life the blows unkind
 These fearsome things were left behind

 ENVOY

 O trembling soul of mine
 See how Gods mercies shine
 When thou shalt rise
 And stripped of earth shall stand
 Within an Unknown Land
 Alone where no familiar thing
 May bring familiar comforting
 Look up Tis but thy Fathers
 House And see
 His lovelamps leaning out to welcome
 thee





To an Old Teapot

 Now from the dust of halfforgotten
 things
 You rise to haunt me at the years Spring
 cleaning
 And bring to memory dim imaginings
 Of mystic meaning

 No oldtime potter handled you I ween
 Nor yet were you of gold or silver molten
 No Derby stamp nor Worcester can be
 seen
 Nor Royal Doulton

 You never stood to grace the princely
 board
 Of monarchs in some Oriental palace
 Your lid is chipped your chubby side is
 scored
 As if in malice

 I hesitate to say it but your spout
 Is with unhandsome rivets held together
 Mute witnesses of treatment meted out
 In regions nether

 O patient sufferer of many bumps
 I ask it gentlyshall the dustbin hold
 you
 And will the dustheap with its cabbage
 stumps
 At last enfold you

 It ought And yet with gentle hands I
 place
 You with my priceless Delft and Dresden
 china
 For sake of one who loved your homely
 face
 In days diviner





To a Rebellious
 Daughter

 You call authority a grievous thing
 With careless hands you snap the
 leading string
 And for a frolic so it seems to you
 Put off the old love and put on the new

 For What does Mother know of love
 you say
 Did her soul ever thrill
 Did little tendernesses ever creep
 Into her dreams and override her will
 Did her eyes shine or her heart ever leap
 As my heart leaps today
 I who am young who long to try my
 wings

 How should she understand
 She with her calm cool hand
 She never felt such yearnings And
 beside
 Its clear I cant be tied
 For ever to my mothers apron strings

 There are Infinities of Knowledge dear
 And there are mysteries not yet made
 clear
 To you the Uninitiate    Lifes book
 Is open yes but you may only look
 At its first section Youth
 Is part not all the truth
 It is impossible that you should see
 The end from the beginning perfectly

 You answer Even so
 But how can Mother know
 Who meditates upon the price of bacon
 On liberties the charwoman has taken
 And on the laundrys last atrocities
 She knows her cookery book
 And how a joint of English meat should
 look
 But all such things as these
 Make up her life She dwells in tents
 but I
 In a vast temple open to the sky

 Yet time was when that Mother stooped
 to learn
 The language written in your infant face
 For years she walked your pace
 And none but she interpreted your chatter
 Who else felt interest in such pitterpatter
 Or weary joined in all your games with
 zest
 And managed with a minimum of rest
 Now is it not your turn
 To bridge the gulf to span the gap be
 tween you
 Today before Deaths angel overlean
 you
 Before your chance is gone
 This is worth thinking on

 Are mothers blameless then Nay
 dearie nay
 Nor even tactful always Yet there may
 Come some grey dawning in the by
 and by
 When no more brave nor sure nor strong
 youll cry
 Aloud to God for that despised thing
 The old dear comfortMothers apron

 Up to the Hall my lady therell wear

 Fannys little dear
 For Fannys little Fannyoh shes took
 the heart of me

The Naughty Day

 Ive had a naughty day today
 I scrunched a biscuit in my hair
 And dipped my feeder in the milk
 And spread my rusk upon a chair

 When mother put me in my bath
 I tossed the water all about
 And popped the soap upon my head
 And threw the sponge and flannel out

 I wouldnt let her put my hand
 Inside the armhole of my vest
 I held the sleeve until she said
 I really never SHOULD be dressed

 And while she made the beds I found
 Her tidy and took out the hairs
 And then I got the watercan
 And tipped it headlong down the stairs

 I crawled along the kitchen floor
 And got some coal out of the box
 And drew black pictures on the walls
 And wiped my fingers on my socks

 Oh this HAS been a naughty day
 Thats why theyve put me off to bed
 He CANT get into mischief there
 Perhaps well have some peace they
 said

 They put the net across my cot
 Or else downstairs again Id creep
 But see Ill suck the counterpane
 To PULP before I go to sleep





To a Little White Bird

 Into the world you came and I was
 dumb
 Because God did it so the wise ones
 said
 I wonder sometimes Did you really
 come
 And Are you truly    DEAD

 Thus you went outalone and uncaressed
 O sweet soft thing in all your infant
 grace
 I never held you in my arms nor pressed
 Warm kisses on your face

 But in the Garden of the Undefiled
 My soul will claim you    you and
 not another
 I shall hold out my arms and say MY
 CHILD
 And you will call me MOTHER





Because

 PSALM CXVI

 Because He heard my voice and
 answered me
 Because He listened ah so patiently
 In those dark days when sorrowful alone
 I knelt with tears and prayed Him for a
 stone
 Because He said me Nay and then in
 stead
 Oh wonderful sweet truth He gave me
 bread
 Set my heart singing all in sweet accord
 Because of this I loveI love the Lord





When He Comes

 When He comes
 My sweetest When
 C ROSSETTI

 Thus may it be I thought at some
 days close
 Some lilachaunted eve when every rose
 Breathes forth its incense May He find
 me there
 In holy leisure lifting hands of prayer
 In some sweet garden place
 To catch the first dear wonder of His Face

 Or in my room above
 In silent meditation of His love
 My soul illumined with a rapture rare
 It would be sweet if even then these eyes
 Might glimpse Him coming in the East
 ern skies
 And be caught up to meet Him in the
 air

 But now Ah now the days
 Rush by their hurrying ways
 No longer know I vague imaginings
 For every hour has wings
 Yet my heart watches    as I work I
 say
 All simply to Him Come And if today
 Then wilt Thou find me thus just as I
 am
 Tending my household stirring goose
 berry jam
 Or swiftly rinsing tiny vests and hose
 With puzzled forehead patching some ones
 clothes
 Guiding small footsteps swift to hear and
 run
 From early dawn till setting of the sun

 And whensoeer He comes Ill rise and go
 Yes all the gladlier that He found me so





PART II OUT OF DOORS




Early Spring

 Quick through the gates of Fairyland
 The South Wind forced his way
 Twas his to make the Earth forget
 Her grief of yesterday
 Tis mine cried he to bring her joy
 And on his lightsome feet
 In haste he slung the snowdrop bells
 Pushed past the Fairy sentinels
 And out with laughter sweet

 Clear flames of Crocus glimmered on
 The shining way he went
 He whispered to the trees strange tales
 Of wondrous sweet intent
 When suddenly his witching voice
 With timbre rich and rare
 Rang through the woodlands till it cleft
 Earths silent solitudes and left
 A Dream of Roses there





The Witness

 The Master of the Garden said
 Who now the Earth seems cold
 and dead
 Will by his fearless witnessing
 Hold mens hearts for the tardy spring

 Not yet I am but half awake
 All drowsily the Primrose spake
 And fast the sleeping Daffodils
 Had folded up their golden frills

 Indeed the frail Anemone
 Said softly tis too cold for me
 Wood Hyacinths all deeply set
 Replied No ice has melted yet

 When suddenly with smile so bright
 Up sprang a Winter Aconite
 And to the Master joyfully
 She cried I will the witness be





In Somerset

 In Somerset they guide the plough
 From early dawn till twilight now
 The good red earth smells sweeter yet
 Behind the plough in Somerset
 The celandines round last years mow
 Blaze out    and with his oldtime vow
 The South Wind woos the Violet
 In Somerset

 Then every brimming dyke and trough
 Is laughing wide with ripples now
 And oh tis easy to forget
 That wintry winds can sigh and sough
 When thrushes chant on every bough
 In Somerset





Song of a Woodland
 Stream

 Silent was I and so still
 As day followed day
 Imprisoned until
 King Frost worked his will
 Held fast like a vice
 In his cold hand of ice
 For fear kept me silent and lo
 He had wrapped me around and about
 with a mantle of snow

 But sudden there spake
 One greater than he
 Then my heart was awake
 And my spirit ran free

 At His bidding my bands fell apart He
 had burst them asunder
 I can feel the swift wind rushing by me
 once more the old wonder
 Of quickening sap stirs my pulsesI
 shout in my gladness
 Forgetting the sadness
 For the Voice of the Lord fills the air

 And forth through the hollow I go where
 in glad April weather
 The trees of the forest break out into
 singing together
 And here the frail windflowers will cluster
 with young ferns uncurling
 Where broader and deeper my waters go
 eddying whirling
 To meet the sweet Spring on her journey
 His servant to be
 Whose word set me free


 Luggage in Advance

 The Fairies must have come I
 said
 For through the moist leaves brown and
 dead
 The Primroses are pushing up
 And heres a scarlet Fairycup
 They must have come because I see
 A single Wood Anemone
 The flower that everybody knows
 The Fairies use to scent their clothes
 And hark The South Wind blowing fills
 The trumpets of the Daffodils
 They MUST have come

 Then loud to me
 Sang from a budding cherry tree
 A cheerful Thrush    I say I say
 The Fairy Folk are on their way
 Look out Look out Beneath your feet
 Are all their treasures Sweet Sweet
 Sweet
 They could not carry them you see
 Those caskets crammed with witchery
 So ready for the first Spring dance
 They sent their Luggage in Advance





At the Cross Roads

 There I halted Further down the
 hollow
 Stood the township where my errand lay
 Firm my purpose till a voice cried
 Follow
 Come this wayI tell youcome this
 way

 Silence Thrush You know I think of
 buying
 A Springtide hat my frock is worn and
 old
 So to the shops I go Whats that youre
 crying
 Here Come here And gather primrose
 gold
 Well yes Some day I will but time is
 going
 I haste to purchase silks and satins fair
 Im all in rags The Ladys Smock is
 showing
 Up yonder in the little coppice there

 And wood anemones spread out their
 laces
 Each celandine has donned a silken gown
 The violets are lifting shy sweet faces
 And theres a chiffchaff soft and slim and
 brown

 But what about my hat The bees are
 humming
 And my new frock The hawthorns
 budding free
 Sweet Oh so sweet Well have your
 way Im coming
 And whos to blame for that Why me
 Me Me





Summer met Me

 Summer met me in the glade
 With a host of fair princesses
 Golden iris foxgloves staid
 Sunbeams flecked their gorgeous dresses
 Roses followed in her train
 Creamy elderflowers beset me
 Singing down the scented lane
 Summer met me

 Summer met me Harebells rang
 Honeysuckle clustered near
 As the royal pageant sang
 Songs enchanting to the ear
 Rainy days may come apace
 Nevermore to grieve or fret me
 Since in all her radiant grace
 Summer met me





The Carrier

 Owd Johns got past his work said
 they
 Last week as ever wasdont pay
 To send by him Hes stoopid too
 And brings things what wont never do
 Well send by post he is that slow
 And that owd hoss of his cant go

 But smornin well twas fun to see
 The gentlefolks run after we
 Squires lady stopped I in the lane
 Oh says she goin to town again
 Youll not mind calling into Bings
 To fetch my cakes and buns and things
 Ive got a party comin on
 And nought to eat    so DO ee John

 Then up the street who should I see
 But old Mam Bessant hailn me
 And Doctors wife and Mrs Higgs
 Was wantin vittles for their pigs
 And would I bring some Well what
 nex
 And Granny Dunn has broke her specs
 And wants em mended up in town
 So would John call and bring em down
 Tonight     and so the tale goes on
 Tis Sure you will now DO ee John

 Well tis a hevil wind that blows
 Nobody any good it shows
 As owd John haves his uses yet
 Though now and then he do forget
 Gee up owd gal When strikes is on
 Theyre glad of pore owd stoopid John





The Lads Love by the
 Gate

 Down in the dear West Country
 theres a garden where I know
 The Spring is rioting this hour though
 I am far away
 Where all the glad flowerfaces are old
 loves of long ago
 And each in its accustomed place is
 blossoming today

 The lilac drops her amethysts upon the
 mossy wall
 While in her boughs a cheerful thrush
 is calling to his mate
 Dear breath of mignonette and stocks
 I love you know you all
 And oh the fragrant spices from the
 lads love by the gate

 Kind wind from the West Country wet
 wind but scented so
 That straight from my dear garden
 you seem but lately come
 Just tell me of the yellow broom the
 guelder roses snow
 And of the tangled clematis where
 myriad insects hum

 Oh is there any heartsease left or any
 rosemary
 And in their own green solitudes say
 do the lilies wait
 I knew it Gentle wind but once
 speak low and tenderly
 How fares ittell me trulywith the
 lads love by the gate





The Thrush

 Across the land came a magic word
 When the earth was bare and
 lonely
 And I sit and sing of the joyous spring
 For twas I who heard I only
 Then dreams came by of the gladsome
 days
 Of many a wayside posy
 For a crocus peeps where the wild rose
 sleeps
 And the willow wands are rosy

 Oh the time to be When the paths
 are green
 When the primrosegold is lying
 Neath the hazel spray where the catkins
 sway
 And the dear south wind comes sigh
 ing

 My mate and I we shall build a nest
 So snug and warm and cosy
 When the kingcups gleam on the meadow
 stream
 Where the willow wands are rosy





In Dorset Dear

 In Dorset Dear theyre making hay
 In just the old West Country way
 With fork and rake and oldtime gear
 They make the hay in Dorset Dear
 From early morn till twilight grey
 They toss and turn and shake the hay
 And all the countryside is gay
 With roses on the fallen may
 For tis the haytime of the year
 In Dorset Dear

 The loaded waggons wend their way
 Across the pasturelands and stay
 Beside the hedge where foxgloves peer
 And ricks that shall be fashioned here
 Will be the sweetest stuff they say
 In Dorset Dear





The Flight of the Fairies

 Theres a rustle in the woodlands
 and a sighing in the breeze
 For the Little Folk are busy in the bushes
 and the trees
 They are packing up their treasures every
 one with nimble hand
 Ready for the coming journey back to
 sunny Fairyland

 They have gathered up the jewels from
 their beds of mossy green
 With all the dewy diamonds that summer
 morns have seen
 The silver from the lichen and the
 powdered gold dust too
 Where the buttercups have flourished and
 the dandelions grew

 They packed away the birdies songs
 then lest we should be sad
 They left the Robins carol out to make
 the winter glad
 They packed the fragrance of the flowers
 then lest we should forget
 Out of the pearly scented box they
 dropped a Violet

 Then oer a leafy carpet by the silent
 woods they came
 Where the golden bracken lingered and
 the maples were aflame
 On the stream the starlight shimmered oer
 their wings the moonbeams shone
 Music filtered through the forestand the
 Little Folk were gone





The Street Player

 The shopping had been tedious and
 the rain
 Came pelting down as she turned home
 again

 The motorbus swirled past with rush and
 whirr
 Nought but its fumes of petrol left for
 her

 The bloaters in her basket and the cheese
 Malodorously mixed themselves with
 these

 And all seemed wrong The world was
 drab and grey
 As the slow minutes wept themselves
 away

 And then athwart the noises of the street
 A violin flung out an Irish air

 Ill take you home again Kathleen
 Ah sweet
 How tendersweet those lilting phrases
 were

 They soothed away the weariness and
 brought
 Such peace to one worn woman over
 wrought

 That she forgot the things which vexed
 her so
 The too outrageous price of calico

 The shopgirls look of pitying insolence
 Because she paused to count the dwindling
 pence

 The player stopped But the rapt vision
 stayed
 That woman faced lifes worries unafraid

 The sugar shortage now had ceased to be
 An insurmountable calamity

 Her kingdom was not bacon no nor
 butter
 But things more costly still too rare to
 utter

 And over chimneypots so bare and tall
 The sun set gloriously after all





On All Souls Eve

 Oh the garden ways are lonely
 Winds that bluster winds that
 shout
 Battle with the strong laburnum
 Toss the sad brown leaves about
 In the gay herbaceous border
 Now a scene of wild disorder
 The last dear hollyhock has flamed his
 crimson glory out

 Yet upon this night of longing
 Souls are all abroad they say
 Will they come the dazzling blossoms
 That were here but yesterday
 Will the ghosts of radiant roses
 And my sheltered lilycloses
 Hold once more their shattered fragrance
 now Novembers on her way

 Wallflowers surely youll remember
 Pinks recall it will you not
 How I loved and watched and tended
 Made this ground a hallowed spot
 Pansies with the soft meek faces
 Harebells with a thousand graces
 Dear dead loves I wait and listen Tell
 me have you quite forgot

 HUSH THEY COME For down the path
 way
 Steals a fragrance honeysweet
 Larkspurs lilies stocks and roses
 Hasten now my heart to greet
 Stay oh stay My hands would hold
 you   
 But the arms that would enfold you
 Crush the bush of lads love growing in
 the dusk beside my feet





The Log Fire

 In her last hour of life the tree
 Gave up her glorious memories
 Wild scent of wood anemone
 The sapphire blue of April skies

 With faint but everstrengthning flame
 The dewdrenched hyacinthine spires
 Were lost as redgold bracken came
 With maple bathed in living fires

 Grey smoke of ancient clematis
 Towards the silver birch inclined
 And deep in thorny fastnesses
 The coral bryony entwined

 Then softly through the dusky room
 They strayed fair ghosts of other days
 With breath like early cherry bloom
 With tender eyes and gentle ways

 They glimmered on the sombre walls
 They danced upon the oaken floor
 Till through the loudly silent halls
 Joy reigned majestical once more

 Up blazed the fire and dazzling clear
 One rapturous Spirit radiant stood
 Twas you at last Yes YOU my dear
 We two were back in Gatcombe Wood





God save the King

 GOD SAVE OUR GRACIOUS KING It
 seems
 The Church is full of bygone dreams

 LONG LIVE OUR NOBLE KING My own
 Tis hard to stand here all alone

 GOD SAVE THE KING But sweetheart you
 Were always brave to dare and do

 SEND HIM VICTORIOUS For then
 My darling will come home again

 HAPPY AND GLORIOUS Twill be
 Like Heaven to himand what to me

 LONG TO REIGN OVER US My dear
 And wed been wedded one short year

 GOD SAVE OUR KING And Lord I pray
 Keep MY King safe this very day

 Forgive us thougreat Englands kingly
 King
 That thus do women National Anthems
 sing

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
