Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000
If they reach just 12 of the worlds population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by years end

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only about 4 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium

71 THE CRUISE OF THE POLLY ANN

In overhaulin one of my old trunks the tother day I found the

Brite Lexington of yooth when thar aint no sich word as fale on
the Wabash Canawl

Parst threw deliteful country Honest farmers was to work sowin
korn and other projuce in the fields Surblime scenery Large
redheded gal reclinin on the banks of the Canawl bathin her feet

Turned in at 15 minits parst eleving

ToosdyRiz at 5 and went up on the poop deck Took a grown
persons dose of licker with a member of the Injianny legislater
which he urbanely insisted on allowin me to pay for Bote tearin
threu the briny waters at the rate of 2 Nots a hour when the boy
on the leadin hoss shoutid

Sale hoe

Whar away hollered the capting clearin his glass a empty black
bottle with the bottom knockt out and bringing it to his Eagle
eye

Bout four rods to the starbud screamed the boy

Jes so screeched the capting What wessels that air

Kickin Warier of Terry Hawt and be darned to you

I I Sir hollered our capting Reef your arft hoss splice
your main jibboom and hail your chambermaid Whats up in Terry
Hawt

You know Bill Spikes said the capting of the Warier

Wall I reckin He can eat more fride pork nor any man of his heft
on the Wabash Hes a ornament to his sex

Wall continued the capting of the Kickin Warier Wilyim got a
little owly the tother day and got to prancin around town on that
old white mare of hisn and bein in a playful mood he rid up in
front of the Court us whar old Judge Perkins was a holdin Court
and let drive his rifle at him The bullet didnt hit the Judge at
all it only jes whizzed parst his left ear lodgin in the wall
behind him but what dye spose the old despot did Why he
actooally fined Bill ten dollars for contempt of Court What do
you think of that axed the capting of the Warier as he parst a
long black bottle over to our capting

The country is indeed in danger said our capting raisin the
bottle to his lips The wessels parted No other incidents that
day Retired to my chased couch at 5 minits parst 10

WensdyRiz arly Wind blowin NWE Hevy sea on and ship rollin
wildly in consekents of peppercorns havin been fastened to the
forrerd hosss tale Heave two roared the capting to the man at
the rudder as the Polly giv a friteful toss I was sick an sorry
Id cum Heave two repeated the capting I went below Heave
two I hearn him holler agin and stickin my hed out of the cabin
winder I HEV

The hosses became docile eventually and I felt better The sun
bust out in all his splender disregardless of expense and lovely
Natur put in her best licks We parst the beautiful village of
Limy which lookt sweet indeed with its neat white cottages
Institoots of learnin and other evijences of civillizashun

my 2 poetic sole I went below to breakfast but vittles had lost
their charms Take sum of this said the Capting shovin a bottle
tords my plate Its whisky A few quarts allers sets me right
when my stummick gits out of order Its a excellent tonic I
declined the seductive flooid

ThursdyDidnt rest well last night on account of a uprore made by
the capting who stopt the Bote to go ashore and smash in the
windows of a grosery He was brought back in about a hour with his
hed dun up in a red handkercher his eyes bein swelled up orful and
his nose very much out of jint He was brot aboard on a shutter by
his crue and deposited on the cabin floor the passenjers all risin

see what the matter was Why do you allow your pashuns to run away
with you in this onseemly stile my misgided frend said a sollum
lookin man in a red flannel nitecap Why do you sink yourself to
the Beasts of the field

Wall the fack is said the capting risin hisself on the shutter
Ive bin a little prejoodiced agin that grosery for some But I
made it lively for the boys deacon Bet yer life He larfed a
short wild larf and called for his jug Sippin a few pints he
smiled gently upon the passengers sed Bless you Bless you and
fell into a sweet sleep

Eventually we reached our jernys end This was in the days of Old

Them was happy days when people was intelligent  wax figgers 
livin wild beests wasnt scoffed at

 O dase of me boyhood

72 ARTEMUS WARDS AUTOBIOGRAPHY

 New York near Fifth Avenoo Hotel Org 31ct

EDITER OF PLAY BILL

Dr SirYrs into which you ask me to send you sum leadin incidents
in my life so you can write my Bogfry for the papers cum dooly to
hand I hav no doubt that a article onto my life grammattycally
jerked and properly punktooated would be a addition to the chois
literatoor of the day

To the youth of Ameriky it would be vallyble as showin how high a
pinnykle of fame a man can reach who commenst his career with a
small canvas tent and a peagreen ox which he rubbed it off while
scrachin hisself agin the center pole causin in Rahway NY a
discriminatin mob to say humbugs would not go down in their village
The ox resoomd agricultooral pursoots shortly afterwards

I next tried my hand at givin Blindman concerts appearin as the
poor blind man myself But the infamus cuss who I hired to lead me
round towns in the day time to excite simpathy drank freely of
spiritoous licker unbeknowns to me one day  while under their
inflooance he led me into the canal I had to either tear the green
bandige from my eyes or be drownded I thot Id restore my
eyesight

In writin about these things Mr Editer kinder smooth em over
Speak of em as eccentrissities of genus

My next ventur would hav bin a success if I hadnt tried to do too
much I got up a series of wax figgers and among others one of
Socrates I thot a wax figger of old Sock would be poplar with
eddycated peple but unfortinitly I put a Brown linen duster and a
US Army regulation cap on him which peple with classycal
eddycations said it was a farce This enterprise was onfortnit in
other respecks At a certin town I advertised a wax figger of the
Honble Amos Perkins who was a Railroad President and a great
person in them parts But it appeared I had shown the same figger
for a Pirut named Gibbs in that town the previs season which
created a intense toomult  the audience remarked shame onto me
 other statements of the same similarness I tried to mollify em
I told em that any family possessin children might have my she
tiger to play with half a day  I wouldnt charge em a cent but
alars it was of no avail I was forced to leave  I infer from a
article in the Advertiser of that town in which the Editer says
Atho time has silvered this mans hed with its frosts he still
brazenly wallows in infamy Still are his snakes stuffed and his
wax works unrelible We are glad that he has concluded never to
revisit our town altho incredible as it may appear the fellow
really did contemplate so doing last summer when still true to the
craven instincts of his black heart he wrote the hireling knaves of
the obscure journal across the street to know what they would charge
for 400 small bills to be done on yellow paper We shall recur to
this matter again

I say I infer from this article that a prejudiss still exists agin
me in that town

I will not speak of my once bein in straitend circumstances in a
sertin town and of my endeaverin to accoomulate welth by lettin
myself to Sabbath School picnics to sing ballads adapted to the
understandins of little children accompanyin myself on a
claironettwhich I forgot where I was one day singing instid of
Oh how pleasant to be a little child

 Rip slapset em up again
 Right in the middle of a threecent pie

which mistake added to the fact that I couldnt play onto the
claironett except makin it howl dismal broke up the picnic and
children said in voices choked with sobs and emotions where was
their home and where was their Pa and I said Be quiet dear
children I am your Pa which made a young woman with two twins by
her side say very angryly Good heavens forbid you should ever be
the Pa of any of these innocent ones unless it is much desirable
for them to expire igminyusly upon to a murderers gallus

I say I will not speak of this Let it be Berrid into Oblivyun

In your article Mr Editer please tell him what sort of a man I
am

If you see fit to kriticise my Show speak your mind freely I do
not object to kriticism Tell the public in a candid and graceful
article that my Show abounds in moral and startlin cooriosities
any one of whom is wuth dubble the price of admission

I hav thus far spoke of myself excloosivly as a exhibiter

I was born in the State of Maine of parents As a infant I
attracted a great deal of attention The nabers would stand over my
cradle for hours and say How bright that little face looks How
much it nose The young ladies would carry me round in their arms
sayin I was muzzers bezzy darlin and a sweety eety ittle ting
It was nice tho I wasnt old enuf to properly appreciate it Im
a healthy old darlin now

I have allers sustained a good moral character I was never a
Railroad director in my life

Altho in early life I did not invably confine myself to truth in
my small bills I have been gradoolly growin respectabler and
respectabler evry year I luv my children and never mistake
another mans wife for my own Im not a member of any meetin house
but firmly beleve in meetin houses and shouldnt feel safe to take
a dose of laudnum and lay down in the street of a village that
hadnt any with a thousand dollars in my vest pockets

My temperament is billious altho I dont owe a dollar in the
world

I am a early riser but my wife is a Presbyterian I may add that I
am also baldheded I keep two cows

I live in Baldinsville Indiany My next door naber is Old Steve
Billins Ill tell you a little story about Old Steve that will make
you larf He jined the Church last spring and the minister said
You must go home now Brothern Billins and erect a family altar in
your own house whereupon the egrejis old ass went home and built a
reglar pulpit in his sittin room He had the jiners in his house
over four days

I am 56 56 years of age Time with its relentless scythe is
ever busy The Old Sexton gathers them in he gathers them in I
keep a pig this year

I dont think of anything more Mr Edter

If you should giv my portrait in connection with my Bogfry please
have me ingraved in a languishin attitood learnin on a marble
pillar leavin my back hair as it is nowTrooly yours

Artemus Ward

73 THE SERENADE

Things in our town is workin The canal boat Lucy Ann called in
here the other day and reported all quiet on the Wabash The Lucy
Ann has adopted a new style of Binnakle light in the shape of a
redheaded girl who sits up over the compass It works well

The artist I spoke about in my larst has returned to Philadelphy
Before he left I took his lilywhite hand in mine I suggested to
him that if he could induce the citizens of Philadelphy to believe
it would be a good idea to have white windershutters on their
houses and white doorstones he might make a fortin Its a
novelty I added and may startle em at fust but they may
conclood to adopt it

As several of our public men are constantly being surprised with
serenades I concluded Id be surprised in the same way so I made
arrangements accordin I asked the Brass Band how much theyd take
to take me entirely by surprise with a serenade They said theyd
overwhelm me with a unexpected honor for seven dollars which I
excepted

I wrote out my impromptoo speech severil days beforehand bein very
careful to expunge all ingramatticisms and payin particuler
attention to the punktooation It was if I may say it without
egitism a manly effort but alars I never delivered it as the
sekel will show you I paced up and down the kitchin speakin my
piece over so as to be entirely perfeck My bloomin young daughter
Sarah Ann bothered me summut by singin Why do summer roses fade

Because said I arter hearin her sing it about fourteen times
because its their biz Let em fade

Betsy said I pausin in the middle of the room and letting my
eagle eye wander from the manuscripBetsy on the night of this
here serenade I desires you to appear at the winder dressed in
white and wave a lilywhite handkercher Dye hear

If I appear said that remarkable female I shall wave a
lilywhite bucket of bilin hot water and somebody will be scalded
One baldheaded old fool will get HIS share

She referd to her husband No doubt about it in my mind But for
fear she might exasperate me I said nothin

The expected night cum At nine oclock precisely there was sounds
of footsteps in the yard and the Band struck up a lively air which
when they did finish it there was cries of Ward Ward I stept
out onto the portico A brief glance showed me that the assemblage
was summut mixed There was a great many ragged boys and there was
quite a number of grownup persons evigently under the affluence of
the intoxicatin bole The Band was also drunk Dr Schwazey who
was holdin up a post seemed to be particly drunkso much so that
it had got into his spectacles which were staggerin wildly over his
nose But I was in for it and I commenced

Feller CitizensFor this onexpected honor

LEADER OF THE BANDWill you give us our money now or wait till
you git through

To this painful and disgustin interruption I paid no attention

for this onexpected honor I thank you

LEADER OF THE BANDBut you said youd give us seven dollars if
wed play two choons

Again I didnt notice him but resumed as follows

I say I thank you warmly When I look at this crowd of true
Americans my heart swells

DR SCHWAZEYSo do I

A VOICEWe all do

my heart swells

A VOICEThree cheers for the swells

We live said I in troublous times but I hope we shall again
resume our former proud position and go on in our glorious career

DR SCHWAZEYIm willin for one to go on in a glorious career
Will you join me fellowcitizens in a glorious career What wages
does a man git for a glorious career when he finds himself

Dr Schwazey said I sternly you are drunk Youre disturbin
the meetin

DR SHave you a banquet spread in the house I should like a
rhunossyross on the half shell or a hippopotamus on toast or a
horse and wagon roasted whole Anything thats handy Dont put
yourself out on me account

At this point the Band begun to make hidyous noises with their brass
horns and an exceedingly ragged boy wanted to know if there wasnt
to be some wittles afore the concern broke up I didnt exactly
know what to do and was just on the point of doin it when a upper
winder suddenly opened and a stream of hot water was brot to bear
on the disorderly crowd who took the hint and retired at once

When I am taken by surprise with another serenade I shall among
other arrangements have a respectful company on hand So no more
from me today When this you see remember me

74 OBOURCYS ARRAHNAPOGUE

You axe me sir to sling sum ink for your paper in regards to the
new Irish dramy at Niblos Garding I will do it sir

I knew your grandfather well sir Sum 16 years ago while I was
amoosin and instructin the intellectoal peple of Cape Cod with my
justly poplar Show I saw your grandfather He was then between
96 years of age but his mind was very clear He told me I looked
like George Washington He said I had a massiv intellect Your
grandfather was a highlyintelligent man and I made up my mind then
that if I could ever help his family in any way Id do so Your
grandfather gave me sum clams and a Testament He charged me for
the clams but threw in the Testament He was a very fine man

I therefore rite for you which insures your respectability at once
It gives you a moral tone at the word go

I found myself the other night at Niblos Garding which is now by
the way Wheatleys Garding I dont know whats bcum of Nib I
couldnt see much of a garding however and it struck me if Mr
Wheatley depended on it as regards raisin things hed run short of
gardin sass NBThese remarks is yoomerous The older I gro
the more I want to goak

I walked down the isle in my usual dignified stile politely tellin
the people as I parsed along to keep their seats Dont git up for
me I sed One of the prettiest young men I ever saw in my life
showed me into a seat and I proceeded to while away the spare time
by reading Thompsons Bank Note Reporter and the comic papers

The ordinance was large

I thot from a cursiry view that the Finnigan Brotherhood was well
represented

There was no end of bootiful wimin and a heap of good clothes
There was a good deal of hair present that belonged on the heds of
peple who didnt cum with itbut this is a ticklish subjeck for me
I larfed at my wifes waterfall which indoosed that superior woman
to take it off and heave it at me rather vilently and as there was
about a half bushil of it it knockt me over and give me pains in
my body which I haint got over yit

The orkistry struck up a toon  I asked the Usher to nudge me when
Mr Pogue cum on the stage to act

I wanted to see Pogue but strange to say he didnt act during the
entire evenin I reckin he has left Niblos and gone over to
Barnums

Very industrious pepl are the actors at Barnums They play all
day and in the evenin likewise I meetm every mornin at five
oclock going to their work with their tin dinnerpails Its a
sublime site Many of them sleep on the premises

ArrahnaPogue was writ by Dion OBourcicolt  Edward McHouse They
writ it well OBourcy has writ a cartload of plays himself the
most of which is fustrate

I understand there is a large number of Ogentlmen of this city who
can rite better plays than OBourcy does but somehow they dont
seem to do it When they do Ill take a Box of them

As I remarked to the Boy who squirted peppersass through a tin
dinnerhorn at my trained Bear which it caused that feroshus animal
to kick up his legs and howl dismal which fond mothers fell into
swoons and children cride to go home because fearin the Bear would
leave his jungle and tear them from limb to limb and then excoosed
himself this Boy did by sayin he had done so while labourin under
a attack of Moral Insanityas I sed to that thrifty youth I allus
incurridge geenyus whenever I see it

Its the same with Dan Bryant I am informed there are better Irish
actors than he is but somhow Im allus out of town when they act 
so is other folks which is whats the matter

ACK THE 1Glendalo by moonlite

Irishmen with clubs

This is in 1798 the year of your birth Mr Editor

It appears a patriotic person named McCool has bin raisin a
insurrection in the mountain districts and is now goin to leave the
land of his nativity for a tower in France Previsly to doin so he
picks the pockit of Mr Michael Feeny a govment detectiv which
pleases the gallery very much indeed and they joyfully remark hi
hi

He meets also at this time a young woman who luvs him dearer than
life and who is of course related to the govment and just as
the govment goes agin him she goes for him This is natral but
not grateful She sez And can it be so Ar tell me it is not so
thusly as this thusness wouldst seem or words to that effect

He sez it isnt any other way and they go off

Irish moosic by the Band

Mr McCool goes and gives the money to his fostersister Miss Arrah
Meelish who is goin to shortly marry Shaun the Lamp Post Mac
then alters his mind about goin over to France and thinks hell go
upstairs and lie down in the straw This is in Arrahs cabin
Arrah says its all right me darlint och hone and shure and
other poplar remarks and Mac goes to his straw

The wedding of Shaun and Arrah comes off

Great excitement Immense demonstration on the part of the
peasantry Barndoor jigs and rebelyus song by McHouse called
The Drinkin of the Gin Ha what is this Soldiers cum in
Moosic by the band Arrah sez the Major you have those money
She sez Oh no I guess not He sez Oh yes I guess you have
It is my own sez she and exhibits it It is mine says Mr
Feeny and identifies it

Great confusion

Coat is prodoosed from upstairs

Whose coat is this sez the Major Is it the coat of a young man
secreted in this here cabin

Now this is rough on Shaun His wife accoosed of theft the
circumstances bein very much agin her and also accoosed of havin a
hansum young man hid in her house But does this bold young
Hibernian forsake her Not much he dont But he takes it all on
himself sez he is the guilty wretch and is marcht off to prison

This is a new idea It is ginrally the wife who suffers in the
play for her husband but heres a noble young feller who shuts
both his eyes to the apparent sinfulness of his new young wife and
takes her right square to his bosom It was bootiful to me who
love my wife and believe in her and would put on my meetin clothes
and go to the gallus for her cheerfully ruther than believe she was
capable of taking anybodys money but mine My marrid friends
listen to me If you treat your wives as though they were perfeck
gentlemenif you show em that you have entire confidence in them
believe me they will be troo to you most always

I was so pleased with this conduct of Shaun that I hollered out
Good boy Come and see me

Silence sum people said

Put him out said a sweetscented young man with all his new
clothes on and in company with a splendid waterfall put this old
fellow out

My young friend said I in a loud voice whose store do you sell
tape in I might want to buy a yard before I go hum

Shaun is tried by a Military Commission Colonel OGrady although
a member of the Commission shows he sympathizes with Shaun and
twits Feeny the Govment witness with being a knockkneed thief
c c Mr Stantons grandfather was Secy of War in Ireland at
that time so this was entirely proper

Shaun is convicted and goes to jail Hears Arrah singin outside
Wants to see her a good deal A lucky thought strikes him he opens
the window and gets out Struggles with ivy and things on the
outside of the jail and finally reaches her just as Mr Feeny is
about to dash a large wooden stone onto his head He throws Mr F
into the river Pardon arrives Fond embraces Tears of joy and
kisses a la Pogue Everybody much happy

Curtain falls

This is a very harty outline of a splendid play Go and see it
Yours till then

75 ARTEMUS WARD AMONG THE FENIANS

PRELIMINARY

Sparkling with genuine fun and bristling with pungent satire
this is an epitome of Artemus Wards most genial humour and of
his keenly sarcastic truth The doings of the Fenians have
hitherto been sufficiently ludicrous to merit the ridicule
which Artemus has added to the stock they have liberally
provided for themselves To use the periphrasis of Senator
Sumner they have hitherto been the muscipular abortion of
the parturient mountain whatever their folly may yet lead
them to effect of a more serious nature in time to come As a
curiosity of literature worthy of being preserved for the
amusement of posterity a leading article on the Fenians
extracted from a New York paper of most extensive circulation is
given below Such another leader as the one here given could
not be met with in the press of any land in the world except in
that of the United States

 THE FENIAN TROUBLES AT AN ENDTHE HEAD CENTRE VICTORIOUS

 The unmitigated blackguards and miserable spalpeens who
 raised the standard of revolt against the brave and gallant
 OMahony are knocked into the most infinitesimal
 smithereens and chawed up until there is not as much left
 of them as remained after the toothandnail conflict of the
 Kilkenny cats The blessed and holy St Patrick may the
 heavens be his bed in glory never more thoroughly
 extinguished the toads snakes bedbugs mosquitoes and
 varmint in general which he drove out of Ould Ireland than
 OMahony the gallant Head Centre squelched exterminated
 crushed out and extinguished the cantankerous Senators and
 rebellious disciples of the brotherhood who thought to
 clutch the evergreen laurels and verdant greenbacks with
 which a patriotic and confiding people have encircled his
 brow and lined his wallet As the blessed St Patrick afore
 said compelled the varmints to betake themselves to the
 swamps and morasses and chased the frogs into the bogs
 so the redoubtable 0Mahony has compelled the rebellious
 Fenians to hide their diminished heads and betake themselves
 to the recesses of oblivion where their contortions will be
 watched by the observer of futurity as the visitors of
 Blarney Castle are edified by the gambols of the comely
 eels in the verdant mud The brave 0Mahony has come forth
 from the contest like gold from the crucible or whisky from
 the still purified etherealised and elevated while his
 antagonists have shrunk away like dross or swill never more
 to mingle with the Olympian deliberation and Jovelike
 councils of the Moffatt Mansion Instead of participating
 in these august deliberations they will go back to their
 shanties and there behold the glories they are unworthy to
 share As if the OMahony bludgeon had not knocked the
 breath completely out of the revolters the idolised
 Stephens who like the Roman Curtius jumped into the gulf
 of Irish nationality published a letter and a proclamation
 which must satisfy the public that the recreants kilt
 intirely and may as well give their neighbours a pleasant
 wake and a decent burial as expect to survive the period of
 their inevitable dissolution His proclamation comes down
 on them like a shillaly in Donnybrook and if it does not
 ventilate their skulls it is because those cranial
 envelopes are as impervious to physical force as to the
 gentle influence of reason or patriotism Having demolished
 the rebellious Senate and their backers the next thing
 0Mahony has to do is to wipe out the bloody Saxon and
 reestablish the nationality of the Emerald Isle as it
 existed in the days of Brian Boru As Queen Victoria is a
 woman we do not expect to see her locked up like Jeff
 Davis but she will be allowed to emigrate to New York and
 open a boardingschool or a drygoods store where she will
 remain unmolested as long as she behaves herself

JOHN CAMDEN HOTTEN Piccadilly W Jan 30 1865

 To Home April 1866

The Finians conveened in our town the other night and took steps
toord freein Ireland They met into the Town Hall and by the kind
invite of my naber Mr Mulrooney OShaughnessy whose ancestors at
least must have Irish blood in their veins I went over

You may not be awair by the way that Ive been a invalid here to
home for sevril weeks And its all owin to my own improodens
Not feelin like eating a full meal when the cars stopt for dinner
in the South where I lately was I went into a Resterater and et 20
hard biled eggs I think they effected my Liver

My wife says Po po She says Ive got a splendid liver for a man
of my time of life Ive heard of mens livers gradooally wastin
away till they hadnt none Its a dreadful thing when a mans
liver gives him the shake

Two years ago comin this May I had a tack of fevernager and by
the advice of Miss Peasley who continues single and is
correspondinly unhappy in the same ratios I consulted a Spiritul
mejuma writin mejum I got a letter from a celbrated Injin
chief who writ me accordin to the mejum that hed been ded two
hundred and seventeen 217 years and liked it He then said let
the Pale face drink sum yarb tea I drinkt it and it really helpt
me Ive writ to this talented savige this time thro the same
mejum but as yet I haint got any answer Perhaps hes in a spear
where they haint got any postage stamps

But thanks to careful nussin Im improvin rapid

The Town Hall was jamfull of peple mostly Irish citizens and the
enthusiasm was immense They cheerd everybody and everything
They cheerd me

Hurroo for Ward Hurroo

They was all good nabers of mine and I ansered in a pleasant voice
All right boys all right Mavoorneen och hone aroon Cooshla
macree

These Irish remarks bein received with great applaus I added
Mushler mushler

Good good cried Captain Spingler who desires the Irish vote for
country clerk thats fus rate

You see what Im drivin at dont you Cap I said

Certainly

Well I ansered Im very glad you do becaus I dont

This made the Finians larf and they said Walk up onto the
speakers platform sir

The speeches was red hot agin England and hir iron heel and it was
resolved to free Ireland at onct But it was much desirable before
freein her that a large quantity of funds should be raised And
like the genrous souls as they was funs was librally
contribooted Then arose a excitin discussion as to which head
center they should send em toOMahony or McRoberts There was
grate excitement over this but it was finally resolved to send half
to one and half to tother

Then Mr Finnigan rose and said We have here tonight sum citizens
of American birth whom we should be glad to hear It would fill
our harts with speechless joy to hear from a man whose name towers
high in the zoological and waxfigger worldfrom whose pearly
lips

Says I Go slow Finny go slow

We wish to hear continued Mr Finnigan moderatin his stile
summut from our townsman Mr Ward

I begd to be declined but it want no use I rose amid a perfeck
uproar of applause

I said we had convened there in a meetin as I understood it or
rather in a body as it were in reference to Ireland If I knew my
own hart every one of us there both grate and small had an impulse
flowin in his boosum and consequentially I added we will stick
to it similar and in accordance therewith as long as a spark of
manhood or the peple at large Thats the kind of man I be

Squire Thaxter interrupted me The Squire feels the wrongs of
Ireland deeply on accounts of havin onct courted the widder of a
Irish gentleman who had lingered in a loathsum dunjin in Dublin
placed there by a English tarvernkeeper who despotically wanted
him to pay for a quantity of chops and beer he had consoomd
Besides the Squire wants to be reelected Justice of the Peace
Mr Ward he said youve bin drinkin Youre under the
infloonce of licker sir

Says I Squire not a drop of good licker has passed my lips in
fifteen years

Cries of Oh here now that wont do

It is troo I said Not a drop of good licker has passed my lips
in all that time I dont let it pass em I reach for it while
its goin by says I Squire harness me sum more

I beg pardon said the Squire for the remark you are sober but
what on airth are you drivin at

Yes I said thats just it Thats what Ive bin axin myself
during the entire evenin What is this grate meetin drivin at
Whats all the grate Finian meetins drivin at all over the country

My Irish frens you know me well enuff to know that I didnt come
here to disturb this meetin Nobody but a loafer will disturb any
kind of a meetin And if youll notice it them as are up to this
sort of thing allers come to a bad end There was a young manI
will not mention his namewho disturbd my show in a certain town
two years ago by makin remarks disrespectful of my animals
accompanied by a allosan to the front part of my hed which as you
see it is Baldsayin says this young man You sandpaper it too
much but youve got a beautiful head of hair in the back of your
neck old man This made a few ignent and lowmindid persons larf
but what was the fate of that young man In less than a month his
aunt died and left him a farm in Oxford county Maine The human
mind can pictur no grater misfortun than this

No my Irish frens I am here as your naber and fren I know YOU
are honest in this Finian matter

But let us look at them Head Centers Let us look at them
riproarin orators in New York whove bin tearin round for upards
a year swearin Ireland shall be free

Theres two partiesOMcMahoneys and McORoberts One thinks the
best way is to go over to Canady and establish a Irish Republic
there kindly permittin the Canadians to pay the expenses of that
sweet Boon and the other wants to sail direck for Dublin Bay where
young McRoy and his fair young bride went down and was drownded
accordin to a ballad I onct heard But theres one pint on which
both sides agreethats the Funs Theyre willin them chaps in
New York to receive all the Funs youll send em You send a puss
tonight to Mahony and another puss to Roberts Both will receive
em You bet And with other pusses it will be simlar

I went into Mr Delmonicos eatinhouse the other night and I saw
my fren Mr Terence McFadden who is a elekent and enterprisin
deputy Centre He was sittin at a table eatin a canvasback duck
Poultry of that kind as you know is rather high just now I think
about five dollars per Poult And a bottle of green seal stood
before him

How are you Mr McFadden I said

Oh Mr Ward I am miserablemiserable The wrongs we Irishmen
suffers Oh Ireland Will a troo history of your sufferins ever
be written Must we be ever ground under by the iron heel of
despotic Briton But Mr Ward wont you eat suthin

Well I said if theres another caanvasback and a spare bottle
of that green seal in the house I wouldnt mind jinin you in bein
ground under by Britons iron heel

Green turtle soup first he said

Well yes If Im to share the wrongs of Ireland with you I
dont care if I do have a bowl of soup Put a bean into it I said
to the waiter It will remind me of my childhood days when we had
em baked in conjunction with pork every Sunday mornin and then all
went up to the village church and had a refreshin nap in the famly
pew

Mr McFadden who was sufferin so thurily for Ireland was of the
Mahony wing Ive no doubt that some ekally patriotic member of the
Roberts wing was sufferin in the same way over to the MasonDory
eatinhouse

They say fellercitizens soon you will see a Blow struck for
Irish liberty We haint seen nothin BUT a Blow so farits bin
all blow and the blowers in New York wont git out of Bellusses as
long as our Irish frens in the rooral districks send em money

Let the Green float above the red if thatll make it feel any
better but dont you be the Green Dont never go into anything
till you know whereabouts youre goin to

This is a very good country here where you are You Irish hav
enjoyed our boons held your share in our offices and you certainly
have done your share of our votin Then why this hullaballoo about
freein Ireland You do your frens in Ireland a great injoory too
because they blieve youre comin sure enuff and they fly off the
handle and git into jail My Irish frens ponder these things a
little Zamine em closely and above all find out where the
pusses go to

I sot down There was no applaws but they listened to me kindly
They knowd I was honest however wrong I might be and they knowd
too that there was no peple on arth whose generosity and gallantry
I had a higher respect for than the Irish excep when they fly off
the handle So my feller citizens let me toot my horn

But Squire Thaxter put his hand onto my hed and said in a mournful
tone of vois Mr Ward your mind is failin Your intellect
totters You are only about sixty years of age yet you will soon
be a drivelin dotard and hav no control over yourself

I have no control over my arms now I replied drivin my elbows
suddenly into the Squires stomack which caused that corpulent
magistrate to fall vilently off the stage into the fiddlers box
where he stuck his venerble hed into a base drum and stated
Murder twice in a very loud vois

It was late when I got home The children and my wife was all abed
But a candlea candle made from taller of our own raisingleamed
in Betsys room it gleamed for I All was still The sweet silver
moon was a shinin bright and the beautiful stars was up to their
usual doins I felt a sentymental mood so gently ore me stealin
and I pawsed before Betsys window and sung in a kind of opratic
vois as follers impromtoo to wit

 Wake Bessy wake
 My sweet galoot
 Rise up fair lady
 While I touch my lute

The winderI regret to say that the winder went up with a vilent
crash and a form robed in spotless white exclaimed Cum into the
house you old fool Tomorrer youll be goin round complainin
about your liver

I sot up a spell by the kitchen fire readin Lewis Napoleons Life
of Julius Caesar What a reckless old cuss he was Yit Lewis
picturs him in glowin cullers Caesar made it lively for the boys
in Gaul didnt he He slewd one million of citizens male and
femaleGauls and Gaulussesand then he sold another million of em
into slavery He continnered this cheerful stile of thing for sum
time when one day he was sassinated in Rome by sum hightoned
Roman genlmen led on by Mr Brutus When old Bruty inserted his
knife into him Caesar admitted that he was gone up His funeral
was a great success the house bein crowded to its utmost capacity
Ten minutes after the doors were opened the Ushers had to put up
cards on which was prntd Standin Room Only

I went to bed at last And so I said thou hast no ear for
sweet melody

A silvery snore was my only answer

76 ARTEMUS WARD IN WASHINGTON

The following paper was contributed by Mr Browne to Vanity Fair
the New York Punch which terminated its career during the late
war Some of the allusions are of course to matters long past
but the old fun and genuine humour of the showman are as enjoyable
now as when first written

 Washington April 17 1863

My wife stood before the lookinglass a fussin up her hair

What you doin Betsy I inquired

Doin up my back hair she replied

Betsy said I with a stern air Betsy youre too old to think
about such frivolities as back hair

Too old TOO OLD she screamed too old you baldheded idiot
You aint got hair enuff onto YOUR hed to make a decent wig for a
singlebrested grasshopper

The Rebook was severe but merited Hens4th I shall let my wifes
back hair alone You heard me

My little dawter is growin quite rapid and begins to scrootinize
clothin with young men inside of it puthy clost I obsarve too
that she twists pieces of paper round her hair at nights and wont
let me put my arms round her any more for fair Ill muss her Your
mother wasnt fraid Id muss HER when she was your age my child
sed I one day with a sly twinkle into my dark bay eye

No replied my little dawter she probly liked it

You aint going to fool female Young America much You may gamble
on THAT

But all this which happened in Baldinsville a week ago haint
nothin to do with Washington from whither I now write you hopin
the iterms I hereby sends will be exceptable to the GinCocktail of
AmericaI mean the Punch thereof A mild wittikismAW

Washington DC is the Capital of our once happy countryif I
may be allowed to koin a frase The DC stands for Desprit Cusses
a numerosity which abounds here the most of whom persess a Romantic
pashun for gratooitous drinks And in this conjunction I will
relate an incident I notist for several days a large Hearse
standin in front of the principal tavern on Pennsylvany Avenoo
Can you tell me my fair Castillian sed I this mornin to a young
Spaniard from Tipperary who was blackin boots in the washroomcan
you tell me what those Hearse is kept standin out there for

Well you see our Bar bisness is great Youve no idee of the
number of People who drink at our Bar durin a day You see those
Hearse is necessary

I SAW

Standin in front of the tarvuns of Pennsylvany Avenoo is a lot of
miserbul wretchesblack white and ringstrickid and freckled
with long whips in their hands who frowns upon you like the wulture
upon the turtledove the minit you dismerge from hotel They own
yonder fourwheeled startlin curiositys which were used years and
years ago by the fust settlers of Virginny to carry live hogs to
market in The best carriage I saw in the entire collection was
used by Pockyhontas sum two hundred years ago as a goatpen
Becumin so used up that it couldnt hold goats that fair and gentle
savage put it up at auction Subsekently it was used as a hospital
for sick calves then as a hencoop and finally it was put on wheels
and is now doin duty as a hack

I called on Secretary Welles of the Navy You know he is quite a
mariner himself havin once owned a Raft of logs on the Connethycut
river So I put on saler stile and hollered Ahoy shipmet Tip
us yer grapplin irons

Yes yes he sed nervously but mercy on us dont be so noisy

Ay ay my heart But let me sing about how Jack Stokes lost his
gal

 The reason why he couldnt gain her
 Was becoz hes drunken saler

Thats very good indeed said the Secky but this is hardly the
place to sing songs in my frend

Let me write the songs of a nashun sed I and I dont care a
cuss who goes to the legislater But I ax your pardonhows
things

Comfortable I thank you I have here he added a copy of the
Middletown Weekly Clarion of February the 15 containin a report
that there isnt much Union sentiment in South Caroliny but I
hardly credit it

Air you well Mr Secky sed I Is your liver all right Hows
your koff

God bless me sed the Secky risin hastily and glarin wildly at
me what do you mean

Oh nothin partickler Only it is one of the beauties of a
Republican form of govment that a Cabnet offisser can pack up his
trunk and go home whenever hes sick Sure nothin dont ail your
liver sed I pokin him putty vilent in the stummick

I called on Abe He received me kindly I handed him my umbreller
and told him Id have a check for it if he pleased That sed he
puts me in mind of a little story There was a man out in our
parts who was so mean that he took his wifes coffin out of the back
winder for fear he would rub the paint off the doorway Wall about
this time there was a man in a adjacent town who had a green cotton
umbreller

Did it fit him well Was it custom made Was he measured for it

Measured for what said Abe

The umbreller

Wall as I was sayin continnered the President treatin the
interruption with apparent comtempt this man sed hed known that
there umbreller ever since it was a pyrasol Ha ha ha

Yes said I larfin in a respectful manner but what has this man
with the umbreller to do with the man who took his wifes coffin out
of the back winder

To be sure said Abewhat was it I must have got two stories
mixed together which puts me in mind of another lit

Never mind Your Excellency I called to congratulate you on your
career which has been a honest and a good oneunscared and unmoved
by Secesh in front of you and Abbolish at the back of youeach one
of which is a little wuss than the other if possible

Tell E Stanton that his boldness honesty and vigger merits all
praise but to keep his undergarments on E Stanton has
appeerently only one weakness which it is he cant allus keep his
undergarments from flyin up over his hed I mean that he
occasionally dances in a peckmeasure and he dont look graceful at
it

I took my departer Goodbye old sweetness sed Abe shakin me
cordgully by the hand

Adoo my Prahayrie flower I replied and made my exit
Twentyfive thousand dollars a year and found I soliloquized as
I walked down the street is putty good wages for a man with a
modist appytite but I reckon that it is wuth it to run the White
House

What you bowt sah What the debble you doin sah

It was the voice of an Afrikin Brother which thus spoke to me
There was a cullud procession before me which was escortin a elderly
baldhedded Afrikin to his home in Bates Alley This distinguished
Afrikin Brother had just returned from Lybery and in turnin a
corner puty suddent I hed stumbled and placed my hed agin his
stummick in a rather strengthy manner

Do you wish to impede the progress of this procession sah

Certainly not by all means Procesh

And they went on

Im reconstructing my show Ive bot a collection of life size wax
figgers of our prominent Revolutionary forefathers I bot em at
auction and got em cheap They stand me about two dollars and
fifty cents 2 dols 50 cents per Revolutionary forefather

Ever as always yours

77 SCENES OUTSIDE THE FAIR GROUNDS

There is some fun outside the Fair Ground Any number of
mountebanks have pitched their tents there and are exhibiting all
sorts of monstrosities to large and enthusiastic audiences There
are some eloquent men among the showmen Some of them are
Demosthenic We looked around among them during the last day we
honored the Fair with our brilliant presence and were rather
pleased at some things we heard and witnessed

The man with the fat woman and the little woman and the little man
was there

Eres a show now said he worth seeing Eres a
entertainment that improves the morals PT Barnumyouve all
hearn o him What did he say to me Sez he to me sez PT
Barnum Sir you have the allfiredest best show travelinand
all to be seen for the small sum of fifteen cents

The man with the blue hog was there Says he GentleMEN this
beast cant turn round in a crockery crate ten feet square and is
of a bright indigo blue Over five hundred persons have seen this
wonderful BEING this mornin and they said as they come out What
can these ere things be Is it alive Doth it breathe and have a
being Ah yes they say it is true and we have saw a
entertainment as we never saw afore Tis natures only fifteen
centseres your change sir own sublime handworksand walk
right in

The man with the wild mare was there

Now then my friends is your time to see the gerratist
queeriosity in the livin worlda wild mare without no hair
captered on the roarin wild prahayries of the far distant West by
sixteen Injuns Dont fail to see this gerrate exhibition Only
fifteen cents Dont go hum without seein the State Fair an you
wont see the State Fair without you see my show Gerratist
exhibition in the known world an all for the small sum of fifteen
cents

Two gentlemen connected with the press here walked up and asked the
showman in a still small voice if he extended the usual courtesies
to editors He said he did and requested them to go in While
they were in some sly dog told him their names When they came out
the showman pretended to talk with them though he didnt say a
word They were evidently in a hurry

There gentleMEN what do you think them gentlemen say They air
editorseditors gentleMENMr  of the Cleveland  and Mr
 of the Detroit  and they say it is the gerratist show they
ever seed in their born days

Nothing but the tip ends of the editors coattails could be seen
when the showman concluded this speech

A smartlooking chap was doing a brisk business with a gambling
contrivance Seeing two policemen approach he rapidly and
ingeniously covered the dice up mounted his table and shouted

Eres the only great show on the grounds The highly trained and
performing Mud Turtle with nine heads and seventeen tails captured
in a wellfortified hencoop after a desperate struggle in the
lowlands of the Wabash

The facetious wretch escaped

A grave ministeriallooking and elderly man in a white choker had a
giftenterprise concern My friends he solemnly said you will
observe that this jewellery is elegant indeed but I can afford to
give it away as I have a twin brother seven years older than I am
in New York City who steals it a great deal faster than I can give
it away No blanks my friendsall prizesand only fifty cents a
chance I dont make anything myself my friendsall I get goes to
aid a sick womanmy aunt in the country gentlemenand besides I
like to see folks enjoy themselves

The old scamp said all this with a perfectly grave countenance

The man with the wonderful calf with five legs and a huming head
and the philosophical lungtester were there Then there was the
Flying Circus and any number of other ingenious contrivances to
relieve young ladies and gentlemen from the rural districts of their
spare change

A young man was bitterly bewailing the loss of his watch which had
been cut from his pocket by some thief

You aint smart said a middleaged individual in a dingy Kossuth
hat with a feather in it and who had a very youcantfoolme look
Ive been to the State Fair before I want yer to understan and
knows my bizniss aboard a propeller Heres MY money he
exultingly cried slapping his pantaloons pocket

About half an hour after this we saw this smart individual rushing
frantically around after a policeman Somebody had adroitly
relieved him of HIS money In his search for a policeman he
encountered the young man who wasnt smart

Haw haw haw violently laughed the latter by G I thought
you was smartI thought youd been to the State Fair before

The smart man looked sad for a moment but a knowing smile soon
crossed his face and drawing the young man who wasnt smart
confidentially toward him said

There wasnt only fifteen cents in coppers in my pocketmy MONEY
is in my bootthey cant fool meIVE BEEN TO THE STATE FAIR
BEFORE

78 THE WIFE

 Home they brought her warrior dead
 She nor swooned nor uttered cry
 All her maidens watching said
 She must weep or she will die

The propriety of introducing a sad story like the following in a
book intended to be rather cheerful in its character may be
questioned but it so beautifully illustrates the firmness of woman
when grief and despair have taken possession of the chambers of her
heart that we cannot refrain from relating it

Lucy M loved with all the ardor of a fond and faithful wife and
when he upon whom she had so confidingly leaned was stolen from her

to look upon and yet so firmlooking for the last time upon the
dear familiar face now cold and still in deathoh looking for the
last last timeshe rapidly put on her bonnet and thus addressed
the sobbing gentlemen who were to act as pallbearersYou

711 EAST SIDE THEATRICALS

The Broadway houses have given the public immense quantities of
Central Park Seven Sisters Nancy Sykes and J Cade I suppose
the Broadway houses have done this chiefly because it has paid them
and so I mean no disrespect when I state that to me the thing became
rather stale I sighed for novelty A man may stand stewed veal
for several years but banquets consisting exclusively of stewed
veal would become uninteresting after a century or so A man would
want something else The least particular man it seems to me
would desire to have his veal biled by way of a change So I
tired of the threadbare pieces at the Broadway houses went to the
East Side for something fresh I wanted to see some libertines and
brigands I wanted to see some cheerful persons identified with the
blacksmith and sewingmachine interests triumph over those
libertines and brigands in the most signal manner I wanted in
short to see the Downfall of Vice and Triumph of Virtue That was
what ailed me And so I went to the East Side

Poor Jack Scott is gone and Jo Kirby dies no more on the East
Side Theyve got the blood and things over there but alas
theyre deficient in lungs The tragedians in the Bowery and
Chatham Street of today dont start the shingles on the roof as
their predecessors now cold and stiff in death used to when they
threw themselves upon their knees at the footlights and roared a
redhot curse after the lord who had carried Susan away swearing to
never more eat nor drink until the lords vile heart was torn from
his body and therrown to the dorgsrattling their knives against
the tin lamps and glaring upon the third tier most fearfully the
while

Glancing at the spot where it is said Senator Benjamin used to vend
secondhand clothes and regretting that he had not continued in
that comparatively honorable vocation instead of sinking to his
present positionwondering if Jo Kirby would ever consent if he
were alive to die wrapped up in a Secession flaggazing
admiringly upon the unostentatious signboard which is suspended in
front of the Hon Izzy Lazaruss tavernglancing wondering and
gazing thus I enter the old Chatham theatre The pit is full but
people fight shy of the boxes

The play is about a servant girl who comes to the metropolis from
the agricultural districts in short skirts speckled hose and a
dashing little white hat gaily decked with pretty pink ribbons
that being the style of dress invariably worn by servant girls
from the interior She is accompanied by a chaste young man in a
shorttailed red coat who being very desirous of protecting her
from the temptations of a large city naturally leaves her in the
street and goes off somewhere Servant girl encounters an elderly
female who seems to be a very nice sort of person indeed but the
young man in a shorttailed coat comes in and thrusts the elderly
female aside calling her a vile hag This pleases the pit
which is ever true to virtue and it accordingly cries Hi hi hi

A robber appears The idea of a robber in times like these is
rather absurd The most adroit robber would eke out a miserable
subsistence if he attempted to follow his profession nowadays I
should prefer to publish a daily paper in Chelsea Nevertheless
here is a robber He has been playing poker with his dupe but
singularly enough the dupe has won all the money This displeases
the robber and it occurs to him that he will kill the dupe He
accordingly sticks him The dupe staggers falls says Dearest
Eliza and dies Cries of Hi hi hi in the pit while a
gentleman with a weed on his hat in the boxes states that the
price of green smelts is five cents a quart This announcement is
not favorably received by the pit several members of which come
back at the weeded individual with some advice in regard to
liquidating a longstanding account for beans and other refreshments
at an adjacent restaurant

The robber is seized with remorse and says the money which he has
taken from the dupes pockets scorches him Robber seeks refuge
in a misers drawingroom where he stays for seven days There
is a long chest full of money and diamonds in the room The chest
is unlocked but misers very frequently go off and leave long chests
full of money unlocked in their drawingrooms for seven days and
this robber was too much of a gentleman to take advantage of this
particular misers absence By and by the miser returns when the
robber quietly kills him and chucks him in the chest Sleep with
your gold old man says the bold robber as he melodramatically
retreatsretreats to a cellar where the servant girl resides
Finds that she was formerly his gal when he resided in the rural
districts and regrets having killed so many persons for if so be
he hadnt he might marry her and settle down whereas now he cant
do it as he says he is unhappy But he gives her a ringa ring
he has stolen from the dupeand flies Presently the dupe who has
come to life in a singular but eminently theatrical manner is
brought into the cellar He discovers the ring upon the servant
girls fingerservant girl states that she is innocent and the
dupe with the remark that he sees his mother dies this time
positively without reserve Servant girl is taken to Newgate
whither goes the robber and gains admission by informing the turnkey
that he is her uncle Throws off his disguise and like a robber
bold and gay says he is the guilty party and will save the servant
girl He drinks a vial of poison says he sees HIS mother and dies
to slow fiddling Servant girl throws herself upon him wildly and
the virtuous young party in a shorttailed coat comes in and assists
in the tableau Robber tells the servant girl to take the party in
the shorttailed coat and be happy repeats that he sees his mother
they always do and dies again Cries of Hi hi hi and the
weeded gentleman reiterates the price of green smelts

Not a remarkably heavy plot but quite as bulky as the plots of the
Broadway sensation pieces

712 SOLILOQUY OF A LOW THIEF

My name is Jim Griggins Im a low thief My parients was ignorant
folks and as poor as the shadder of a bean pole My advantages for
gettin a eddycation was exceedin limited I growed up in the
street quite loose and permiskis you see and took to vice because
I had nothing else to take to and because nobody had never given me
a sight at virtue

Im in the penitentiary I was sent here onct before for priggin a
watch I served out my time and now Im here agin this time for
stealin a few insignificant clothes

I shall always blame my parients for not eddycatin me Had I been
liberally eddycated I could with my brilliant native talents have
bin a big thiefI bleeve they call em defaulters Instead of
confinin myself to priggin clothes watches spoons and sich
like I could have plundered princely sumsthousands and hundreds
of thousands of dollarsand that old humbug the Law wouldnt have
harmed a hair of my head For you see I should be smart enough to
get elected State Treasurer or have something to do with Banks or
Railroads and perhaps a little of both Then you see I could
ride in my carriage live in a big house with a free stun frunt
drive a fast team and drink as much gin and sugar as I wanted A
inwestigation might be made and some of the noospapers might come
down on me heavy but what the dl would I care about that
havin previously taken precious good care of the stolen money
Besides my party would swear stout that I was as innersunt as the
newborn babe and a great many people would wink very pleasant and
say Well Griggins understands what HES bout HE does

But havin no eddycation Im only a low thiefa stealer of watches
and spoons and sicha low wretch anyhowand the Law puts me
through without mercy

Its all right I spose and yet I sometimes think its wery hard to
be shut up here a wearin checkered clothes a livin on cold
vittles a sleepin on iron beds a lookin out upon the world
through iron muskeeter bars and poundin stun like a galley slave
day after day week after week and year after year while my
brother thieves for to speak candid theres no difference between
a thief and a defaulter except that the latter is forty times
wuss who have stolen thousands of dollars to my one cent are
walkin out there in the bright sunshinedressed up to kill new
clothes upon their backs and piles of gold in their pockets But
the Law dont tech em They are too big game for the Law to shoot
at Its as much as the Law can do to take care of us ignorant
thieves

Who said there was no difference tween tweedledum and tweedledee
He lied in his throat like a villain as he was I tell ye theres
a tremendous difference

Oh that I had been liberally eddycated

713 THE NEGRO QUESTION

I was sitting in the bar quietly smokin a frugal pipe when two
middleaged and sternlooking females and a young and pretty female
suddenly entered the room They were accompanied by two umberellers
and a negro gentleman

Do you feel for the downtrodden said one of the females a
thinfaced and sharpvoiced person in green spectacles

Do I feel for it ansered the lanlord in a puzzled voice do
I feel for it

Yes for the oppressed the benighted

Inasmuch as to which said the lanlord

You see this man said the female pintin her umbreller at the
negro gentleman

Yes marm I see him

Yes said the female raisin her voice to a exceedin high pitch
you see him and hes your brother

No Im darned if he is said the lanlord hastily retreating to
his beercasks

And yours shouted the excited female addressing me He is also
your brother

No I think not marm I pleasantly replied The nearest we come
to that color in our family was the case of my brother John He had
the janders for sevral years but they finally left him I am
happy to state that at the present time he hasnt a solitary
jander

Look at this man screamed the female

I looked at him He was an ablebodied welldressed
comfortablelooking negro He looked as though he might heave three
or four good meals a day into him without a murmur

Look a that downtrodden man cried the female

Who trod on him I inquired

Villains despots

Well said the lanlord why dont you go to the willins about
it Why do you come here tellin us niggers is our brothers and
brandishin your umbrellers round us like a lot of lunytics Youre
wuss than the sperritrappers

Have you said middleaged female No 2 who was a quieter sort of
person have you no sentimentno poetry in your soulno love for
the beautiful Dost never go into the green fields to cull the
beautiful flowers

I not only never dost said the landlord in an angry voice but
Ill bet you five pound you cant bring a man as dares say I durst

The little birds continued the female dost not love to gaze
onto them

I would I were a bird that I might fly to thou I humorously
sung casting a sweet glance at the pretty young woman

Dont you look in that way at my dawter said female No 1 in a
violent voice youre old enough to be her father

Twas an innocent look dear madam I softly said You behold in
me an emblem of innocence and purity In fact I start for Rome by
the first train tomorrow to sit as a model to a celebrated artist
who is about to sculp a statue to be called Sweet Innocence Do you
spose a sculper would send for me for that purpose onless he knowd
I was overflowing with innocency Dont make a error about me

It is my opinyn said the leading female that youre a scoffer
and a wretch Your mind is in a wusser beclouded state than the
poor nergoes we are seeking to aid You are a groper in the dark
cellar of sin O sinful man

 There is a sparkling fount
 Come O come and drink

No you will not come and drink

Yes he will said the landlord if youll treat Jest try him

As for you said the enraged female to the landlord youre a
degraded bein too low and wulgar to talk to

This is the sparklin fount for me dear sister cried the
lanlord drawin and drinkin a mug of beer Having uttered which
goak he gave a low rumblin larf and relapsed into silence

My colored fren I said to the negro kindly what is it all
about

He said they was trying to raise money to send missionaries to the
Southern States in America to preach to the vast numbers of negroes
recently made free there He said they were without the gospel
They were without tracts

I said My fren this is a seris matter I admire you for trying
to help the race to which you belong and far be it from me to say
anything again carrying the gospel among the blacks of the South
Let them go to them by all means But I happen to individually know
that there are some thousands of liberated blacks in the South who
are starvin I dont blame anybody for this but it is a very sad
fact Some are really too ill to work some cant get work to do
and others are too foolish to see any necessity for workin I was
down there last winter and I observed that this class had plenty of
preachin for their souls but skurce any vittles for their stummux
Now if it is proposed to send flour and bacon along with the
gospel the idea is really an excellent one If on tother hand
it is proposed to send preachin alone all I can say is that its a
hard case for the niggers If you expect a colored person to get
deeply interested in a tract when his stummuck is empty you expect
too much

I gave the negro as much as I could afford and the kindhearted
lanlord did the same I said

Farewell my colored fren I wish you well certainly You are now
as free as the eagle Be like him and soar But dont attempt to
convert a Ethiopian person while his stummuck yearns for vittles
And you ladiesI hope you are ready to help the poor and
unfortunate at home as you seem to help the poor and unfortunate
abroad

When they had gone the lanlord said Come into the garden Ward
And we went and culled some carrots for dinner

714 ARTEMUS WARD ON HEALTH


The following fragment from the pen of Artemus Ward was written in
the last days of his illness and was found amongst the loose papers
on the table beside his bed It contains the last written jests of
the dying jester and is illustrative of that strong spirit of humor
which even extreme exhaustion and the near approach of death itself
could not wholly destroy

There is an anecdote related of Thomas Hood to the effect that when
he was just upon the point of dying his friend Mr FO WARD
visited him and to amuse him related some of his adventures in
the low parts of the metropolis in his capacity as a sanitary
commissioner Pray desist said Hood your anecdote gives me the
backslumbago The proximity of death could no more deprive poor
Artemus of his power to jest than it could Thomas Hood When
nothing else was left him to joke upon when he could no longer seek
fun in the city streets or visit the Tower of London and call it a
sweet boon his own shattered self suggested a theme for jesting
He commenced this paper On Health The purport of it I believe
was to ridicule doctors generally for Artemus was bitterly
sarcastic on his medical attendants and he had some good reasons
for being so A few weeks before he died a German physician
examined his throat with a laryngoscope and told him that nothing
was the matter with him except a slight inflammation of the larynx
Another physician told him that he had heart disease and a third
assured him that he merely required his throat to be sponged two or
three times a day and take a preparation of tortoise shell for
medicine to perfectly recover Every doctor made a different
diagnosis and each had a different specific One alone of the many
physicians to whom Artemus applied seemed to be fully aware that the
poor patient was dying of consumption in its most formidable form
Not merely phthisis but a cessation of functions and a wasting away
of the organs most concerned in the vital processes Artemus saw
how much the doctors were at fault and used to smile at them with a
sadly scornful smile as they left the sick room I must write a
paper said he about health and doctors The few paragraphs
which follow are I believe all that he wrote on the subject
Whether the matter became too serious to him for further jesting or
whether his hand became too weak to hold the pen I cannot say The
article terminates as abruptly as did the life of its gentle kind
illfated author

EPH

Ontil quite recent Ive bin a helthy individooal Im near 60 and
yit Ive got a muskle into my arms which dont make my fists
resemble the tread of a canary bird when they fly out and hit a man

Only a few weeks ago I was exhibitin in East Skowhegan in a bildin
which had formly bin ockepyied by a pugylistone of them fellers
which hits from the shoulder and teaches the manly art of self
defens And he cum and said he was goin in free in consekence of
previsly ockepyin sed bildin with a large yeller dog I sed To
be sure sir but not with those yeller dogs He sed Oh yes
I sed Oh no He sed Do you want to be ground to powder I
sed Yes I do if there is a powdergrindist handy When he
struck me a disgustin blow in my left eye which caused that concern
to at once close for repairs but he didnt hurt me any more I
went for him I went for him energetcally His parents live near
by and I will simply state that 15 minits after Id gone for him
his mother seein the prostrate form of her son approachin the house
on to a shutter carrid by four men run out doors keerfully looked
him over and sed My son youve been foolin round a thrashin
masheen You went in at the end where they put the grain in come
out with the straw and then got up in the thingumajig and let the
hosses tred on you didnt you my son

You can jedge by this what a disagreeable person I am when Im
angry

But to resoom about helth I cum of a helthy famly

The Wards has allus been noted for helthiness

The fust of my ancestors that I know anything about was Abijah Ward
and his wife Abygil Ward who came over with the Pilgrims in the
Mayflower Most of the Pilgrims was sick on the passige but my
ancestor wasnt Even when the tempist raged and the billers
howled he sold another Pilgrim a kag of apple sass The Pilgrim
who bot it was angry when he found that under a few layers of sass
the rest was sawdust and my ancestor sed he wouldnt have bleeved
such wickedness could exist when he ascertained that the bill sed
Pilgrim gave him was onto a broken bank and wasnt wuth the price
of a glass of new gin It will be thus seen that my fust ancestor
had a commercial mind

My ancestors has all bin helthy people tho their pursoots in life
has been varis

     

     

715 A FRAGMENT

Among the papers letters and miscellanea left on the table of poor
Ward was found the fragment which follows Diligent search failed
to discover any beginning or end to it The probability is that it
consists of part of a paper intended to describe a comic trip round
England To write a comic itinerary of an English tour was one of
the authors favorite ideas and another favorite one was to travel
on the Continent and compile a comic Murrays Guide No interest
attaches to this mere scrap other than that it exemplifies what the
writer would have attempted had his life been longer

     

At North Berwick there was a maniacal stampede toward the little
house by the railside where they sell such immense quantities of
spongecake which is very sweet and very yellow but which lies
rather more heavily on the stomach than raw turnips as I
ascertained one day from actual experience This is not stated
because I have any spite against this little house by the railside
Their mincepies are nobly made and their applepies are
unsurpassed Some years ago there used to be a very pretty girl at
this house and one day while I was struggling rapidly with a piece
of mincepie I was so unfortunate as to wink slightly at her The
rash act was discovered by a yellowhaired party who stated that
she was to be his wife ere long and that he expected he could
lick any party who winked at her A cursory examination of his
frame convinced me that he could lick me with disgustin ease so I
told him it was a complaint of the eyes They are both so I
added and they have been so from infancys hour See here And
I commenced winking in a frightful manner I escaped but it was
inconvenient for me for some time afterwards because whenever I
passed over the road I naturally visited the refreshment house and
was compelled to wink in a manner which took away the appetites of
other travellers and one day caused a very old lady to state with
her mouth full of spongecake that she had cripples and drunkards
in her family but thanks to the heavens above no idiots without
any control over their eyes looking sternly at me as she spoke

That was years ago Besides the wink was a pure accident I trust
that my unblemished characterbut I will not detain you further
with this sad affair

720 THE BABES IN THE WOOD

The following amusing critique or report of Artemus Wards favourite
lecture entitled The Babes in the wood was written the day after
its first delivery in San Francisco California by one of the
contributors to the Golden Era As an imitation of A Wards
burlesque orthography it is somewhat overdone but it has
nevertheless certain touches of humour which will amuse the English
reader Why the lecture is called The Babes in the Wood is not
known unless it is because they are WARDS  ED

Nite befoar larst was an Erer in the annals of Sand Francisco yis
an Erer I sa it and I guess I know what a Erer is I gess I do
Its something like this noosepaper for instance something thats
gut a big Injin onto it though the Big Injin Fryday Nite had his
close on which this moril Jernals Injin hasnt bein intended to
represent that nobil read man of the forrist of hoom the poet
sweetly sings

 Low the poor Injin hoose untootered mind
 Clothes him in fruntButt leaves him bare behind

However let that parse

I hearn thare was to be a show up to Mr Platts Haul on the occashun
allewded to so I took Maria An an the childrenwith the excepshun

sweet restorer Missis Winslows Soothin Syrup was rapped in barmy
slumbersup to prayer meetin and after havin excoosed myself to the
pardner of my boosom on the plee of havin swallered a boks of
Bristols SugarCoated Pills I slipt out and went down to the Haul
thinkin I would have a little relaxation Prubably Mariar An thought
so too That are a double entender but I didnt intend it
Although I arrove quite airly I found a few Individools I mean to sa
I found but few who ware notalready in the Haul I would not on no

The curtin rozeno I do not desire to misrepresent faxthere was
no curtinI think thare should have bin

The lectoor commenced at a few minutes past ateprecisely The gay
and gifted Artemus stepped to his place and after acknowledging my
presence by a polite bow prooeeded to define the platform on which
he stoodOregon pine The papers with thare usuil fidelity to fax
had stated that the entertainment would consist only of a lectoor 
that the kangaroo  waxfiggers would not be introdooceddooced
queer thinks I and I soon discovered the telegram for Mr Ward
used a number of figgersof speech

Thare ware also severeil animils thare thare was tho I dont know
whether they belonged to him as they was scattered thro the

Some of the funniest of the fundymentall principles of the lectoor

Mr Ward statid that he would not give a fillosoffical lectoornor an

give The subjec was however the Babes in the Wood He has had

721 MR WARD ATTENDS A GRAFFICK SOIREE

Shortly after the publication in this country of Artemus Ward His
Book I received from a friend the following article purporting to
have been written by Mr W during a stay in Bristol The sketch
appeared in the Bristol Record and upon writing to the editor for
further information concerning it I received from that gentleman
such a cautious reply as confirmed a previous suspicion that the
showman had not visited the great western city and that the article
was either a concoction in Mr Wards style or one of the papers of
Josh Billings an imitator of Mr W slightly altered to suit the
locality of its republication Whether these conjectures are correct
or not the article is here given for the English readers criticism
and although not equal in humour to A Wards more successful
pieces certain pleasantries of expression and droll extravagances
observable in it will at least repay perusal

Prefixed to the article in the Record was the following A letter
has just been shown to us of which we subjoin a portion from which
it will appear that Mr  we suppress the name for obvious reasons
is not the only illustrious American who is sojourning at present at
Clifton Artemus Ward has retired for the present from his
professional duties in consequence of the rough treatment which he
lately received in the Southern States His admirers have sent him
to England to recruit and he was last week at Clifton and dined
with Mr  We are violating no literary confidence in mentioning
the above as Mr Ward is combining business with pleasure and his

WALL we had a just sittled down to our wine when sez the Squire
soddenlick Mr W would you like to go to a Graffick

fashionables of this interestin location there

Dont care if I duz sed I perwided u go the Ticket

Sertingly sed he Mr Ward you are my guest for the evening

So we put on our gotomeetings and yaller kidskins and sot off
There was a purty tidy fixin of shrubs and statooary as we went in
but nuthin ekal to the Bowery Saloon New York and stairs up and
stairs down and gals in opera clokes ascendin and Dscendin

First we go up into a big room with a blaze o lite and a crowd of
cumpany The Squire whispers to me and sez hell pint out the
lokial celebrities At the end of the room is a great pictur
representin a stout femail on a tarnation dark background The
critters scrowded up to it and looked on in hor Presently I feels
the Squire nudging me

Do you see that individooal sed he with Hyacinthian curls and
his eye in a fine frenzy rollin Thats the great art critic who
lays down the lor for Bristol and ets vicinity

So I pushed up cloas and sed I to the creteck Wall Mister what
dew think of that air piece of canvas staining

At first he Ide me loftily and made no reply At last he spoak
with grate deliberashun Not yet have I mastered the pictur Im
a studyin of the onperfectlyseen vizionoimies behind Them guards
is a phernomenon The soul of the painter has projected itself
thrugh the august glooms

Dont see it sez I Them shadders want glazinand the
middletints is no whur Guess if Hiram Applesquash our domestic
decorator to hum had pertrayed them guards he would hev slicked
off their Uniforms as bright as a New England tulip

The creteck regarded me With Contemptoous indignashun

Hullo sed I next whose been and stolen a signboard and stuck
it up in this refined society

To what do you defer sez he still very fridgid

To that corpulent figgur sez I in military fixins

That sair sez he with severity is a portrait of his Majusty
the King of Denmark lately disEased

A portraickt of his cloze you mean sez I Is that sprorling
pictur a work of art NBThis I sed sarcasticul Hiram A
touched off a new Sign for the Tavern at Baldinsville jest before
I saled and his Presidents Head would bete this by a long chalk
any day With that I scowled at the Creteck and left him looking
considerable smawl pertaters

Arter this we went down into the Colehole wich they had cleaned
out for the night and whitewashed Here I own was buties of natur
I always had a liken for watercolar paintin and sometimes take a
sketcht in that way myself Me and Squire tried to get a good look
but was engulphed in an oshun of hot galls who kinder steamed again
The gas close over our heads nigh made our brains bile over so
sez I Lets make tracks out of this Squire It aint civet
Schakspar here This parfume of humanity is horrid unhandsome

Lets have a cup of corfy says he to repare exhorsted natur

A sherry cobbler would be more to the purpose says I but if they
hev none of them coolin drinks at art sworricks here goes for the
Moky NBThis I sed ironical Korfy at sworricks is usually
burnt beans

So we med our way into another room with 2 barcounters and a crowd
of people pushin and drivin to get forrerd They knocked and elbered
me about till I felt my dander riz Come on Squire sez I
setting my arms a kimber take care my old coons of your tendur
Korns and Bunyans Look out for your ribs for Ive crooked my
elbers and forrerd I goes with Squire follerin in my wake Bimeby
a womans long skirt gets between my legs and I spins round and goes
kerslash into the stumuck of a fat old gentleman who was just blowin
his third cup He med a spaired his breath though kerslap I goes
into his wastecote and kesouse goes his coffy over his shoulders
onto hed and neck of a bony old made with a bird of Pardice in her
artificial locks

Beg your pardon marm sez I as soon as I could speak

She looked imprekashuns and turned away ortily mopping herself down
with a laced noserag

The Old gentleman was more cholerick Cuss your clumsiness says
he cant you come to a graffick without punching your ugly hed Into
other peoples stumucks

I didnt go for to do it sez I and jest put the Sadll on the
right hoss mister I continerred If this femail behind didnt
carry so much slack foresail she wuddnt hev entangled my spars and
careened me over

Arter this I would try no more of their allfired corfy Squire
had had enough of the Sworrick so we made tracks for the Hotell

Bringup a quart of brandy sez the Squire and a bilin o lemons
and sugar Mr W sez he theres not much of me left Lets
liquor up Lets have a smoke and a cocktail So we mixes and
had an entertaining discorse on polite literatoor Dodrabbit the
sworrick says Squire Say no more about it I was a fool Mr
Ward to prefare it to your amusin an inshstructive conversashun

After a while we got cheerful and sung ale Columby its a fine
voice the Squire has for a dooet Respect for the soshul Borde
makes me now cave in and klose my commoonication Squire  is a
grate filantherpist but hes not grate at stowing away his licker
I tuk him to bed after the 3d tumbler that the cuss of a british
Waiter might not see one of us free  enlightened citizens onable to
walk strate He said it was a wet night and demanded his umburella
Likewise he wouldnt hev his boots off for fere of catchin cold I
put the candle in the washbasan that the critter mightnt set
hisself on fire and left him in bed with his umburella up singing
Ale columby

Arter that I went down and finished the mahogany Brandy and water
the ruddy appearance of which indicates that very little of the
latter has been used in its composition Spanish is the stronger
and Honduras the milder mixture

 A WARD

722 A WARD AMONG THE MORMONSREPORTED BY HIMSELFOR SOMEBODY
ELSE

The following rough report of Artemus Wards Lecture in California
Appeared in the San Francisco Era during the lecturers visit to
that city It has been thought worthy of preservation in the form
of a supplementary paper to the present little volume

FELLERCITIZENS AND FELLERCITIZENESSESI feel truly glad to see
you here tonight more especially those who have paid although I am
too polite to say how many are here who have not paid but who take a
base advantage of the goodnature of my friend and manager Hingston
bothering him to give them free tickets gratis and also for
nothing and my former friend and manager Rosenberg assures me that
the best way to prevent a person from enjoying any entertainment is
to admit them without the equivalent spondulics What a man gets for
nothing he dont care for

Talking of free tickets my first lecture was a wonderful success
house so full that everybody who could pay turned from the doors It
happened thus

Walking about Salt Lake City on the morning before the lecture I met
Elder Kimball Well I most imprudently gave him a family ticket
That ticket filled the house and left about a dozen of the young
Kimballs howling in the cold After that I limited my family tickets
to Admit Elder Jones ten wives and thirty children

You may perhaps be astonished that I a rather fascinating bachelor
escaped from Salt Lake City without the loss of my innocence Well I
will confess confidentially that was only by the skin of my teeth
and thanks to the virtuous lecturing of my friend Hingston whose
British prejudices amainst Bigamy Trigamy and Brighamy saying
nothing of Ninnygavigamy could not be overcome

My narrowest escape was this

About six hours before I arrived an elder died I think his name
was Smith You may have heard that name before but it isnt the
Smith you knowit is quite another Smith Well this defunct elder
left a small assortment of wives behind himI think there were
seventeenof all ages from seventeen to seventy This miscellaneous
gathering included three grandmothers a fact which lent a venerable
sanctity to the affair I received an invitationI wentand was
introduced to the whole seventeen widows at once Sam Weller or Dr
Shelton MackenzieI forget whichsays One widow is dangerous
but perhaps there is safety in a multitude of them All I know is
that they made the tenderest appeals to me as a man and a brother
but I threw myself upon their mercyI told them I was far away from
my parents and my Sainted Maria and that I was a good young man
and finally I begged to know if their intentions were honourable

One said

Young man dash not the cup of happiness from your life

I said

I have no objection to a cup but I cannot stand an entire
hogshead

They grew more and more tendertwo put their arms around me and
pinioned me while the other fifteen drew large shears from their
pockets and under pretence of getting a lock of hair for each
they left me as bare as a gooseegg Indians couldnt have scalped
me closer I made Samsonlike my escape from these Delilahs by
stratagem I assured them that I was sickening for the measles
which like love is always the more fatal the later it comes in
life I also told them that my friend Hingston was a much better
looking man than I was also that he was an Englishman and that
according to that nations creed every Englishman is equal to five
Americans and five hundred Frenchmen consequently there would be
some to spare of him This happy thought saved me I was let off
upon solemnly promising to deliver Hingston into their arms bound
Laocoonlike by the serpent spells of their charms or like
Regulus potted and preserved in a barrel of fingernails for their
especial scratching

Hingston little dreaming of the sale I had made of him went on the
pretended errand of conveying to these seventeen beauties a farewell
bouquet Poor fellow that is the last I ever saw of himhe was
never heard of again

The gentleman who acts as my manager is somebody else I must ask
the indulgence of the audience for twenty minutes while I drop a few
tears to his memory Here Artemus holds his head over a barrel and
the distinct dripping of a copious shower is heard

As I feel a little better I will recommence my lectureI dont mean
to defend Mormonismindeed I have no hesitation in affirming and I
affirm it boldly and I would repeat the observation to my own wifes
face if I had one but as I havent one Ill say it boldly to every
other mans wife that I dont think it wise to marry more than one
wife at a time without it is done to oblige the ladies and then it
should be done sparingly and not oftener than three times a day for
the marriage ceremony isnt lightly to be repeated But I want to
tell you what Brigham Young observed to me

Artemus my boy said he you dont know how often a man marries
against his will Let me recite one case out of a hundred that has
happened to myself About three months ago a family arrived here
they were from Hobokeneverybody knows how beautiful the Jersey
girls arewith the exception of applejack they are the nicest
things Jersey produces Well this family consisted of four
daughters a mother and two grandmothers one with teeth the other
without I took a fancy to the youngest of the girls and proposed
After considerable reflection she said I cant think of marrying
you without you marry my three sisters as well

After some considerable hesitation I agreed and went to the girls
mother for her consent No objection to your marrying my four girls
but youll have to take me as well After a little reflection I
consented and went to the two grandmothers for their consentNo
objection said the old dames in a breath but youll have to marry
us as well We cannot think of separating the family After a
little cosy hesitation on my part I finally agreed to swallow the
two old venerable antiquities as a sort of sauce to the other five

Under these circumstances who can wonder at Brigham Young being the
most highly married man in the Republic In a word he is too much
marriedindeed if I were he I should say two hundred and too much
married

As I see my esteemed friend Joe Whitton of Niblos Garden sitting
right before me I will give him an anecdote which he will
appreciate There is considerable barter in Salt Lake Cityhorses
and cows are good for hundreddollar greenbacks while pigs dogs
cats babies and pickaxes are the fractional currency I dare say
my friend Joe Whitton would be as much astonished as I was after my
first lecture Seeing a splendid house I naturally began to reckon
my spondulics Full of this Pactolean vision I went into my
treasurers room

Now Hingston my boy let us see what the proceeds are We shall
soon make a fortune at this rate

Hingston with the solemnity of a cashier then read the proceeds of
the lecture

Three cows one with horns and two without but not a stumptail
fourteen pigs alive and grunting seventeen hams sugar cured three
babies in arms two of them cutting their teeth and the other
sickening with the chickencoop or some such disease There were
no end of old hats ladies hoops corsets and another article of
clothing generally stolen from the husband There was also a
secondhand coffin three barrels of turnips and a peck of coals
there was likewise a footless pair of stockings without the legs and
a pair of embroidered gaiters a little worn If I could find the
legs belonging to themwell I wont say what Id do nowbut leave
all ladies in that pleasing state of expectation which is true
happiness Ladies and gentlemen my lecture is doneif you refuse
to leave the hall youll be forcibly ejected
