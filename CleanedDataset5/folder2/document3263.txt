THE PORTYGEE


By Joseph Crosby Lincoln




CHAPTER I


Overhead the clouds cloaked the sky a ragged cloak it was and here
and there a star shone through a hole to be obscured almost instantly
as more cloud tatters were hurled across the rent The pines threshed on
the hill tops The bare branches of the wildcherry and silverleaf trees
scraped and rattled and tossed And the wind the raw chilling December
wind driven in wet and salty from the sea tore over the dunes and
brown uplands and across the frozen saltmeadows screamed through
the telegraph wires and made the platform of the dismal South Harniss
railway station the lonesomest coldest darkest and most miserable spot
on the face of the earth

At least that was the opinion of the seventeenyearold boy whom the
down trainon time for once and a wonderhad just deposited upon that
platform He would not have discounted the statement one iota The South
Harniss station platform WAS the most miserable spot on earth and he was
the most miserable human being upon it And this last was probably true
for there were but three other humans upon that platform and judging by
externals they seemed happy enough One was the station agent who was
just entering the building preparatory to locking up for the night
and the others were Jim Young driver of the depot wagon and Doctor
Holliday the South Harniss homeopath who had been up to a Boston
hospital with a patient and was returning home Jim was whistling
Silver Bells a tune much in vogue the previous summer and Doctor
Holliday was puffing at a cigar and knocking his feet together to keep
them warm while waiting to get into the depot wagon These were the only
people in sight and they were paying no attention whatever to the lonely
figure at the other end of the platform

The boy looked about him The station with its sickly yellow gleam
of kerosene lamp behind its dingy windowpane was apparently the only
inhabited spot in a barren wilderness At the edge of the platform
civilization seemed to end and beyond was nothing but a black earth
and a black sky tossing trees and howling wind and coldraw damp
penetrating cold Compared with this even the stuffy plush seats and
smelly warmth of the car he had just left appeared temptingly homelike
and luxurious All the way down from the city he had sneered inwardly at
a onehorse railroad which ran no Pullmans on its Cape branch in winter
time Now he forgot his longing for mahogany veneer and individual
chairs and would gladly have boarded a freight car provided there were
in it a lamp and a stove

The light in the station was extinguished and the agent came out with
a jingling bunch of keys and locked the door Goodnight Jim
he shouted and walked off into the blackness Jim responded with a
goodnight of his own and climbed aboard the wagon into the dark
interior of which the doctor had preceded him The boy at the other end
of the platform began to be really alarmed It looked as if all living
things were abandoning him and he was to be left marooned to starve or
freeze provided he was not blown away first

He picked up the suitcasean expensive suitcase it was elaborately
strapped and buckled with a telescope back and gold fittingsand
hastened toward the wagon Mr Young had just picked up the reins

Ohoh I say faltered the boy We have called him the boy all
this time but he did not consider himself a boy he esteemed himself
a man if not fullgrown physically certainly so mentally A man
with all a mans wisdom and more besidesthe great the allembracing
wisdom of his age or youth

Here I say Just a minute he repeated Jim Young put his head around
the edge of the wagon curtain Eh he queried Eh Whos talkin Oh
was it you young feller Did you want me

The young fellow replied that he did This is South Harniss isnt it
he asked

Mr Young chuckled Darn sure thing he drawled I give in that it
looks considerble like Boston or Providence R I or some of them
capitols but it aint its South Harniss Cape Cod

Doctor Holliday on the back seat of the depot wagon chuckled Jim
did not he never laughed at his own jokes And his questioner did not
chuckle either

Does adoes a Mr Snow live here he asked

The answer was prompt if rather indefinite Umhm said the driver
No lessn fourteen of him lives here Which one do you want

A Mr Z Snow

Mr Z Snow eh Humph I dont seem to recollect any Mr Z Snow
around nowadays There used to be a Ziba Snow but hes dead Twant
him you wanted was it

No The one I want isis a Captain Snow Captain he paused before
uttering the name which to his critical metropolitan ear had seemed
so dreadfully countrified and humiliating Captain Zelotes Snow he
blurted desperately

Jim Young laughed aloud Good land Doc he cried turning toward his
passenger I swan I clean forgot that Capn Lotes name begun with a
Z Capn Lote Snow Why darn sure I    Eh He stopped short
evidently struck by a new idea Sho he drawled slowly Why
I declare I believe youre    Yes of course I heard they was
expectin you Doc you know who tis dont you Capn Lotes grandson
Janies boy

He took the lighted lantern from under the wagon seat and held it up so
that its glow shone upon the face of the youth standing by the wheel

Hum he mused Dont seem to favor Janie much does he Doc Kind of
got her mouth and chin though Remember that sort of goodlookin set
to her mouth she had And SHE got it from old Capn Lo himself This
boys face must be more like his pas I callate Dont you callate
so Doc

Whether Doctor Holliday callated so or not he did not say It may be
that he thought this cool inspection of and discussion concerning a
stranger even a juvenile stranger somewhat embarrassing to its object
Or the lantern light may have shown him an ominous pucker between the
boys black brows and a flash of temper in the big black eyes beneath
them At any rate instead of replying to Mr Young he said kindly

Yes Captain Snow lives in the village If you are going to his house
get right in here I live close by myself

Darned sure agreed Mr Young with enthusiasm Hop right in sonny

But the boy hesitated Then haughtily ignoring the driver he said I
thought Captain Snow would be here to meet me He wrote that he would

The irrepressible Jim had no idea of remaining ignored Did Capn Lote
write you that hed be here to the depot he demanded All right then
hell be here dont you fret I presume likely that everlastin mare
of his has eat herself sick again eh Doc By godfreys domino the way
they pet and stuff that fool horse is a sin and a shame It aint Lotes
fault so much as tis his wifesshes responsible Dont you fret
Bub the capnll be here for you some time tonight If he said hell
come hell come even if he has to hire one of them limmysines He he
he All youve got to do is wait and    Hey    Hold on a minute
   Bub

The boy was walking away And to hail him as Bub was although Jim
Young did not know it the one way least likely to bring him back

Bub shouted Jim again Receiving no reply he added what he had
intended saying If I run afoul of Capn Lote anywheres on the road
he called Ill tell him youre here awaitin So long Bub Git dap
Chain Lightnin

The horse thus complimented pricked up one ear lifted a foot and
jogged off The depot wagon became merely a shadowy smudge against the
darkness of the night For a few minutes the chock chock of the hoofs
upon the frozen road and the rattle of wheels gave audible evidence of
its progress Then these died away and upon the windswept platform of
the South Harniss station descended the black gloom of lonesomeness
so complete as to make that which had been before seem by comparison
almost cheerful

The youth upon that platform turned up his coat collar thrust his
gloved hands into his pockets and shivered Then still shivering
he took a brisk walk up and down beside the suitcase and finally
circumnavigated the little station The voyage of discovery was
unprofitable there was nothing to discover So far as he could
seewhich was by no means farupon each side of the building was
nothing but bare fields and tossing pines and wind and cold and
blackness He came to anchor once more by the suitcase and drew a long
hopeless breath

He thought of the cheery dining room at the school he had left the day
before Dinner would be nearly over by now The fellows were having
dessert or probably were filing out into the corridors the younger
chaps to go to the study hall and the older onesthe lordly seniors of
whom he had been oneon the way to their rooms The picture of his own
cheerful gay room in the senior corridor was before his mind of that
room as it was before the telegram came before the lawyer came with
the letter before the end of everything as he knew it and the beginning
ofthis He had not always loved and longed for that school as he loved
and longed for it now There had been times when he referred to it as
the old jail and professed to hate it But it had been the only real
home he had known since he was eight years old and now he looked back
upon it as a fallen angel might have looked back upon Paradise He
sighed again choked and hastily drew his gloved hand across his eyes
At the age of seventeen it is very unmanly to cry but at that age
also manhood and boyhood are closely intermingled He choked again
and then squaring his shoulders reached into his coat pocket for the
silver cigarette case which as a recent acquisition was the pride of
his soul He had just succeeded in lighting a cigarette when borne upon
the wind he heard once more the sound of hoofs and wheels and saw in
the distance a speck of light advancing toward the station

The sounds drew nearer so did the light Then an oldfashioned buggy
drawn by a plump little sorrel pulled up by the platform and a hand
held a lantern aloft

Hello hailed a voice Where are you

The hail did not have to be repeated Before the vehicle reached the
station the boy had tossed away the cigarette picked up the suitcase
and was waiting Now he strode into the lantern light

Here I am he answered trying hard not to appear too eager Were you
looking for me

The holder of the lantern tucked the reins between the whipsocket and
the dash and climbed out of the buggy He was a little man perhaps
about fortyeight or fifty with a smoothshaven face wrinkled at the
corners of the mouth and eyes His voice was the most curious thing
about him it was high and piping more like a womans than a mans Yet
his words and manner were masculine enough and he moved and spoke with
a nervous jerky quickness

He answered the question promptly Guess I be guess I be he said
briskly Anyhow Im lookin for a boy name ofname ofMy soul to
heavens Ive forgot it again I do believe What did you say your name
was

Speranza Albert Speranza

Sartin sartin Spererumyes yes Knew it just as well as I did
my own Well well well Yees yes yes Get right aboard Alfred Let
me take your satchel

He picked up the suitcase The boy his foot upon the buggy step still
hesitated Then youreyoure not my grandfather he faltered

Eh Who Your grandfather Me He he he He chuckled shrilly No
no No such luck If I was Capn Lote Snow Id be some oldern I be now
and a dum sight richer Yes yes No Im Capn Lotes bookkeeper over
at the lumber consarn Hes got a cold and Olivethats his wifeshe
said he shouldnt come out tonight He said he should and while they
was Katydidin back and forth about it RachelMrs Ellisshes the
hired housekeeper thereshe telephoned me to harness up and come meet
you up here to the depot Ererlittle mite late want I

Why yes just a little The other man the one who drives the mail
cartI think that was what it wassaid perhaps the horse was sick or
something like that

Noo no that want it this time IerAll tucked in and warm
enough be you Yees yes yes No Im to blame I shouldnt wonder I
stopped at theat the store a minute and met one or two of the fellers
and that kind of held me up All right now Yees yes yes Glong
gal

The buggy moved away from the platform Its passenger his chilly feet
and legs tightly wrapped in the robes drew a breath of relief between
his chattering teeth He was actually going somewhere at last whatever
happened morning would not find him propped frozen stiff against the
scarred and mangy clapboards of the South Harniss station

Warm enough be you inquired his driver cheerfully

Yes thank you

Thats good thats good thats good Yees yes yes
WellerFrederick how do you think youre goin to like South
Harniss

The answer was rather noncommittal The boy replied that he had not
seen very much of it as yet His companion seemed to find the statement
highly amusing He chuckled and slapped his knee

Aint seen much of it eh Noo no no I guess you aint guess you
aint He he he    Um    Lets see what was I talkin about

Why nothing in particular I think MrMr

Didnt I tell you my name Sho sho Thats funny My names
KeelerLaban B Keeler Thats my name and bookkeeper is my station
South Harniss is my dwellin placeand I guess likely youll have to
see the minister about the rest of it He he he

His passenger to whom the old schoolbook quatrain was entirely unknown
wondered what on earth the man was talking about However he smiled
politely and sniffed with a dawning suspicion It seemed to him there
was an unusual scent in the air a spirituous scent a

Have a peppermint lozenger suggested Mr Keeler with sudden
enthusiasm Peppermint is good for what ails you so they tell me
Yees yes yes Have one Have two have a lot

He proceeded to have a lot himself and the buggy was straightway
reflavored so to speak The boy his suspicions by no means dispelled
leaned back in the corner behind the curtains and awaited developments
He was warmer that was a real physical and consequently a slight mental
comfort but the feeling of lonesomeness was still acute So far his
acquaintanceship with the citizens of South Harniss had not filled him
with enthusiasm They were what he in his former and very recent state
of existence would have called Rubes Were the grandparents whom he
had never met this sort of people It seemed probable What sort of
a place was this to which Fate had consigned him The sense of utter
helplessness which had had him in its clutches since the day when he
received the news of his fathers death was as dreadfully real as ever
He had not been consulted at all No one had asked him what he wished to
do or where he wished to go The letter had come from these people the
Cape Cod grandparents of whom up to that time he had never even
heard and he had been shipped to them as though he were a piece of
merchandise And what was to become of him now after he reached his
destination What would they expect him to do Or be How would he be
treated

In his extensive readinghe had been an omnivorous readerthere were
numerous examples of youths left like him to the care of distant
relatives or stepparents or utter strangers Their experiences
generally speaking had not been cheerful ones Most of them had run
away He might run away but somehow the idea of running away with no
money to face hardship and poverty and all the rest did not make an
alluring appeal He had been used to comfort and luxury ever since he
could remember and his imagination an unusually active one visualized
much more keenly than the average the tribulations and struggles of a
runaway David Copperfield he remembered had run away but he did it
when a kid not a man like himself Nicholas Nicklebyno Nicholas had
not run away exactly but his father had died and he had been left to an
uncle It would be dreadful if his grandfather should turn out to be a
man like Ralph Nickleby Yet Nicholas had gotten on well in spite of his
wicked relative Yes and how gloriously he had defied the old
rascal too He wondered if he would ever be called upon to defy his
grandfather He saw himself doing itquietly a perfect gentleman
always but with the noble determination of one performing a
disagreeable duty His chin lifted and his shoulders squared against the
back of the buggy

Mr Keeler who had apparently forgotten his passenger altogether broke
into song


 Shes my darlin hankypanky
 And she wears a number two
 Her father keeps a barber shop
 Way out in Kalamazoo


He sang the foregoing twice over and then added a chorus plainly
improvised made up of Di doos and Di dums ad lib And the buggy
rolled up and over the slope of a little hill and in the face of a
screaming sea wind descended a long gentle slope to where scattered
along a twomile water frontage the lights of South Harniss twinkled
sparsely


 Did doo dum dee dum doo dum
 Di doo dum doo dum dee


So sang Mr Keeler Then he broke off his solo as the little mare turned
in between a pair of high wooden posts bordering a drive jogged along
that drive for perhaps fifty feet and stopped beside the stone step
of a white front door Through the arched window above that door shone
lamplight warm and yellow

Whoa commanded Mr Keeler most unnecessarily Then as if himself a
bit uncertain as to his exact whereabouts he peered out at the door and
the house of which it was a part afterward settling back to announce
triumphantly And here we be Yes sir here we be

Then the door opened A flood of lamplight poured upon the buggy and its
occupants And the boy saw two people standing in the doorway a man and
a woman

It was the woman who spoke first It was she who had opened the door
The man was standing behind her looking over her shoulderover her head
really for he was tall and broad and she short and slender

Is it she faltered

Mr Keeler answered Yes maam he declared emphatically thats who
tis Here we beererwhatsyournameEdward Jump right out

His passenger alighted from the buggy The woman bent forward to look at
him her hands clasped

Itits Albert isnt it she asked

The boy nodded Yes he said

The hands unclasped and she held them out toward him Oh Albert she
cried Im your grandmother I

The man interrupted Wait till we get him inside Olive he said
Come in son Then addressing the driver he ordered Labe take the
horse and team out to the barn and unharness for me will you

Yees yes yes replied Mr Keeler Yes indeed Capn Take her
right alongright off Yes indeedy Git dap

He drove off toward the end of the yard where a large building
presumably a barn loomed black against the dark sky He sang as
he drove and the big man on the step looked after him and sniffed
suspiciously

Meanwhile the boy had followed the little woman into the house through
a small front hall from which a narrow flight of stairs shot aloft with
almost unbelievable steepness and into a large room Albert had a
swift impression of big windows full of plants of pictures of ships and
schooners on the walls of a table set for four

Take your things right off cried his grandmother Here Ill take
em There now turn round and let me look at you Dont move till I
get a good look

He stood perfectly still while she inspected him from head to foot

Youve got her mouth she said slowly Yes youve got her mouth Her
hair and eyes were brown and yours are black butbut I THINK you look
like her Oh I did so want you to May I kiss you Albert Im your
grandmother you know

With embarrassed shyness he leaned forward while she put her arms about
his neck and kissed him on the cheek As he straightened again he
became aware that the big man had entered the room and was regarding him
intently beneath a pair of shaggy gray eyebrows Mrs Snow turned

Oh Zelotes she cried hes got Janies mouth dont you think so
And he DOES look like her doesnt he

Her husband shook his head Maybe so Mother he said with a half
smile I aint a great hand for locatin who folks look like How are
you boy Glad to see you Im your grandfather you know

They shook hands while each inspected and made a mental estimate of the
other Albert saw a square bearded jaw a firm mouth gray eyes with
many wrinkles at the corners and a shock of thick gray hair The eyes
had a way of looking straight at you through you as if reading your
thoughts divining your motives and making a general appraisal of you
and them

Captain Zelotes Snow for his part saw a tall young fellow slim and
straight with black curly hair large black eyes and regular features
A goodlooking boy a handsome boyalmost too handsome perhaps or
with just a touch of the effeminate in the good looks The captains
glance took in the wellfitting suit of clothes the expensive tie the
gold watch chain

Humph grunted Captain Zelotes Well your grandma and I are glad
to have you with us Let me see Albertthats your right name aint
itAlbert

Something in his grandfathers looks or tone aroused a curious feeling
in the youth It was not a feeling of antagonism exactly but more of
defiance of obstinacy He felt as if this big man regarding him so
keenly from under the heavy brows was looking for faults was expecting
to find something wrong might almost be disappointed if he did not find
it He met the gaze for a moment the color rising to his cheeks

My name he said deliberately is Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza

Mrs Snow uttered a little exclamation Oh she ejaculated And then
added Whywhy I thoughtwewe understood twas Albert We didnt
know there waswe didnt know there was any more to it What did you
say it was

Her grandson squared his shoulders Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza
he repeated My fatherthere was pride in his voice nowmy fathers
name was Miguel Carlos Of course you knew that

He spoke as if all creation must have known it Mrs Snow looked
helplessly at her husband Captain Zelotes rubbed his chin

Well he drawled dryly I guess likely well get along with
Albert for a spell I callate twill come more handy to us Cape
folks Were kind of plain and everyday round here Sappers ready
aint it Mother Al must be hungry Im plaguey sure _I_ am

But Zelotes maybe hed like to go up to his bedroom first Hes been
ridin a long ways in the cars and maybe hed like to wash up or change
his clothes

Change his clothes Lord sakes Olive what would he want to change his
clothes this time of night for You dont want to change your clothes
do you boy

No sir I guess not

Sartin sure you dont Want to wash Theres a basin and soap and towel
right out there in the kitchen

He pointed to the kitchen door At that moment the door was partially
opened and a brisk feminine voice from behind it inquired How about
eatin Are you all ready in there

It was Captain Snow who answered

You bet we are Rachel he declared All ready and then some Trot
her out Sit down Mother Sit down Al Now then Rachel all aboard

Rachel it appeared was the owner of the brisk feminine voice just
mentioned She was brisk herself as to age about forty plump rosy and
very businesslike She whisked the platter of fried mackerel and the
dishes of baked potatoes stewed corn hot biscuits and all the rest
to the table is no time and then to Alberts astonishment sat down at
that table herself Mrs Snow did the honors

Albert she said this is Mrs Ellis who helps me keep house
Rachel this is my grandson AlberterSperanza

She pronounced the surname in a tone almost apologetic Mrs Ellis did
not attempt to pronounce it She extended a plump hand and observed Is
that so Real glad to know you Albert How do you think youre goin to
like South Harniss

Considering that his acquaintance with the village had been so decidedly
limited Albert was somewhat puzzled how to reply His grandfather saved
him the trouble

Lord sakes Rachel he declared he aint seen moren three square
foot of it yet Its darkern the inside of a niggers undershirt
outdoors tonight Well AlAlbert I mean how are you on mackerel
Pretty good stowage room below decks About so much eh

Mrs Snow interrupted

Zelotes she said reprovingly aint you forgettin somethin

Eh Forgettin Heavens to Betsy so I am Lord we thank thee for
these and all other gifts Amen What did I do with the fork swallow
it

As long as he lives Albert Speranza will not forget that first meal in
the home of his grandparents It was so strange so different from
any other meal he had ever eaten The food was good and there was an
abundance of it but the surroundings were so queer Instead of the
wellordered and sedate school meal here all the eatables from fish
to pie were put upon the table at the same time and the servantor
housekeeper which to his mind were one and the samesat down not
only to eat with the family but to take at least an equal part in the
conversation And the conversation itself was so different Beginning
with questions concerning his own journey from the New York town where
the school was located it at length reached South Harniss and there
centered about the diminutive person of Laban Keeler his loquacious and
tuneful rescuer from the platform of the railway station

Where are your things Albert asked Mrs Snow Your trunk or
travelin bag or whatever you had I mean

My trunks are coming by express began the boy Captain Zelotes
interrupted him

Your trunks he repeated Got moren one have you

Whywhy yes there are three Mr Holdenhe is the headmaster you
know

Eh Headmaster Oh you mean the boss teacher up there at the school
Yes yes Umhm

Yes sir Mr Holden says the trunks should get here in a few days

Mrs Ellis the housekeeper made the next remark Did I understand you
to say you had THREE trunks she demanded

Why yes

Three trunks for one boy For mercy sakes what have you got in em

Whywhy my things My clothes andandeverything

Everything or just about I should say Goodness gracious me when
I go up to Boston I have all I can do to fill up one trunk And Im
biggern you arebigger round anyway

There was no doubt about that Captain Zelotes laughed shortly

That statement aint what Id call exaggerated Rachel he declared
Every time I see you and Laban out walkin together he has to keep on
the sunny side or be in a total eclipse And by the way speakin
of LabanSay son how did you and he get along comin down from the
depot

All right It was pretty dark

Ill bet you Laban wasnt very talkative was he

Why yes sir he talked a good deal but he sang most of the time

This simple statement appeared to cause a most surprising sensation The
Snows and their housekeeper looked at each other Captain Zelotes leaned
back in his chair and whistled

Whew he observed Hum Sho Thunderation

Oh dear exclaimed his wife

Mrs Ellis the housekeeper drew a long breath I might have expected
it she said tartly Its past time Hes pretty nigh a month overdue
as tis

Captain Snow rose to his feet I was kind of suspicious when he started
for the barn he declared Seemed to me he was singin then WHAT did
he sing boy he asked turning suddenly upon his grandson

Whywhy I dont know I didnt notice particularly You see it was
pretty cold and

Mrs Ellis interrupted Did he sing anything about somebodys bein his
darlin hankypanky and wearin a number two she demanded sharply

Whywhy yes he did

Apparently that settled it Mrs Snow said Oh dear again and the
housekeeper also rose from the table

Youd better go right out to the barn this minute Capn Lote she
said and I guess likely Id better go with you

The captain already had his cap on his head

No Rachel he said I dont need you Callate I can take care
of most anything thats liable to have happened If he aint put the
bridle to bed in the stall and hung the mare up on the harness pegs I
judge I can handle the job Wonder how fur along hed got Didnt hear
him singin anything about Hyannis on the Cape did you boy

No

Thats some comfort Now dont you worry Mother Ill be back in a
few minutes

Mrs Snow clasped her hands Oh I HOPE he hasnt set the barn afire
she wailed

No danger of that I guess No Rachel you tend to your supper I
dont need you

He tramped out into the hall and the door closed behind him Mrs Snow
turned apologetically to her puzzled grandson who was entirely at a
loss to know what the trouble was about

You see Albert she hesitatingly explained LabanMr Keelerthe
man who drove you down from the depothehes an awful nice man and
your grandfather thinks the world and all of him butbut every once in
a while heOh dear I dont know how to say it to you but

Evidently Mrs Ellis knew how to say it for she broke into the
conversation and said it then and there

Every once in a while he gets tipsy she snapped And I only wish I
had my fingers this minute in the hair of the scamp that gave him the
liquor

A light broke upon Alberts mind Oh Oh yes he exclaimed I
thought he acted a little queer and once I thought I smeltOh that
was why he was eating the peppermints

Mrs Snow nodded There was a moment of silence Suddenly the
housekeeper who had resumed her seat in compliance with Captain
Zelotes order slammed back her chair and stood up

Ive hated the smell of peppermint for twentytwo year she declared
and went out into the kitchen Albert looking after her felt his
grandmothers touch upon his sleeve

I wouldnt say any more about it before her she whispered Shes
awful sensitive

Why in the world the housekeeper should be particularly sensitive
because the man who had driven him from the station ate peppermint was
quite beyond the boys comprehension Nor could he thoroughly understand
why the suspicion of Mr Keelers slight inebriety should cause such a
sensation in the Snow household He was inclined to think the tipsiness
rather funny Of course alcohol was lectured against often enough
at school and on one occasion a member of the senior classa
twentyyearold holdover who should have graduated the fall
beforehad been expelled for having beer in his room but during his
long summer vacations spent precariously at hotels or in short visits
to his fathers friends young Speranza had learned to be tolerant
Tolerance was a necessary virtue in the circle surrounding Speranza
Senior in his later years The popping of corks at all hours of the
night and bottles full half full or empty were sounds and sights to
which Albert had been well accustomed When one has more than once seen
his own father overcome by conviviality and the affair treated as a huge
joke one is not inclined to be too censorious when others slip What
if the queer old Keeler guy was tight Was that anything to raise such a
row about

Plainly he decided this was a strange place this household of his
grandparents His premonition that they might be Rubes seemed
likely to have been well founded What would his fatherhis great
worldfamous fatherhave thought of them Bah these Yankee
bourgeoisie He could almost hear him say it Miguel Carlos Speranza
detestedin privatethe Yankee bourgeoisie He took their money and
he married one of their daughters but he detested them During his last
years when the money had not flowed his way as copiously the detest
grew

You wont say anything about Laban before Mrs Ellis will you
Albert persisted Mrs Snow Shes dreadful sensitive Ill explain by
and by

He promised repressing a condescending smile

Both the housekeeper and Captain Snow returned in a few minutes The
latter reported that the mare was safe and sound in her stall

The harness was mostly on the floor but Jess was all right thank the
Lord observed the captain

Jess is our horses name Albert explained Mrs Snow That is her
names Jessamine but Zelotes cant ever seem to say the whole of any
name When we first bought Jessamine I named her Magnolia but he
called her Mag all the time and I COULDNT stand that Have some more
preserves Albert do

All through the meal Albert was uneasily conscious that his grandfather
was looking at him from under the shaggy brows measuring him
estimating him reading him through and through He resented the
scrutiny and the twinkle of sardonic humor which it seemed to him
accompanied it His way of handling his knife and fork his clothes his
tie his manner of eating and drinking and speaking all these Captain
Zelotes seemed to note and appraise But whatever the results of his
scrutiny and appraisal might be he kept them entirely to himself When
he addressed his grandson directly which was not often his remarks
were trivial commonplaces and although pleasant enough were terse and
to the point

Several times Mrs Snow would have questioned Albert concerning the life
at school but each time her husband interfered

Not now not now Mother he said The boy aint goin to run away
tonight Hell be here tomorrow and a good many tomorrows
ifand here again Albert seemed to detect the slight sarcasm and
the twinkleif we oldfashioned down easters aint too common and
everyday for a hightoned young chap like him to put up with No no
dont make him talk tonight Cant you see hes so sleepy that its
only the exercise of openin his mouth to eat that keeps his eyes from
shuttin How about that son

It was perfectly true The long train ride the excitement the cold
wait on the station platform and the subsequent warmth of the room the
hearty meal all these combined to make for sleepiness so overpowering
that several times the boy had caught his nose descending toward his
plate in a most inelegant nod But it hurt his pride to think his
grandfather had noticed his condition

Oh Im all right he said with dignity

Somehow the dignity seemed to have little effect upon Captain Zelotes

Umyes I know observed the latter dryly but I guess likely youll
be more all right in bed Mother youll show Albert where to turn in
wont you Theres your suitcase out there in the hall son I fetched
it in from the barn just now

Mrs Snow ventured a protest

Oh Zelotes she cried aint we goin to talk with him at ALL Why
there is so much to say

Twill say just as well tomorrow mornin Mother better because
well have all day to say it in Get the lamp

Albert looked at his watch

Why its only halfpast nine he said

Captain Zelotes who also had been looking at the watch which was a
very fine and very expensive one smiled slightly Halfpast nine some
nights he said is equal to halfpast twelve others This is one of
the some There there son youre so sleepy this minute that youve
got a list to starboard When you and I have that talk thats comin
to us we want to be shipshape and on an even keel Rachel light that
lamp

The housekeeper brought in and lighted a small hand lamp Mrs Snow
took it and led the way to the hall and the narrow breakneck flight of
stairs Captain Zelotes laid a hand on his grandsons shoulder

Goodnight son he said quietly

Albert looked into the gray eyes Their expression was not unkindly
but there was or he imagined there was the same quizzical sardonic
twinkle He resented that twinkle more than ever it made him feel very
young indeed and correspondingly obstinate Something of that obstinacy
showed in his own eyes as he returned his grandfathers look

Goodnightsir he said and for the life of him he could not resist
hesitating before adding the sir As he climbed the steep stairs
he fancied he heard a short sniff or chucklehe was not certain
whichfrom the big man in the diningroom

His bedroom was a goodsized room that is it would have been of good
size if the person who designed it had known what the term square
meant Apparently he did not and had built the apartment on the
hitormiss higgletypigglety pattern with unexpected alcoves cut into
the walls and closets and chimneys built out from them There were
three windows a big bed an oldfashioned bureau a chest of drawers a
washstand and several oldfashioned chairs Mrs Snow put the lamp upon
the bureau She watched him anxiously as he looked about the room

Dodo you like it she asked

Albert replied that he guessed he did Perhaps there was not too much
certainty in his tone He had never before seen a room like it

Oh I hope you will like it It was your mothers room Albert She
slept here from the time she was seven untiluntil she went away

The boy looked about him with a new interest an odd thrill His
mothers room His mother He could just remember her but that was all
The memories were childish and unsatisfactory but they were memories
And she had slept there this had been her room when she was a girl
before she married beforelong before such a person as Alberto Miguel
Carlos Speranza had been even dreamed of That was strange it was queer
to think about Long before he was born when she was years younger than
he as he stood there now she had stood there had looked from those
windows had

His grandmother threw her arms about his neck and kissed him Her cheek
was wet

Goodnight Albert she said chokingly and hurried out of the room

He undressed quickly for the room was very cold He opened the window
after a desperate struggle and climbed into bed The wind whistling
in obligingly blew out the lamp for him It shrieked and howled about
the eaves and the old house squeaked and groaned Albert pulled the
comforter up about his neck and concentrated upon the business of going
to sleep He who could scarcely remember when he had had a real home
was desperately homesick

Downstairs in the diningroom Captain Zelotes stood his hands in his
pockets looking through the mica panes of the stove door at the fire
within His wife came up behind him and laid a hand on his sleeve

What are you thinkin about Father she asked

Her husband shook his head I was wonderin he said what my
granddad the original Capn Lote Snow that built this house would have
said if hed known that hed have a greatgreatgrandson come to live in
it who was scornfully a halfbreed

Olives grip tightened on his arm

Oh DONT talk so Zelotes she begged Hes our Janies boy

The captain opened the stove door regarded the redhot coals for an
instant and then slammed the door shut again

I know Mother he said grimly Its for the sake of Janies half
that Im takin in the other

Butbut Zelotes dont you think he seems like a nice boy

The twinkle reappeared in Captain Lotes eyes

I think HE thinks hes a nice boy Mother he said There there
lets go to bed



CHAPTER II


The story of the events which led up to the coming on this December
night of a halfbreed grandson to the Snow homestead was an old
story in South Harniss The date of its beginning was as far back as the
year 1892

In the fall of that year Captain Zelotes Snow was in Savannah He was in
command of the coasting schooner Olive S and the said schooner was then
discharging a general cargo preparatory to loading with rice and cotton
for Philadelphia With the captain in Savannah was his only daughter
Jane Olivia age a scant eighteen pretty charming romantic and
head over heels in love with a handsome baritone then singing in a
popularpriced grand opera company It was because of this handsome
baritone who by the way was a Spaniard named Miguel Carlos Speranza
that Jane Snow was then aboard her fathers vessel Captain Lote was not
in the habit of taking his womenfolks on his voyages with him Skirts
clutter up the deck too much was his opinion

He had taken Jane however not only on this voyage but on that
preceding it which had been to Rio It was Captain Lotes belief
and his wifes hope that a succession of sea winds might blow away
recollections of Senor Speranzafan the garlic out of her head as
the captain inelegantly expressed it Jane had spent her sixteenth and
seventeenth years at a school for girls near Boston The opera company
of which Speranza was a member was performing at one of the
minor theaters A party of the school girls duly chaperoned and
facultyguarded of course attended a series of matinees At these
matinees Jane first saw her hero brave in doublet and hose and braver
still in melody and romance She and her mates looked and listened
and worshiped from afar as is the habit of maidenly youth under such
circumstances There is no particular danger in such worship provided
the worshiper remains always at a safely remote distance from the idol
But in Janes case this safetybar was removed by Fate The wife of a
friend of her fathers the friend being a Boston merchant named Cole
with whom Captain Zelotes had had business dealings for many years was
a music lover She was in the habit of giving what she was pleased to
call musical teas at her home Jane to whom Mr and Mrs Cole had
taken a marked fancy was often invited to those teas and because the
Coles were among our nicest people she was permitted by the school
authorities to attend

At one of those teas Senor Miguel Carlos Speranza was the brightest
star The Senor then in his twentyninth year handsome talented and
picturesque shone refulgent Other and far more experienced feminine
hearts than Jane Snows were flutteringly disturbed by the glory of
his rays Jane and he met they shook hands they conversed And at
subsequent teas they met again for Speranza on his part was strongly
attracted to the simple unaffected Cape Cod schoolgirl It was not
her beauty alonethough beauty she had and of an unusual typeit
was something else a personality which attracted all who met her
The handsome Spaniard had had many love affairs of a more or less
perfunctory kind but here was something different something he had
not known He began by exerting his powers of fascination in a lazy
careless way To his astonishment the said powers were not overwhelming
If Jane was fascinated she was not conquered She remained sweet
simple direct charmingly aloof

And Speranza was at first puzzled then piqued then himself madly
fascinated He wrote fervid letters he begged for interviews he
haunted each one of Mrs Coles teas And at last he wrung from Jane
a confession of her love her promise to marry him And that very week
Miss Donaldson the head of the school discovered and read a package of
the Senors letters to her pupil

Captain Zelotes happened to be at home from a voyage Being summoned
from South Harniss he came to Boston and heard the tale from Miss
Donaldsons agitated lips Jane was his joy his pride her future was
the great hope and dream of his life WHEN she marriedwhich was not
to be thought of for an indefinite number of years to comeshe would of
course marry awell not a President of the United States perhapsbut
an admiral possibly or a millionaire or the owner of a fleet of
steamships or something like that The idea that she should even
think of marrying a playactor was unbelievable The captain had never
attended the performance of an opera what was more he never expected
to attend one He had been given to understand that a parcel of
playactin men and women hollered and screamed to music for a couple
of hours Olive his wife had attended an opera once and according
to her it was more like a cat fight than anything else Nobody but
foreigners ever had anything to do with operas And for foreigners of
all kindsbut the Latin variety of foreigner in particularCaptain
Zelotes Snow cherished a detest which was almost fanatic

And now his daughter his own Janie was receiving ardent love
letters from a playacting foreigner a Spaniard a Portygee a
macaronieater When finally convinced that it was true that the
letters had really been written to Jane which took some time he
demanded first of all to be shown the Portygee Miss Donaldson could
not of course produce the latter forthwith but she directed her irate
visitor to the theater where the opera company was then performing To
the theater Captain Zelotes went He did not find Speranza there but
from a frightened attendant he browbeat the information that the singer
was staying at a certain hotel So the captain went to the hotel It was
eleven oclock in the morning Senor Speranza was in bed and could not
be disturbed Couldnt eh By the great and everlasting et cetera and
continued he was going to be disturbed then and there And unless some
of the hotels hired help set about the disturbing it would be done
for them So rather than summon the police the hotel management
summoned its guest and the first and only interview between the
father and lover of Jane Snow took place

It was not a long interview but it was spirited Captain Zelotes began
by being what he considered diplomatic Having assured his wife before
leaving home and the alarmed Miss Donaldson subsequently that there
was to be no trouble whatevereverything would be settled as smooth
and easy as slidin downhill that feller wont make any fuss youll
seehaving thus prophesied the captain felt it incumbent upon himself
to see to the fulfillment So he began by condescendingly explaining
that of course he was kind of sorry for the young man before him young
folks were young folks and of course he presumed likely twas natural
enough and the like of that you understand But of course also Mr
Speranza must realize that the thing could not go on any further Jane
was his daughter and her people were nice people and naturally that
being the case her mother and he would be pretty particular as to who
she kept company with to say nothing of marrying which event was
not to be thought of for ten years anyway Now he didnt want to
beerpersonal or anything like that and of course he wouldnt think
of saying that Mr Speranza wasnt a nice enough man forwell forfor
   You see everybody wasnt as particular as he and Mrs Snow were
But

Here Senor Speranza interrupted He politely desired to know if the
person speaking was endeavoring to convey the idea that he Miguel
Carlos Speranza was not of sufficient poseetion goodness standing
what it is to be considered as suitor for that persons daughters
hand Did Meester Snow comprehend to whom he addressed himself

The interview terminated not long after The captains parting remark
was in the nature of an ultimatum It was to the effect that if
Speranza or any other condemned undesirable like him dared to so
much as look in the direction of Jane Olivia Snow his daughter he
personally would see that the return for that look was a charge of
buckshot Speranza whitefaced and furiously gesticulative commanded
the astonished bellboy to put that Bah pigidiot out into the hall
and air the room immediately afterward

Having as he considered satisfactorily attended to the presumptuous
lover Captain Zelotes returned to the school and to what he believed
would be the comparatively easy task the bringing of his daughter to
reason Jane had always been an obedient girl she was devoted to her
parents Of course although she might feel rather disappointed at
first she would soon get over it The idea that she might flatly
refuse to get over it that she might have a will of her own and a
determination equal to that of the father from whom she inherited it
did not occur to the captain at all

But his enlightenment was prompt and complete Jane did not rage or
become hysterical she did not even weep in his presence But quietly
with a set of her square little chin she informed Captain Zelotes that
she loved Speranza that she meant to marry him and that she should
marry him some day or other The captain raged commanded pleaded
begged What was the matter with her What had come over her Didnt she
love her father and mother any more that she should set out to act this
way Yes she declared that she loved them as much as ever but that
she loved her lover more than all the world and no onenot even her
parentsshould separate them

Captain Zelotes gave it up at last That is he gave up the appeal to
reason and the pleadings But he did not give up the idea of having his
own way in the matter being Zelotes Snow he certainly did not give
that up Instead he took his daughter home with him to South Harniss
where a tearful and heartbroken Olive added her persuasions to his
But when she found Jane obdurate Mrs Snow might have surrendered
Not her husband however Instead he conceived a brilliant idea He was
about to start on a voyage to Rio Janeiro he would take his wife and
daughter with him Under their immediate observation and far removed
from the influence of that Portygee Jane would be in no danger and
might forget

Jane made no remonstrance She went to Rio and returned She was always
calm outwardly pleasant and quiet never mentioned her lover unless in
answer to a question but she never once varied from her determination
not to give him up The Snows remained at home for a month Then
Zelotes Jane accompanying him sailed from Boston to Savannah Olive
did not go with them she hated the sea and by this time both she and
her husband were somewhat reassured So far as they could learn by
watchful observation of their daughter the latter had not communicated
with Speranza nor received communications from him If she had not
forgotten him it seemed likely that he had forgotten her The thought
made the captain furiously angry but it comforted him too

During the voyage to Savannah this sense of comfort became stronger
Jane seemed in better spirits She was always obedient but now she
began to seem almost cheerful to speak and even laugh occasionally
just as she used to Captain Zelotes patted himself on the back
figuratively His scheme had been a good one

And in Savannah one afternoon Jane managed to elude her fathers
observation to leave the schooner and to disappear completely And
that night came a letter She and Miguel Carlos Speranza had been
in correspondence all the time how or through whose connivance is a
mystery never disclosed He had come to Savannah in accordance with
mutual arrangement they had met were married and had gone away
together

I love you Father Jane wrote in the letter I love you and Mother
so very VERY much Oh PLEASE believe that But I love him too And I
could not give him up You will see why when you know him really know
him If it were not for you I should be SO happy I know you cant
forgive me now but some day I am sure you will forgive us both

Captain Zelotes was far far from forgiveness as he read that letter
His first mate who was beside him when he opened and read it was
actually frightened when he saw the look on the skippers face He went
white said the mate not pale but white same as a dead man oror
the underside of a flatfish or somethin For the Lord sakes Capn
says I whats the matter He never answered me stood starin at
the letter Then he looked up not at me but as if somebody else was
standin there on tother side of the cabin table Forgive him he
says kind of slow and under his breath I wont forgive his black soul
in hell When I heard him say it I give you my word my hair riz under
my cap If ever there was killin in a mans voice and in his looks
twas in Capn Lotes that night When I asked him again what was the
matter he didnt answer any more than he had the first time A few
minutes afterwards he went into his stateroom and shut the door I
didnt see him again until the next mornin

Captain Zelotes made no attempt to follow the runaway couple He did
take pains to ascertain that they were legally married but that
was all He left his schooner in charge of the mate at Savannah and
journeyed north to South Harniss and his wife A week he remained at
home with her then returned to the Olive S and took up his command and
its duties as if nothing had happened But what had happened changed his
whole life He became more taciturn a trifle less charitable a little
harder and more worldly Before the catastrophe he had been interested
in business success and the making of money chiefly because of his plans
for his daughters future Now he worked even harder because it helped
him to forget He became sole owner of the Olive S then of other
schooners People spoke of him as one destined to become a wealthy man

Jane lived only a few years after her marriage She died at the birth of
her second child who died with her Her first a boy was born a year
after the elopement She wrote her mother to tell that news and Olive
answered the letter She begged permission of her husband to invite Jane
and the baby to visit the old home At first Zelotes said no flatly
the girl had made her bed let her lie in it But a year later he had
so far relented as to give reluctant consent for Jane and the child to
come provided her condemned husband did not accompany them If that
lowlived Portygee sets foot on my premises so help me God Ill
kill him declared the captain In his vernacular all foreigners were
Portygees

But Jane was as proud and stubborn as he Where her husband was not
welcome she would not go And a little later she had gone on the longest
of all journeys Speranza did not notify her parents except to send a
clipped newspaper account of her death and burial which arrived a week
after the latter had taken place The news prostrated Olive who was ill
for a month Captain Zelotes bore it as he had borne the other great
shock with outward calm and quiet Yet a year afterward he suddenly
announced his determination of giving up the sea and his prosperous and
growing shipping business and of spending the rest of his days on the
Cape

Olive was delighted of course Richesthat is more than a comfortable
competencyhad no temptations for her The old house home of three
generations of Snows was painted repaired and to some extent
modernized For another year Captain Zelotes loafed as he called it
although others might have considered his activities about the place
anything but that At the end of that year he surprised every one by
buying from the heirs of the estate the business equipment of the late
Eben Raymond hardware dealer and lumber merchant of South Harniss
said equipment comprising an office a store and lumber yards near
the railway station Got to have somethin to keep me from gettin
barnacled declared Captain Lote Theres enough old hulks rottin at
their moorins down here as tis I dont know anything about lumber and
half as much about hardware but I callate I can learn As an aid in
the learning process he retained as bookkeeper Laban Keeler who had
acted in that capacity for the former proprietor

The years slipped away a dozen of them as smoothly and lazily as South
Harniss years have always slipped Captain Zelotes was past sixty
now but as vigorous as when forty stubborn as ever fond of using
quarterdeck methods on shore and especially in townmeeting and
very often in trouble in consequence He was a member of the Board of
Selectmen and was in the habit of characterizing those whose opinions
differed from his as narrowminded They retorted by accusing him of
being pigheaded There was some truth on both sides His detest of
foreigners had not abated in the least

And then in this December of the year 1910 fell as from a clear sky
the legacy of a grandson From Senor Miguel Carlos Speranza the Snows
had had no direct word had received nothing save the newspaper clipping
already mentioned Olive had never seen him her husband had seen him
only on the occasion of the memorable interview in the hotel room They
never spoke of him never mentioned him to each other Occasionally
in the Boston newspapers his likeness in costume had appeared amid the
music notes or theatrical jottings But these had not been as numerous
of late Of his son their own daughters child they knew nothing
he might be alive or he might be dead Sometimes Olive found herself
speculating concerning him wondering if he was alive and if he
resembled Jane But she put the speculation from her thoughts she
could not bear to bring back memories of the old hopes and their bitter
ending Sometimes Captain Lote at his desk in the office of Z Snow
 Co Lumber and Builders Hardware caught himself dreaming of his
idolized daughter and thinking how different the future might have been
for him had she married a white man the kind of man he had meant for
her to marry There might be grandchildren growing up now fine boys
and girls to visit the old home at South Harniss Ah hum Well   
Labe how long has this bill of Abner Parkers been hangin on
For thunder sakes why dont he pay up He must think were runnin a
meetinhouse Christmas tree

The letter from the lawyer had come first It was written in New York
was addressed to Captain Lotus Snow and began by taking for granted
the fact that the recipient knew all about matters of which he knew
nothing Speranza was dead so much was plain and the inference was
that he had been fatally injured in an automobile accident particulars
of which you have of course read in the papers Neither Captain Lote
nor his wife had read anything of the kind in the papers The captain
had been very busy of late and had read little except political news
and Mrs Snow never read of murders and accidents their details at
least She looked up from the letter which her husband had hastened
home from the office to bring her with a startled face

Oh Zelotes she cried hes dead

The captain nodded

Seems so he said That parts plain enough but go on The rest of
it is what I cant get a handhold on See what you make of the rest of
it Olive

The rest of it was to the effect that the writer being Mr Speranzas
business adviser that is to say as much or more so than any one
else had been called in at the time of the accident had conferred
with the injured man and had learned his last wishes He expressed
himself coherently concerning his son went on the letter and it is
in regard to that son that I am asking an interview with you I should
have written sooner but have been engaged with matters pertaining to
Mr Speranzas estate and personal debts The latter seem to be large

ILL bet you observed Captain Zelotes sententiously interrupting
his wifes reading by pointing to this sentence with a big forefinger

And the estates affairs much tangled went on Olive reading aloud
It seems best that I should see you concerning the boy at once I
dont know whether or not you are aware that he is at school in 
New York I am inclined to think that the estate itself will scarcely
warrant the expense of his remaining there Could you make it convenient
to come to New York and see me at once Or if not I shall be in
Boston on Friday of next week and can you meet me there It seems almost
impossible for me to come to you just now and of course you will
understand that I am acting as a sort of temporary executor merely
because Mr Speranza was formerly my friend and not because I have any
pecuniary interest in the settlement of his affairs

Very truly yours

MARCUS W WEISSMANN


Weissman Another Portygee snorted Captain Lote

Butbut what does it MEAN begged Mrs Snow Whywhy should he want
to see you Zelotes And the boywhywhy thats HER boy Its Janies
boy he must mean Zelotes

Her husband nodded

Hers and that blasted furriners he muttered I suppose so

Oh DONT speak that way Zelotes Dont Hes dead

Captain Lotes lips tightened If hed died twenty years ago twould
have been better for all hands he growled

Janies boy repeated Olive slowly Whywhy he must be a big boy
now Almost grown up

Her husband did not speak He was pacing the floor his hands in his
pockets

And this man wants to see you about him said Olive Then after a
moment she added timidly Are you goin Zelotes

Goin Where

To New York To see this lawyer man

I Not by a jugful What in blazes should I go to see him for

Wellwell he wants you to you know He wants to talk with you about
thethe boy

Humph

Its her boy Zelotes

Humph Young Portygee

Dont Zelotes Please    I know you cant forgive thatthat man
We cant either of us forgive him but

The captain stopped in his stride Forgive him he repeated Mother
dont talk like a fool Didnt he take away the one thing that I was
workin for that I was plannin for that I was LIVIN for I

She interrupted putting a hand on his sleeve

Not the only thing dear she said You had me you know

His expression changed He looked down at her and smiled

Thats right old lady he admitted I had you and thank the
Almighty for it Yes I had you    But his anger returning when
I think how that damned scamp stole our girl from us and then neglected
her and killed her

ZELOTES How you talk He DIDNT kill her How can you

Oh I dont mean he murdered her of course But Ill bet all Ive got
that he made her miserable Look here Mother you and she used to write
back and forth once in a while In any one of those letters did she ever
say she was happy

Mrs Snows answer was somewhat equivocal She never said she was
unhappy she replied Her husband sniffed and resumed his pacing up and
down

After a little Olive spoke again

New York IS a good ways she said Maybe twould be better for you to
meet this lawyer man in Boston Dont you think so

Bah

Another interval Then Zelotes

Yes impatiently What is it

Its her boy after all isnt it Our grandson yours and mine Dont
you thinkdont you think its your duty to go Zelotes

Captain Lote stamped his foot

For thunderation sakes Olive let up he commanded You ought to
know by this time that theres one thing I hate worse than doin my
duty thats bein preached to about it Let up Dont you say another
word

She did not having learned much by years of experience He said the
next word on the subject himself At noon when he came home for dinner
he said as they rose from the table Wheres my suitcase up attic

Why yes I guess likely tis Why

Instead of answering he turned to the housekeeper Mrs Ellis

Rachel he said go up and get that case and fetch it down to the
bedroom will you Hurry up Train leaves at halfpast two and its
most one now

Both women stared at him Mrs Ellis spoke first

Why Capn Lote she cried be you goin away

Her employers answer was crisp and very much to the point I am if
I can get that case time enough to pack it and make the train he
observed If you stand here askin questions I probably shall stay to
home

The housekeeper made a hasty exit by way of the back stairs Mrs Snow
still gazed wonderingly at her husband

Zelotes she faltered are youare you

Im goin to New York on tonights boat Ive telegraphed thatthat
WeissWeisswhatdoyoucallitthat Portygee lawyerthat Ill be to
his office tomorrow mornin

But Zelotes we havent scarcely talked about it you and I at all
You might have waited till he came to Boston Why do you go so SOON

The captains heavy brows drew together

You went to the dentists last Friday he said Why didnt you wait
till next week

Whywhy what a question My tooth ached and I wanted to have it fixed
quick as possible

Umm yes Well this tooth aches and I want it fixed or hauled out
one or tother I want the thing off my mind    Dont TALK to me
he added irritably I know Im a fool And with a peremptory wave of
the hand dont you DARE say anything about DUTY

He was back again two days later His wife did not question him but
waited for him to speak Those years of experience already mentioned had
taught her diplomacy He looked at her and pulled his beard Well he
observed when they were alone together I saw him

Thethe boy eagerly

No no Course not The boys at school somewhere up in New York State
how could I see him I saw that lawyer and I found out aboutabout the
other scamp He was killed in an auto accident drunk at the time I
callate Nighs I can gather hes been drinkin pretty heavy for the
last six or seven years Always lived high same as his kind generally
does and spent money like water I judgebut goin down hill fast
lately His voice was givin out on him and he realized it I presume
likely Now hes dead and left nothin but trunks full of stage clothes
and photographs and contemptuously letters from fool women and
debtsLord yes debts enough

But the boy Zelotes Janies boy

Hes been at this school place for pretty nigh ten years so the lawyer
feller said That lawyer was a pretty decent chap too for a furriner
Seems he used to know thisSperanza rascalwhen Speranza was younger
and more decentif he ever was really decent which I doubt But this
lawyer man was his friend then and about the only one he really had when
he was hurt There was plenty of makebelieve friends hangin on like
pilotfish to a shark for what they could get by spongin on him but
real friends were scarce

And the boy

For the Lord sakes Mother dont keep sayin The boy the boy
over and over again like a talkin machine Let me finish about the
father first This Weiserthingamajigthe lawyer had quite a talk
with Speranza afore he died or while he was dyin he only lived a few
hours after the accident and was out of his head part of that But
he said enough to let WeissererOh why CANT I remember that
Portygees nameto let him know that hed like to have him settle up
what was left of his affairs and to send word to us aboutabout the
boy There I hope you feel easier Mother Ive got round to the boy
at last

But why did he want word sent to us Zelotes He never wrote a line to
us in his life

You bet he didnt bitterly he knew better Why did he want word
sent now The answer to thats easy enough Cause he wanted to get
somethin out of us thats the reason From what that lawyer could
gather and from what hes found out since there aint money enough
for the boy to stay another six weeks at that school or anywhere else
unless the young feller earns it himself And leavin us out of the
count there isnt a relation this side of the salt pond Theres
probably a million or so over there in Portygeeland with a derisive
sniff those foreigners breed like flies But THEY dont count

But did he want word sent to us about the

Sshh Im tellin you Olive Im tellin you He wanted word sent
because he was in hopes that weyou and I Motherwould take that son
of his in at our house here and give him a home The cheek of it After
what hed done to you and me blast him The solid brass nerve of it

He stormed up and down the room His wife did not seem nearly so much
disturbed as he at the thought of the Speranza presumption She looked
anxiousyes but she looked eager too and her gaze was fixed upon her
husbands face

Oh she said softly Oh    Andand what did you say Zelotes

What did I say What do you suppose I said I said no and I said it
good and loud too

Olive made no comment She turned away her head and the captain
who now in his turn was watching her saw a suspicious gleam as of
moisture on her cheek He stopped his pacing and laid a hand on her
shoulder

There there Mother he said gently Dont cry Hes comin

Comin She turned pale Comin she repeated Who

That boy    Sshh shh impatiently Now dont go askin me
questions or tellin me what I just said I said I SAID the right thing
butWell hang it all what else could I DO I wrote the boyAlberta
letter and I wrote the boss of the school another one I sent a check
along for expenses andWell hell be here most any day now I
shouldnt wonder And WHAT in the devil are we goin to do with him

His wife did not reply to this outburst She was trembling with
excitement

Isis his name Albert she faltered

Umhm Seems so

Why thats your middle name Do youdo you spose Janie could have
named him forfor you

I dont know

Of course with some hesitation it may be she didnt If shed named
him Zelotes

Good heavens woman Isnt one name like that enough in the family
Thank the Lord were spared two of em But there hes comin And when
he gets herethen what

Olive put her arm about her big husband

I hopeyes Im sure you did right Zelotes and that alls goin to
turn out to be for the best

Are you Well _I_ aint sure not by a thousand fathom

Hes Janies boy

Yes And hes that playactors boy too One Speranza pretty nigh
ruined your life and mine Olive Whatll this one do    Well God
knows I suppose likely but He wont tell All we can do is wait and
see I tell you honest I aint very hopeful



CHAPTER III


A brisk rap on the door then a mans voice

Hello there Wake up

Albert rolled over opened one eye then the other and raised himself on
his elbow

Eh Whwhat he stammered

Seven oclock Time to turn out

The voice was his grandfathers Ohoh all right he answered

Understand me do you

Yesyes sir Ill be right down

The stairs creaked as Captain Zelotes descended them Albert yawned
cavernously stretched and slid one foot out of bed He drew it back
instantly however for the sensation was that of having thrust it into
a bucket of cold water The room had been cold the previous evening
plainly it was colder still now The temptation was to turn back and go
to sleep again but he fought against it Somehow he had a feeling that
to disregard his grandfathers summons would be poor diplomacy

He set his teeth and tossing back the bed clothes jumped to the floor
Then he jumped again for the floor was like ice The window was wide
open and he closed it but there was no warm radiator to cuddle against
while dressing He missed his compulsory morning shower a miss which
did not distress him greatly He shook himself into his clothes soused
his head and neck in a basin of ice water poured from a pitcher and
before brushing his hair looked out of the window

It was a sharp winter morning The wind had gone down but before
subsiding it had blown every trace of mist or haze from the air and
from his windowsill to the horizon every detail was clean cut and
distinct He was looking out it seemed from the back of the house The
roof of the kitchen extension was below him and to the right the high
roof of the barn Over the kitchen roof and to the left he saw little
rolling hills valleys cranberry swamps a pond A road wound in
and out and scattered along it were houses mostly white with green
blinds but occasionally varied by the gray of unpainted weathered
shingles A long lowspreading building a half mile off looked as if
it might be a summer hotel now closed and shuttered Beyond it was a
cluster of gray shanties and a gleam of water evidently a wharf and a
miniature harbor And beyond that the deep brilliant blue of the sea
Brown and blue were the prevailing colors but here and there clumps
and groves of pines gave splashes of green

There was an exhilaration in the crisp air He felt an unwonted
liveliness and a desire to be active which would have surprised some of
his teachers at the school he had just left The depression of spirits
of which he had been conscious the previous night had disappeared
along with his premonitions of unpleasantness He felt optimistic this
morning After giving his curls a rake with the comb he opened the door
and descended the steep stairs to the lower floor

His grandmother was setting the breakfast table He was a little
surprised to see her doing it What was the use of having servants if
one did the work oneself But perhaps the housekeeper was ill

Good morning he said

Mrs Snow who had not heard him enter turned and saw him When he
crossed the room she kissed him on the cheek

Good morning Albert she said I hope you slept well

Albert replied that he had slept very well indeed He was a trifle
disappointed that she made no comment on his promptness in answering his
grandfathers summons He felt such promptness deserved commendation At
school they rang two bells at ten minute intervals thus giving a fellow
a second chance It had been a point of senior etiquette to accept
nothing but that second chance Here apparently he was expected to
jump at the first There was a matter of course about his grandmothers
attitude which was disturbing

She went on setting the table talking as she did so

Im real glad you did sleep she said Some folks can hardly
ever sleep the first night in a strange room ZelotesI mean your
grandpas gone out to see to the horse and feed the hens and the pig
Hell be in pretty soon Then well have breakfast I suppose youre
awful hungry

As a matter of fact he was not very hungry Breakfast was always a
more or less perfunctory meal with him But he was surprised to see
the variety of eatables upon that table There were cookies there and
doughnuts and even half an apple pie Pie for breakfast It had been a
newspaper joke at which he had laughed many times But it seemed not to
be a joke here rather a solemn reality

The kitchen door opened and Mrs Ellis put in her head To Alberts
astonishment the upper part of the head beginning just above the brows
was swathed in a huge bandage The lower part was a picture of hopeless
misery

Has Capn Lote come in yet inquired the housekeeper faintly

Not yet Rachel replied Mrs Snow Hell be here in a minute
though Alberts down so you can begin takin up the things

The head disappeared A sigh of complete wretchedness drifted in as the
door closed Albert looked at his grandmother in alarm

Is she sick he faltered

Who Rachel No she aint exactly sick    Dear me Where did I put
that clean napkin

The boy stared at the kitchen door If his grandmother had said the
housekeeper was not exactly dead he might have understood But to say
she was not exactly sick

Butbut what makes her look so he stammered Andand whats she
got that on her head for And she groaned Why she MUST be sick

Mrs Snow having found the clean napkin laid it beside her husbands
plate

No she said calmly Its one of her sympathetic attacks thats what
she calls em sympathetic attacks She has em every time Laban
Keeler starts in on one of his periodics Its nerves I suppose Capn
Zelotesyour grandfathersays its everlastin foolishness Whatever
tis its a nuisance And shes so sensible other times too

Albert was more puzzled than ever Why in the world Mrs Ellis should
tie up her head and groan because the little Keeler person had gone on a
spree was beyond his comprehension

His grandmother enlightened him a trifle

You see she went on she and Laban have been engaged to be married
ever since they were young folks Its Labans weakness for liquor
thats kept em apart so long She wont marry him while he drinks and
he keeps swearin off and then breaking down Hes a good man too an
awful good man and capable as all getout when hes sober Lately that
is for the last seven or eight years beginnin with the time when that
lecturer on mesmerism and telegraphyno telepathythoughttransfers
and suchwas at the town hallRachel has been havin these sympathetic
attacks of hers She declares that alcoholtakin is a disease and
that Laban suffers when hes tipsy and that she and he are so bound up
together that she suffers just the same as he does I must say I never
noticed him sufferin very much not at the beginnin anyhowacts
more as he was havin a good timebut she seems to I dont wonder you
smile she added Tis funny in a way and its queer that such a
practical commonsense woman as Rachel Ellis is should have such a
notion Its hard on us though Dont say anything to her about it and
dont laugh at her whatever you do

Albert wanted to laugh very much But Mrs Snow he began

Mercy sakes alive You aint goin to call me Mrs Snow I hope

No of course not But Grandmother why do you and Captainyou and
Grandfather keep her and Keeler if they are so much trouble Why dont
you let them go and get someone else

Let em go Get someone else Why we COULDNT get anybody else anyone
who would be like them Theyre almost a part of our family that is
Rachel is shes been here since goodness knows when And when hes
sober Laban almost runs the lumber business Besides theyre nice
folksalmost always

Plainly the ways of South Harniss were not the ways of the world he had
known Certainly these people were Rubes and queer Rubes too Then he
remembered that two of them were his grandparents and that his immediate
future was so to speak in their hands The thought was not entirely
comforting or delightful He was still pondering upon it when his
grandfather came in from the barn

The captain said good morning in the same way he had said good night
that is he and Albert shook hands and the boy was again conscious of
the gaze which took him in from head to foot and of the quiet twinkle in
the gray eyes

Sleep well son inquired Captain Zelotes

Yes    Yes sir

Thats good I judged you was makin a pretty good try at it when I
thumped on your door this mornin Somethin new for you to be turned
out at seven eh

No sir

Eh It wasnt

No sir The rising bell rang at seven up at school We were supposed
to be down at breakfast at a quarter past

Humph You were eh Supposed to be Does that mean that you were
there

Yes sir

There was a surprised look in the gray eyes now a fact which Albert
noticed with inward delight He had taken one rise out of his
grandfather at any rate He waited hoping for another opportunity but
it did not come Instead they sat down to breakfast

Breakfast in spite of the morning sunshine at the windows was somewhat
gloomy The homesickness although not as acute as on the previous
night was still in evidence Albert felt lost out of his element
lonely And to add a touch of real miserableness the housekeeper
served and ate like a near relative of the deceased at a funeral feast
She moved slowly she sighed heavily and the bandage upon her forehead
loomed large and portentous When spoken to she seldom replied before
the third attempt Captain Zelotes lost patience

Have another egg he roared brandishing the spoon containing it at
arms length and almost under her nose Egg Egg EGG If you cant
hear it smell it Only answer for heaven sakes

The effect of this outburst was obviously not what he had hoped Mrs
Ellis stared first at the egg quivering before her face then at the
captain Then she rose and marched majestically to the kitchen The door
closed but a heartrending sniff drifted in through the crack Olive
laid down her knife and fork

There she exclaimed despairingly Now see what youve done Oh
Zelotes how many times have I told you youve got to treat her tactful
when shes this way

Captain Lote put the egg back in the bowl

DAMN he observed with intense enthusiasm

His wife shook her head

Swearin dont help it a mite either she declared Besides I
dont know what Albert here must think of you Albert who between
astonishment and a wild desire to laugh was in a critical condition
appeared rather embarrassed His grandfather looked at him and smiled
grimly

I callate one damn wont scare him to death he observed Maybe hes
heard somethin like it afore Or do they say Oh sugar up at that
school you come from he added

Albert not knowing how to reply looked more embarrassed than ever
Olive seemed on the point of weeping

Oh Zelotes how CAN you she wailed And today of all days His
very first mornin

Captain Lote relented

There there Mother he said Im sorry Forget it Sorry if I
shocked you Albert Theres times when saltwater language is the only
thing that seems to help me out    Well Mother what next Whatll
we do now

You know just as well as I do Zelotes Theres only one thing you can
do Thats go out and beg her pardon this minute Theres a dozen places
she could get right here in South Harniss without turnin her hand over
And if she should leave I dont know WHAT Id do

Leave She aint goin to leave any moren than the ships cats goin
to jump overboard Shes been here so long she wouldnt know how to
leave if she wanted to

That dont make any difference The pitcher that goes to the
wellerer

She had evidently forgotten the rest of the proverb Her husband helped
her out

Flocks together or gathers no moss or somethin eh All right
Mother dont fret There aint really any occasion to considerin
weve been through somethin like this at least once every six months
for ten years

Zelotes wont you PLEASE go and ask her pardon

The captain pushed back his chair Ill be hanged if it aint a healthy
note he grumbled when the skipper has to go and apologize to the
cook because the cooks made a fool of herself Id like to know what
kind of rum Labe drinks I never saw any but his kind that would go
to somebody elses head Two people gettin tight and only one of em
drinkin is somethin

He disappeared into the kitchen still muttering Mrs Snow smiled
feebly at her grandson

I guess you think were funny folks Albert she said But Rachel is
one hired help in a thousand and she has to be treated just so

Five minutes later Capn Lote returned He shrugged his shoulders and
sat down at his place

All right Mother all right he observed Ive been heavin ile on
the troubled waters and the seas smoothin down Shell be kind and
condescendin enough to eat with us in a minute or so

She was She came into the diningroom with the air of a saint going to
martyrdom and the remainder of the meal was eaten by the quartet almost
in silence When it was over the captain said

Well Al feel like walkin do you

Why why yes sir I guess so

Humph You dont seem very wild at the prospect Walkin aint much in
your line maybe More used to autoin perhaps

Mrs Snow put in a word Dont talk so Zelotes she said Hell
think youre makin fun of him

Who Me Not a bit of it Well Al do you want to walk down to the
lumber yard with me

The boy hesitated The quiet note of sarcasm in his grandfathers voice
was making him furiously angry once more just as it had done on the
previous night

Do you want me to he asked shortly

Why yes I callate I do

Albert without another word walked to the hatrack in the hall and
began putting on his coat Captain Lote watched him for a moment and
then put on his own

Well be back to dinner Mother he said Heave ahead Al if youre
ready

There was little conversation between the pair during the half mile
walk to the office and yards of Z Snow and Co Lumber and Builders
Hardware Only once did the captain offer a remark That was just as
they came out by the big posts at the entrance to the driveway Then he
said

Al I dont want you to get the idea from what happened at the table
just nowthat foolishness about Rachel Ellisthat your grandmother
aint a sensible woman She is and theres no better one on earth
Dont let that fact slip your mind

Albert somewhat startled by the abruptness of the observation looked
up in surprise He found the gray eyes looking down at him

I noticed you lookin at her went on his grandfather as if you was
kind of wonderin whether to laugh at her or pity her You neednt
do either Shes kindhearted and that makes her put up with Rachels
silliness Then besides Rachel herself is common sense and practical
ninetenths of the time Its always a good idea son to sail one
vyage along with a person before you decide whether to class em as A
B or just roustabout

The blood rushed to the boys face He felt guilty and the feeling made
him angrier than ever

I dont see why he burst out indignantly you should say I was
laughing atat Mrs Snow

At your grandmother

Wellyesat my grandmother I dont see why you should say that I
wasnt

Wasnt you Good Im glad of it I wouldnt anyhow Shes liable to
be about the best friend youll have in this world

To Alberts mind flashed the addition Better than you that means
but he kept it to himself

The lumber yards were on a spur track not very far from the railway
station where he had spent that miserable half hour the previous
evening The darkness then had prevented his seeing them Not that he
would have been greatly interested if he had seen them nor was he
more interested now although his grandfather took him on a personally
conducted tour between the piles of spruce and pine and hemlock and
pointed out which was which and added further details Those are two by
fours he said Or Those are larger joist different sizes This is
good clear stock as good a lot of white pine as weve got hold of for
a long spell He gave particulars concerning the handiest way to drive
a team to one or the other of the piles Albert found it rather boring
He longed to speak concerning enormous lumber yards he had seen in New
York or Chicago or elsewhere He felt almost a pitying condescension
toward this provincial grandparent who seemed to think his little piles
of two by fours so important

It was much the same perhaps a little worse when they entered the
hardware shop and the office The rows and rows of little drawers and
boxes each with samples of its contentsscrews or bolts or hooks
or knobsaffixed to its front were even more boring than the lumber
piles There was a countryfied middleaged person in overalls sweeping
out the shop and Captain Zelotes introduced him

Albert he said this is Mr Issachar Price who works around the
place here Issy let me make you acquainted with my grandson Albert

Mr Price looking over his spectacles extended a horny hand and
observed Yus yus Pleased to meet you Albert Ive heard tell of
you

Alberts private appraisal of Issy was that the latter was another
funny Rube Whatever Issys estimate of his employers grandson might
have been he also kept it to himself

Captain Zelotes looked about the shop and glanced into the office

Humph he grunted No sign or symptoms of Laban this mornin I
presume likely

Issachar went on with his sweeping

Nary one was his laconic reply

Humph Heard anything about him

Mr Price moistened his broom in a bucket of water I see Tim Kelley
on my way down street he said Tim said he run afoul of Laban along
about ten last night Said he callated Labe was on his way He was
singin Hyannis on the Cape and so Tim figgered hed got a pretty fair
start already

The captain shook his head Tut tut tut he muttered Well that
means Ill have to do office work for the next week or so Humph I
declare its too bad just now when I was countin on him to He did
not finish the sentence but instead turned to his grandson and said
Al why dont you look around the hardware store here while I open
the mail and the safe If theres anything you see you dont understand
Issyll tell you about it

He went into the office Albert sauntered listlessly to the window
and looked out So far as not understanding anything in the shop was
concerned he was quite willing to remain in ignorance It did not
interest him in the least A moment later he felt a touch on his elbow
He turned to find Mr Price standing beside him

Im all ready to tell you about it now volunteered the unsmiling
Issy Sweepins all finished up

Albert was amused I guess I can get along he said

Dont worry

_I_ aint worried none I dont believe in worryin worryin dont do
folks no good the way I look at it But longs Capn Lote wants me to
tell you about the hardware Id ruther do it now than any time Henry
Cahoons teamll be here for a load of lath in about ten minutes or so
and then Ill have to leave you This heres the shelf where we keep
the buttshinges you understand Brass along here and iron here Got
quite a stock aint we

He took the visitors arm in his mighty paw and led him from shelves
to drawers and from drawers to boxes talking all the time so the boy
thought like a catalogue Albert tried gently to break away several
times and yawned often but yawns and hints were quite lost on his
guide who was intent only upon the businessand victimin hand At
the window looking across toward the main road Albert paused longest
There was a girl in sightshe looked at that distance as if she might
be a rather pretty girland the young man was languidly interested
He had recently made the discovery that pretty girls may be quite
interesting and moreover one or two of them whom he had met at the
school danceswhen the young ladies from the Misses Bradshaws seminary
had come over duly guarded and chaperoned to onestep and foxtrot
with the young gentlemen of the schoolone or two of these young ladies
had intimated a certain interest in him So the feminine possibility
across the road attracted his noticeonly slightly of course the
sophisticated metropolitan notice is not easily arousedbut still
slightly

Come on come on urged Issachar Price I aint begun to show ye the
whole of it yet    Eh Oh Lord there comes Cahoons team now Well
I got to go Show you the rest some other time So long    Eh Capn
Lotes callin you aint he

Albert went into the office in response to his grandfathers call to
find the latter seated at an oldfashioned rolltop desk piled with
papers

Ive got to go down to the bank Al he said Some business about
a note that Laban ought to be here to see to but aint Ill be back
pretty soon You just stay here and wait for me You might be lookin
over the books if you want to I took em out of the safe and theyre
on Labes desk there pointing to the high standing desk by the window
Theyre worth lookin at if only to see how neat theyre kept A set
of books like that is an example to any young man You might be lookin
em over

He hurried out Albert smiled condescendingly and instead of looking
over Mr Keelers books walked over to the window and looked out of
that The girl was not in sight now but she might be soon At any rate
watching for her was as exciting as any amusement he could think of
about that dull hole Ah hum he wondered how the fellows were at
school

The girl did not reappear Signs of animation along the main road were
limited One or two men went by then a group of children obviously on
their way to school Albert yawned again took the silver cigarette case
from his pocket and looked longingly at its contents He wondered
what his grandfathers ideas might be on the tobacco question But his
grandfather was not there then    and he might not return for some
time    and    He took a cigarette from the case tapped with
careful carelessness its end upon the casehe would not have dreamed
of smoking without first going through the tapping processlighted the
cigarette and blew a large and satisfying cloud Between puffs he sang


 To you beautiful lady
 I raise my eyes
 My heart beautiful lady
 To your heart cries
 Come come beautiful lady
 To Paradise
 As the sweet sweet


Some one behind him said Excuse me The appeal to the beautiful lady
broke off in the middle and he whirled about to find the girl whom he
had seen across the road and for whose reappearance he had been watching
at the window standing in the office doorway He looked at her and she
looked at him He was embarrassed She did not seem to be

Excuse me she said Is Mr Keeler here

She was a pretty girl so his hasty estimate made when he had first
sighted her was correct Her hair was dark so were her eyes and her
cheeks were becomingly colored by the chill of the winter air She was
a country girl her hat and coat proved that not that they were in bad
taste or unbecoming but they were simple and their style perhaps nearer
to that which the young ladies of the Misses Bradshaws seminary had
worn the previous winter All this Albert noticed in detail later on
Just then the particular point which attracted his embarrassed attention
was the look in the dark eyes They seemed to have almost the same
disturbing quality which he had noticed in his grandfathers gray ones
Her mouth was very proper and grave but her eyes looked as if she were
laughing at him

Now to be laughed at by an attractive young lady is disturbing and
unpleasant It is particularly so when the laughter is from the
provinces and the laugheeso to speaka dignified and sophisticated
city man Albert summoned the said dignity and sophistication to his
rescue knocked the ashes from his cigarette and said haughtily

I beg your pardon

Is Mr Keeler here repeated the girl

No he is out

Will he be back soon do you think

Recollections of Mr Prices recent remark concerning the missing
bookkeepers good start came to Alberts mind and he smiled slightly
I should say not he observed with delicate irony

Is IssyI mean Mr Price busy

Hes out in the yard there somewhere I believe Would you like to have
me call him

Why yesif you pleasesir

The sir was flattering if it was sincere He glanced at her The
expression of the mouth was as grave as ever but he was still uncertain
about those eyes However he was disposed to give her the benefit of
the doubt so stepping to the side door of the officethat leading to
the yardshe opened it and shouted Price    Hey Price

There was no answer although he could hear Issachars voice and another
above the rattle of lath bundles

Price he shouted again Priice

The rattling ceased Then in the middle distance above a pile of
two by fours appeared Issachars head the features agitated and the
forehead bedewed with the moisture of honest toil

Huh yelled Issy Whats the matter Be you hollerin to me

Yes Theres some one here wants to see you

Hey

I say theres some one here who wants to see you

What for

I dont know

Well find out cant ye Im busy

Was that a laugh which Albert heard behind him He turned around but
the young ladys face wore the same grave even demure expression

What do you want to see him for he asked

I wanted to buy something

She wants to buy something repeated Albert shouting

Hey

She wants toBUYsomething It was humiliating to have to scream in
this way

Buy Buy what

What do you want to buy

A hook thats all A hook for our kitchen door Would you mind asking
him to hurry I havent much time

She wants a hook

Eh We dont keep books What kind of a book

Not bookHOOK HOOK Oh great Scott Hook HOOK Hook for a door
And she wants you to hurry

Eh Well I cant hurry now for nobody I got to load these laths
and thats all there is to it Cant you wait on him Evidently the
customers sex had not yet been made clear to the Price understanding
You can get a hook for him cant ye You know where they be I showed
ye Aint forgot so soon taint likely

The head disappeared behind the two by fours Its face was red but no
redder than Mr Speranzas at that moment

Fool rube he snorted disgustedly

Excuse me but youve dropped your cigarette observed the young lady

Albert savagely slammed down the window and turned away The dropped
cigarette stump lay where it had fallen smudging and smelling

His caller looked at it and then at him

Id pick it up if I were you she said Capn Snow HATES
cigarettes

Albert his dignity and indignation forgotten returned her look with
one of anxiety

Does he honest he asked

Yes He hates them worse than anything

The cigarette stump was hastily picked up by its owner

Wherell I put it he asked hurriedly

Why dont youOh dont put it in your pocket It will set you on
fire Put it in the stove quick

Into the stove it went all but its fragrance which lingered

Do you think you COULD find me that hook asked the girl

Ill try _I_ dont know anything about the confounded things

Oh innocently Dont you

No of course I dont Why should I

Arent you working here

Here Work HERE ME Well IshouldsayNOT

Oh excuse me I thought you must be a new bookkeeper oror a new
partner or something

Albert regarded her intently and suspiciously for some seconds before
making another remark She was as demurely grave as ever but his
suspicions were again aroused However she WAS pretty there could be
no doubt about that

Maybe I can find the hook for you he said I can try anyway

Oh thank you ever so much gratefully Its VERY kind of you to take
so much trouble

Oh airily thats all right Come on perhaps we can find it
together

They were still looking when Mr Price came panting in

Whew he observed with emphasis If anybody tells you heavin
bundles of laths aboard a truckwagon aint hard work you tell him for
me hes a liar will ye Whew And I had to do the heft of everything
cause Cahoon sent that onearmed nephew of his to drive the team A
healthy lot of good a onearmed man is to help heave lumber I says to
him says I What in time did Eh Why hello Helen Good mornin
Land sakes youre out airly aint ye

The young lady nodded Good morning Issachar she said Yes I am
pretty early and Im in a dreadful hurry The wind blew our kitchen door
back against the house last night and broke the hook I promised Father
I would run over here and get him a new one and bring it back to him
before I went to school And its quarter to nine now

Land sakes so tis AintererwhatshisnameAlbert here found
it for you yet He aint no kind of a hand to find things is he Well
have to larn him bettern that Yes indeed

Albert laughed sarcastically He was about to make a satisfyingly
crushing reproof to this piece of impertinence when Mr Price began to
sniff the air

What in tunket he demanded Snf Snf Whos been smokin in here
And cigarettes too by crimus Snf Snf Yes sir cigarettes by
crimustee Whos been smokin cigarettes in here If Capn Lote knew
anybodyd smoked a cigarette in here I dont knows he wouldnt kill
em Who done it

Albert shivered The girl with the dark blue eyes flashed a quick glance
at him I think perhaps someone went by the window when it was open
just now she suggested Perhaps they were smoking and the smoke blew
in

Eh Well maybe so Must have been a mighty rank cigarette to smell up
the whole premises like this just goin past a window Whew Gosh
no wonder they say them things are rank pison Id sooner smoke
skunkcabbage myself twouldnt smell no worse and twould be a dum
sight safer Whew    Well Helen theres about the kind of hook I
callate you need Fifteen cents ll let you out on that Cheap enough
for half the money eh Give my respects to your pa will ye Tell him
that sermon he preached last Sunday was fine but Id like it better if
hed laid it on to the Univerlists a little harder Folks that dont
believe in hell dont deserve no consideration cordin to my notion
So long Helen    Oh say he added as an afterthought I guess
you and Albert aint been introduced have ye Albert this is Helen
Kendall shes our Orthodox ministers daughter Helen this young
feller is AlbertererConsarn it Ive asked Capn Lote that name a
dozen times if I have once What is it anyway

Speranza replied the owner of the name

Thats it Sperandy This is Albert Sperandy Capn Lotes grandson

Albert and Miss Kendall shook hands

Thanks said the former gratefully and significantly

The young lady smiled

Oh youre welcome she said I knew who you were all the timeor I
guessed who you must be Capn Snow told me you were coming

She went out Issachar staring after her chuckled admiringly
Smartest girl in THIS town he observed with emphasis Head of her
class up to high school and only sixteen and threequarters at that

Captain Zelotes came bustling in a few minutes later He went to his
desk paying little attention to his grandson The latter loitered idly
up and down the office and hardware shop watching Issachar wait on
customers or rush shouting into the yard to attend to the wants of
others there Plainly this was Issachars busy day

Crimus he exclaimed returning from one such excursion and mopping
his forehead This doin two mens work aint no fun Every time Labe
goes on a time seems if trade was briskern its been for a month
Seems as if all creation and part of East Harniss had been hangin back
waitin till he had a shade on fore they come to trade Makes a feller
feel like votin the Prohibition ticket I WOULD vote it by crimustee
if I thought twould do any good Twouldnt though Labe would take
to drinkin bay rum or Florida water or somethin same as Hoppy Rogers
done when he was alive Jim Young says he went into Hoppys barbershop
once and there was Hoppy with a bottle of a new kind of hairtonic in
his hand Drummer that was here left it for a sample says Hoppy
Wanted me to try it and if I liked it he callated maybe Id buy
some I dont think I shall though he says dont taste right to
me Yes sir Jim Young swears thats true Want enough snakekiller
in that hair tonic to suit Hoppy IYes Capn Lote what is it Want
me do ye

But the captain did not as it happened want Mr Price at that time
It was Albert whose name he had called The boy went into the office and
his grandfather rose and shut the door

Sit down Al he said motioning toward a chair When his grandson had
seated himself Captain Zelotes tilted back his own desk chair upon its
springs and looked at him

Well son he said after a moment what do you think of it

Think of it I dont know exactly what

Of the place here Shop yards the whole business Z Snow and
Companywhat do you think of it

Privately Albert was inclined to classify the entire outfit as onehorse
and countrified but he deemed it wiser not to express this opinion So
he compromised and replied that it seemed to be all right

His grandfather nodded Thanks he observed dryly Glad you find it
that way Well then changin the subject for a minute or two what do
you think about yourself

About myself About me I dont understand

No I dont suppose you do Thats what I got you over here this
mornin for so as we could understandyou and me Al have you given
any thought to what youre goin to do from this on How youre goin to
live

Albert looked at him uncomprehendingly

How Im going to live he repeated Whywhy I thoughtI supposed I
was going to live with youwith you and Grandmother

Umhm I see

I just kind of took that for granted I guess You sent for me to come
here You took me away from school you know

Yes so I did You know why I took you from school

No II guess I DONT exactly I thoughtI supposed it was because
you didnt want me to go there any more

Twasnt that I dont know whether I would have wanted you to go there
or not if things had been different From what I hear it was a pretty
extravagant place and lookin at it from the outside without knowin
too much about it I should say it was liable to put a lot of foolish
and expensive notions into a boys head I may be wrong of course I
have been wrong at least a few times in my life

It was evident that he considered the chances of his being wrong in this
instance very remote His tone again aroused in the youth the feeling of
obstinacy of rebellion of desire to take the other side

It is one of the best schools in this country he declared My father
said so

Captain Zelotes picked up a pencil on his desk and tapped his chin
lightly with the blunt end Um he mused Well I presume likely he
knew all about it

He knew as much asmost people with a slight but significant
hesitation before the most

Umhm Naturally havin been schooled there himself I suppose

He wasnt schooled there My father was a Spaniard

So Ive heard    Well were kind of off the subject aint we
Lets leave your fathers nationality out of it for a while And well
leave the school too because no matter if it was the best one on earth
you couldnt go there I shouldnt feel twas right to spend as much
money as that at any school and youwell son you aint got it to
spend Did you have any idea what your father left you in the way of
tangible assets

No I knew he had plenty of money always He was one of the most famous
singers in this country

Maybe so

It WAS so hotly And he was paid enough in one week to buy this
whole townor almost Why my father

Sshh Sssh

No Im not going to hush Im proud of my father He was aa great
man Andand Im not going to stand here and have you

Between indignation and emotion he choked and could not finish the
sentence The tears came to his eyes

Im not going to have you or anyone else talk about him that way he
concluded fiercely

His grandfather regarded him with a steady but not at all unkindly
gaze

I aint runnin down your father Albert he said

Yes you are You hated him Anybody could see you hated him

The captain slowly rapped the desk with the pencil He did not answer at
once

Well he said after a moment I dont know as I ought to deny that
I dont know as I can deny it and be honest Years ago he took away from
me what amounted to threequarters of everything that made my life worth
while Some day youll know more about it than you do now and maybe
youll understand my pint of view better No I didnt like your
fatherEh What was you sayin

Albert who had muttered something was rather confused However he
did not attempt to equivocate I said I guessed that didnt make much
difference to Father he answered sullenly

I presume likely it didnt But we wont go into that question now
What Im tryin to get at in this talk were having is you and your
future Now you cant go back to school because you cant afford it All
your father left when he died wasthis is the honest truth Im tellin
you now and if Im puttin it pretty blunt its because I always think
its best to get a bad mess out of the way in a hurryall your father
left was debts He didnt leave money enough to bury him hardly

The boy stared at him aghast His grandfather leaning a little toward
him would have put a hand on his knee but the knee was jerked out of
the way

There thats over Al went on Captain Zelotes You know the worst
now and you can say What of it I mean just that What of it Bein
left without a cent but with your health and a fair chance to make
goodthat at seventeen or eighteen aint a bad lookout by any manner
of means Its the outlook _I_ had at fifteenexceptin the chanceand
I aint asked many favors of anybody since At your age or a month or
two older do you know where I was I was first mate of a threemasted
schooner At twenty I was skipper and at twentyfive by the Almighty
I owned a share in her Al all you need now is a chance to go to work
And Im goin to give you that chance

Albert gasped Do you meando you mean Ive got to be aa sailor he
stammered

Captain Zelotes put back his head and laughed laughed aloud

A sailor he repeated Ho ho No wonder you looked scared No
I want callatin to make a sailor out of you son For one reason
sailorin aint what it used to be and for another I have my doubts
whether a young feller of your bringin up would make much of a go
handlin a bunch of fomast hands the first day out No I wasnt
figgerin to send you to sea    What do you suppose I brought you
down to this place for this mornin

And then Albert understood He knew why he had been conducted through
the lumber yards about the hardware shop why his grandfather and Mr
Price had taken so much pains to exhibit and explain His heart sank

I brought you down here continued the captain because its a
firstrate idea to look a vessel over afore you ship aboard her Its
kind of late to back out after you have shipped Ever since I made up my
mind to send for you and have you live along with your grandmother and
me Ive been plannin what to do with you I knew if you was a decent
ambitious young chap youd want to do somethin towards makin a start
in life We can usethat is this business can use that kind of a chap
right now He could larn to keep books and know lumber and hardware
and how to sell and how to buy He can larn the whole thing Theres
a chance here son Its your chance Im givin it to you How big a
chance it turns out to be ll depend on you yourself

He stopped Albert was silent His thoughts were confused but out of
their dismayed confusion two or three fixed ideas reared themselves like
crags from a whirlpool He was to live in South Hamiss alwaysalways
he was to keep booksHeavens how he hated mathematics detail work of
any kindfor drunken old Keeler he was to heave lumber with
Issy Price HeOh it was dreadful It was horrible He couldnt He
wouldnt He

Captain Zelotes had been watching him his heavy brows drawing closer
together as the boy delayed answering

Well he asked for another minute Did you hear what I said

Yes

Understood did you

Yessir

Well

Albert was clutching at straws II dont know how to keep books he
faltered

I didnt suppose you did Dont imagine they teach anything as
practical as bookkeepin up at that school of yours But you can larn
cant you

II guess so

I guess so too Good Lord I HOPE so Humph You dont seem to be
jumpin for joy over the prospect Theres a half dozen smart young
fellers here in South Harniss that would I tell you that

Albert devoutly wished they had jumpedand landedbefore his arrival
His grandfathers tone grew more brusque

Dont you want to work he demanded

Why yes II suppose I do II hadnt thought much about it

Humph Then I think its time you begun Hadnt you had ANY notion of
what you wanted to do when you got out of that school of yours

I was going to college

Humph    Yes I presume likely Well after you got out of college
what was you plannin to do then

I wasnt sure I thought I might do something with my music I can
play a little I cant singthat is not well enough If I could
wistfully I should have liked to be in opera as father was of
course

Captain Zelotes only comment was a sniff or snort or combination of
both Albert went on

I had thought of writingwriting books and poems you know Ive
written quite a good deal for the school magazine And I think I should
like to be an actor perhaps I

Good God His grandfathers fist came down upon the desk before him
Slowly he shook his head

Aa poetry writer and an actor he repeated Whew    Well
there Perhaps maybe we hadnt better talk any more just now You can
have the rest of the day to run around town and sort of get acquainted
if you want to Then tomorrow mornin you and Ill come over here
together and well begin to break you in I shouldnt wonder he added
dryly if you found it kind of dull at firstcompared to that school
and poetry makin and suchbut itll be respectable and itll pay for
board and clothes and somethin to eat once in a while which may
not seem so important to you now as twill later on And some day I
callateanyhow well hopeyoull be mighty glad you did it

Poor Albert looked and felt anything but glad just then Captain
Zelotes his hands in his pockets stood regarding him He too did not
look particularly happy

Youll remember he observed or perhaps you dont know that when
your father asked us to look out for you

Albert interrupted Diddid father ask you to take care of me he
cried in surprise

Umhm He asked somebody who was with him to ask us to do just that

The boy drew a long breath Well then he said hopelessly
IllIll try

Thanks Now you run around town and see the sights Dinners at half
past twelve prompt so be on hand for that

After his grandson had gone the captain hands still in his pockets
stood for some time looking out of the window At length he spoke aloud

A play actor or a poetry writer he exclaimed Tut tut tut No use
talkin blood will tell

Issachar who was putting coal on the office fire turned his head

Eh he queried

Nothin said Captain Lote

He would have been surprised if he could have seen his grandson just at
that moment Albert on the beach whither he had strayed in his desire
to be alone safely hidden from observation behind a sand dune was
lying with his head upon his arms and sobbing bitterly

A disinterested person might have decided that the interview which had
just taken place and which Captain Zelotes hopefully told his wife that
morning would probably result in a clear comftable understandin
between the boy and mesuch a disinterested person might have decided
that it had resulted in exactly the opposite In calculating the results
to be obtained from that interview the captain had not taken into
consideration two elements one his own and the other his grandsons
These elements were prejudice and temperament



CHAPTER IV


The next morning with much the same feeling that a convict must
experience when he enters upon a life imprisonment Albert entered the
employ of Z Snow and Co Lumber and Builders Hardware The day
he would have sworn it was at least a year long The interval between
breakfast and dinner was quite six months yet the dinner hour itself
was the shortest sixty minutes he had ever known Mr Keeler had not yet
returned to his labors so there was no instruction in bookkeeping
but his grandfather gave him letters to file and long dreary columns of
invoice figures to add Twice Captain Zelotes went out and then just
as Albert settled back for a rest and breathing spell Issachar Price
appeared warned apparently by some sort of devilish intuition and
invented checking up stock and similar menial and tiresome tasks to
keep him uncomfortable till the captain returned The customers who came
in asked questions concerning him and he was introduced to at least
a dozen citizens of South Harniss who observed Sho and I want to
know when told his identity and in some instances addressed him as
Bub which was of itself a crime deserving capital punishment

That night as he lay in bed in the back bedroom he fell asleep facing
the dreary prospect of another monotonous imprisonment the following
day and the next day and the day after that and after thatand
after thatand so onand onand onforever and ever as long as
life should last This then was to be the end of all his dreams this
drudgery in a country town among these commonplace country people This
was the end of his dreams of some day writing deathless odes and sonnets
or thrilling romances of treading the boards as the hero of romantic
drama while stareyed daughters of multimillionaires gazed from the
boxes in spellbound rapture This    The thought of the stareyed
ones reminded him of the girl who had come into the office the afternoon
of his first visit to that torture chamber He had thought of her many
times since their meeting and always with humiliation and resentment It
was his own foolish tongue which had brought the humiliation upon him
When she had suggested that he might be employed by Z Snow and Co he
had replied Me Work HERE Well I should say NOT And all the time
she knowing who he was must have known he was doomed to work there He
resented that superior knowledge of hers He had made a fool of himself
but she was to blame for it Well by George he would NOT work there
He would run away he would show her and his grandfather and all the
rest what was what Night after night he fell asleep vowing to run away
to do all sorts of desperate deeds and morning after morning he went
back to that office

On the fourth morning the prodigal came home the stray lamb returned
to the foldMr Keeler returned to his desk and his duties There was
a premonition of his return at the Snow breakfast table For three days
Mrs Ellis had swathed her head in white and her soul in black For
three days her favorite accompaniment to conversation had been a groan
or a sigh Now on this fourth morning she appeared without the bandage
on her brow or the crape upon her spirit She was not hilarious but
she did not groan once and twice during the meal she actually smiled
Captain Lote commented upon the change she being absent from table
momentarily

Whew he observed in an undertone addressing his wife If it aint
a comfort to see the wrinkles on Rachels face curvin up instead of
down Im scared to death that shell go out some time in a cold spell
when shes havin one of them sympathetics of hers and her facell
freeze that way Well Albert turning to his grandson the colorsll
be histed to the truck now instead of halfmast and lifell be
somethin besides one everlastin last look at the remains Now we can
take off the mournin till the next funeral

Yes said Olive and Labanll be back too Im sure you must have
missed him awfully Zelotes

Missed him I should say so For one thing I miss havin him between
me and Issy When Labes there Is talks to him and Labe keeps on
thinkin of somethin else and so it dont worry him any I cant do
that and my eardrums get to wearin thin and that makes me nervous
Maybe youve noticed that Issys flow of conversation aint what youd
call a trickle he added turning to Albert

Albert had noticed it But he asked what makes RachelMrs
Ellisso cheerful this morning Does she know that Mr Keeler will be
back at work How does she know She hasnt seen him has she

No replied the captain She aint seen him Nobody sees him fars
that goes He generally clears out somewheres and locks himself up in
a room I judge till his vacations over I suppose thats one way to
have fun but it aint what Id call hilarious

Dont Zelotes said Mrs Snow I do wish you wouldnt call it fun

I dont but Laban seems to If he dont do it for fun I dont know
what he does it for Maybe its from a sense of duty It aint to oblige
me I know that

Albert repeated his question But how does she know he will be back
today he asked

His grandmother shook her head Thats the mysterious part about it
she whispered It makes a person think there may be somethin in the
sympathetic notion she talks so much about She dont see him at all and
yet we can always tell when hes comin back to work by her spirits If
he aint back today he will be tomorrow youll see She never misses
by more than a day _I_ think its real sort of mysterious but Zelotes
laughs at me

Captain Lotes lip twitched Yes Mother he said its about as
mysterious as the clocks strikin twelve when its noon _I_ know its
morally sartin that Labell be back aboard today or tomorrow because
his sprees dont ever last more than five days I cant swear to how
she knows but thats how _I_ knowand Im darned sure theres no
sympathy about my part Then as if realizing that he had talked more
than usual he called brusquely Come on Al come on Time we were on
the job boy

Sure enough as they passed the window of the office there seated on
the stool behind the tall desk Albert saw the diminutive figure of the
man who had been his driver on the night of his arrival He was curious
to see how the delinquent would apologize for or explain his absence
But Mr Keeler did neither nor did Captain Snow ask a question Instead
the pair greeted each other as if they had parted in that office at the
close of business on the previous day

Mornin Capn Lote said Laban quietly

Mornin Labe replied the captain just as calmly

He went on and opened his own desk leaving his grandson standing by
the door not knowing whether to speak or offer to shake hands The
situation was a little difficult particularly as Mr Keeler gave no
sign of recognition but after a glance at his employers companion
went on making entries in the ledger

Captain Zelotes looked up a moment later His gray eyes inspected
the pair and the expression on Alberts face caused them to twinkle
slightly Labe he said this is my grandson Albert the one I told
you was comin to live with us

Laban turned on the stool regarded Albert over his spectacles and
extended a hand

Pleased to meet you he said Yes yes    Yes yes yes  
Pleased to meet you Capn Lote said you was cominererAlfred
Howdy do

They shook hands Mr Keelers hand trembled a little but that was
the only symptom of his recent vacation which the youth could notice
Certain vivid remembrances of his fathers bad humor on mornings
following convivial evenings recurred to him Was it possible that this
odd precise driedup little man had been on a spree for four days It
did not seem possible He looked more as if he might be expected to rap
on the desk and ask the school to come to order

Alberts goin to take hold here with us in the office went on
Captain Lote Youll remember I spoke to you about that when we talked
about his comin Al LabeMr Keeler herewill start you in larnin
to bookkeep Hell be your first mate from now on Dont forget youre
a fomast hand yet awhile and the way for a fomast hand to get ahead
is to obey orders And dont he added with a quiet chuckle do any
playactin or poetrymakin when its your watch on deck Laban nor I
aint very strong for playactin are we Labe

Laban to whom the reference was anything but clear replied rather
vaguely that he didnt know as he was very Alberts temper flared
up again His grandfather was sneering at him once more he was always
sneering at him All right let him sneernow Some day he would be
shown He scowled and turned away And Captain Zelotes noticing the
scowl was reminded of a scowl he had seen upon the face of a Spanish
opera singer some twenty years before He did not like to be reminded of
that man

He went out soon afterward and then Laban turning to Albert asked a
few questions

How do you think youre goin to like South Harniss Ansel he asked

Albert was tempted to reply that he Keeler had asked him that very
question before but he thought it best not to do so

I dont know yet he answered carelessly Well enough I guess

Youll like it fustrate bimeby Everybody does when they get used
to it Takes some time to get used to a place dont you know it does
Ansel

My name is Albert

Eh Yes yes so tis Yes yes yes I dont know why I called you
Ansel less twas on account of my knowin an Ansel Olsen once   
Hum    Yes yes Well youll like South Harniss when you get used to
it

The boy did not answer He was of the opinion that he should die long
before the getting used process was completed Mr Keeler continued

Come on yesterdays train did you he asked

Albert looked at him Was the fellow joking He did not look as if he
was

Why no he replied I came last Monday night Dont you remember

Eh Oh yes    Yes yes yes    Last Monday night you come eh
On the night train eh He hesitated a moment and then asked Capn
Lote fetch you down from the depot

Albert stared at him openmouthed

Why no he retorted You drove me down yourself

For the first time a slight shade of embarrassment crossed the
bookkeepers features He drew a long breath

Yes he mused Yes yes yes I kind of thought Iyes yesII
thought likely I did    Yes yes course I did course I did Well
now maybe wed better be startin you in to workerAugustus Know
anything about doubleentry do you

Albert did not nor had he the slightest desire to learn But before
the first hour was over he foresaw that he was destined to learn if he
remained in that office whether he wanted to or not Laban Keeler might
be and evidently was peculiar in his ways but as a bookkeeper he was
thoroughness personified And as a teacher of his profession he was just
as thorough All that forenoon Albert practiced the first principles
of double entry and after the blessed hour for dinner came back to
practice the remainder of the working day

And so for many days Little by little he learned to invoice and
journalize and post in the ledger and all the rest of the detail of
bookkeeping Not that his instructor permitted him to do a great deal
of actual work upon the books of Z Snow and Co Those books were too
spotless and precious for that Looking over them Albert was surprised
and obliged to admit a grudging admiration at the manner in which for
the most part they had been kept Page after page of the neatest of
minute figures not a blot not a blur not an erasure So for months
then in the minor books like the daybook or journal would suddenly
break out an eruption of smudges and scrawls in the rugged handwriting
of Captain Zelotes When he first happened upon one of these Albert
unthinkingly spoke to Mr Keeler about it He asked the latter what it
meant

Laban slowly stroked his nose with his thumb and finger a habit he had

I callate I was away for a spell then he said gravely Yes
yes    Yes yes yes I was away for a little spell

He went soberly back to his desk His new assistant catching a glimpse
of his face felt a pang of real pity for the little man Of course the
reason for the hiatus in the books was plain enough He knew about those
little spells Oddly enough Laban seemed to feel sorry for them He
remembered how funny the bookkeeper had appeared at their first meeting
when one spell was just developing and the contrast between the
singing chirruping clown and the precise grave little person at the
desk struck even his youthful mind as peculiar He had read Doctor
Jekyll and Mr Hyde and now here was an example of something similar
He was beginning to like Laban Keeler although he was perfectly sure
that he should never like bookkeeping

He did not slave at the books all the time of course For stretches
sometimes lasting whole days his slavery was of another sort Then he
was working in the lumber yard with Issachar or waiting on customers in
the hardware shop The cold of winter set in in earnest now and handling
two by fours and other timber out where the raw winds swept piercingly
through ones overcoat and garments and flesh to the very bone was a
trying experience His hands were chapped and cracked even though his
grandmother had knit him a pair of enormous red mittens He appreciated
the warmth of the mittens but he hated the color Why in the name of
all that was inartistic did she choose red not a deep rich crimson
but a screeching vermilion like a firemans shirt

Issachar when he had the opportunity was a hard boss It suited Mr
Price to display his superior knowledge and to find fault with his
helpers lack of skill Alberts hot temper was at the boiling point
many times but he fought it down Occasionally he retorted in kind but
his usual and most effective weapon was a more or less delicate sarcasm
Issachar did not understand sarcasm and under rapid fire he was inclined
to lose his head

Consarn it he snapped irritably on one occasion Consarn it
Al why dont you hist up on tother end of that jist What do you
callate youre out here along of me for to look harnsome

Albert shook his head No Is he answered gravely No that
wouldnt be any use With you around nobody else has a lookin at the
handsome game Issy what do you do to your face

Do to it What do you mean by do to it

What do you do to it to make it look the way it does Dont tell me it
grew that way naturally

Grew Course it grew What kind of talks that

Issy with a face like yours how do you keep the birds away

Eh Keep the birds away Now look here just

Excuse me Did I say birds Issy I didnt mean birds likelike
crows Of course a face like yours would keep the crows away all right
enough I meant girls How do you keep the girls away I should think
they would be making love all the time

Aw you shut up Just cause youre Capn Lotes grandson I presume
likely you think you can talk any kind of talk dont ye

Not any kind Is I cant talk like you Will you teach me

Shut up Now by Crimus youyou furrineryou Speranzy

Mr Keeler appeared at the office window His shrill voice rose pipingly
in the wintry air as he demanded to know what was the trouble out there

Mr Price still foaming strode toward the window Albert laughingly
followed him

Whats the matter repeated Laban Theres enough noise for a sewin
circle Be still Is cant you for a minute Al whats the trouble

Issys been talking about his face explained Albert soberly

I aint neither I was histin up my end of a jist same as Im
paid to do and stead of helpin he stands there and heaves out talk
aboutabout

Well about what

Aw aboutabout me andand girlsand all sorts of dum foolishness
I tell ye Ive got somethin else to do beside listen to that kind of
cheap talk

Um Yes yes I see Well Al what have you got to say

Nothing Im sure I dont know what it is all about I was working as
hard as I could and all at once he began pitching into me

Pitchin into you How

Oh I dont know Something about my looks he didnt like I guess
Wanted to know if I thought I was as handsome as he was or something
like that

Eh I never neither All I said was

Mr Keeler raised his hand Seems to be a case for an umpire he
observed Um Seems if twas seems so seems so Well Captain Lotes
just comin across the road and if you say the word Ill call him in
to referee What do you say

They said nothing relevant to the subject in hand Issachar made the
only remark CrimusTEE he ejaculated Come on Al come on

The pair hurried away to resume lumber piling Laban smiled slightly and
closed the window It may be gathered from this incident that when the
captain was in charge of the deck there was little idle persiflage among
the fomast hands They like others in South Harniss did not presume
to trifle with Captain Lote Snow

So the business education of Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza progressed
At the end of the first six weeks in South Harniss he had learned a
little about bookkeeping a little about selling hardware a little
about measuring and marking lumber And it must be admitted that that
little had been acquired not because of vigorous application on the
part of the pupil but because being naturally quick and intelligent
he could not help learning something He liked the work just as little
as he had in the beginning of his apprenticeship And although he was
forgetting his thoughts of running away of attempting fortune on his
own hook he was just as rebellious as ever against a future to be spent
in that office and at that work

Outside the office and the hateful bookkeeping he was beginning to find
several real interests At the old house which had for generations been
called the Snow place he was beginning to feel almost at home He
and his grandmother were becoming close friends She was not looking for
trouble she never sat for long intervals gazing at him as if she were
guessing guessing guessing concerning him Captain Zelotes did that
but Olive did not She had taken the boy her Janies boy to her
heart from the moment she saw him and she mothered him and loved him in
a way whichso long as it was not done in publiccomforted his lonely
soul They had not yet reached the stage where he confided in her to
any great extent but that was certain to come later It was his
grandmothers love and the affection he was already beginning to feel
for her which during these first lonesome miserable weeks kept him
from perhaps turning the running away fantasy into a reality

Another inmate of the Snow household with whom Albert was
becoming better acquainted with was Mrs Rachel Ellis Their real
acquaintanceship began one Sunday forenoon when Captain Zelotes and
Olive had gone to church Ordinarily he would have accompanied them
to sit in the straightbacked old pew on a cushion which felt lumpy and
smelt ancient and musty and pretend to listen while old Mr Kendall
preached a sermon which was ancient and musty likewise

But this Sunday morning he awoke with a headache and his grandmother had
pleaded for him declaring that he ought to lay to bed a while and get
over it He got over it with surprising quickness after the church bell
ceased ringing and came downstairs to read Ivanhoe in the sitting room
He had read it several times before but he wanted to read something and
the choice of volumes in the Snow bookcase was limited He was stretched
out on the sofa with the book in his hand when the housekeeper entered
armed with a dustcloth She went to church only every other Sunday
This was one of the others without an every and she was at home

What are you readin Albert she asked after a few minutes vigorous
wielding of the dustcloth It must be awful interestin you stick at
it so close

The Black Knight was just then hammering with his battleaxe at the gate
of Front de Buefs castle not minding the stones and beams cast
down upon him from above no more than if they were thistledown or
feathers Albert absently admitted that the story was interesting The
housekeeper repeated her request to be told its name

Ivanhoe replied the boy adding as the name did not seem to convey
any definite idea to his interrogators mind Its by Walter Scott you
know

Mrs Ellis made no remark immediately When she did it was to the effect
that she used to know a colored man named Scott who worked at the hotel
once He swept out and carried trunks and such things she explained
He seemed to be a real nice sort of colored man far as ever I heard

Albert was more interested in the Black Knight of Ivanhoe than the black
man of the hotel so he went on reading Rachel sat down in a chair by
the window and looked out twisting and untwisting the dustcloth in her
lap

I presume likely lots and lots of folks have read that book aint
they she asked after another interval

What Oh yes almost everybody Its a classic I suppose

Whats that

Whats what

What you said the book was A classsomethin or other

Oh a classic Why itsits something everybody knows about
oror ought to know about One of the big things you know Likelike
Shakespeare oror Robinson Crusoe or Paradise Lost orlots of them
Its a book everybody reads and always will

I see Humph Well I never read it    I presume likely you think
thats pretty funny dont you

Albert tore himself away from the fight at the gate

Why I dont know he replied

Yes you do You think its awful funny Well you wouldnt if you knew
more about how busy Ive been all my life I aint had time to read the
way Id ought to I read a book once though that Ill never forget Did
you ever read a book called Foul Play

No    Why hold on though I think I have By Charles Reade
wasnt it

Yes thats who wrote it a man named Charles Reade Laban told me that
part of it he reads a lot Laban does I never noticed who wrote it
myself I was too interested in it to notice little extry things like
that But aint that a WONDERFUL book Aint that the best book you ever
read in all your LIFE

She dropped the dustcloth and was too excited and enthusiastic to pick
it up Albert did his best to recall something definite concerning Foul
Play The book had been in the school library and he who read almost
everything had read it along with the others

Let me see he said musingly About a shipwrecksomething about a
shipwreck in it wasnt there

I should say there was My stars above Not the common kind of
shipwreck neither the kind they have down to Setuckit Pint on the
shoals No siree This one was sunk on purpose That Joe Wylie bored
holes right down through her with a gimlet the wicked thing And that
set em afloat right out on the sea in a boat and there want anything
to eat till Robert Penfoldoh HE was the smart one hed find
anything that manhe found the barnacles on the bottom of the boat
just the same as he found out how to diffuse intelligence tied onto a
ducks leg over land knows how many legsleagues I meanof ocean But
that come later Dont you remember THAT

Albert laughed The story was beginning to come back to him

Oh sure he exclaimed I remember now Hethe Penfold fellowand
the girl landed on this island and had all sorts of adventures and fell
in love and all that sort of stuff and then her dad came and took her
back to England and sheshe did something or other there toto get the
Penfold guy out of trouble

Did somethin I should say she did Why she found out all about who
forged the letterthe note I meanthats what she done Twas Arthur
Wardlaw thats who twas And he was tryin to get Helen all the time
for himself the skinner Dont talk to me about that Arthur Wardlaw I
never could bear HIM

She spoke as if she had known the detested Wardlaw intimately from
childhood Young Speranza was hugely amused Ivanhoe was quite
forgotten

Foul Play was great stuff he observed When did you read it

Eh When Oh ever and ever so long ago When I was about twenty I
guess and laid up with the measles Thats the only time I ever was
real what you might call down sick in my life and I commenced with
measles Thats the way a good many folks commence I know but they
dont generally wait till theyre out of their teens afore they start
I was workin for Mrs Philander Bassett at the time and she says to
me Rachel she says youre on the mendin hand now wouldnt you
like a book to read I says Why maybe I would And she fetched
up three of em I can see em now all three plain as day One was
Barriers Burned Away She said that was somethin about a big fire
Well Im awful nervous about fires have been from a child so I didnt
read that And another had the queerest kind of a name if youd call it
a name at all twas She

Albert nodded

Yes he said Ive read that

Have you Well I begun to but my stars THAT wasnt any book to give
to a person with nerve symptoms I got as far as where those Indians or
whatever they was started to put redhot kettles on folkss heads and
that was enough for ME Give me somethin civilized says I or not
at all So I commenced Foul Play and I tell you I kept right on to the
end

I dont suppose she went on that there ever was a much better book
than that wrote was there

Albert temporized It is a good one he admitted

Dont seem to me there could be much better Laban says its good
though he wont go so far as to say its the very best Hes read lots
and lots of books Laban has Reads an awful lot in his spare time Hes
what youd call an educated person which is what I aint And I guess
youll say that last is plain enough without bein told she added

Her companion not exactly knowing how to answer was silent for a
moment Rachel who had picked up and was again twisting the dustcloth
returned to the subject she so delighted in

But that Foul Play book she continued Ive read till Ive pretty
nigh wore the covers off When Mrs Bassett saw how much I liked it
she gave it to me for a present I read a little bit in it every little
while I kind of fit the folks in that book to folks in real life sort
of compare em you know Do you ever do that

Albert repressing a chuckle said Sure again She nodded

Now theres General Rolleson in that book she said Do you know who
he makes me think of Capn Lote your grandpa thats who

General Rolleson as Albert remembered him was an extremely dignified
cultured and precise old gentleman Just what resemblance there might
be between him and Captain Zelotes Snow exskipper of the Olive S
he could not imagine He could not repress a grin and the housekeeper
noticed it

Seems funny to you I presume likely she said Well now you think
about it This General Rolleson man was kind of proud and sot in his
ways just as your grandpa is Albert He had a daughter he thought all
the world of so did Capn Lote Along come a person that wanted to
marry the daughter In the book twas Robert Penfold who had been
a convict In your grandpas case twas your pa who had been a
playactor So you see

Albert sat up on the sofa Hold on he interrupted indignantly Do
you mean to compare my father with awith a CONVICT I want you to
understand

Mrs Ellis held up the dustcloth Now now now she protested
Dont go puttin words in my mouth that I didnt say I dont doubt
your pa was a nice man in his way though I never met him But twant
Capn Lotes way any more than Robert Penfolds was General Rollesons

My father was famous declared the youth hotly He was one of the
most famous singers in this country Everybody knows thatthat is
everybody but Grandfather and the gang down here he added in disgust

I dont say youre wrong Laban tells me that some of those singin
folks get awful high wages more than the capn of a steamboat he says
though that seems like stretchin it to me But as I say Capn Lote
was proud and nobody but the best would satisfy him for Janie your
mother Well in that way you see he reminds me of General Rolleson in
the book

Look here Mrs Ellis Tell me about this business of Dads marrying my
mother I never knew much of anything about it

You didnt Did your pa never tell you

No

Humph Thats funny Still I dont knows as twas after all
considerin you was only a boy Probably hed have told you some day
Well I dont suppose theres any secret about it Twas town talk down
here when it happened

She told him the story of the runaway marriage Albert listened with
interest and the almost incredulous amazement with which the young
always receive tales of their parents love affairs Love for people of
his age or a trifle older was a natural and understandable thing but
for his father as he remembered him to have behaved in this way was
incomprehensible

So said Rachel in conclusion thats how it happened Thats why
Capn Lote couldnt ever forgive your father

He tossed his head Well he ought to have forgiven him he declared
He was dead lucky to get such a man for a soninlaw if you ask me

He didnt think so And he wouldnt ever mention your pas name

Oh I dont doubt that Anybody can see how he hated Father And he
hates me the same way he added moodily

Mrs Ellis was much disturbed Oh no he dont she cried You
mustnt think that Albert He dont hate you Im sure of it Hes
just kind of doubtful about you thats all He remembers how your pa
actedor how he thinks he actedand so he cant help bein the least
mite afraid the same thing may crop out in you If you just stick to
your job over there at the lumber yards and keep on tryin to please
him hell get all over that suspicion see if he dont Capn Lote
Snow is stubborn sometimes and hard to turn but hes square as a brick
Theres some that dont like him and a good many that dont agree with
himbut everybody respects him

Albert did not answer The housekeeper rose from her chair

There she exclaimed I dont know when Ive set down for so long
Goodness knows Ive got work enough to do without settin around
talkin I cant think what possessed me to do it this time unless
twas seein you readin that book She paused a moment and then said
Albert II dont want you and your grandpa to have any quarrels You
seewell you see I used to know your mother real well andand I
thought an awful sight of her I wishI do wish when you and the capn
have any trouble or anything or when you think youre liable to have
any youd come and talk it over with me Im like the feller that Laban
tells about in his dogfight yarn This feller was watchin the fight
and when they asked him to stop it afore one or tother of the dogs
was killed he just shook his head Noo he says kind of slow and
moderate I guess I shant interfere One of ems been stealin my
chickens and the other one bit me Im a friend to both parties he
says Course I dont mean it exactly that way she added with a smile
but you know what I do mean I guess WILL you talk things over with me
sometimes Albert

His answer was not very enthusiastic but he said he guessed so and
Rachel seemed satisfied with that She went on with her dusting and he
with his reading but the conversation was the first of many between the
pair The housekeeper appeared to consider his having read her beloved
Foul Play a sort of password admitting him to her lodge and that
thereafter they were in consequence to be confidants and comrades She
never hesitated to ask him the most personal questions concerning his
work his plans the friends or acquaintances he was making in the
village Some of those questions he answered honestly and fully some he
dodged some he did not answer at all Mrs Ellis never resented his not
answering I presume likely that aint any of my business is it she
would say and ask about something else

On the other hand she was perfectly outspoken concerning her own
affairs He was nearly overcome with hilarious joy when one day she
admitted that in her mind Robert Penfold the hero of Foul Play lived
again in the person of Laban Keeler

Why Mrs Ellis he cried as soon as he could trust himself to speak
at all I dont see THAT Penfold was a sixfooter wasnt he
Andand athletic you know andand a minister and youngyounger I
meanand

Rachel interrupted Yes yes I know she said And Laban is little
and not very young and whatever else he is he aint a minister I
know all that I know the outside of him dont look like Robert Penfold
at all But somewhat apologetically you see Ive been acquainted
with him so many years Ive got into the habit of seein his INSIDE
Now that sounds kind of ridiculous I know she added Sounds as if
IIwell as if I was in the habit of takin him apart like a watch
or somethin What I mean is that I know him all through Ive known him
for a long long while He aint much to look at bein so little and
sort of dried up but hes got a big fine heart and big brains He can
do most anything he sets his hand to When I used to know him when I
was a girl folks was always prophesyin that Laban Keeler would turn
out to be a whole lot moren the average He would too only for one
thing and you know what that is Its what has kept me from marryin
him all this time I swore Id never marry a man that drinks and I
never will Why if it wasnt for liquor Labe would have been runnin
his own business and gettin rich long ago He all but runs Capn Lotes
place as tis The capn and a good many other folks dont realize that
but its so

It was plain that she worshiped the little bookkeeper and except during
the periods of vacation and sympathetics was tremendously proud
of him Albert soon discovered that Mr Keelers feeling for her was
equally strong In his case though there was also a strong strain of
gratitude

Shes a fine woman Al he confided to his assistant on one occasion
A fine woman    Yes yes yes They dont make em any finer Ah
hum And not so long ago I read about a passel of darn fools arguin
that the angels in heaven was all heones    Umph    Sho sho
If men was as good as women AnselAlfredAlbert I meanwe could
start an opposition heaven down here most any time Most any timeyes
yes

It was considerable for him to say Except when on a vacation Laban was
not loquacious

Each Sunday afternoon when the weather was pleasant he came dressed
in his best black cutaway shiny at elbows and the under part of the
sleeves striped trousers and a pearl gray soft hat with a black band
a hat which looked as much out of place above his round withered little
face as a red roof might have looked on a family vault and he and the
housekeeper went for a walk

Rachel in her Sunday black bulked large beside him As Captain Zelotes
said the pair looked like a tug takin a liner out to sea



CHAPTER V


Outside of the gates of the Snow place Albert was making many
acquaintances and a few friends After church on Sundays his grandmother
had a distressful habit of suddenly seizing his arm or his coattail as
he was hurrying toward the vestibule and the sunshine of outdoors and
saying Oh Albert just a minute Heres somebody you havent met
yet I guess Elsieor Nellie or Mabel or Henry or Charlie or George
whichever it happened to bethis is my grandson Albert Speranza And
the young person to whom he was thus introduced would if a male extend
a hesitating hand give his own an embarrassed shake smile uncertainly
and say Yeseryes Pleased to meet you Or if of the other sex
would blush a little and venture the observation that it was a lovely
morning and wasnt the sermon splendid

These Sabbath introductions led to weekday or rather weekevening
meetings The principal excitement in South Harniss was going for the
mail At noon and after supper fully onehalf of the village population
journeyed to the post office Alberts labors for Z Snow and Co
prevented his attending the noon gatheringshis grandfather usually
got the morning mailbut he early formed the habit of sauntering down
street in the evening if the weather was not too cold or disagreeable
There he was certain to find groups of South Harniss youth of both
sexes talking giggling skylarking and flirting Sometimes he joined
one or the other of these groups quite as often he did not but kept
aloof and by himself for it may as well be acknowledged now if it is
not already plain that the son of Miguel Carlos Speranza had inherited
a share of his fathers temperament and selfesteem The whim of the
moment might lead him to favor these young people with his society but
he was far from considering himself under obligation to do so He had
not the least idea that he was in any way a snob he would have hotly
resented being called one but he accepted his estimate of his own worth
as something absolute and certain to be taken for granted

Now this attitude of mind had its dangers Coupled with its possessors
extraordinary good looks it was fascinating to a large percentage of
the village girls The Speranza eyes and the Speranza curls and nose
and chin were when joined with the easy condescension of the Speranza
manner a combination fatal to the susceptible The South Harniss
flappers most of them enthused over the new bookkeeper in the lumber
office They ogled and giggled and gushed in his presence and he was
tolerant or bored just as he happened to be feeling at the moment But
he never displayed a marked interest in any one of them for the very
good reason that he had no such interest To him they were merely girls
nice enough in their way perhaps but that way not his Most of the
town young fellows of his age he found had a girl and almost every
girl had a fellow there was calf love in abundance but he was a
different brand of veal

However a great man must amuse himself and so he accepted invitations
to church socials and suppers and to an occasional dance or party His
style of dancing was not that of South Harniss in the winter It was
common enough at the hotel or the tea house in July and August when
the summer people were there but not at the town hall at the Red Mens
Annual Ball in February A fellow who could foxtrot as he could swept
all before him Sam Thatcher of last years class in the high school
but now clerking in the drug store who had hitherto reigned as the best
twostepper in town suddenly became conscious of his feet Then too
the contents of the three trunks which had been sent on from school were
now in evidence No Boston or Brockton Advanced Styles held a candle
to those suits which the tailor of the late Miguel Carlos had turned out
for his patrons only son No other eighteenyearolder among the towns
yeararound residents possessed a suit of evening clothes Albert wore
his Tux at the Red Mens Ball and hearts palpitated beneath new muslin
gowns and bitter envy stirred beneath the Brockton Advanced Styles

In consequence by spring the social status of Albert Speranza among
those of his own age in the village had become something like this He
was in high favor with most of the girls and in corresponding disfavor
with most of the young fellows The girls although they agreed that he
was standoffish and kind of queer voted him just lovely all the
same Their envious beaux referred to him sneeringly among themselves
as a stuckup dude Some one of them remembered having been told that
Captain Zelotes years before had been accustomed to speak of his hated
soninlaw as the Portygee Behind his back they formed the habit
of referring to their new rival in the same way The first time Albert
heard himself called a Portygee was after prayer meeting on Friday
evening when obeying a whim he had walked home with Gertie Kendrick
quite forgetful of the fact that Sam Thatcher who aspired to be
Gerties steady was himself waiting on the church steps for that
privilege

Even then nothing might have come of it had he and Sam not met in the
path as he was sauntering back across lots to the main road and home It
was a brilliant moonlight night and the pair came together literally
at the bend where the path turns sharply around the corner of Elijah
Doanes cranberry shanty Sam plowing along head down and hands in his
pockets swung around that corner and bumped violently into Albert
who a cigarette between his lipsout here in the fields away from
civilization and Captain Zelotes was a satisfyingly comfortable place
to smoke a cigarettewas dreaming dreams of a future far away from
South Harniss Sam had been thinking of Gertie Albert had not She had
been a mere incident of the evening he had walked home with her because
he happened to be in the mood for companionship and she was rather
pretty and always talkative His dreams during the stroll back alone
in the moonlight had been of lofty things of poetry and fame and
high emprise giggling Gerties had no place in them It was distinctly
different with Sam Thatcher

They crashed together gasped and recoiled

Oh Im sorry exclaimed Albert

Cant you see where youre goin you darned Portygee halfbreed
demanded Sam

Albert who had stepped past him turned and came back

What did you say he asked

I said you was a darned halfbreed and you are Youre a nogood
Portygee like your father

It was all he had time to say For the next few minutes he was too busy
to talk The Speranzas father and son possessed temperament also they
possessed temper Sams face usually placid and goodnatured for Sam
was by no means a bad fellow in his way was fiery red Alberts on the
contrary went perfectly white He seemed to settle back on his heels
and from there almost to fly at his insulter Five minutes or so later
they were both dusty and dirty and dishevelled and bruised but Sam was
pretty thoroughly licked For one thing he had been taken by surprise
by his adversarys quickness for another Alberts compulsory training
in athletics at school gave him an advantage He was by no means an
unscarred victor but victor he was Sam was defeated and very much
astonished He leaned against the cranberry house and held on to his
nose It had been a large nose in the beginning it was larger now

Albert stood before him his facewhere it was not a pleasing
combination of black and bluestill white

If youif you speak of my father or me again like that he panted
IllIll kill you

Then he strode off a bit wobbly on his legs but with dignity

Oddly enough no one except the two most interested ever knew of this
encounter Albert of course did not tell He was rather ashamed of it
For the son of Miguel Carlos Speranza to conquer dragons was a worthy
and heroic business but there seemed to be mighty little heroism in
licking Sam Thatcher behind Lije Doanes cranberry shack And Sam did
not tell Gertie next day confided that she didnt care two cents for
that stuckup Al Speranza anyway she had let him see her home only
because Sam had danced so many times with Elsie Wixon at the ball
that night So Sam said nothing concerning the fight explaining the
condition of his nose by saying that he had run into something in the
dark And he did not appear to hold a grudge against his conqueror on
the contrary when others spoke of the latter as a sissy Sam defended
him He may be a dude said Sam I dont say he aint But he aint
no sissy

When pressed to tell why he was so certain his answer was Because he
dont act like one It was not a convincing answer the general opinion
being that that was exactly how Al Speranza did act

There was one young person in the village toward whom Albert found
himself making exceptions in his attitude of serenely impersonal
tolerance That person was Helen Kendall the girl who had come into his
grandfathers office the first morning of his stay in South Harniss He
was forced to make these exceptions by the young lady herself When he
met her the second timewhich was after church on his first Sundayhis
manner was even more loftily reserved than usual He had distinct
recollections of their first conversation His own part in it had not
been brilliant and in it he had made the absurd statementabsurd in
the light of what came afterthat he was certainly NOT employed by Z
Snow and Co

So he was cool and superior when his grandmother brought them together
after the meeting was over If Helen noticed the superiority she was
certainly not overawed by it for she was so simple and natural and
pleasant that he was obliged to unbend and be natural too In fact
at their third meeting he himself spoke of the interview in the
lumber office and again expressed his thanks for warning him of his
grandfathers detestation of cigarettes

Gee he exclaimed Im certainly glad that you put me on to the old
boys feelings I think hed have murdered me if he had come back and
found me puffing a Pall Mall in there

She smiled He does hate them doesnt he she said

Hate them I should say he did Hating cigarettes is about the only
point where he and Issy get along without an argument If a traveler for
a hardware house comes into the office smoking a cig Issy opens all the
windows to let the smell out and Grandfather opens the door to throw
the salesman out Well not exactly to throw him out of course but he
never buys a single cents worth of a cigarette smoker

Helen glanced at him You must be awfully glad youre not a traveling
salesman she said demurely

Albert did not know exactly what to make of that remark He in his
turn looked at her but she was grave and quite unconcerned

Why he asked after a moment

Whywhat

Why ought I to be glad Im not a traveling salesman

Oh I dont know It just seemed to me that you ought thats all

But why

Well if you were you wouldnt make a great hit with your grandfather
would you

Eh    Oh you mean because I smoke Say YOURE not silly enough to
be down on cigarettes the way grandfather is are you

Noo Im not down on them especially Im not very well acquainted
with them

Neither is he He never smoked one in his life Its just country
prejudice thats all

Well I live in the country too you know

Yes but youre different

How do you know I am

Oh because any one can see you are The manner in which this remark
was made a manner implying a wide knowledge of humanity and a hint of
personal interest and discriminating appreciation had been found quite
effective by the precocious young gentleman uttering it With variations
to suit the case and the individual it had been pleasantly received by
several of the Misses Bradshaws pupils He followed it with another
equally tried and trustworthy

Say he added would YOU rather I didnt smoke

The obvious reply should have been Oh would you stop if I asked you
to But Helen Kendall was a most disconcerting girl Instead of purring
a pleased recognition of the implied flattery she laughed merrily The
Speranza dignity was hurt

What is there to laugh at he demanded Are you laughing at me

The answer was as truthful as truth itself

Why of course I am she replied and then completed his discomfiture
by adding Why should I care whether you smoke or not You had better
ask your grandfather that question I should think

Now Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza had not been accustomed to this sort
of treatment from young persons of the other sex and he walked away in
a huff But the unusual is always attractive and the next time he and
Miss Kendall met he was as gracious and cordial as ever But it was
not long before he learned that the graciousness was in her case a
mistake Whenever he grew lofty she took him down laughed at him with
complete frankness and refused to treat him as anything but a boy So
they gradually grew friendly and when they met at parties or church
socials he spent most of the time in her company or rather he would
have so spent it had she permitted But she was provokingly impartial
and was quite as likely to refuse a dance with him to sit out one
with Sam Thatcher or Ben Hammond or any other village youth of her
acquaintance However although she piqued and irritated him he was
obliged to admit to his inner consciousness that she was the most
interesting person he had yet discovered in South Harniss also that
even in the eyes of such connoisseurs as his fellow members of the
senior class at school she would have been judged a good looker in
spite of her country clothes

He met her father of course The Reverend Mr Kendall was a dreamy
little old gentleman with white hair and the stooped shoulders of a
student Everybody liked him and it was for that reason principally
that he was still the occupant of the Congregational pulpit for to
quote Captain Zelotes his sermons were inclined to be like the sandy
road down to Setuckit Point ten mile long and dry all the way He was
a widower and his daughter was his companion and managing housekeeper
There was a halfgrown girl one of the numerous Price family a cousin
of Issachars who helped out with the sweeping dishwashing and
cooking but Helen was the real head of the household

And shes a capable one too declared Mrs Snow when at supper one
evening Helens name had come into the conversation I declare when I
was there yesterday to see the minister about readin poetry to us at
sewincircle next Monday that parlor was as neat as wax And twas all
Helens work that kept it so that was plain enough You could see her
way of settin a vase or puttin on a table cloth wherever you looked
Nobody else has just that way And she does it after school or before
school or most any odd time And whatever tis is done right

The housekeeper put in a word Theres no doubt about that she said
and there aint any more doubt that she dont get much help from her pa
or that Maria B There were so many Prices within the township limits
that individuals were usually distinguished by their middle initial As
for Mr Kendall went on Rachel he moves with his head in the clouds
and his feet cruisin with nobody at the wheel twothirds of the time
Emma Smith says to me yesterday says she Mr Kendall is a saint on
earth aint he says she Yes says I and hell be one in heaven
any minute if he goes stumblin acrost the road in front of Doctor
Hollidays automobile the way I see him yesterday The doctor put on
the brakes with a slam and a yell The minister stopped right there in
the middle of the road with the front wheels of that auto not MOREN two
foot from his old baggy trousers knees and says he Eh Did you want
me Doctor The doctor fetched a long breath Why no Mr Kendall
he says I didnt but I come darn nigh gettin you I dont know what
WOULD become of him if he didnt have Helen to look out for him

As they came to know each other better their conversation dealt with
matters more personal They sometimes spoke of plans for the future
Alberts plans and ambitions were lofty but rather vague Helens
were practical and definite She was to graduate from high school that
spring Then she was hoping to teach in the primary school there in the
village the selectmen had promised her the opportunity

But of course she said I dont mean to stay here always When I
can after I have saved some money and if Father doesnt need me
too badly I shall go away somewhere to Bridgewater or perhaps to
Radcliffe and study I want to specialize in my teaching you know

Albert regarded her with amused superiority

I dont see why on earth you are so anxious to be a schoolmarm he
said Thats the last job Id want

Her answer was given promptly but without the least trace of temper
That was one of the most provoking things about this girl she would not
lose her temper He usually lost his trying to make her She spoke now
pleasantly and deliberately but as if she were stating an undesirable
fact

I think it would be the last one you would get she said

Why Great Scott I guess I could teach school if I wanted to But you
bet I wouldnt want to    NOW what are you laughing at

Im not laughing

Yes you are I can always tell when youre laughing you get that look
in your eyes that sort ofofOh I cant tell you what kind of look
it is but it makes me mad Its the same kind of look my grandfather
has and I could punch him for it sometimes Why should you and he think
Im not going to amount to anything

I dont think so And Im sure he doesnt either And I wasnt laughing
at you Or if I was itit was only because

Well because what

Oh because you are so AWFULLY sure you knowwell know more than most
people

Meaning Im stuck on myself I suppose Well now I tell you Im
not going to hang around in this onehorse town all my life to please
grandfather or any one else

When he mentioned his determination to win literary glory she was always
greatly interested Dreams of histrionic achievement were more coldly
received The daughter of a New England country clergyman even in these
days of broadening horizons could scarcely be expected to look with
favor upon an actors career

June came and with it the first of the summer visitors For the next
three months Albert was happy with a new set of acquaintances They were
HIS kind these young folks from the city and his spare moments were
for the most part spent in their society He was popular with them too
Some of them thought it queer that he should be living all the year in
the village and keeping books for a concern like Z Snow and Co but
juvenile society is tolerant and a youth who could sing passably dance
wonderfully and above all was as beautifully picturesque as Albert
Speranza was welcomed especially by the girls So the Saturdays and
Sundays and evenings of that summer were pleasant for him He saw little
of Helen or Gertie Kendrick while the hotel or the cottages remained
open

Then came the fall and another long dreary winter Albert plodded on at
his desk or in the yard following Mr Keelers suggestions obeying his
grandfathers orders tormenting Issy doing his daily stint because he
had to not because he liked it For amusement he read a good deal went
to the usual number of sociables and entertainments and once took part
in amateur theatricals a play given by the church society in the
town hall There was where he shone As the dashing young hero he was
resplendent Gertie Kendrick gazed upon him from the third settee
center with shining eyes When he returned home after it was over his
grandmother and Mrs Ellis overwhelmed him with praises

I declare you was perfectly splendid Albert exclaimed Olive I was
so proud of you I didnt know what to do

Rachel looked upon him as one might look upon a god from Olympus

All I could think of was Robert Penfold she said I says so to
Laban Laban says I aint he Robert Penfold and nobody else There
you was tellin that Hannibal Ellis that you was innocent and some day
the world would know you was just the way Robert Penfold done in the
book I never did like that Hannie Ellis

Mrs Snow smiled Mercy Rachel she said I hope youre not blamin
Hannie because of what he did in that play That was his part he had to
do it

But Rachel was not convinced He didnt have to be so everlastin mean
and spiteful about it anyhow she declared But there that family
of Ellises never did amount to nothin much But as I said to Laban
Albert you was Robert Penfold all over

What did Labe say to that asked Albert laughing

He never had a chance to say nothin Afore he could answer that Maria
B Priceshe was settin right back of me and eatin molasses candy out
of a rattly paper bag till I thought I SHOULD dieshe leaned forward
and she whispered He looks more to me like that Stevie D that used to
work for Capn Crowell over to the Center Stevie D had curly hair like
that and HE was part Portygee you remember though there was a little
nigger blood in him too she says I could have shook her And then
she went to rattlin that bag again

Even Mr Keeler congratulated him at the office next morning You done
well Al he said Yesyesyes You done fustrate fustrate

His grandfather was the only one who refused to enthuse

Well inquired Captain Zelotes sitting down at his desk and glancing
at his grandson over his spectacles do you callate to be able to get
down to earth this mornin far enough to figger up the payroll You can
put what you made from playactin on a separate sheet Its about as
much as the average person makes at that job he added

Alberts face flushed There were times when he hated his grandfather
Mr Keeler a moment later put a hand on his shoulder

You mustnt mind the old man Al he whispered I expect that seein
you last night brought your dads job back to him strong He cant bear
playactin you know on your dads account Yesyes That was it
Yesyesyes

It may have been a truthful explanation but as an apology it was a
limited success

My father was a gentleman at any rate snapped Albert Laban opened
his mouth to reply but closed it again and walked back to his books

In May which was an unusually balmy month the Congregational Sunday
School gave an automobile excursion and boxluncheon party at High Point
Light down at Trumet As Rachel Ellis said it was pretty early for
picnickin but if the Almightys season was ahead of time there didnt
seem to be any real good reason why one of his Sunday schools shouldnt
be And which was the principal excuse for the hurry the hotel busses
could be secured which would not be the case after the season opened

Albert went to the picnic He was not very keen on going but his
grandfather had offered him a holiday for the purpose and it was one
of his principles never to refuse a chance to get away from that office
Besides a number of the young people of his age were going and Gertie
Kendrick had been particularly insistent

You just MUST come Al she said It wont be any fun at all if you
dont come

It is possible that Gertie found it almost as little fun when he
did come He happened to be in one of his moods that day Portygee
streaks his grandfather termed these moods and told Olive that they
were that playactor breakin out in him He talked but little during
the ride down in the bus refused to sing when called upon and after
dinner when the dancing in the pavilion was going on stepped quietly
out of the side door and went tramping along the edge of the bluff
looking out over the sea or down to the beach where one hundred and
fifty feet below the big waves were curling over to crash into a creamy
mass of froth and edge the strand with lacy ripples

The high clay bluffs of Trumet are unique No other part of the Cape
shows anything just like them High Point Light crowns their highest
and steepest point and is the flashing beacon the rays of which spell
America to the incoming liner Boston bound

Along the path skirting the edge of the bluff Albert strolled his hands
in his pockets and his thoughts almost anywhere except on the picnic
and the picnickers of the South Harniss Congregational Church His
particular mood on this day was one of discontent and rebellion against
the fate which had sentenced him to the assistant bookkeepers position
in the office of Z Snow and Co At no time had he reconciled himself to
the idea of that position as a permanent one some day somehow he was
going to break away and domarvelous things But occasionally and
usually after a disagreeable happening in the office he awoke from his
youthful day dreams of glorious futures to a realization of the dismal
today

The happening which had brought about realization in this instance was
humorous in the eyes of twothirds of South Harnisss population They
were chuckling over it yet The majority of the remaining third were
shocked Albert who was primarily responsible for the whole affair was
neither amused nor shocked he was angry and humiliated

The Reverend Seabury Calvin of Providence R I had arrived in town
and opened his summer cottage unusually early in the season What
was quite as important Mrs Seabury Calvin had arrived with him The
Reverend Calvin whose stay was in this case merely temporary was
planning to build an addition to his cottage porch Mrs Calvin who was
the head of the summer Welfare Workers whatever they were had called
a meeting at the Calvin house to make Welfare plans for the season

The lumber for the new porch was ordered of Z Snow and Co The Reverend
Calvin ordered it himself in person Albert received the order

I wish this delivered tomorrow without fail said Mr Calvin Albert
promised

But promises are not always easy to keep One of Z Snow and Cos teams
was busy hauling lumber for the new schoolhouse at Bayport The other
Issachar had commandeered for deliveries at Harniss Center and refused
to give up his claim And Laban Keeler as it happened was absent
on one of his vacations Captain Zelotes was attending a directors
meeting at Osham and from there was going to Boston for a days stay

The ships in your hands Al he had said to his grandson Let me see
how you handle her

So in spite of Alberts promise the Calvin lumber was not delivered on
time The Reverend gentleman called to ask why His manner was anything
but receptive so far as excuses were concerned

Young man he said loftily I am accustomed to do business with
business people Did you or did you not promise to deliver my order
yesterday

Why yes sir I promised but we couldnt do it We

I dont care to know why you didnt do it The fact that you did not is
sufficient Will that order of mine be delivered today

If it is a possible thing Mr Calvin it

Pardon me Will it be delivered

The Speranza temper was rising Yes said the owner of that temper
succinctly

Does yes mean yes in this case or does it mean what it meant before

I have told you why

Never mind Young man if that lumber is not delivered today I shall
cancel the order Do you understand

Albert swallowed hard I tell you Mr Calvin that it shall be
delivered he said And it will be

But delivering it was not so easy The team simply could NOT be taken
off the schoolhouse job fulfillment of a contract was involved there
And the other horse had gone lame and Issachar swore by all that was
solemn that the animal must not be used

Let old Calvin wait till tomorrow said Issy You can use the big
team then And Capn Lotell be home besides

But Albert was not going to let old Calvin wait That lumber was going
to be delivered if he had to carry it himself stick by stick He asked
Mr Price if an extra team might not be hired

Aint none said Issy Besides whered your granddads profits be
if you spent money hirin extry teams to haul that little mite of stuff
Ive been in this business a good long spell and I tell you

He did not get a chance to tell it for Albert walked off and left him
At halfpast twelve that afternoon he engaged Vessie Youngchristened
Sylvester Young and a brother to the driver of the depot wagonto
haul the Calvin lumber in his rickety fragrant old wagon Simpson
Mullencommonly called Simpwas to help in the delivery

Against violent protests from Issy who declared that Ves Youngs
rattletrap want fit to do nothin but haul fish heads to the
fertilizer factory the Calvin beams and boards were piled high on
the wagon and with Ves on the drivers seat and Simp perched like a
disreputable carrion crow on top of the load the equipage started

There exclaimed Albert with satisfaction He cant say it wasnt
delivered this time according to promise

Godfreys snorted Issy gazing after the departing wagon He wont be
able to say nothin when he sees that gitupand smells it Ves carts
everything in that cart from dead cows to gurry barrels Whew Id
hate to have to set on that porch when twas built of that lumber And
unless Im mistook Ves and Simp had been havin a little somethin
strong to take too

Mr Price as it happened was not mistook Mr Young had as the
South Harniss saying used to be had a jug come down on the train from
Boston that very morning The jug was under the seat of his wagon and
its contents had already been sampled by him and by Simp The journey to
the Calvin cottage was enlivened by frequent stops for refreshment

Consequently it happened that just as Mrs Calvins gathering of
Welfare Workers had reached the cake and chocolate stage in their
proceedings and just as the Reverend Mr Calvin had risen by invitation
to say a few words of encouragement the westerly wind blowing in at
the open windows bore to the noses and ears of the assembled faithful a
perfume and a sound neither of which was sweet

Above the rattle and squeak of the Young wagon turning in at the Calvin
gate arose the voices of Vessie and Simp uplifted in song

Heres to the good old whiskey drink er daown sang Mr Young


 Heres to the good old whiskey
 Drink er daown
 Heres to the good old whiskey
 It makes you feel so frisky
 Drink er


Git up there blank blank ye What the blankety blank you stoppin here
for Git up

The horse was not the only creature that got up Mrs Calvin rose from
her chair and gazed in horror at the window Her husband being already
on his feet could not rise but he broke off short the opening sentence
of his few words and stared and listened Each Welfare Worker stared
and listened also

Git up you blankety blank blank repeated Ves Young with cheerful
enthusiasm Mr Mullen from the top of the load of lumber caroled
dreamily on


 Heres to the good old rum
 Drink er daown
 Heres to the good old rum
 Drink er daown
 Heres to the good old rum
 Aint you glad that youve got some
 Drink er daown Drink er daown
 Drink er daown


And floating as it were upon the waves of melody came the odor of the
Young wagon an odor combining deceased fish and late lamented cow and
goodness knows what beside

The dissipated vehicle stopped beneath the parlor windows of the Calvin
cottage Mr Young called to his assistant

Here we be Simp he yelled Aall ashore thats goin ashore Wake
up there you unmentionably described old rum barrel and help unload
this everlastingly condemned lumber

Mr Calvin rushed to the window What does this mean he demanded in
frothing indignation

Vessie waved at him reassuringly Sall right Mr Calvin he shouted
Heres your lumber from Zelotes Snow and Co South Harniss Mass U
S A Sall right Let er go Simp Let er blanketyblank go

Mr Mullen responded with alacrity and a whoop A half dozen boards
crashed to the ground beneath the parlor windows Mrs Calvin rushed to
her husbands side

This is DREADFUL Seabury she cried Send those creatures andand
that horrible wagon away at once

The Reverend Calvin tried to obey orders He commanded Mr Young to go
away from there that very moment Vessie was surprised

Aint this your lumber he demanded

It doesnt make any difference whether it is or not I

Didnt you tell Z Snow and Co that this lumberd got to be delivered
today or youd cancel the order

Never mind That is my business sir You

Hold on Hoold on _I_ got a business too My business is deliverin
what Im paid to deliver Al Speranzy he says to me Ves he says if
you dont deliver that lumber to old man Calvin today you dont get no
money see Will you deliver it Says I You bet your crashetyblank
life Ill hic dliver it What I say Ill do Ill do And Im
deliverin it aint I Hey Aint I Well then what the And so
forth and at length while Mrs Calvin collapsed half fainting in an
easychair and horrified Welfare Workers covered their earsand longed
to cover their noses

The lumber was delivered that day Its delivery was from the viewpoint
of Messrs Young and Mullen a success The spring meeting of the
Welfare Workers was not a success

The following day Mr Calvin called at the office of Z Snow and Co He
had things to say and said them Captain Zelotes who had returned from
Boston listened Then he called his grandson

Tell him what youve just told me Mr Calvin he said

The reverend gentleman told it with added details

And in my opinion if youll excuse me Captain Snow he said in
conclusion this young man knew what he was doing when he sent those
drunken scoundrels to my house He did it purposely I am convinced

Captain Zelotes looked at him

Why he asked

Why becausebecause ofof what I said to himererwhen I called
here yesterday morning HeI presume he took offense andand this
outrage is the result I am convinced that

Wait a minute What did you say for him to take offense at

I demanded that order should be delivered as promised I am accustomed
to do business with business men and

Hold on just a minute more Mr Calvin We dont seem to be gettin at
the clam in this shell as fast as wed ought to Al what have you got
to say about all this business

Albert was white almost as white as when he fought Sam Thatcher but as
he stood up to Sam so also did he face the irate clergyman He told
of the latters visit to the office of the threat to cancel the order
unless delivery was promised that day of how his promise to deliver was
exacted of his effort to keep that promise

I HAD to deliver it Grandfather he said hotly He had all but
called me a liar andand by George I wasnt going to

His grandfather held up a warning hand

Sshh Ssh he said Go on with your yarn boy

Albert told of the lame horse of his effort to hire another team and
finally how in desperation he had engaged Ves Young as a last resort
The captains face was serious but there was the twinkle under his heavy
brows He pulled at his beard

Humph he grunted Did you know Ves and Simp had been drinkin when
you hired em

Of course I didnt After they had gone Issy said he suspected that
they had been drinking a little but _I_ didnt know it All I wanted
was to prove to HIM with a motion toward Mr Calvin that I kept my
word

Captain Zelotes pulled at his beard All right Al he said after a
moment you can go

Albert went out of the private office After he had gone the captain
turned to his irate customer

Im sorry this happened Mr Calvin he said and if Keeler or I had
been here it probably wouldnt But he added as far as I can see
the boy did what he thought was the best thing to do And the twinkle
reappeared in the gray eyes you sartinly did get your lumber when
twas promised

Mr Calvin stiffened He had his good points but he suffered from what
Laban Keeler once called ingrowin importance and this ailment often
affected his judgment Also he had to face Mrs Calvin upon his return
home

Do I understand he demanded that you are excusing that young man
for putting that outrage upon me

Well as I say Im sorry it happened But honest Mr Calvin I
dont knows the boys to blame so very much after all He delivered
your lumber and thats somethin

Is that all you have to say Captain Snow Is thatthat impudent young
clerk of yours to go unpunished

Why yes I guess likely he is

Then I shall NEVER buy another dollars worth of your house again
sir

Captain Zelotes bowed Im sorry to lose your trade Mr Calvin he
said Good mornin

Albert at his desk in the outer office was waiting rebelliously to be
called before his grandfather and upbraided And when so called he was
in a mood to speak his mind He would say a few things no matter what
happened in consequence But he had no chance to say them Captain
Zelotes did not mention the Calvin affair to him either that day or
afterward Albert waited and waited expecting trouble but the trouble
so far as his grandfather was concerned did not materialize He could
not understand it

But if in that office there was silence concerning the unusual delivery
of the lumber for the Calvin porch outside there was talk enough and
to spare Each Welfare Worker talked when she reached home and the story
spread Small boys shouted after Albert when he walked down the main
street demanding to know how Ves Youngs cart was smellin these days
When he entered the post office some one in the crowd was almost sure to
hum Heres to the good old whiskey drink her down On the train
on the way to the picnic girls and young fellows had slyly nagged him
about it The affair and its consequence were the principal causes of
his mood that day this particular Portygee streak was due to it

The path along the edge of the high bluff entered a grove of scraggy
pitch pines about a mile from the lighthouse and the picnic ground
Albert stalked gloomily through the shadows of the little grove and
emerged on the other side There he saw another person ahead of him on
the path This other person was a girl He recognized her even at this
distance She was Helen Kendall

She and he had not been quite as friendly of late Not that there was
any unfriendliness between them but she was teaching in the primary
school and as her father had not been well spent most of her evenings
at home During the early part of the winter he had called occasionally
but somehow it had seemed to him that she was not quite as cordial or
as interested in his society and conversation as she used to be It was
but a slight indifference on her part perhaps but Albert Speranza
was not accustomed to indifference on the part of his feminine
acquaintances So he did not call again He had seen her at the picnic
ground and they had spoken but not at any length

And he did not care to speak with her now He had left the pavilion
because of his desire to be alone and that desire still persisted
However she was some little distance ahead of him and he waited in the
edge of the grove until she should go over the crest of the little hill
at the next point

But she did not go over the crest Instead when she reached it she
walked to the very edge of the bluff and stood there looking off at the
ocean The sea breeze ruffled her hair and blew her skirts about her and
she made a pretty picture But to Albert it seemed that she was standing
much too near the edge She could not see it of course but from where
he stood he could see that the bank at that point was much undercut by
the winter rains and winds and although the sod looked firm enough from
above in reality there was little to support it Her standing there
made him a trifle uneasy and he had a mind to shout and warn her
He hesitated however and as he watched she stepped back of her own
accord He turned reentered the grove and started to walk back to the
pavilion

He had scarcely done so when he heard a short scream followed by a
thump and a rumbling rattling sound He turned like a flash his heart
pounding violently

The bluff edge was untenanted A semicircular section of the sod where
Helen had stood was missing From the torn opening where it had been
rose a yellow cloud of dust



CHAPTER VI


A goodly number of the South Harniss natives those who had not seen
him play tennis would have been willing to swear that running was for
Albert Speranza an impossibility His usual gait was a rather languid
saunter They would have changed their minds had they seen him now

He ran along that path as he had run in school at the last track meet
where he had been second in the hundredyard dash He reached the spot
where the sod had broken and dropping on his knees looked fearfully
over The dust was still rising the sand and pebbles were still
rattling in a diminishing shower down to the beach so far below But he
did not see what he had so feared to see

What he did see however was neither pleasant nor altogether
reassuring The bluff below the sod at its top dropped sheer and
undercut for perhaps ten feet Then the sand and clay sloped outward and
the slope extended down for another fifty feet its surface broken by
occasional clinging chunks of beach grass Then it broke sharply again
a straight drop of eighty feet to the mounds and dunes bordering the
beach

Helen had of course fallen straight to the upper edge of the slope
where she had struck feet first and from there had slid and rolled to
the very edge of the long drop to the beach Her skirt had caught in
the branches of an enterprising bayberry bush which had managed to find
roothold there and to this bush and a clump of beach grass she was
clinging her hands outstretched and her body extended along the edge of
the clay precipice

Albert gasped

Helen he called breathlessly

She turned her head and looked up at him Her face was white but she
did not scream

Helen cried Albert again Helen do you hear me

Yes

Are you badly hurt

No No I dont think so

Can you hold on just as you are for a few minutes

Yes II think so

Youve got to you know Here Youre not going to faint are you

No II dont think I am

You cant You mustnt Here Dont you do it Stop

There was just a trace of his grandfather in the way he shouted the
order Whether or not the vigor of the command produced the result is a
question but at any rate she did not faint

Now you stay right where you are he ordered again And hang on as
tight as you can Im coming down

Come down he did swinging over the brink with his face to the bank
dropping on his toes to the upper edge of the slope and digging boots
and fingers into the clay to prevent sliding further

Hang on he cautioned over his shoulder Ill be there in a second
There Now wait until I get my feet braced Now give me your handyour
left hand Hold on with your right

Slowly and cautiously clinging to his hand he pulled her away from the
edge of the precipice and helped her to scramble up to where he clung
There she lay and panted He looked at her apprehensively

Dont go and faint now or any foolishness like that he ordered
sharply

No no I wont Ill try not to But how are we ever going to climb
upup there

Above them and at least four feet out of reach even if they stood up
and that would be a frightfully risky proceeding the sod projected over
their heads like the eaves of a house

Helen glanced up at it and shuddered

Oh how CAN we she gasped

We cant And we wont try

Shall we call for help

Not much use Nobody to hear us Besides we can always do that if
we have to I think I see a way out of the mess If we cant get up
perhaps we can get down

Get DOWN

Yes it isnt all as steep as it is here I believe we might sort of
zigzag down if we were careful You hold on here just as you are Im
going to see what it looks like around this next point

The point was merely a projection of the bluff about twenty feet away
He crawfished along the face of the slope until he could see beyond it
Helen kept urging him to be carefuloh be careful

Of course Ill be careful he said curtly I dont want to break my
neck Yesyes by George it IS easier around there We could get down
a good way Here here dont start until you take my hand And be sure
your feet are braced before you move Come on now

II dont believe I can

Of course you can Youve GOT to Come on Dont look down Look at the
sand right in front of you

Getting around that point was a decidedly ticklish operation but they
managed it he leading the way making sure of his foothold before
moving and then setting her foot in the print his own had made On the
other side of the projection the slope was less abrupt and extended much
nearer to the ground below They zigzagged down until nearly to the edge
of the steep drop Then Albert looked about for a new path to safety He
found it still farther on

It takes us down farther he said and there are bushes to hold on to
after we get there Come on Helen Brace up now be a sport

She was trying her best to obey orders but being a sport was no slight
undertaking under the circumstances When they reached the clump of
bushes her guide ordered her to rest

Just stop and catch your breath he said The rest is going to be
easier I think And we havent so very far to go

He was too optimistic It was anything but easy in fact the last
thirty feet was almost a tumble owing to the clay giving way beneath
their feet But there was soft sand to tumble into and they reached the
beach safe though in a dishevelled scratched and thoroughly smeared
condition Then Helen sat down and covered her face with her hands
Her rescuer gazed triumphantly up at the distant rim of broken sod and
grinned

There by George he exclaimed We did it didnt we Say that was
fun

She removed her hands and looked at him

WHAT did you say it was she faltered

I said it was fun It was great Like something out of a book eh

She began to laugh hysterically He turned to her in indignant surprise
What are you laughing at he demanded

Ohoh dont please Just let me laugh If I dont laugh I shall cry
and I dont want to do that Just dont talk to me for a few minutes
thats all

When the few minutes were over she rose to her feet

Now we must get back to the pavilion I suppose she said My but
we are sights though Do lets see if we cant make ourselves a little
more presentable

She did her best to wipe off the thickest of the clay smears with her
handkerchief but the experiment was rather a failure As they started
to walk back along the beach she suddenly turned to him and said

I havent told you howhow much obliged I am forfor what you did If
you hadnt come I dont know what would have happened to me

Oh thats all right he answered lightly He was reveling in the
dramatic qualities of the situation She did not speak again for some
time and he too walked on in silence enjoying his day dream Suddenly
he became aware that she was looking at him steadily and with an odd
expression on her face

What is it he asked Why do you look at me that way

Her answer was as usual direct and frank

I was thinking about you she said I was thinking that I must have
been mistaken partly mistaken at least

Mistaken About me do you mean

Yes I had made up my mind that you werewell one sort of fellow and
now I see that you are an entirely different sort That is youve shown
that you can be different

What on earth do you mean by that

Why I meanI meanOh Im sure I had better not say it You wont
like it and will think I had better mind my own affairswhich I should
do of course

Go on say it

She looked at him again evidently deliberating whether or not to speak
her thought Then she said

Well I will say it Not that it is really my business but because in
a way it is begging your pardon and I ought to do that You see I had
begun to believe that you werethat you werewell that you were not
veryvery active you know

Active Say look here Helen What

Oh I dont wonder you dont understand I mean that you were
ratherrather fond of not doing muchofof

Eh Not doing much That I was lazy do you mean

Why not exactly lazy perhaps butbutOh how CAN I say just what
I mean I mean that you were always saying that you didnt like the work
in your grandfathers office

Which I dont

And that some day you were going to do something else

Which I am

Write or act or do something

Yes and thats true too

But you dont you know You dont do anything Youve been talking
that way ever since I knew you calling this a onehorse town and saying
how you hated it and that you werent going to waste your life here
and all that but you keep staying here and doing just the same things
The last long talk we had together you told me you knew you could write
poems and plays and all sorts of things you just felt that you could
You were going to begin right away You said that some months ago and
you havent done any writing at all Now have you

Noo No but that doesnt mean I shant by and by

But you didnt begin as you said you would That was last spring more
than a year ago and I dont believe you have tried to write a single
poem Have you

He was beginning to be ruffled It was quite unusual for any one most
of all for a girl to talk to him in this way

I dont know that I have he said loftily And anyway I dont see
that it isis

My business whether you have or not I know it isnt Im sorry I
spoke But you see IOh well never mind And I do want you to know
how much I appreciate your helping me as you did just now I dont know
how to thank you for that

But thanks were not exactly what he wanted at that moment

Go ahead and say the rest he ordered after a short pause Youve
said so much that you had better finish it seems to me Im lazy you
think What else am I

Youre brave awfully brave and you are so strong and quickyes
andandmasterful I think that is the right word You ordered me
about as if I were a little girl I didnt want to keep still as you
told me to I wanted to scream And I wanted to faint too but you
wouldnt let me I had never seen you that way before I didnt know you
could be like that That is what surprises me so That is why I said you
were so different

Here was balm for wounded pride Alberts chin lifted Oh that was
nothing he said Whatever had to be done must be done right off I
could see that You couldnt hang on where you were very long

She shuddered No she replied I could not But _I_ couldnt think
WHAT to do and you could Yes and did it and made me do it

The chin lifted still more and the Speranza chest began to expand
Helens next remark was in the natures of a reducer for the said
expansion

If you could be so prompt and strong andand energetic then she
said I cant help wondering why you arent like that all the time I
had begun to think you were justjust

Lazy eh he suggested

Whywhy noo but careless and indifferent and with not much
ambition certainly You had talked so much about writing and yet you
never tried to write anything thatthat

That you thought I was all bluff Thanks Any more compliments

She turned on him impulsively Oh dont she exclaimed Please
dont I know what I am saying sounds perfectly horrid and especially
now when you have just saved me from being badly hurt if not killed
But dont you see thatthat I am saying it because I am interested in
you and sure you COULD do so much if you only would If you would only
try

This speech was a compound of sweet and bitter Albert
characteristically selected the sweet

Helen he asked in his most confidential tone would you like to
have me try and write something Say would you

Of course I would Oh will you

Well if YOU asked me I might For your sake you know

She stopped and stamped her foot impatiently

Oh DONT be silly she exclaimed I dont want you to do it for
my sake I want you to do it for your own sake Yes and for your
grandfathers sake

My grandfathers sake Great Scott why do you drag him in HE doesnt
want me to write poetry

He wants you to do something to succeed I know that

He wants me to stay here and help Labe Keeler and Issy Price He wants
me to spend all my life in that office of his thats what HE wants
Now hold on Helen Im not saying anything against the old fellow He
doesnt like me I know but

You DONT know He does like you Or he wants to like you very much
indeed He would like to have you carry on the Snow Companys business
after he has gone but if you cantor wontdo that I know he would
be very happy to see you succeed at anythinganything

Albert laughed scornfully Even at writing poetry he asked

Why yes at writing although of course he doesnt know a thing about
it and cant understand how any one can possibly earn a living that way
He has read or heard about poets and authors starving in garrets and he
thinks theyre all like that But if you could only show him and prove
to him that you could succeed by writing he would be prouder of you
than any one else would be I know it

He regarded her curiously You seem to know a lot about my
grandfather he observed

I do know something about him He and I have been friends ever since
I was a little girl and I like him very much indeed If he were my
grandfather I should be proud of him And I think you ought to be

She flashed the last sentence at him in a sudden heat of enthusiasm He
was surprised at her manner

Gee You ARE strong for the old chap arent you he said Well
admitting that he is all right just why should I be proud of him I AM
proud of my father of course he was somebody in the world

You mean he was somebody just because he was celebrated and lots of
people knew about him Celebrated people arent the only ones who do
worth while things If I were you I should be proud of Captain Zelotes
because he is what he has made himself Nobody helped him he did it
all He was a sea captain and a good one He has been a business man and
a good one even if the business isnt so very big Everybody here
in South Harnissyes and all up and down the Capeknows of him and
respects him My father says in all the years he has preached in his
church he has never heard a single person as much as hint that Captain
Snow wasnt absolutely honest absolutely brave and the same to
everybody rich or poor And all his life he has worked and worked hard
What HE has belongs to him he has earned it Thats why I should be
proud of him if he were my grandfather

Her enthusiasm had continued all through this long speech Albert
whistled

Whew he exclaimed Regular cheer for Zelotes fellows Onetwo
Grandfathers got one person to stand up for him Ill say that But why
this sudden outbreak about him anyhow It was me you were talking about
in the beginningthough I didnt notice any loud calls for cheers in
that direction he added

She ignored the last part of the speech I think you yourself made me
think of him she replied Sometimes you remind me of him Not often
but once in a while Just now when we were climbing down that awful
place you seemed almost exactly like him The way you knew just what to
do all the time and your not hesitating a minute and the way you took
command of the situation and with a sudden laugh bossed me around
every bit of that was like him and not like you at all Oh I dont
mean that she added hurriedly I mean it wasnt like you as you
usually are It was different

Humph Well I must saySee here Helen Kendall what is it you expect
me to do sail in and write two or three sonnets and a Come Into
the Garden Maud some time next week Youre terribly keen about
Grandfather but he has rather got the edge on me so far as age goes
Hes in the sixties and Im just about nineteen

When he was nineteen he was first mate of a ship

Yes so Ive heard him say Maybe firstmating is a little bit easier
than writing poetry

And maybe it isnt At any rate he didnt know whether it was easy or
not until he tried Oh THATS what I would like to see you doTRY
to do something You could do it too almost anything you tried I do
believe I am confident you could ButOh well as you said at the
beginning it isnt my business at all and Ive said ever and ever so
much more than I meant to Please forgive me if you can I think my
tumble and all the rest must have made me silly Im sorry Albert
There are the steps up to the pavilion See them

He was tramping on beside her his hands in his pockets He did not look
at the long flight of steps which had suddenly come into view around the
curve of the bluff When he did look up and speak it was in a different
tone some such tone as she had heard him use during her rescue

All right he said with decision Ill show you whether I can try
or not I know you think I wont but I will Im going up to my room
tonight and Im going to try to write something or other It may be the
rottenest poem that ever was ground out but Ill grind it if it kills
me

She was pleased that was plain but she shook her head

Not tonight Albert she said Tonight after the picnic is
Fathers reception at the church Of course youll come to that

Of course I wont Look here youve called me lazy and indifferent and
a hundred other pet names this afternoon Well this evening Ill make
you take some of em back Reception be hanged Im going to write
tonight

That evening both Mrs Snow and Rachel Ellis were much disturbed because
Albert pleading a headache begged off from attendance at the reception
to the Reverend Mr Kendall Either or both ladies would have been only
too willing to remain at home and nurse the sufferer through his attack
but he refused to permit the sacrifice on their part After they had
gone his headache disappeared and supplied with an abundance of paper
pens and ink he sat down at the table in his room to invoke the Muse
The invocation lasted until three A M At that hour with a genuine
headache but a sense of triumph which conquered pain Albert climbed
into bed Upon the table lay a poem a six stanza poem having these
words at its head


 TO MY LADYS SPRING HAT
 By A M Speranza


The following forenoon he posted that poem to the editor of The Cape Cod
Item And three weeks later it appeared in the pages of that journal
Of course there was no pecuniary recompense for its author and the fact
was indisputable that the Item was generally only too glad to publish
contributions which helped to fill its columns But nevertheless
Albert Speranza had written a poem and that poem had been published



CHAPTER VII


It was Rachel who first discovered To My Ladys Spring Hat in the Item
three weeks later She came rushing into the sitting room brandishing
the paper

My soul My soul My soul she cried

Olive sitting sewing by the window was naturally somewhat startled
Mercy on us Rachel she exclaimed What IS it

Look cried the housekeeper pointing to the contribution in the
Poets Corner as Queen Isabella may have pointed at the evidence of
her proteges discovery of a new world LOOK

Mrs Snow looked read the verses to herself and then aloud

Why I declare theyre real sort of pretty aint they she
exclaimed in astonished admiration

Pretty Theyre perfectly elegant And right here in the paper for all
hands to see Aint you PROUD of him Mrs Snow

Olive had been growing more and more proud of her handsome grandson ever
since his arrival She was prouder still now and said so Rachel nodded
triumphantly

Hell be a Robert Penfold afore he dies or I miss MY guess she
declared

She showed it to feminine acquaintances all over town and Olive when
callers came took pains to see that a copy of the Item folded with the
Poets Corner uppermost lay on the center table Customers dropping
in at the office occasionally mentioned the poem to its author

See you had a piece in the Item Al was their usual way of referring
to it Pretty cute piece twas too seemed to me Say that girl of
yours must have SOME spring bunnit Ho ho

Issachar deigned to express approval approval qualified with discerning
criticism of course but approval nevertheless

Pretty good piece Al he observed Pretty good Glad to see you done
so well Course you made one little mistake but twant a very big one
That part where you saidWhat was it now Whered I put that piece of
poetry Oh yes here tis Where you saiderer


 It floats upon her golden curls
 As froth upon the wave


Now of course nothina hat or nothin elseis goin to float on top
of a persons head Froth floatin thats all right you understand
but even if you took froth right out of the water and slapped it up onto
anybodys hair twouldnt FLOAT up there If youd said


 It SETS up onto her golden curls
 Same as froth sets on top of a wave


that would have been all right and true But there dont feel bad about
it Its only a little mistake same as anybodys liable to make Nine
persons out of ten wouldnt have noticed it Im extry particlar I
presume likely Im findin mistakes like that all the time

Labans comment was less critical perhaps but more reserved

Its pretty good Al he said Yeseryes sir its pretty good
It aint all new theres some of it thats been written before but I
rather guess that might have been said about Shakespeares poetry when
he fust commenced Its pretty good Al Yesyes yes It is so

Albert was inclined to resent the qualified strain in the bookkeepers
praise He was tempted to be sarcastic

Well he observed of course youve read so much real poetry that you
ought to know

Laban nodded slowly Ive read a good deal he said quietly Readin
is one of the few things I aint made a failure of in this life Umhm
One of the few Yes yesyes

He dipped his pen in the inkwell and carefully made an entry in the
ledger His assistant felt a sudden pang of compunction

I beg your pardon Mr Keeler he said That was pretty fresh of me
Im sorry

Laban looked up in mild surprise Sorry he repeated What for   
Oh thats all right Al thats all right Lord knows Im the last one
on earth whod ought to criticize anybody All I had in mind in sayin
what I did was towell to kind of keep you from bein too well
satisfied and not try harder on the next one It dont pay to be too
well satisfied    Years ago I can remember _I_ was pretty well
satisfiedwith myself and my work Sounds like a joke I know but
twas so    Well Ive had a nice long chance to get over it Umhm
Yesyes So I have so I have

Only Captain Zelotes at first said nothing about the poem He read it
his wife saw to that but his comment even to her was a noncommittal
grunt

But dont you think its real sort of pretty Zelotes she asked

The captain grunted again Why I guess likely tis if you say so
Mother I dont know much about such things

But everybody says it is

Want to know Well then twont make much difference whether I say it
or not

But aint you goin to say a word to Albert about it Zelotes

Humph I dont knows I know what to say

Why say you like it

Yees and if I do hell keep on writin more Thats exactly what I
dont want him to do Come now Mother be sensible This piece of his
may be good or it may not _I_ wouldnt undertake to say But this I do
know I dont want the boy to spend his time writin poetry slush for
that Poets Corner Letitia Makepeace did thatshe had a piece in
there about every weekand she died in the Taunton asylum

But Zelotes it wasnt her poetry got her into the asylum

Want it Well she was in the poorhouse afore that I dont know
whether twas her poetryin that got her in there but I know darned
well it didnt get her out

But aint you goin to say one word Twould encourage him so

Good Lord We dont want to encourage him do we If he was takin to
thievin you wouldnt encourage him in that would you

Thievin Zelotes Snow you dont mean to say you compare a poet to a
THIEF

The captain grinned Noo Mother he observed drily Sometimes a
thief can manage to earn a livin at his job But there there dont
feel bad Ill say somethin to Al longs you think I ought to

The something was not much and yet Captain Zelotes really meant it to
be kindly and to sound like praise But praising a thing of which you
have precious little understanding and with which you have absolutely no
sympathy is a hard job

See you had a piece in the Item this week Al observed the captain

Whyyes sir said Albert

Umhm I read it I dont know much about such things but they tell me
it is pretty good

Thank you sir

Eh Oh youre welcome

That was all Perhaps considering its source it was a good deal but
Albert was not of the age where such considerations are likely to be
made

Helens praise was warm and enthusiastic I knew you could do it if you
only would she declared And oh Im SO glad you did Now you must
keep on trying

That bit of advice was quite superfluous Young Speranza having sampled
the sublime intoxication of seeing himself in print was not ready to
sober off yet a while He continued to bombard the Item with verses
They were invariably accepted but when he sent to a New York magazine
a poem which he considered a gem the promptness with which it was
returned staggered his conceit and was in that respect a good thing for
him

However he kept on trying Helen would not have permitted him to
give up even if he had wished She was quite as much interested in his
literary aspirations as he was himself and her encouragement was a great
help to him After months of repeated trial and repeated rejection he
opened an envelope bearing the name of a fairly wellknown periodical to
find therein a kindly note stating that his poem Sea Spaces had been
accepted And a week later came a check for ten dollars That was a day
of days Incidentally it was the day of a trial balance in the office
and the assistant bookkeepers additions and multiplications contained
no less than four ghastly errors

The next afternoon there was an interview in the back office Captain
Zelotes and his grandson were the participants The subject discussed
was Business versus Poetry and there was a marked difference of
opinion Albert had proclaimed his triumph at home of course had
exhibited his check had been the recipient of hugs and praises from his
grandmother and had listened to paeans and hallelujahs from Mrs Ellis
When he hurried around to the parsonage after supper Helen had been
excited and delighted at the good news Albert had been patted on the
back quite as much as was good for a young man whose bump of selfesteem
was not inclined toward underdevelopment When he entered the private
office of Z Snow and Co in answer to his grandfathers summons he did
so lightheartedly triumphantly with selfapproval written large upon
him

But though he came like a conquering hero he was not received like one
Captain Zelotes sat at his desk the copy of the Boston morning paper
which he had been reading sticking out of the waste basket into which
it had been savagely jammed a half hour before The news had not been to
the captains liking These were the September days of 1914 the German
Kaiser was marching forward mit Gott through Belgium and it began to
look as if he could not be stopped short of Paris Consequently Captain
Zelotes his sympathies from the first with England and the Allies was
not happy in his newspaper reading

Albert entered head erect and eyes shining If Gertie Kendrick could
have seen him then she would have fallen down and worshiped His
grandfather looked at him in silence for a moment tapping his desk with
the stump of a pencil Albert too was silent he was already thinking
of another poem with which to dazzle the world and his head was among
the rosy clouds

Sit down Al said Captain Zelotes shortly

Albert reluctantly descended to earth and took the battered armchair
standing beside the desk The captain tapped with his pencil upon the
figurecovered sheet of paper before him Then he said

Al youve been here three years come next December aint you

Whyyes sir I believe I have

Umhm you have And for the heft of that time youve been in this
office

Yes sir

Yes And Labe Keeler and I have been doin our best to make a business
man out of you You understand we have dont you

Albert looked puzzled and a little uneasy Into his roseate dreams was
just beginning to filter the idea that his grandfathers tone and manner
were peculiar

Why yes sir of course I understand it he replied

Well I asked you because I wasnt quite sure whether you did or not
Can you guess what this is Ive got on my desk here

He tapped the figurecovered sheet of paper once more Before Albert
could speak the captain answered his own question

Ill tell you what it is he went on Its one of the latest samples
of your smartness as a business man I presume likely you know that
Laban worked here in this office until three oclock this mornin
didnt you

Albert did not know it Mr Keeler had told him nothing of the sort

Why no he replied Did he What for

Yees he did And what for Why just to find out what was the matter
with his trial balance thats all When one of Labes trial balances
starts out for snug harbor and ends up on a reef with six foot of water
in her hold naturally Labe wants to get her afloat and pumped dry as
quick as possible He aint used to it for one thing and it makes him
nervous

Alberts uneasiness grew When his grandfathers speech became sarcastic
and nautical the young man had usually found that there was trouble
coming for somebody

IIm sorry Laban had to stay so late he stammered I should have
been glad to stay and help him but he didnt ask me

Noo Well it may possibly be that he callated he was carryin about
all your help that the craft would stand as twas Any more might sink
her See here young feller Captain Zelotes dropped his quiet sarcasm
and spoke sharp and brisk See here he said do you realize that
this sheet of paper Ive got here is what stands for a days work done
by you yesterday And on this sheet there was no less than four silly
mistakes that a child ten years old hadnt ought to make that an
ablebodied idiot hadnt ought to make But YOU made em and they kept
Labe Keeler here till three oclock this mornin Now what have you got
to say for yourself

As a matter of fact Albert had very little to say except that he was
sorry and that his grandfather evidently did not consider worth the
saying He waved the protestation aside

Sorry he repeated impatiently Of course youre sorry though even
at that I aint sure youre sorry enough Labe was sorry too I dont
doubt when his bedtime went by and he kept runnin afoul of one of your
mistakes after another Im sorry darned sorry to find out that
you can make such blunders after three years on board here under such
teachin as youve had But bein sorry dont help any to speak of Any
fool can be sorry for his foolishness but if thats all it dont help
a whole lot Is bein sorry the best excuse youve got to offer What
made you make the mistakes in the first place

Alberts face was darkly red under the lash of his grandfathers tongue
Captain Zelotes and he had had disagreements and verbal encounters
before but never since they had been together had the captain spoken
like this And the young fellow was no longer seventeen he was twenty
The flush began to fade from his cheeks and the pallor which meant the
rise of the Speranza temper took its place

What made you make such fool blunders repeated the captain You knew
better didnt you

Yes sullenly I suppose I did

You know mighty well you did And as nigh as I can larn from what I
got out of Labanwhich wasnt much I had to pump it out of him word
by wordthis aint the first set of mistakes youve made You make em
right along If it wasnt for him helpin you out and coverin up your
mistakes this firm would be in hot water with its customers twothirds
of the time and the books would be fustrate as a puzzle somethin to
use for a guessin match but plaguey little good as straight accounts
of a goin concern Now what makes you act this way Eh What makes
you

Oh I dont know See here Grandfather

Hold on a minute You dont know eh Well I know It aint because
you aint smart enough to keep a set of books and keep em well I dont
expect you to be a Labe Keeler there aint many bookkeepers like him on
this earth But I do know youre smart enough to keep my books and keep
em as theyd ought to be if you want to keep em The trouble with
you is that you dont want to Youve got too much of your
goodfornothin Captain Lote pulled up short cleared his throat
and went on Youve got too much poet in you he declared thats
whats the matter

Albert leaned forward That wasnt what you were going to say he said
quickly You were going to say that I had too much of my father in me

It was the captains turn to redden Eh he stammered Why IIHow
do you know what I was goin to say

Because I do You say it all the time Or if you dont say it you
look it There is hardly a day that I dont catch you looking at me as
if you were expecting me to commit murder or do some outrageous thing
or other And I know too that it is all because Im my fathers son
Well thats all right feel that way about me if you want to I cant
help it

Here here Al Hold on Dont

I wont hold on And I tell you this I hate this work here You say
I dont want to keep books Well I dont Im sorry I made the errors
yesterday and put Keeler to so much trouble but Ill probably make
more No with a sudden outburst of determination I wont make
any more I wont because Im not going to keep books any more Im
through

Captain Zelotes leaned back in his chair

Youre what he asked slowly

Im through Ill never work in this office another day Im through

The captains brows drew together as he stared steadily at his grandson
He slowly tugged at his beard

Humph he grunted after a moment So youre through eh Goin to
quit and go somewheres else you mean

Yes

Umhm I see Where are you goin to go

I dont know But Im not going to make a fool of myself at this job
any longer I cant keep books and I wont keep them I hate business
Im no good at it And I wont stay here

I see I see Well if you wont keep on in business what will you do
for a livin Write poetry

Perhaps

Umm Be kind of slim livin wont it Youve been writin poetry
for about a year and a half as I recollect and so far youve made ten
dollars

Thats all right If I dont make it I may starve as you are always
saying that writers do But starve or not I shant ask YOU to take
care of me

Ive taken care of you for three years or so

Yes But you did it becausebecauseWell I dont know why you did
exactly but you wont have to do it any longer Im through

The captain still stared steadily and what he saw in the dark eyes
which flashed defiance back at him seemed to trouble him a little His
tugs at his beard became more strenuous

Humph he muttered Humph    Well Al of course I cant make you
stay by main force Perhaps I couldyou aint of age yetbut I shant
And you want to quit the ship altogether do you

If you mean this officeyes I do

I see I see Want to quit South Harniss and your grandmotherand
Racheland Labeand Helenand all the rest of em

Not particularly But I shall have to of course

Yes    Umhm    Yes Have you thought how your grandmothers
liable to feel when she hears you are goin to clear out and leave her

Albert had not thought in that way but he did now His tone was a
trifle less combative as he answered

Shell be sorry at first I suppose he said but shell get over
it

Umhm Maybe she will You can get over most anything in timeMOST
anything Well and how about me How do you think Ill feel

Alberts chin lifted You he exclaimed Why youll be mighty glad
of it

Captain Zelotes picked up the pencil stump and twirled it in his
fingers Shall I he asked You think I will do you

Of course you will You dont like me and never did

So Ive heard you say Well boy dont you callate I like you at
least as much as you like me

No What do you mean I like you well enough That is I should if
you gave me half a chance But you dont do it You hate me because my
father

The captain interrupted His big palm struck the desk

DONT say that again he commanded Look here if I hated you do you
suppose Id be talkin to you like this If I hated you do you callate
Id argue when you gave me notice Not by a jugful No man ever came to
me and said he was goin to quit and had me beg him to stay If we was
at sea he stayed until we made port then he WENT and he didnt hang
around waitin for a boat to take him ashore neither I dont hate you
son Id ask nothin better than a chance to like you but you wont
give it to me

Alberts eyes and mouth opened

_I_ wont give YOU a chance he repeated

Sartin DO you give me one I ask you to keep these books of mine
You could keep em A Number One Youre smart enough to do it But you
wont You let em go to thunder and waste your time makin up fool
poetry and such stuff

But I like writing and I dont like keeping books

Keepin books is a part of larnin the business and business is the
way youre goin to get your livin by and by

No it isnt I am going to be a writer

Now DONT say that silly thing again I dont want to hear it

I shall say it because it is true

Look here boy When I tell you or anybody else in this office to do
or not to do a thing I expect em to obey orders And I tell you not
to talk any more of that foolishness about bein a writer Dyou
understand

Yes of course I understand

All right then that much is settled    Here Where are you
goin

Albert had turned and was on his way out of the office He stopped and
answered over his shoulder Im going home he said

Goin HOME Why you came from home not more than an hour and a half
ago What are you goin there again now for

To pack up my things

To pack up your things To pack upHumph So you really mean it
Youre really goin to quit me like this And your grandma too

The young man felt a sudden pang of compunction a twinge of conscience

Grandfather he said Im sorry I

But the change in his attitude and tone came too late Captain Lotes
temper was boiling now contradiction was its worst provocative

Goin to quit he sneered Goin to quit because you dont like to
work All right quit then Go ahead Ive done all I can to make a man
of you Go to the devil in your own way

Grandfather I

Go ahead _I_ cant stop you Its in your breed I callate

That was sufficient Albert strode out of the private office head
erect Captain Zelotes rose and slammed the door after his departing
grandson

At ten that evening Albert was in his room sitting in a chair by the
window gloomily looking out The packing most of it had been done He
had not as he told his grandfather he intended doing left the office
immediately and come straight home to pack As he emerged from the inner
office after the stormy interview with the captain he found Laban Keeler
hard at work upon the books The sight of the little man so patiently
and cheerfully pegging away brought another twinge of conscience to
the assistant bookkeeper Laban had been such a brick in all their
relationships It must have been a sore trial to his particular
businesslike soul those errors in the trial balance Yet he had not
found fault nor complained Captain Zelotes himself had said that every
item concerning his grandsons mistakes and blunders had been dragged
from Mr Keeler much against the latters will Somehow Albert could not
bear to go off and leave him at once He would stay and finish his days
work for Labe Keelers sake

So stay he did and when Captain Zelotes later came out of his private
office and found him there neither of them spoke At home during
supper nothing was said concerning the quarrel of the afternoon Yet
Albert was as determined to leave as ever and the Captain judging by
the expression of his face was just as determined to do nothing more to
prevent him After supper the young man went to his room and began the
packing His grandfather went out an unusual proceeding for him saying
that he guessed he would go down street for a spell

Now Albert as he sat there by the window was gloomy enough The wind
howling and wailing about the gables of the old house was not an aid
to cheerfulness and he needed every aid He had sworn to go away he was
going awaybut where should he go He had a little money put by not
much but a little which he had been saving for quite another purpose
This would take him a little way would pay his bills for a short time
but after thatWell after that he could earn more With the optimism
of youth and the serene selfconfidence which was natural to him he was
sure of succeeding sooner or later It was not the dread of failure and
privation which troubled him The weight which was pressing upon his
spirit was not the fear of what might happen to him

There was a rap upon the door Then a voice the housekeepers voice
whispered through the crack

Its me Al whispered Mrs Ellis You aint in bed yet are you Id
like to talk with you a minute or two if I might

He was not anxious to talk to her or anyone else just then but he told
her to come in She entered on tiptoe with the mysterious air of a
conspirator and shut the door carefully after her

May I set down just a minute she asked I can generally talk better
settin

He pulled forward the ancient rocker with the rush seat The
crossstitch tidy on the back was his mothers handiwork she had made
it when she was fifteen Rachel sat down in the rocker

Al she began still in the same mysterious whisper I know all about
it

He looked at her All about what he asked

About the trouble you and Capn Lote had this afternoon I know youre
plannin to leave us all and go away somewheres and that he told you to
go and all that I know what youve been doin up here tonight Furs
that goes she added with a little catch in her breath and a wave of
her hand toward the open trunk and suitcase upon the floor I wouldnt
need to know I could SEE

Albert was surprised and confused He had supposed the whole affair to
be so far a secret between himself and his grandfather

You know he stammered YouHow did you know

Laban told me Labe came hurryin over here just after supper and
told me the whole thing Hes awful upset about it Laban is He thinks
almost as much of you as he does of Capn Lote oror me with an
apologetic little smile

Albert was astonished and troubled How did Labe know about it he
demanded

He heard it all He couldnt help hearin

But he couldnt have heard The door to the private office was shut

Yes but the window at the topthe transom one you knowwas wide
open You and your grandpa never thought of that I guess and Laban
couldnt hop up off his stool and shut it without givin it away that
hed been hearin So he had to just set and listen and I know how he
hated doin that Laban Keeler aint the listenin kind One thing about
it all is a mercy she added fervently Its the Lords own mercy
that that Issy Price wasnt where HE could hear it too If Issy heard
it you might as well paint it up on the townhall fence all creation
and his wife wouldnt larn it any sooner

Albert drew a long breath Well he said after a moment Im sorry
Labe heard but I dont suppose it makes much difference Everyone will
know all about it in a day or two    Im going

Rachel leaned forward

No you aint Al she said

Im not Indeed I am Why what do you mean

I mean just what I say You aint goin Youre goin to stay right
here At least I hope you are and I THINK you are    Oh I know
she added quickly what you are goin to say Youre goin to tell me
that your grandpa is down on you on account of your father and that you
dont like bookkeepin and that you want to write poetry andand such
Youll say all that and maybe its all true but whether tis or not
aint the point at all just now The real point is that youre Janie
Snows son and your grandpas Capn Lote Snow and your grandmas Olive
Snow and there aint goin to be another smashup in this family if I
can help it Ive been through one and ones enough Albert didnt you
promise me that Sunday forenoon three years ago when I came into the
settinroom and we got talkin about books and Robert Penfold and
everythingdidnt you promise me then that when things between you and
your grandpa got kind ofof snarled up and full of knots youd come
to me with em and wed see if we couldnt straighten em out together
Didnt you promise me that Albert

Albert remembered the conversation to which she referred As he
remembered it however he had not made any definite promise

You asked me to talk them over with you Rachel he admitted I think
thats about as far as it went

Well maybe so but now I ask you again Will you talk this over with
me Albert Will you tell me every bit all about it for my sake And
for your grandmas sake    Yes moren that for your mothers sake
Albert she was pretty nigh like my own sister Jane Snow was Different
as night from day of course she was pretty and educated and all that
and I was just the same then as I am now but we did think a lot of each
other Albert Tell me the whole story wont you please Just what
Capn Lote said and what you said and what you plan to doand all
Please Albert

There were tears in her eyes He had always liked her but it was
a liking with a trace of condescension in it She was peculiar her
sympathetic attacks were funny and she and Laban together were an odd
pair Now he saw her in a new light and he felt a sudden rush of real
affection for her And with this feeling and inspired also by his
loneliness came the impulse to comply with her request to tell her all
his troubles

He began slowly at first but as he went on the words came quicker She
listened eagerly nodding occasionally but saying nothing When he had
finished she nodded again

I see she said Twas almost what Laban said and about what he and
I expected Well Albert I aint goin to be the one to blame you not
very much anyhow I dont see as you are to blame you cant help the
way youre made But your grandfather cant help bein made his way
either He cant see with your spectacles and you cant see with his

He stirred rebelliously Then we had better go our own ways I should
say he muttered

No you hadnt Thats just what you mustnt do not now anyhow As
I said before theres been enough of all hands goin their own ways in
this family and look what came of it

But what do you expect me to do I will not give up every plan Ive
made and my chance in the world just because he is too stubborn and
cranky to understand them I will NOT do it

I dont want you to But I dont want you to upset the whole kettle
just because the steam has scalded your fingers I dont want you to
go off and leave your grandma to break her heart a second time and your
grandpa to give up all his plans and hopes that hes been makin about
you

Plans about me He making plans about me What sort of plans

All sorts Oh he dont say much about em of course that aint his
way But from things hes let drop I know he has hoped to take you in
with him as a partner one of these days and to leave you the business
after hes gone

Nonsense Rachel

No it aint nonsense Its the one big dream of Capn Lotes life
That Z Snow and Co business is his pet child as you might say He
built it up he and Labe together and when he figgered to take you
aboard with him twas SOME chance for you cordin to his lookout Now
you cant hardly blame him for bein disappointed when you chuck that
chance away and take to writin poetry pieces can you

Butbutwhy confound it Rachel you dont understand

Yes I do but your grandpa dont And you dont understand him   
Oh Albert DONT be as stubborn as he is as your mother wasthe Lord
and she forgive me for sayin it She was partly right about marryin
your pa and Capn Lote was partly right too If they had met half way
and put the two partlys together the whole thing might have been right
in the end As twas twas all wrong Dont dont DONT Albert be
as stubborn as that For their sakes Alyes and for my sake for Im
one of your family too or seems as if I wasdont

She hastily wiped her eyes with her apron He too was greatly moved

Dont cry Rachel he muttered hurriedly Please dont    I
didnt know you felt this way I didnt know anybody did I dont want
to make trouble in the familyany more trouble Grandmother has been
awfully good to me so too has Grandfather I suppose in his way
Butoh what am I going to do I cant stay in that office all my life
Im not good at business I dont like it I cant give up

No no course you mustnt I dont want you to give up

Then what do you want me to do

I want you to go to your grandpa and talk to him once more Not givin
up your plans altogether but not forcin him to give up his either not
right away Tell him you realize he wants you to go on with Z Snow and
Company and that you willfor a while

But

For a while I said three or four years say You wont be so dreadful
old then not exactly what youd call a Methusalem Tell him youll
do that and on his side he must let you write as much as you please
provided you dont let the writin interfere with the Z Snow and Co
work Then at the end of the three or four years if you still feel
the same as you do now you can tackle your poetry for keeps and he and
youll still be friends Tell him that Albert and see what he says
   Will you

Albert took some moments to consider At length he said If I did I
doubt if he would listen

Oh yes he would Hed more than listen Im pretty sartin I think
hed agree

You do

Yes I do You see with a smile while Ive been talkin to you
theres been somebody else talkin to him    There there dont you
ask any questions I promised not to tell anybody and if I aint exactly
broke that promise Ive sprained its ankle Im afraid Good night
Albert and thank you ever and ever so much for listenin so long
without once tellin me to mind my own business

Good night Rachel    And thank you for taking so much interest in
my affairs Youre an awfully good friend I can see that

Dontdont talk that way And you WILL have that talk with your
grandpa

Yes I will

Oh Im SO glad There Good night I come pretty nigh kissin you
then and for a woman thats been engaged to be married for upwards of
eighteen years thats a nice way to act aint it Good night good
night

She hurried out of the room Albert sat down again in his chair by the
window He had promised to go to his grandfather and talk to him As he
sat there thinking of the coming interview he realized more and more
that the keeping of that promise was likely to be no easy matter He
must begin the talk he must break the iceand how should he break
it Timid and roundabout approaches would be of little use unless his
grandfathers state of mind had changed remarkably since their
parting in the Z Snow and Co office they and their motive would be
misunderstood No the only way to break the ice was to break it to
plunge immediately into the deepest part of the subject It promised to
be a chilly plunge He shivered at the prospect

A half hour later he heard the door of the hall open and shut and knew
that Captain Zelotes had returned Rising he descended the stairs
He descended slowly Just as he reached the foot of the narrow flight
Captain Zelotes entered the hall from the diningroom and turned toward
him Both were surprised at the meeting Albert spoke first

Good evening Grandfather he stammered II was just coming down to
see you Were you going to bed

Captain Lote shook his head Noo he said slowly not exactly

Do you mind waiting a minute I have a few thingsI have something to
say to you andand I guess I shall sleep better if I say it tonight
II wont keep you long

The captain regarded him intently for an instant then he turned and led
the way to the diningroom

Go ahead he ordered laconically Albert squared his shoulders
preparatory to the plunge

Grandfather he began first of all I want to tell you I am sorry
forfor some of the things I said this afternoon

He had rehearsed this opening speech over and over again but in spite
of the rehearsals it was dreadfully hard to make If his grandfather
had helped him even a little it might have been easier but the captain
merely stood there expressionless saying nothing waiting for him to
continue

Albert swallowed clenched his fists and took a new start

Of course he began I am sorry for the mistakes I made in my
bookkeeping but that I have told you before Nownow I want to say
I am sorry for being sowell so pigheaded about the rest of it I
realize that you have been mighty kind to me and that I owe you about
everything that Ive got in this world

He paused again It had seemed to him that Captain Zelotes was about to
speak However he did not so the young man stumbled on

Andand I realize too he said that you have I guess been trying
to give me a real start in business the start you think I ought to
have

The captain nodded slowly That was my idea in startin you he said

Yesand fact that I havent done more with the chance is because Im
made that way I guess But I do want toyes and I MEAN to try to
succeed at writing poetry or stories or plays or something I like
that and I mean to give it a trial And soand so you see Ive been
thinking our talk over and Ive concluded that perhaps you may be right
maybe Im not old enough to know what I really am fitted for and yet
perhaps _I_ may be partly right too IIve been thinking that perhaps
some sort ofof

Of what

Well of halfway arrangementsome sort ofof compromise you know
might be arranged I might agree to stay in the office and do my very
best with bookkeeping and business forwell say three years or so
During that time I should be trying to write of course but I would
only do that sort of writing evenings or on Saturdays and holidays It
shouldnt interfere with your work nor be done in the time you pay me
for And at the end of the three or four years

He paused again This time the pause was longer than ever Captain
Lote broke the silence His big right hand had wandered upward and was
tugging at his beard

Well    And then he asked

Why thenififWell then we could see If business seemed to be
where I was most likely to succeed wed call it settled and I would stay
with Z Snow and Co If poetrymaking ororliterature seemed more
likely to be the job I was fitted for that would be the job Id take
Youyou see dont you Grandfather

The captains beardpulling continued He was no longer looking his
grandson straight in the eye His gaze was fixed upon the braided mat at
his feet and he answered without looking up

Yees he drawled I callate I see Well was that all you had to
say

Noo not quite II wanted to say that which ever way it turned
out II hoped weyou and I you knowwould agree to beto be
goodnatured about it andand friends just the same IIWell there
Thats all I guess I havent put it very well Im afraid butbut
what do you think about it Grandfather

And now Captain Zelotes did look up The old twinkle was in his eye His
first remark was a question and that question was rather surprising

Al he asked Al whos been talkin to you

The blood rushed to his grandsons face Talking to me he stammered
Whywhy what do you mean

I mean just that You didnt think out this scheme all by yourself
Somebodys been talkin to you and puttin you up to it Havent they

Whywhy Grandfather I

Havent they

WhyWell yes someone has been talking to me but the whole idea
isnt theirs I WAS sorry for speaking to you as I did and sorry to
think of leaving you and grandmother II was sitting up there in my
room and feeling blue and mean enough andand

And then Rachel came aboard and gave you your sailin orders eh

Albert gasped For heavens sake how did you know that he demanded
SheWhy she must have told you after all But she said

Hold on boy hold on Captain Lote chuckled quietly No he said
Rachel didnt tell me I guessed she was the one And it didnt take
a Solomon in all his glory to guess it neither Labe Keelers been
talkin to ME and when you come down here and began proposin the same
scheme that I was just about headin up to your room with to propose
to you thenwell then the average wholewitted person wouldnt need
moren one guess It couldnt be Labe cause hed been whisperin in MY
ear so it must have been the other partner in the firm Thats all the
miracle there is to it

Alberts brain struggled with the situation I see he said after a
moment She hinted that someone had been talking to you along the same
line Yes and she was so sure you would agree I might have known it
was Laban

Umhm so you might    Well there have been times when if a man
had talked to me as Labe did tonight Id have knocked him down or told
him to go toumwell the tropicstold him to mind his own business
at least But Labe is Labe and besides MY conscience was plaguin me a
little mite maybe    maybe

The young man shook his head They must have talked it over those two
and agreed that one should talk to you and the other to me By George I
wonder they had the nerve It wasnt their business really

Not a darn bit

Yetyet IIm awfully glad she said it to me II needed it I
guess

Maybe you did son    Andhumphwell maybe I needed it too
   Yes I know thats considerble for me to say he added dryly

Albert was still thinking of Laban and Rachel

Theyre queer people he mused When I first met them I thought
they were about the funniest pair I ever saw Butbut now I cant
help liking them andandSay Grandfather they must think a lot of
yourof our family

Callate they do son    Well boy weve had our sermon you and
me what shall we do Willin to sign for the five years trial cruise if
I will are you

Albert couldnt help smiling It was three years Rachel proposed not
five he said

Was eh Suppose we split the difference and make it four Willin to
try that

Yes sir

Agreement bein that you shall stick close to Z Snow and Co durin
work hours and write as much poetry as you darned please other times
neither side to interfere with those arrangements That right

Yes sir

Good Shall we shake hands on it

They shook solemnly Captain Lote was the first to speak after
ratification of the contract

There now I callate Ill go aloft and turn in he observed Then he
added with a little hesitation Say Al maybe wed better not trouble
your grandma about all this fool businessthe row this afternoon
and all Twould only worry her and he paused looked embarrassed
cleared his throat and said to tell you the truth Im kind of
ashamed of my partererthat is some of it

His grandson was very much astonished It was not often that Captain
Zelotes Snow admitted having been in the wrong He blurted out the
question he had been dying to ask

Grandfather he queried had youdid you really mean what you
said about starting to come to my room andand propose this scheme of
oursI mean of Rachels and Labesto me

Eh    Yeesyes I was on my way up there when I met you just

The captains heavy hand descended upon his shoulder

new arrangement of ours We wont have fathers ororelopementsor
pastanddonewith disappintments in it This new dealthis four year
trial vyage of ourswill be just for Albert Speranza and Zelotes Snow
and no others need apply    Eh    Well good night Al



CHAPTER VIII


So the game under the new deal began At first it was much easier than
the old And as a matter of fact it was never as hard as before The
heart to heart talk between Captain Zelotes and his grandson had given
each a glimpse of the others inner self a look from the others
point of view and thereafter it was easier to make allowances But the
necessity for the making of those allowances was still there and would
continue to be there At first Albert made almost no mistakes in his
bookkeeping was almost painfully careful Then the carefulness relaxed
as it was bound to do and some mistakes occurred Captain Lote
found little fault but at times he could not help showing some
disappointment Then his grandson would set his teeth and buckle down to
painstaking effort again He was resolved to live up to the very letter
of the agreement

In his spare time he continued to write and occasionally he sold
something Whenever he did so there was great rejoicing among the
feminine members of the Snow household his grandmother and Rachel Ellis
were enraptured It was amusing to see Captain Zelotes attempt to join
the chorus He evidently felt that he ought to praise or at least that
praise was expected from him but it was also evident that he did not
approve of what he was praising

Your grandma says you got rid of another one of your poetry pieces
Al he would say Pay you for it did they

Not yet but they will I suppose

I see I see How much think likely

Oh I dont know Ten dollars perhaps

Umhm    I see    Well thats pretty good considerin I
suppose    We did firstrate on that Hyannis schoolhouse contract
didnt we Nighs I can figger it we cleared over fourteen hundred and
eighty dollars on that

He invariably followed any reference to the profit from the sale of
verses by the casual mention of a much larger sum derived from the sale
of lumber or hardware This was so noticeable that Laban Keeler was
impelled to speak of it

The old man dont want you to forget that you can get more for hard
pine than you can for soft sonnets sellin em both by the foot
observed Labe peering over his spectacles More money in shingles
than there is in jingles he callates    Um    Yes yes   
Considerble more considerble

Albert smiled but it astonished him to find that Mr Keeler knew what a
sonnet was The little bookkeeper occasionally surprised him by breaking
out unexpectedly in that way

From the indiscriminate praise at home or the reluctant praise of his
grandfather he found relief when he discussed his verses with Helen
Kendall Her praise was not indiscriminate in fact sometimes she
did not praise at all but expressed disapproval They had some
disagreements marked disagreements but it did not affect their
friendship Albert was a trifle surprised to find that it did not

So as the months passed he ground away at the books of Z Snow and
Company during office hours and at the poetry mill between times The
seeing of his name in print was no longer a novelty and he poetized not
quite as steadily Occasionally he attempted prose but the two or three
short stories of his composition failed to sell Helen however urged
him to try again and keep trying I know you can write a good story and
some day you are going to she said

His first real literary success that which temporarily lifted him into
the outer circle of the limelight of fame was a poem written the day
following that upon which came the news of the sinking of the Lusitania
Captain Zelotes came back from the postoffice that morning a crumpled
newspaper in his hand and upon his face the look which mutinous
foremast hands had seen there just before the mutiny ended Laban Keeler
was the first to notice the look For the land sakes Capn whats
gone wrong he asked The captain flung the paper upon the desk Read
that he grunted Labe slowly spread open the paper the big black
headlines shrieked the crime aloud

Good God Almighty exclaimed the little bookkeeper Captain Zelotes
snorted He didnt have anything to do with it he declared The
bunch that pulled that off was handled from the other end of the line
And I wish to thunder I was young enough to help send em back there
he added savagely

That evening Albert wrote his poem The next day he sent it to a Boston
paper It was published the following morning spread across two columns
on the front page and before the month was over had been copied widely
over the country Within the fortnight its author received his first
request a bona fida request for verse from a magazine Even Captain
Lotes praise of the Lusitania poem was wholehearted and ungrudging

That summer was a busy one in South Harniss There was the usual amount
of summer gaiety but in addition there were the gatherings of the
various committees for war relief work Helen belonged to many of
these committees There were dances and theatrical performances for the
financial benefit of the various causes and here Albert shone But
he did not shine alone Helen Kendall was very popular at the social
gatherings popular not only with the permanent residents but with the
summer youth as well Albert noticed this but he did not notice it so
particularly until Issy Price called his attention to it

Say Al observed Issy one afternoon in late August of that year
how do YOU like that Raymond young feller

Albert looked up absently from the page of the daybook

Eh What he asked

I say how do YOU like that Eddie Raymond the DownattheNeck one

Down at the neck Theres nothing the matter with his neck that I know
of

Who said there was He LIVES down to the Neck dont he I mean that
young Raymond son of the New York bank man the ones thats had the
Cahoon house all summer How do you like him

Alberts attention was still divided between the daybook and Mr Price
Oh I guess hes all right he answered carelessly I dont know him
very well Dont bother me Issy Im busy

Issachar chuckled Hes busy too he observed He he he Hes
busy trottin after Helen Kendall Dont seem to have time for much else
these days Noticed that aint you Al He he

Albert had not noticed it His attention left the daybook altogether
Issachar chuckled again

Noticed it aint you Al he repeated If you aint youre the only
one Everybodys callatin youll be cut out if you aint careful
Folks used to figger you was Helens steady compny but it dont look
as much so as it did He he Thats why I asked you how you liked the
Raymond one Eh How do you Al Helen SHE seems to like him fustrate
He he he

Albert was conscious of a peculiar feeling partly of irritation at
Issachar partly something else Mr Price crowed delightedly

Hi he chortled Why Al your face is gettin all redded up Haw
haw Blushin aint you Al Haw haw haw Blushin by crimustee

Albert laid down his pen He had learned by experience that in Issys
case the maxim of the best defensive being a strong offensive was
absolutely true He looked with concern about the office

Theres a window open somewhere isnt there Is he inquired
Theres a dreadful draught anyhow

Eh Draught I dont feel no draught Course the windows open its
generally open in summer time aint it Haw haw

There it is again WhereOh _I_ see Its your mouth thats open
Issy That explains the draught of course Yes yes of course

Eh My mouth Never you mind my mouth What youve got to think about
is that Eddie Raymond Yes siree Haw haw

Issy what makes you make that noise

What noise

That awful cawing If youre trying to make me believe youre a crow
youre wasting your time

Say look here Al Speranzy be you crazy

Noo IM not But in your casewell Ill leave it to any fairminded
person

And so on until Mr Price stamped disgustedly out of the office It was
easy enough and required nothing brilliant in the way of strategy or
repartee to turn Issachars attack into retreat But all the rest
of that afternoon Albert was conscious of that peculiar feeling of
uneasiness After supper that night he did not go down town at once but
sat in his room thinking deeply The subjects of his thoughts were Edwin
Raymond the young chap from New York Yale and The Neckand Helen
Kendall He succeeded only in thinking himself into an even more
uneasy and unpleasant state of mind Then he walked moodily down to
the postoffice He was a little late for the mail and the laughing and
chatting groups were already coming back after its distribution One
such group he met was made up of half a dozen young people on their way
to the drug store for ices and sodas Helen was among them and with her
was young Raymond They called to him to join them but he pretended not
to hear

Now in all the years of their acquaintance it had not once occurred
to Albert Speranza that his interest in Helen Kendall was anything
more than that of a friend and comrade He liked her had enjoyed her
societywhen he happened to be in the mood to wish societyand it
pleased him to feel that she was interested in his literary efforts
and his career She was the only girl in South Harniss who would have
talked turkey to him as she had on the day of their adventure at High
Point Light and he rather admired her for it But in all his dreams of
romantic attachments and sentimental adventure and he had such dreams
of course she had never played a part The heroines of these dreams
were beautiful and mysterious strangers not daughters of Cape Cod
clergymen

But now thanks to Issys mischievous hints his feelings were in a
puzzled and uncomfortable state He was astonished to find that he
did not relish the idea of Helens being particularly interested in Ed
Raymond He himself had not seen her as frequently of late she having
been busy with her war work and he with his own interests But that
according to his view was no reason why she should permit Raymond to
become friendly to the point of causing people to talk He was not ready
to admit that he himself cared in a sentimental way for Helen but
he resented any other fellows daring to do so And she should not
have permitted it either As a matter of fact Alberto Miguel Carlos
Speranza hitherto reigning undisputed king of hearts in South Harniss
was for the first time in his imperial life feeling the pangs of
jealousy

He stalked gloomily on to the postoffice Gertie Kendrick on the
arm of Sam Thatcher passed him and he did not even notice her Gertie
whispered to Sam that he Albert was a big stuckup nothing but
she looked back over Sams shoulder nevertheless Albert climbed the
postoffice steps and walked over to the rack of letter boxes The Snow
box contained little of interest to him and he was turning away when he
heard his name spoken

Good evening Mr Speranza said a feminine voice

Albert turned again to find Jane Kelsey and another young lady a
stranger standing beside him Miss Kelsey was one of South Harnisss
summer residents The Kelsey cottage which was larger by considerable
than the Snow house was situated on the Bay Road the most exclusive
section of the village Once and not so many years before the Bay Road
was contemptuously referred to as Poverty Lane and dwellers along its
winding weedgrown track vied with one another in shiftless shabbiness
But now all shabbiness had disappeared and manygabled cottages
proudly stood where the shanties of the Poverty Laners once humbly
leaned

Albert had known Jane Kelsey for some time They had met at one of the
hotel teadances during his second summer in South Harniss He and she
were not intimate friends exactly her mother saw to that but they were
well acquainted She was short and piquant had a nose which freckled in
the Cape Cod sunshine and she talked and laughed easily

Good evening Mr Speranza she said again You looked so very
forlorn I couldnt resist speaking Do tell us why you are so sad were
dying to know

Albert taken by surprise stammered that he didnt know that he was
sad Miss Kelsey laughed merrily and declared that everyone who saw him
knew it at once Oh excuse me Madeline she added I forgot that
you and Mr Speranza had not met Of course as youre going to live
in South Harniss you must know him without waiting another minute
Everybody knows everybody down here He is Albert Speranzaand we
sometimes call him Albert because here everybody calls everyone else
by their first names There now you know each other and its all very
proper and formal

The young lady who was her companion smiled The smile was distinctly
worth looking at as was the young lady herself for that matter

I doubt if Mr Speranza knows me very well Jane she observed

Doesnt know you Why you silly thing havent I just introduced you

Well I dont know much about South Harniss introductions but isnt it
customary to mention names You havent told him mine

Miss Kelsey laughed in high delight Oh how perfectly ridiculous
she exclaimed AlbertMr Speranza I meanthis is my friend Miss
Madeline Fosdick She is from New York and she has decided to spend her
summers in South Harnisswhich _I_ consider very good judgment Her
father is going to build a cottage for her to spend them in down on the
Bay Road on the hill at the corner above the Inlet But of course youve
heard of THAT

Of course he had The purchase of the Inlet Hill land by Fletcher
Fosdick the New York banker and the price paid Solomon Dadgett for
that land had been the principal topics of conversation around South
Harniss supper tables for the past ten days Captain Lote Snow had
summed up local opinion of the transaction when he said Well Sol
Dadgetts been talkin in prayermeetin ever since I can remember about
the comin of Paradise on earth Judgin by the price he got for the
Inlet Hill sand heap he must have callated Paradise had got here and he
was sellin the golden streets by the runnin foot Or as Laban Keeler
put it They say King Soloman was a wise man but I guess likely twas
a good thing for him that Sol Dadgett wasnt alive in his time King Sol
would have needed all his wisdom to keep Dadgett from talkin him into
buying the Jerusalem saltmash to build the temple on    Um   
Yesyesyes

So Albert as he shook hands with Miss Fosdick regarded her with
unusual interest And judging by the way in which she looked at him
she too was interested After some minutes of the usual conventional
summertime chat the young gentleman suggested that they adjourn to the
drug store for refreshments The invitation was accepted the vivacious
Miss Kelsey acting as spokesmanor spokeswomanin the matter

I think you must be a mindreader Mr Speranza she declared I am
dying for a sundae and I have just discovered that I havent my purse
or a penny with me I should have been reduced to the humiliation of
borrowing from Madeline here or asking that deaf old Burgess man to
trust me until tomorrow And he is so frightfully deaf she added in
explanation that when I asked him the last time he made me repeat it
until I thought I should die of shame or exhaustion one or the other
Every time I shouted he would say Hey and I was obliged to shout
again Of course the place was crowded andOh well I dont like
to even think about it Bless you bless you Albert Speranza And do
please lets hurry

When they entered the drug storeit also sold according to its sign
Cigars soda icecream patent medicines candy knickknacks chewing
gum souvenirs and notionsthe sextette of which Helen Kendall made
one was just leaving She nodded pleasantly to Albert and he nodded in
return but Ed Raymonds careless bow he did not choose to see He had
hitherto rather liked that young gentleman now he felt a sudden but
violent detestation for him

Sundaes pleasant to the palate and disastrous to all but youthful
digestions were ordered Alberts had a slight flavor of gall and
wormwood but he endeavored to counterbalance this by the sweetness
derived from the society of Jane Kelsey and her friend His conversation
was particularly brilliant and sparkling that evening Jane laughed much
and chatted more Miss Fosdick was quieter but she too appeared to be
enjoying herself Jane demanded to know how the poems were developing
She begged him to have an inspiration nowDo PLEASE so that Madeline
and I can see you It seemed to be her idea that having an inspiration
was similar to having a fit Miss Fosdick laughed at this but she
declared that she adored poetry and specified certain poems which were
objects of her especial adoration The conversation thereafter became
what Miss Kelsey described as high brow and took the form of a
dialogue between Miss Fosdick and Albert It was interrupted by the
arrival of the Kelsey limousine which rolled majestically up to the
drug store steps Jane spied it first

Oh mercy me heres mother she exclaimed And your mother too
Madeline We are tracked to our lair    No no Mr Speranza you
mustnt go out No really we had rather you wouldnt Thanks ever so
much for the sundaes Come Madeline

Miss Fosdick held out her hand

Thank you Mr Speranza she said I have enjoyed our poetry talk SO
much It must be wonderful to write as you do Good night

She looked admiringly into his eyes as she said it In spite of the gall
and wormwood Albert found it not at all unpleasant to be looked at in
that way by a girl like Madeline Fosdick His reflections on that point
were interrupted by a voice from the car

Come Madeline come it said fussily What ARE you waiting for

Albert caught a glimpse of a majestic figure which seated beside Mrs
Kelsey on the rear seat of the limousine towered above that short
plump lady as a dreadnaught towers above a coal barge He surmised this
figure to be that of the maternal Fosdick Madeline climbed in beside
her parent and the limousine rolled away

Alberts goingtobed reflections that evening were divided in flavor
like a fruit sundae a combination of sweet and sour The sour was
furnished by thoughts of Edwin Raymond and Helen Kendall the formers
presumption in daring to seek her society as he did and Helens
amazing silliness in permitting such a thing The sweet of course was
furnished by a voice which repeated to his memory the words It must be
wonderful to write as you do Also the tone of that voice and the look
in the eyes

Could he have been privileged to hear the closing bits of a conversation
which was taking place at that moment his reflections might have been
still further saccharined Miss Jane Kelsey was saying And NOW what
do you think of our Cape Cod poet Didnt I promise you to show you
something you couldnt find on Fifth Avenue And to this Miss Madeline
Fosdick made reply I think he is the handsomest creature I ever saw
And so clever Why he is wonderful Jane How in the world does he
happen to be living hereall the time

It is perhaps on the whole a good thing that Albert Speranza could not
hear this It is certainly a good thing that Captain Zelotes Snow did
not hear it

And although the balance of sweet and sour in Alberts mind that
night was almost even the sour predominated next day and continued to
predominate Issachar Price had sowed the seed of jealousy in the mind
of the assistant bookkeeper of Z Snow and Company and that seed took
root and grew as it is only too likely to do under such circumstances
That evening Albert walked again to the postoffice Helen was not
there neither was Miss Kelsey or Miss Fosdick He waited for a time and
then determined to call at the Kendall home something he had not done
for some time As he came up to the front walk between the arborvitae
hedges he saw that the parlor windows were alight The window shade was
but partially drawn and beneath it he could see into the room Helen was
seated at the piano and Edwin Raymond was standing beside her ready to
turn the page of her music

Albert whirled on his heel and walked out of the yard and down the
street toward his own home His attitude of mind was a curious one
He had a mind to wait until Raymond left and then go into the Kendall
parlor and demand of Helen to know what she meant by letting that fellow
make such a fool of himself What right had heRaymondto call upon
her and turn her music andand set the whole town talking WhyOh
he could think of many things to ask and say The trouble was that the
saying of them would he felt sure be distinctly bad diplomacy on his
part No onenot even hecould talk to Helen Kendall in that fashion
not unless he wished it to be their final conversation

So he went home to fret and toss angrily and miserably half the night
He had never before considered himself in the slightest degree in love
with Helen but he had taken for granted the thought that she liked him
better than anyone else Now he was beginning to fear that perhaps
she did not and with his temperament wounded vanity and poetic
imagination supplied the rest Within a fortnight he considered himself
desperately in love with her

During this fortnight he called at the parsonage the Kendall home
several times On the first of these occasions the Reverend Mr Kendall
having just completed a sermon dealing with the war and being full of
his subject read the said sermon to his daughter and to Albert The
reading itself lasted for threequarters of an hour and Mr Kendalls
postargument and general dissertation on German perfidy another hour
after that By that time it was late and Albert went home The second
call was even worse for Ed Raymond called also and the two young men
glowered at each other until ten oclock They might have continued to
glower indefinitely for neither meant to leave before the other but
Helen announced that she had some homestudy papers to look over and she
knew they would excuse her under the circumstances On that hint
they departed simultaneously separating at the gate and walking with
deliberate dignity in opposite directions

At his third attempt however Albert was successful to the extent
that Helen was alone when he called and there was no school work to
interrupt But in no other respect was the interview satisfactory
All that week he had been boiling with the indignation of the landed
proprietor who discovers a trespasser on his estate and before this
call was fifteen minutes old his feelings had boiled over

What IS the matter with you Al asked Helen Do tell me and lets
see if I cant help you out of your trouble

Her visitor flushed Trouble he repeated stiffly I dont know what
you mean

Oh yes do You must What IS the matter

There is nothing the matter with me

Nonsense Of course there is You have scarcely spoken a word of
your own accord since you came and you have been scowling like a
thundercloud all the time Now what is it Have I done something you
dont like

There is nothing the matter I tell you

Please dont be so silly Of course there is I thought there must
be something wrong the last time you were here that evening when Ed
called too It seemed to me that you were rather queer then Now you
are queerer still What is it

This straightforward attack although absolutely characteristic of
Helen was disconcerting Albert met it by an attack of his own

Helen he demanded what does that Raymond fellow mean by coming to
see you as he does

Now whether or not Helen was entirely in the dark as to the cause of her
visitors queerness is a question not to be answered here She was far
from being a stupid young person and it is at least probable that she
may have guessed a little of the truth But being feminine she did not
permit Albert to guess that she had guessed If her astonishment at the
question was not entirely sincere it certainly appeared to be so

What does he mean she repeated What does he mean by coming to see
me Why what do YOU mean I should think that was the question Why
shouldnt he come to see me pray

Now Albert has a dozen reasons in his mind each of which was to him
sufficiently convincing But expressing those reasons to Helen Kendall
he found singularly difficult He grew confused and stammered

Wellwell because he has no business to come here so much was the
best he could do Helen strange to say was not satisfied

Has no business to she repeated Why of course he has I asked him
to come

You did Good heavens you dont LIKE him do you

Of course I like him I think he is a very nice fellow Dont you

No I dont

Why not

Wellwell because I dont thats all He has no business to
monopolize you all the time Why he is here about every night in the
week or youre out with him down town oror somewhere Everybody is
talking about it and

Wait a minute please You say everybody is talking about Ed Raymond
and me What do you mean by that What are they saying

Theyre saying    Oh theyre saying you and he areare

Are what

AreareOh theyre saying all sorts of things Look here Helen
I

Wait I want to know more about this What have you heard said about
me

Oh a lot of things    That iserwell nothing in particular
perhaps but

Wait Who have you heard saying it

Oh never mind Helen

But I do mind Who have you heard saying this lot of things about
me

Nobody I tell you    Oh well if you must know Issy Price
saidwell he said you and this Raymond fellow were what he called
keeping company andand that the whole town was talking about it

She slowly shook her head

Issy Price she repeated And you listened to what Issy Price said
Issy Price of all people

Wellwell he said everyone else said the same thing

Did he say more than that

No but that was enough wasnt it Besides the rest was plain I
could see it myself He is calling here about every night in the week
andand being around everywhere with you andandOh anyone can see

Helens usually placid temper was beginning to ruffle

Very well she said then they may see Why shouldnt he call here if
he wishesand I wish Why shouldnt I be around with him as you say
Why not

Well because I dont like it It isnt the right thing for you to do
You ought to be more careful ofof what people say

He realized almost as soon as this last sentence was blurted out the
absolute tactlessness of it The quiet gleam of humor he had so often
noticed in Helens eyes was succeeded now by a look he had never before
seen there

Oh Im sorry he added hastily I beg your pardon Helen I didnt
mean to say that Forgive me will you

She did not answer immediately Then she said I dont know whether I
shall or not I think I shall have to think it over And perhaps you had
better go now

But IM sorry Helen It was a fool thing to say I dont know why I
was such an idiot Do forgive me come

She slowly shook her head I cantyet she said And this you must
understand If Ed Raymond or anyone else calls on me and I choose to
permit it or if I choose to go out with him anywhere at any time that
is my affair and not everyone elseswhich includes Issachar Price
And my FRIENDSmy real friendswill not listen to mean ridiculous
gossip Good night

So that was the end of that attempt at asserting the Divine Right by
the South Harniss king of hearts Albert was more miserable than ever
angrier than evernot only at Raymond and Helen but at himselfand
his newlydiscovered jealousy burned with a brighter and greener flame
The idea of throwing everything overboard going to Canada and enlisting
in the Canadian Armyan idea which had had a strong and alluring appeal
ever since the war broke outcame back with redoubled force But there
was the agreement with his grandfather He had given his word how could
he break it Besides to go away and leave his rival with a clear field
did not appeal to him either

On a Wednesday evening in the middle of September the final social event
of the South Harniss summer season was to take place The Society for
the Relief of the French Wounded was to give a dance in the ballroom of
the hotel the proceeds from the sale of tickets to be devoted to the
purpose defined by the name of this organization Every last member
of the summer colony was to attend of course and all those of the
permanent residents who aspired to social distinction and cared to pay
the high price of admission

Albert was going naturally That is he had at first planned to go
thenafter the disastrous call at the parsonagedecided that he would
go under no circumstances and at the last changed his mind once more
to the affirmative Miss Madeline Fosdick Jane Kelseys friend was
responsible for the final change She it was who had sold him his ticket
and urged him to be present He and she had met several times since
the first meeting at the postoffice Usually when they met they talked
concerning poetry and kindred lofty topics Albert liked Miss Fosdick
It is hard not to like a pretty attractive young lady who takes such a
flattering interest in ones aspirations and literary efforts The high
brow chitchatsquoting Miss Kelsey againwere pleasant in many
ways for instance they were in the nature of a tonic for weakened
selfesteem and the Speranza selfesteem was suffering just at this
time from shock

Albert had when he first heard that the dance was to take place
intended inviting Helen to accompany him He had taken her acceptance
for granted he having acted as her escort to so many dances and
social affairs So he neglected inviting her and then came Issys
mischiefmaking remarks and the trouble which followed So as inviting
her was out of the question he resolved not to attend himself But
Miss Fosdick urged so prettily that he bought his ticket and promised to
be among those present

Provided of course he ventured being in a reckless mood that you
save me at least four dances She raised her brows in mock dismay

Oh my goodness she exclaimed Im afraid I couldnt do that Four
is much too many One I will promise but no more

However as he persisted she yielded another He was to have two dances
and possibly an extra

And you are a lucky young man declared Jane Kelsey who had also
promised two If you knew how many fellows have begged for just one
But of course she added THEY were not poets second editions of
Tennyson and Keats and all that It is Keats who was the poet isnt it
Madeline she added turning to her friend Oh Im so glad I got it
right the first time Im always mixing him up with Watts the man who
invented the hymns and wrote the steamengineor something

The Wednesday evening in the middle of September was a beautiful one
and the hotel was crowded The Item in its account the following week
enumerating those present spoke of Our new residents Mrs Fletcher
Story Fosdick and Miss Madeline Fosdick who are to occupy the
magnificent residence now about being built on the Inlet Hill by their
husband and father respectively Fletcher Story Fosdick Esquire the
wellknown New York banker The phrasing of this news note caused
much joy in South Harniss and the Item gained several new and hopeful
subscribers

But when the gushing reporter responsible for this added that Miss
Fosdick was a dream of loveliness on this occasion he was stating only
the truth She was very beautiful indeed and a certain young man who
stepped up to claim his first dance realized the fact The said young
man was outwardly cool but redhot within the internal rise in
temperature being caused by the sight of Helen Kendall crossing the
floor arm in arm with Edwin Raymond Alberts face was white with anger
except for two red spots on his cheeks and his black eyes flashed
Consequently he too was considered quite worth the looking at and
feminine glances followed him

Who is that handsome foreignlooking fellow your friend is dancing
with whispered one young lady a guest at the hotel to Miss Kelsey
Jane told her

But he isnt a foreigner she added He lives here in South Harniss
all the year He is a poet I believe and Madeline who knows about
such thingsinherits it from her mother I supposesays his poetry is
beautiful

Her companion watched the subject of their conversation as with Miss
Fosdick he moved lightly and surely through the crowd on the floor

He LOOKS like a poet she said slowly He is wonderfully handsome
so distinguished and SUCH a dancer But why should a poet live
hereall the year Is that all he does for a livingwrite poetry

Jane pretended not to hear her and a masculine friend coming to claim
his dance seized the opportunity to escape However another sitter
out supplied the information

He is a sort of assistant bookkeeper at the lumber yard by the railroad
station said this person His grandfather owns the place I believe
One would never guess it to look at him now    Humph I wonder if
Mrs Fosdick knows They say she iswell not democratically inclined
to say the least

Albert had his two promised dances with Madeline Fosdick but the
extra he did not obtain Mrs Fosdick the ever watchful had seen
and made inquiries Then she called her daughter to her and issued an
ultimatum

I am SO sorry said the young lady in refusing the plea for the
extra I should like to but Ibut Mother has asked me to dance with
a friend of ours from home II AM sorry really

She looked as if she meant it Albert was sorry too This had been
a strange evening another combination of sweet and sour He glanced
across the floor and saw Helen and the inevitable Raymond emerge
together from the room where the refreshments were served Raging
jealousy seized him at the sight Helen had not been near him had
scarcely spoken to him since his arrival He forgot that he had not been
near nor spoken to her

He danced twice or thrice more with acquaintances summer or
permanent and then decided to go home Madeline Fosdick he saw at the
other end of the room surrounded by a group of young masculinity
Helen he could not see at the moment He moved in the direction of the
coatroom Just as he reached the door he was surprised to see Ed Raymond
stride by him head down and looking anything but joyful He watched and
was still more astonished to see the young man get his coat and hat from
the attendant and walk out of the hotel He saw him stride away
along the drive and down the moonlit road He was apparently going
homegoing home alone

He got his own coat and hat and before putting them on stepped back
for a final look at the ballroom As he stood by the cloakroom door
someone touched his arm Turning he saw Helen

Whywhy Helen he exclaimed in surprise

Are you going home she asked in a low tone

Yes I

And you are going alone

Yes

Would you mindwould it trouble you too much to walk with me as far as
our house

Whywhy of course not I shall be delighted But I thought youI
thought Ed Raymond

No Im alone Wait here I will be ready in just a minute

She hurried away He gazed after her in bewilderment She and he had
scarcely exchanged a word during the evening and now when the evening
was almost over she came and asked him to be her escort What in the
wide world

The minute she had specified had hardly elapsed when she reappeared
ready for out of doors She took his arm and they walked down the steps
of the hotel past the group of lights at the head of the drive and
along the road with the moon shining down upon it and the damp salt
breeze from the ocean blowing across it They walked for the first few
minutes in silence There were a dozen questions he would have liked to
ask but his jealous resentment had not entirely vanished and his pride
forbade It was she who spoke first

Albert she said you must think this very odd

He knew what she meant but he did not choose to admit it

What he asked

Why my asking you to walk home with me afterafter our trouble It
is strange I suppose particularly as you had not spoken before this
whole evening

_I_spoken to YOU Why you bowed to me when I came into the room and
that was the only sign of recognition you gave me until just now Not a
dancenot one

Did you expect me to look you up and beg you to dance with me

Did you expect me to trot at that fellows heels and wait my chance to
get a word with you to take what he left I should say not By George
Helen I

She interrupted him Hush hush she pleaded This is all so silly
so childish And we mustnt quarrel any more I have made up my mind to
that We mustnt

Humph All right _I_ had no thought of quarreling in the beginning
But there are some things a selfrespecting chap cant stand I have
SOME pride I hope

She caught her breath quickly Do you think she asked that it was
no sacrifice to my pride to beg you to walk home with me Afterafter
the things you said the other evening Oh Albert how could you say
them

Well he hesitated and then added I told you I was sorry

Yes but you werent really sorry You must have believed the things
that hateful Issachar Price said or you wouldnt have repeated them
   Oh but never mind that now I didnt mean to speak of it at all I
asked you to walk home with me because I wanted to make up our quarrel
Yes that was it I didnt want to go away and feel that you and I were
not as good friends as ever So you see I put all MY pride to one
sideand asked

One phrase in one sentence of this speech caught and held the young
mans attention He forgot the others

You are going away he repeated What do you mean Where are you
going

I am going to Cambridge to study I am going to take some courses at
Radcliffe You know I told you I hoped to some day Well it has
been arranged I am to live with my cousin fathers half sister in
Somerville Father is well enough to leave now and I have engaged a
capable woman Mrs Peters to help Maria with the housework I am going
Friday morning the day after tomorrow

He stopped short to stare at her

You are going away he asked again You are going to do that
andandWhy didnt you tell me before

It was a characteristic return to his attitude of outraged royalty She
had made all these plans had arranged to do this thing and he had
not been informed At another time Helen might have laughed at him she
generally did when he became what she called the Grand Bashaw She did
not laugh now however but answered quietly

I didnt know I was going to do it until a little more than a week
ago she said And I have not seen you since then

No youve been too busy seeing someone else

She lost patience for the instant Oh dont dont dont she cried
I know who you mean of course You mean Ed Raymond Dont you know why
he has been at the house so much of late Why he and I have been so much
together Dont you really know

What    No I dontexcept that you and he wanted to be together

And it didnt occur to you that there might be some other reason You
forgot I suppose that he and I were appointed on the Ticket Committee
for this very dance

He had forgotten it entirely Now he remembered perfectly the meeting
of the French Relief Society at which the appointment had been made In
fact Helen herself had told him of it at the time For the moment he was
staggered but he rallied promptly

Committee meetings may do as an excuse for some things he said but
they dont explain the resthis calls here every other evening andand
so on Honest now Helen you know he hasnt been running after you in
this way just because he is on that committee with you now dont you

They were almost at the parsonage The light from Mr Kendalls study
window shone through the leaves of the lilac bush behind the white
fence Helen started to speak but hesitated He repeated his question

Now dont you he urged

Why why yes I suppose I do she said slowly I do knownow But
I didnt even think of such a thing untiluntil you came that evening
and told me what Issy Price said

You mean you didnt guess at all

Wellwell perhaps II thought he liked to comeliked toOh what
is the use of being silly I did think he liked to call but only as a
friend He was jolly and lots of fun and we were both fond of music I
enjoyed his company I never dreamed that there was anything more than
that until you came and were sodisagreeable And even then I didnt
believeuntil tonight

Again she hesitated Tonight he repeated What happened tonight

Oh nothing I cant tell you Oh why cant friends be friends and not
   That is why I spoke to you Albert why I wanted to have this talk
with you I was going away so soon and I couldnt bear to go with any
unfriendliness between us There mustnt be Dont you see

He heard but a part of this The memory of Raymonds face as he had seen
it when the young man strode out of the cloakroom and out of the hotel
came back to him and with it a great heartthrobbing sense of relief of
triumph He seized her hand

Helen he cried did hedid you tell himOh by George Helen
youre the most wonderful girl in the world ImIOh Helen you know
II

It was not his habit to be at a loss for words but he was just then He
tried to retain her hand to put his arm about her

Oh Helen he cried Youre wonderful Youre splendid Im crazy
about you I really am I

She pushed him gently away Dont Please dont she said Oh
dont

But I must Dont you see I    Why youre crying

Her face had for a moment been upturned The moon at that moment had
slipped behind a cloud but the lamplight from the window had shown
him the tears in her eyes He was amazed He could have shouted have
laughed aloud from joy or triumphant exultation just then but to weep
What occasion was there for tears except on Ed Raymonds part

Youre crying he repeated Why Helen

Dont she said again Oh dont Please dont talk that way

But dont you want me to Helen II want you to know how I feel You
dont understand I

Hush    Dont Al dont please Dont talk in that way I dont
want you to

But why not

Oh because I dont Itsit is foolish Youre only a boy you know

A boy Im more than a year older than you are

Are you Why yes I suppose you are really But that doesnt make any
difference I guess girls are older than boys when they are our age
lots older

Oh bother all that We arent kids either of us I want you to
listen You dont understand what Im trying to say

Yes I do But Im sure you dont You are glad because you have
found you have no reason to be jealous of Ed Raymond and that makes you
sayfoolish things But Im not going to have our friendship spoiled
in that way I want us to be real friends always So you mustnt be
silly

Im not silly Helen if you wont listen to anything else will you
listen to this Will you promise me that while you are away you wont
have other fellows calling on you oror anything like that And Ill
promise you that Ill have nothing to say to another girlin any way
that counts I mean Shall we promise each other that Helen Come

She paused for some moment before answering but her reply when it
came was firm

No she said I dont think we should promise anything except to
remain friends You might promise and then be sorry later

_I_ might How about you

Perhaps we both might So we wont take the risk You may come and see
me tomorrow evening and say goodby if you like But you mustnt stay
long It is my last night with father for some time and I mustnt cheat
him out of it Good night Albert Im so glad our misunderstanding is
over arent you

Of course I am But Helen

I must go in now Good night

The reflections of Alberto Speranza during his walk back to the Snow
place were varied but wonderful He thought of Raymonds humiliation
and gloried in it He thought of Helen and rhapsodized And if
occasionally he thought also of the dance and of Madeline Fosdick
forgive him He was barely twentyone and the moon was shining



CHAPTER IX


The goodby call the following evening was to him at least not very
satisfactory Helen was tired having been busy all day with the final
preparations for leaving and old Mr Kendall insisted on being present
during the entire visit and in telling long and involved stories of the
trip abroad he had made when a young man and the unfavorable opinion
which he had then formed of Prussians as traveling companions Alberts
opinion of Prussians was at least as unfavorable as his own but his
complete and even eager agreement with each of the old gentlemans
statements did not have the effect of choking the latter off but rather
seemed to act as encouragement for more When ten oclock came and it
was time to go Albert felt as if he had been listening to a lecture on
the Hohenzollerns Great Scott Helen he whispered as she came to
the door with him I dont feel as if I had talked with you a minute
Why I scarcely

But just here Mr Kendall came hurrying from the sittingroom to tell
of one incident which he had hitherto forgotten and so even this brief
interval of privacy was denied But Albert made one more attempt

Im going to run over to the station tomorrow morning to see you off
he called from the gate Good night

The morning train left at nine oclock and at a quarter to nine Albert
who had kept his eye on the clock ever since eight his hour of arriving
at the office called to Mr Price

I say he said in a low tone and one as casual as he could assume I
am going to run out for a few minutes Ill be right back

Issachars response was as usual anything but low

Eh he shouted Goin out Where you goin

Oh Im just going outeron an errand

What kind of an errand I was callatin to run out myself for a little
spell Cant I do your errand for you

No no   There there dont bother me any more Im in a hurry

Hurry Som I in a hurry I was callatin to run acrost to the deepo
and see Helen Kendall start for Boston Shes goin this morning did
you know it

Before the somewhat flustered assistant bookkeeper could reply Captain
Zelotes called from the inner office

Wouldnt wonder if that was where Al was bound too he observed And
I was thinkin of the same thing Suppose we all go together Labell
keep shop wont you Labe

Mr Keeler looked over his spectacles Eh he observed Oh yes yes
   yes yes yes And say goodby to Helen for me some of you if
you happen to think of it Not that twill make much difference to her
he added whether she gets my goodbys or not but it might make some
to me    Um yes yes

Mr Price was eager to oblige

Ill tell her you sent em Labe he said patronizingly Set your
mind to rest Ill tell her

Labans lip twitched Much obliged Is he chirruped Thats a great
relief My minds rested some already

So instead of going alone to the railway station Albert made one of a
delegation of three And at the station was Mr Kendall and two of the
school committee and one or two members of the church sewing circle
and the president and secretary of the Society for the Relief of the
French Wounded So far from being an intimate confidential farewell
Helens departure was in the nature of a public ceremony with
speechmaking Mr Price made most of the speeches in fact the lower
portion of his countenance was in violent motion most of the ten
minutes

Take care of yourself Helen he urged loudly Dont you worry about
your pa well look out for him And dont let none of them Boston
fellers carry you off Well watch and see that Eddie Raymond and Al
here dont get into mischief while youre gone I    Crimustee Jim
Young what in times the matter with you Cant ye see nothin

This last outburst was directed at the driver of the depotwagon who
wheeling a trunk on a baggage truck had bumped violently into the rear
of Mr Prices legs just at the knee joint causing their owner to bend
backward unexpectedly and with enthusiasm

Cant you see nothin when its right in front of ye demanded
Issachar righteously indignant

Jim Young winked over his shoulder at Albert Sorry Is he said as
he continued toward the baggage car I didnt notice you WAS in front
of me

Well then youd better    Eh See here what do you mean by
that

Even after Mr Price had thus been pushed out of the foreground so to
speak Albert was denied the opportunity of taking his place by Helens
side Her father had a few last messages to deliver then Captain
Zelotes shook her hand and talked for a moment and after that the
ladies of the sewing circle and the war work society felt it their duty
to severally and jointly kiss her goodby This last was a trying
operation to watch

Then the engine bell rang and the train began to move Albert running
beside the platform of the last car held up his hand for a farewell
clasp

Goodby he said and added in a whisper Youll write wont you

Of course And so must you Goodby

The last car and the handkerchief waving figure on its platform
disappeared around the curve The little group by the station broke up
Albert and his grandfather walked over to the office together

There goes a good girl Al was Captain Lotes only comment A mighty
good capable girl

Albert nodded A moment later he lifted his hat to a group in a passing
automobile

Who were those folks asked the Captain

The Fosdicks was the reply The people who are going to build down
by the Inlet

It was Madeline and her mother The latter had been serenely
indifferent but the young lady had smiled and bowed behind the maternal
shoulders

Oh that so observed Captain Zelotes looking after the flying car
with interest Thats who tis eh Nice lookin the young one aint
she

Albert did not answer With the noise of the train which was carrying
Helen out of his life still ringing in his ears it seemed wicked even to
mention another girls name to say nothing of commenting upon her good
looks For the rest of that day he was a gloomy spirit a dark shadow in
the office of Z Snow and Co

Before the end of another fortnight the season at South Harniss was
definitely over The hotel closed on the Saturday following the dance
and by October first the last of the cottages was locked and shuttered
The Kelseys went on the twentieth and the Fosdicks went with them
Albert met Madeline and Jane at the postoffice in the evening of the
nineteenth and there more farewells were said

Dont forget us down here in the sand will you he suggested to Miss
Fosdick It was Jane Kelsey who answered

Oh she wont forget returned that young lady Why she has your
photograph to remember you by

Madeline colored becomingly and was as Jane described it awfully
fussed

Nonsense she exclaimed with much indignation I havent any such
thing You know I havent Jane

Yes you have my dear You have a photograph of him standing in front
of the drug store and looking dreamily in atat the strawberry sundaes
It is a most romantic pose really

Albert laughed He remembered the photograph It was one of a series of
snapshots taken with Miss Kelseys camera one Saturday afternoon when
a party of young people had met in front of the sundae dispensary Jane
had insisted on snapping everyone

That reminds me that I have never seen the rest of those photographs
he said

Havent you exclaimed Jane Well you ought to see them I have
Madelines with me It is a dream if I do say it as I took it

She produced the snapshot which showed her friend standing beside the
silverleaf tree before the druggists window and smiling at the camera
It was a good likeness and consequently a very pretty picture

Isnt it a dream just as I said demanded the artist Honest now
isnt it

Albert of course declared it to be beyond praise

May I have this one he asked on the impulse of the moment

Dont ask me stupid commanded Jane mischievously It isnt my
funeralor my portrait either

May I he repeated turning to Madeline She hesitated

Whywhy yes you may if you care for it she said That particular
one is Janes anyway and if she chooses to give it away I dont see
how I can prevent her But why you should want the old thing I cant
conceive I look as stiff and wooden as a signpost

Jane held up a protesting finger

Fibs fibs fibs she observed Cant conceive why he should want it
As if you werent perfectly aware that he will wear it next his heart
andOh dont put it in THAT pocket I said next your heart and that
isnt on your RIGHT side

Albert took the photograph home and stuck it between the frame and glass
of his bureau Then came a sudden remembrance of his parting with Helen
and with it a twinge of conscience He had begged her to have nothing
to do with any other fellow True she had refused to promise and
consequently he also was unbound but that made no differenceshould
not make any So he put the photograph at the back of the drawer where
he kept his collars and ties with a resolve never to look at it He did
not look at itvery often

Then came another long winter He ground away at the bookkeepinghe was
more proficient at it but he hated it as heartily as everand wrote
a good deal of verse and some prose For the first time he sold a prose
article a short story to a minor magazine He wrote long letters to
Helen and she replied She was studying hard she liked her work and
she had been offered the opportunity to tutor in a girls summer camp in
Vermont during July and August and meant to accept provided her fathers
health continued good Albert protested violently against her being
absent from South Harniss for so long You will scarcely be home at
all he wrote I shall hardly see you What am I going to do As it
is now I miss you and so on for four closely written pages Having
gotten into the spirit of composition he so to speak gloried in his
loneliness so much so that Helen was moved to remonstrate Your letter
made me almost miserable she wrote until I had read it over twice
Then I began to suspect that you were enjoying your wretchedness
or enjoying writing about it I truly dont believe anyoneyou
especiallycould be quite as lonesome as all that Honestly now
Albert werent you exaggerating a little I rather think you were

He had been of course but it irritated him to think that she
recognized the fact She had an uncanny faculty of seeing through his
every pretense In his next letter he said nothing whatever about being
lonesome

At home and at the office the war was what people talked about most
of the time Since the Lusitanias sinking Captain Zelotes had been a
battle charger chafing at the bit He wanted to fight and to fight at
once

Weve got to do it Mother he declared over and over again Sooner
or later weve got to fight that Kaiser gang What are we waitin for
will somebody tell me that

Olive as usual was mild and unruffled

Probably the President knows as much about it as you and me Zelotes
she suggested I presume likely he has his own reasons

Humph When Seth Bassett got up in the night and took a drink out of
the bottle of Paris Green by mistake Bial Cahoon asked him what in time
he kept Paris Green in his bedroom for anyhow All that Seth would say
was that he had his own reasons The rest of the town was left to guess
what those reasons was Thats what the Presidents doinkeepin us
guessin By the everlastin if I was younger Id ship aboard a British
limejuicer and go and fight myself

It was Rachel Ellis who caused the Captain to be a bit more restrained
in his remarks

You hadnt ought to talk that way Capn Lote she said Not when
Alberts around you hadnt

Eh Why not

Because the first thing you know hell be startin for Canada to
enlist Hes been crazy to do it for most a year

He has How do you know he has

Because hes told me so moren once

Her employer looked at her

Humph he grunted He seems to tell you a good many things he doesnt
tell the rest of us

The housekeeper nodded Yes she said gravely I shouldnt wonder
if he did A moment later she added Capn Lote you will be careful
wont you You wouldnt want Al to go off and leave Z Snow and Company
when him and you are gettin on so much better You ARE gettin on
better aint you

The captain pulled at his beard

Yes he admitted seems as if we was He aint any wonder at
bookkeepin but hes bettern he used to be and he does seem to try
hard Ill say that for him

Rachael beamed gratification Hell be a Robert Penfold yet she
declared see if he isnt So you musnt encourage him into enlistin
in the Canadian army You wouldnt want him to do that any moren the
rest of us would

The captain gazed intently into the bowl of the pipe which he had been
cleaning He made no answer

You wouldnt want him to do that would you repeated the housekeeper

Captain Lote blew through the pipe stem Then he said No I wouldnt
   but Im darn glad hes got the spunk to WANT to do it We may
get that Portygee streak out of him poetry and all give us time eh
Rachael

It was the first time in months that he had used the word Portygee in
connection with his grandson Mrs Ellis smiled to herself

In April the arbutus buds began to appear above the leaf mold between
the scrub oaks in the woods and the walls of Fletcher Fosdicks new
summer home began to rise above the young pines on the hill by the
Inlet in the Bay Road The Item kept its readers informed by weekly
installments of the progress made by the builders


The lumber for Mr Fletcher Fosdicks new cottage is beginning to be
hauled to his property on Inlet Hill in this town Our enterprising firm
of South Harniss dealers Z Snow  Co are furnishing said lumber
Mr Nehemiah Nickerson is to do the mason work Mr Fosdick shows good
judgment as well as a commendable spirit in engaging local talent in
this way We venture to say he will never regret it


A week later


Mr Fletcher Fosdicks new residence is beginning building the
foundation being pretty near laid


And the following week


The Fosdick mansion is growing fast South Harniss may well be proud of
its new ornament


The rise in three successive numbers from cottage to mansion is
perhaps sufficient to indicate that the Fosdick summer home was to be
as Issachar Price described it Some considerable house Yes sir by
crimus some considerable

In June Helen came home for a week At the end of the week she left to
take up her new duties at the summer camp for girls in Vermont Albert
and she were together a good deal during that week Anticipating her
arrival the young mans ardent imagination had again fanned what he
delighted to think of as his love for her into flame During the
last months of the winter he had not played the languishing swain as
conscientiously as during the autumn Like the sailor in the song
is eart was true to Poll always but he had broken away from his
selfimposed hermitage in his room at the Snow place several times
to attend sociables entertainments and even dances Now when
she returned he was eagerly awaiting her and would have haunted the
parsonage before and after working hours of every day as well as the
evening if she had permitted and when with her assumed a proprietary
air which was so obvious that even Mr Price felt called upon to comment
on it

Say Al drawled Issachar callate youve cut out Eddie Raymond
along with Helen aint ye Dont see him hangin around any since she
got back and the way you was actin when I see you struttin into the
parsonage yard last night afore mail time made me think you must have a
first mortgage on Helen and her pa and the house and the meetinhouse
and twothirds of the graveyard I never see such an importantlookin
critter in MY life Haw haw Eh How bout it

Albert did not mind the Price sarcasm instead he felt rather grateful
to have the proletariat recognize that he had triumphed again The fly
in his ointment so to speak was the fact that Helen herself did not in
the least recognize that triumph She laughed at him

Dont look at me like that please please dont she begged

Why not with a repetition of the look

Because it is silly

Silly Well I like that Arent you and I engaged Or just the same as
engaged

No of course we are not

But we promised each other

No we did not And you know we didnt

Helen why do you treat me that way Dont you know thatthat I just
worship the ground you tread on Dont you know youre the only girl in
this world I could ever care for Dont you know that

They were walking home from church Sunday morning and had reached the
corner below the parsonage There screened by the thicket of young
silverleafs she stopped momentarily and looked into his face Then she
walked on

Dont you know how much I care he repeated

She shook her head You think you do now perhaps she said but you
will change your mind

What do you mean by that How do you know I will

Because I know you There there Albert we wont quarrel will we
And we wont be silly Youre an awfully nice boy but you are just a
boy you know

He was losing his temper

This is ridiculous he declared Im tired of being grandmothered
by you Im older than you are and I know what Im doing Come Helen
listen to me

But she would not listen and although she was always kind and frank and
friendly she invariably refused to permit him to become sentimental It
irritated him and after she had gone the irritation still remained He
wrote her as before although not quite so often and the letters were
possibly not quite so long His pride was hurt and the Speranza pride
was a tender and important part of the Speranza being If Helen noted
any change in his letters she did not refer to it nor permit it to
influence her own which were as always lengthy cheerful and full of
interest in him and his work and thoughts

During the previous fall while under the new influence aroused in him
by his discovery that Helen Kendall was the most wonderful girl in the
world said discovery of course having been previously made for him by
the unfortunate Raymond he had developed a habit of wandering off into
the woods or by the seashore to be alone and to seek inspiration When
a young poet is in love or fancies himself in love inspiration is
usually to be found wherever sought but even at that age and to one in
that condition solitude is a marked aid in the search There were two
or three spots which had become Albert Speranzas favorites One was a
high windswept knoll overlooking the bay about a half mile from the
hotel another was a secluded nook in the pine grove beside Carvers
Pond a pretty little sheet of water on the Bayport boundary On
pleasant Saturday afternoons or Sundays when the poetic fit was on
him Albert with a half dozen pencils in his pocket and a rhyming
dictionary and a scribbling pad in another was wont to stroll towards
one or the other of these two retreats There he would sprawl amid the
beachgrass or upon the pineneedles and dream and think and perhaps
ultimately write

One fair Saturday in late June he was at the first of these respective
points Lying prone on the beach grass at the top of the knoll and
peering idly out between its stems at the water shimmering in the summer
sun he was endeavoring to find a subject for a poem which should deal
with love and war as requested by the editor of the Columbian Magazine
Give us something with a girl and a soldier in it the editor had
written Alberts mind was lazily drifting in search of the pleasing
combination

The sun was warm the breeze was light the horizon was veiled with a
liquid haze Alberts mind was veiled with a similar haze and the idea
he wanted would not come He was losing his desire to find it and was
in fact dropping into a doze when aroused by a bloodcurdling outburst
of barks and yelps and growls behind him at his very heels He came
out of his nap with a jump and scrambling to a sitting position and
turning he saw a small Boston bullterrier standing within a yard of
his ankles and apparently trying to turn his brindled outside in or
his inside out with spiteful ferocity Plainly the dog had come upon
him unexpectedly and was expressing alarm suspicion and disapproval

Albert jerked his ankles out of the way and said Hello boy in as
cheerfully cordial a tone as he could muster at such short notice The
dog took a step forward evidently with the idea of always keeping the
ankles within jumping distance showed a double row of healthy teeth and
growled and barked with renewed violence

Nice dog observed Albert The nice dog made a snap at the nearest
ankle and balked of his prey by a frenzied kick of the foot attached to
the ankle shrieked snarled and gurgled like a canine lunatic

Go home you ugly brute commanded the young man losing patience and
looking about for a stone or stick On the top of that knoll the largest
stone was the size of a buckshot and the nearest stick was to be Irish
a straw

Nice doggie Nice old boy Come and be patted    Clear out with
you Go home you beast

Flatteries and threats were alike in their result The dog continued to
snarl and growl darting toward the ankles occasionally Evidently he
was mustering courage for the attack Albert in desperation scooped up
a handful of sand If worst came to worst he might blind the creature
temporarily What would happen after that was not clear Unless he might
by a lucky cast fill the dogs interior so full of sand thatlike the
famous Jumping Frogit would be too heavy to navigate he saw no
way of escape from a painful bite probably more than one What Captain
Zelotes had formerly called his Portygee temper flared up

Oh damn you clear out he shouted springing to his feet

From a little way below him in fact from behind the next dune between
himself and the beach a feminine voice called his name

Oh Mr Speranza it said Is it you Im so glad

Albert turned but the moment he did so the dog made a dash at his legs
so he was obliged to turn back again and kick violently

Oh I am so glad it is you said the voice again I was sure it was a
dreadful tramp Googoo loathes tramps

As an article of diet that meant probably Googooif that was the
dogs namewas passionately fond of poets that was selfevident and
intended to make a meal of this one forthwith He flew at the Speranza
ankles Albert performed a most undignified war dance and dashed his
handful of sand into Googoos open countenance For a minute or so there
was a lively shindy on top of that knoll At the end of the minute the
dog held tightly in a pair of feminine arms was emitting growls
and coughs and sand while Madeline Fosdick and Albert Speranza were
kneeling in more sand and looking at each other

Oh did he bite you begged Miss Fosdick

No    no I guess not was the reply II scarcely know yet
   Why when did you come I didnt know you were in town

We came yesterday Motored from home you know Ibe still Goo you
bad thing It was such a lovely day that I couldnt resist going for
a walk along the beach I took Googoo because he does love it so
andGoo be still I tell you I am sure he thinks you are a tramp out
here all alone in thein the wilderness And what were you doing here

Albert drew a long breath I was half asleep I guess he said when
he broke loose at my heels I woke up quick enough then as you may
imagine And so you are here for the summer Your new house isnt
finished is it

No not quite Mother and Goo and I are at the hotel for a month
But you havent answered my question What were you doing off here all
alone Have you been for a walk too

Not exactly Iwell I come here pretty often It is one of my
favorite hiding places You see I    dont laugh if I tell you will
you

Of course not Go on this is very mysterious and interesting

Well I come here sometimes on pleasant days to be aloneand write

Write Write poetry do you mean

Yes

Oh how wonderful Were you writing when Iwhen Goo interrupted you

No I had made two or three attempts but nothing that I did satisfied
me I had just about decided to tear them up and to give up trying for
this afternoon

Oh I hope you wont tear them up Im sure they shouldnt be Perhaps
you were not in a proper mood to judge yourself

Perhaps not Perhaps they might look a little less hopeless to some one
else But that person would have to be really interested and there are
few people in South Harniss who know or care anything about poetry

I suppose that is true II dont suppose you would care to show them
to me would you

Why eagerly would you really care to see them

Indeed I should Not that my judgment or advice is worth anything of
course But I am very very fond of poetry and to see how a real poet
wrote would be wonderful And if I could help you even the least little
bit it would be such an honor

This sort of thing was balm to the Speranza spirit Alberts
temperamental ego expanded under it like a rosebud under a summer sun
Yet there was a faint shadow of doubtshe might be making fun of him
He looked at her intently and she seemed to read his thoughts for she
said

Oh I mean it Please believe I do I havent spoken that way when Jane
was with me for she wouldnt understand and would laugh but I mean it
Mr Speranza It would be an honora great honor

So the still protesting and rebellious Googoo was compelled to go a few
feet away and lie down while his mistress and the young man whom he had
attempted to devour bent their heads together over a scribblingpad
and talked and exclaimed during the whole of that hour and a full
threequarters of the next Then the distant town clock in the steeple
of the Congregational church boomed five times and Miss Fosdick rose to
her feet

Oh she said it cant really be five oclock can it But it is
What WILL mother fancy has become of me I must go this minute Thank
you Mr Speranza I have enjoyed this so much It has been a wonderful
experience

Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were shining She had grown
handsomer than ever during the winter months Alberts eyes were shining
also as he impulsively seized her hand

Thank you Miss Fosdick he said You have helped me more than I
can tell you I was about to give up in despair before you came and
nownow I KNOW I shall write the best thing I have ever done And you
will be responsible for it

She caught her breath Oh not really she exclaimed You dont mean
it really

Indeed I do If I might have your help and sympathy once in awhile I
believeI believe I could do almost anything Will you help me again
some day I shall be here almost every pleasant Saturday and Sunday
afternoon Will you come again

She hesitated IIll see perhaps she answered hurriedly But I
must go now Come Goo

She hastened away down the knoll and along the beach toward the hotel
Googoo followed her turning occasionally to cast diabolical glances at
the Speranza ankles Albert gazed until the graceful figure in the trim
sport costume disappeared behind the corner of the point of the beach
Just at the point she paused to wave to him He waved in return Then
he tramped homeward There was deep sand beneath his feet and later
pineneedles and grass They were all alike to him for he was traveling
on air

That evening at supper his radiant appearance caused comment

What makes you look so happy Albert asked his grandmother Seems to
me I never saw you look so sort ofwell glorified as you might say
What is the reason

The glorified one reddened and was confused He stammered that he did
not know he was not aware of any particular reason

Mrs Ellis beamed upon him I presume likely his bookkeepin at the
office has been goin pretty well lately she suggested

Captain Zelotes gray eyes twinkled Callate hes been makin up more
poetry about girls was his offering Another one of those pieces
about teeth like pearls and hair all curls or somethin like that Say
Al why dont you poetrymakin fellers try a new one once in a while
Say Her hairs like rope and her face has lost hope Eh Why not for
a change

The protests on the part of Olive and the housekeeper against the
captains innovation in poetrymaking had the effect of distracting
attention from Alberts glorified appearance The young man himself
was thankful for the respite

That night before he retired he took Madeline Fosdicks photograph from
the back of the drawer among the ties and collars and looked at it for
five minutes at least She was a handsome girl certainly Not that
that made any difference to him And she was an intelligent girl she
understood his poetry and appreciated it Yes and she understood him
too almost as well as Helen    Helen He hastily returned the
Fosdick photograph to the drawer but this time he did not put it quite
so near the back

On the following Saturday he was early at the knoll a brandnew
scribblingpad in his pocket and in his mind divine gems which
were later and with Miss Fosdicks assistance to be strung into
a glittering necklace of lyric song and draped with the stringers
compliments about the throat of a grateful muse But no gems were
strung that day Madeline did not put in an appearance and by and by
it began to rain and Albert walked home damp dejected and disgusted
When a day or two later he met Miss Fosdick at the post office and
asked why she had not come he learned that her mother had insisted upon
a motor trip to Wapatomac that afternoon

Besides she said you surely mustnt expect me EVERY Saturday

No he admitted grudgingly I suppose not But you will come
sometimes wont you I have a perfectly lovely idea for a ballad and I
want to ask your advice about it

Oh do you really Youre not making fun You mean that my advice is
really worth something I cant believe it

He convinced her that it was and the next Saturday afternoon they spent
together at the inspiration point among the dunes at work upon the
ballad It was not finished on that occasion nor on the next for it
was an unusually long ballad but progress was made glorious progress

And so during that Summer as the Fosdick residence upon the Bay Road
grew and grew so did the acquaintanceship the friendship the poetic
partnership between the Fosdick daughter and the grandson of Captain
Zelotes Snow grow and grow They met almost every Saturday they met at
the post office on week evenings occasionally they saw each other for a
moment after church on Sunday mornings Mrs Fletcher Fosdick could not
imagine why her only child cared to attend that stuffy little country
church and hear that prosy Kendall minister drone on and on I hope
my dear that I am as punctilious in my religious duties as the average
woman but one Kendall sermon was sufficient for me thank you What you
see in THAT church to please you _I_ cant guess

If she had attended as often as Madeline did she might have guessed and
saved herself much But she was busy organizing in connection with
Mrs Seabury Calvin a Literary Society among the summer people of South
Harniss The Society was to begin work with the discussion of the poetry
of Rabindranath Tagore Mrs Fosdick said she doted on Tagore Mrs
Calvin expressed herself as being positively insane about him A
warm friendship had sprung up between the two ladies as each was
particularly fond of shining as a literary light and neither under any
circumstances permitted a new lion to roar unheard in her neighborhood
provided of course that the said roarings had been previously endorsed
and well advertised by the critics and the press

So Mrs Fosdick was too busy to accompany Madeline to church on Sunday
or to walk on Saturday and the young lady was left to wander pretty
much at her own sweet will That sweet will led her footsteps to trails
frequented by Albert Speranza and they walked and talked and poetized
together As for Mr Fletcher Fosdick he was busy at his office in New
York and came to South Harniss only for infrequent weekends

The walks and talks and poetizings were innocent enough Neither of the
partners in poesy had the least idea of anything more than being just
that They liked each other they had come to call each other by their
Christian names and on Alberts bureau Madelines photograph now stood
openly and without apology Albert had convinced himself there was
nothing to apologize for She was his friend that was all He liked to
write and she liked to help himerwell just as Helen used to when
she was at home He did not think of Helen quite as often as formerly
nor were his letters to her as frequent or as long

So the summer passed and late August came the last Saturday afternoon
of that month Albert and Madeline were together walking together along
the beach from the knoll where they had met so often It was six oclock
and the beach was deserted There was little wind the tiny waves were
lapping and plashing along the shore and the rosy light of the sinking
sun lay warm upon the water and the sand They were thinking and
speaking of the summer which was so near its end

It has been a wonderful summer hasnt it said Albert

Yes wonderful agreed Madeline

Yes IIby George I never believed a summer could be so wonderful

Nor I

Silence Then Albert looking at her saw her eyes looking into his and
saw in them

He kissed her

That morning Albert Speranza had arisen as usual a casual careless
perfectly human young fellow He went to bed that night a superman an
archangel a demigod with his head in the clouds and the earth a cloth
of gold beneath his feet Life was a pathway through Paradise arched
with rainbows

He and Madeline Fosdick loved each other madly devotedly They were
engaged to be married They had plighted troth They were to be each
others and no one elses for everand everand ever



CHAPTER X


The remainder of that summer was a paradisical meandering over the cloth
of gold beneath the rainbows Albert and his Madeline met often very
often Few poems were written at these meetings Why trouble to put
penciled lines on paper when the entire universe was a poem especially
composed for your benefit The lovers sat upon the knoll amid the
sand dunes and gazed at the bay and talked of themselves separately
individually and more especially collectively They strolled through
the same woody lanes and discussed the same satisfactory subjects They
met at the post office or at the drug store and gazed into each others
eyes And what was the most astonishing thing about it all their
secret remained undiscovered Undiscovered that is to say by those
by whom discovery would have meant calamity The gossips among the
townspeople winked and chuckled and callated Fletcher Fosdick had
better look out or his girl would be took into the firm of Z Snow and
Co Issachar Price uttered sarcastic and sly innuendoes Jane Kelsey
and her set ragged the pair occasionally But even these never really
suspected that the affair was serious And neither Mrs Fletcher Fosdick
nor Captain and Mrs Zelotes Snow gave it a minutes attention

It was serious enough with the principals however To them it was the
only serious matter in the world Not that they faced or discussed the
future with earnest and complete attention Some day or otherthat was
of course the mutually accepted ideasome day or other they were to
marry In the meantime here was the blissful present with its roses
and rainbows and here for each was the other What would be likely to
happen when the Fosdick parents learned of the engagement of their
only child to the assistant bookkeeper of the South Harniss lumber and
hardware company was unpleasant to contemplate so why contemplate it
Upon one point they were agreednever never NEVER would they
give each other up No power on earthwhich included parents and
grandparentsshould or could separate them

Alberts conscience troubled him slightly at first when he thought of
Helen Kendall It had been in reality such a short timealthough of
course it seemed ages and agessince he had fancied himself in love
with her Only the previous fallyes even that very spring he
had asked her to pledge herself to him Fortunatelyoh how very
fortunatelyshe had refused and he had been left free Now he knew
that his fancied love for her had been merely a passing whim a delusion
of the moment ThisTHIS which he was now experiencing was the grand
passion of his life He wrote a poem with the title The Greater
Loveand sold it too to a sensational periodical which circulated
largely among sentimental shopgirls It is but truthful to state that
the editor of the magazine to which he first submitted it sent it back
with the brief noteThis is a trifle too syrupy for our use Fear the
pages might stick Why not send us another war verse Albert treated
the note and the editor with the contempt they deserved He pitied the
latter poor soul doubtless HE had never known the greater love

He and Madeline had agreed that they would tell no oneno one at
allof their betrothal It should be their own precious secret for the
present So under the circumstances he could not write Helen the
news But ought he to write her at all That question bothered him not
a little He no longer loved herin fact he was now certain that he
never had loved herbut he liked her and he wanted her to keep on
liking him And she wrote to him with regularity What ought he to do
about writing her

He debated the question with himself and at last and with some
trepidation asked Madelines opinion of his duty in the matter Her
opinion was decisive and promptly given Of course he must not write
Helen again How would you like it if I corresponded with another
fellow she asked Candor forced him to admit that he should not like
it at all But I want to behave decently he said She is merely a
friend of mineoh how short is memorybut we have been friends for
a long time and I wouldnt want to hurt her feelings No instead
you prefer to hurt mine Now dearest be reasonable It was their
nearest approach to a quarrel and was a very very sad affair
The makingup was sweet of course but the question of further
correspondence with Helen Kendall remained just where it was at the
beginning And meanwhile the correspondence lapsed

September came far far too sooncame and ended And with it ended
also the stay of the Fosdicks in South Harniss Albert and Madeline said
goodby at their rendezvous by the beach It was a sad a tearful but
a very precious farewell They would write each other every day they
would think of each other every minute of every day they would live
through the winter somehow and look forward to the next spring and their
next meeting

You will writeoh ever and ever so many poems wont you dear
begged Madeline You know how I love them And whenever I see one of
your poems in print I shall be so proud of youof MY poet

Albert promised to write ever and ever so many He felt that there would
be no difficulty in writing reams of poemsinspired glorious poems
The difficulty would be in restraining himself from writing too many
of them With Madeline Fosdick as an inspiration poetizing became as
natural as breathing

Then which was unusual for them they spoke of the future the dim
vague but so happy future when Albert was to be the nations poet
laureate and Madeline as Mrs Laureate would share his glory and
wear so to speak his secondbest laurels The disagreeable problems
connected with the future they ignored or casually dismissed with
Never mind dear it will be all right by and by Oh it was a
wonderful afternoon a rosy cloudy happy sorrowful bittersweet
afternoon

And the next morning Albert peeping beneath Z Snow and Cos office
window shade saw his hearts desire step aboard the train saw that
train puff out of the station saw for just an instant a small hand
waved behind the dingy glass of the car window His own hand waved in
reply Then the raucous voice of Mr Price broke the silence

Who was you flappin your flipper at inquired Issachar Girl Ill
bet you Never saw such a critter as you be to chase after the girls
Which one is it this time

Albert made no reply Between embarrassment and sorrow he was incapable
of speech Issachar however was not in that condition at all times
when awake and sometimes when asleep Mr Price could and usually did
speak

Which one is it this time Al demanded Issy Eh Crimus see him get
red Haw haw Labe to Mr Keeler who came into the office from the
inner room which girl do you callate Al here is wavin bybye to this
mornin Whos goin away on the cars this mornin Labe

Laban his hands full of the morning mail absently replied that he
didnt know

Yes you do too persisted Issy You aint listenin thats all
Whos leavin town on the train just now

Eh Oh I dont know The Small folks are goin to Boston I believe
And George Bartletts goin to Ostable on court business he told me
Oh yes I believe Capn Lote said that Fosdick woman and her daughter
were goin back to New York Back to New Yorkyesyesyes

Mr Price crowed triumphantly Ah ha he crowed Ah ha Thats the
answer Thats the one hes shakin daydays to that Fosdick girl Ive
seen you round with her at the post office and the ice cream sloon
Im onto you Al Haw haw Whats her name Adeline Dandelion
Madelinethats it Say how do you think Helen Kendalls goin to
like your throwin kisses to the Madeline one eh

The assistant bookkeeper was still silent The crimson however was
leaving his face and the said face was paling rapidly This was an
ominous sign had Mr Price but known it He did not know it and cackled
merrily on

Guess Ill have to tell Helen when she comes back home he announced
Callate Ill put a flea in her ear Helen Ill say dont feel
too bad now dont cry and get your handkerchief all soakin or nothin
like that I just feel its my duty to tell ye that your little Albert
is sparkin up to somebody else Hes waitin on a party by the name of
Padelineno MadelineWoodtickno Fosdickand    Here let go
of me What are you doin

That last question was in the nature of a gurgle Albert his face now
very white indeed had strode across the office seized the speaker by
the front of his flannel shirt and backed him against the wall

Stop commanded Albert between his teeth Thats enough of that
Dont you say any more

Eh Ugh Urgg Leggo of my shirt

Albert let go but he did not step back He remained where he was
exactly in front of Mr Price

Dont you say any more aboutabout what you were saying he repeated

Eh Not say any more Why not Whos goin to stop me Id like to
know

I am

I want to know Whatll you do

I dont know If you werent so old I wouldbut Ill stop you
anyhow

Albert felt a hand on his arm and heard Mr Keelers voice at his ear

Careful Al careful it said Dont hit him

Of course I shant hit him indignantly What do you think I am But
he must promise not to mentionerMiss Fosdicks name again

Better promise Is suggested Laban Issachars mouth opened but no
promise came forth

Promise be darned he yelled furiously Mention her name Ill
mention any name I set out to and no Italyun Portygee is goin to stop
me neither

Albert glanced about the office By the wall stood two brimming pails of
water brought in by Mr Price for floorwashing purposes He lifted one
of the pails

If you dont promise Ill duck you he declared Let go of me
Keeler I mean it

Careful Al careful said Mr Keeler Better promise Is

Promise nawthin Fosdick What in time do I care for Fosdicks
Madelines or Padelines or Dandelions or

His sentence stopped just there The remainder of it was washed back
and down his throat by the deluge from the bucket Overcome by shock and
surprise Mr Price leaned back against the wall and slid slowly down
that wall until he reclined in a sitting posture upon the floor

Crimustee he gasped as soon as he could articulate ImawkIm
drownded

Albert put down the empty bucket and picked up the full one

Promise he said again

Laban Keeler rubbed his chin

Id promise if I was you Is he said Youre some subject to
rheumatism you know

Issachar sitting in a spreading puddle looked damply upward at the
remaining bucket By crimustee he began Albert drew the bucket
backward the water dripped from its lower brim

IIdarn ye I promise shouted Issachar Albert put down the bucket
and walked back to his desk Laban watched him curiously smiling just a
little Then he turned to Mr Price who was scrambling to his feet

Better get your mop and swab up here Is he said Capn Lotell be
in most any minute

When Captain Zelotes did return to the office Issachar was
industriously sweeping out Albert was hard at work at the books and
Laban was still rubbing his chin and smiling at nothing in particular

The next day Albert and Issachar made it up Albert apologized

Im sorry Issy he said I shouldnt have done it but you made me
mad I have arather mean temper Im afraid Forgive me will you

He held out his hand and Issachar after a momentary hesitation took
it

I forgive you this time Al he said solemnly but dont never do
nothin like it again will ye When I went home for dinner yesterday
noon I give you my word my clothes was kind of dampish even then If
it hadnt been nice warm sunshine and I was out doors and dried off
considerable Id a had to change everything underclothes and all and
taint but the middle of the week yet

His ducking had an effect which Albert noticed with considerable
satisfactionhe was never quite as flippantly personal in his comments
concerning the assistant bookkeeper He treated the latter if not with
respect at least with something distantly akin to it

After Madelines departure the world was very lonely indeed Albert
wrote long long letters and received replies which varied in length
but never in devotion Miss Fosdick was obliged to be cautious in her
correspondence with her lover You will forgive me if this is not much
more than a note wont you dear she wrote Mother seems to be very
curious of late about my letters and to whom I write and I had to just
steal the opportunity this morning An older and more apprehensive
person might have found Mrs Fosdicks sudden interest in her daughters
correspondence suspicious and a trifle alarming but Albert never
dreamed of being alarmed

He wrote many poems all dealing with love and lovers and sold some of
them He wrote no more letters to Helen She too had ceased to write
him doubtless because of the lack of reply to her last two or three
letters His conscience still troubled him about Helen he could not
help feeling that his treatment of her had not been exactly honorable
Yet what else under the circumstances could he do From Mr Kendall he
learned that she was coming home to spend Thanksgiving He would see her
then She would ask him questions What should his answer be He faced
the situation in anticipation many many times usually after he had
gone to bed at night and lay awake through long torturing hours in
consequence

But when at last Helen and he did meet the day before Thanksgiving
their meeting was not at all the dreadful ordeal he had feared Her
greeting was as frank and cordial as it had always been and there was
no reproach in her tone or manner She did not even ask him why he had
stopped writing It was he himself who referred to that subject
and he did so as they walked together down the main road Just why he
referred to it he could not probably have told He was aware only that
he felt mean and contemptible and that he must offer some explanation
His not having any to offer made the task rather difficult

But she saved him the trouble She interrupted one of his blundering
stumbling sentences in the middle

Never mind Albert she said quietly You neednt explain I think I
understand

He stopped and stared at her You understand he repeated Whywhy
no you dont You cant

Yes I can or I think I can You have changed your mind that is all

Changed my mind

Yes Dont you remember I told you you would change your mind
aboutwell about me You were so sure you cared so very very much for
me you know And I said you mustnt promise anything because I thought
you would change your mind And you have That is it isnt it You have
found some one else

He gazed at her as if she were a witch who had performed a miracle

Whywhywell by George he exclaimed Helenhowhow did you
know Who told you

No one told me But I think I can even guess who it is you have found
It is Madeline Fosdick isnt it

His amazement now was so openmouthed as well as openeyed that she
could not help smiling

Dont Dont stare at me like that she whispered Every one is
looking at you There is old Captain Pease on the other side of the
street Im sure he thinks you have had a stroke or something Here
Walk down our road a little way toward home with me We can talk as we
walk Im sure she added with just the least bit of change in her
tone that your Madeline wont object to our being together to that
extent

She led the way down the side street toward the parsonage and he
followed her He was still speechless from surprise

Well she went on after a moment arent you going to say anything

Butbut Helen he faltered how did you know

She smiled again Then it IS Madeline she said I thought it must
be

Youyou thoughtWhat made you think so

For an instant she seemed on the point of losing her patience

Then she turned and laid her hand on his arm

Oh Al she said please dont think I am altogether an idiot
I surmised when your letters began to grow shorter andwell
differentthat there was something or some one who was changing them
and I suspected it was some one When you stopped writing altogether I
KNEW there must be Then father wrote in his letters about you and about
meeting you and so often Madeline Fosdick was wherever he met you So I
guessedand you see I guessed right

He seized her hand

Oh Helen he cried if you only knew how mean I have felt and how
ashamed I am of the way I have treated you But you see II COULDNT
write you and tell you because we had agreed to keep it a secret I
couldnt tell ANY ONE

Oh it is as serious as that Are you two really and truly engaged

Yes There Ive told it and I swore I would never tell

No no you didnt tell I guessed Now tell me all about her She is
very lovely Is she as sweet as she looks

He rhapsodized for five minutes Then all at once he realized what he
was saying and to whom he was saying it He stopped stammering in the
very middle of a glowing eulogium

Go on said Helen reassuringly But he could not go on under the
circumstances Instead he turned very red As usual she divined his
thought noticed his confusion and took pity on it

She must be awfully nice she said I dont wonder you fell in love
with her I wish I might know her better

I wish you might By and by you must And she must know you Helen
II feel so ashamed ofof

Hush or I shall begin to think you are ashamed because you liked
meor thought you did

But I do like you Next to Madeline there is no one I like so much
But but you see it is different

Of course it is And it ought to be Does her motherdo her people
know of the engagement

He hesitated momentarily Noo he admitted they dont yet She and
I have decided to keep it a secret from any one for the present I want
to get on a little further with my writing you know She is like you in
that Helenshes awfully fond of poetry and literature

Especially yours Im sure Tell me about your writing How are you
getting on

So he told her and until they stood together at the parsonage gate
Madelines name was not again mentioned Then Helen put out her hand

Good morning Albert she said Im glad we have had this talk ever
so glad

By George so am I Youre a corking friend Helen The chap who does
marry you will be awfully lucky

She smiled slightly Perhaps there wont be any such chap she said
I shall always be a schoolmarm I imagine

Indeed you wont indignantly I have too high an opinion of men for
that

She smiled again seemed about to speak and then to change her mind An
instant later she said

I must go in now But I shall hope to see you again before I go back to
the city And after your secret is out and the engagement is announced
I want to write Madeline may I

Of course you may And shell like you as much as I do

Will she    Well perhaps well hope so

Certainly she will And you wont let my treating you asas I have
make any difference in our friendship

No We shall always be friends I hope Goodby

She went into the house He waited a moment hoping she might turn again
before entering but she did not He walked home pondering deeply his
thoughts a curious jumble of relief and dissatisfaction He was glad
Helen had seen her duty and given him over to Madeline but he felt a
trifle piqued to think she had done it with such apparent willingness
If she had wept or scolded it would have been unpleasant but much more
gratifying to his selfimportance

He could not help realizing however that her attitude toward him was
exceptionally fine He knew well that he if in her place would not
have behaved as she had done No spite no sarcasm no taunts no
unpleasant reminders of things said only a few months before And with
all her forgiveness and forbearance and understanding there had been
always that sense of greater age and wisdom she had treated him as she
might have treated a boy younger brother perhaps

She IS older than I am he thought even if she really isnt Its
funny but its a fact

December came and Christmas and then January and the new year the year
1917 In January Z Snow and Co took its yearly account of stock and
Captain Lote and Laban and Albert and Issachar were truly busy during
the days of stocktaking week and tired when evening came Laban worked
the hardest of the quartette but Issy made the most fuss about it
Labe who had chosen the holiday season to go on one of his periodical
vacations as rather white and shaky and even more silent than usual
Mr Price however talked with his customary fluency and continuity so
there was no lack of conversation Captain Zelotes was moved to comment

Issy he suggested gravely looking up from a long column of figures
did you ever play Door

Issachar stared at him

Play Door he repeated Whats that

Its a game Didnt you ever play it

No dont knows I ever did

Then youd better begin right this minute The first thing to do is to
shut up and the next is to stay that way You play Door until I tell
you to do somethin else dyou hear

At home the week between Christmas and the New Year was rather dismal
Mr Keelers holiday vacation had brought on one of his fiancees
sympathetic attacks and she tied up her head and hung crape upon
her soul as usual During these attacks the Snow household walked on
tiptoe as if the housekeeper were an invalid in reality Even consoling
speeches from Albert who with Laban when the latter was sober enjoyed
in her mind the distinction of being the reincarnation of Robert
Penfold brought no relief to the suffering Rachel Nothing but the
news brought by the milkman that Labe was taperin off and would
probably return to his desk in a few days eased her pain

One forenoon about the middle of the month Captain Zelotes himself
stopped in at the post office for the morning mail When he returned to
the lumber companys building he entered quietly and walked to his own
desk with a preoccupied air For the half hour before dinner time he sat
there smoking his pipe and speaking to no one unless spoken to The
office force noticed his preoccupation and commented upon it

What ails the old man Al whispered Issachar peering in around the
corner of the door at the silent figure tilted back in the revolving
chair its feet upon the corner of the desk Aint said so much as
Boo for upards of twenty minutes has he I was in there just now
fillin up his inkstand and by crimus I let a great big gob of ink
come down kersouse right in the middle of the nice clean blottin
paper in front of him I held my breath callatin to catch what
Stephen Peter used to say he caught when he went fishin Sundays Stevey
said he generally caught cold when he went and always caught the Old
Harry when he got back I callated to catch the Old Harry part sure
cause Captain Lote is always neat and fussy bout his desk But no the
old man never said a word I dont believe he knew the ink was spilled
at all Whats on his mind Al do you know

Albert did not know so he asked Laban Laban shook his head

Give it up Al he whispered Somethins happened to bother him
thats sartin When Capn Lote gets his feet propped up and his head
tilted back that way I can most generally callate hes doin some real
thinkin Real thinkinyes sireeumhmyesyes When he hists
his boots up to the masthead that way its safe to figger his brains
have got steam up Umhmyes indeed

But what is he thinking about And why is he so quiet

I give up both riddles Al Hes the only ones got the answers and
when he gets ready enough maybe hell tell em Until then itll pay us
fomast hands to make believe were busy even if we aint Hear that
do you Is

Hear what demanded Issachar who was gazing out of the window his
hands in his pockets

I say it will pay usyou and Al and meto make believe were workin
even if we aint

Workin indignantly By crimus I AM workin I dont have to make
believe

That so Well then Id pick up that coalhod and make believe
play for a spell The fires most out Almostumhmpretty
nighyesyes

Albert and his grandfather walked home to dinner together as was their
custom but still the captain remained silent During dinner he spoke
not more than a dozen words and Albert several times caught Mrs Snow
regarding her husband intently and with a rather anxious look She did
not question him however but Rachel was not so reticent

Mercy on us Capn Lote she demanded what IS the matter Youre as
dumb as a mouthful of mush I dont believe youve said ay yes or no
since we sat down to table Are you sick

Her employers calm was unruffled

Noo he answered with deliberation

Thats a comfort Whats the matter then dont you WANT to talk

Noo

Oh with a toss of the head well Im glad I know I was beginnin
to be afraid youd forgotten how

The captain helped himself to another fried tinker mackerel

No danger of that around here Rachel he said serenely So long as
my hearins good I couldnt forgetnot in this house

Olive detained her grandson as he was following Captain Zelotes from the
dining room

Whats wrong with him Albert she whispered Do you know

No I dont Grandmother Do you think there is anything wrong

I know theres somethin troublin him Ive lived with him too many
years not to know the signs Oh Albertyou havent done anything to
displease him have you

No indeed Grandmother Whatever it is it isnt that

When they reached the office the captain spoke to Mr Keeler

Had your dinner Labe he asked

Yesyes indeed Dont take me long to eatnot at my boardin house
A fellerd have to have paralysis to make eatin one of Lindy Dadgetts
meals take moren a half hour Umhmyes

Despite his preoccupation Captain Zelotes could not help smiling

To make it take an hour hed have to be ossified wouldnt he like the
feller in the circus sideshow he observed

Laban nodded Thator dead he replied Yesjust aboutjust so
Capn

Wheres Issachar

Hes eatin yet I callate He dont board at Lindys

When he gets back set him to pilin that new carload of spruce under
Number Three shed Keep him at it

Yes sir Umhm All right

Captain Zelotes turned to his grandson Come in here Al he said I
want to see you for a few minutes

Albert followed him into the inner office He wondered what in the world
his grandfather wished to see him about in this very private fashion

Sit down Al said the captain taking his own chair and pointing to
another Oh wait a minute though Maybe youd better shut that hatch
first

The hatch was the transom over the door between the offices Albert
remembering how a previous interview between them had been overheard
because of that open transom glanced at his grandfather The twinkle
in the latters eye showed that he too remembered Albert closed the
hatch When he came back to his seat the twinkle had disappeared
Captain Zelotes looked serious enough

Well Grandfather queried the young man after waiting a moment The
captain adjusted his spectacles reached into the inside pocket of his
coat and produced an envelope It was a square envelope with either
a trademark or a crest upon the back Captain Lote did not open the
envelope but instead tapped his desk with it and regarded his grandson
in a meditative way

Al he said slowly has it seemed to you that your cruise aboard this
craft of ours here had been a little smoother the last year or two than
it used to be afore that

Albert by this time well accustomed to his grandfathers nautical
phraseology understood that the cruise referred to was his voyage as
assistant bookkeeper with Z Snow and Co He nodded

I have tried to make it so he answered I mean I have tried to make
it smoother for you

Umhm I think you have tried I dont mind tellin you that it has
pleased me considble to watch you try I dont mean by that he
added with a slight curve of the lip that youd win first prize as
a lightnincalculator even yet but youre a whole lot better one than
you used to be Ive been considerable encouraged about you I dont
mind tellin you that either    And he added after another
interval during which he was apparently debating just how much of
an admission it was safe to make so far as I can see this poetry
foolishness of yours hasnt interfered with your work any to speak of

Albert smiled Thanks Grandfather he said

Youre welcome So much for that But theres another side to our
relations together yours and mine that I havent spoken of to you
afore And I have kept still on purpose Ive figgered that so long as
you kept straight and didnt go off the course didnt drink or gamble
or go wild or the like of that what you did was pretty much your own
business Ive noticed youre considerable of a feller with the girls
but I kept an eye on the kind of girls and I will say that so far as I
can see youve picked the decent kind I say so far as I can see Of
course I aint fool enough to believe I see all you do or know all you
do Ive been young myself and when I get to thinkin how much I know
about you I try to set down and remember how much my dad didnt know
about me when I was your age Thaterhelps some toward givin me my
correct position on the chart

He paused Alberts brain was vainly striving to guess what all
this meant What was he driving at The captain crossed his legs and
continued

I did think for a spell he said that you and Helen Kendall were
gettin to understand each other pretty well Well Helens a good girl
and your grandma and I like her Course we didnt callate anything
very serious was liable to come of the understandin not for some time
anyhow for with your salary andwell sort of unsettled prospects I
gave you credit for not figgerin on pickin a wife right away   
Havent got much laid by to support a wife on have you Al

Alberts expression had changed during the latter portion of the speech
Now he was gazing intently at his grandfather and at the letter in the
latters hands He was beginning to guess to dread to be fearful

Havent got much to support a wife on Al have you repeated Captain
Zelotes

No sir not now

Um    But you hope to have by and by eh Well I hope you will
But UNTIL you have it would seem to older folks like me kind of risky
navigatin toto    Oh there was a letter in the mail for you this
mornin Al

He put down the envelope he had hitherto held in his hand and reaching
into his pocket produced another Even before he had taken it from
his grandfathers hand Albert recognized the handwriting It was from
Madeline

Captain Zelotes regarding him keenly leaned back again in his chair
Read it if you want to Al he said Maybe youd better I can wait

Albert hesitated a moment and then tore open the envelope The note
within was short evidently written in great haste and agitation and
was spotted with tear stains He read it his cheeks paling and his
hand shaking as he did so Something dreadful had happened MotherMrs
Fosdick of coursehad discovered everything She had found all
hisAlbertsletters and read them She was furious There had been
the most terrible scene Madeline was in her own room and was smuggling
him this letter by Mary her maid who will do anything for me and
has promised to mail it Oh dearest they say I must give you up They
sayOh they say dreadful things about you Mother declares she will
take me to Japan or some frightful place and keep me there until I
forget you I dont care if they take me to the ends of the earth I
shall NEVER forget you I will neverneverNEVER give you up And you
mustnt give me up will you darling They say I must never write you
again But you see I haveand I shall Oh what SHALL we do I was SO
happy and now I am so miserable Write me the minute you get this but
oh I KNOW they wont let me see your letters and then I shall die But
write write just the same every day Oh what SHALL we do

Yours always and always no matter what everyone does or says lovingly
and devotedly

MADELINE


When the reading was finished Albert sat silently staring at the floor
seeing it through a wet mist Captain Zelotes watched him his heavy
brows drawn together and the smoke wreaths from his pipe curling slowly
upward toward the office ceiling At length he said

Well Al I had a letter too I presume likely it came from the same
port even if not from the same member of the family Its about you
and I think youd better read it maybe Ill read it to you if youd
rather

Albert shook his head and held out his hand for the second letter His
grandfather gave it to him saying as he did so Id like to have you
understand Al that I dont necessarily believe all that she says about
you in this thing

Thanks Grandfather mechanically

All right boy

The second letter was as he had surmised from Mrs Fosdick It had
evidently been written at top speed and at a mental temperature well
above the boiling point Mrs Fosdick addressed Captain Zelotes Snow
because she had been given to understand that he was the nearest
relative or guardian or whatever it was of the person concerning whom
the letter was written and therefore it was presumed might be expected
to have some measure of control over that persons actions The person
was of course one Albert Speranza and Mrs Fosdick proceeded to set
forth her version of his conduct in sentences which might almost have
blistered the paper Taking advantage of her trust in her daughters
good sense and ability to take care of herselfwhich trust it
appeared had been in a measure misplacedhe the Speranza person had
sneakingly underhandedly and in a despicably clandestine fashionthe
ladys temper had rather gotten away from her heresucceeded in meeting
her daughter in various places and by various disgraceful means and had
furthermore succeeded in ensnaring her youthful affections et cetera
et cetera


The poor child actually believes herself in love with him wrote the
poor childs mother She protests ridiculously that she is engaged to
him and will marry him in spite of her father or myself or the protests
of sensible people I write to you therefore assuming you likewise to
be a sensible person and requesting that you use your influence with
theto put the most charitable interpretation of his conductmisguided
and foolish young man and show him the preposterous folly of his
pretended engagement to my daughter Of course the whole affair
CORRESPONDENCE INCLUDED must cease and terminate AT ONCE


And so on for two more pages The color had returned to Alberts cheeks
long before he finished reading When he had finished he rose to his
feet and throwing the letter upon his grandfathers desk turned away

Well Al queried Captain Zelotes

Alberts face when he turned back to answer was whiter than ever but
his eyes flashed fire

Do you believe that he demanded

What

Thatthat stuff about my being aa sneak andand ensnaring herand
all the rest Do you

The captain took his pipe from his mouth

Steady son steady he said Didnt I tell you before you begun
to read at all that I didnt necessarily believe it because that woman
wrote it

Youyou or no one else had better believe it Its a lie

All right Im glad to hear you say so But theres a little mite of
truth here and there amongst the lies I presume likely For instance
you and this Fosdick girl have beenerkeepin company

Her name is Madelineand we are engaged to be married

Oh HumI seeI see And bein as the old ladyher mother Mrs
Fosdick I meanhasnt suspected anything or at any rate hasnt
found out anything until now yesterday or whenever it was I judge you
have been meetinerMadeline at places where there wasntwell too
large a crowd Eh

Albert hesitated and was momentarily a trifle embarrassed But he
recovered at once

I met her first at the drug store last summer he said defiantly
Then I met her after that at the post office and at the hotel dance
last fall and so on This year I met herwell I met her first down by
the beach where I went to write She liked poetry andand she helped
me with mine After that she camewell she came to help me again And
after thatafter that

After that it just moved along kind of natural eh Umhm I see

Look here Grandfather I want you to understand that she isisby
George she is the cleanest finest best girl in the world Dont you
get the idea thatthat she isnt She came to meet me just because she
was interested in my verse and wanted to help It wasnt until the very
last that wethat we found out we cared for each other

All right boy all right Go on tell me the whole yarn if you feel
like it I dont want to pry too much into your affairs but after all
I AM interested in those affairs Al Tell me as much as you can

Ill tell you the whole Theres nothing I cant tell nothing Im not
proud to tell By George I ought to be proud Why Grandfather shes
wonderful

Sartin son sartin They always are I mean she is of course Heave
ahead

So Albert told his love story When he had finished Captain Zelotes
pipe was empty and he put it down

Albert he said slowly I judge you mean this thing seriously You
mean to marry her some day

Yes indeed I do And I wont give her up either Her motherwhy
what right has her mother got to sayto treat her in this way Or to
call me what she calls me in that letter Why by George

Easy son As I understand it this Madeline of yours is the only child
the Fosdicks have got and when our only child is in danger of bein
carried off by somebody elsewhy well their mothers and fathers are
liable to be just a little upset especially if it comes on em sudden
   Nobody knows that better than I do he added slowly

Albert recognized the allusion but he was not in the mood to be
affected by it He was not just then ready to make allowances for any
one particularly the parental Fosdicks

They have no business to be upsetnot like that anyhow he declared
What does that woman know about me What right has she to say that I
ensnared Madelines affection and all that rot Madeline and I fell in
love with each other just as other people have I suppose

You suppose right observed Captain Zelotes dryly Other people
havea good many of em since Adams time

Well then And what right has she to give orders that I stop
writing or seeing Madelineall that idiotic stuff about ceasing
and terminating at once Sheshe His agitation was making him
incoherentShe talks like Lord Somebodyorother in an oldfashioned
novel or play or something Those old fools were always rejecting
undesirable suitors and ordering their daughters to do this and that
breaking their hearts and so on But that sort of thing doesnt go
nowadays Young people have their own ideas

Umhm Al so Ive noticed

Yes indeed they have Now if Madeline wants to marry me and I want to
marry her who will stop us

The captain pulled at his beard

Why nobody Al as I know of he said provided you both keep on
wantin to marry each other long enough

Keep on wanting long enough What do you mean by that

Why nothin much perhaps only gettin married isnt all just goin
to the parson After the ceremony the rent begins and the grocers bills
and the butchers and the bakers and a thousand or so more Somebodys
got to pay em and the moneys got to come from somewhere Your wages
here Al poetry counted in aint so very big yet Better wait a spell
before you settle down to married life hadnt you

Wellwell II didnt say we were to be married right away
Grandfather She and I arent unreasonable Im doing better and better
with my writings Some day Ill make enough and more Why not

There was enough of the Speranza egotism in this confident assurance to
bring the twinkle to the captains eye He twisted his beard between his
finger and thumb and regarded his grandson mildly

Have you any idea how much enough is liable to be Al he inquired
I dont know the facts about em of course but from what I have heard
I judge the Fosdicks have got plenty of cash Ive heard it estimated
around town from one million to fifty millions Allowin its only one
million it seems likely that yourerwhatshernameMadeline has
been used to havin as much as fifty cents to spend whenever she wanted
it Do you callate to be able to earn enough makin up poetry to keep
her the way her folks have been doin

No of course notnot at first

Oh but later onwhen the market price of poetry has gone upyou can
eh

Look here Grandfather if youre making fun of me I tell you I wont
stand it This is serious I mean it Madeline and I are going to be
married some time and no one can stop us

All right son all right But it did seem to me that in the light of
this letter fromeryour motherinlaw thats goin to be we ought
to face the situation moderately square anyhow First comes marriage
Well thats easy any fool can get married lots of em do But then
as I said comes supportin yourself and wifebills bills and more
bills Youll say that you and she will economize and fight it out
together Fine firstrate but later on there may be more of you a
child children perhaps

Grandfather

Its possible son Such things do happen and they cost money More
mouths to feed Now I take it for granted that you arent marryin the
Fosdick girl for her money

The interruption was prompt and made with fiery indignation

I never thought of her money declared Albert I dont even know that
she has any If she has I dont want it I wouldnt take it She is all
I want

Captain Zelotes lip twitched

Judgin from the tone of her mas last letter to me he observed she
is all you would be liable to get It dont read as if manyerweddin
presents from the brides folks would come along with her But there
there Al dont get mad I know this is a long ways from bein a joke to
you and in a way its no joke for me Course I had realized that some
day youd be figgerin maybe on gettin married but I did hope the
figgerin wouldnt begin for some years yet And when you did I rather
hopedwell II hoped    However we wont stop to bother with
that now Lets stick to this letter of Mrs Fosdicks here I must
answer that I suppose whether I want to or not today Well Al
you tell me I understand that there has been nothin underhand in your
acquaintance with her daughter Other than keepin the engagement a
secret that is

Yes I do

And you mean to stick by your guns and    Well what is it Come
in

There had been a knock upon the office door In answer to his employers
summons Mr Keeler appeared He held a card in his hand

Sorry to disturb you Capn Lote he said Yes I be yes sir But
I judged maybe twas somethin important about the lumber for his
house and he seemed anxious to see you so I took the risk and knocked
Umhmyes yes yes

Captain Zelotes looked at the card Then he adjusted his spectacles and
looked again

Humph he grunted Humph    Weell Labe I guess likely you
might show him in here Wait just a minute before you do it though
Ill open the door when I want him to come

All right Capn Lote Yes yes observed Mr Keeler and departed The
captain looked thoughtfully at the card

Al he said after a moments reflection well have to cut this
talk of ours short for a little spell You go back to your desk and wait
there until I call you Hold on as his grandson moved toward the door
of the outer office Dont go that way Go out through the side door
into the yard and come in the front way Theresertheres a man
waitin to see me anderperhaps hed better not see you first

Albert stared at him uncomprehendingly

Better not see ME he repeated Why shouldnt he see me

Captain Zelotes handed the card to Albert

Better let me talk with him first Al he said You can have your
chance later on

The card bore the name of Mr Fletcher Story Fosdick



CHAPTER XI


Albert read the name on the card He was too astonished to speak Her
father He was here He

His grandfather spoke again and his tone was brisk and businesslike

Go on Al he ordered Out through this side door and around to the
front Lively son lively

But the young mans wits were returning He scowled at the card

No he said stoutly Im not going to run away Im not afraid of
him I havent done anything to be ashamed of

The captain nodded If you had I should ASK you to run away he said
As it is I just ask you to step out and wait a little while thats
all

But Grandfather I WANT to see him

All right I want you tobut not until he and I have talked first
Come boy come Ive lived a little longer than you have and maybe I
know about half as much about some things This is one of em You clear
out and stand by Ill call you when I want you

Albert went but reluctantly After he had gone his grandfather walked
to the door of the outer office and opened it

Step aboard Mr Fosdick he said Come in sir

Mr Fletcher Fosdick was a large man portly and with a head which was
rapidly losing its thatch His smootshaven face was ruddy and his blue
eye mild He entered the private office of Z Snow and Co and shook the
hand which Captain Zelotes proffered

How do you do Captain Snow he asked pleasantly You and I have had
some business dealings but we have never met before I believe

The captain waved toward a chair Thats a fact Mr Fosdick he said
I dont believe we ever have but its better late than by and by as
the feller said Sit down sit down Mr Fosdick Throw off your coat
wont you Its sort of warm in here compared to out door

The visitor admitted the difference in temperature between the interior
and exterior of the building and removed his overcoat Also he sat
down Captain Zelotes opened a drawer of his desk and produced a box of
cigars

Have a smoke wont you he inquired

Mr Fosdick glanced at the label on the box

Whywhy I was rather hoping you would smoke one of mine he said I
have a pocket full

When I come callin on you at your place in New York I will smoke
yours Now it kind of looks to me as if youd ought to smoke mine Seems
reasonable when you think it over dont it

Fosdick smiled Perhaps youre right he said He took one of the
gaudily banded perfectos from his hosts box and accepted a light from
the match the captain held Both men blew a cloud of smoke and through
those clouds each looked at the other The preliminaries were over but
neither seemed particularly anxious to begin the real conversation It
was the visitor who at last began it

Captain Snow he said I presume your clerk told you I wished to see
you on a matter of business

Who Oh Labe you mean Yes he told me

I told him to tell you that It may surprise you however to learn
that the business I wished to see you aboutthat I came on from New
York to see you abouthas nothing whatever to do with the house Im
building down here

Captain Zelotes removed his cigar from his lips and looked meditatively
at its burning end Noo he said slowly that dont surprise me very
much I callated twasnt about the house you wished to see me

Oh I see    Humph The Fosdick mild blue eye lost for the
moment just a trifle of its mildness and became almost keen as its
owner flashed a glance at the big figure seated at the desk I see
said Mr Fosdick And have youerguessed what I did come to see you
about

Noo I wouldnt call it guessin exactly

Wouldnt you What would you call it

Well I dont know but Id risk callin it knowin Yes I think
likely I would

Oh I see    Humph Have you had a letteron the subject

Yees

I see From Mrs Fosdick of course She said she was going to
writeIm not sure she didnt say she had written but I had the
impression it was towell to another member of your family Captain
Snow

No twas to me Come this mornins mail

I see My mistake Well Im obliged to her in a way If the news has
been broken to you I shant have to break it and we can get down to
brass tacks just so much sooner The surprise being overI take it it
WAS a surprise Captain

You take it right Just as much of a surprise to me as you

Of course Well the surprise being over for both of us we can talk of
the affaircalmly and coolly What do you think about it Captain

Oh I dont know as I know exactly what to think What do YOU think
about it Mr Fosdick

I thinkI imagine I think very much as you do

I shouldnt be surprised Anderwhats your notion of what I think

Captain Zelotes gray eye twinkled as he asked the question and the
Fosdick blue eye twinkled in return Both men laughed

We arent getting very far this way Captain observed the visitor
Theres no use dodging I suppose I for one am not very well
pleased Mrs Fosdick for another isnt pleased at all she is
absolutely and entirely opposed to the whole affair She wont hear of
it thats all and she said so much that I thought perhaps I had better
come down here at once see you andand the young fellow with the
queer name

My grandson

Why yes He is your grandson isnt he I beg your pardon

Thats all right I shant fight with you because you dont like his
name Go ahead You decided to come and see himand me

Yes I did I decided to come because it has been my experience that
a frank straight talk is better in cases like this than a hundred
letters And that the time to talk was now before matters between the
young foothe young people went any further Dont you agree with me

Captain Zelotes nodded

That now is a good time to talk Yes I do he said

Good Then suppose we talk

All right

There was another interval of silence Then Fosdick broke it with a
chuckle And Im the one to do the talking eh he said

Captain Lotes eye twinkled Well you came all the way from New
York on purpose you know he observed Then he added But there Mr
Fosdick I dont want you to think I aint polite or wont talk myself
Ill do my share when the time comes But it does seem to me that you
ought to do yours first as its your family so far thats done the
objectin    Your cigars gone out Have another light wont you

The visitor shook his head No thank you not now he said hastily
placing the defunct cigar carefully on the captains desk I wont
smoke for the minute So you want me to begin the talking do you It
seems to me I have begun it I told you that I do not like the idea
of my daughters being engaged toto say nothing of marryingyour
grandson My wife likes it even less than I do That is enough of a
statement to begin with isnt it

Why no not exactly if youll excuse my sayin so Your daughter
herselfhow does she feel about it

Oh she is enthusiastic naturally She appears to be suffering from
temporary insanity on the subject

She dont seem to think its quite aserpreposterous and ridiculous
and outrageousand Lord knows what allas your wife does eh

No I say Snow I hope youre not too deeply offended by what my wife
wrote you I judge you are quoting from her letter and apparently she
piled it on redhot Youll have to excuse her she was almost wild all
day yesterday Ill ask your pardon on her behalf

Sho sho No need Mr Fosdick no need at all I know what women
are even the easygoin kind when theyve got steam up Ive got a
wifeand I had a daughter But gettin back on the course again you
think your daughters crazy because she wants to marry my grandson Is
that it

Why no I wouldnt say that exactly Of course I wouldnt say that

But you see you did say it However well leave that to one side
for a spell What objectionwhat real objection is there to those two
marryinmy grandson and your daughterprovided that they care for
each other as theyd ought to

Mr Fosdicks expression changed slightly His tone as he replied to
the question was colder and his manner less cordial

I dont know that it is worth while answering that in detail he said
after an instants pause Frankly Captain Snow I had rather hoped
you would see for yourself the reasons why such a marriage wouldnt be
desirable If you dont see them if you are backing up your grandson
in his business whywell there is no use in our discussing the matter
any further is there We should only lose our tempers and not gain
much So we had better end it now I think

He rose to his feet Captain Zelotes leaning forward held up a
protesting hand

Nownow Mr Fosdick he said earnestly I dont want you to
misunderstand me And Im sorry if what I said has made you mad

Fosdick smiled Oh Im not mad he answered cheerfully I make it
a rule in all my business dealings not to get mad or more especially
not to let the other fellow know that Im getting that way My temper
hasnt a ruffle in it just now and I am leaving merely because I want
it to remain smooth I judge that you and I arent going to agree All
right then well differ but well differ without a fight thats all
Good afternoon Captain

But Captain Lotes hand still remained uplifted

Mr Fosdick he said just a minute nowjust a minute You never
have met Albert my grandson have you Never even seen him maybe

No but I intend to meet him and talk with him before I leave South
Harniss He was one of the two people I came here to meet

And I was the other eh Umhm    I see You think youve found out
where I stand and now youll size him up Honest Mr Fosdick I   
Humph Mind if I tell you a little story Twont take long When I was
a little shaver me and my granddad the first Capn Lote Snowtheres
been two sincewere great chums When he was home from sea he and I
stuck together like hot pitch and oakum One day we were sittin out in
the front yard of his houseits mine nowwatchin a hoptoad catch
flies Youve seen a toad catch flies havent you Mr Fosdick Mr
Toad sits there lookin half asleep and as pious and demure as a
pickpocket at campmeetin until a fly comes along and gets too near
Then Zip out shoots about six inches of toad tongue and that flys
been asked in to dinner Well granddad and I sat lookin at our
particular toad when along came a bumblebee and lighted on a
honeysuckle blossom right in front of the critter The toad didnt take
time to think it over all he saw was a square meal and his tongue
flashed out and nailed that bumblebee and snapped it into the pantry
In about a half second though there was a change The pantry had been
emptied the bumblebee was on his way again and Mr Toad was on
his hoppin lively and huntin forwell for ice water or somethin
coolin I guess likely Granddad tapped me on the shoulder Sonny
says he theres a lesson for you That hoptoad didnt wait to make
sure that bumblebee was good to eat he took it for granted and was
sorry afterward It dont pay to jump at conclusions son he says
Some conclusions are like that bumblebees they have stings in em

Captain Lote having finished his story felt in his pocket for a match
Fosdick for an instant appeared puzzled Then he laughed

I see he said You think I made too quick a jump when I concluded
you were backing your grandson in this affair All right Im glad to
hear it What do you want me to do sit down again and listen

He resumed his seat as he asked the question Captain Zelotes nodded

If you dont mind he answered You see you misunderstood me Mr
Fosdick I didnt mean any more than what I said when I asked you
what real objection there was in your opinion to Alberts marryin
yourerMadeline thats her name I believe Seems to me the way for
us to get to an understandinyou and Iis to find out just how the
situation looks to each of us When weve found out that well know how
nigh we come to agreein or disagreein and can act accordin Sounds
reasonable dont it

Fosdick nodded in his turn Perfectly he admitted Well ask your
questions and Ill answer them After that perhaps Ill ask some
myself Go ahead

I have gone ahead Ive asked one already

Yes but it is such a general question There may be so many
objections

I see All right then Ill ask some What do the lawyers call
emAtlantic Pacific Ive got itIll ask some specific questions
Heres one Do you object to Al personally To his character

Not at all We know nothing about his character Very likely he may be
a young saint

Well he aint so well let that slide Hes a good boy though so
far as Ive ever been able to find out Is it his looks Youve never
seen him but your wife has Dont she like his looks

She hasnt mentioned his looks to me

Is it his money He hasnt got any of his own

Weell of course that does count a little bit Madeline is our only
child and naturally we should prefer to have her pick out a husband
with a dollar or so in reserve

Umhm Als twentyone Mr Fosdick When I was twentyone I had some
put by but not much I presume likely twas different with you maybe
Probably you were pretty well fixed

Fosdick laughed aloud You make a good crossexaminer Snow he
observed As a matter of fact when I was twentyone I was assistant
bookkeeper in a New Haven brokers office I didnt have a cent except
my salary and I had that only for the first five days in the week

However you got married

Yes I did More fool I If I had known anything I should have waited
five years at least I didnt have any one to tell me so My father and
mother were both dead

Think youd have listened to em if they had been alive and had told
you However however thats all to one side Well Alberts havin no
money to speak of is an objectionand a good honest one from your point
of view His prospects here in this business of mine are fair and he
is doin better at it than he was so he may make a comftable livina
comftable South Harniss livin that isby and by

Oh he is with you then Oh yes I remember my wife said he worked in
your office But she said more about his being some sort of aa poet
wasnt it

For the first time since the interview began the captain looked ill at
ease and embarrassed

Thunderation he exclaimed testily you mustnt pay attention to
that He does make up poetry pieceseron the side as you might say
but I keep hopin all the time hell grow out of it give him time It
aint his regular job you mustnt think tis

The visitor laughed again Im glad of that he said both for your
sake and mine I judge that you and I Snow are in complete agreement
as far as our opinion of poetry and that sort of stuff is concerned
Of course Im not condemning all poetry you understand Longfellow and
Tennyson and the regular poets are all right You understand what Im
getting at

Sartin I used to know Down went the Ryal George with all her crew
complete and a lot more Used to say em over to myself when I first
went to sea and stood watch alone nights But they were different you
know theythey

Sure My wifewhy I give you my word that my own wife and her set
go perfectly daffy over chaps who write stuff that rhymes and that the
papers are printing columns about Snow if this grandson of yours was
a genuine presstouted womens club poet instead of a wouldbewell
I dont know what might happen In that case she might be as strong FOR
this engagement as she is now against it

He paused seeming a bit ashamed of his own heat Captain Zelotes
however regarded him with more approval than he had yet shown

Its been my observation that women are likely to get off the course
chasin false signals like that he observed When a man begins
lettin his hair and his mouth run wild together seems as if the
combination had an attraction for a good many women folks Al keeps his
hair cut though Ill say that for him he added It curls some but
it aint long I wouldnt have him in the office if twas

Well Mr Fosdick he continued what other objections are they
Manners Family and relations Education Any objections along that
line

Noo no Iwell I dont know you see I dont know much about the
young fellow

Perhaps I can help you out As to mannerswell you can judge them for
yourself when you see him He seems to be in about every kind of social
doins there is down here and hes as much or more popular with the
summer folks than with the yearrounders Education Well thats
fair to middlin as I see it He spent nine or ten years in a mighty
expensive boardin school up in New York State

Did he What school

The captain gave the name of the school Fosdick looked surprised

Humph That IS a good school he said

Is it Depends on what you call good I callate Al learned a good
deal of this and that a little bit of foreign language some that they
call dead and some that ought to be deadand buried cordin to my
notion When he came to me he couldnt add up a column of ten figgers
without makin a mistake and as for businesswell what he knew about
business was about equal to what Noah knew about a gas engine

He paused to chuckle and Fosdick chuckled with him

As to family went on Captain Lote hes a Snow on his mothers side
and theres been seven generations of Snows in this part of the Cape
since the first one landed here So far as I know theyve all managed
to keep out of jail which may have been more good luck than deservin
in some cases

His father queried Fosdick

The captains heavy brows drew together His father was a Portygeeor
Spaniard I believe is rightand he was a playactor one of
thosewhat do you call emopera singers

Fosdick seemed surprised and interested Oh indeed he exclaimed an
opera singer    Why he wasnt Speranza the baritone was he

Maybe I believe he was He married my daughter andwell we wont
talk about him if you dont mind

But Speranza was a

IF you dont mind Mr Fosdick

Captain Lote lapsed into silence drumming the desk with his big
fingers His visitor waited for a few moments At length he said

Well Captain Snow I have answered your questions and you have
answered mine Do you think we are any nearer an agreement now

Captain Zelotes seemed to awake with a start Eh he queried
Agreement Oh I dont know Did you find anyerwhat you might call
vital objections in the boys record

Noo No all that is all right His family and his education and all
the rest are good enough Im sure But nevertheless

You still object to the young folks gettin married

Yes I do Hang it all Snow this isnt a thing one can reason out
exactly Madeline is our only child she is our pet our baby Naturally
her mother and I have planned for her hoped for her figured that some
day when we had to give her up it would be toto

To somebody that wasnt Albert Speranza of South Harniss Mass   
Eh

Yes Not that your grandson isnt all right I have no doubt he is a
tiptop young fellow But you see

Captain Lote suddenly leaned forward Course I see Mr Fosdick he
interrupted Course I see You object and the objection aint a mite
weaker on account of your not bein able to say exactly what tis

Thats the idea Thank you Captain

Youre welcome I can understand I know just how you feel because
Ive been feelin the same way myself

Oh you have Good Then you can sympathize with Mrs Fosdick and with
me You seeyou understand why we had rather our daughter did not marry
your grandson

Sartin You see Ive had just the same sort of general kind of
objection to Als marryin your daughter

Mr Fletcher Fosdick leaned slowly backward in his chair His appearance
was suggestive of one who has received an unexpected thump between the
eyes

Oh you have he said again but not with the same expression

Umhm said Captain Zelotes gravely Im like you in one way Ive
never met your Madeline any more than you have met Al Ive seen her
once or twice and she is real pretty and nicelookin But I dont know
her at all Now I dont doubt for a minute but that shes a real nice
girl and it might be that shed make Al a fairly good wife

Erwellthanks

Oh thats all right I mean it It might be she would And I aint got
a thing against you or your folks

Humpherthanks again

Thats all right you dont need to thank me But its this way with
meI live in South Harniss all the year round I want to live here till
I die andafter I die Id like firstrate to have Al take up the Z
Snow and Co business and the Snow house and land and keep them goin
till HE dies Mind I aint at all sure that hell do it or be capable
of doin it but thats what Id like Now youre in New York most of
the year and sos your wife and daughter New York is all rightI
aint sayin a word against itbut New York and South Harniss are
different

The Fosdick lip twitched Somewhat different he admitted

Umhm That sounds like a joke I know but I dont mean it so not
now What I mean is that I know South Harniss and South Harniss folks I
dont know New Yorknot so very well though Ive been there plenty of
timesand I dont know New York ways But I do know South Harniss ways
and they suit me Would they suit your daughternot just for summer
but as a reglar thing right straight along year in and out I doubt
it Mr Fosdick I doubt it considable Course I dont know your
daughter

I doand I share your doubts

Umhm But whether she liked it or not shed have to come here if she
married my grandson Either that or hed have to go to New York And if
he went to New York how would he earn his livin Get a new bookkeepin
job and start all over again or live on poetry

Mr Fosdick opened his mouth as if to speak seemed to change his mind
and closed it again without speaking Captain Zelotes looking keenly
at him seemed to guess his thoughts

Of course he said deliberately but with a firmness which permitted
no misunderstanding of his meaning of course you mustnt get it into
your head for one minute that the boy is figgerin on your daughters
bein a rich girl He hasnt given that a thought You take my word for
that Mr Fosdick He doesnt know how much money she or you have got
and he doesnt care He doesnt care a continental darn

His visitor smiled slightly Nevertheless he began The captain
interrupted him

No there aint any nevertheless he said Albert has been with me
enough years now so that I know a little about him And I know that all
he wants is your daughter As to how much shes worth in money or how
theyre goin to live after hes got herI know that he hasnt given it
one thought I dont imagine she has either For one reason he added
with a smile he is too poor a business man to think of marriage as a
business billpayin contract and for anotherfor anotherwhy good
Lord Fosdick he exclaimed leaning forward dont you know what this
thing means to those two young folks It means just moonshine and mush
and lookin into each others eyes thats about all THEY havent
thought any practical thoughts about it Why think what their ages are
Think of yourself at that age Cant you remember    Humph Well
Im talkin fifty revolutions to the second I beg your pardon

Thats all right Snow And I believe you have the situation sized up
as it is Still

Excuse me Mr Fosdick but dont you think its about time you had a
look at the boy himself Im goin to ask him to come in here and meet
you

Fosdick looked troubled Think it is good policy he asked doubtfully
I want to see him and speak with him but I do hate a scene

There wont be any scene You just meet him face to face and talk
enough with him to get a little idea of what your first impression is
Dont contradict or commit yourself or anything And Ill send him out
at the end of two or three minutes

Without waiting for a reply he rose opened the door to the outer
office and called Al come in here When Albert had obeyed the
order he closed the door behind him and turning to the gentleman in
the visitors chair said Mr Fosdick this is my grandson Albert
Speranza Al shake hands with Mr Fosdick from New York

While awaiting the summons to meet the father of his adored Albert had
been rehearsing and rerehearsing the speeches he intended making when
that meeting took place Sitting at his desk pen in hand and pretending
to be busy with the bookkeeping of Z Snow and Company he had seen
not the ruled page of the day book but the parental countenance of the
Honorable Fletcher Fosdick And to his minds eye that countenance
was as rugged and stern as the rockbound coast upon which the Pilgrims
landed and about as unyielding and impregnable as the door of the
office safe So when his grandfather called him he descended from the
tall desk stool and crossed the threshold of the inner room a trifle
pale a little shaky at the knees but with the set chin and erect head
of one who facing almost hopeless odds intends fighting to the last
gasp

To his astonishment the Fosdick countenance was not as his imagination
had pictured it The blue eyes met his not with a glare or a glower
but with a look of interest and inquiry The Fosdick hand shook his with
politeness and the Fosdick manner was if not genial at least quiet
and matter of fact He was taken aback What did it mean Was it
possible that Madelines father was inclined to regard her engagement
to him with favor A great throb of joy accompanied the thought Then
he remembered the letter he had just read the letter from Madelines
mother and the hope subsided

Albert said Captain Zelotes Mr Fosdick has come on here to talk
with us that is with me and you about your affairs He and I have
talked up to the point where it seemed to me you ought to come in for
a spell Ive told him that the news that you and his daughter
wereerfavorably disposed toward each other was as sudden and as big
a surprise to me as twas to him Even your grandma dont know it yet
Now I presume likely hed like to ask you a few questions Heave ahead
Mr Fosdick

He relit his cigar stump and leaned back in his chair Mr Fosdick
leaned forward in his Albert stood very straight his shoulders braced
for the encounter The quizzical twinkle shone in Captain Lotes eye as
he regarded his grandson Fosdick also smiled momentarily as he caught
the expression of the youths face

Well Speranza he began in so cheerful a tone that Alberts
astonishment grew even greater your grandfather has been kind enough
to get us through the preliminaries so well come at once to the
essentials You and my daughter consider yourselves engaged to marry

Yes sir We ARE engaged

I see How long have youumbeen that way so to speak

Since last August

Why havent you said anything about it to usto Mrs Fosdick or me or
your people here You must excuse these personal questions As I have
just said to Captain Snow Madeline is our only child and her happiness
and welfare mean about all there is in life to her mother and me So
naturally the man she is going to marry is an important consideration
You and I have never met before so the quickest way of reaching an
understanding between us is by the question route You get my meaning

Yes sir I guess I do

Good Then well go ahead Why have you two kept it a secret so long

Becausewell because we knew we couldnt marry yet a while so we
thought we had better not announce it for the present

Oh    And the idea that perhaps Mrs Fosdick and I might be
slightly interested didnt occur to you

Why yes sir it did Butbut we thought it best not to tell you
until later

Perhaps the suspicion that we might not be overjoyed by the news had
a little weight with you eh Possibly that helped to delay
theerannouncement

No sir II dont think it did

Oh dont you Perhaps you thought we WOULD be overjoyed

No sir We didnt think so very much about it Well thats not quite
true Madeline felt that her motherand you too sir I suppose
although she didnt speak as often of you in that wayshe felt that her
mother would disapprove at first and so we had better wait

Until when

Untiluntil by and by Until I had gone ahead further you know

Im not sure that I do know Gone ahead how Until you had a better
position more salary

No not exactly Until my writings were better known Until I was a
little more successful

Successful Until you wrote more poetry do you mean

Yes sir Poetry and other things stories and plays perhaps

Do you meanDid you figure that you and Madeline were to live on what
you made by writing poetry and the other stuff

Yes sir of course

Fosdick looked across at Captain Zelotes The Captains face was worth
looking at

Here here hold on he exclaimed jumping into the conversation Al
what are you talkin about Youre bookkeeper for me aint you for
this concern right here where you are What do you mean by talkin as
if your job was makin up poetry pieces Thats only what you do on the
side and you know it Eh aint that so

Albert hesitated He had momentarily forgotten his grandfather and
the latters prejudices After all what was the use of stirring up
additional trouble

Yes Grandfather he said

Course its so Its in this office that you draw your wages

Yes Grandfather

All right Excuse me for nosin in Mr Fosdick but I knew the boy
wasnt puttin the thing as plain as it ought to be and I didnt want
you to get the wrong notion Heave ahead

Fosdick smiled slightly All right Captain he said I get it I
think Well then turning again to Albert your plan for supporting
my daughter was to wait until your position here plus the poetry
should bring in sufficient revenue It didnt occur to you thatwell
that there might be a possibility of getting moneyelsewhere

Albert plainly did not understand but it was just as plain that his
grandfather did Captain Zelotes spoke sharply

Mr Fosdick he said I just answered that question for you

Yes I know But if you were in my place you might like to have him
answer it I dont mean to be offensive but business is business and
after all this is a business talk So

The Captain interrupted So well talk it in a business way eh he
snapped All right Al what Mr Fosdick means is had you callated
that if you married his daughter maybe her dads money might help you
and her to keep goin To put it even plainer had you planned some on
her bein a rich girl

Fosdick looked annoyed Oh I say Snow he cried Thats too strong
altogether

Not a mite Its what youve had in the back of your head all along
Im just helpin it to come out of the front Well Al

The red spots were burning in the Speranza cheeks He choked as he
answered

No he cried fiercely Of course I havent planned on any such thing
I dont know how rich she is I dont care I wish she was as poor
asas I am I want HER thats all And she wants me We dont either
of us care about money I wouldnt take a cent of your money Mr
Fosdick But II want Madeline andandI shall have her

In spite of her parents eh

Yes    Im sorry to speak so Mr Fosdick but it is true Wewe
love each other Weweve agreed to wait for each other no matterno
matter if it is years and years And as for the money and all that if
you disinherit her oror whatever it is they dowe dont care II
hope you will Ishe

Captain Zelotes voice broke in upon the impassioned outburst

Steady Al steady son he cautioned quietly I callate youve said
enough I dont think any mores necessary Youd better go back to your
desk now

But Grandfather I want him to understand

I guess likely he does I should say youd made it real plain Go now
Al

Albert turned but with a shaking hand upon the doorknob turned back
again

ImIIm sorry Mr Fosdick he faltered II didnt mean to say
anything to hurt your feelings Butbut you see Madelineshe and
Iwe

He could not go on Fosdicks nod and answer were not unkindly All
right Speranza he said Im not offended Hope I wasnt too blunt
myself Goodday

When the door had closed behind the young man he turned to Captain Lote

Sorry if I offended you Snow he observed I threw in that hint
about marrying just to see what effect it would have thats all

Umhm So I judged Well you saw didnt you

I did Say Captain except as a prospective soninlaw and then only
because I dont see him in that lightI rather like that grandson of
yours Hes a fine upstanding young chap

The captain made no reply He merely pulled at his beard However he
did not look displeased

Hes a handsome specimen isnt he went on Fosdick No wonder
Madeline fell for his looks Those and the poetry together are a
combination hard to resistat her age And hes a gentleman He handled
himself mighty well while I was stringing him just now

The beard tugging continued Umhm observed Captain Zelotes dryly
he does pretty well for aSouth Harniss gentleman But were kind
of wastin time aint we Mr Fosdick In spite of his looks and his
manners and all the rest now that youve seen him you still object to
that engagement I take it

Why yes I do The boy is all right Im sure but

Sartin I understand I feel the same way about your girl Shes all
right Im sure but

Were agreed on everything includin the but And the but is that
New York is one place and South Harniss is another

Exactly

So we dont want em to marry Fine First rate Only now we come
to the most important but of all What are we going to do about it
Suppose we say no and they say yes and keep on sayin it Suppose they
decide to get married no matter what we say How are we goin to stop
it

His visitor regarded him for a moment and then broke into a hearty
laugh

Snow he declared youre all right You surely have the faculty of
putting your finger on the weak spots Of course we cant stop it If
these two young idiots have a mind to marry and keep that mind they
WILL marry and we cant prevent it any more than we could prevent the
tide coming in tomorrow morning _I_ realized that this was a sort of
fools errand my coming down here I know that this isnt the age when
parents can forbid marriages and get away with it as they used to on
the stage in the old plays Boys and girls nowadays have a way of going
their own gait in such matters But my wife doesnt see it in exactly
that way and she was so insistent on my coming down here to stop the
thing if I could thatwell I came

Im glad you did Mr Fosdick real glad And although I agree with
you that the very worst thing to do if we want to stop this team from
pullin together is to haul back on the bits and holler Whoa still
Im kind of hopeful that maybe    humph I declare it looks as if
Id have to tell you another story Im gettin as bad as Capn Hannibal
Doane used to be and they used to call him The Rope Walk cause he
spun so many yarns

Fosdick laughed again You may go as far as you like with your stories
Captain he said I can grow fat on them

Thanks Well this aint a story exactly it just kind of makes the
point Im tryin to get at Calvin Bangs had a white mare one time and
the critter had a habit of runnin away Once his wife Hannah J was
in the buggy all by herself over to the Ostable Fair Calvin havin got
out to buy some peanuts or somethin The mare got scared of the noise
and crowd and bolted As luck would have it she went right through the
fence and out onto the trottin track And around that track she went
hell bent for election All hands was runnin alongside hollerin Stop
her Stop her but not Calvinno SIR He waited till the mare was
abreast of him the mare on two legs and the buggy on two wheels and
Hannah most anywheres between the dasher and the next world and then
he sung out Give her her head Hannah Give her her head Shell stop
when she runs down

He laughed and his visitor laughed with him

I gather observed the New Yorker that you believe it the better
policy to give our young people their heads

In reasonyes I do Its my judgment that an affair like this will
hurry more and more if you try too hard to stop it If you dont try at
all so any one would notice it it may run down and stop of itself the
way Calvins mare did

Fosdick nodded reflectively Im inclined to agree with you he said
But does that mean that theyre to correspond write love letters and
all that

Why in reason maybe If we say no to that theyll write anyhow
wont they

Of course    How would it do to get them to promise to write
nothing that their parents might not see Of course I dont mean for
your grandson to show you his letters before he sends them to Madeline
Hes too old for that and he would refuse But suppose you asked him
to agree to write nothing that Madeline would not be willing to show her
motheror me Do you think he would

Maybe Ill ask him    Yes I guess likely hed do that

My reason for suggesting it is frankly not so much on account of the
young people as to pacify my wife I am not afraidnot very much afraid
of this love affair They are young both of them Give them time
andas you say Snow the thing may run down peter out

Im in hopes twill Its calf love as I see it and I believe twill
pay to give the calves rope enough

So do I No Im not much troubled about the young people But Mrs
Fosdickwell my trouble will be with her Shell want to have your boy
shot or jailed or hanged or something

I presume likely I guess youll have to handle her the way another
feller who used to live here in South Harniss said he handled his wife
We dont never have any trouble at all says he Whenever she says
yes or no I say the same thing Later on when it comes to doin I do
what I feel like    Eh Youre not goin are you Mr Fosdick

His visitor had risen and was reaching for his coat Captain Zelotes
also rose

Dont hurry dont hurry he begged

Sorry but I must I want to be back in New York tomorrow morning

But you cant can you To do that youll have to get up to Boston or
Fall River and the afternoon trains gone Youd better stay and have
supper along with my wife and me stay at our house over night and take
the early train after breakfast tomorrow

I wish I could Id like nothing better But I cant

Sure Then with a smile he added Al neednt eat with us you know
if his bein there makes either of you feel nervous

Fosdick laughed again I think I should be willing to risk the
nervousness he replied But I must go really Ive hired a chap
at the garage here to drive me to Boston in his car and Ill take the
midnight train over

Humph Well if you must you must Hope you have a comftable trip
Mr Fosdick Better wrap up warm its pretty nigh a fivehour run to
Boston and theres some cool wind over the Ostable marshes this time of
year Goodby sir Glad to have had this talk with you

His visitor held out his hand So am I Snow he said heartily
Mighty glad

I hope I wasnt too short and brisk at the beginnin You see Id
just read your wifes letter anderwell of course I didnt
knowjustyou see you and I had never met and so

Certainly certainly I quite understand And fools errand or not
Im very glad I came here If youll pardon my saying so it was worth
the trip to get acquainted with you I hope whatever comes of the other
thing that our acquaintanceship will continue

Same here same here Go right out the side door Mr Fosdick saves
goin through the office Good day sir

He watched the bulky figure of the New York banker tramping across the
yard between the piles of lumber A moment later he entered the
outer office Albert and Keeler were at their desks Captain Zelotes
approached the little bookkeeper

Labe he queried there isnt anything particular you want me to talk
about just now is there

Lahan looked up in surprise from his figuring

Whywhy no Capn Lote dont knows there is he said Dont
knows there is not now no no no

His employer nodded Good he exclaimed Then Im goin back inside
there and sit down and rest my chin for an hour anyhow Ive talked so
much today that my jaws squeak Dont disturb me for anything short of
a fire or a mutiny



CHAPTER XII


He was not disturbed and that evening after supper was over he
was ready to talk again He and Albert sat together in the sitting
roomMrs Snow and Rachel were in the kitchen washing dishesand
Captain Zelotes told his grandson as much as he thought advisable to
tell of his conversation with the Honorable Fletcher Fosdick At first
Albert was inclined to rebel at the idea of permitting his letters to
Madeline to be read by the latters parents but at length he agreed

Ill do it because it may make it easier for her he said Shell
have a dreadful time I suppose with that unreasonable mother of
hers But by George Grandfather he exclaimed isnt she splendid
though

Who Mrs Fosdick

No of course not indignantly Madeline Isnt she splendid and fine
and loyal I want you to know her Grandfather you and Grandmother

Umhm Well well hope to some day Now son Im goin to ask for
another promise It may seem a hard one to make but Im askin you to
make it I want you to give me your word that no matter what happens
or how long you have to wait you and Madeline wont get married without
tellin her folks and yours beforehand You wont run away and marry
Will you promise me that

Albert looked at him This WAS a hard promise to make In their talks
beneath the rainbows whenever he and Madeline had referred to the
future and its doubts they had always pushed those doubts aside with
vague hints of an elopement If the unreasonableness of parents and
grandparents should crowd them too far they had always as a last
resort the solution of their problem by way of a runaway marriage And
now Captain Zelotes was asking him to give up this last resort

The captain watching him keenly divined what was in his grandsons
mind

Think it over Al he said kindly Dont answer me now but think it
over and tomorrow mornin tell me how you feel about it He hesitated
a moment and then added You know your grandmother and I wewell
we have maybe cause to be a little mite prejudiced against this elopin
business

So Albert thought and the next morning as the pair were walking
together to the office he spoke his thought Captain Zelotes had not
mentioned the subject

Grandfather said Albert with some embarrassment Im going to give
you that promise

His grandfather who had been striding along his heavy brows drawn
together and his glance fixed upon the frozen ground beneath his feet
looked up

Eh he queried uncomprehendingly

You asked me last night to promise you something you know   
You asked me to think it over I have and Im going to promise you
thatMadeline and I wont marry without first telling you

Captain Zelotes stopped in his stride then he walked on again

Thank you Al he said quietly I hoped youd see it that way

Yesyes II do I dont want to bring any moretrouble of that kind
to you and Grandmother    It seems to me that youthat you have had
too much already

Thank you son    Much obliged

The captains tone was almost gruff and that was his only reference to
the subject of the promise but somehow Albert felt that at that moment
he and his grandfather were closer together were nearer to a mutual
understanding and mutual appreciation than they had ever been before

To promise however is one thing to fulfill the obligation another As
the days passed Albert found his promise concerning letterwriting very
very hard to keep When each evening he sat down at the table in
his room to pour out his soul upon paper it was a most unsatisfactory
outpouring The constantly enforced recollection that whatever he wrote
would be subject to the chilling glance of the eye of Fosdick mater was
of itself a check upon the flow To write a love letter to Madeline had
hitherto been a joy a rapture to fill pages and pages a delight Now
somehow these pages were hard to fill Omitting the very things you
were dying to say the precious the intimate thingswhat was
there left He and she had at their meetings and in their former
correspondence invented many delightful little pet names for each
other Now those names were taboo or at any rate they might as well
be The thought of Mrs Fosdicks sniff of indignant disgust at finding
her daughter referred to as some ones ownest little rosebud withered
that bud before it reached the paper

And Madelines letters to him were quite as unsatisfactory They were
lengthy but oh so matter of fact Saharas of fact without one oasis of
sentiment She was well and she had done this and that and had been
to see such and such plays and operas Father was well and very busy
Mother too was well so was Googoobut these last two bits of news
failed to comfort him as they perhaps should He could only try to glean
between the lines and as Mrs Fosdick had raked between those lines
before him the gleaning was scant picking indeed

He found himself growing disconsolate and despondent Summer seemed ages
away And when at last it should comewhat would happen then He could
see her only when properly chaperoned only when Mother and probably
Googoo were present He flew for consolation to the Muse and the
Muse refused to console The poems he wrote were blue and despairing
likewise Consequently they did not sell He was growing desperate
ready for anything And something came Germany delivered to our
Government its arrogant mandate concerning unlimited submarine warfare
A longsuffering President threw patience overboard and answered that
mandate in unmistakable terms Congress stood at his back and behind
them a united and indignant people The United States declared war upon
the Hun

South Harniss like every other community became wildly excited
Captain Zelotes Snows gray eyes flashed fiery satisfaction The flags
at the Snow place and at the lumber yard flew high night and day He
bought newspapers galore and read from them aloud at meals in the
evenings and before breakfast Issachar as usual talked much and said
little Laban Keelers comments were pithy and dryly pointed Albert was
very quiet

But one forenoon he spoke Captain Lote was in the inner office the
morning newspaper in his hand when his grandson entered and closed the
door behind him The captain looked up

Well Al what is it he asked

Albert came over and stood beside the desk The captain after a
moments scrutiny of the young mans face put down his newspaper

Well Al he said again

Albert seemed to find it hard to speak

Grandfather he began IIGrandfather I have come to ask a favor
of you

The captain nodded slowly his gaze fixed upon his grandsons face

All right heave ahead he said quietly

Grandfather you and I have had a four years agreement to work
together in this office It isnt up yet butbut I want to break it I
want you to let me off

Humph    Let you off eh    What for

Thats what I came here to tell you Grandfather I cant stay
herenow I want to enlist

Captain Zelotes did not answer His hand moved upward and pulled at his
beard

I want to enlist repeated Albert I cant stand it another minute
I must If it hadnt been for you and our promise andand Madeline I
think I should have joined the Canadian Army a year or more ago But now
that we have gone into the war I CANT stay out Grandfather you dont
want me to do you Of course you dont

His grandfather appeared to ponder

If you can wait a spell he said slowly I might be able to fix it
sos you can get a chance for an officers commission Id ought to have
some pull somewheres seems so

Albert sniffed impatient disgust I dont want to get a commissionin
that way he declared

Humph Youll find theres plenty that do I shouldnt wonder

Perhaps but Im not one of them And I dont care so much for a
commission unless I can earn it And I dont want to stay here and
study for it I want to go now I want to get into the thing I dont
want to wait

Captain Lote leaned forward His gray eyes snapped

Want to fight do you he queried

You bet I do

All right my boy then goand fight Id be ashamed of myself if I
held you back a minute Go and fightand fight hard I only wish to God
I was young enough to go with you



CHAPTER XIII


And so in this unexpected fashion came prematurely the end of the
four year trial agreement between Albert Speranza and Z Snow and Co
Of course neither Captain Zelotes nor Albert admitted that it had ended
Each professed to regard the break as merely temporary

Youll be back at that desk in a little while Al said the captain
addin up figgers and tormentin Issy And Alberts reply was
invariably Why of course Grandfather

He had dreaded his grandmothers reception of the news of his intended
enlistment Olive worshiped her daughters boy and although an ardent
patriot was by no means as fiercely belligerent as her husband She
prayed each night for the defeat of the Hun whereas Captain Lote was
for licking him first and praying afterwards Albert feared a scene he
feared that she might be prostrated when she learned that he was to
go to war But she bore it wonderfully well and as for the dreaded
scene there was none

Zelotes says he thinks its the right thing for you to do Albert she
said so I suppose I ought to think so too But oh my dear DO you
really feel that you must Iit dont seem as I could bear to    but
there I mustnt talk so It aint a mite harder for me than it is for
thousands of women all over this world    And perhaps the government
folks wont take you anyway Rachel said she read in the Item about
some young man over in Bayport who was rejected because he had fat feet
She meant flat feet I suppose poor thing Oh dear me Im laughin
and it seems wicked to laugh a time like this And when I think of you
goin Albert II    but there I promised Zelotes I wouldnt
   And they MAY not take you    But oh of course they will of
course they will    Im goin to make you a chicken pie for dinner
today I know how you like it    If only they MIGHT reject you
   But there I said I wouldnt and I wont

Rachel Elliss opinion on the subject and her way of expressing that
opinion were distinctly her own Albert arose early in the morning
following the announcement of his decision to enter the service He had
not slept well his mind was too busy with problems and speculations
to resign itself to sleep He had tossed about until dawn and had then
risen and sat down at the table in his bedroom to write Madeline of
the step he had determined to take He had not written her while he was
considering that step He felt somehow that he alone with no pressure
from without should make the decision Now that it was made and
irrevocably made she must of course be told Telling her however was
not an easy task He was sure she would agree that he had done the right
thing the only thing but

It is going to be very hard for you dear he wrote heedless of
the fact that Mrs Fosdicks censorious eye would see and condemn the
dear It is going to be hard for both of us But I am sure you will
feel as I do that I COULDNT do anything else I am young and strong and
fit and I am an American I MUST go You see it dont you Madeline I
can hardly wait until your letter comes telling me that you feel I did
just the thing you would wish me to do

He hesitated and then even more regardless of the censor added the
quotation which countless young lovers were finding so apt just then


 I could not love thee dear so much
 Loved I not honor more


So when fresh from the intimacy of this communication with his adored
and with the letter in his hand he entered the sittingroom at that
early hour he was not overjoyed to find the housekeeper there ahead
of him And her first sentence showed that she had been awaiting his
coming

Good mornin Albert she said I heard you stirrin round up in
your room and I came down here sos you and I could talk together for a
minute without anybodys disturbin us    Humph I guess likely you
didnt sleep any too well last night did you

Albert shook his head Not too well Rachel he replied

I shouldnt wonder Well I doubt if there was too much sleep anywheres
in this house last night So youre really goin to war are you
Albert

Yes If the war will let me I certainly am

Dear dear    Well II think its what Robert Penfold would have
done if he was in your place Ive been goin over it and goin over it
half the night myself and Ive come to that conclusion Its goin to
be awful hard on your grandma and grandfather and me and Labe all us
folks here at home but I guess its the thing youd ought to do the
Penfold kind of thing

Albert smiled Im glad you think so Rachel he said

Well I do and if Im goin to tell the truth I might as well say I
tried terrible hard to find some good reasons for thinkin twant I
did SO But the only good reasons I could scare up for makin you stay
to home was because home was safe and comftable and where you was goin
want And that kind of reasonin might do fustrate for a passel
of clams out on the flats but it wouldnt be much credit to decent
selfrespectin humans When General Rolleson came to that island and
found his daughter and Robert Penfold livin there in that house made
out of pearls hed built for herWant that him all over Another man
the common run of man would have been satisfied to build her a house
out of wood and lucky to get that but no nothin would do him
but pearls and if theyd have been dimonds hed have been better
satisfied Well    Where was I    Oh yes When General Rolleson
came there and says to his daughter Helen you come home along of
me and she says No I shant leave him meanin Robert Penfold you
understandWhen she says that did Robert Penfold say Thats the talk
Put that in your pipe old man and smoke it No SIR he didnt He
says Helen you go straight home along with your pa and work like fury
till you find out who forged that note and laid it onto me You find
that out he says and then you can come fetch me and not afore
Thats the kind of man HE was And they sailed off and left him behind

Albert shook his head He had heard only about half of the housekeepers
story Pretty rough on him I should say he commented absently

I GUESS twas rough on him poor thing But twas his duty and so he
done it It was rough on Helen havin to go and leave him but twas
rougher still on him Its always roughest seems to me she added
on the ones thats left behind Those that go have somethin to take up
their minds and keep em from thinkin too much The ones that stay to
home dont have much to do EXCEPT think I hope you dont get the notion
that I feel your part of it is easy Al Only a poor crazy idiot could
read the papers these days and feel that any part of this war was EASY
Its awful butbut it WILL keep you too busy to think maybe

I shouldnt wonder Rachel I understand what you mean

Were all goin to miss you Albert This house is goin to be a pretty
lonesome place I callate Your grandmall miss you dreadful and so
will I butbut I have a notion that your grandpas goin to miss you
moren anybody else

He shook his head Oh not as much as all that Rachel he said He
and I have been getting on much better than we used to and we have come
to understand each other better but he is still disappointed in me Im
afraid I dont count for much as a business man you see and besides
Grandfather can never quite forget that I am the son of what he calls a
Portygee play actor

Mrs Ellis looked at him earnestly Hes forgettin it better every
day Albert she said I do declare I never believed Captn Lote Snow
could forget it the way hes doin And youwell youve forgot a whole
lot too Memorys a good thing the land knows she added sagely
but a nice healthy forgetery is worth considerblesome times and in
some cases

Issachar Prices comments on his fellow employees decision to become a
soldier were pointed Issy was disgusted

For thunder sakes Al he demanded taint true that youve enlisted
to go to war and fight them Germans is it

Albert smiled I guess it is Issy he replied

Well by crimus

Somebody had to go you see Is

Well by crimustee

Whats the matter Issy Dont you approve

Approve No by crimus I dont approve I think its a divil of a
note thats what I think

Why

WHY Whos goin to do the work in this office while youre gone Labe
and me thats who and Ill do the heft of it Slavin myself half to
death as tis and nowOh by crimustee This war is a darned nuisance
It hadnt ought to be allowed Thered ought to be a law against it

But of all the interviews which followed Alberts decision the most
surprising and that which he was the least likely to forget was his
interview with Laban Keeler It took place on the evening of the third
day following the announcement of his intention to enlist All that day
and indeed for several days Albert had noted in the little bookkeeper
certain symptoms familiar symptoms they were and from experience the
young man knew what they portended Laban was very nervous his fingers
twitched as he wrote occasionally he rose from his chair and walked
up and down the room he ran his hand through his scanty hair he was
inclined to be irritablethat is irritable for him Albert had noted
the symptoms and was sorry Captain Zelotes noted them and frowned and
pulled his beard

Al he said to his grandson if you can put off goin up to enlist
for a little spell a few days I wish you would Labes gettin ready
to go on one of his vacations

Albert nodded Im afraid he is he said

Oh its as sartin as two and two makes four Ive lived with him
too many years not to know the signs And I did hope he added
regretfully that maybe he was tryin to break off Its been a good
long spell an extry long spell since he had his last spree Ah hum
its a pity a good man should have that weak spot in him aint it But
if you could hang around a few more days while the vacations goin on
Id appreciate it Al I kind of hate to be left here alone with nobody
but Issachar to lean on Issys a good deal like a post in some ways
especially in the makeup of his head but hes too ricketty to lean on
for any length of time

That evening Albert went to the postoffice for the mail On his way
back as he passed the dark corner by the now closed and shuttered
movingpicture theater he was hailed in a whisper

Al said a voice Al

Albert turned and peered into the deep shadow of the theater doorway In
the summer this doorway was a blaze of light and gaiety now it was cold
and bleak and black enough From the shadow a small figure emerged on
tiptoe

Al whispered Mr Keeler Thats you aint it Yes yesyes yes
yesI thought twas I thought so

Albert was surprised For one thing it was most unusual to see the
little bookkeeper abroad after ninethirty His usual evening procedure
when not on a vacation was to call upon Rachel Ellis at the Snow place
for an hour or so and then to return to his room over Simonds shoe
store which room he had occupied ever since the building was erected

There he read so people said until eleven sharp when his lamp was
extinguished During or at the beginning of the vacation periods he
usually departed for some unknown destination destinations which
apparently varied He had been seen hopelessly intoxicated in
Bayport in Ostable in Boston once in Providence When he returned he
never seemed to remember exactly where he had been And as most people
were fond of and pitied him few questions were asked

Why Labe exclaimed Albert Is that you Whats the matter

Busy are you Al queried Laban In a hurry eh Are you In a
hurry Al eh

Why no not especially

Could youcould you spare me two or three minutes Two or three
minutesyes yes Come up to my room could youcould you Al

Yes indeed But what is it Labe

I want to talk Want to talk I do Yes yes yes Saw you go by and
Ive been waitin for you Waitinyes I haveyes

He seized his assistant by the arm and led him across the road toward
the shoe store Albert felt the hand on his arm tremble violently

Are you cold Labe he asked What makes you shiver so

Eh Cold No I aint coldno no no Come Al come

Albert sniffed suspiciously but no odor of alcohol rewarded the sniff
Neither was there any perfume of peppermint Mr Keelers transparent
camouflage at a vacations beginning And Laban was not humming the
refrain glorifying his darling hankypanky Apparently he had not yet
embarked upon the spree which Captain Lote had pronounced imminent But
why did he behave so queerly

I aint the way you think Al declared the little man divining his
thought Im just kind of shaky and nervous thats all Thats all
thats all thats all Yes yes Come come COME

The last come burst from him in an agony of impatience Albert
hastened up the narrow stairs Laban leading the way The latter fumbled
with a key his companion heard it rattling against the keyhole plate
Then the door opened There was a lamp its wick turned low burning
upon the table in the room Mr Keeler turned it up making a trembly
job of the turning Albert looked about him he had never been in that
room before

It was a small room and there was not much furniture in it And it was a
neat room for the room of an old bachelor who was his own chambermaid
Most things seemed to have places where they belonged and most of them
appeared to be in those places What impressed Albert even more was the
number of books There were books everywhere in the cheap bookcase on
the pine shelf between the windows piled in the corners heaped on the
table beside the lamp They were worn and shabby volumes for the most
part some with but half a cover remaining some with none He picked up
one of the latter It was Locke on The Human Understanding and next it
to his astonishment was Alices Adventures in Wonderland

Mr Keeler looked over his shoulder and for an instant the whimsical
smile which was characteristic of him curved his lip

Philosophy Al he observed If Locke dont suit you try the mad
hatter feller I get considerble comfort out of the hatter myself
Do you remember when the mouse was tellin the story about the three
sisters that lived in the well He said they lived on everything that
began with M Alice says Why with an M And the hatter or the March
hare I forget which twas says prompt Why not    Yes yes why
not thats what he said    Theres some philosophy in that Al Why
does a hen go across the road Why not Why is Labe Keeler a disgrace to
all his friends and the town he lives in Why not    Eh    Yes
yes Thats itwhy not

He smiled again but there was bitterness and not humor in the smile
Albert put a hand on his shoulder

Why Labe he asked in concern what is it

Laban turned away

Dont mind me Al he said hurriedly I mean dont mind if I act
funny ImIm kind ofofOh good Lord Amighty DONT look at me
like that    I beg your pardon Al I didnt mean to bark like a dog
at you No I didntno no Forgive me will you Will you Al eh

Of course I will But what is the matter Labe Sit down and tell me
about it

Instead of sitting the little bookkeeper began to walk up and down

Dont mind me Al he said hurriedly Dont mind me Let me go my
own gait My own gaityes yes You see Al IIm tryin to enlist
same as youre goin to do andand MY fights begun already Yes
indeedyes yesit has so

Albert was more astonished than ever There was no smell of alcohol and
Keeler had declared that he had not been drinking but

Youre going to ENLIST repeated Albert YOU Why Labe what

Laban laughed nervously Not to kill the Kaiser he replied No no
not thatnot exactly Id like to only I wouldnt be much help that
way Butbut Al II want to do somethin IId like to try to
showId like to be an American a decent American and the best way
to begin seems to me is to try and be a man a decent man Eh You
understand IIOh Lord what a mess I am makin of this IIAl
turning and desperately waving his hands Im goin to try to swear
off Will you help me

Alberts answer was enthusiastic You bet I will he exclaimed Keeler
smiled pathetically

Its goin to be some job I callate he said Some job yes yes
But Im goin to try it Al I read in the papers tother day that
America needed every man Then you enlisted Alor youre goin to
enlist It set me to thinkin Id try to enlist too For the duration
of the war eh Yes yes

Good for you Labe Bully

Laban held up a protesting hand Dont hurrah yet Al he said This
aint the first time Ive tried it Ive swore off a dozen times in the
last fifteen years Ive promised Rachel and broke the promise over and
over again Broke my promise to her the best woman in the world Shows
what I am what sort I am dont it Al Yes it doesyes yes And
shes stuck by me too Lord knows why Last time I broke it I said Id
never promise her again Bad enough to be a common drunk without bein a
liaryes yes But this is a little different Seems to meseems so

He began his pacing up and down again

Seems different somehow he went on Seems like a new chance I want
to do somethin for Uncle Sam IId like to try and enlist for the
duration of the warswear off for that long anyhow Then maybe Id
be able to keep on for life you knowduration of Labe Keeler eh Yes
yes yes But I could begin for just the war couldnt I Maybe twould
fool me into thinkin that was easier

Of course Labe Its a good idea

Maybe and maybe its a fool one But Im goin to try it I AM tryin
it have been all day

He paused drew a shaking hand across his forehead and then asked Al
will you help me I asked you up here hopin you would Will you Al
eh Will you

Albert could not understand how he could possibly help another man keep
the pledge but his promise was eagerly given

Certainly Labe he said

Thanks    thank you Al    And now will you do something for
mea favor

Gladly What is it

Laban did not answer at once He appeared to be on the point of
doing so but to be struggling either to find words or to overcome a
tremendous reluctance When he did speak the words came in a burst

Go down stairs he cried Down those stairs you came up At the foot
of em in a kind of cupboard place under em theresthere probably
is a jug a full jug It was due to come by express today and I
callate it did callate Jim Young fetched it down this afternoon II
could have looked for myself and seen if twas there he added after
a momentary hesitation butbut I didnt dare to I was afraid
IdId

All right Labe I understand What do you want me to do with it if it
is there

I want youI want you toto The little bookkeeper seemed to be
fighting another internal battle between inclination and resolution The
latter won for he finished with I want you to take it out back of the
buildin andand empty it Thats what I want you to do empty it Al
every drop    And for the Almightys sake go quick he ordered
desperately or Ill tell you not to before you start Go

Albert went He fumbled in the cupboard under the stairs found the
juga large one and heavyand hastened out into the night with it in
his hands Behind the shoe store amid a heap of old packing boxes
and other rubbish he emptied it The process was rather lengthy and
decidedly fragrant As a finish he smashed the jug with a stone Then he
climbed the stairs again

Laban was waiting for him drops of perspiration upon his forehead

Waswas it there he demanded

Albert nodded

Yes yes Twas there eh And did youdid you

Yes I did jug and all

Thank you Al    thank you    IIve been trying to muster up
spunk enough to do it myself butbut I swan I couldnt I didnt dast
to go nigh it    Im a fine specimen aint I now he added with a
twisted smile Some coward eh Yes yes Some coward

Albert realizing a little of the fight the man was making was affected
by it Youre a brick Labe he declared heartily And as for being
a cowardWell if I am half as brave when my turn comes I shall be
satisfied

Laban shook his head I dont know how scared Id be of a German
bombshell he said but Im everlastin sure I wouldnt run from it
for fear of runnin towards it and thats how I felt about that jug
   Yes yes yes I did so    Im much obliged to you Al I shant
forget itno no I callate you can trot along home now if you want
to Im pretty safefor tonight anyhow Guess likely the new recruit
wont desert afore morning

But Albert watching him intently refused to go

Im going to stay for a while Labe he said Im not a bit sleepy
really Lets have a smoke and talk together That is of course unless
you want to go to bed

Mr Keeler smiled his twisted smile I aint crazy to he said The
way I feel now Id get to sleep about week after next But I hadnt
ought to keep you up Al

Rubbish Im not sleepy I tell you Sit down Have a cigar Now what
shall we talk about How would books do What have you been reading
lately Labe

They smoked and talked books until nearly two Then Laban insisted upon
his guest departing Im all right Al he declared earnestly I am
honestyes yes I am Ill go to sleep like a lamb yes indeed

Youll be at the office in the morning wont you Labe

The little bookkeeper nodded Ill be there he said Got to answer
roll call the first mornin after enlistment Yes yes Ill be there
Al

He was there but he did not look as if his indulgence in the lamblike
sleep had been excessive He was so pale and haggard that his assistant
was alarmed

Youre not sick are you Labe he asked anxiously Laban shook his
head

No he said No I aint sick Been doin picket duty up and down the
room since half past three thats all Umhm thats all Say Al if
General whatshisnameervon Hindenburgis any harder scrapper
than old Field Marshal Barleycorn hes a pretty tough one Say Al you
didnt say anything aboutabout myerenlistin to Capn Lote did
you I meant to ask you not to

I didnt Labe I thought you might want it kept a secret

Umhm Better keep it in the ranks until we know how this
firsterskirmish is comin out Yes yes Better keep it that way
Umhm

All day he stuck manfully at his task and that evening immediately
after supper Albert went to the room over the shoe store found him
there and insisted upon his coming over to call upon Rachel He had not
intended doing so

You see Al he explained ImIm kind ofershaky and Rachel
will be worried Im afraid She knows me pretty well and shell
callate Im just gettin ready toto bust loose again

Albert interrupted No she wont Laban he said Well show her
that youre not

You wont say anything to her about myerenlistin Al Dont
No no Ive promised her too many timesand broke the promises If
anything should come of this fight of mine Id rather shed find it out
for herself Better to surprise her than to disappint her Yes yes
lots better

Albert promised not to tell Rachel and so Laban made his call When it
was over the young man walked home with him and the pair sat and talked
until after midnight just as on the previous night The following
evening it was much the same except that as Mr Keeler pronounced
himself more than usually shaky and expressed a desire to keep
movin they walked half way to Orham and back before parting By the
end of the week Laban declared the fight wonfor the time

Youve pulled me through the fust tussle Al he said I shant
desert now not till the next breakout anyhow I callate itll get me
harder than ever then Harder than everyes yes And you wont be here
to help me neither

Never mind I shall be thinking of you Labe And I know youre going
to win I feel it in my bones

Umhm    Yes yes yes   In your bones eh Well MY bones dont
seem to feel much except rheumatics once in a while I hope yours
are better prophets but I wouldnt want to bet too high on it No I
wouldntno no However well do our best and they say angels cant
do any morethough theyd probably do it in a different way    some
different    Umhm    Yes indeed

Two letters came to Albert before that week ended The first was from
Madeline He had written her of his intention to enlist and this was her
reply The letter had evidently been smuggled past the censor for it
contained much which Mrs Fosdick would have bluepenciled Its contents
were a blend of praise and blame of exaltation and depression He was
a hero and so brave and she was so proud of him It was wonderful his
daring to go and just what she would have expected of her hero If only
she might see him in his uniform So many of the fellows she knew had
enlisted They were wonderfully brave too although of course nothing
like as wonderful as her own etcetera etcetera She had seen some of
THEM in their uniforms and they were PERFECTLY SPLENDID But they
were officers or they were going to be Why wasnt he going to be an
officer It was so much nicer to be an officer And if he were one he
might not have to go away to fight nearly so soon Officers stayed here
longer and studied you know Mother had said something about a common
private and she did not like it But never mind she would be just as
proud no matter what he was And she should dream of him and think of
him always and always And perhaps he might be so brave and wonderful
that he would be given one of those war crosses the Croix de Guerre or
something She was sure he would But oh no matter what happened he
must not go where it was TOO dangerous Suppose he should be wounded
Oh suppose SUPPOSE he should be killed What would she do then What
would become of her MUST he go after all Couldnt he stay at home and
study or something for a while you know She should be so lonely after
he was gone And so frightened and so anxious And he wouldnt forget
her would he no matter where he went Because she never never never
would forget him for a moment And he must write every day And

The letter was fourteen pages long

The other letter was a surprise It was from Helen The Reverend Mr
Kendall had been told of Alberts intended enlistment and had written
his daughter


So you are going into the war Albert she wrote I am not surprised
because I expected you would do just that It is what all of us would
like to do Im sure and you were always anxious to go even before the
United States came in So I am writing this merely to congratulate you
and to wish you the very best of good luck Father says you are not
going to try for a commission but intend enlisting as a private I
suppose that is because you think you may get to the actual fighting
sooner I think I understand and appreciate that feeling too but are
you sure it is the best plan You want to be of the greatest service
to the country and with your education and brainsThis ISNT flattery
because it is truedont you think you might help more if you were in
command of men Of course I dont know being only a girl but I have
been wondering No doubt you know best and probably it is settled before
this at any rate please dont think that I intend butting in Butting
in is not at all a proper expression for a schoolmarm to use but it is
a relief to be human occasionally Whatever you do I am sure will be the
right thing and I know all your friends are going to be very very proud
of you I shall hear of you through the people at home I know and
I shall be anxious to hear I dont know what I shall do to help the
cause but I hope to do something A musket is prohibitive to females
but the knitting needle is ours and I CAN handle that if I do say it
And I MAY go in for Red Cross work altogether But I dont count much
and you men do and this is your day Please for the sake of your
grandparents and all your friends dont take unnecessary chances I can
see your face as you read that and think that I am a silly idiot Im
not and I mean what I say You see I know YOU and I know you will not be
content to do the ordinary thing We want you to distinguish yourself
but also we want you to come back whole and sound if it is possible
We shall think of you a great deal And please in the midst of the
excitement of the BIG work you are doing dont forget us home folk
including your friend

HELEN KENDALL


Alberts feelings when he read this letter were divided He enjoyed
hearing from Helen The letter was just like herself sensible and
goodhumored and friendly There were no hysterics in it and no
heroics but he knew that no one except his grandparents and Rachel and
Labanand of course his own Madelinewould think of him oftener or
be more anxious for his safety and welfare than Helen He was glad she
was his friend very glad But he almost wished she had not written He
felt a bit guilty at having received the letter He was pretty sure
that Madeline would not like the idea He was tempted to say nothing
concerning it in his next letter to his affianced but that seemed
underhanded and cowardly so he told her And in her next letter to him
Madeline made no reference at all to Helen or her epistle so he knew
she was displeased And he was miserable in consequence

But his misery did not last long The happenings which followed crowded
it from his mind and from Madelines also for that matter One
morning having told no one except his grandfather of his intention he
took the morning train to Boston When he returned the next day he
was Uncle Sams man sworn in and accepted He had passed the physical
examination with flying colors and the recruiting officers expressed
themselves as being glad to get him He was home for but one day leave
then he must go to stay He had debated the question of going in for a
commission but those were the early days of our participation in
the war and a Plattsburg training or at least some sort of military
education was almost an essential He did not want to wait as he had
told his grandfather he wanted to fight So he enlisted as a private

And when the brief leave was over he took the train for Boston no
longer Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza South Harnisss Beau Brummel
poet and Portygee but Private Speranza USA The farewells were brief
and no one criedmuch His grandmother hugged and kissed him Rachel
looked very much as if she wanted to Laban and Issachar shook hands
with him

Good luck to you boy said Mr Keeler All the luck there is

Same to you old man replied Albert Then in a lower tone he added
Well fight it out together eh

Well try Yes yes Well try So long Al

Issachar struck the reassuring note Dont fret about things in the
office he said Ill look out for em longs I keep my health

Be sure and keep that Issy

You bet you Only thing thats liable to break it down is overwork

Captain Zelotes said very little Write us when you can Al he said
And come home whenever you get leave

You may be sure of that Grandfather And after I get to camp perhaps
you can come and see me

Maybe so Will if I can    Well Al I    I    Good luck to
you son

Thank you Grandfather

They shook hands Each looked as if there was more he would have liked
to say but found the saying hard Then the engine bell rang and the
hands fell apart The little group on the station platform watched
the train disappear Mrs Snow and Rachel wiped their eyes with their
handkerchiefs Captain Zelotes gently patted his wifes shoulder

The teams waitin Mother he said Labell drive you and Rachel
home

Butbut aint you comin too Zelotes faltered Olive Her husband
shook his head

Not now Mother he answered Got to go back to the office

He stood for an instant looking at the faint smear of smoke above the
curve in the track Then without another word he strode off in the
direction of Z Snow and Cos buildings Issachar Price sniffed

Crimus he whispered to Laban as the latter passed him on the way to
where Jessamine the Snow horse was tied the old man takes it cool
dont he I kind of imagined hed be sort of shook up by Als goin off
to war but he dont seem to feel it a mite

Keeler looked at him in wonder Then he drew a long breath

Is he said slowly it is a mighty good thing for the Seven Wise Men
of Greece that they aint alive now

It was Issachars turn to stare Eh he queried The Seven Wise Men
of Which Good thing for em they aint alive What kind of talks that
Why is it a good thing

Laban spoke over his shoulder Because he drawled if they was alive
now theyd be so jealous of you theyd commit suicide Yes they would
   Yes yes

With which enigmatical remark he left Mr Price and turned his attention
to the tethered Jessamine

And then began a new period a new life at the Snow place and in the
office of Z Snow and Co Or rather life in the old house and at the
lumber and hardware office slumped back into the groove in which it had
run before the opera singers son was summoned from the New York school
to the home and into the lives of his grandparents Three people instead
of four sat down at the breakfast table and at dinner and at supper
Captain Zelotes walked alone to and from the office Olive Snow no
longer baked and iced large chocolate layer cakes because a certain
inmate of her household was so fond of them Rachel Ellis discussed
Foul Play and Robert Penfold with no one The house was emptier more
oldfashioned and behind the times more lonelysurprisingly empty and
behind the times and lonely

The daily mails became matters of intense interest and expectation
Albert wrote regularly and of course well and entertainingly He
described the life at the camp where he and the other recruits were
training a camp vastly different from the enormous military towns built
later on for housing and training the drafted men He liked the life
pretty well he wrote although it was hard and a fellow had precious
little opportunity to be lazy Mistakes too were unprofitable for the
maker Captain Lotes eye twinkled when he read that

Later on he wrote that he had been made a corporal and his grandmother
to whom a major general and a corporal were of equal rank rejoiced much
both at home and in church after meeting was over and friends came to
hear the news Mrs Ellis declared herself not surprised It was the
Robert Penfold in him coming out so she said

A month or two later one of Alberts letters contained an interesting
item of news In the little spare time which military life afforded him
he continued to write verse and stories Now a New York publisher not
one of the most prominent but a reputable and enterprising one had
written him suggesting the collecting of his poems and their publication
in book form The poet himself was naturally elated

Isnt it splendid he wrote The best part of it of course is that
he asked to publish I did not ask him Please send me my scrapbook and
all loose manuscript When the book will come out Im sure I dont know
In fact it may never come out we have not gotten as far as terms and
contracts yet but I feel we shall Send the scrapbook and manuscript
right away PLEASE

They were sent In his next letter Albert was still enthusiastic

I have been looking over my stuff he wrote and some of it is pretty
good if you dont mind my saying so Tell Grandfather that when this
book of mine is out and selling I may be able to show him that poetry
making isnt a paupers job after all Of course I dont know how much
it will sellperhaps not more than five or ten thousand at firstbut
even at ten thousand at say twentyfive cents royalty each would be
twentyfive hundred dollars and thats something Why Ben Hur the
novel you know has sold a million I believe

Mrs Snow and Rachel were duly impressed by this prophecy of affluence
but Captain Zelotes still played the skeptic

A million at twentyfive cents a piece exclaimed Olive Why
Zelotes thatsthats an awful sight of money

Mental arithmetic failing her she set to work with a pencil and paper
and after a strenuous struggle triumphantly announced that it came to
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars

My soul and body she cried Two hundred and fifty thousand DOLLARS
My SOUL Zelotes Supposeonly suppose Alberts book brought him in as
much as that

Her husband shook his head I cant Olive he said without looking
up from his newspaper My supposer wouldnt stand the strain

But it might Zelotes it MIGHT Suppose it did what would you say
then

The captain regarded her over the top of the Transcript I shouldnt
say a word Olive he answered solemnly I should be down sick by the
time it got up as far as a thousand and anything past two thousand
you could use to buy my tombstone with    There there Mother
he added noticing the hurt look on her face dont feel bad Im only
jokin One of these days Als goin to make a nice comftable livin
sellin lumber and hardware right here in South Harniss I can SEE that
money in the offin All this million or two thats comin from poetry
and such is out of sight in the fog It may be there buthumph well I
KNOW where Z Snow and Co is located

Olive was not entirely placated I must say I think youre awful
discouragin to the poor boy Zelotes she said Her husband put down
his paper

No no I aint Mother he replied earnestly At least I dont mean
to be Way I look at it this poetrymakin and writin yarns and that
sort of stuff is just part of the youngstersergrowin up as you
might say Give him time hell grow out of it same as I callate he
will out of this girl business thiserMadelhumpherahem   
Looks like a good day tomorrow dont it

He pulled up suddenly and with considerable confusion He had kept the
news of his grandsons infatuation and engagement even from his wife
No one in South Harniss knew of it no one except the captain Helen
Kendall knew but she was in Boston

Rachel Ellis picked up the half knitted Red Cross mitten in her lap
Well I dont know whether hes right or you are Capn Lote she
said with a sigh but this I do knowI wish this awful war was over
and he was back home again

That remark ended the conversation Olive resumed her own knitting
seeing it but indistinctly Her husband did not continue his newspaper
reading Instead he rose and saying something about callatin he would
go for a little walk before turning in went out into the yard

But the war did not end it went on so too did the enlisting and
training In the early summer Albert came home for a two days leave He
was broader and straighter and browner His uniform became him and more
than ever the eyes of South Harnisss youthful femininity native or
imported followed him as he walked the village streets But the glances
were not returned not in kind that is The new Fosdick home although
completed was not occupied Mrs Fosdick had that summer decided
that her duties as mover in goodness knows how many war work activities
prevented her taking her usual summer rest Instead she and Madeline
occupied a rented villa at Greenwich Connecticut coming into town
for meetings of all sorts Captain Zelotes had his own suspicions as to
whether war work alone was the cause of the Fosdicks shunning of what
was to have been their summer home but he kept those suspicions to
himself Albert may have suspected also but he too said nothing The
censored correspondence between Greenwich and the training camp traveled
regularly and South Harniss damsels looked and longed in vain He
saw them he bowed to them he even addressed them pleasantly and
charmingly but to him they were merely incidents in his walks to and
from the postoffice In his minds eye he saw but one and she alas
was not present in the flesh

Then he returned to the camp where later on Captain Zelotes and Olive
visited him As they came away the captain and his grandson exchanged a
few significant words

It is likely to be almost any time Grandfather said Albert quietly
They are beginning to send them now as you know by the papers and we
have had the tip that our turn will be soon So

Captain Lote grasped the significance of the uncompleted sentence

I see Al he answered I see Well boy IIGood luck

Good luck Grandfather

That was all that and one more handclasp Our AngloSaxon inheritance
descends upon us in times like these The captain was silent for most of
the ride to the railroad station

Then followed a long significant interval during which there were no
letters from the young soldier After this a short reassuring cablegram
from Somewhere in France Safe Well it read and Olive Snow carried
it about with her in the bosom of her gown all that afternoon and put
it upon retiring on her bureau top so that she might see it the first
thing in the morning

Another long interval then letters the reassuring but so tantalizingly
unsatisfactory letters we American families were just at that time
beginning to receive Reading the newspapers now had a personal
interest a terrifying dreadful interest Then the packing and sending
of holiday boxes over the contents of which Olive and Rachel spent much
careful planning and anxious preparation Then another interval of more
letters letters which hinted vaguely at big things just ahead

Then no letter for more than a month

And then one noon as Captain Zelotes returned to his desk after the
walk from home and dinner Laban Keeler came in and stood beside that
desk

The captain looking up saw the little bookkeepers face What is it
Labe he asked sharply

Laban held a yellow envelope in his hand

It came while you were gone to dinner Capn he said Ben Kelley
fetched it from the telegraph office himself Hehe said he didnt
hardly want to take it to the house He callated youd better have it
here to read to yourself fust Thats what he saidyes yesthats
what twas Capn

Slowly Captain Zelotes extended his hand for the envelope He did not
take his eyes from the bookkeepers face

BenBen he told me what was in it Capn Lote faltered Laban II
dont know what to say to you I dontno no

Without a word the captain took the envelope from Keelers fingers and
tore it open He read the words upon the form within

Laban leaned forward

For the Lord sakes Lote Snow he cried in a burst of agony
why couldnt it have been some darn goodfornothin like me
insteadinstead of him Oh my God Amighty what a world this is WHAT
a world

Still Captain Zelotes said nothing His eyes were fixed upon the yellow
sheet of paper on the desk before him After a long minute he spoke

Well he said very slowly well Labe there goesthere goes Z
Snow and Company



CHAPTER XIV


The telegram from the War Department was brief as all such telegrams
were perforce obliged to be The Secretary of War through his
representative regretted to inform Captain Zelotes Snow that Sergeant
Albert Speranza had been killed in action upon a certain day It was
enough howeverfor the time quite enough It was not until later
that the little group of South Harniss recovered sufficiently from the
stunning effect of those few words to think of seeking particulars
Albert was dead what did it matter then to know how he died

Olive bore the shock surprisingly well Her husbands fears for her
seemed quite unnecessary The Captain knowing how she had idolized her
daughters boy had dreaded the effect which the news might have upon
her She was broken down by it it is true but she was quiet and
braveastonishingly wonderfully quiet and brave And it was she
rather than her husband who played the part of the comforter in those
black hours

Hes gone Zelotes she said It dont seem possible I know but
hes gone And he died doin his duty same as he would have wanted
to die if hed known twas comin poor boy Soso we must do ours
I suppose and bear up under it the very best we can It wont be very
long Zelotes she added Were both gettin old

Captain Lote made no reply He was standing by the window of the
sittingroom looking out into the wet backyard across which the
winddriven rain was beating in stormy gusts

We must be brave Zelotes whispered Olive tremulously Hed want us
to be and we MUST be

He put his arm about her in a sudden heat of admiration Id be ashamed
not to be after seein you Mother he exclaimed

He went out to the barn a few moments later and Rachel entering the
sittingroom found Olive crumpled down in the big rocker in an agony of
grief

Oh dont Mrs Snow dont she begged the tears streaming down her
own cheeks You mustnt give way to it like this you mustnt

Olive nodded

I know it I know it she admitted chokingly wiping her eyes with a
soaked handkerchief I shant Rachel only this once I promise you
You see I cant I just cant on Zelotess account Ive got to bear up
for his sake

The housekeeper was surprised and a little indignant

For his sake she repeated For mercy sakes why for his sake Is it
any worse for him than tis for you

Oh yes yes lots worse He wont say much of course bein Zelotes
Snow but you and I know how hes planned especially these last years
and how hes begun to count onon Albert    No no I aint goin
to cry Rachel I aintI WONTbut sayin his name you know kind
of

I know I know Land sakes DONT I know Aint I doin it myself

Course you are Rachel But we mustnt when Zelotes is around We
women wewell times like these women HAVE to keep up What would
become of the men if we didnt

So she and Rachel kept up in public and when the captain was present
and he for his part made no show of grief nor asked for pity He was
silent talked little and to the callers who came either at the house or
office was uncomplaining

He died like a man he told the Reverend Mr Kendall when the latter
called He took his chance knowin what that meant

He was glad to take it interrupted the minister Proud and glad to
take it

Sartin Why not Wouldnt you or I have been glad to take ours if we
could

Well Captain Snow I am glad to find you so resigned

Captain Zelotes looked at him Resigned he repeated What do you
mean by resigned Not to sit around and whimper is one thingany decent
man or woman ought to be able to do that in these days but if by bein
resigned you mean Im contented to have it sowell youre mistaken
thats all

Only on one occasion and then to Laban Keeler did he open his shell
sufficiently to give a glimpse of what was inside Laban entered the
inner office that morning to find his employer sitting in the desk
chair both hands jammed in his trousers pockets and his gaze fixed
apparently upon the row of pigeonholes When the bookkeeper spoke to
him he seemed to wake from a dream for he started and looked up

Capn Lote began Keeler Im sorry to bother you but that last
carload of pine was

Captain Zelotes waved his hand brushing the carload of pine out of the
conversation

Labe he said slowly did it seem to you that I was too hard on
him

Laban did not understand Hard on him he repeated I dont knows I
just get

Hard on Al Did it seem to you as if I was a little too much of the
bucko mate to the boy Did I drive him too hard Was I unreasonable

The answer was prompt No Capn Lote replied Keeler

You mean that    Umhm    Well sometimes seems as if I might
have been You see Labe when he first come IWell I callate I
was considerble prejudiced against him Account of his father you
understand

Sartin Sure I understand

It took me a good while to get reconciled to the Portygee streak in
him It chafed me considerble to think there was a foreign streak in
our family The Snows have been straight Yankee for a good long while
   Fact is II never got really reconciled to it I kept bein
fearful all the time that that streak his fathers streak would break
out in him It never did except of course in his poetry and that sort
of foolishness but I was always scared twould you see And nownow
that this has happened II kind of fret for fear that I may have let my
notions get ahead of my fair play You think I did give the boy a square
deal Labe

Sure thing Capn

Im glad of that    Andand you callate he wasntwasnt too
prejudiced against me I dont mean along at first I mean this last
year or two

Laban hesitated He wished his answer to be not an overstatement but
the exact truth

I think he said with emphasis that Al was comin to understand
you better every day he lived Capn Yes and to think more and more
of you too He was gettin older for one thingolder more of a
manyes yes

Captain Zelotes smiled sadly He was more boy than man by a good deal
yet he observed Well Labe hes gone and Im just beginnin to
realize how much of life for me has gone along with him Hed been doin
better here in the office for the last two or three years seemed to be
catchin on to business better Didnt you think so Labe

Sartin Yes indeed Fustrate fustrate

No not firstrate He was a long ways from a business man yet but I
did think he was doin a lot better I could begin to see him pilotin
this craft after I was called ashore Now hes gone and    well I
dont see much use in my fightin to keep it afloat Im gettin along
in yearsand whats the use

It was the first time Laban had ever heard Captain Zelotes refer to
himself as an old man It shocked him into sharp expostulation

Nonsense he exclaimed You aint old enough for the scrap heap by a
big stretch And besides he made his fight didnt he He didnt quit
Al didnt and he wouldnt want us to No siree he wouldnt No sir
no    II hope youll excuse me Capn Lote Ideclare it must
seem to you as if I was talkin pretty fresh I swan Im sorry I am so
   sorry yes yes I be

The captain was not offended He waved the apologies aside

So you think its worth while my fightin it out do you Labe he
asked reflectively

II think its what you ought to do anyhow whether its worth
while or not The whole worlds fightin Uncle Sams fightin Al was
fightin Youre fightin Im fightin Its a darn sight easier to
quit a darn sight butbut Al didnt quit Andand we mustntnot if
we can help it he added drawing a hand across his forehead

His agitation seemed to surprise Captain Zelotes So all hands are
fightin are they Labe he observed Well I presume likely theres
some truth in that Whats your particular fight for instance

The little bookkeeper looked at him for an instant before replying
The captains question was kindly asked but there was or so Laban
imagined the faintest trace of sarcasm in its tone That trace decided
him He leaned across the desk

My particular fight he repeated Youyou want to know what tis
Capn Lote All right all right Ill tell you

And without waiting for further questioning and with for him
surprisingly few repetitions he told of his enlistment to fight John
Barleycorn for the duration of the war Captain Zelotes listened to the
very end in silence Laban mopped his forehead with a hand which shook
much as it had done during the interview with Albert in the room above
the shoe store

Therethere he declared in conclusion thats my fight Capn
Lote Al and I wewe kind of went into it together as you might say
though his enlistin was considerble more heroic than mineyes indeed
I should say so    yes yes yes But Im fightin too    er   
Im fightin too

Captain Zelotes pulled his beard

Hows the fight goin Labe he asked quietly

Wellwell its kind ofkind of spotty as you might say Theres
spots when I get along fairly smooth and others whenwell when its
pretty rough goin Ive had four hard spots since Al went away but
theres two that was the hardest One was along Christmas and New Year
time you know I most generally had one of myerspells along about
then And tother is just now I mean since we got word aboutabout
Al I dont suppose likely you surmised it Capn butbut Id come to
think a lot of that boyyes I had Seems funny to you I dont doubt
but its so And since the word come you knowIIwell Ive had
some fight some fight II dont callate Ive slept moren four hours
in the last four nightsnot moren that no Walkin helps me most
seems so Last night I walked to West Orham

To West Orham You WALKED there Last NIGHT

Umhm Longs I can keep walkin II seem to part way forgetto
forget the stuff you know When Im alone in my room I go most
crazypretty nigh loony    But there I dont know why I got to
talkin like this to you Capn Lote Youve got your troubles and

Hold on Labe Does Rachel know about your fight

No No no Course she must notice how long Ive beenbeen straight
but I havent told her I want to be sure Im goin to win before I
tell her Shes been disappointed times enough before poor woman   
There Capn Lote dont lets talk about it any more Please dont get
the notion that Im askin for pity or anything like that And dont
think Im comparin what I call my fight to the real one like Als
Theres nothin much heroic about me eh No no I guess not Tell that
to look at me eh

Captain Zelotes rose and laid his big hand on his bookkeepers shoulder

Dont you believe it Labe he said Im proud of you    And I
declare Im ashamed of myself    Humph    Well tonight you
come home with me and have supper at the house

Now now Capn Lote

You do as I tell you After supper if theres any walkin to be
doneif you take a notion to frog it to Orham or San Francisco or
somewheresmaybe Ill go with you Walkin may be good for my fight
too you cant tell till you try    There dont argue Labe Im
skipper of this craft yet and youll obey my orders dyou hear

The day following the receipt of the fateful telegram the captain wrote
a brief note to Fletcher Fosdick A day or two later he received a
reply Fosdicks letter was kindly and deeply sympathetic He had been
greatly shocked and grieved by the news


Young Speranza seemed to me he wrote in my one short interview with
him to be a fine young fellow Madeline poor girl is almost frantic
She will recover by and by recovery is easier at her age but it will
be very very hard for you and Mrs Snow You and I little thought when
we discussed the problem of our young people that it would be solved
in this way To you and your wife my sincerest sympathy When you hear
particulars concerning your grandsons death please write me Madeline
is anxious to know and keeps asking for them Mrs Fosdick is too much
concerned with her daughters health to write just now but she joins me
in sympathetic regards


Captain Zelotes took Mrs Fosdicks sympathy with a grain of salt When
he showed this letter to his wife he for the first time told her of
the engagement explaining that his previous silence had been due to
Alberts request that the affair be kept a secret for the present
Olive even in the depth of her sorrow was greatly impressed by the
grandeur of the alliance

Just think Zelotes she exclaimed the Fosdick girland our Albert
engaged to marry her Why the Fosdicks are awful rich everybody says
so Mrs Fosdick is head of I dont know how many societies and clubs
and things in New York her name is in the paper almost every day so
another New York woman told me at Red Cross meetin last summer And Mr
Fosdick has been in politics way up in politics

Umhm Well hes reformed lately I understand so we mustnt hold
that against him

Why Zelotes what DO you mean How can you talk so Just think what it
would have meant to have our Albert marry a girl like Madeline Fosdick

The captain put his arm about her and gently patted her shoulder

There there Mother he said gently dont let that part of it fret
you

But Zelotes tearfully I dont understand It would have been such
a great thing for Albert

Would it Well maybe Anyhow theres no use worryin about it now
Its done withended and done with    same as a good many other
plans thats been made in the world

Zelotes dont speak like that dear so discouraged It makes me
feel worse than ever to hear you Andand he wouldnt want you to Im
sure

Wouldnt he No I callate youre right Mother Well try not to

Other letters came including one from Helen It was not long Mrs Snow
was a little inclined to feel hurt at its brevity Her husband however
did not share this feeling

Have you read it carefully Mother he asked

Of course I have Zelotes What do you mean

I meanwell I tell you Mother Ive read it three time The first
time I was like you seemed to me as good a friend of Al and of us as
Helen Kendall ought to have written more than that The second time I
read it I begun to wonder ifif

If what Zelotes

Oh nothin Mother nothin She says shes comin to see us just as
soon as she can get away for a day or two Shell come and when she
does I callate both you and I are goin to be satisfied

But why didnt she WRITE more Zelotes Thats what I cant
understand

Captain Zelotes tugged at his beard reflectively When I wrote Fosdick
the other day he said I couldnt write more than a couple of pages
I was too upset to do it I couldnt thats all

Yes but you are Alberts grandfather

I know And Helens always    But there Mother dont you worry
about Helen Kendall Ive known her since she was born pretty nigh and
_I_ tell you shes all RIGHT

Fosdick in his letter had asked for particulars concerning Alberts
death Those particulars were slow in coming Captain Zelotes wrote
at once to the War Department but received little satisfaction The
Department would inform him as soon as it obtained the information The
name of Sergeant Albert Speranza had been cabled as one of a list of
fatalities that was all

And to think as Rachel Ellis put it that we never knew that hed
been made a sergeant until after he was gone He never had time to write
it I expect likely poor boy

The first bit of additional information was furnished by the press A
correspondent of one of the Boston dailies sent a brief dispatch to his
paper describing the fighting at a certain point on the Allied front A
small detachment of American troops had taken part with the French
in an attack on a village held by the enemy The enthusiastic reporter
declared it to be one of the smartest little actions in which our
soldiers had so far taken part and was eloquent concerning the bravery
and dash of his fellow countrymen They proved themselves he went
on and French officers with whom I have talked are enthusiastic Our
losses considering the number engaged are said to be heavy Among
those reported as killed is Sergeant Albert Speranza a Massachusetts
boy whom American readers will remember as a writer of poetry and
magazine fiction Sergeant Speranza is said to have led his company
in the capture of the village and to have acted with distinguished
bravery The editor of the Boston paper who first read this dispatch
turned to his associate at the next desk

Speranza    Speranza he said aloud Say Jim wasnt it Albert
Speranza who wrote that corking poem we published after the Lusitania
was sunk

Jim looked up Yes he said He has written a lot of pretty good
stuff since too Why

Hes just been killed in action over there so Conway says in this
dispatch

So    Humph    Any particulars

Not yet Distinguished bravery according to Conway Couldnt we have
something done in the way of a Sunday special He was a Massachusetts
fellow

We might We havent a photograph have we If we havent perhaps we
can get one

The photograph was obtainedbribery and corruption of the Orham
photographerand accompanied by a reprint of the Lusitania poem
appeared in the Magazine Section of the Sunday newspaper With these
also appeared a short notice of the young poets death in the service of
his country

That was the beginning At the middle of that week Conway sent another
dispatch The editor who received it took it into the office of the
Sunday editor

Say he said here are more particulars about that young chap
Speranza the one we printed the special about last Sunday He must have
been a corker When his lieutenant was put out of business by a shrapnel
this Speranza chap rallied the men and jammed em through the Huns like
a hot knife through butter Killed the German officer and took three
prisoners all by himself Carried his wounded lieutenant to the rear
on his shoulders too Then he went back into the ruins to get another
wounded man and was blown to slivers by a hand grenade Hes been cited
in orders and will probably be decorated by the Frenchthat is
his memory will be Pretty good for a poet Id say No lilies and
languors about that eh

The Sunday editor nodded approval

Great stuff he exclaimed Let me have that dispatch will you when
youve finished Ive just discovered that this young Speranzas father
was Speranza the opera baritone You remember him And his mother was
the daughter of a Cape Cod sea captain Hows that Spain Cape Cod
opera poetry and the Croix de Guerre And have you looked at the young
fellows photograph Combination of Adonis and Romeo where art thou
Ive had no less than twenty letters about him and his poetry already
Next Sunday well have a special as is Where can I get hold of a lot
of his poems

The special as was occupied an entire page A reporter had visited
South Harniss and had taken photographs of the Snow place and some of
its occupants Captain Zelotes had refused to pose but there was a
view of the building and yards of Z Snow and Co with the picturesque
figure of Mr Issachar Price tastefully draped against a pile of boards
in the right foreground Issy had been a find for the reporter he
supplied the latter with every fact concerning Albert which he could
remember and some that he invented on the spur of the moment According
to Issy Albert was a fine fustclass young feller Him and me was
like brothers as you might say When he got into trouble or was
undecided or anything hed come to me for advice and I always gave it
to him Land yes I always give to Albert No matter how busy I was I
always stopped work to help HIM out The reporter added that Mr Price
stopped work even while speaking of it

The special attracted the notice of other newspaper editors This
skirmish in which Albert had taken so gallant part was among the first
in which our soldiers had participated So the story was copied and
recopied The tale of the death of the young poet the happy warrior
as some writer called him was spread from the Atlantic to the Pacific
and from Canada to the Gulf And just at this psychological moment the
New York publisher brought out the long deferred volume The Lances of
Dawn Being the Collected Poems of Albert M C Speranza such was its
title

Meanwhile or rather within the week when the Lances of Dawn flashed
upon the public Captain Zelotes received a letter from the captain of
Alberts regiment in France It was not a long letter for the captain
was a busy man but it was the kindly sympathetic letter of one who
was literally that welladvertised combination an officer and a
gentleman It told of Alberts promotion to the rank of sergeant a
promotion which had the boy been spared would I am sure have been
the forerunner of others It told of that last fight the struggle for
the village of Sergeant Speranzas coolness and daring and of his rush
back into the throat of death to save a wounded comrade


The men tell me they tried to stop him wrote the captain He was
himself slightly wounded he had just brought Lieutenant Stacey back
to safety and the enemy at that moment was again advancing through the
village But he insisted upon going The man he was trying to rescue was
a private in his company and the pair were great friends So he started
back alone although several followed him a moment later They saw him
enter the ruined cottage where his friend lay Then a party of the
enemy appeared at the corner and flung grenades The entire side of the
cottage which he had just entered was blown in and the Germans passed on
over it causing our men to fall back temporarily We retook the place
within half an hour Private Kellys bodyit was Private Kelly whom
Sergeant Speranza was attempting to rescuewas found and another badly
disfigured which was at first supposed to be that of your grandson But
this body was subsequently identified as that of a private named Hamlin
who was killed when the enemy first charged Sergeant Speranzas body
is still missing but is thought to be buried beneath the ruins of the
cottage These ruins were subsequently blown into further chaos by a
high explosive shell


Then followed more expressions of regret and sympathy and confirmation
of the report concerning citation and the war cross Captain Lote read
the letter at first alone in his private office Then he brought it
home and gave it to his wife to read Afterward he read it aloud to Mrs
Ellis and to Laban who was making his usual call in the Snow kitchen

When the reading was ended Labe was the first to speak His eyes were
shining

Godfreys he exclaimed Godfreys Capn Lote

The captain seemed to understand

Youre right Labe he said The boys made us proud of him   
Prouder than some of us are of ourselves I callate he added rising
and moving toward the door

Sho sho Capn you mustnt feel that way No no

Humph    Labe I presume likely if I was a pious man one of the
oldfashioned kind of pious and believed the Almighty went out of his
way to get square with any human bein that made a mistake or didnt do
the right thingif I believed that I might figger all this was a sort
of special judgment on me for my prejudices eh

Mr Keeler was much disturbed

Nonsense nonsense Capn Lote he protested You aint fair to
yourself You never treated Al anyhow but just honest and fair and
square If he was here now instead of layin dead over there in France
poor feller hed say so too Yes he would Course he would

The captain made no reply but walked from the room Laban turned to
Mrs Ellis

The old man broods over that he said I wish    Eh Whats the
matter Rachel What are you lookin at me like that for

The housekeeper was leaning forward in her chair her cheeks flushed and
her hands clenched

How do you know hes dead she asked in a mysterious whisper

Eh How do I know whos dead

Albert How do you know hes dead

Laban stared at her

How do I know hes DEAD he repeated How do I know

Yes yes yes impatiently thats what I said Dont run it over
three or four times more How do you know Alberts dead

Why Rachel what kind of talks that I know hes dead because the
newspapers say so and the War Department folks say so and this capn
man in France that was right there at the time HE says so All hands
say soyes yes So dont

Sh I dont care if they all say so ten times over How do they KNOW
They aint found him dead have they The report from the War Department
folks was sent when they thought that other body was Alberts Now they
know that wasnt him Where is he

Why under the ruins of that cottage Twas all blown to pieces and
most likely

Umhm There you are Most likely Well I aint satisfied with most
likelys I want to KNOW

Butbut

Laban Keeler until they find his body I shant believe Alberts dead

But Rachel you mustnt try to deceive yourself that way Dont you
see

No I dont see Labe when Robert Penfold was lost and gone for all
them months all hands thought he was dead didnt they But he wasnt
he was on that island lost in the middle of all creation Whats to
hinder Albert bein took prisoner by those Germans They came back to
that cottage place after Albert was left there the capn says so in
that letter Capn Lote just read Whats to hinder their carryin Al off
with em Eh Whats to hinder

Whywhy nothin I suppose in one way But nine chances out of
ten

That leaves one chance dont it I aint goin to give up that chance
forfor my boy IIOh Labe I did think SO much of him

I know Rachel I know Dont cry any more than you can help And if
it helps you any to make believeI mean to keep on hopin hes alive
somewhereswhy do it It wont do any harm I suppose Only I wouldnt
hint such a thing to Capn Lote or Olive

Of course not indignantly I aint quite a fool I hope    And I
presume likely youre right Laban The poor boy is dead probably But
IIm goin to hope he isnt anyhow just to get what comfort I can
from it And Robert Penfold did come back you know

For some time Laban found himself against all reason asking the very
question Rachel had asked Did they actually KNOW that Albert was dead
But as the months passed and no news came he ceased to ask it Whenever
he mentioned the subject to the housekeeper her invariable reply was
But they havent found his body have they She would not give up
that tenth chance As she seemed to find some comfort in it he did not
attempt to convince her of its futility

And meanwhile The Lances of Dawn Being the Collected Poems of
Albert M C Speranza was making a mild sensation The critics were
surprisingly kind to it The story of the young authors recent and
romantic death of his gallantry his handsome features displayed in
newspapers everywhere all these helped toward the generous welcome
accorded the little volume If the verses were not inspiredwhy they
were at least entertaining and pleasant And youth highhearted youth
sang on every page So the reviewers were kind and forbearing to the
poems themselves and for the sake of the dead soldierpoet were often
enthusiastic The book sold for a volume of poems it sold very well
indeed

At the Snow place in South Harniss pride and tears mingled Olive read
the verses over and over again and wept as she read Rachel Ellis
learned many of them by heart but she too wept as she recited them to
herself or to Laban In the little bookkeepers room above Simonds shoe
store The Lances of Dawn lay under the lamp upon the center table as
before a shrine Captain Zelotes read the verses Also he read all
the newspaper notices which sent to the family by Helen Kendall
were promptly held before his eyes by Olive and Rachel He read the
publishers advertisements he read the reviews And the more he read
the more puzzled and bewildered he became

I cant understand it Laban he confided in deep distress to Mr
Keeler I give in I dont know anything at all about this Im clean
off soundins If all this newspaper stuff is so Albert was right
all the time and I was plumb wrong Heres this feller picking up a
clipping from the desk callin him a genius and a gifted youth and
the land knows what And every day or so I get a letter from somebody I
never heard of tellin me what a comfort to em those poetry pieces of
his are I dont understand it Labe It worries me If all this is true
thenthen I was all wrong I tried to keep him from makin up poetry
LabeTRIED to I did If what these folks say is so somethin ought
to be done to me IIby thunder I dont knows I hadnt ought to be
hung    And yetand yet I did what I thought was right and did
it for the boys sake    Andand even now II aint sartin I was
wrong But if I wasnt wrong then this is    Oh I dont know I
dont know

And not only in South Harniss were there changes of heart In New York
City and at Greenwich where Mrs Fosdick was more than ever busy with
war work there were changes When the newspaper accounts of young
Speranzas heroic death were first published the lady paid little
attention to them Her daughter needed all her care just thenall the
care that is which she could spare from her duties as president of
this society and corresponding secretary of that If her feelings upon
hearing the news could have been analyzed it is probable that their
larger proportion would have been a huge sense of relief THAT problem
was solved at all events She was sorry for poor Madeline of course
but the dear child was but a child and would recover

But as with more and more intensity the limelight of publicity was
turned upon Albert Speranzas life and death and writing the wife of
the Honorable Fletcher Fosdick could not but be impressed As head of
several socalled literary societies societies rather neglected since
the outbreak of hostilities she had made it her business to hunt
literary lions Recently it was true that military lionsMajor
Vermicelli of the Roumanian light cavalry or Private Drinkwater of the
Tank Corpswere more in demand than Tagores but as Mrs Fosdick read
of Sergeant Speranzas perils and poems it could not help occurring to
her that here was a lion both literary and martial Decidedly she had
not approved of her daughters engagement to that lion but now the said
lion was dead which rendered him a perfectly harmless yet not the
less fascinating animal And then appeared The Lances of Dawn and Mrs
Fosdicks friends among the elect began to read and talk about it

It was then that the change came Those friends one by one individuals
judiciously chosen were told in strict confidence of poor Madelines
romantic love affair and its tragic ending These individuals chosen
judiciously as has been stated whispered also in strict confidence
the tale to other friends and acquaintances Mrs Fosdick began to
receive condolences on her daughters account and on her own Soon she
began to speak publicly of My poor dear daughters dead fiance Such a
loss to American literature Sheer genius Have you read the article in
the Timepiece Madeline poor girl is heartbroken naturally but very
proud even in the midst of her grief So are we all I assure you

She quoted liberally from The Lances of Dawn A copy specially bound
lay upon her library table Alberts photograph in uniform obtained
from the Snows by Mr Fosdick who wrote for it at his wifes request
stood beside it To callers and sister war workers Mrs Fosdick gave
details of the heros genius his bravery his devotion to her daughter
It was all so romantic and pleasantly selfadvertisingand perfectly
safe

Summer came again the summer of 1918 The newspapers now were gravely
personal reading to millions of Americans Our new army was trying
its metal on the French front and with the British against the vaunted
Hindenburg Line The transports were carrying thousands on every trip to
join those already over there In South Harniss and in Greenwich and
New York as in every town and city the ordinary summer vacations and
playtime occupations were forgotten or neglected and war charities and
war labors took their place Other soldiers than Sergeant Speranza were
the newspaper heroes now other books than The Lances of Dawn talked
about

As on the previous summer the new Fosdick cottage was not occupied by
its owners Mrs Fosdick was absorbed by her multitudinous war duties
and her husband was at Washington giving his counsel and labor to
the cause Captain Zelotes bought to his last spare dollar of each
successive issue of Liberty Bonds and gave that dollar to the Red Cross
or the Y M C A Laban and Rachel did likewise Even Issachar Price
bought Thrift Stamps and exhibited them to anyone who would stop long
enough to look

By crimus declared Issy Im makin myself poor helpin out the
govment but let er go and darn the Kaiser thats my motto But they
aint all like me I was down to the drug store yesterday and old
man Burgess had the cheek to tell me I owed him for some cigars I
boughterlast fall seems to me twas I turned right around and
looked at himIve got my opinion says I of a man that thinks of
cigars and such luxuries when the country needs every cent What have
you got that govment poster stuck up on your wall for says I Read
it I says It says Save Save Save dont it All right Thats
what IM doin I AM savin Then when he was thinkin of somethin to
answer back I walked right out and left him Yes sir by crimustee I
left him right where he stood

August came Septemberthe Hindenburg Line was broken Each day the
triumphant headlines in the papers were big and black and also alas
the casualty lists on the inside pages long and longer Then October
The armistice was signed It was the end The Allied world went wild
cheered danced celebrated Then it sat back thinking thanking God
solemnly trying to realize that the killing days the frightful days of
waiting and awful anxiety were over

And early in November another telegram came to the office of Z Snow and
Co This time it came not from the War Department direct but from the
Boston headquarters of the American Red Cross

And this time just as on the day when the other fateful telegram came
Laban Keeler was the first of the office regulars to learn its contents
Ben Kelley himself brought this message just as he had brought that
telling of Albert Speranzas death And the usually stolid Ben was
greatly excited He strode straight from the door to the bookkeepers
desk

Is the old man in Labe he whispered jerking his head toward the
private office the door of which happened to be shut

Laban looked at him over his spectacles Capn Lote you mean he
asked Yes hes in But he dont want to be disturbedno no Goin
to write a couple of important letters he said Important ones   
Umhm What is it Ben Anything I can do for you

Kelley did not answer that question Instead he took a telegram from his
pocket

Read it Labe he whispered Read it Its the darndest
newsthethe darnedest good news ever you heard in your life It dont
seem as if it could he but by time I guess tis Anyhow its from
the Red Cross folks and theyd ought to know

Laban stared at the telegram It was not in the usual envelope Kelley
had been too anxious to bring it to its destination to bother with an
envelope

Read it commanded the operator again See if you think Capn Lote
ought to have it broke easy to him oror what Read it I tell you
Lord sakes its no secret I hollered it right out loud when it come in
over the wire and the gang at the depot heard it They know it and itll
be all over town in ten minutes READ IT

Keeler read the telegram His florid cheeks turned pale

Good Lord above he exclaimed under his breath

Eh I bet you Shall I take it to the capn Eh What do you think

Wait    Wait    IIMy soul My soul Why    Itsits
true    And Rachel always said    Why she was right   
I   

From without came the sound of running feet and a series of yells

Labe Labe shrieked Issy Oh my crimus    Labe

He burst into the office his eyes and mouth wide open and his hands
waving wildly

Labe Labe he shouted again Have you heard it Have you Its true
too Hes alive Hes alive Hes alive

Laban sprang from his stool Shut up Is he commanded Shut up Hold
on Dont

But hes alive I tell you He aint dead He aint never been dead
Oh my crimus    Hey Capn Lote HES ALIVE

Captain Zelotes was standing in the doorway of the private office The
noise had aroused him from his letter writing

Whos alive Whats the matter with you this time Is he demanded

Shut up Issy ordered Laban seizing the frantic Mr Price by the
collar Be still Wait a minute

Be still What do I want to be still for I callate Capn Lotell
holler some too when he hears Hes alive Capn Lote I tell ye Let
go of me Labe Keeler Hes alive

Whos alive What is it Labe YOU answer me Whos alive

Labans thoughts were still in a whirl He was still shaking from the
news the telegraph operator had brought Rachel Ellis was at that moment
in his mind and he answered as she might have done

ErerRobert Penfold he said

Robert PENFOLD What

Issachar could hold in no longer

Robert Penfold nawthin he shouted Who in thunders he Taint
Robert Penfold nor Robert Penholder neither Its Al Speranza thats
who tis He aint killed Capn Lote Hes alive and hes been alive
all the time

Kelley stepped forward

Looks as if twas so Capn Snow he said Heres the telegram from
the Red Cross



CHAPTER XV


There was nothing miraculous about it That is to say it was no more of
a miracle than hundreds of similar cases in the World War The papers of
those years were constantly printing stories of men over whose supposed
graves funeral sermons had been preached to whose heirs insurance
payments had been made in whose memory grateful communities had made
speeches and delivered eulogiumsthe papers were telling of instance
after instance of those men being discovered alive and in the flesh as
casuals in some French hospital or as inmates of German prison camps

Rachel Ellis had asked what was to hinder Alberts having been taken
prisoner by the Germans and carried off by them As a matter of fact
nothing had hindered and that was exactly what had happened Sergeant
Speranza wounded by machine gun fire and again by the explosion of the
grenade was found in the ruins of the cottage when the detachment of
the enemy captured it He was conscious and able to speak so instead
of being bayonetted was carried to the rear where he might be questioned
concerning the American forces The questioning was most unsatisfactory
to the Prussian officers who conducted it Albert fainted recovered
consciousness and fainted again So at last the Yankee swine was left
to die or get well and his Prussian interrogators went about other
business the business of escaping capture themselves But when they
retreated the few prisoners mostly wounded men were taken with them

Alberts recollections of the next few days were hazy and very doubtful
Pain pain and more pain Hours and hoursthey seemed like yearsof
jolting over rough roads Pawingover by a fat bearded surgeon who
may not have been intentionally brutal but quite as likely may A great
desire to die punctuated by occasional feeble spurts of wishing to
live Then more surgical manhandling more joltingin freight cars
this timea slow miserable recovery nurses who hated their patients
and treated them as if they did then a prison camp a German prison
camp Then horrors and starvation and brutality lasting many months
Then fever

He was wandering in that misty land between this world and the
next when the armistice having been signed an American Red Cross
representative found him In the interval between fits of delirium
he told this man his name and regiment and later the name of his
grandparents When it seemed sure that he was to recover the Red Cross
representative cabled the facts to this country And still later those
facts or the allimportant fact that Sergeant Albert M C Speranza was
not dead but alive came by telegraph to Captain Zelotes Snow of South
Harniss And two months after that Captain Zelotes himself standing
on the wharf in Boston and peering up at a crowded deck above him saw
the face of his grandson that face which he had never expected to see
again looking eagerly down upon him

A few more weeks and it was over The brief interval of camp life and
the mustering out were things of the past Captain Lote and Albert
seated in the train were on their way down the Cape bound home Home
The word had a significance now which it never had before Home

Albert drew a long breath By George he exclaimed By George
Grandfather this looks good to me

It might not have looked as good to another person It was raining the
long stretches of salt marsh were windswept and brown and bleak In the
distance Cape Cod Bay showed gray and white against a leaden sky The
drops ran down the dingy car windows

Captain Zelotes understood however He nodded

It used to look good to me when I was bound home after a vyage he
observed Well son I callate your grandma and Rachel are up to the
depot by this time waitin for you We aint due for pretty nigh an hour
yet but Id be willin to bet theyre there

Albert smiled My I do want to see them he said

Shouldnt wonder a mite if they wanted to see you boy Well Im kind
of glad I shooed that reception committee out of the way I presumed
likely youd rather have your first day home to yourselfand us

I should say so Newspaper reporters are a lot of mighty good fellows
but I hope I never see another one    Thats rather ungrateful I
know he added with a smile but I mean itjust now

He had some excuse for meaning it The death of Albert Speranza poet
and warrior had made a newspaper sensation His resurrection and return
furnished material for another Captain Zelotes was not the only person
to meet the transport at the pier a delegation of reporters was there
also Photographs of Sergeant Speranza appeared once more in print This
time however they were snapshots showing him in uniform likenesses
of a still handsome but less boyish young man thinner a scar upon
his right cheek and the look in his eyes more serious and infinitely
older the look of one who had borne much and seen more The reporters
found it difficult to get a story from the returned hero He seemed to
shun the limelight and to be almost unduly modest and retiring which
was of itself had they but known it a transformation sufficiently
marvelous to have warranted a special Sunday special

Will not talk about himself so one writer headed his article Gertie
Kendrick with a brandnew ring upon her engagement finger sniffed as
she read that headline to Sam Thatcher who had purchased the ring Al
Speranza wont talk about himself exclaimed Gertie Well its the
FIRST time then No wonder they put it in the paper

But Albert would not talk claiming that he had done nothing worth
talking about except to get himself taken prisoner in almost his first
engagement Go and ask some of the other fellows aboard here he
urged They have been all through it As he would not talk the
newspaper men were obliged to talk for him which they did by describing
his appearance and his manner and by rehashing the story of the fight
in the French village Also of course they republished some of his
verses The Lances of Dawn appeared in a special edition in honor of its
authors reappearance on this earth

Yes sir continued Captain Zelotes the reception committee was
considerble disappointed Theyd have met you with the Orham band if
theyd had their way I told em youd heard all the band music you
wanted in camp I guessed likely and youd rather come home quiet
There was goin to be some speeches too but I had them put off

Thanks Grandfather

Umhm I had a notion you wouldnt hanker for speeches If you do
Issyll make one for you most any time Ever since you got into the
papers Issys been swellin up like a hot popover with pride because
you and he was what he calls chummies All last summer Issachar spent
his evenins hangin around the hotel waitin for the next boarder to
mention your name Sure as one did Is was ready for him Know him
hed sing out Did I know Al Speranza ME Well now say And so on
long as the feller would listen I asked him once if he ever told any of
em how you ducked him with the bucket of water He didnt think I knew
about that and it kind of surprised him I judged

Albert smiled Laban told you about it I suppose he said What a
kid trick that was wasnt it

The captain turned his head and regarded him for an instant The old
twinkle was in his eye when he spoke

Wouldnt do a thing like that now Al I presume likely he said
Feel a good deal older now eh

Alberts answer was seriously given

Sometimes I feel at least a hundred and fifty he replied

Humph    Well I wouldnt feel like that If youre a hundred and
fifty I must be a little older than Methuselah was in his last years
Im feelin younger today younger than I have for quite a spell Yes
for quite a spell

His grandson put a hand on his knee Good for you Grandfather he
said Now tell me more about Labe Do you know I think the old chaps
sticking by his pledge is the bulliest thing Ive heard since Ive been
home

So they talked of Laban and of Rachel and of South Harniss happenings
until the train drew up at the platform of that station And upon that
platform stepped Albert to feel his grandmothers arms about him and her
voice tremulous with happiness at his ear And behind her loomed Mrs
Ellis her ample face a combination of smiles and tears all sunshine
and fair weather down below but rainin steady up aloft as Captain
Lote described it afterwards And behind her like a foothill in
the shadow of a mountain was Laban And behind LabanNo that is a
mistakein front of Laban and beside Laban and in front of and beside
everyone else when opportunity presented was Issachar And Issachars
expression and bearings were wonderful to see A stranger and there
were several strangers amid the group at the station might have gained
the impression that Mr Price with of course a very little help from
the Almighty was responsible for everything

Why Issy exclaimed Albert when they shook hands Youre here too
eh

Mr Prices already protuberant chest swelled still further His reply
had the calmness of finality

Yes sir said Issy Im here Whos goin to look out for Z Snow
and Co if all hands walks out and leaves em Labe says I dont
know says I and I dont care Im goin to that depot to meet Al
Speranzy and if Z Snow and Co goes to pot while Im gone I cant help
it I have sacrificed I says and I stand ready to sacrifice pretty
nigh everything for my business but theres limits and this is one of
em Im goin acrost to that depot to meet him says I and dont you
try to stop me Labe Keeler

Great stuff Is said Albert with a laugh What did Labe say to
that

What was there for him to say He could see I meant it Course he hove
out some of his cheap talk but it didnt amount to nothin Asked if I
want goin to put up a sign sayin when Id be back sos to ease the
customers minds I dont know when Ill be back I says All right
says he put that on the sign Thatll ease em still more Just cheap
talk twas He thinks hes funny but I dont pay no attention to him

Others came to shake hands and voice a welcome The formal reception
that with the band had been called off at Captain Zelotess request
but the informal one was in spite of the rain which was now much less
heavy quite a sizable gathering

The Reverend Mr Kendall held his hand for a long time and talked much
it seemed to Albert that he had aged greatly since they last met He
wandered a bit in his remarks and repeated himself several times

The poor old gentlemans failin a good deal Albert said Mrs Snow
as they drove home together he and his grandparents three on the
seat of the buggy behind Jessamine His sermons are pretty tiresome
nowadays but we put up with em because hes been with us so long   
Aint you squeezed most to death Albert You two big men and me all
mashed together on this narrow seat Its lucky Im small Zelotes ought
to get a twoseated carriage but he wont

Next thing I get Mother observed the captain will be an
automobile Ill stick to the old mare here as long as shes able to
navigate but when she has to be hauled out of commission Im goin
to buy a car I believe Im pretty nigh the last man in this county
to drive a horse as tis Makes me feel like what Sol Dadgett calls
a cracked teapota genuine antique One of these city women will be
collectin me some of these days Better look out mother

Olive sighed happily It does me good to hear you joke again
Zelotes she said He didnt joke much Albert whilewhen we thought
youyou

Albert interrupted in time to prevent the threatened shower

So Mr Kendall is not well he said Im very sorry to hear it

Of course you would be You and he used to be so friendly when Helen
was home Oh speakin of Helen she IS comin home in a fortnit or
three weeks so I hear Shes goin to give up her teachin and come
back to be company for her father I suppose she realizes he needs her
but it must be a big sacrifice for her givin up the good position
shes got now Shes such a smart girl and such a nice one Why she
came to see us after the news camethe bad newsand she was so kind
and so good I dont know what we should have done without her Zelotes
says so too dont you Zelotes

Her husband did not answer Instead he said Well theres home Al
Rachels there ahead of us and dinners on the way judgin by the smoke
from the kitchen chimney How does the old place look to you boy

Albert merely shook his head and drew a long breath but his
grandparents seemed to be quite satisfied

There were letters and telegrams awaiting him on the table in the
sittingroom Two of the letters were postmarked from a town on the
Florida coast The telegram also was from that same town

_I_ had one of those things observed Captain Zelotes alluding to
the telegram Fosdick sent me one of those long ones nightletters
I believe they call em He wants me to tell you that Mrs Fosdick is
better and that they callate to be in New York before very long and
shall expect you there Of course you knew that Al but I presume
likely the main idea of the telegram was to help say Welcome home to
you thats all

Albert nodded Madeline and her mother had been in Florida all winter
Mrs Fosdicks health was not good She declared that her nerves had
given way under her frightful responsibilities during the war There
was although it seems almost sacrilege to make such a statement a
certain similarity between Mrs Fletcher Fosdick and Issachar Price The
telegram was as his grandfather surmised an expression of welcome and
of regret that the senders could not be there to share in the reception
The two letters which accompanied it he put in his pocket to read later
on when alone Somehow he felt that the first hours in the old
house belonged exclusively to his grandparents Everything else even
Madelines letters must take second place for that period

Dinner was to say the least an ample meal Rachel and Olive had as
Captain Lote said laid themselves out on that dinner It began well
and continued well and ended best of all for the dessert was one of
which Albert was especially fond They kept pressing him to eat until
Laban who was an invited guest was moved to comment

Humph observed Mr Keeler I knew twas the reglar program to
kill the fatted calf when the prodigal got home but I see now its the
proper caper to fat up the prodigal to take the critters place No no
Rachel Id like fustrate to eat another bushel or so to please you
but somethinthat still small voice were always readin about or
somethinseems to tell me twouldnt be good jedgment    Umhm
   Twouldnt be good jedgment    Callate its right too   
Yes yes yes

Now Capn Lote he added as they rose from the table you stay
right to home here for the rest of the day Ill hustle back to the
office and see if Issys importance has bust his biler for him
Solong Al See you pretty soon Got some things to talk about you and
I have    Yes yes

Later when Rachel was in the kitchen with the dishes Olive left the
sitting room and reappeared with triumph written large upon her face In
one hand she held a mysterious envelope and in the other a book Albert
recognized that book It was his own The Lances of Dawn It was
no novelty to him When first the outside world and he had reopened
communication copies of that book had been sent him His publisher
had sent them Madeline had sent them his grandparents had sent them
comrades had sent them nurses and doctors and newspaper men had brought
them No The Lances of Dawn was not a novelty to its author But he
wondered what was in the envelope

Mrs Snow enlightened him You sit right down now Albert she said
Sit right down and listen because Ive got somethin to tell you Yes
and somethin to show you too Here Stop now Zelotes You cant run
away Youve got to sit down and look on and listen too

Captain Zelotes smiled resignedly There was or so it seemed to his
grandson an odd expression on his face He looked pleased but not
altogether pleased However he obeyed his wifes orders and sat

Stop look and listen he observed Mother you sound like a railroad
crossin All right here I am Al the society of What did I tell you
is goin to have a meetin

His wife nodded Well she said triumphantly what DID I tell you
Wasnt I right

The captain pulled his beard and nodded

Right as right could be Mother he admitted Your figgers was a
few hundred thousand out of the way maybe but barrin that you was
perfectly right

Well Im glad to hear you say so for once in your life Albert
holding up the envelope do you know what this is

Albert much puzzled admitted that he did not His grandmother put down
the book opened the envelope and took from it a slip of paper

And can you guess what THIS is she asked Albert could not guess

Its a check thats what it is Its the first six months royalties
thats what they call em on that beautiful book of yours And how much
do you suppose tis

Albert shook his head Twentyfive dollars he suggested jokingly

Twentyfive dollars Its over twentyfive HUNDRED dollars Its
twentyeight hundred and fortythree dollars and sixtyfive cents
thats what it is Think of it Almost three thousand dollars And
Zelotes prophesied that twouldnt be more than

Her husband held up his hand Shsh Shsh Mother he said Dont
get started on what I prophesied or we wont be through till doomsday
Ill give in right off that Im the worst prophet since the feller that
histed the Fair and Dry signal the day afore Noahs flood begun You
see he explained turning to Albert your grandma figgered out that
youd probably clear about half a million on that book of poetry Al I
callated twant likely to be much moren a couple of hundred thousand
so

Why Zelotes Snow You said

Yes yes So I did Mother so I did You was right and I was wrong
Twentyeight hundred aint exactly a million Al but its a darn sight
more than I ever callated youd make from that book Or most anybody
else ever made from any book furs that goes he added with a shake
of the head I declare II dont understand it yet And a poetry
book too Who in time BUYS em all Eh

Albert was looking at the check and the royalty statement

So this is why I couldnt get any satisfaction from the publisher he
observed I wrote him two or three times about my royalties and he put
me off each time I began to think there werent any

Captain Zelotes smiled Thats your grandmas doins he observed
The check came to us a good while ago when we thought you
waswaswell when we thought

Yes Surely I understand put in Albert to help him out

Yes Thats when twas And Mother she was so proud of it because
youd earned it Al that she kept it and kept it showin it to all
hands andand so on And then when we found out you wasntthat youd
be home some time or otherwhy then she wouldnt let me put it in the
bank for you because she wanted to give it to you herself Thats what
she said was the reason I presume likely the real one was that
she wanted to flap it in my face every time she crowed over my bad
prophesyin which was about three times a day and four on Sundays

Zelotes Snow the idea

All right Mother all right Anyhow she got me to write your
publisher man and ask him not to give you any satisfaction about those
royalties sos she could be the fust one to paralyze you with em
And with a frank outburst if you aint paralyzed Al I own up that
_I_ am Three thousand poetry profits beats me _I_ dont understand
it

His wife sniffed Of course you dont she declared But Albert does
And so do I only I think it ought to have been ever and ever so much
more Dont you yourself Albert

The author of The Lances of Dawn was still looking at the statement of
its earnings

Approximately eighteen thousand sold at fifteen cents royalty he
observed Humph Well Ill be hanged

But you said it would be twentyfive cents not fifteen protested
Olive In your letter when the book was first talked about you said
so

Albert smiled Did I he observed Well I said a good many things
in those days Im afraid Fifteen cents for a first book especially a
book of verse is fair enough I guess But eighteen thousand SOLD That
is what gets me

You mean you think it ought to be a lot more So do I Albert and so
does Rachel Why we like it a lot better than we do David Harum That
was a nice book but it wasnt lovely poetry like yours And David
Harum sold a million Why shouldnt yours sell as many Only eighteen
thousandwhy are you lookin at me so funny

Her grandson rose to his feet Lets let well enough alone
Grandmother he said Eighteen thousand will do thank you Im like
Grandfather Im wondering who on earth bought them

Mrs Snow was surprised and a little troubled

Why Albert she said you act kind ofkind of queer seems to me
You talk as if your poetry wasnt beautiful You know it is You used to
say it was yourself

He interrupted her Did I Grandmother he said All right then
probably I did Lets walk about the old place a little I want to see
it all By George Ive been dreaming about it long enough

There were callers that afternoon friends among the townsfolk and more
still after supper It was latelate for South Harniss that iswhen
Albert standing in the doorway of the bedroom he nor they had ever
expected he would occupy again bade his grandparents good night Olive
kissed him again and again and speech failing her hastened away down
the hall Captain Zelotes shook his hand opened his mouth to speak
shut it again repeated both operations and at last with a brief
Well good night Al hurried after his wife Albert closed the door
put his lamp upon the bureau and sat down in the big rocker

In a way the night was similar to that upon which he had first entered
that room It had ceased raining but the wind as on that first night
was howling and whining about the eaves the shutters rattled and the
old house creaked and groaned rheumatically It was not as cold as
on that occasion though by no means warm He remembered how bare and
comfortless he had thought the room Now it looked almost luxurious And
he had been homesick or fancied himself in that condition Compared
to the homesickness he had known during the past eighteen months that
youthful seizure seemed contemptible and quite without excuse He looked
about the room again looked long and lovingly Then with a sigh of
content drew from his pocket the two letters which had lain upon the
sittingroom table when he arrived opened them and began to read

Madeline wrote as always vivaciously and at length The maternal
censorship having been removed she wrote exactly as she felt She could
scarcely believe he was really going to be at home when he received
this at home in dear quaint queer old South Harniss Just think
she had not seen the place for ever and ever so long not for over two
years How were all the funny odd people who lived there all the time
Did he remember how he and she used to go to church every Sunday and sit
through those dreadful DREADFUL sermons by that prosy old minister
just as an excuse for meeting each other afterward She was SO sorry she
could not have been there to welcome her hero when he stepped from the
train If it hadnt been for Mothers poor nerves she surely would have
been He knew it didnt he Of course he did But she should see him
soon because Mother is planning already to come back to New York in a
few weeks and then you are to run over immediately and make us a LONG
visit And I shall be so PROUD of you There are lots of Army fellows
down here now officers for the most part So we dance and are very
gaythat is the other girls are I being an engaged young lady am
very circumspect and demure of course Mother carries The Lances about
with her wherever she goes to teas and such things and reads aloud
from it often Captain Blanchard he is one of the familys officer
friends is crazy about your poetry dear He thinks it WONDERFUL You
know what _I_ think of it dont you and when I think that _I_ actually
helped you or played at helping you write some of it

And I am WILD to see your war cross Some of the officers here have
themthe crosses I meanbut not many Captain Blanchard has the
military medal and he is almost as modest about it as you are about
your decoration I dont see how you CAN be so modest If _I_ had a
Croix de Guerre I should want EVERY ONE to know about it At the tea
dance the other afternoon there was a British major who

And so on The second letter was really a continuation of the first
Albert read them both and after the reading was finished sat for some
time in the rocking chair quite regardless of the time and the cold
thinking He took from his pocketbook a photograph one which Madeline
had sent him months before which had reached him while he lay in the
French hospital after his removal from the German camp He looked at
the pretty face in the photograph She looked just as he remembered her
almost exactly as she had looked more than two years before smiling
charming carefree She had not apparently grown older those agelong
months had not changed her He rose and regarded his own reflection in
the mirror of the bureau He was surprised as he was constantly being
surprised to see that he too had not changed greatly in personal
appearance

He walked about the room His grandmother had told him that his room was
just as he had left it I wouldnt change it Albert she said
even when we thought youyou wasnt comin back I couldnt touch it
somehow I kept thinkin Some day I will Pretty soon I MUST But I
never did and now Im so glad

He wandered back to the bureau and pulled open the upper drawers In
those drawers were so many things things which he had kept there
either deliberately or because he was too indolent to destroy them Old
dance cards invitations and a bundle of photographs snapshots He
removed the rubber band from the bundle and stood looking them over
Photographs of school fellows of picnic groups of girls Sam Thatcher
Gertie Kendrickand Helen Kendall There were at least a dozen of
Helen

One in particular was very good From that photograph the face of
Helen as he had known it four years before looked straight up into
hiscleareyed honest a hint of humor and understanding and
commonsense in the gaze and at the corners of the lips He looked at
the photograph and the photograph looked up at him He had not seen
her for so long a time He wondered if the war had changed her as it had
changed him Somehow he hoped it had not Change did not seem necessary
in her case

There had been no correspondence between them since her letter written
when she heard of his enlistment He had not replied to that because
he knew Madeline would not wish him to do so He wondered if she ever
thought of him now if she remembered their adventure at High Point
light He had thought of her often enough In those days and nights of
horror in the prison camp and hospital he had found a little relief a
little solace in lying with closed eyes and summoning back from memory
the things of home and the faces of home And her face had been one of
these Her face and those of his grandparents and Rachel and Laban and
visions of the old house and the roomsthey were the substantial things
to cling to and he had clung to them They WERE home Madelineah yes
he had longed for her and dreamed of her God knew but Madeline of
course was different

He snapped the rubber band once more about the bundle of photographs
closed the drawer and prepared for bed

For the two weeks following his return home he had a thoroughly good
time It was a tremendous comfort to get up when he pleased to eat the
things he liked to do much or little or nothing at his own sweet will
He walked a good deal tramping along the beach in the blustering wind
and chilly sunshine and enjoying every breath of the clean salt air He
thought much during those solitary walks and at times at home in the
evenings he would fall to musing and sit silent for long periods His
grandmother was troubled

Dont it seem to you Zelotes she asked her husband as if Albert
was kind of discontented or unsatisfied these days Hes soso sort
of fidgety Talks like the very mischief for ten minutes and then dont
speak for half an hour Sits still for a long stretch and then jumps up
and starts off walkin as if he was crazy What makes him act so Hes
kind of changed from what he used to be Dont you think so

The captain patted her shoulder Dont worry Mother he said Als
older than he was and what hes been through has made him older still
As for the fidgety part of it the settin down and jumpin up and all
that thats the way they all act so far as I can learn Elisha Warren
over to South Denboro tells me his nephew has been that way ever since
he got back Dont fret Mother Al will come round all right

I didnt know but he might be anxious to seeto see her you know

Her Oh you mean the Fosdick girl Well hell be goin to see her
pretty soon I presume likely Theyre due back in New York most any
time now I believe    Oh hum Why in time couldnt he

Couldnt he what Zelotes

Oh nothin nothin

The summons came only a day after this conversation It came in the form
of another letter from Madeline and one from Mrs Fosdick They were so
the latter wrote back once more in their city home her nerves thank
Heaven were quite strong again and they were expecting him Albert to
come on at once We are all dying to see you wrote Mrs Fosdick And
poor dear Madeline of course is counting the moments

Stay as long as you feel like Al said the captain when told of the
proposed visit Its the dull season at the office anyhow and Labe
and I can get along firstrate with Issy to superintend Stay as long
as you want to only

Only what Grandfather

Only dont want to stay too long That is dont fall in love with New
York so hard that you forget there is such a place as South Harniss

Albert smiled Ive been in places farther away than New York he
said and I never forgot South Harniss

Umhm    Well I shouldnt be surprised if that was so But youll
have better company in New York than you did in some of those places
Give my regards to Fosdick Solong Al



CHAPTER XVI


The Fosdick car was at the Grand Central Station when the Knickerbocker
Limited pulled in And Madeline a wonderfully furred and veiled and
hatted Madeline was waiting there behind the rail as he came up the
runway from the train It was amazing the fact that it was really she
It was more amazing still to kiss her there in public to hold her hand
without fear that some one might see To

Shall I take your bags sir

It was the Fosdick footman who asked it Albert started guiltily Then
he laughed realizing that the handholding and the rest were no longer
criminal offenses He surrendered his luggage to the man A few minutes
later he and Madeline were in the limousine which was moving rapidly
up the Avenue And Madeline was asking questions and he was answering
andand still it was all a dream It COULDNT be real

It was even more like a dream when the limousine drew up before the door
of the Fosdick home and they entered that home together For there was
Mrs Fosdick as ever majestic commanding aweinspiring the same Mrs
Fosdick who had in her letter to his grandfather written him down a
despicable underhanded sneak here was that same Mrs Fosdickbut not
at all the same For this lady was smiling and gracious welcoming him
to her home addressing him by his Christian name treating him kindly
with almost motherly tenderness Madelines letters and Mrs Fosdicks
own letters received during his convalescence abroad had prepared him
or so he had thought for some such change Now he realized that he had
not been prepared at all The reality was so much more revolutionary
than the anticipation that he simply could not believe it

But it was not so very wonderful if he had known all the facts and had
been in a frame of mind to calmly analyze them Mrs Fletcher Fosdick
was a seasoned veteran a general who had planned and fought many
hard campaigns upon the political battlegrounds of womens clubs and
societies of various sorts From the majority of those campaigns she had
emerged victorious but her experiences in defeat had taught her that
the next best thing to winning is to lose gracefully because by
so doing much which appears to be lost may be regained For Albert
Speranza bookkeeper and wouldbe poet of South Harniss Cape Cod
she had had no use whatever as a prospective soninlaw Even toward a
living Albert Speranza hero and newspapermade genius she might have
been cold But when that hero and genius was as she and every one else
supposed safely and satisfactorily dead and out of the way she had
seized the opportunity to bask in the radiance of his memory She had
talked Albert Speranza and read Albert Speranza and boasted of Albert
Speranzas engagement to her daughter before the world Now that the
said Albert Speranza had been inconsiderate enough to come alive
again there was but one thing for her to dothat is to make the best
of it And when Mrs Fletcher Fosdick made the best of anything she made
the very best

It doesnt make any difference she told her husband whether he
really is a genius or whether he isnt We have said he is and now
we must keep on saying it And if he cant earn his salt by his
writingswhich he probably cantthen you must fix it in some way so
that he can makebelieve earn it by something else He is engaged to
Madeline and we have told every one that he is so he will have to
marry her at least I see no way to prevent it

Humph grunted Fosdick And after that Ill have to support them I
suppose

Probablyunless you want your only child to starve

Well I must say Henrietta

You neednt for there is nothing more TO say Were in it and whether
we like it or not we must make the best of it To do anything now
except appear joyful about it would be to make ourselves perfectly
ridiculous We cant do that and you know it

Her husband still looked everything but contented

So far as the young fellow himself goes he said I like him rather
Ive talked with him only once of course and then he and I werent
agreeing exactly But I liked him nevertheless If he were anything but
a fool poet I should be more reconciled

He was snubbed immediately THAT declared Mrs Fosdick with
decision is the only thing that makes him possible

So Mrs Fosdicks welcome was wholehanded if not wholehearted And her
husbands also was cordial and intimate The only member of the Fosdick
household who did not regard the guest with favor was Googoo That
aristocratic bullpup was still irreconcilably hostile When Albert
attempted to pet him he appeared to be planning to devour the caressing
hand and when rebuked by his mistress retired beneath a davenport
growling ominously Even when ignominiously expelled from the room he
growled and cast longing backward glances at the Speranza ankles No
Googoo did not dissemble Albert was perfectly sure of his standing in
Googoos estimation

Dinner that evening was a trifle more formal than he had expected and
he was obliged to apologize for the limitations of his wardrobe His
dress suit of former days he had found much too dilapidated for use
Besides he had outgrown it

I thought I was thinner he said and I think I am But I must have
broadened a bit At any rate all the coats I left behind wont do at
all I shall have to do what Captain Snow my grandfather calls refit
here in New York In a day or two I hope to be more presentable

Mrs Fosdick assured him that it was quite all right really Madeline
asked why he didnt wear his uniform I was dying to see you in it
she said Just think I never have

Albert laughed You have been spared he told her Mine was not a
triumph so far as fit was concerned Of course I had a complete new
rig when I came out of the hospital but even that was not beautiful
It puckered where it should have bulged and bulged where it should have
been smooth

Madeline professed not to believe him

Nonsense she declared I dont believe it Why almost all the
fellows I know have been in uniform for the past two years and theirs
fitted beautifully

But they were officers werent they and their uniforms were custom
made

Why I suppose so Arent all uniforms custom made

Her father laughed Scarcely Maddie he said The privates have
their custommade by the mile and cut off in chunks for the individual
That was about it wasnt it Speranza

Just about sir

Mrs Fosdick evidently thought that the conversation was taking a rather
low tone She elevated it by asking what his thoughts were when taken
prisoner by the Germans He looked puzzled

Thoughts Mrs Fosdick he repeated I dont know that I understand
exactly I was only partly conscious and in a good deal of pain and my
thoughts were rather incoherent Im afraid

But when you regained consciousness you know What were your thoughts
then Did you realize that you had made the great sacrifice for your
country Risked your life and forfeited your liberty and all that for
the cause Wasnt it a great satisfaction to feel that you had done
that

Alberts laugh was hearty and unaffected Why no he said I think
what I was realizing most just then was that I had made a miserable mess
of the whole business Failed in doing what I set out to do and been
taken prisoner besides I remember thinking when I was clearheaded
enough to think anything You fool you spent months getting into this
war and then got yourself out of it in fifteen minutes And it WAS a
silly trick too

Madeline was horrified

What DO you mean she cried Your going back there to rescue your
comrade a silly trick The very thing that won you your Croix de
Guerre

Why yes in a way I didnt save Mike poor fellow

Mike Was his name Mike

Yes Michael Francis Xavier Kelly A South Boston Mick he was and one
of the finest squarest boys that ever drew breath Well poor Mike was
dead when I got to him so my trip had been for nothing and if he had
been alive I could not have prevented his being taken As it was he
was dead and I was a prisoner So nothing was gained and for me
personally a good deal was lost It wasnt a brilliant thing to do
But he added apologetically a chap doesnt have time to think
collectively in such a scrape And it was my first real scrap and I was
frightened half to death besides

Frightened Why I never heard anything so ridiculous What

One moment Madeline It was Mrs Fosdick who interrupted I want
to askerAlbert a question I want to ask him if during his long
imprisonment he composedwrote you know I should have thought the
sights and experiences would have forced one to express ones selfthat
is one to whom the gift of expression was so generously granted she
added with a gracious nod

Albert hesitated

Why at first I did he said When I first was well enough to think
I used to try to writeverses I wrote a good many Afterwards I tore
them up

Tore them up Both Mrs and Miss Fosdick uttered this exclamation

Why yes You see they were such rot The things I wanted to write
about the things _I_ had seen and was seeing thethe fellows like
Mike and their pluck and all thatwell it was all too big for me
to tackle My jingles sounded when I read them over like tunes on a
street piano _I_ couldnt do it A genius might have been equal to the
job but I wasnt

Mrs Fosdick glanced at her husband There was something of alarmed
apprehension in the glance Madelines next remark covered the
situation It expressed the absolute truth so much more of the truth
than even the young lady herself realized at the time

Why Albert Speranza she exclaimed I never heard you speak of
yourself and your work in that way before AlwaysALWAYS you have had
such complete such splendid confidence in yourself You were never
afraid to attempt ANYTHING You MUST not talk so Dont you intend to
write any more

Albert looked at her Oh yes indeed he said simply That is just
what I do intend to door try to do

That evening alone in the library he and Madeline had their first
long intimate talk the first since those daysto him they seemed as
far away as the last centurywhen they walked the South Harniss beach
together walked beneath the rainbows and dreamed And now here was
their dream coming true

Madeline he was realizing it as he looked at her was prettier than
ever She had grown a little older of course a little more mature but
surprisingly little She was still a girl a very very pretty girl and
a charming girl And he

What are you thinking about she demanded suddenly

He came to himself I was thinking about you he said You are just
as you used to be just as charming and just as sweet You havent
changed

She smiled and then pouted

I dont know whether to like that or not she said Did you expect to
find me lesscharming and the rest

Why no of course not That was clumsy on my part What I meant was
thatwell it seems ages centuries since we were together there on
the Capeand yet you have not changed

She regarded him reflectively

You have she said

Have what

Changed You have changed a good deal I dont know whether I like it
or not Perhaps I shall be more certain by and by Now show me your war
cross At least you have brought that even if you havent brought your
uniform

He had the cross in his pocketbook and he showed it to her She
enthused over it of course and wished he might wear it even when in
citizens clothes She didnt see why he couldnt And it was SUCH
a pity he could not be in uniform Captain Blanchard had called
the evening before to see Mother about some war charities she was
interested in and he was still in uniform and wearing his decorations
too Albert suggested that probably Blanchard was still in service
Yes she believed he was but she could not see why that should make the
difference Albert had BEEN in service

He laughed at this and attempted to explain She seemed to resent the
attempt or the tone

I do wish she said almost pettishly that you wouldnt be so
superior

He was surprised Superior he repeated Superior I Superiority is
the very least of my feelings Isuperior Thats a joke

And oddly enough she resented that even more Why is it a joke she
demanded I should think you had the right to feel superior to almost
any one A heroand a genius You ARE superior

However the little flurry was but momentary and she was all sweetness
and smiles when she kissed him good night He was shown to his room by
a servant and amid its array of comfortsto him fresh from France
and the camp and his old room at South Harniss it was luxuriously
magnificenthe sat for some time thinking His thoughts should have
been happy ones yet they were not entirely so This is a curiously
unsatisfactory world sometimes

The next day he went shopping Fosdick had given him a card to his own
tailor and Madeline had given him the names of several shops where so
she declared he could buy the right sort of ties and things From the
tailors Albert emerged looking a trifle dazed after a visit to two of
the shops the dazed expression was even more pronounced His next
visits were at establishments farther downtown and not as exclusive
He returned to the Fosdick home feeling fairly well satisfied with the
results achieved Madeline however did not share his satisfaction

But Dad sent you to his tailor she said Why in the world didnt you
order your evening clothes there And Brett has the most stunning ties
Every one says so Instead you buy yours at a department store Now
why

He smiled My dear girl he said your fathers tailor estimated
that he might make me a very passable dress suit for one hundred and
seventyfive dollars Bretts ties were stunning just as you say but
the prices ranged from five to eight dollars which was more stunning
still For a young person from the country out of a job which is my
condition at present such things may be looked at but not handled I
cant afford them

She tossed her head What nonsense she exclaimed Youre not out of
a job as you call it You are a writer and a famous writer You have
written one book and you are going to write more Besides you must have
made heaps of money from The Lances Every one has been reading it

When he told her the amount of his royalty check she expressed the
opinion that the publisher must have cheated It ought to have been ever
and ever so much more than that Such wonderful poems

The next day she went to Bretts and purchased a half dozen of the most
expensive ties which she presented to him forthwith

There she demanded Arent those nicer than the ones you bought at
that old department store Well then

But Madeline I must not let you buy my ties

Why not It isnt such an unheardof thing for an engaged girl to give
her fiance a necktie

That isnt the idea I should have bought ties like those myself but I
couldnt afford them Now for you to

Nonsense You talk as if you were a beggar Dont be so silly

But Madeline

Stop I dont want to hear it

She rose and went out of the room She looked as if she were on the
verge of tears He felt obliged to accept the gift but he disliked the
principle of the things as much as ever When she returned she was very
talkative and gay and chatted all through luncheon The subject of the
ties was not mentioned again by either of them He was glad he had not
told her that his new dress suit was readymade

While in France awaiting his return home he had purchased a ring
and sent it to her She was wearing it of course Compared with other
articles of jewelry which she wore from time to time his ring made an
extremely modest showing She seemed quite unaware of the discrepancy
but he was aware of it

On an evening later in the week Mrs Fosdick gave a reception Quite
an informal affair she said in announcing her intention Just a few
intimate friends to meet Mr Speranza that is all Mostly lovers of
literaturediscerning people if I may say so

The quite informal affair looked quite formidably formal to Albert The
few intimate friends were many so it seemed to him There was still
enough of the former Albert Speranza left in his makeup to prevent
his appearing in the least distressed or ill at ease He was as he
had always been when in the public eye even as far back as the school
dancingclasses with the Misses Bradshaws young ladies perfectly
selfpossessed charmingly polite absolutely selfassured And his good
looks had not suffered during his years of imprisonment and suffering
He was no longer a handsome boy but he was an extraordinarily
attractive and distinguished man

Mrs Fosdick marked his manner and appearance and breathed a sigh of
satisfaction Madeline noted them Her young friends of the sex noted
them and whispered and looked approval What the young men thought does
not matter so much perhaps One of these was the Captain Blanchard of
whom Madeline had written and spoken He was a tall athletic chap
who looked well in his uniform and whose face was that of a healthy
cleanliving and cleanthinking young American He and Albert shook
hands and looked each other over Albert decided he should like
Blanchard if he knew him better The captain was not talkative in fact
he seemed rather taciturn Maids and matrons gushed when presented to
the lion of the evening It scarcely seemed possible that they were
actually meeting the author of The Lances of Dawn That wonderful book
Those wonderful poems How CAN you write them Mr Speranza When do
your best inspirations come Mr Speranza Oh if I could write as
you do I should walk on air The matron who breathed the lastquoted
ecstasy was distinctly weighty the mental picture of her pedestrian
trip through the atmosphere was interesting Alberts hand was patted by
the elderly spinsters young womens eyes lifted soulful glances to his

It was the sort of thing he would have revelled in three or four years
earlier Exactly the sort of thing he had dreamed of when the majority
of the poems they gushed over were written It was much the same thing
he remembered having seen his father undergo in the days when he and
the opera singer were together And his father had apparently rather
enjoyed it He realized all thisand he realized too with a queer
feeling that it should be so that he did not like it at all It was
silly Nothing he had written warranted such extravagances Hadnt these
people any sense of proportion They bored him to desperation The sole
relief was the behavior of the men particularly the middleaged or
elderly men obviously present through feminine compulsion They seized
his hand moved it up and down with a pumping motion uttered some
stereotyped prevarications about their pleasure at meeting him and their
having enjoyed his poems very much and then slid on in the direction of
the refreshment room

And Albert as he shook hands bowed and smiled and was charmingly
affable found his thoughts wandering until they settled upon Private
Mike Kelly and the picturesque language of the latter when he as
sergeant routed him out for guard duty Mike had not gushed over him
nor called him a genius He had called him many things but not that

He was glad indeed when he could slip away for a dance with Madeline He
found her chatting gaily with Captain Blanchard who had been her most
recent partner He claimed her from the captain and as he led her out to
the dance floor she whispered that she was very proud of him But I DO
wish YOU could wear your war cross she added

The quite informal affair was the first of many quite as informally
formal Also Mrs Fosdicks satellites and friends of the literary clubs
and the war work societies seized the opportunity to make much of the
heroic author of The Lances of Dawn His society was requested at teas
at afternoon as well as evening gatherings He would have refused most
of these invitations but Madeline and her mother seemed to take his
acceptance for granted in fact they accepted for him A ghastly
habit developed of asking him to read a few of his own poems on these
occasions PLEASE Mr Speranza It will be such a treat and such an
HONOR Usually a particular request was made that he read The Greater
Love Now The Greater Love was the poem which written in those
rapturous days when he and Madeline first became aware of their mutual
adoration was refused by one editor as a trifle too syrupy To read
that sticky effusion over and over again became a torment There were
occasions when if a man had referred to The Greater Love its author
might have howled profanely and offered bodily violence But no men ever
did refer to The Greater Love

On one occasion when a sentimental matron and her gushing daughter had
begged to know if he did not himself adore that poem if he did not
consider it the best he had ever written he had answered frankly
He was satiated with cake and tea and compliments that evening and
recklessly truthful You really wish to know my opinion of that poem
he asked Indeed and indeed they really wished to knew just that thing
Well then I think its rot he declared I loathe it

Of course mother and daughter were indignant Their comments reached
Madelines ear She took him to task

But why did you say it she demanded You know you dont mean it

Yes I do mean it It IS rot Lots of the stuff in that book of mine
is rot I did not think so once but I do now If I had the book to make
over again that sort wouldnt be included

She looked at him for a moment as if studying a problem

I dont understand you sometimes she said slowly You are different
And I think what you said to Mrs Bacon and Marian was very rude

Later when he went to look for her he found her seated with Captain
Blanchard in a corner They were eating ices and apparently enjoying
themselves He did not disturb them Instead he hunted up the offended
Bacons and apologized for his outbreak The apology although graciously
accepted had rather wearisome consequences Mrs Bacon declared she
knew that he had not really meant what he said

I realize how it must be she declared You people of temperament
of genius of aspirations are never quite satisfied you cannot be You
are always trying always seeking the higher attainment Achievements of
the past though to the rest of us wonderful and sublime are to youas
you say rot That is it is it not Albert said he guessed it was
and wandered away seeking seclusion and solitude When the affair broke
up he found Madeline and Blanchard still enjoying each others society
Both were surprised when told the hour



CHAPTER XVII


So the first three weeks of his proposed months visit passed and the
fourth began And more and more his feelings of dissatisfaction and
uneasiness increased The reasons for those feelings he found hard to
define The Fosdicks were most certainly doing their best to make him
comfortable and happy They were kindyes more than kind Mr
Fosdick he really began to like Mrs Fosdicks manner had a trace of
condescension in it but as the lady treated all creation with much the
same measure of condescension he was more amused than resentful And
MadelineMadeline was sweet and charming and beautiful There was in
her manner toward him or so he fancied a slight change perhaps a
change a trifle more marked since the evening when his expressed opinion
of The Greater Love had offended her and the Bacons It seemed to
him that she was more impatient more capricious sometimes almost
overwhelming him with attention and tenderness and then appearing to
forget him entirely and to be quite indifferent to his thoughts and
opinions Her moods varied greatly and there were occasions when he
found it almost impossible to please her At these times she took
offense when no offense was intended and he found himself apologizing
when to say the least the fault if there was any was not more than
half his But she always followed those moods with others of contrition
and penitence and then he was petted and fondled and his forgiveness
implored

These slight changes in her he noticed but they troubled him little
principally because he was coming to realize the great change in
himself More and more that change was forcing itself upon him The
stories and novels he had read during the first years of the war
the stories by English writers in which young men frivolous and
inconsequential had enlisted and fought and emerged from the ordeal
strong purposeful and madeoverthose stories recurred to him now
He had paid little attention to the makingover idea when he read
those tales but now he was forced to believe there might be something
in it Certainly something the three years or the discipline and
training and suffering or all combined had changed him He was not as
he used to be Things he liked very much he no longer liked at all And
where oh where was the serene selfsatisfaction which once was his

The change must be quite individual he decided All soldiers were not
so affected Take Blanchard for instance Blanchard had seen service
more and quite as hard fighting as he had seen but Blanchard was to
all appearances as lighthearted and serene and confident as ever
Blanchard was like Madeline he was much the same now as he had been
before the war Blanchard could dance and talk small talk and laugh and
enjoy himself Well so could he on occasions for that matter if that
had been all But it was not all or if it was why was he at other times
so discontented and uncomfortable What was the matter with him anyway

He drew more and more into his shell and became more quiet and less
talkative Madeline in one of her moods reproached him for it

I do wish you wouldnt be grumpy she said

They had been sitting in the library and he had lapsed into a fit of
musing answering her questions with absentminded monosyllables Now he
looked up

Grumpy he repeated Was I grumpy I beg your pardon

You should You answered every word I spoke to you with a grunt or a
growl I might as well have been talking to a bear

Im awfully sorry dear I didnt feel grumpy I was thinking I
suppose

Thinking You are always thinking Why think pray    If I
permitted myself to think I should go insane

Madeline what do you mean

Oh nothing Im partially insane now perhaps Come lets go to the
piano I feel like playing You dont mind do you

That evening Mrs Fosdick made a suggestion to her husband

Fletcher she said I am inclined to think it is time you and Albert
had a talk concerning the future A business talk I mean I am a little
uneasy about him From some things he has said to me recently I gather
that he is planning to earn his living with his pen

Well how else did you expect him to earn it as bookkeeper for the
South Harniss lumber concern

Dont be absurd What I mean is that he is thinking of devoting himself
to literature exclusively Dont interrupt me please That is very
beautiful and very idealistic and I honor him for it but I cannot see
Madeline as an attic poets wife can you

I cant and I told you so in the beginning

No Therefore I should take him to one side and tell him of the opening
in your firm With that as a means of keeping his feet on the ground his
brain may soar as it likes the higher the better

Mr Fosdick as usual obeyed orders and that afternoon Albert and he
had the business talk Conversation at dinner was somewhat strained
Mr Fosdick was quietly observant and seemed rather amused about
something His wife was dignified and her manner toward her guest was
inclined to be abrupt Alberts appetite was poor As for Madeline she
did not come down to dinner having a headache

She came down later however Albert alone in the library was sitting
a book upon his knees and his eyes fixed upon nothing in particular
when she came in

You are thinking again I see she said

He had not heard her enter Now he rose the book falling to the floor

Whywhy yes he stammered How are you feeling How is your head

It is no worse And no better I have been thinking too which perhaps
explains it Sit down Albert please I want to talk with you That is
what I have been thinking about that you and I must talk

She seated herself upon the davenport and he pulled forward a chair
and sat facing her For a moment she was silent When she did speak
however her question was very much to the point

Why did you say No to Fathers offer she asked He had been
expecting this very question or one leading up to it Nevertheless
he found answering difficult He hesitated and she watched him her
impatience growing

Well she asked

He sighed Madeline he said I am afraid you think me very
unreasonable certainly very ungrateful

I dont know what to think about you That is why I feel we must
have this talk Tell me please just what Father said to you this
afternoon

He saidwell the substance of what he said was to offer me a position
in his office in his firm

What sort of a position

Well II scarcely know I was to have a desk there andand be
generallyornamental I suppose It was not very definite the details
of the position but

The salary was good wasnt it

Yes more than good Much too good for the return I could make for it
so it seemed to me

And your prospects for the future Wasnt the offer what people call a
good opportunity

Why yes I suppose it was For the right sort of man it would have
been a wonderful opportunity Your father was most kind most generous
Madeline Please dont think I am not appreciative I am but

Dont I want to understand it all He offered you this opportunity
this partnership in his firm and you would not accept it Why Dont
you like my father

Yes I like him very much

Didnt you with the slightest possible curl of the lip think the
offer worthy of you    Oh I dont mean that Please forgive me I
am trying not to be disagreeable II just want to understand Albert
thats all

He nodded I know Madeline he said You have the right to ask It
wasnt so much a question of the offer being worthy of me as of my being
worthy the offer Oh Madeline why should you and I pretend You know
why Mr Fosdick made me that offer It wasnt because I was likely to be
worth ten dollars a year to his firm In Heavens name what use would I
be in a stockbrokers office with my makeup with my lack of business
ability He would be making a place for me there and paying me a high
salary for one reason only and you know what that is Now dont you

She hesitated now but only for an instant She colored a little but
she answered bravely

I suppose I do she said but what of it It is not unheard of is
it the taking ones prospective soninlaw into partnership

No butWere dodging the issue again Madeline If I were likely
to be of any help to your fathers business instead of a hindrance I
might perhaps see it differently As it is I couldnt accept unless I
were willing to be an object of charity

Did you tell Father that

Yes

What did he say

He said a good deal He was frank enough to say that he did not expect
me to be of great assistance to the firm But I might be of SOME usehe
didnt put it as baldly as that of courseand at all times I could
keep on with my writing with my poetry you know The brokerage
business should not interfere with my poetry he said your mother would
scalp him if it did that

She smiled faintly That sounds like dad she commented

Yes Well we talked and argued for some time on the subject He asked
me what supposing I did not accept this offer of his my plans for the
future might be I told him they were pretty unsettled as yet I meant
to write of course Not poetry altogether I realized I told him that
I was not a great poet a poet of genius

Madeline interrupted Her eyes flashed

Why do you say that she demanded I have heard you say it before
That is recently In the old days you were as sure as I that you were a
real poet or should be some day You never doubted it You used to tell
me so and I loved to hear you

Albert shook his head I was sure of so many things then he said I
must have been an insufferable kid

She stamped her foot It was less than three years ago that you said
it she declared You are not so frightfully ancient now    Well
go on go on How did it end the talk with Father I mean

I told him he continued that I meant to write and to earn my living
by writing I meant to try magazine workstories you knowand soon
a novel He asked if earning enough to support a wife on would not be
a long job at that time I said I was afraid it might but that that
seemed to me my particular game nevertheless

She interrupted again Did it occur to you to question whether or not
that determination of yours was quite fair to me she asked

Whywhy yes it did And I dont know that it IS exactly fair to you
I

Never mind Go on Tell me the rest How did it end

Well it ended in a sort of flareup Mr Fosdick was just a little bit
sarcastic and I expressed my feelings rather freelytoo freely Im
afraid

Never mind I want to know what you said

To be absolutely truthful then this is what I said I said that I
appreciated his kindness and was grateful for the offer But my mind was
made up I would not live upon his charity and draw a large salary for
doing nothing except be a little damned tame housepoet led around in
leash and exhibited at his wifes club meetings    That was about
all I think We shook hands at the end He didnt seem to like me any
the less for    Why Madeline have I offended you My language was
pretty strong I know but

She had bowed her head upon her arms amid the sofa cushions and was
crying He sprang to his feet and bent over her

Why Madeline he said again I beg your pardon Im sorry

Oh it isnt that she sobbed It isnt that I dont care what you
said

What is it then

She raised her head and looked at him

It is you she cried It is myself It is everything It is all
wrong II was so happy andand now I am miserable Ohoh I wish I
were dead

She threw herself upon the cushions again and wept hysterically He
stood above her stroking her hair trying to soothe her to comfort
her and all the time he felt like a brute a heartless beast At last
she ceased crying sat up and wiped her eyes with her handkerchief

There she exclaimed I will not be silly any longer I wont be I
WONT    Now tell me Why have you changed so

He looked down at her and shook his head He was consciencestricken and
fully as miserable as she professed to be

I dont know he said I am older andandand I DONT see things as
I used to If that book of mine had appeared three years ago I have no
doubt I should have believed it to be the greatest thing ever printed
Now when people tell me it is and I read what the reviewers said and
all that II DONT believe I KNOW it isnt greatthat is the most
of it isnt There is some pretty good stuff of course butYou see
I think it wasnt the poems themselves that made it sell I think it was
all the fool tommyrot the papers printed about me about my being a hero
and all that rubbish when they thought I was dead you know That

She interrupted Oh dont she cried Dont I dont care about
the old book Im not thinking about that Im thinking about you YOU
arent the samethe same toward me

Toward you Madeline I dont understand what you mean

Yes you do Of course you do If you were the same as you used to be
you would let Father help you We used to talk about that very thing
andand you didnt resent it then

Didnt I Well perhaps I didnt But I think I remember our speaking
sometimes of sacrificing everything for each other We were to live in
poverty if necessary and I was to write you know and

Stop All that was nonsense nonsense you know it

Yes Im afraid it was

You know it was And if you were as you used to be if you

Madeline

What Why did you interrupt me

Because I wanted to ask you a question Do you think YOU are exactly
the sameas you used to be

What do you mean

Havent YOU changed a little Are you as sure as you were thenas sure
of your feeling toward me

She gazed at him wideeyed WHAT do you mean

I mean ARE you sure It has seemed to me that perhapsI was out of
your life for a long time you know and during a good deal of that
time it seemed certain that I had gone forever I am not blaming you
goodness knows butMadeline isnt thereWell if I hadnt come back
mightnt there have been some oneelse

She turned pale

What do she stammered inarticulate Why why

It was Captain Blanchard wasnt it

The color came back to her cheeks with a rush She blushed furiously and
sprang to her feet

Howhow can you say such things she cried What do you mean How
DARE you say Captain Blanchard took advantage ofHowhow DARE you say
I was not loyal to you It is not true It is not true I was I am
There hasnt been a worda word between us sincesince the news came
that you wereI told himI saidAnd he has been splendid Splendid
And now you sayOh what AM I saying What SHALL I do

She collapsed once more among the cushions He leaned forward

My dear girl he began but she broke in

I HAVENT been disloyal she cried I have triedOh I have tried so
hard

Hush Madeline hush I understand I understand perfectly It is all
right really it is

And I should have kept on trying alwaysalways

Yes dear yes But do you think a married life with so much trying in
it likely to be a happy one It is better to know it now isnt it a
great deal better for both of us Madeline I am going to my room I
want you to think to think over all this and then we will talk
again I dont blame you I dont dear really I think I realize
everythingall of it Good night dear

He stooped and kissed her She sobbed but that was all The next
morning a servant came to his room with a parcel and a letter The
parcel was a tiny one It was the ring he had given her in its case
The letter was short and much blotted It read


Dear Albert

I have thought and thought as you told me to and I have concluded that
you were right It IS best to know it now Forgive me please PLEASE I
feel wicked and horrid and I HATE myself but I think this is best Oh
do forgive me Goodby

MADELINE


His reply was longer At its end he wrote


Of course I forgive you In the first place there is nothing to forgive
The unforgivable thing would have been the sacrifice of your happiness
and your future to a dream and a memory I hope you will be very happy
I am sure you will be for Blanchard is I know a fine fellow The best
of fortune to you both


The next forenoon he sat once more in the car of the morning train for
Cape Cod looking out of the window He had made the journey from New
York by the night boat and had boarded the Cape train at Middleboro All
the previous day and in the evening as he tramped the cold windswept
deck of the steamer he had been trying to collect his thoughts to
readjust them to the new situation to comprehend in its entirety the
great change that had come in his life The vague plans the happy
indefinite dreams all the rainbows and roses had gone shivered to bits
like the reflection in a broken mirror Madeline his Madeline was his
no longer Nor was he hers In a way it seemed impossible

He tried to analyze his feelings It seemed as if he should have been
crushed griefstricken broken He was inclined to reproach himself
because he was not Of course there was a sadness about it a regret
that the wonder of those days of love and youth had passed But the
sorrow was not bitter the regret was but a wistful longing the sweet
lingering fragrance of a memory that was all Toward her Madeline he
feltand it surprised him too to find that he feltnot the slightest
trace of resentment And more surprising still he felt none toward
Blanchard He had meant what he said in his letter he wished for them
both the greatest happiness

Andthere was no use attempting to shun the facthis chief feeling
as he sat there by the car window looking out at the familiar landscape
was a great relief a consciousness of escape from what might have
been a miserable crushing mistake for him and for her And with this
a growing sense of freedom of buoyancy It seemed wicked to feel like
that Then it came to him the thought that Madeline doubtless was
experiencing the same feeling And he did not mind a bit he hoped she
was bless her

A youthful cigar drummer on his first DownEast trip sat down beside
him

Kind of a flat bare country aint it observed the drummer with
a jerk of his head toward the window Looks bleak enough to me Know
anything about this neck of the woods do you

Albert turned to look at him

Meaning the Cape he asked

Sure

Indeed I do I know all about it

That so Say you sound as if you liked it

Albert turned back to the window again

Like it he repeated I love it Then he sighed a sigh of
satisfaction and added You see I BELONG here

His grandparents and Rachel were surprised when he walked into the house
that noon and announced that he hoped dinner was ready because he was
hungry But their surprise was more than balanced by their joy Captain
Zelotes demanded to know how long he was going to stay

As long as youll have me Grandfather was the answer

Eh Well that would be a considerble spell if you left it to us but
I callate that girl in New York will have somethin to say as to time
limit wont she

Albert smiled Ill tell you about that by and by he said

He did not tell them until that evening after supper It was Friday
evening and Olive was going to prayermeeting but she delayed putting
on her things to hear the tale The news that the engagement was off
and that her grandson was not after all to wed the daughter of the
Honorable Fletcher Fosdick shocked and grieved her not a little

Oh dear she sighed I suppose you know whats best Albert and
maybe as you say you wouldnt have been happy but I DID feel sort of
proud to think my boy was goin to marry a millionaires daughter

Captain Zelotes made no commentthen He asked to be told more
particulars Albert described the life at the Fosdick home the
receptions his enforced exhibitions and readings At length the recital
reached the point of the interview in Fosdicks office

So he offered you to take you into the firmeh son he observed

Yes sir

Humph Fosdick Williamson and Hendricks are one of the biggest
brokerage houses goin so a good many New Yorkers have told me

No doubt But Grandfather youve had some experience with me as a
business man how do you think I would fit into a firm of stockbrokers

Captain Lotes eye twinkled but he did not answer the question Instead
he asked

Just what did you give Fosdick as your reason for not sayin yes

Albert laughed Well Grandfather he said Ill tell you I said
that I appreciated his kindness and all that but that I would not
draw a big salary for doing nothing except to be a little damned
tame housepoet led around in leash and shown off at his wifes club
meetings

Mrs Snow uttered a faint scream Oh Albert she exclaimed She might
have said more but a shout from her husband prevented her doing so

Captain Zelotes had risen and his mighty hand descended with a stinging
slap upon his grandsons shoulder

Bully for you boy he cried Then turning to Olive he added
Mother Ive always kind of callated that you had one man around this
house Now by the Lord AMighty I know youve got TWO

Olive rose Well she declared emphatically that may be but if both
those men are goin to start in swearin right here in the sittin room
I think its high time SOMEBODY in that family went to church

So to prayer meeting she went with Mrs Ellis as escort and her
husband and grandson seated in armchairs before the sitting room stove
both smoking talked and talked of the past and of the futurenot as
man to boy nor as grandparent to grandson but for the first time as
equals without reservations as man to man



CHAPTER XVIII


The next morning Albert met old Mr Kendall After breakfast Captain
Zelotes had gone as usual directly to the office His grandson
however had not accompanied him

What are you callatin to do this mornin Al inquired the captain

Oh I dont know exactly Grandfather Im going to look about the
place a bit write a letter to my publishers and take a walk I think
You will probably see me at the office pretty soon Ill look in there
by and by

Aint goin to write one or two of those five hundred dollar stories
before dinner time are you

I guess not sir Im afraid they wont be written as quickly as all
that

Captain Lote shook his head Godfreys he exclaimed it aint the
writin of em Id worry about so much as the gettin paid for em
Youre sure that editor man aint crazy you say

I hope he isnt He seemed sane enough when I saw him

Well I dont know Its live and learn I suppose but if anybody but
you had told me that magazine folks paid as much as five hundred dollars
a piece for yarns made up out of a fellers head without a word of truth
in em Idwell I should have told the feller that told me to go to
a doctor right off and have HIS head examined Butwell as tis I
callate Id better have my own looked at So long Al Come in to the
office if you get a chance

He hurried out Albert walked to the window and watched the sturdy
figure swinging out of the yard He wondered if should he live to
his grandfathers age his step would be as firm and his shoulders as
square

Olive laid a hand on his arm

You dont mind his talkin that way about your writin those stories
do you Albert she asked a trace of anxiety in her tone He dont
mean it you know He dont understand itsays he dont himselfbut
hes awful proud of you just the same Why last night after you and
he had finished talkin and he came up to bedand the land knows what
time of night or mornin THAT washe woke me out of a sound sleep to
tell me about that New York magazine man givin you a written order
to write six stories for his magazine at five hundred dollars a piece
Zelotes couldnt seem to get over it Think of it Mother he kept
sayin Think of it Pretty nigh twice what I pay as good a man as
Labe Keeler for keepin books a whole year And Al says he ought to do
a story every fornit I used to jaw his head off tellin him he was on
the road to starvation and all that Tut tut tut Mother Ive waited
a long time to say it but it looks as if you married a fool   
Thats the way he talked but hes a long ways from bein a fool your
grandfather is Albert

Albert nodded No one knows that better than I he said with
emphasis

Theres one thing she went on that kind of troubled me He said
you was goin to insist on payin board here at home Now you know this
house is yours And we love to

He put his arm about her I know it Grandmother he broke in
quickly But that is all settled I am going to try to make my own
living in my own way I am going to write and see what I am really
worth I have my royalty money you know most of it and I have this
order for the series of stories I can afford to pay for my keep and
I shall You see as I told Grandfather last night I dont propose to
live on his charity any more than on Mr Fosdicks

She sighed

So Zelotes said she admitted He told me no less than three times
that you said it It seemed to tickle him most to death for some
reason and thats queer too for hes anything but stingy But there
I suppose you can pay board if you want to though who youll pay it to
is another thing _I_ shant take a cent from the only grandson Ive got
in the world

It was while on his stroll down to the village that Albert met Mr
Kendall The reverend gentleman was plodding along carrying a market
basket from the end of which beneath a fragment of newspaper the tail
and rear third of a huge codfish drooped The basket and its contents
must have weighed at least twelve pounds and the old minister was as
Captain Zelotes would have said making heavy weather of it Albert went
to his assistance

How do you do Mr Kendall he said Im afraid that basket is rather
heavy isnt it Maynt I help you with it Then seeing that the old
gentleman did not recognize him he added I am Albert Speranza

Down went the basket and the codfish and Mr Kendall seized him by both
hands

Why of course of course he cried Of course of course Its our
young hero isnt it Our poet our happy warrior Yesyes of course
So glad to see you Albert    Er    er    How is your mother

You mean my grandmother She is very well thank you

Yeseryes your grandmother of course    Er    er   
Did you see my codfish Isnt it a magnificent one I am very fond of
codfish and we almost never have it at home So just now I happened to
be passing Jonathan Howeshe is theerfishdealer you know and
   Jonathan is a very regular attendant at my Sunday morning services
He isis    Dear me    What was I about to say

Being switched back to the main track by Albert he explained that he
had seen a number of cod in Mr Howes possession and had bought this
specimen Howes had lent him the basket

And the newspaper he explained adding with triumph I shall dine
on codfish today I am happy to say Judging by appearances he might
dine and sup and breakfast on codfish and still have a supply remaining
Albert insisted on carrying the spoil to the parsonage He was doing
nothing in particular and it would be a pleasure he said Mr Kendall
protested for the first minute or so but then forgot just what the
protest was all about and rambled garrulously on about affairs in the
parish He had failed in other faculties but his flow of language was
still unimpeded They entered the gate of the parsonage Albert put the
basket on the upper step

There he said now I must go Good morning Mr Kendall

Oh but you arent going You must come in a moment I want to give you
the manuscript of that sermon of mine on the casting down of Baal that
is the one in which I liken the military power of Germany to the brazen
idol which    Just a moment Albert The manuscript is in my desk
and    Oh dear me the door is locked    Helen Helen

He was shaking the door and shouting his daughters name Albert was
surprised and not a little disturbed It had not occurred to him that
Helen could be at home It is true that before he left for New York his
grandmother had said that she was planning to return home to be with her
father but since then he had heard nothing more concerning her Neither
of his grandparents had mentioned her name in their letters nor since
his arrival the day before had they mentioned it And Mr Kendall had
not spoken of her during their walk together Albert was troubled and
taken aback In one way he would have liked to meet Helen very much
indeed They had not met since before the war But he did not somehow
wish to meet her just then He did not wish to meet anyone who would
speak of Madeline or ask embarrassing questions He turned to go

Another time Mr Kendall he said Good morning

But he had gone only a few yards when the reverend gentleman was calling
to him to return

Albert Albert called Mr Kendall

He was obliged to turn back he could do nothing else and as he did so
the door opened It was Helen who opened it and she stood there upon
the threshold and looked down at him For a moment a barely perceptible
interval she looked then he heard her catch her breath quickly and saw
her put one hand upon the door jamb as if for support The next and
she was running down the steps her hands outstretched and the light of
welcome in her eyes

Why Albert Speranza she cried Why ALBERT

He seized her hands Helen he cried and added involuntarily My
but its good to see you again

She laughed and so did he All his embarrassment was gone They were
like two children like the boy and girl who had known each other in the
old days

And when did you get here she asked And what do you mean by
surprising us like this I saw your grandfather yesterday morning and he
didnt say a word about your coming

He didnt know I was coming I didnt know it myself until the day
before And when did you come Your father didnt tell me you were here
I didnt know until I heard him call your name

He was calling it again Calling it and demanding attention for his
precious codfish

Yes Father yes in a minute she said Then to Albert Come in
Oh of course youll come in

Why yes if I wont be interfering with the housekeeping

You wont Yes Father yes Im coming Mercy where did you get such
a wonderful fish Come in Albert As soon as I get Fathers treasure
safe in the hands of Maria Ill be back Father will keep you company
No pardon me I am afraid he wont hes gone to the kitchen already
And I shall have to go too for just a minute Ill hurry

She hastened to the kitchen whither Mr Kendall tugging the fish
basket had preceded her Albert entered the little sittingroom and sat
down in a chair by the window The room looked just as it used to look
just as neat just as homelike just as well kept And when she came
back and they began to talk it seemed to him that she too was just as
she used to be She was a trifle less girlish more womanly perhaps but
she was just as good to look at just as bright and cheerful and in her
conversation she had the same quietly certain way of dealing directly
with the commonsense realities and not the fuss and feathers It seemed
to him that she had not changed at all that she herself was one of the
realities the wholesome home realities like Captain Zelotes and Olive
and the old house they lived in He told her so She laughed

You make me feel as ancient as the pyramids she said

He shook his head I am the ancient he declared This war hasnt
changed you a particle Helen but it has handed me an awful jolt At
times I feel as if I must have sailed with Noah And as if I had wasted
most of the time since

She smiled Just what do you mean by that she asked

I meanwell I dont know exactly what I do mean I guess I seem
to have an unsettled feeling Im not satisfied with myself And as I
remember myself he added with a shrug that condition of mind was
not usual with me

She regarded him for a moment without speaking with the appraising look
in her eyes which he remembered so well which had always reminded him
of the look in his grandfathers eyes and which when a boy he resented
so strongly

Yes she said slowly I think you have changed Not because you say
you feel so much older or because you are uneasy and dissatisfied So
many of the men I talked with at the camp hospital the men who had been
over there and had been wounded as you were said they felt the same
way That doesnt mean anything I think except that it is dreadfully
hard to get readjusted again and settle down to everyday things But
it seems to me that you have changed in other ways You are a little
thinner but broader too arent you And you do look older especially
about the eyes And of coursewell of course I think I do miss a
little of the Albert Speranza I used to know the young chap with the
chip on his shoulder for all creation to knock off

Young jackass

Oh no indeed He had his good points But there were wasting time
and we have so much to talk about Youwhy what am I thinking of I
have neglected the most important thing in the world And you have just
returned from New York too Tell me how is Madeline Fosdick

She is well But tell me about yourself You have been in all sorts of
war work havent you Tell me about it

Oh my work didnt amount to much At first I Red Crossed in Boston
then I went to Devens and spent a long time in the camp hospital there

Pretty trying wasnt it

Whyyes some of it was When the flu epidemic was raging and the
poor fellows were having such a dreadful time it was bad enough After
that I was sent to Eastview In the hospital there I met the boys who
had been wounded on the other side and who talked about old age and
dissatisfaction and uneasiness just as you do But MY work doesnt
count You are the person to be talked about Since I have seen you you
have become a famous poet and a hero and

Dont

She had been smiling now she was very serious

Forgive me Albert she said We have been joking you and I but
there was a time when wewhen your friends did not joke Oh Albert
if you could have seen the Snow place as I saw it then It was as if all
the hope and joy and everything worth while had been crushed out of it
Your grandmother poor little woman was brave and quiet but we
all knew she was trying to keep up for Captain Zelotes sake And
heAlbert you can scarcely imagine how the news of your death changed
him    Ah well it was a hard time a dreadful time forfor every
one

She paused and he turning to look at her saw that there were tears in
her eyes He knew of her affection for his grandparents and theirs for
her Before he could speak she was smiling again

But now that is all over isnt it she said And the Snows are
the happiest people in the country I do believe AND the proudest of
course So now you must tell me all about it about your experiences
and about your war cross and about your literary workoh about
everything

The allinclusive narrative was not destined to get very far Old Mr
Kendall came hurrying in the sermon on the casting down of Baal in his
hand Thereafter he led guided and to a large extent monopolized the
conversation His discourse had proceeded perhaps as far as Thirdly
when Albert looking at his watch was surprised to find it almost
dinner time Mr Kendall still talking departed to his study to hunt
for another sermon The young people said goodby in his absence

It has been awfully good to see you again Helen declared Albert
But I told you that in the beginning didnt I You seem likewell
like a part of home you know And home means something to me nowadays

Im glad to hear you speak of South Harniss as home Of course I know
you dont mean to make it a permanent homeI imagine Madeline would
have something to say about thatbut it is nice to have you speak as if
the old town meant something to you

He looked about him

I love the place he said simply

I am glad So do I but then I have lived here all my life The next
time we talk I want to know more about your plans for the futureyours
and Madelines I mean How proud she must be of you

He looked up at her she was standing upon the upper step and he on the
walk below

Madeline and I he began Then he stopped What was the use He did
not want to talk about it He waved his hand and turned away

After dinner he went out into the kitchen to talk to Mrs Ellis who
was washing dishes She was doing it as she did all her share of the
housework with an energy and capability which would have delighted the
soul of a scientific management expert Except when under the spell of
a sympathetic attack Rachel was ever distinctly on the job

And of course she was as always glad to see her protege her Robert
Penfold The proprietary interest which she had always felt in him was
more than ever hers now Had not she been the sole person to hint at the
possibility of his being alive when every one else had given him up for
dead Had not she been the only one to suggest that he might have been
taken prisoner Had SHE ever despaired of seeing him againon this
earth and in the flesh Indeed she had not at least she had never
admitted it if she had So then hadnt she a RIGHT to feel that she
owned a share in him No one ventured to dispute that right

She turned and smiled over one ample shoulder when he entered the
kitchen

Hello she hailed cheerfully Come callin have you RobertAlbert
I mean It would have been a great help to me if youd been christened
Robert I call you that so much to myself it comes almost more natural
than the other On account of you bein so just like Robert Penfold in
the book you know she added

Yes yes of course Rachel I understand put in Albert hastily He
was not in the mood to listen to a dissertation on a text taken from
Foul Play He looked about the room and sighed happily

There isnt a speck anywhere is there he observed It is just as it
used to be just as I used to think of it when I was laid up over there
When I wanted to try and eat a bit so as to keep what strength I had
I would think about this kitchen of yours Rachel It didnt do to
think of the places where the prison stuff was cooked They were
notappetizing

Mrs Ellis nodded I presume likely not she observed Well dont
tell me about em Ive just scrubbed this kitchen from stem to stern
If I heard about those prison places Id feel like startin right in
and scrubbin it all over again I know I should    Dirty pigs I
wish I had the scourin of some of those Germans IdI dont know as I
wouldnt skin em alive

Albert laughed Some of them pretty nearly deserved it he said

Rachel smiled grimly Well lets talk about nice things she said
Oh Issy Price was here this forenoon Capn Lote sent him over from
the office on an errand and he said he saw you and Mr Kendall goin
down street together just as he was comin along He hollered at you
but you didnt hear him Cordin to Issachars tell you was luggin a
basket with Jonahs whale in it or somethin like that

Albert described his encounter with the minister Rachel was much
interested

Oh so you saw Helen she said Well I guess she was surprised to
see you

Not more than I was to see her I didnt know she was in town Not a
soul had mentioned ityou nor Grandfather nor Grandmother

The housekeeper answered without turning her head Guess we had so many
things to talk about we forgot it she said Yes shes been here over
a week now High time from what I hear The poor old parson has failed
considerble and Maria Prices housekeepin and cookin is enough to
make a well man sickor wish he was But hell be looked after now
Helen will look after him Shes the most capable girl there is in
Ostable County Did she tell you about what she done in the Red Cross
and the hospitals

She said something about it not very much

Umhm She wouldnt bein Helen Kendall But the Red Cross folks said
enough and theyre sayin it yet Why

She went on to tell of Helens work in the Red Cross depots and in the
camp and hospitals It was an inspiring story

There they was said Rachel the poor things just boys most of em
dyin of that dreadful influenza like rats as you might say And of
course its dreadful catchin and a good many was more afraid of it
than they would have been of bullets enough sight But Helen Kendall
want afraidno siree Why

And so on Albert listened hearing most of it but losing some as his
thoughts wandered back to the Helen he had known as a boy and the Helen
he had met that forenoon Her face as she had welcomed him at the
parsonage doorit was surprising how clearly it showed before his
minds eye He had thought at first that she had not changed in
appearance That was not quite trueshe had changed a little but it
was merely the fulfillment of a promise that was all Her eyes her
smile above a hospital bedhe could imagine what they must have seemed
like to a lonely homesick boy wrestling with the flu

And dont talk he heard the housekeeper say as he drifted out of
his reverie if she want popular around that hospital around both
hospitals furs that goes The patients idolized her and the other
nurses they loved her and the doctors

Did they love her too Albert asked with a smile as she hesitated

She laughed Some of em did I callate she answered You see I
got most of my news about it all from Bessie Ryder Cornelius Ryders
niece lives up on the road to the Center you used to know her Albert
Bessie was nursin in that same hospital the one Helen was at first
Cordin to her there was some doctor or officer tryin to shine up to
Helen most of the time When she was at Eastview so Bessie heard there
was a real bigbug in the Army a sort of Admiral or Commodore amongst
the doctors he was and HE was trottin after her or would have been if
shed let him Course you have to make some allowances for Bessieshe
wouldnt be a Ryder if she didnt take so many words to say so little
that the truth gets stretched pretty thin afore she finishedbut there
must have been SOMETHIN in it And all about her bein such a wonderful
nurse and doin so much for the Red Cross I KNOW is true    Eh Did
you say anything Albert

Albert shook his head No Rachel he replied I didnt speak

I thought I heard you or somebody say somethin IWhy Laban Keeler
what are you doin away from your desk this time in the afternoon

Laban grinned as he entered the kitchen

Did I hear you say you thought you heard somebody sayin somethin
Rachel he inquired Thats queer aint it Seemed to me _I_ heard
somebody sayin somethin as I come up the path just now Seemed as if
they was sayin it right here in the kitchen too Twasnt your
voice Albert and it couldnt have been Rachels cause she NEVER
talksspecially to you Its too bad the prejudice shes got against
you Albert he added with a wink Umhm too badyes tisyes
yes

Mrs Ellis sniffed

And thats what the newspapers in war time used to callereroh
dear what was itcamelseemss if twas somethin about a camel

Camouflage suggested Albert

Thats it All that talk about me is just camouflage to save him
answerin my question But hes goin to answer it What are you doin
away from the office this time in the afternoon I want to know

Mr Keeler perched his small figure on the corner of the kitchen table

Well to tell you the truth Rachel he said solemnly Im here to do
what the folks in books call demand an explanation You and I Rachel
are just as good as engaged to be married aint we Ive been keepin
company with you for the last twenty forty or sixty years some such
spell as that Now just as Im gettin used to it and beginnin to
consider it a settled arrangement as you may say I come into this
house and find you shut up in the kitchen with another man Now what

The housekeeper advanced toward him with the dripping dishcloth

Laban Keeler she threatened if you dont stop your foolishness and
answer my question I declare Ill

Laban slid from his perch and retired behind the table

Another man he repeated And SOME folksnot many of course but
somemight be crazy enough to say he was a betterlookin man than
I am Now bein ragin jealousAll right Rachel all right I
surrender Dont hit me with all those soapsuds I dont want to go back
to the office foamin at the mouth The reason Im here is that I had to
go down street to see about the sheathin for the Red Mens lodge room
Issy took the order but he wasnt real sure whether twas sheathin
or scantlin they wanted so I told Capn Lote Id run down myself and
straighten it out On the way back I saw you two through the window and
I thought Id drop in and worry you So here I am

Mrs Ellis nodded Yes she sniffed And all that camelcamelOh
DEAR what DOES ail me All that camelNo use Ive forgot it again

Never mind Rachel said Mr Keeler consolingly All
theermenagerie was just that and nothin more Oh by the way Al
he added speakin of camelsdont you think Ive done pretty well to
go so long without anyerliquid nourishment Not a drop since you and
I enlisted together    Oh she knows about it now he added with
a jerk of his head in the housekeepers direction I felt twas fairly
safe and settled so I told her I told her Yes yes yes Umhm so I
did

Albert turned to the lady

You should be very proud of him Rachel he said seriously I think
I realize a little something of the fight he has made and it is bully
You should be proud of him

Rachel looked down at the little man

I am she said quietly I guess likely he knows it

Laban smiled The folks in Washington are doin their best to help me
out he said Theyre goin to take the stuff away from everybody sos
to make sure _I_ dont get any more Theyll probably put up a monument
to me for startin the thing dont you think they will Al Eh Dont
you now

Albert and he walked up the road together Laban told a little more of
his battle with John Barleycorn

I had half a dozen spells when I had to set my teeth those Ive got
left and hang on he said And the hanginon want as easy as
stickin to flypaper neither Honest though I think the hardest was
when the news came that you was alive Al II just wanted to start in
and celebrate Wanted to whoop her up I did He paused a moment and
then added I tried whoopin on sassparilla and vanilla sody but
twant satisfactory Couldnt seem to raise a real loud whisper let
alone a whoop No I couldntno no

Albert laughed and laid a hand on his shoulder Youre all right
Labe he declared I know you and I say so

Laban slowly shook his head His smile as he answered was rather
pathetic

Im a long long ways from bein all right Al he said A long ways
from that I am If Id made my fight thirty year ago I might have been
nigher to amountin to somethin    Oh well for Rachels sake
Im glad Ive made it now Shes stuck to me when everybody would have
praised her for chuckin me to Tophet I was readin one of Thackerays
books tother nightHenry Esmond twas youve read it Al of course
I was readin it tother night for the ninetyninth time or thereabouts
and I run across the place where it says its strange what a man can
do and a woman still keep thinkin hes an angel Thats true too Al
Not with the return of the slight smile that Rachel ever went so far
as to call me an angel No no Theres limits where you cant stretch
her commonsense any farther Callin me an angel would be just past the
limit Yes yes yes I guess SO

They spoke of Captain Zelotes and Olive and of their grief and
discouragement when the news of Alberts supposed death reached them

Do you know said Labe I believe Helen Kendalls comin there for a
week did em more good than anything else She got away from her soldier
nursin somehowmust have been able to pull the strings considerble
hardern the average to do itand just came down to the Snow place and
sort of took charge along with Rachel Course she didnt live there her
father thought she was visitin him I guess likely but she was with
Capn Lote and Olive most of the time Rachel says she never made
a fuss you understand just was there and helped and was quiet and
softspoken and capable andand comfortin thats about the word I
guess Rachel always thought a sight of Helen afore that but since then
she swears by her

That eveningor rather that night for they did not leave the sitting
room until after twelveMrs Snow heard her grandson walking the floor
of his room and called to ask if he was sick

Im all right Grandmother he called in reply Just taking a little
exercise before turning in thats all Sorry if I disturbed you

The exercise was as a matter of fact almost entirely mental the
pacing up and down merely an unconscious physical accompaniment Albert
Speranza was indulging in introspection He was reviewing and assorting
his thoughts and his impulses and trying to determine just what they
were and why they were and whither they were tending It was a mental
and spiritual picking to pieces and the result was humiliating and in
its turn resulted in a brandnew determination

Ever since his meeting with Helen a meeting which had been quite
unpremeditated he had thought of but little except her During his talk
with her in the parsonage sitting room he had beenthere was no use
pretending to himself that it was otherwisemore contented with the
world more optimistic happier than he had been for months it seemed
to him for years Even while he was speaking to her of his uneasiness
and dissatisfaction he was dimly conscious that at that moment he was
less uneasy and less dissatisfied conscious that the solid ground was
beneath his feet at last that here was the haven after the storm here
was

He pulled up sharply This line of thought was silly dangerous wicked
What did it mean Three days before only three days he had left
Madeline Fosdick the girl whom he had worshiped adored and who
had loved him Yes there was no use pretending there either he and
Madeline HAD loved each other Of course he realized now that their
love had nothing permanently substantial about it It was the romance
of youth a dream which they had shared together and from which
fortunately for both they had awakened in time And of course he
realized too that the awakening had begun long long before the actual
parting took place But nevertheless only three days had elapsed since
that parting and nowWhat sort of a man was he

Was he like his father Was it what Captain Zelotes used to call the
Portygee streak which was now cropping out The opera singer had been
of the butterfly typein his later years a middleaged butterfly whose
wings creaked somewhatbut decidedly a flitter from flower to flower
As a boy Albert had been aware in an uncertain fashion of his
fathers fondness for the sex Now older his judgment of his parent
was not as lenient was clearer more discerning He understood now Was
his own Portygee streak his inherited temperament responsible for
his leaving one girl on a Tuesday and on Friday finding his thoughts
concerned so deeply with another

Well no matter no matter One thing was certainHelen should
never know of that feeling He would crush it down he would use his
commonsense He would be a decent man and not a blackguard For he had
had his chance and had tossed it away What would she think of him now
if he came to her after Madeline had thrown him overthat is what Mrs
Fosdick would say would take pains that every one else should say that
Madeline had thrown him overwhat would Helen think of him if he came
to her with a secondhand love like that

And of course she would not think of him as a lover at all Why should
she In the boy and girl days she had refused to let him speak of such a
thing She was his friend a glorious a wonderful friend but that was
all all she ever dreamed of being

Well that was right that was as it should be He should be thankful
for such a friend He was of course And he would concentrate all his
energies upon his work upon his writing That was it that was it
Good it was settled

So he went to bed and eventually to sleep



CHAPTER XIX


While dressing in the cold light of dawn his perturbations of the
previous night appeared in retrospect as rather boyish and unnecessary
His sudden and unexpected meeting with Helen and their talk together had
tended to make him oversentimental that was all He and she were to be
friends of course but there was no real danger of his allowing himself
to think of her except as a friend No indeed He opened the bureau
drawer in search of a tie and there was the package of snapshots just
where he had tossed them that night when he first returned home
after musterout Helens photograph was the uppermost He looked at
itlooked at it for several minutes Then he closed the drawer again
and hurriedly finished his dressing A part at least of his resolve
of the night before had been sound commonsense His brain was suffering
from lack of exercise Work was what he needed hard work

So to work he went without delay A place to work in was the first
consideration He suggested the garret but his grandmother and Rachel
held up their hands and lifted their voices in protest

No INDEED declared Olive Zelotes has always talked about writin
folks and poets starvin in garrets If you went up attic to work hed
be teasin me from mornin to night Besides youd freeze up there if
the smell of mothballs didnt choke you first No you wait Ive got a
notion Theres that old table desk of Zelotes in the settin room He
dont hardly ever use it nowadays You take it upstairs to your own room
and work in there You can have the oilheater to keep you warm

So that was the arrangement made and in his own room Albert sat down at
the battered old desk which had been not only his grandfathers but
his greatgrandfathers property to concentrate upon the first of
the series of stories ordered by the New York magazine He had already
decided upon the general scheme for the series A boy ragamuffin son
of immigrant parents rising after a wrong start by sheer grit and
natural shrewdness and ability step by step to competence and success
winning a place in and the respect of a community There was nothing new
in the idea itself Some things his soldier chum Mike Kelley had told
him concerning an uncle of hisMikessuggested it The novelty he
hoped might come from the incidents the various problems faced by his
hero the solution of each being a step upward in the latters career
and in the formation of his character He wanted to write if he could
the story of the building of one more worthwhile American for Albert
Speranza like so many others set to thinking by the war and the war
experiences was realizing strongly that the gabbling of a formula and
the swearing of an oath of naturalization did not necessarily make an
American There were too many eager to take that oath with tongue in
cheek and knife in sleeve Too many for the first time in their
lives breathing and speaking as free men thanks to the protection of
Columbias arm yet planning to stab their protectress in the back

So Alberts hero was to be an American an American to whom the
term meant the highest and the best If he had hunted a lifetime for
something to please and interest his grandfather he could not have hit
the mark nearer the center Capn Lote of course pretended a certain
measure of indifference but that was for Olive and Rachels benefit It
would never do for the scoffer to become a convert openly and at once
The feminine members of the household clamored each evening to have the
author read aloud his days installment The captain sniffed

Oh dear dear with a groan now Ive got to hear all that madeup
stuff that happened to a parcel of madeup folks that never lived and
never will Waste of time waste of time Wheres my Transcript

But it was noticedand commented upon you may be sureby his wife and
housekeeper that the Transcript was likely to be before the reading had
progressed far either in the captains lap or on the floor And when
the discussion following the reading was under way Captain Zelotes
opinions were expressed quite as freely as any ones else Laban Keeler
got into the habit of dropping in to listen

One fateful evening the reading was interrupted by the arrival of
Mr Kendall The reverend gentleman had come to make a pastoral call
Alberts hero was in the middle of a situation The old clergyman
insisted upon the continuation of the reading It was continued and so
was the discussion following it in fact the discussion seemed likely
to go on indefinitely for the visitor showed no inclination of leaving
At tenthirty his daughter appeared to inquire about him and to
escort him home Then he went but under protest Albert walked to the
parsonage with them

Now weve started somethin groaned the captain as the door closed
That old critterll be cruisin over here six nights out of five
from now on to tell Al just how to spin those yarns of his And hell
talkand talkand talk Aint it astonishin how such a feeblelookin
craft as he is can keep blowin off steam that way and still be able to
navigate

His wife took him to task The idea she protested of your callin
your own minister a critter I should think youd be ashamed   
But oh dear Im afraid he WILL be over here an awful lot

Her fears were realized Mr Kendall although not on hand six nights
out of five as the captain prophesied was a frequent visitor at
the Snow place As Alberts storywriting progressed the discussions
concerning the growth and development of the heros character became
more and more involved and spirited They were for the most part
confined when the minister was present to him and Mrs Snow and
Rachel Laban if he happened to be there sat well back in the corner
saying little except when appealed to and then answering with one of
his dry characteristic observations Captain Lote in the rocker his
legs crossed his hand stroking his beard and with the twinkle in his
eyes listened and spoke but seldom Occasionally when he and his
grandson exchanged glances the captain winked indicating appreciation
of the situation

Say Al he said one evening after the old clergyman had departed
it must be kind of restful to have your work all laid out for you this
way Take it tonight for instance I dont see but what everythings
planned for this young feller youre writin about so you nor he wont
have to think for yourselves for a hundred year or such matter Course
theres some little difference in the plans Rachel wants him to get
wrecked on an island or be put in jail and Mother she wants him to be
a soldier and a poet and Mr Kendall thinks its high time he joined
the church or signed the pledge or stopped swearin or chewin gum

Zelotes how ridiculous you do talk

All right Mother all right What strikes me Al is they dont any of
em stop to ask you what YOU mean to have him do Course I know taint
any of your business but stillseems s if you might be a little mite
interested in the boy yourself

Albert laughed Dont worry Grandfather he said Im enjoying it
all very much And some of the suggestions may be just what Im looking
for

Well son well hope so Say Labe Ive got a notion for keepin the
minister from doin all the talkin Well ask Issy Price to drop in
eh

Laban shook his head I dont know Capn Lote he observed Sounds
to me a good deal like lettin in a hurricane to blow out a match with
   Umhm Seems so to me Yes yes

Mr Kendalls calls would have been more frequent still had Helen not
interfered Very often when he came she herself dropped in a little
later and insisted upon his making an early start for home Occasionally
she came with him She too seemed much interested in the progress of
the stories but she offered few suggestions When directly appealed to
she expressed her views and they were worth while

Albert was resolutely adhering to his determination not to permit
himself to think of her except as a friend That is he hoped he was
thoughts are hard to control at times He saw her often They met on the
street at church on Sundayhis grandmother was so delighted when he
accompanied her to meeting that he did so rather more frequently
perhaps than he otherwise wouldat the homes of acquaintances and of
course at the Snow place When she walked home with her father after a
story evening he usually went with them as additional escort

She had not questioned him concerning Madeline since their first meeting
that morning at the parsonage He knew therefore that some onehis
grandmother probablyhad told her of the broken engagement When
they were alone together they talked of many things casual things the
generalities of which so he told himself a conversation between mere
friends was composed But occasionally after doing escort duty after
Mr Kendall had gone into the house to take his throat medicinea
medicine which Captain Zelotes declared would have to be doublestrength
pretty soon to offset the wear and tear of the story eveningsthey
talked of matters more specific and which more directly concerned
themselves She spoke of her hospital work of her teaching before the
war and of her plans for the future The latter of course were very
indefinite now

Father needs me she said and I shall not leave him while he lives

They spoke of Alberts work and plans most of all He began to ask for
advice concerning the former When those stories were written what
then She hoped he would try the novel he had hinted at

Im sure you can do it she said And you mustnt give up the poems
altogether It was the poetry you know which was the beginning

YOU were the beginning he said impulsively Perhaps I should
never have written at all if you hadnt urged me shamed me out of my
laziness

I was a presuming young person Im afraid she said I wonder
you didnt tell me to mind my own business I believe you did but I
wouldnt mind

June brought the summer weather and the summer boarders to South
Harniss One of the news sensations which came at the same time was that
the new Fosdick cottage had been sold The people who had occupied it
the previous season had bought it Mrs Fosdick so rumor said was not
strong and her doctors had decided that the sea air did not agree with
her

Crimustee exclaimed Issachar as he imparted the news to Mr Keeler
if that aint the worst Spend your money and a pile of money too
buyin ground layin of it out to build a house on to live in then
buildin that house and then by crimus sellin it to somebody else for
THEM to live in That beats any foolishness ever come MY way

And theres some considerble come your way at that aint they Is
observed Laban busy with his bookkeeping

Issachar nodded Youre right there has he said complacently
I    What do you mean by that Tryin to be funny again aint you

Albert heard the news with a distinct feeling of relief While the
feeling on his part toward Madeline was of the kindliest and Madelines
was he felt sure the same toward him nevertheless to meet her
day after day as people must meet in a village no bigger than South
Harniss would be awkward for both And to meet Mrs Fosdick might be
more awkward still He smiled as he surmised that the realization by the
lady of that very awkwardness was probably responsible for the discovery
that sea air was not beneficial

The storywriting and the story evenings continued Over the fourth
story in the series discussion was warm for there were marked
differences of opinion among the listeners One of the experiences
through which Albert had brought his hero was that of working as general
assistant to a sharp unscrupulous and smoothtongued rascal who was
proprietor of a circus sideshow and fake museum He was a kindhearted
swindler but one who never let a question of honesty interfere with the
getting of a dollar In this fourth story to the town where the hero
now a man of twentyfive had established himself in business came this
cheat of other days but now he came as a duly ordained clergyman in
answer to the call of the local church The hero learned that he had not
told the governing body of that church of his former career Had he done
so they most certainly would not have called him The leading man in
that church body was the heros patron and kindest friend The question
What was the heros duty in the matter

Of course the first question asked was whether or not the exsideshow
proprietor was sincerely repentant and honestly trying to walk the
straight path and lead others along it Albert replied that his hero had
interviewed him and was satisfied that he was he had been converted
at a revival and was now a religious enthusiast whose one idea was to
save sinners

That was enough for Captain Zelotes

Let him alone then said the captain Hes tryin to be a decent
man What do you want to do Tell on him and have him chucked overboard
from one church after another until he gets discouraged and takes to
swindlin again

Rachel Ellis could not see it that way

If he was a saved sinner she declared and repentant of his sins
then hed ought to repent em out loud Hidin em aint repentin And
besides theres Donalds Donald was the heros name theres Donalds
duty to the man thats been so good to him Is it fair to that man to
keep still and let him hire a minister that like as not will steal the
collection box and all afore he gets through No sir Donald ought to
tell THAT man anyhow

Olive was pretty dubious about the whole scheme She doubted if anybody
connected with a circus COULD ever become a minister

The wholeerertrade is so different she said

Mr Kendall was not there that evening his attendance being required at
a meeting of the Sunday School teachers Helen however was not at that
meeting and Captain Zelotes declared his intention of asking her opinion
by telephone

Shell say same as I doyou see if she dont he declared When
he called the parsonage however Maria Price answered the phone and
informed him that Helen was spending the evening with old Mrs Crowell
who lived but a little way from the Snow place The captain promptly
called up the Crowell house

Shes there and shell stop in here on her way along he said
triumphantly And shell back me upyou see

But she did not She did not back up any one She merely smiled and
declared the problem too complicated to answer offhand

Why dont you ask Albert she inquired After all he is the one who
must settle it eventually

He wont tell said Olive Hes real provokin isnt he And now you
wont tell either Helen

Oh I dont knowyet But I think he does

Albert as usual walked home with her

How are you going to answer your heros riddle she asked

Before I tell you suppose you tell me what your answer would be

She reflected Well she said it seems to me that all things being
as they are he should do this He should go to the sideshow manthe
minister nowand have a very frank talk with him He should tell him
that he had decided to say nothing about the old life and to help him
in every way to be his friendprovided that he keep straight that is
all Of course more than that would be meant the alternative would be
there and understood but he need not say it I think that course of
action would be fair to himself and to everybody That is my answer
What is yours

He laughed quietly Just that of course he said You would see it
I knew You always see down to the heart of things Helen You have the
gift

She shook her head It didnt really need a gift this particular
problem did it she said It is notexcuse meit isnt exactly a
new one

No it isnt It is as old as the hills but there are always new
twists to it

As there are to all our old problems

Yes By the way your advice about the ending of my third story was
exactly what I needed The editor wrote me he should never have forgiven
me if it had ended in any other way It probably WOULD have ended in
another way if it hadnt been for you Thank you Helen

Oh you know there was really nothing to thank me for It was all you
as usual Have you planned the next story the fifth yet

Not entirely I have some vague ideas Do you want to hear them

Of course

So they discussed those ideas as they walked along the sidewalk of the
street leading down to the parsonage It was a warm evening a light
mist which was not substantial enough to be a fog hanging low over
everything wrapping them and the trees and the little front yards and
low houses of the old village in a sort of cozy velvety confidential
quiet The scent of lilacs was heavy in the air

They both were silent Just when they had ceased speaking neither could
have told They walked on arm in arm and suddenly Albert became aware
that this silence was dangerous for him that in it all his resolves and
brave determinations were melting into mist like that about him that
he must talk and talk at once and upon a subject which was not personal
which

And then Helen spoke

Do you know what this reminds me of she said All this talk of ours
It reminds me of how we used to talk over those first poems of yours
You have gone a long way since then

I have gone to Kaiserville and back

You know what I mean I mean your work has improved wonderfully You
write with a sure hand now it seems to me And your view is so much
broader

I hope Im not the narrow conceited little rooster I used to be I
told you Helen that the war handed me an awful jolt Well it did I
think it or my sickness or the whole business together knocked most of
that selfconfidence of mine galleywest For so much Im thankful

I dont know that I am altogether I dont want you to lose confidence
in yourself You should be confident now because you deserve to be And
you write with confidence or it reads as if you did Dont you feel
that you do yourself Truly dont you

Well perhaps a little I have been at it for some time now I ought
to show some progress Perhaps I dont make as many mistakes

I cant see that you have made any

I have made one    a damnable one

Why what do you mean

Oh nothing I didnt mean to say that    Helen do you know it is
awfully good of you to take all this interest in mein my work I mean
Why do you do it

Why

Yes why

Why becauseWhy shouldnt I Havent we always talked about your
writings together almost since we first knew each other Arent we old
friends

There it was againfriends It was like a splash of cold water in the
face at once awakening and chilling Albert walked on in silence for
a few moments and then began speaking of some trivial subject entirely
disconnected with himself or his work or her When they reached the
parsonage door he said good night at once and strode off toward home

Back in his room however he gave himself another mental picking to
pieces He was realizing most distinctly that this sort of thing would
not do It was easy to say that his attitude toward Helen Kendall was
to be that of a friend and nothing more but it was growing harder and
harder to maintain that attitude He had come within a breath that very
night of saying what was in his heart

Well if he had said it if he did say itwhat then After all was
there any real reason why he should not say it It was true that he had
loved or fancied that he loved Madeline that he had been betrothed to
herbut again what of it Broken engagements were common enough and
there was nothing disgraceful in this one Why not go to Helen and tell
her that his fancied love for Madeline had been the damnable mistake he
had confessed making Why not tell her that since the moment when he saw
her standing in the doorway of the parsonage on the morning following
his return from New York he had known that she was the only woman in the
world for him that it was her image he had seen in his dreams in the
delirium of fever that it was she and not that other who

But there all this was foolishness and he knew it He did not dare say
it Not for one instant had she by speech or look or action given him
the slightest encouragement to think her feeling for him was anything
but friendship And that friendship was far too precious to risk He
must not risk it He must keep still he must hide his thoughts she
must never guess Some day perhaps after a year or two after his
position in his profession was more assured then he might speak But
even then there would be that risk And the idea of waiting was not
pleasant What had Rachel told him concerning the hosts of doctors and
officers and generals who had been shining up to her Some risk there
also

Well never mind He would try to keep on as he had been going for the
present He would try not to see her as frequently If the strain became
unbearable he might go away somewherefor a time

He did not go away but he made it a point not to see her as frequently
However they met often even as it was And he was conscious always that
the ice beneath his feet was very very thin

One wonderful August evening he was in his room upstairs He was not
writing He had come up there early because he wished to think
to consider A proposition had been made to him that afternoon a
surprising propositionto him it had come as a complete surpriseand
before mentioning it even to his grandparents he wished to think it over
very carefully

About ten oclock his grandfather called to him from the foot of the
stairs and asked him to come down

Mr Kendalls on the phone said Captain Zelotes Hes worried about
Helen Shes up to West Harniss sittin up along of Lurany Howes whos
been sick so long She aint come home and the old gentlemans frettin
about her walkin down from there alone so late I told him I callated
youd just as soon harness Jess and drive up and get her You talk with
him yourself Al

Albert did and after assuring the nervous clergyman that he would see
that his daughter reached home safely put on his hat and went out to
the barn Jessamine was asleep in her stall As he was about to lead
her out he suddenly remembered that one of the traces had broken that
morning and Captain Zelotes had left it at the harnessmakers to be
mended It was there yet The captain had forgotten the fact and so had
he That settled the idea of using Jessamine and the buggy Never mind
it was a beautiful night and the walk was but little over a mile

When he reached the tiny storyandahalf Howes cottage sitting back
from the road upon the knoll amid the tangle of silverleaf sprouts it
was Helen herself who opened the door She was surprised to see him and
when he explained his errand she was a little vexed

The idea of Fathers worrying she said Such a wonderful night as
this bright moonlight and in South Harniss too Nothing ever happens
to people in South Harniss I will be ready in a minute or two Mrs
Howes niece is here now and will stay with her until tomorrow Then
her sister is coming to stay a month As soon as I get her medicine
ready we can go

The door of the tiny bedroom adjoining the sitting room was open and
Albert sitting upon the lounge with the faded likeness of a pink
dog printed on the plush cover could hear the querulous voice of the
invalid within The widow Howes was deaf and as Laban Keeler described
it always hollered loud enough to make herself hear when she spoke
Helen was moving quietly about the sick room and speaking in a low tone
Albert could not hear what she said but he could hear Lurania

Youre a wonder thats what you be declared the latter and I told
your pa so last time he was here Shes a saint says I if ever
there was one on this earth Shes the nicest smartest bestlookin
girl in THIS town and    eh

There had been a murmur presumably of remonstrance from Helen

Eh

Another murmur

EH WHOD you say was there

A third murmur

WHO    Oh that Speranzy one Lote Snows grandson The one they
used to call the Portygee    Eh Well all right I dont care if
he did hear me If he dont know youre nice and smart and goodlookin
its high time he did

Helen a trifle embarrassed but laughing emerged a moment later and
when she had put on her hat she and Albert left the Howes cottage and
began their walk home It was one of those nights such as Cape Codders
yearrounders or visitors experience three or four times during a
summer and boast of the remainder of the year A sky clear deep
stretched cloudless from horizon to horizon Every light at sea or on
shore in cottage window or at masthead or in lighthouse or on lightship
a twinkling diamond point A moon apparently as big as a barrelhead
hung up in the east and below it a carpet of cold fire of dancing
spangled silver spread upon the ocean The sound of the surf distant
soothing and for the rest quiet and the fragrance of the summer woods
and fields

They walked rather fast at first and the conversation was brisk but as
the night began to work its spell upon them their progress was slower
and there were intervals of silence of which neither was aware They
came to the little hill where the narrow road from West Harniss comes to
join the broader highway leading to the Center There were trees here
a pine grove on the landward side and toward the sea nothing to break
the glorious view

Helen caught her breath Oh it is beautiful beautiful she said

Albert did not answer Why dont you talk she asked What are you
thinking about

He did not tell her what he was thinking about Instead having caught
himself just in time he began telling her of what he had been thinking
when his grandfather called him to the telephone

Helen he said I want to ask your advice I had an astonishing
proposal made to me this afternoon I must make a decision I must say
yes or no and Im not sure which to say

She looked up at him inquiringly

This afternoon he went on Doctor Parker called me into his office
There was a group of men there prominent men in politics from about the
country Judge Baxter from Ostable was there and Captain Warren from
South Denboro and others like them What do you suppose they want me to
do

I cant imagine

They offer me the party nomination for Congress from this section That
is of course they want me to permit my name to stand and they seem
sure my nomination will be confirmed by the voters The nomination they
say is equivalent to election They seem certain of it    And they
were insistent that I accept

Ohoh Albert

Yes They said a good many flattering things things I should like to
believe They said my war record and my writing and all that had made
me a prominent man in the countyPlease dont think I take any stock in
that

But _I_ do Go on

Well that is all They seemed confident that I would make a good
congressman I am not so sure Of course the thing    well it does
tempt me I confess I could keep on with my writing of course I
should have to leave the home people for a part of the year but I could
be with them or near them the rest And    well Helen II think
I should like the job Just now when America needs Americans and the
thing that isnt American must be fought I should likeif I were sure
I was capable of it

Oh but you areyou ARE

Do you really think so Would you like to have me try

He felt her arm tremble upon his She drew a long breath

Oh I should be so PROUD she breathed

There was a quiver in her voice almost a sob He bent toward her She
was looking off toward the sea the moonlight upon her face was like a
glory her eyes were shiningand there were tears in them His heart
throbbed wildly

Helen he cried Helen

She turned and looked up into his face The next moment her own face was
hidden against his breast his arms were about her and    and the
risk the risk he had feared to take was taken

They walked home after a time but it was a slow a very slow walk with
many interruptions

Oh Helen he kept saying I dont see how you can How can you In
spite of it all II treated you so badly I was SUCH an idiot And you
really care You really do

She laughed happily I really do    and    and I really have all
the time

Always

Always

Wellwell by George And    Helen do you know I thinkI think I
did tooalwaysonly I was such a young fool I didnt realize it WHAT
a young fool I was

Dont say that dear dont    You are going to be a great man
You are a famous one already you are going to be great Dont you know
that

He stooped and kissed her

I think I shall have to be he said if I am going to be worthy of
you



CHAPTER XX


Albert sitting in the private office of Z Snow and Co dropped his
newspaper and looked up with a smile as his grandfather came in Captain
Zelotes florid face was redder even than usual for it was a cloudy day
in October and blowing a gale

Whew puffed the captain pulling off his overcoat and striding over
to warm his hands at the stove its raw as January comin over the
tops of those Trumet hills and blowin hard enough to part your back
hair besides One time there I didnt know but Id have to reef
callate I would if Id known how to reef an automobile

Is the car running as well as ever asked Albert

You bet you Took all but two of those hills on full steam and never
slowed down a mite Think of goin to Trumet and back in a forenoon
and havin time enough to do the talkin I went to do besides Why Jess
would have needed the whole day to make the down cruise to say nothin
of the return trip Well the old gals havin a good rest now nothin
much to do but eat and sleep She deserves it shes been a good horse
for your grandma and me

He rubbed his hands before the stove and chuckled

Olives still scared to death for fear Ill get run into or run over
somebody or somethin he observed I tell her I can navigate that car
now the way I used to navigate the old President Hayes and I could
do that walkin in my sleep Theres a little exaggeration there he
added with a grin It takes about all my gumption when Im wide awake
to turn the flivver around in a narrow road but I manage to do it  
 Well what are you doin in here Al he added Readin the Items
prophesy about how big your majoritys goin to be

Albert smiled I dropped in here to wait for you Grandfather he
replied The novelwriting mill wasnt working particularly well so I
gave it up and took a walk

To the parsonage I presume likely

Well I did stop there for a minute or two

You dont say Im surprised to hear it How is Helen this mornin Did
she think youd changed much since you saw her last night

I dont know She didnt say so if she did She sent her love to you
and Grandmother

What she had left over you mean

And said to tell you not to tire yourself out electioneering for
me That was good advice too Grandfather dont you know that you
shouldnt motor all the way to Trumet and back a morning like this Id
rathermuch rather go without the votes than have you do such things

Captain Zelotes seated himself in his desk chair

But you aint goin to do without em he chuckled Obed Nyehes
chairman of the Trumet committeefiggers youll have a fivetoone
majority He told me to practice callin you the Honorable because
thats what youd be by Tuesday night of week after next And next
winter Mother and I will be takin a trip to Washinton so as to set
in the gallery and listen to you makin speeches Well be some
considerble proud of you too boy he added with a nod

His grandson looked away out of the window over the bleak yard with
its piles of lumber The voice of Issacher raised in expostulation with
the driver of Cahoons truckwagon could be faintly heard

I shall hate to leave you and Grandmother and the old place he said
If I am elected

WHEN youre elected there isnt any if

Well all right I shall hate to leave South Harniss Every person I
really care for will be here Helenand you people at home

Its too bad you and Helen cant be married and go to Washinton
together Not to stay permanent he added quickly but just while
Congress is in session Your grandma says then shed feel as if you had
somebody to look after you She always figgers you know that a man
aint capable of lookin out for himself Thered ought to be at least
one woman to take care of him see that he dont get his feet wet and
goes to meetin reglar and so on if there could be two so much the
better Mother would have made a pretty good Mormon in some ways

Albert laughed Helen feels she must stay with her father for the
present he said Of course she is right Perhaps by and by we can
find some good capable housekeeper to share the responsibility but not
this winter IF I am sent to Washington I shall come back often you may
be sure

When ARE you callatin to be married if that aint a secret

Perhaps next spring Certainly next fall It will depend upon Mr
Kendalls health But Grandfather I do feel rather like a deserter
going off and leaving you here

Good Lord You dont callate IM breakin down runnin strong to talk
and weakenin everywhere else like old Minister Kendall do you

Well hardly But    well you see I have felt a little ungrateful
ever since I came back from the war In a way I am sorry that I feel I
must give myself entirely to my writingand my political work I wish
I might have gone on here in this office accepted that partnership you
would have given me

You can have it yet you know Might take it and just keep it to fall
back on in case that storymill of yours busts altogether or all hands
in Ostable County go crazy and vote the wrong ticket Just take it and
wait Always well to have an anchor ready to let go you know

Thanks but that wouldnt be fair I wish I MIGHT have taken itfor
your sake I wish for your sake I were so constituted as to be good for
something at it Of course I dont mean by that that I should be willing
to give up my writingbutwell you see Grandfather I owe you an
awful lot in this world    and I know you had set your heart on my
being your partner in Z Snow and Co I know youre disappointed

Captain Lote did not answer instantly He seemed to be thinking Then
he opened a drawer in his desk and took out a box of cigars similar to
those he had offered the Honorable Fletcher Fosdick on the occasion of
their memorable interview

Smoke Al he asked Albert declined because of the nearness to dinner
time but the captain who never permitted meals or anything else to
interfere with his smoking lighted one of the cigars and leaned back in
his chair puffing steadily

Well Al he said slowly Ill tell you about that There was a
timeIll own up that there was a time when the idea you wasnt goin
to turn out a business man and the partner who would take over this
concern after I got my clearance papers was a notion I wouldnt let
myself think of for a minute I wouldnt THINK of it thats all But
Ive changed my mind about that as I have about some other things He
paused tugged at his beard and then added And I guess likely I might
as well own up to the whole truth while Im about it I didnt change it
because I wanted to but because I couldnt help ittwas changed for
me

He made this statement more as if he were thinking aloud than as if he
expected a reply A moment later he continued

Yes sir he said twas changed for me And with a shrug Id
rather prided myself that when my mind was made up it stayed that way
Butbut well consarn it Ive about come to the conclusion that I was
a pigheaded old fool Al in some ways

Nonsense Grandfather You are the last man to

Oh I dont mean a candidate for the feebleminded school There aint
been any Snows put there that I can remember not our branch of em
anyhow But consarn it II he was plainly finding it hard to
express his thought Iwell I used to think I knew considerble
had what I liked to think was good hard sense Twas hard enough I
callatepretty nigh petrified in spots

Albert laid a hand on his knee

Dont talk like that he replied impulsively I dont like to hear
you

Dont you Then I wont But you see Al it bothers me Look how I
used to talk about makin up poetry and writin yarns and all that Used
to call it silliness and a waste of time I didworse names than that
generally And look what youre makin at it in money to say nothin of
its shovin you into Congress and keepin the newspapers busy printin
stuff about you    Well well with a sigh of resignation I dont
understand it yet but know its so and if Id had my pigheaded way
twouldnt have been so Its a dreadful belittlin feelin to a man at
my time of life a man thats commanded tenthousandton steamers and
handled crews and bossed a business like this It makes him wonder how
many other fool things hes done    Why do you know Al he added
in a sudden burst of confidence I was considerble prejudiced against
you when you first came here

He made the statement as if he expected it to come as a stunning
surprise Albert would not have laughed for the world nor in one way
did he feel like it but it was funny

Well perhaps you were a little he said gravely I dont wonder

Oh I dont mean just because you was your fathers son I mean on your
own account in a way Somehow you see I couldnt believeeh Oh
come in Labe Its all right Al and I are just talkin about nothin
in particular and all creation in general

Mr Keeler entered with a paper in his hand

Sorry to bother you Capn Lote he said but this bill of Colby and
Sons for that last lot of hardware aint accordin to agreement The
prices on those butts aint right and neithers those halfinch screws
Better send it back to em eh

Captain Zelotes inspected the bill

Humph he grunted Youre right Labe You generally are I notice
Yes send it back and tell emanything you want to

Laban smiled I want to all right he said This is the third time
theyve sent wrong bills inside of two months Well Al turning toward
him I callate this makes you kind of homesick dont it this talk
about bills and screws and bolts and such Want teasin for your old
job back again was you Al Callate he could have it couldnt he
Capn Well need somebody to heave a bucket of water on Issy pretty
soon hes gettin kind of pert and uppish again Pretty much so Yes
yes yes

He departed chuckling Captain Zelotes looked after him He tugged at
his beard

Al he said do you know what Ive about made up my mind to do

Albert shook his head

Ive about made up my mind to take Labe Keeler into the firm of Z Snow
and Co YOU wont come in and with a twinkle I need somebody to
keep my name from gettin lonesome on the sign

Albert was delighted

Bully for you Grandfather he exclaimed You couldnt do a better
thing for Labe or for the firm And he deserves it too

Yees I think he does Labes a mighty faithful capable feller and
now that hes sworn off on those vacations of his he can be trusted
anywheres Yes Ive as good as made up my mind to take him in Of
course with the twinkle in evidence once more Issacharll be a
little mite jealous but well have to bear up under that as best we
can

I wonder what Labe will say when you tell him

Hell say yes Ill tell Rachel first and shell tell him to say it
And then Ill tell em both I wont do it unless they agree to get
married Ive always said I didnt want to die till Id been to that
weddin I want to hear Rachel tell the minister shell obey Labe Ho
ho

Do you suppose they ever will be married

Why yes I kind of think so I shouldnt wonder if they would be right
off now if it wasnt that Rachel wouldnt think of givin up keepin
house for your grandmother She wouldnt do that and Labe wouldnt want
her to Ive got to fix that somehow Perhaps they could live along with
us Land knows theres room enough Theyre all right those two Kind
of funny to look at and they match up in size like a rubber boot and a
slipper but I declare I dont know which has got the most commonsense
or the biggest heart And twould be hard to tell which thinks the most
of you Al    Eh Why its after halfpast twelve oclock Olivell
be for combin our topknots with a belayin pin if we keep her dinner
waitin like this

As they were putting on their coats the captain spoke again

I hadnt finished what I was sayin to you when Labe came in he
observed Twasnt much account just a sort of confession and they
say thats good for the soul I was just goin to say that when you
first came here I was prejudiced against you not only because your
father and I didnt agree but because he was what he was Because he
waswas

Albert finished the sentence for him

A Portygee he said

Why yes thats what I called him Thats what I used to call about
everybody that wasnt born right down here in Yankeeland I used to be
prejudiced against you because you was what I called a halfbreed Im
sorry Al Im ashamed See what youve turned out to be I declare
I

Shh shh Dont Grandfather When I came here I was a little snob a
conceited insufferable little

Here here Hold on No you want neither Or if you was you was
only a boy I was a man and I ought to

No Im going to finish Whatever I am now or whatever I may be I owe
to you and to Grandmother and Rachel and Labanand Helen You made me
over between you I know that now

They walked home instead of riding in the new car Captain Zelotes
declared he had hung on to that steering wheel all the forenoon and he
was afraid if he took it again his fingers would grow fast to the rim
As they emerged from the office into the open air he said

Al regardin that makinover business I shouldnt be surprised if
it was a kind ofermutual thing between you and me We both had some
prejudices to get rid of eh

Perhaps so Im sure I did

And Im sartin sure I did And the war and all that came with it put
the finishin touches to the job When I think of what the thousands
and thousands of men did over there in those hellholes of trenches men
with names that run all the way from Jones and Kelly toer

Speranza

Yes and Whiskervitch and the land knows what more When I think of
that Im ready to take off my hat to em and swear Ill never be so
narrow again as to look down on a feller because he dont happen to be
born in Ostable County Theres only one thing I ask of em and that
is that when they come here to liveto stayunder our laws and takin
advantage of the privileges we offer emtheyll stop bein Portygees
or Russians or Polacks or whatever they used to be or their folks were
and just be Americanslike you Al

Thats what we must work for now Grandfather Its a big job but it
must be done

They walked on in silence for a time Then the captain said

Its a pretty fine country after all aint it Albert

Albert looked about him over the rolling hills the roofs of the little
town the sea the dunes the pine groves the scene which had grown so
familiar to him and which had become in his eyes so precious

It is MY country he declared with emphasis

His grandfather caught his meaning

Im glad you feel that way son he said but twasnt just South
Harniss I meant then I meant all of it the whole United States Its
got its faults of course lots of em And if I was an Englishman or
a Frenchman Id probably say it wasnt as good as England or France
whichever it happened to be Thats all right I aint findin any fault
with em for thatthats the way theyd ought to feel But you and I
Al were Americans So the rest of the world must excuse us if we say
that take it by and large its a mighty good country Weve planned
for it and worked for it and fought for it and we know Eh

Yes We know

Yes And no howlin wildeyed bunch from somewhere else that havent
done any of these things are goin to come here and run it their way if
we can help itwe Americans eh

Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza American drew a long breath

No he said with emphasis

You bet Well unless Im mistaken I smell salt fish and potatoes
which accordin to Cape Cod notion is a good American dinner I dont
know how you feel Al but Im hungry

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
