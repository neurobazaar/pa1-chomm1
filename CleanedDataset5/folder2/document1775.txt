SCENE
England and France



ACT I SCENE 1

KING JOHNs palace

Enter KING JOHN QUEEN ELINOR PEMBROKE ESSEX SALISBURY and
others
with CHATILLON

 KING JOHN Now say Chatillon what would France with us
 CHATILLON Thus after greeting speaks the King of France
 In my behaviour to the majesty
 The borrowed majesty of England here
 ELINOR A strange beginning borrowed majesty
 KING JOHN Silence good mother hear the embassy
 CHATILLON Philip of France in right and true behalf
 Of thy deceased brother Geffreys son
 Arthur Plantagenet lays most lawful claim
 To this fair island and the territories
 To Ireland Poictiers Anjou Touraine Maine
 Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
 Which sways usurpingly these several titles
 And put the same into young Arthurs hand
 Thy nephew and right royal sovereign
 KING JOHN What follows if we disallow of this
 CHATILLON The proud control of fierce and bloody war
 To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld
 KING JOHN Here have we war for war and blood for blood
 Controlment for controlment so answer France
 CHATILLON Then take my kings defiance from my mouth
 The farthest limit of my embassy
 KING JOHN Bear mine to him and so depart in peace
 Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France
 For ere thou canst report I will be there
 The thunder of my cannon shall be heard
 So hence Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
 And sullen presage of your own decay
 An honourable conduct let him have
 Pembroke look to t Farewell Chatillon
 Exeunt CHATILLON and
PEMBROKE
 ELINOR What now my son Have I not ever said
 How that ambitious Constance would not cease
 Till she had kindled France and all the world
 Upon the right and party of her son
 This might have been prevented and made whole
 With very easy arguments of love
 Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
 With fearful bloody issue arbitrate
 KING JOHN Our strong possession and our right for us
 ELINOR Your strong possession much more than your right
 Or else it must go wrong with you and me
 So much my conscience whispers in your ear
 Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear

 Enter a SHERIFF

 ESSEX My liege here is the strangest controversy
 Come from the country to be judgd by you
 That eer I heard Shall I produce the men
 KING JOHN Let them approach Exit
SHERIFF
 Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
 This expeditions charge

 Enter ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE and PHILIP his bastard
 brother

 What men are you
 BASTARD Your faithful subject I a gentleman
 Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son
 As I suppose to Robert Faulconbridge
 A soldier by the honourgiving hand
 Of Coeurdelion knighted in the field
 KING JOHN What art thou
 ROBERT The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge
 KING JOHN Is that the elder and art thou the heir
 You came not of one mother then it seems
 BASTARD Most certain of one mother mighty king
 That is well known and as I think one father
 But for the certain knowledge of that truth
 I put you oer to heaven and to my mother
 Of that I doubt as all mens children may
 ELINOR Out on thee rude man Thou dost shame thy mother
 And wound her honour with this diffidence
 BASTARD I madam No I have no reason for it
 That is my brothers plea and none of mine
 The which if he can prove a pops me out
 At least from fair five hundred pound a year
 Heaven guard my mothers honour and my land
 KING JOHN A good blunt fellow Why being younger born
 Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance
 BASTARD I know not why except to get the land
 But once he slanderd me with bastardy
 But wheer I be as true begot or no
 That still I lay upon my mothers head
 But that I am as well begot my liege
 Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me
 Compare our faces and be judge yourself
 If old Sir Robert did beget us both
 And were our father and this son like him
 O old Sir Robert father on my knee
 I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee
 KING JOHN Why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here
 ELINOR He hath a trick of Coeurdelions face
 The accent of his tongue affecteth him
 Do you not read some tokens of my son
 In the large composition of this man
 KING JOHN Mine eye hath well examined his parts
 And finds them perfect Richard Sirrah speak
 What doth move you to claim your brothers land
 BASTARD Because he hath a halfface like my father
 With half that face would he have all my land
 A halffacd groat five hundred pound a year
 ROBERT My gracious liege when that my father livd
 Your brother did employ my father much
 BASTARD Well sir by this you cannot get my land
 Your tale must be how he employd my mother
 ROBERT And once dispatchd him in an embassy
 To Germany there with the Emperor
 To treat of high affairs touching that time
 Th advantage of his absence took the King
 And in the meantime sojournd at my fathers
 Where how he did prevail I shame to speak
 But truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores
 Between my father and my mother lay
 As I have heard my father speak himself
 When this same lusty gentleman was got
 Upon his deathbed he by will bequeathd
 His lands to me and took it on his death
 That this my mothers son was none of his
 And if he were he came into the world
 Full fourteen weeks before the course of time
 Then good my liege let me have what is mine
 My fathers land as was my fathers will
 KING JOHN Sirrah your brother is legitimate
 Your fathers wife did after wedlock bear him
 And if she did play false the fault was hers
 Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
 That marry wives Tell me how if my brother
 Who as you say took pains to get this son
 Had of your father claimd this son for his
 In sooth good friend your father might have kept
 This calf bred from his cow from all the world
 In sooth he might then if he were my brothers
 My brother might not claim him nor your father
 Being none of his refuse him This concludes
 My mothers son did get your fathers heir
 Your fathers heir must have your fathers land
 ROBERT Shall then my fathers will be of no force
 To dispossess that child which is not his
 BASTARD Of no more force to dispossess me sir
 Than was his will to get me as I think
 ELINOR Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
 And like thy brother to enjoy thy land
 Or the reputed son of Coeurdelion
 Lord of thy presence and no land beside
 BASTARD Madam an if my brother had my shape
 And I had his Sir Roberts his like him
 And if my legs were two such ridingrods
 My arms such eelskins stuffd my face so thin
 That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
 Lest men should say Look where threefarthings goes
 And to his shape were heir to all this land
 Would I might never stir from off this place
 I would give it every foot to have this face
 I would not be Sir Nob in any case
 ELINOR I like thee well Wilt thou forsake thy fortune
 Bequeath thy land to him and follow me
 I am a soldier and now bound to France
 BASTARD Brother take you my land Ill take my chance
 Your face hath got five hundred pound a year
 Yet sell your face for fivepence and tis dear
 Madam Ill follow you unto the death
 ELINOR Nay I would have you go before me thither
 BASTARD Our country manners give our betters way
 KING JOHN What is thy name
 BASTARD Philip my liege so is my name begun
 Philip good old Sir Roberts wifes eldest son
 KING JOHN From henceforth bear his name whose form thou
bearest
 Kneel thou down Philip but rise more great
 Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet
 BASTARD Brother by th mothers side give me your hand
 My father gave me honour yours gave land
 Now blessed be the hour by night or day
 When I was got Sir Robert was away
 ELINOR The very spirit of Plantagenet
 I am thy grandam Richard call me so
 BASTARD Madam by chance but not by truth what though
 Something about a little from the right
 In at the window or else oer the hatch
 Who dares not stir by day must walk by night
 And have is have however men do catch
 Near or far off well won is still well shot
 And I am I howeer I was begot
 KING JOHN Go Faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire
 A landless knight makes thee a landed squire
 Come madam and come Richard we must speed
 For France for France for it is more than need
 BASTARD Brother adieu Good fortune come to thee
 For thou wast got i th way of honesty
 Exeunt all but the
BASTARD
 A foot of honour better than I was
 But many a many foot of land the worse
 Well now can I make any Joan a lady
 Good den Sir RichardGodamercy fellow
 And if his name be George Ill call him Peter
 For newmade honour doth forget mens names
 Tis too respective and too sociable
 For your conversion Now your traveller
 He and his toothpick at my worships mess
 And when my knightly stomach is sufficd
 Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
 My picked man of countries My dear sir
 Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
 I shall beseech youThat is question now
 And then comes answer like an ABC book
 O sir says answer at your best command
 At your employment at your service sir
 No sir says question I sweet sir at yours
 And so ere answer knows what question would
 Saving in dialogue of compliment
 And talking of the Alps and Apennines
 The Pyrenean and the river Po
 It draws toward supper in conclusion so
 But this is worshipful society
 And fits the mounting spirit like myself
 For he is but a bastard to the time
 That doth not smack of observation
 And so am I whether I smack or no
 And not alone in habit and device
 Exterior form outward accoutrement
 But from the inward motion to deliver
 Sweet sweet sweet poison for the ages tooth
 Which though I will not practise to deceive
 Yet to avoid deceit I mean to learn
 For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising
 But who comes in such haste in ridingrobes
 What womanpost is this Hath she no husband
 That will take pains to blow a horn before her

 Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and JAMES GURNEY

 O me tis my mother How now good lady
 What brings you here to court so hastily
 LADY FAULCONBRIDGE Where is that slave thy brother
 Where is he
 That holds in chase mine honour up and down
 BASTARD My brother Robert old Sir Roberts son
 Colbrand the giant that same mighty man
 Is it Sir Roberts son that you seek so
 LADY FAULCONBRIDGE Sir Roberts son Ay thou unreverend boy
 Sir Roberts son Why scornst thou at Sir Robert
 He is Sir Roberts son and so art thou
 BASTARD James Gurney wilt thou give us leave awhile
 GURNEY Good leave good Philip
 BASTARD PhilipSparrow James
 Theres toys abroadanon Ill tell thee more
 Exit
GURNEY
 Madam I was not old Sir Roberts son
 Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
 Upon Good Friday and neer broke his fast
 Sir Robert could do wellmarry to confess
 Could he get me Sir Robert could not do it
 We know his handiwork Therefore good mother
 To whom am I beholding for these limbs
 Sir Robert never holp to make this leg
 LADY FAULCONBRIDGE Hast thou conspired with thy brother too
 That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour
 What means this scorn thou most untoward knave
 BASTARD Knight knight good mother Basiliscolike
 What I am dubbd I have it on my shoulder
 But mother I am not Sir Roberts son
 I have disclaimd Sir Robert and my land
 Legitimation name and all is gone
 Then good my mother let me know my father
 Some proper man I hope Who was it mother
 LADY FAULCONBRIDGE Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge
 BASTARD As faithfully as I deny the devil
 LADY FAULCONBRIDGE King Richard Coeurdelion was thy father
 By long and vehement suit I was seducd
 To make room for him in my husbands bed
 Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge
 Thou art the issue of my dear offence
 Which was so strongly urgd past my defence
 BASTARD Now by this light were I to get again
 Madam I would not wish a better father
 Some sins do bear their privilege on earth
 And so doth yours your fault was not your folly
 Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose
 Subjected tribute to commanding love
 Against whose fury and unmatched force
 The aweless lion could not wage the fight
 Nor keep his princely heart from Richards hand
 He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
 May easily win a womans Ay my mother
 With all my heart I thank thee for my father
 Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
 When I was got Ill send his soul to hell
 Come lady I will show thee to my kin
 And they shall say when Richard me begot
 If thou hadst said him nay it had been sin
 Who says it was he lies I say twas not
Exeunt

ACT II SCENE 1

France Before Angiers

Enter on one side AUSTRIA and forces on the other KING PHILIP
OF FRANCE
LEWIS the Dauphin CONSTANCE ARTHUR and forces

 KING PHILIP Before Angiers well met brave Austria
 Arthur that great forerunner of thy blood
 Richard that robbd the lion of his heart
 And fought the holy wars in Palestine
 By this brave duke came early to his grave
 And for amends to his posterity
 At our importance hither is he come
 To spread his colours boy in thy behalf
 And to rebuke the usurpation
 Of thy unnatural uncle English John
 Embrace him love him give him welcome hither
 ARTHUR God shall forgive you Coeurdelions death
 The rather that you give his offspring life
 Shadowing their right under your wings of war
 I give you welcome with a powerless hand
 But with a heart full of unstained love
 Welcome before the gates of Angiers Duke
 KING PHILIP A noble boy Who would not do thee right
 AUSTRIA Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
 As seal to this indenture of my love
 That to my home I will no more return
 Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France
 Together with that pale that whitefacd shore
 Whose foot spurns back the oceans roaring tides
 And coops from other lands her islanders
 Even till that England hedgd in with the main
 That waterwalled bulwark still secure
 And confident from foreign purposes
 Even till that utmost corner of the west
 Salute thee for her king Till then fair boy
 Will I not think of home but follow arms
 CONSTANCE O take his mothers thanks a widows thanks
 Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
 To make a more requital to your love
 AUSTRIA The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
 In such a just and charitable war
 KING PHILIP Well then to work Our cannon shall be bent
 Against the brows of this resisting town
 Call for our chiefest men of discipline
 To cull the plots of best advantages
 Well lay before this town our royal bones
 Wade to the marketplace in Frenchmens blood
 But we will make it subject to this boy
 CONSTANCE Stay for an answer to your embassy
 Lest unadvisd you stain your swords with blood
 My Lord Chatillon may from England bring
 That right in peace which here we urge in war
 And then we shall repent each drop of blood
 That hot rash haste so indirectly shed

 Enter CHATILLON

 KING PHILIP A wonder lady Lo upon thy wish
 Our messenger Chatillon is arrivd
 What England says say briefly gentle lord
 We coldly pause for thee Chatillon speak
 CHATILLON Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
 And stir them up against a mightier task
 England impatient of your just demands
 Hath put himself in arms The adverse winds
 Whose leisure I have stayd have given him time
 To land his legions all as soon as I
 His marches are expedient to this town
 His forces strong his soldiers confident
 With him along is come the motherqueen
 An Ate stirring him to blood and strife
 With her the Lady Blanch of Spain
 With them a bastard of the kings deceasd
 And all th unsettled humours of the land
 Rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries
 With ladies faces and fierce dragons spleens
 Have sold their fortunes at their native homes
 Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs
 To make a hazard of new fortunes here
 In brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits
 Than now the English bottoms have waft oer
 Did never float upon the swelling tide
 To do offence and scathe in Christendom Drum
beats
 The interruption of their churlish drums
 Cuts off more circumstance they are at hand
 To parley or to fight therefore prepare
 KING PHILIP How much unlookd for is this expedition
 AUSTRIA By how much unexpected by so much
 We must awake endeavour for defence
 For courage mounteth with occasion
 Let them be welcome then we are prepard

 Enter KING JOHN ELINOR BLANCH the BASTARD
 PEMBROKE and others

 KING JOHN Peace be to France if France in peace permit
 Our just and lineal entrance to our own
 If not bleed France and peace ascend to heaven
 Whiles we Gods wrathful agent do correct
 Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven
 KING PHILIP Peace be to England if that war return
 From France to England there to live in peace
 England we love and for that Englands sake
 With burden of our armour here we sweat
 This toil of ours should be a work of thine
 But thou from loving England art so far
 That thou hast underwrought his lawful king
 Cut off the sequence of posterity
 Outfaced infant state and done a rape
 Upon the maiden virtue of the crown
 Look here upon thy brother Geffreys face
 These eyes these brows were moulded out of his
 This little abstract doth contain that large
 Which died in Geffrey and the hand of time
 Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume
 That Geffrey was thy elder brother born
 And this his son England was Geffreys right
 And this is Geffreys In the name of God
 How comes it then that thou art calld a king
 When living blood doth in these temples beat
 Which owe the crown that thou oermasterest
 KING JOHN From whom hast thou this great commission France
 To draw my answer from thy articles
 KING PHILIP From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
 In any breast of strong authority
 To look into the blots and stains of right
 That judge hath made me guardian to this boy
 Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong
 And by whose help I mean to chastise it
 KING JOHN Alack thou dost usurp authority
 KING PHILIP Excuse it is to beat usurping down
 ELINOR Who is it thou dost call usurper France
 CONSTANCE Let me make answer thy usurping son
 ELINOR Out insolent Thy bastard shall be king
 That thou mayst be a queen and check the world
 CONSTANCE My bed was ever to thy son as true
 As thine was to thy husband and this boy
 Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
 Than thou and John in mannersbeing as like
 As rain to water or devil to his dam
 My boy a bastard By my soul I think
 His father never was so true begot
 It cannot be an if thou wert his mother
 ELINOR Theres a good mother boy that blots thy father
 CONSTANCE Theres a good grandam boy that would blot thee
 AUSTRIA Peace
 BASTARD Hear the crier
 AUSTRIA What the devil art thou
 BASTARD One that will play the devil sir with you
 An a may catch your hide and you alone
 You are the hare of whom the proverb goes
 Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard
 Ill smoke your skincoat an I catch you right
 Sirrah look to t i faith I will i faith
 BLANCH O well did he become that lions robe
 That did disrobe the lion of that robe
 BASTARD It lies as sightly on the back of him
 As great Alcides shows upon an ass
 But ass Ill take that burden from your back
 Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack
 AUSTRIA What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
 With this abundance of superfluous breath
 King Philip determine what we shall do straight
 KING PHILIP Women and fools break off your conference
 King John this is the very sum of all
 England and Ireland Anjou Touraine Maine
 In right of Arthur do I claim of thee
 Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms
 KING JOHN My life as soon I do defy thee France
 Arthur of Britaine yield thee to my hand
 And out of my dear love Ill give thee more
 Than eer the coward hand of France can win
 Submit thee boy
 ELINOR Come to thy grandam child
 CONSTANCE Do child go to it grandam child
 Give grandam kingdom and it grandam will
 Give it a plum a cherry and a fig
 Theres a good grandam
 ARTHUR Good my mother peace
 I would that I were low laid in my grave
 I am not worth this coil thats made for me
 ELINOR His mother shames him so poor boy he weeps
 CONSTANCE Now shame upon you wheer she does or no
 His grandams wrongs and not his mothers shames
 Draws those heavenmoving pearls from his poor eyes
 Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee
 Ay with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribd
 To do him justice and revenge on you
 ELINOR Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth
 CONSTANCE Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth
 Call not me slanderer Thou and thine usurp
 The dominations royalties and rights
 Of this oppressed boy this is thy eldest sons son
 Infortunate in nothing but in thee
 Thy sins are visited in this poor child
 The canon of the law is laid on him
 Being but the second generation
 Removed from thy sinconceiving womb
 KING JOHN Bedlam have done
 CONSTANCE I have but this to say
 That he is not only plagued for her sin
 But God hath made her sin and her the plague
 On this removed issue plagued for her
 And with her plague her sin his injury
 Her injury the beadle to her sin
 All punishd in the person of this child
 And all for hera plague upon her
 ELINOR Thou unadvised scold I can produce
 A will that bars the title of thy son
 CONSTANCE Ay who doubts that A will a wicked will
 A womans will a cankred grandams will
 KING PHILIP Peace lady pause or be more temperate
 It ill beseems this presence to cry aim
 To these illtuned repetitions
 Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
 These men of Angiers let us hear them speak
 Whose title they admit Arthurs or Johns

 Trumpet sounds Enter citizens upon the walls

 CITIZEN Who is it that hath warnd us to the walls
 KING PHILIP Tis France for England
 KING JOHN England for itself
 You men of Angiers and my loving subjects
 KING PHILIP You loving men of Angiers Arthurs subjects
 Our trumpet calld you to this gentle parle
 KING JOHN For our advantage therefore hear us first
 These flags of France that are advanced here
 Before the eye and prospect of your town
 Have hither marchd to your endamagement
 The cannons have their bowels full of wrath
 And ready mounted are they to spit forth
 Their iron indignation gainst your walls
 All preparation for a bloody siege
 And merciless proceeding by these French
 Confront your citys eyes your winking gates
 And but for our approach those sleeping stones
 That as a waist doth girdle you about
 By the compulsion of their ordinance
 By this time from their fixed beds of lime
 Had been dishabited and wide havoc made
 For bloody power to rush upon your peace
 But on the sight of us your lawful king
 Who painfully with much expedient march
 Have brought a countercheck before your gates
 To save unscratchd your citys threatned cheeks
 Behold the French amazd vouchsafe a parle
 And now instead of bullets wrappd in fire
 To make a shaking fever in your walls
 They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke
 To make a faithless error in your ears
 Which trust accordingly kind citizens
 And let us inyour King whose labourd spirits
 Forwearied in this action of swift speed
 Craves harbourage within your city walls
 KING PHILIP When I have said make answer to us both
 Lo in this right hand whose protection
 Is most divinely vowd upon the right
 Of him it holds stands young Plantagenet
 Son to the elder brother of this man
 And king oer him and all that he enjoys
 For this downtrodden equity we tread
 In warlike march these greens before your town
 Being no further enemy to you
 Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
 In the relief of this oppressed child
 Religiously provokes Be pleased then
 To pay that duty which you truly owe
 To him that owes it namely this young prince
 And then our arms like to a muzzled bear
 Save in aspect hath all offence seald up
 Our cannons malice vainly shall be spent
 Against th invulnerable clouds of heaven
 And with a blessed and unvexd retire
 With unhackd swords and helmets all unbruisd
 We will bear home that lusty blood again
 Which here we came to spout against your town
 And leave your children wives and you in peace
 But if you fondly pass our profferd offer
 Tis not the roundure of your oldfacd walls
 Can hide you from our messengers of war
 Though all these English and their discipline
 Were harbourd in their rude circumference
 Then tell us shall your city call us lord
 In that behalf which we have challengd it
 Or shall we give the signal to our rage
 And stalk in blood to our possession
 CITIZEN In brief we are the King of Englands subjects
 For him and in his right we hold this town
 KING JOHN Acknowledge then the King and let me in
 CITIZEN That can we not but he that proves the King
 To him will we prove loyal Till that time
 Have we rammd up our gates against the world
 KING JOHN Doth not the crown of England prove the King
 And if not that I bring you witnesses
 Twice fifteen thousand hearts of Englands breed
 BASTARD Bastards and else
 KING JOHN To verify our title with their lives
 KING PHILIP As many and as wellborn bloods as those
 BASTARD Some bastards too
 KING PHILIP Stand in his face to contradict his claim
 CITIZEN Till you compound whose right is worthiest
 We for the worthiest hold the right from both
 KING JOHN Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
 That to their everlasting residence
 Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet
 In dreadful trial of our kingdoms king
 KING PHILIP Amen Amen Mount chevaliers to arms
 BASTARD Saint George that swingd the dragon and eer since
 Sits ons horse back at mine hostess door
 Teach us some fence To AUSTRIA Sirrah were I at home
 At your den sirrah with your lioness
 I would set an oxhead to your lions hide
 And make a monster of you
 AUSTRIA Peace no more
 BASTARD O tremble for you hear the lion roar
 KING JOHN Up higher to the plain where well set forth
 In best appointment all our regiments
 BASTARD Speed then to take advantage of the field
 KING PHILIP It shall be so and at the other hill
 Command the rest to stand God and our right
Exeunt

 Here after excursions enter the HERALD OF FRANCE
 with trumpets to the gates

 FRENCH HERALD You men of Angiers open wide your gates
 And let young Arthur Duke of Britaine in
 Who by the hand of France this day hath made
 Much work for tears in many an English mother
 Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground
 Many a widows husband grovelling lies
 Coldly embracing the discoloured earth
 And victory with little loss doth play
 Upon the dancing banners of the French
 Who are at hand triumphantly displayed
 To enter conquerors and to proclaim
 Arthur of Britaine Englands King and yours

 Enter ENGLISH HERALD with trumpet

 ENGLISH HERALD Rejoice you men of Angiers ring your bells
 King John your king and Englands doth approach
 Commander of this hot malicious day
 Their armours that marchd hence so silverbright
 Hither return all gilt with Frenchmens blood
 There stuck no plume in any English crest
 That is removed by a staff of France
 Our colours do return in those same hands
 That did display them when we first marchd forth
 And like a jolly troop of huntsmen come
 Our lusty English all with purpled hands
 Dyd in the dying slaughter of their foes
 Open your gates and give the victors way
 CITIZEN Heralds from off our towrs we might behold
 From first to last the onset and retire
 Of both your armies whose equality
 By our best eyes cannot be censured
 Blood hath bought blood and blows have answerd blows
 Strength matchd with strength and power confronted power
 Both are alike and both alike we like
 One must prove greatest While they weigh so even
 We hold our town for neither yet for both

 Enter the two KINGS with their powers at several doors

 KING JOHN France hast thou yet more blood to cast away
 Say shall the current of our right run on
 Whose passage vexd with thy impediment
 Shall leave his native channel and oerswell
 With course disturbd even thy confining shores
 Unless thou let his silver water keep
 A peaceful progress to the ocean
 KING PHILIP England thou hast not savd one drop of blood
 In this hot trial more than we of France
 Rather lost more And by this hand I swear
 That sways the earth this climate overlooks
 Before we will lay down our justborne arms
 Well put thee down gainst whom these arms we bear
 Or add a royal number to the dead
 Gracing the scroll that tells of this wars loss
 With slaughter coupled to the name of kings
 BASTARD Ha majesty how high thy glory towrs
 When the rich blood of kings is set on fire
 O now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel
 The swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs
 And now he feasts mousing the flesh of men
 In undetermind differences of kings
 Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
 Cry havoc kings back to the stained field
 You equal potents fiery kindled spirits
 Then let confusion of one part confirm
 The others peace Till then blows blood and death
 KING JOHN Whose party do the townsmen yet admit
 KING PHILIP Speak citizens for England whos your king
 CITIZEN The King of England when we know the King
 KING PHILIP Know him in us that here hold up his right
 KING JOHN In us that are our own great deputy
 And bear possession of our person here
 Lord of our presence Angiers and of you
 CITIZEN A greater powr than we denies all this
 And till it be undoubted we do lock
 Our former scruple in our strongbarrd gates
 Kingd of our fears until our fears resolvd
 Be by some certain king purgd and deposd
 BASTARD By heaven these scroyles of Angiers flout you kings
 And stand securely on their battlements
 As in a theatre whence they gape and point
 At your industrious scenes and acts of death
 Your royal presences be ruld by me
 Do like the mutines of Jerusalem
 Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
 Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town
 By east and west let France and England mount
 Their battering cannon charged to the mouths
 Till their soulfearing clamours have brawld down
 The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city
 Id play incessantly upon these jades
 Even till unfenced desolation
 Leave them as naked as the vulgar air
 That done dissever your united strengths
 And part your mingled colours once again
 Turn face to face and bloody point to point
 Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth
 Out of one side her happy minion
 To whom in favour she shall give the day
 And kiss him with a glorious victory
 How like you this wild counsel mighty states
 Smacks it not something of the policy
 KING JOHN Now by the sky that hangs above our heads
 I like it well France shall we knit our powrs
 And lay this Angiers even with the ground
 Then after fight who shall be king of it
 BASTARD An if thou hast the mettle of a king
 Being wrongd as we are by this peevish town
 Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery
 As we will ours against these saucy walls
 And when that we have dashd them to the ground
 Why then defy each other and pellmell
 Make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell
 KING PHILIP Let it be so Say where will you assault
 KING JOHN We from the west will send destruction
 Into this citys bosom
 AUSTRIA I from the north
 KING PHILIP Our thunder from the south
 Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town
 BASTARD Aside O prudent discipline From north to south
 Austria and France shoot in each others mouth
 Ill stir them to itCome away away
 CITIZEN Hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay
 And I shall show you peace and fairfacd league
 Win you this city without stroke or wound
 Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
 That here come sacrifices for the field
 Persever not but hear me mighty kings
 KING JOHN Speak on with favour we are bent to hear
 CITIZEN That daughter there of Spain the Lady Blanch
 Is niece to England look upon the years
 Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid
 If lusty love should go in quest of beauty
 Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch
 If zealous love should go in search of virtue
 Where should he find it purer than in Blanch
 If love ambitious sought a match of birth
 Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch
 Such as she is in beauty virtue birth
 Is the young Dauphin every way complete
 If not complete of say he is not she
 And she again wants nothing to name want
 If want it be not that she is not he
 He is the half part of a blessed man
 Left to be finished by such as she
 And she a fair divided excellence
 Whose fulness of perfection lies in him
 O two such silver currents when they join
 Do glorify the banks that bound them in
 And two such shores to two such streams made one
 Two such controlling bounds shall you be Kings
 To these two princes if you marry them
 This union shall do more than battery can
 To our fastclosed gates for at this match
 With swifter spleen than powder can enforce
 The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
 And give you entrance but without this match
 The sea enraged is not half so deaf
 Lions more confident mountains and rocks
 More free from motionno not Death himself
 In mortal fury half so peremptory
 As we to keep this city
 BASTARD Heres a stay
 That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
 Out of his rags Heres a large mouth indeed
 That spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas
 Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
 As maids of thirteen do of puppydogs
 What cannoneer begot this lusty blood
 He speaks plain cannonfire and smoke and bounce
 He gives the bastinado with his tongue
 Our ears are cudgelld not a word of his
 But buffets better than a fist of France
 Zounds I was never so bethumpd with words
 Since I first calld my brothers father dad
 ELINOR Son list to this conjunction make this match
 Give with our niece a dowry large enough
 For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
 Thy now unsurd assurance to the crown
 That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
 The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit
 I see a yielding in the looks of France
 Mark how they whisper Urge them while their souls
 Are capable of this ambition
 Lest zeal now melted by the windy breath
 Of soft petitions pity and remorse
 Cool and congeal again to what it was
 CITIZEN Why answer not the double majesties
 This friendly treaty of our threatned town
 KING PHILIP Speak England first that hath been forward first
 To speak unto this city what say you
 KING JOHN If that the Dauphin there thy princely son
 Can in this book of beauty read I love
 Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen
 For Anjou and fair Touraine Maine Poictiers
 And all that we upon this side the sea
 Except this city now by us besiegd
 Find liable to our crown and dignity
 Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
 In titles honours and promotions
 As she in beauty education blood
 Holds hand with any princess of the world
 KING PHILIP What sayst thou boy Look in the ladys face
 LEWIS I do my lord and in her eye I find
 A wonder or a wondrous miracle
 The shadow of myself formd in her eye
 Which being but the shadow of your son
 Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow
 I do protest I never lovd myself
 Till now infixed I beheld myself
 Drawn in the flattering table of her eye
 Whispers with
BLANCH
 BASTARD Aside Drawn in the flattering table of her eye
 Hangd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow
 And quarterd in her hearthe doth espy
 Himself loves traitor This is pity now
 That hangd and drawn and quarterd there should be
 In such a love so vile a lout as he
 BLANCH My uncles will in this respect is mine
 If he see aught in you that makes him like
 That anything he sees which moves his liking
 I can with ease translate it to my will
 Or if you will to speak more properly
 I will enforce it easly to my love
 Further I will not flatter you my lord
 That all I see in you is worthy love
 Than this that nothing do I see in you
 Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge
 That I can find should merit any hate
 KING JOHN What say these young ones What say you my niece
 BLANCH That she is bound in honour still to do
 What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say
 KING JOHN Speak then Prince Dauphin can you love this lady
 LEWIS Nay ask me if I can refrain from love
 For I do love her most unfeignedly
 KING JOHN Then do I give Volquessen Touraine Maine
 Poictiers and Anjou these five provinces
 With her to thee and this addition more
 Full thirty thousand marks of English coin
 Philip of France if thou be pleasd withal
 Command thy son and daughter to join hands
 KING PHILIP It likes us well young princes close your hands
 AUSTRIA And your lips too for I am well assurd
 That I did so when I was first assurd
 KING PHILIP Now citizens of Angiers ope your gates
 Let in that amity which you have made
 For at Saint Marys chapel presently
 The rites of marriage shall be solemnizd
 Is not the Lady Constance in this troop
 I know she is not for this match made up
 Her presence would have interrupted much
 Where is she and her son Tell me who knows
 LEWIS She is sad and passionate at your Highness tent
 KING PHILIP And by my faith this league that we have made
 Will give her sadness very little cure
 Brother of England how may we content
 This widow lady In her right we came
 Which we God knows have turnd another way
 To our own vantage
 KING JOHN We will heal up all
 For well create young Arthur Duke of Britaine
 And Earl of Richmond and this rich fair town
 We make him lord of Call the Lady Constance
 Some speedy messenger bid her repair
 To our solemnity I trust we shall
 If not fill up the measure of her will
 Yet in some measure satisfy her so
 That we shall stop her exclamation
 Go we as well as haste will suffer us
 To this unlookdfor unprepared pomp
 Exeunt all but the
BASTARD
 BASTARD Mad world mad kings mad composition
 John to stop Arthurs tide in the whole
 Hath willingly departed with a part
 And France whose armour conscience buckled on
 Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
 As Gods own soldier rounded in the ear
 With that same purposechanger that sly devil
 That broker that still breaks the pate of faith
 That daily breakvow he that wins of all
 Of kings of beggars old men young men maids
 Who having no external thing to lose
 But the word maid cheats the poor maid of that
 That smoothfacd gentleman tickling commodity
 Commodity the bias of the world
 The world who of itself is peised well
 Made to run even upon even ground
 Till this advantage this viledrawing bias
 This sway of motion this commodity
 Makes it take head from all indifferency
 From all direction purpose course intent
 And this same bias this commodity
 This bawd this broker this allchanging word
 Clappd on the outward eye of fickle France
 Hath drawn him from his own determind aid
 From a resolvd and honourable war
 To a most base and vileconcluded peace
 And why rail I on this commodity
 But for because he hath not wood me yet
 Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
 When his fair angels would salute my palm
 But for my hand as unattempted yet
 Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich
 Well whiles I am a beggar I will rail
 And say there is no sin but to be rich
 And being rich my virtue then shall be
 To say there is no vice but beggary
 Since kings break faith upon commodity
 Gain be my lord for I will worship thee

ACT III SCENE 1

France The FRENCH KINGS camp

Enter CONSTANCE ARTHUR and SALISBURY

 CONSTANCE Gone to be married Gone to swear a peace
 False blood to false blood joind Gone to be friends
 Shall Lewis have Blanch and Blanch those provinces
 It is not so thou hast misspoke misheard
 Be well advisd tell oer thy tale again
 It cannot be thou dost but say tis so
 I trust I may not trust thee for thy word
 Is but the vain breath of a common man
 Believe me I do not believe thee man
 I have a kings oath to the contrary
 Thou shalt be punishd for thus frighting me
 For I am sick and capable of fears
 Oppressd with wrongs and therefore full of fears
 A widow husbandless subject to fears
 A woman naturally born to fears
 And though thou now confess thou didst but jest
 With my vexd spirits I cannot take a truce
 But they will quake and tremble all this day
 What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head
 Why dost thou look so sadly on my son
 What means that hand upon that breast of thine
 Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum
 Like a proud river peering oer his bounds
 Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words
 Then speak againnot all thy former tale
 But this one word whether thy tale be true
 SALISBURY As true as I believe you think them false
 That give you cause to prove my saying true
 CONSTANCE O if thou teach me to believe this sorrow
 Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die
 And let belief and life encounter so
 As doth the fury of two desperate men
 Which in the very meeting fall and die
 Lewis marry Blanch O boy then where art thou
 France friend with England what becomes of me
 Fellow be gone I cannot brook thy sight
 This news hath made thee a most ugly man
 SALISBURY What other harm have I good lady done
 But spoke the harm that is by others done
 CONSTANCE Which harm within itself so heinous is
 As it makes harmful all that speak of it
 ARTHUR I do beseech you madam be content
 CONSTANCE If thou that bidst me be content wert grim
 Ugly and slandrous to thy mothers womb
 Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains
 Lame foolish crooked swart prodigious
 Patchd with foul moles and eyeoffending marks
 I would not care I then would be content
 For then I should not love thee no nor thou
 Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown
 But thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy
 Nature and Fortune joind to make thee great
 Of Natures gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
 And with the halfblown rose but Fortune O
 She is corrupted changd and won from thee
 Sh adulterates hourly with thine uncle John
 And with her golden hand hath pluckd on France
 To tread down fair respect of sovereignty
 And made his majesty the bawd to theirs
 France is a bawd to Fortune and King John
 That strumpet Fortune that usurping John
 Tell me thou fellow is not France forsworn
 Envenom him with words or get thee gone
 And leave those woes alone which I alone
 Am bound to underbear
 SALISBURY Pardon me madam
 I may not go without you to the kings
 CONSTANCE Thou mayst thou shalt I will not go with thee
 I will instruct my sorrows to be proud
 For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop
 To me and to the state of my great grief
 Let kings assemble for my griefs so great
 That no supporter but the huge firm earth
 Can hold it up Seats herself on the
ground
 Here I and sorrows sit
 Here is my throne bid kings come bow to it

 Enter KING JOHN KING PHILIP LEWIS BLANCH
 ELINOR the BASTARD AUSTRIA and attendants

 KING PHILIP Tis true fair daughter and this blessed day
 Ever in France shall be kept festival
 To solemnize this day the glorious sun
 Stays in his course and plays the alchemist
 Turning with splendour of his precious eye
 The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold
 The yearly course that brings this day about
 Shall never see it but a holiday
 CONSTANCE Rising A wicked day and not a holy day
 What hath this day deservd what hath it done
 That it in golden letters should be set
 Among the high tides in the calendar
 Nay rather turn this day out of the week
 This day of shame oppression perjury
 Or if it must stand still let wives with child
 Pray that their burdens may not fall this day
 Lest that their hopes prodigiously be crossd
 But on this day let seamen fear no wreck
 No bargains break that are not this day made
 This day all things begun come to ill end
 Yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change
 KING PHILIP By heaven lady you shall have no cause
 To curse the fair proceedings of this day
 Have I not pawnd to you my majesty
 CONSTANCE You have beguild me with a counterfeit
 Resembling majesty which being touchd and tried
 Proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn
 You came in arms to spill mine enemies blood
 But now in arms you strengthen it with yours
 The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
 Is cold in amity and painted peace
 And our oppression hath made up this league
 Arm arm you heavens against these perjurd kings
 A widow cries Be husband to me heavens
 Let not the hours of this ungodly day
 Wear out the day in peace but ere sunset
 Set armed discord twixt these perjurd kings
 Hear me O hear me
 AUSTRIA Lady Constance peace
 CONSTANCE War war no peace Peace is to me a war
 O Lymoges O Austria thou dost shame
 That bloody spoil Thou slave thou wretch thou coward
 Thou little valiant great in villainy
 Thou ever strong upon the stronger side
 Thou Fortunes champion that dost never fight
 But when her humorous ladyship is by
 To teach thee safety Thou art perjurd too
 And soothst up greatness What a fool art thou
 A ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear
 Upon my party Thou coldblooded slave
 Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side
 Been sworn my soldier bidding me depend
 Upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength
 And dost thou now fall over to my foes
 Thou wear a lions hide Doff it for shame
 And hang a calfsskin on those recreant limbs
 AUSTRIA O that a man should speak those words to me
 BASTARD And hang a calfsskin on those recreant limbs
 AUSTRIA Thou darst not say so villain for thy life
 BASTARD And hang a calfsskin on those recreant limbs
 KING JOHN We like not this thou dost forget thyself

 Enter PANDULPH

 KING PHILIP Here comes the holy legate of the Pope
 PANDULPH Hail you anointed deputies of heaven
 To thee King John my holy errand is
 I Pandulph of fair Milan cardinal
 And from Pope Innocent the legate here
 Do in his name religiously demand
 Why thou against the Church our holy mother
 So wilfully dost spurn and force perforce
 Keep Stephen Langton chosen Archbishop
 Of Canterbury from that holy see
 This in our foresaid holy fathers name
 Pope Innocent I do demand of thee
 KING JOHN What earthly name to interrogatories
 Can task the free breath of a sacred king
 Thou canst not Cardinal devise a name
 So slight unworthy and ridiculous
 To charge me to an answer as the Pope
 Tell him this tale and from the mouth of England
 Add thus much more that no Italian priest
 Shall tithe or toll in our dominions
 But as we under heaven are supreme head
 So under Him that great supremacy
 Where we do reign we will alone uphold
 Without th assistance of a mortal hand
 So tell the Pope all reverence set apart
 To him and his usurpd authority
 KING PHILIP Brother of England you blaspheme in this
 KING JOHN Though you and all the kings of Christendom
 Are led so grossly by this meddling priest
 Dreading the curse that money may buy out
 And by the merit of vile gold dross dust
 Purchase corrupted pardon of a man
 Who in that sale sells pardon from himself
 Though you and all the rest so grossly led
 This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
 Yet I alone alone do me oppose
 Against the Pope and count his friends my foes
 PANDULPH Then by the lawful power that I have
 Thou shalt stand cursd and excommunicate
 And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
 From his allegiance to an heretic
 And meritorious shall that hand be calld
 Canonized and worshippd as a saint
 That takes away by any secret course
 Thy hateful life
 CONSTANCE O lawful let it be
 That I have room with Rome to curse awhile
 Good father Cardinal cry thou amen
 To my keen curses for without my wrong
 There is no tongue hath power to curse him right
 PANDULPH Theres law and warrant lady for my curse
 CONSTANCE And for mine too when law can do no right
 Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong
 Law cannot give my child his kingdom here
 For he that holds his kingdom holds the law
 Therefore since law itself is perfect wrong
 How can the law forbid my tongue to curse
 PANDULPH Philip of France on peril of a curse
 Let go the hand of that archheretic
 And raise the power of France upon his head
 Unless he do submit himself to Rome
 ELINOR Lookst thou pale France Do not let go thy hand
 CONSTANCE Look to that devil lest that France repent
 And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul
 AUSTRIA King Philip listen to the Cardinal
 BASTARD And hang a calfsskin on his recreant limbs
 AUSTRIA Well ruffian I must pocket up these wrongs
 Because
 BASTARD Your breeches best may carry them
 KING JOHN Philip what sayst thou to the Cardinal
 CONSTANCE What should he say but as the Cardinal
 LEWIS Bethink you father for the difference
 Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome
 Or the light loss of England for a friend
 Forgo the easier
 BLANCH Thats the curse of Rome
 CONSTANCE O Lewis stand fast The devil tempts thee here
 In likeness of a new untrimmed bride
 BLANCH The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith
 But from her need
 CONSTANCE O if thou grant my need
 Which only lives but by the death of faith
 That need must needs infer this principle
 That faith would live again by death of need
 O then tread down my need and faith mounts up
 Keep my need up and faith is trodden down
 KING JOHN The King is movd and answers not to this
 CONSTANCE O be removd from him and answer well
 AUSTRIA Do so King Philip hang no more in doubt
 BASTARD Hang nothing but a calfsskin most sweet lout
 KING PHILIP I am perplexd and know not what to say
 PANDULPH What canst thou say but will perplex thee more
 If thou stand excommunicate and cursd
 KING PHILIP Good reverend father make my person yours
 And tell me how you would bestow yourself
 This royal hand and mine are newly knit
 And the conjunction of our inward souls
 Married in league coupled and linkd together
 With all religious strength of sacred vows
 The latest breath that gave the sound of words
 Was deepsworn faith peace amity true love
 Between our kingdoms and our royal selves
 And even before this truce but new before
 No longer than we well could wash our hands
 To clap this royal bargain up of peace
 Heaven knows they were besmeard and overstaind
 With slaughters pencil where revenge did paint
 The fearful difference of incensed kings
 And shall these hands so lately purgd of blood
 So newly joind in love so strong in both
 Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
 Play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven
 Make such unconstant children of ourselves
 As now again to snatch our palm from palm
 Unswear faith sworn and on the marriagebed
 Of smiling peace to march a bloody host
 And make a riot on the gentle brow
 Of true sincerity O holy sir
 My reverend father let it not be so
 Out of your grace devise ordain impose
 Some gentle order and then we shall be blest
 To do your pleasure and continue friends
 PANDULPH All form is formless order orderless
 Save what is opposite to Englands love
 Therefore to arms be champion of our church
 Or let the church our mother breathe her curse
 A mothers curseon her revolting son
 France thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue
 A chafed lion by the mortal paw
 A fasting tiger safer by the tooth
 Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold
 KING PHILIP I may disjoin my hand but not my faith
 PANDULPH So makst thou faith an enemy to faith
 And like a civil war setst oath to oath
 Thy tongue against thy tongue O let thy vow
 First made to heaven first be to heaven performd
 That is to be the champion of our Church
 What since thou sworst is sworn against thyself
 And may not be performed by thyself
 For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
 Is not amiss when it is truly done
 And being not done where doing tends to ill
 The truth is then most done not doing it
 The better act of purposes mistook
 Is to mistake again though indirect
 Yet indirection thereby grows direct
 And falsehood cures as fire cools fire
 Within the scorched veins of one newburnd
 It is religion that doth make vows kept
 But thou hast sworn against religion
 By what thou swearst against the thing thou swearst
 And makst an oath the surety for thy truth
 Against an oath the truth thou art unsure
 To swear swears only not to be forsworn
 Else what a mockery should it be to swear
 But thou dost swear only to be forsworn
 And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear
 Therefore thy later vows against thy first
 Is in thyself rebellion to thyself
 And better conquest never canst thou make
 Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
 Against these giddy loose suggestions
 Upon which better part our prayrs come in
 If thou vouchsafe them But if not then know
 The peril of our curses fight on thee
 So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off
 But in despair die under the black weight
 AUSTRIA Rebellion flat rebellion
 BASTARD Willt not be
 Will not a calfsskin stop that mouth of thine
 LEWIS Father to arms
 BLANCH Upon thy weddingday
 Against the blood that thou hast married
 What shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men
 Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums
 Clamours of hell be measures to our pomp
 O husband hear me ay alack how new
 Is husband in my mouth even for that name
 Which till this time my tongue did neer pronounce
 Upon my knee I beg go not to arms
 Against mine uncle
 CONSTANCE O upon my knee
 Made hard with kneeling I do pray to thee
 Thou virtuous Dauphin alter not the doom
 Forethought by heaven
 BLANCH Now shall I see thy love What motive may
 Be stronger with thee than the name of wife
 CONSTANCE That which upholdeth him that thee upholds
 His honour O thine honour Lewis thine honour
 LEWIS I muse your Majesty doth seem so cold
 When such profound respects do pull you on
 PANDULPH I will denounce a curse upon his head
 KING PHILIP Thou shalt not need England I will fall from
thee
 CONSTANCE O fair return of banishd majesty
 ELINOR O foul revolt of French inconstancy
 KING JOHN France thou shalt rue this hour within this hour
 BASTARD Old Time the clocksetter that bald sexton Time
 Is it as he will Well then France shall rue
 BLANCH The suns oercast with blood Fair day adieu
 Which is the side that I must go withal
 I am with both each army hath a hand
 And in their rage I having hold of both
 They whirl asunder and dismember me
 Husband I cannot pray that thou mayst win
 Uncle I needs must pray that thou mayst lose
 Father I may not wish the fortune thine
 Grandam I will not wish thy wishes thrive
 Whoever wins on that side shall I lose
 Assured loss before the match be playd
 LEWIS Lady with me with me thy fortune lies
 BLANCH There where my fortune lives there my life dies
 KING JOHN Cousin go draw our puissance together
 Exit
BASTARD

the BASTARD HUBERT and LORDS

 KING JOHN To ELINOR So shall it be your Grace shall stay
 behind
 So strongly guarded To ARTHUR Cousin look not sad
 Thy grandam loves thee and thy uncle will
 As dear be to thee as thy father was
 ARTHUR O this will make my mother die with grief
 KING JOHN To the BASTARD Cousin away for England haste
 before
 And ere our coming see thou shake the bags
 Of hoarding abbots imprisoned angels
 Set at liberty the fat ribs of peace
 Must by the hungry now be fed upon
 Use our commission in his utmost force
 BASTARD Bell book and candle shall not drive me back
 When gold and silver becks me to come on
 I leave your Highness Grandam I will pray

 KING JOHN Coz farewell
 Exit
BASTARD
 ELINOR Come hither little kinsman hark a word
 KING JOHN Come hither Hubert O my gentle Hubert
 We owe thee much Within this wall of flesh
 There is a soul counts thee her creditor
 And with advantage means to pay thy love
 And my good friend thy voluntary oath
 Lives in this bosom dearly cherished
 Give me thy hand I had a thing to say
 But I will fit it with some better time
 By heaven Hubert I am almost ashamd
 To say what good respect I have of thee
 HUBERT I am much bounden to your Majesty
 KING JOHN Good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet
 But thou shalt have and creep time neer so slow
 Yet it shall come for me to do thee good
 I had a thing to saybut let it go
 The sun is in the heaven and the proud day
 Attended with the pleasures of the world
 Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
 To give me audience If the midnight bell
 Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
 Sound on into the drowsy race of night
 If this same were a churchyard where we stand
 And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs
 Or if that surly spirit melancholy
 Had bakd thy blood and made it heavythick
 Which else runs tickling up and down the veins
 Making that idiot laughter keep mens eyes
 And strain their cheeks to idle merriment
 A passion hateful to my purposes
 Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes
 Hear me without thine ears and make reply
 Without a tongue using conceit alone
 Without eyes ears and harmful sound of words
 Then in despite of brooded watchful day
 I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts
 But ah I will not Yet I love thee well
 And by my troth I think thou lovst me well
 HUBERT So well that what you bid me undertake
 Though that my death were adjunct to my act
 By heaven I would do it
 KING JOHN Do not I know thou wouldst
 Good Hubert Hubert Hubert throw thine eye
 On yon young boy Ill tell thee what my friend
 He is a very serpent in my way
 And wheresoeer this foot of mine doth tread
 He lies before me Dost thou understand me
 Thou art his keeper
 HUBERT And Ill keep him so
 That he shall not offend your Majesty
 KING JOHN Death
 HUBERT My lord
 KING JOHN A grave
 HUBERT He shall not live
 KING JOHN Enough
 I could be merry now Hubert I love thee
 Well Ill not say what I intend for thee

SCENE 4

France The FRENCH KINGs camp

Enter KING PHILIP LEWIS PANDULPH and attendants

 KING PHILIP So by a roaring tempest on the flood
 A whole armado of convicted sail
 Is scattered and disjoind from fellowship
 PANDULPH Courage and comfort All shall yet go well
 KING PHILIP What can go well when we have run so ill
 Are we not beaten Is not Angiers lost
 Arthur taen prisoner Divers dear friends slain
 And bloody England into England gone
 Oerbearing interruption spite of France
 LEWIS he hath won that hath he fortified
 So hot a speed with such advice disposd
 Such temperate order in so fierce a cause
 Doth want example who hath read or heard
 Of any kindred action like to this
 KING PHILIP Well could I bear that England had this praise
 So we could find some pattern of our shame

 Enter CONSTANCE

 Look who comes here a grave unto a soul
 Holding th eternal spirit against her will
 In the vile prison of afflicted breath
 I prithee lady go away with me
 CONSTANCE Lo now now see the issue of your peace
 KING PHILIP Patience good lady Comfort gentle Constance
 CONSTANCE No I defy all counsel all redress
 But that which ends all counsel true redress
 Death death O amiable lovely death
 Thou odoriferous stench sound rottenness
 Arise forth from the couch of lasting night
 Thou hate and terror to prosperity
 And I will kiss thy detestable bones
 And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
 And ring these fingers with thy household worms
 And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
 And be a carrion monster like thyself
 Come grin on me and I will think thou smilst
 And buss thee as thy wife Miserys love
 O come to me
 KING PHILIP O fair affliction peace
 CONSTANCE No no I will not having breath to cry
 O that my tongue were in the thunders mouth
 Then with a passion would I shake the world
 And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
 Which cannot hear a ladys feeble voice
 Which scorns a modern invocation
 PANDULPH Lady you utter madness and not sorrow
 CONSTANCE Thou art not holy to belie me so
 I am not mad this hair I tear is mine
 My name is Constance I was Geffreys wife
 Young Arthur is my son and he is lost
 I am not madI would to heaven I were
 For then tis like I should forget myself
 O if I could what grief should I forget
 Preach some philosophy to make me mad
 And thou shalt be canonizd Cardinal
 For being not mad but sensible of grief
 My reasonable part produces reason
 How I may be deliverd of these woes
 And teaches me to kill or hang myself
 If I were mad I should forget my son
 Or madly think a babe of clouts were he
 I am not mad too well too well I feel
 The different plague of each calamity
 KING PHILIP Bind up those tresses O what love I note
 In the fair multitude of those her hairs
 Where but by a chance a silver drop hath falln
 Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
 Do glue themselves in sociable grief
 Like true inseparable faithful loves
 Sticking together in calamity
 CONSTANCE To England if you will
 KING PHILIP Bind up your hairs
 CONSTANCE Yes that I will and wherefore will I do it
 I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
 O that these hands could so redeem my son
 As they have given these hairs their liberty
 But now I envy at their liberty
 And will again commit them to their bonds
 Because my poor child is a prisoner
 And father Cardinal I have heard you say
 That we shall see and know our friends in heaven
 If that be true I shall see my boy again
 For since the birth of Cain the first male child
 To him that did but yesterday suspire
 There was not such a gracious creature born
 But now will canker sorrow eat my bud
 And chase the native beauty from his cheek
 And he will look as hollow as a ghost
 As dim and meagre as an agues fit
 And so hell die and rising so again
 When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
 I shall not know him Therefore never never
 Must I behold my pretty Arthur more
 PANDULPH You hold too heinous a respect of grief
 CONSTANCE He talks to me that never had a son
 KING PHILIP You are as fond of grief as of your child
 CONSTANCE Grief fills the room up of my absent child
 Lies in his bed walks up and down with me
 Puts on his pretty looks repeats his words
 Remembers me of all his gracious parts
 Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form
 Then have I reason to be fond of grief
 Fare you well had you such a loss as I
 I could give better comfort than you do
 I will not keep this form upon my head
 Tearing her
hair
 When there is such disorder in my wit
 O Lord my boy my Arthur my fair son
 My life my joy my food my ail the world
 My widowcomfort and my sorrows cure
Exit
 KING PHILIP I fear some outrage and Ill follow her
Exit
 LEWIS Theres nothing in this world can make me joy
 Life is as tedious as a twicetold tale
 Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man
 And bitter shame hath spoild the sweet worlds taste
 That it yields nought but shame and bitterness
 PANDULPH Before the curing of a strong disease
 Even in the instant of repair and health
 The fit is strongest evils that take leave
 On their departure most of all show evil
 What have you lost by losing of this day
 LEWIS All days of glory joy and happiness
 PANDULPH If you had won it certainly you had
 No no when Fortune means to men most good
 She looks upon them with a threatning eye
 Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
 In this which he accounts so clearly won
 Are not you grievd that Arthur is his prisoner
 LEWIS As heartily as he is glad he hath him
 PANDULPH Your mind is all as youthful as your blood
 Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit
 For even the breath of what I mean to speak
 Shall blow each dust each straw each little rub
 Out of the path which shall directly lead
 Thy foot to Englands throne And therefore mark
 John hath seizd Arthur and it cannot be
 That whiles warm life plays in that infants veins
 The misplacd John should entertain an hour
 One minute nay one quiet breath of rest
 A sceptre snatchd with an unruly hand
 Must be boisterously maintaind as gaind
 And he that stands upon a slippry place
 Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
 That John may stand then Arthur needs must fall
 So be it for it cannot be but so
 LEWIS But what shall I gain by young Arthurs fall
 PANDULPH You in the right of Lady Blanch your wife
 May then make all the claim that Arthur did
 LEWIS And lose it life and all as Arthur did
 PANDULPH How green you are and fresh in this old world
 John lays you plots the times conspire with you
 For he that steeps his safety in true blood
 Shall find but bloody safety and untrue
 This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts
 Of all his people and freeze up their zeal
 That none so small advantage shall step forth
 To check his reign but they will cherish it
 No natural exhalation in the sky
 No scope of nature no distemperd day
 No common wind no customed event
 But they will pluck away his natural cause
 And call them meteors prodigies and signs
 Abortives presages and tongues of heaven
 Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John
 LEWIS May be he will not touch young Arthurs life
 But hold himself safe in his prisonment
 PANDULPH O Sir when he shall hear of your approach
 If that young Arthur be not gone already
 Even at that news he dies and then the hearts
 Of all his people shall revolt from him
 And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
 And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
 Out of the bloody fingers ends of john
 Methinks I see this hurly all on foot
 And O what better matter breeds for you
 Than I have namd The bastard Faulconbridge
 Is now in England ransacking the Church
 Offending charity if but a dozen French
 Were there in arms they would be as a can
 To train ten thousand English to their side
 Or as a little snow tumbled about
 Anon becomes a mountain O noble Dauphin
 Go with me to the King Tis wonderful
 What may be wrought out of their discontent
 Now that their souls are topful of offence
 For England go I will whet on the King
 LEWIS Strong reasons makes strong actions Let us go
 If you say ay the King will not say no

England A castle

Enter HUBERT and EXECUTIONERS

 HUBERT Heat me these irons hot and look thou stand
 Within the arras When I strike my foot
 Upon the bosom of the ground rush forth
 And bind the boy which you shall find with me
 Fast to the chair Be heedful hence and watch
 EXECUTIONER I hope your warrant will bear out the deed
 HUBERT Uncleanly scruples Fear not you Look tot
 Exeunt
EXECUTIONERS
 Young lad come forth I have to say with you

 Enter ARTHUR

 ARTHUR Good morrow Hubert
 HUBERT Good morrow little Prince
 ARTHUR As little prince having so great a title
 To be more prince as may be You are sad
 HUBERT Indeed I have been merrier
 ARTHUR Mercy on me
 Methinks no body should be sad but I
 Yet I remember when I was in France
 Young gentlemen would be as sad as night
 Only for wantonness By my christendom
 So I were out of prison and kept sheep
 I should be as merry as the day is long
 And so I would be here but that I doubt
 My uncle practises more harm to me
 He is afraid of me and I of him
 Is it my fault that I was Geffreys son
 No indeed ist not and I would to heaven
 I were your son so you would love me Hubert
 HUBERT Aside If I talk to him with his innocent prate
 He will awake my mercy which lies dead
 Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch
 ARTHUR Are you sick Hubert You look pale today
 In sooth I would you were a little sick
 That I might sit all night and watch with you
 I warrant I love you more than you do me
 HUBERT Aside His words do take possession of my bosom
 Read here young Arthur Showing a
paper
 Aside How now foolish rheum
 Turning dispiteous torture out of door
 I must be brief lest resolution drop
 Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears
 Can you not read it Is it not fair writ
 ARTHUR Too fairly Hubert for so foul effect
 Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes
 HUBERT Young boy I must
 ARTHUR And will you
 HUBERT And I will
 ARTHUR Have you the heart When your head did but ache
 I knit my handkerchief about your brows
 The best I had a princess wrought it me
 And I did never ask it you again
 And with my hand at midnight held your head
 And like the watchful minutes to the hour
 Still and anon cheerd up the heavy time
 Saying What lack you and Where lies your grief
 Or What good love may I perform for you
 Many a poor mans son would have lyen still
 And neer have spoke a loving word to you
 But you at your sick service had a prince
 Nay you may think my love was crafty love
 And call it cunning Do an if you will
 If heaven be pleasd that you must use me ill
 Why then you must Will you put out mine eyes
 These eyes that never did nor never shall
 So much as frown on you
 HUBERT I have sworn to do it
 And with hot irons must I burn them out
 ARTHUR Ah none but in this iron age would do it
 The iron of itself though heat redhot
 Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears
 And quench his fiery indignation
 Even in the matter of mine innocence
 Nay after that consume away in rust
 But for containing fire to harm mine eye
 Are you more stubbornhard than hammerd iron
 An if an angel should have come to me
 And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes
 I would not have believd himno tongue but Huberts
 HUBERT Stamps Come forth

 Reenter EXECUTIONERS With cord irons etc

 Do as I bid you do
 ARTHUR O save me Hubert save me My eyes are out
 Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men
 HUBERT Give me the iron I say and bind him here
 ARTHUR Alas what need you be so boistrous rough
 I will not struggle I will stand stonestill
 For heaven sake Hubert let me not be bound
 Nay hear me Hubert Drive these men away
 And I will sit as quiet as a lamb
 I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word
 Nor look upon the iron angrily
 Thrust but these men away and Ill forgive you
 Whatever torment you do put me to
 HUBERT Go stand within let me alone with him
 EXECUTIONER I am best pleasd to be from such a deed
 Exeunt
EXECUTIONERS
 ARTHUR Alas I then have chid away my friend
 He hath a stern look but a gentle heart
 Let him come back that his compassion may
 Give life to yours
 HUBERT Come boy prepare yourself
 ARTHUR Is there no remedy
 HUBERT None but to lose your eyes
 ARTHUR O heaven that there were but a mote in yours
 A grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair
 Any annoyance in that precious sense
 Then feeling what small things are boisterous there
 Your vile intent must needs seem horrible
 HUBERT Is this your promise Go to hold your tongue
 ARTHUR Hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues
 Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
 Let me not hold my tongue let me not Hubert
 Or Hubert if you will cut out my tongue
 So I may keep mine eyes O spare mine eyes
 Though to no use but still to look on you
 Lo by my troth the instrument is cold
 And would not harm me
 HUBERT I can heat it boy
 ARTHUR No in good sooth the fire is dead with grief
 Being create for comfort to be usd
 In undeserved extremes See else yourself
 There is no malice in this burning coal
 The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out
 And strewd repentant ashes on his head
 HUBERT But with my breath I can revive it boy
 ARTHUR An if you do you will but make it blush
 And glow with shame of your proceedings Hubert
 Nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes
 And like a dog that is compelld to fight
 Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on
 All things that you should use to do me wrong
 Deny their office only you do lack
 That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
 Creatures of note for mercylacking uses
 HUBERT Well see to live I will not touch thine eye
 For all the treasure that thine uncle owes
 Yet I am sworn and I did purpose boy
 With this same very iron to burn them out
 ARTHUR O now you look like Hubert All this while
 You were disguisd
 HUBERT Peace no more Adieu
 Your uncle must not know but you are dead
 Ill fill these dogged spies with false reports
 And pretty child sleep doubtless and secure
 That Hubert for the wealth of all the world
 Will not offend thee
 ARTHUR O heaven I thank you Hubert
 HUBERT Silence no more Go closely in with me
 Much danger do I undergo for thee
Exeunt




SCENE 2

England KING JOHNS palace

Enter KING JOHN PEMBROKE SALISBURY and other LORDS

 KING JOHN Here once again we sit once again crownd
 And lookd upon I hope with cheerful eyes
 PEMBROKE This once again but that your Highness pleasd
 Was once superfluous you were crownd before
 And that high royalty was neer pluckd off
 The faiths of men neer stained with revolt
 Fresh expectation troubled not the land
 With any longdfor change or better state
 SALISBURY Therefore to be possessd with double pomp
 To guard a title that was rich before
 To gild refined gold to paint the lily
 To throw a perfume on the violet
 To smooth the ice or add another hue
 Unto the rainbow or with taperlight
 To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
 Is wasteful and ridiculous excess
 PEMBROKE But that your royal pleasure must be done
 This act is as an ancient tale new told
 And in the last repeating troublesome
 Being urged at a time unseasonable
 SALISBURY In this the antique and wellnoted face
 Of plain old form is much disfigured
 And like a shifted wind unto a sail
 It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about
 Startles and frights consideration
 Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
 For putting on so new a fashiond robe
 PEMBROKE When workmen strive to do better than well
 They do confound their skill in covetousness
 And oftentimes excusing of a fault
 Doth make the fault the worse by th excuse
 As patches set upon a little breach
 Discredit more in hiding of the fault
 Than did the fault before it was so patchd
 SALISBURY To this effect before you were newcrownd
 We breathd our counsel but it pleasd your Highness
 To overbear it and we are all well pleasd
 Since all and every part of what we would
 Doth make a stand at what your Highness will
 KING JOHN Some reasons of this double coronation
 I have possessd you with and think them strong
 And more more strong when lesser is my fear
 I shall indue you with Meantime but ask
 What you would have reformd that is not well
 And well shall you perceive how willingly
 I will both hear and grant you your requests
 PEMBROKE Then I as one that am the tongue of these
 To sound the purposes of all their hearts
 Both for myself and them but chief of all
 Your safety for the which myself and them
 Bend their best studies heartily request
 Th enfranchisement of Arthur whose restraint
 Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
 To break into this dangerous argument
 If what in rest you have in right you hold
 Why then your fearswhich as they say attend
 The steps of wrongshould move you to mew up
 Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
 With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
 The rich advantage of good exercise
 That the times enemies may not have this
 To grace occasions let it be our suit
 That you have bid us ask his liberty
 Which for our goods we do no further ask
 Than whereupon our weal on you depending
 Counts it your weal he have his liberty
 KING JOHN Let it be so I do commit his youth
 To your direction

 Enter HUBERT

 Aside Hubert what news with you
 PEMBROKE This is the man should do the bloody deed
 He showd his warrant to a friend of mine
 The image of a wicked heinous fault
 Lives in his eye that close aspect of his
 Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast
 And I do fearfully believe tis done
 What we so feard he had a charge to do
 SALISBURY The colour of the King doth come and go
 Between his purpose and his conscience
 Like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set
 His passion is so ripe it needs must break
 PEMBROKE And when it breaks I fear will issue thence
 The foul corruption of a sweet childs death
 KING JOHN We cannot hold mortalitys strong hand
 Good lords although my will to give is living
 The suit which you demand is gone and dead
 He tells us Arthur is deceasd tonight
 SALISBURY Indeed we feard his sickness was past cure
 PEMBROKE Indeed we heard how near his death he was
 Before the child himself felt he was sick
 This must be answerd either here or hence
 KING JOHN Why do you bend such solemn brows on me
 Think you I bear the shears of destiny
 Have I commandment on the pulse of life
 SALISBURY It is apparent foulplay and tis shame
 That greatness should so grossly offer it
 So thrive it in your game and so farewell
 PEMBROKE Stay yet Lord Salisbury Ill go with thee
 And find th inheritance of this poor child
 His little kingdom of a forced grave
 That blood which owd the breadth of all this isle
 Three foot of it doth holdbad world the while
 This must not be thus borne this will break out
 To all our sorrows and ere long I doubt Exeunt
LORDS
 KING JOHN They burn in indignation I repent
 There is no sure foundation set on blood
 No certain life achievd by others death

 Enter a MESSENGER

 A fearful eye thou hast where is that blood
 That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks
 So foul a sky clears not without a storm
 Pour down thy weatherhow goes all in France
 MESSENGER From France to England Never such a powr
 For any foreign preparation
 Was levied in the body of a land
 The copy of your speed is learnd by them
 For when you should be told they do prepare
 The tidings comes that they are all arrivd
 KING JOHN O where hath our intelligence been drunk
 Where hath it slept Where is my mothers care
 That such an army could be drawn in France
 And she not hear of it
 MESSENGER My liege her ear
 Is stoppd with dust the first of April died
 Your noble mother and as I hear my lord
 The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
 Three days before but this from rumours tongue
 I idly heardif true or false I know not
 KING JOHN Withhold thy speed dreadful occasion
 O make a league with me till I have pleasd
 My discontented peers What mother dead
 How wildly then walks my estate in France
 Under whose conduct came those powrs of France
 That thou for truth givst out are landed here
 MESSENGER Under the Dauphin
 KING JOHN Thou hast made me giddy
 With these in tidings

 Enter the BASTARD and PETER OF POMFRET

 Now What says the world
 To your proceedings Do not seek to stuff
 My head with more ill news for it is full
 BASTARD But if you be afeard to hear the worst
 Then let the worst unheard fall on your head
 KING JOHN Bear with me cousin for I was amazd
 Under the tide but now I breathe again
 Aloft the flood and can give audience
 To any tongue speak it of what it will
 BASTARD How I have sped among the clergymen
 The sums I have collected shall express
 But as I travelld hither through the land
 I find the people strangely fantasied
 Possessd with rumours full of idle dreams
 Not knowing what they fear but full of fear
 And heres a prophet that I brought with me
 From forth the streets of Pomfret whom I found
 With many hundreds treading on his heels
 To whom he sung in rude harshsounding rhymes
 That ere the next Ascensionday at noon
 Your Highness should deliver up your crown
 KING JOHN Thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so
 PETER Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so
 KING JOHN Hubert away with him imprison him
 And on that day at noon whereon he says
 I shall yield up my crown let him be hangd
 Deliver him to safety and return
 For I must use thee
 Exit HUBERT with
PETER
 O my gentle cousin
 Hearst thou the news abroad who are arrivd
 BASTARD The French my lord mens mouths are full of it
 Besides I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury
 With eyes as red as newenkindled fire
 And others more going to seek the grave
 Of Arthur whom they say is killd tonight
 On your suggestion
 KING JOHN Gentle kinsman go
 And thrust thyself into their companies
 I have a way to will their loves again
 Bring them before me
 BASTARD I will seek them out
 KING JOHN Nay but make haste the better foot before
 O let me have no subject enemies
 When adverse foreigners affright my towns
 With dreadful pomp of stout invasion
 Be Mercury set feathers to thy heels
 And fly like thought from them to me again
 BASTARD The spirit of the time shall teach me speed
 KING JOHN Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman
 Exit
BASTARD
 Go after him for he perhaps shall need
 Some messenger betwixt me and the peers
 And be thou he
 MESSENGER With all my heart my liege
Exit
 KING JOHN My mother dead

 Reenter HUBERT

 HUBERT My lord they say five moons were seen tonight
 Four fixed and the fifth did whirl about
 The other four in wondrous motion
 KING JOHN Five moons
 HUBERT Old men and beldams in the streets
 Do prophesy upon it dangerously
 Young Arthurs death is common in their mouths
 And when they talk of him they shake their heads
 And whisper one another in the ear
 And he that speaks doth gripe the hearers wrist
 Whilst he that hears makes fearful action
 With wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes
 I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus
 The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool
 With open mouth swallowing a tailors news
 Who with his shears and measure in his hand
 Standing on slippers which his nimble haste
 Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
 Told of a many thousand warlike French
 That were embattailed and rankd in Kent
 Another lean unwashd artificer
 Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthurs death
 KING JOHN Why seekst thou to possess me with these fears
 Why urgest thou so oft young Arthurs death
 Thy hand hath murdred him I had a mighty cause
 To wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him
 HUBERT No had my lord Why did you not provoke me
 KING JOHN It is the curse of kings to be attended
 By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
 To break within the bloody house of life
 And on the winking of authority
 To understand a law to know the meaning
 Of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns
 More upon humour than advisd respect
 HUBERT Here is your hand and seal for what I did
 KING JOHN O when the last account twixt heaven and earth
 Is to be made then shall this hand and seal
 Witness against us to damnation
 How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
 Make deeds ill done Hadst not thou been by
 A fellow by the hand of nature markd
 Quoted and signd to do a deed of shame
 This murder had not come into my mind
 But taking note of thy abhorrd aspect
 Finding thee fit for bloody villainy
 Apt liable to be employd in danger
 I faintly broke with thee of Arthurs death
 And thou to be endeared to a king
 Made it no conscience to destroy a prince
 HUBERT My lord
 KING JOHN Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause
 When I spake darkly what I purposed
 Or turnd an eye of doubt upon my face
 As bid me tell my tale in express words
 Deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off
 And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
 But thou didst understand me by my signs
 And didst in signs again parley with sin
 Yea without stop didst let thy heart consent
 And consequently thy rude hand to act
 The deed which both our tongues held vile to name
 Out of my sight and never see me more
 My nobles leave me and my state is braved
 Even at my gates with ranks of foreign powrs
 Nay in the body of the fleshly land
 This kingdom this confine of blood and breath
 Hostility and civil tumult reigns
 Between my conscience and my cousins death
 HUBERT Arm you against your other enemies
 Ill make a peace between your soul and you
 Young Arthur is alive This hand of mine
 Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand
 Not painted with the crimson spots of blood
 Within this bosom never entred yet
 The dreadful motion of a murderous thought
 And you have slanderd nature in my form
 Which howsoever rude exteriorly
 Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
 Than to be butcher of an innocent child
 KING JOHN Doth Arthur live O haste thee to the peers
 Throw this report on their incensed rage
 And make them tame to their obedience
 Forgive the comment that my passion made
 Upon thy feature for my rage was blind
 And foul imaginary eyes of blood
 Presented thee more hideous than thou art
 O answer not but to my closet bring
 The angry lords with all expedient haste
 I conjure thee but slowly run more fast
Exeunt




SCENE 3

England Before the castle

Enter ARTHUR on the walls

 ARTHUR The wall is high and yet will I leap down
 Good ground be pitiful and hurt me not
 Theres few or none do know me if they did
 This shipboys semblance hath disguisd me quite
 I am afraid and yet Ill venture it
 If I get down and do not break my limbs
 Ill find a thousand shifts to get away
 As good to die and go as die and stay Leaps
down
 O me my uncles spirit is in these stones
 Heaven take my soul and England keep my bones
 Dies

 Enter PEMBROKE SALISBURY and BIGOT

 SALISBURY Lords I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury
 It is our safety and we must embrace
 This gentle offer of the perilous time
 PEMBROKE Who brought that letter from the Cardinal
 SALISBURY The Count Melun a noble lord of France
 Whose private with me of the Dauphins love
 Is much more general than these lines import
 BIGOT Tomorrow morning let us meet him then
 SALISBURY Or rather then set forward for twill be

 Enter the BASTARD

 BASTARD Once more today well met distemperd lords
 The King by me requests your presence straight
 SALISBURY The King hath dispossessd himself of us
 We will not line his thin bestained cloak
 With our pure honours nor attend the foot
 That leaves the print of blood whereer it walks
 Return and tell him so We know the worst
 BASTARD Whateer you think good words I think were best
 SALISBURY Our griefs and not our manners reason now
 BASTARD But there is little reason in your grief
 Therefore twere reason you had manners now
 PEMBROKE Sir sir impatience hath his privilege
 BASTARD Tis trueto hurt his master no man else
 SALISBURY This is the prison What is he lies here
 PEMBROKE O death made proud with pure and princely beauty
 The earth had not a hole to hide this deed
 SALISBURY Murder as hating what himself hath done
 Doth lay it open to urge on revenge
 BIGOT Or when he doomd this beauty to a grave
 Found it too preciousprincely for a grave
 SALISBURY Sir Richard what think you Have you beheld
 Or have you read or heard or could you think
 Or do you almost think although you see
 That you do see Could thought without this object
 Form such another This is the very top
 The height the crest or crest unto the crest
 Of murders arms this is the bloodiest shame
 The wildest savagery the vilest stroke
 That ever walleyd wrath or staring rage
 Presented to the tears of soft remorse
 PEMBROKE All murders past do stand excusd in this
 And this so sole and so unmatchable
 Shall give a holiness a purity
 To the yet unbegotten sin of times
 And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest
 Exampled by this heinous spectacle
 BASTARD It is a damned and a bloody work
 The graceless action of a heavy hand
 If that it be the work of any hand
 SALISBURY If that it be the work of any hand
 We had a kind of light what would ensue
 It is the shameful work of Huberts hand
 The practice and the purpose of the King
 From whose obedience I forbid my soul
 Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life
 And breathing to his breathless excellence
 The incense of a vow a holy vow
 Never to taste the pleasures of the world
 Never to be infected with delight
 Nor conversant with ease and idleness
 Till I have set a glory to this hand
 By giving it the worship of revenge
 PEMBROKE and BIGOT Our souls religiously confirm thy words

 Enter HUBERT

 HUBERT Lords I am hot with haste in seeking you
 Arthur doth live the King hath sent for you
 SALISBURY O he is bold and blushes not at death
 Avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone
 HUBERT I am no villain
 SALISBURY Must I rob the law Drawing his
sword
 BASTARD Your sword is bright sir put it up again
 SALISBURY Not till I sheathe it in a murderers skin
 HUBERT Stand back Lord Salisbury stand back I say
 By heaven I think my swords as sharp as yours
 I would not have you lord forget yourself
 Nor tempt the danger of my true defence
 Lest I by marking of your rage forget
 Your worth your greatness and nobility
 BIGOT Out dunghill Darst thou brave a nobleman
 HUBERT Not for my life but yet I dare defend
 My innocent life against an emperor
 SALISBURY Thou art a murderer
 HUBERT Do not prove me so
 Yet I am none Whose tongue soeer speaks false
 Not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies
 PEMBROKE Cut him to pieces
 BASTARD Keep the peace I say
 SALISBURY Stand by or I shall gall you Faulconbridge
 BASTARD Thou wert better gall the devil Salisbury
 If thou but frown on me or stir thy foot
 Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame
 Ill strike thee dead Put up thy sword betime
 Or Ill so maul you and your toastingiron
 That you shall think the devil is come from hell
 BIGOT What wilt thou do renowned Faulconbridge
 Second a villain and a murderer
 HUBERT Lord Bigot I am none
 BIGOT Who killd this prince
 HUBERT Tis not an hour since I left him well
 I honourd him I lovd him and will weep
 My date of life out for his sweet lifes loss
 SALISBURY Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes
 For villainy is not without such rheum
 And he long traded in it makes it seem
 Like rivers of remorse and innocency
 Away with me all you whose souls abhor
 Th uncleanly savours of a slaughterhouse
 For I am stifled with this smell of sin
 BIGOT Away toward Bury to the Dauphin there
 PEMBROKE There tell the King he may inquire us out
 Exeunt
LORDS
 BASTARD Heres a good world Knew you of this fair work
 Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
 Of mercy if thou didst this deed of death
 Art thou damnd Hubert
 HUBERT Do but hear me sir
 BASTARD Ha Ill tell thee what
 Thourt damnd as blacknay nothing is so black
 Thou art more deep damnd than Prince Lucifer
 There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
 As thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child
 HUBERT Upon my soul
 BASTARD If thou didst but consent
 To this most cruel act do but despair
 And if thou wantst a cord the smallest thread
 That ever spider twisted from her womb
 Will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam
 To hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself
 Put but a little water in a spoon
 And it shall be as all the ocean
 Enough to stifle such a villain up
 I do suspect thee very grievously
 HUBERT If I in act consent or sin of thought
 Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
 Which was embounded in this beauteous clay
 Let hell want pains enough to torture me
 I left him well
 BASTARD Go bear him in thine arms
 I am amazd methinks and lose my way
 Among the thorns and dangers of this world
 How easy dost thou take all England up
 From forth this morsel of dead royalty
 The life the right and truth of all this realm
 Is fled to heaven and England now is left
 To tug and scamble and to part by th teeth
 The unowed interest of proudswelling state
 Now for the barepickd bone of majesty
 Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
 And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace
 Now powers from home and discontents at home
 Meet in one line and vast confusion waits
 As doth a raven on a sickfalln beast
 The imminent decay of wrested pomp
 Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
 Hold out this tempest Bear away that child
 And follow me with speed Ill to the King
 A thousand businesses are brief in hand
 And heaven itself doth frown upon the land
Exeunt

ACT V SCENE 1
England KING JOHNS palace

Enter KING JOHN PANDULPH and attendants

 KING JOHN Thus have I yielded up into your hand
 The circle of my glory
 PANDULPH Gives back the crown Take again
 From this my hand as holding of the Pope
 Your sovereign greatness and authority
 KING JOHN Now keep your holy word go meet the French
 And from his Holiness use all your power
 To stop their marches fore we are inflamd
 Our discontented counties do revolt
 Our people quarrel with obedience
 Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
 To stranger blood to foreign royalty
 This inundation of mistempred humour
 Rests by you only to be qualified
 Then pause not for the present times so sick
 That present medcine must be ministred
 Or overthrow incurable ensues
 PANDULPH It was my breath that blew this tempest up
 Upon your stubborn usage of the Pope
 But since you are a gentle convertite
 My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
 And make fair weather in your blustring land
 On this Ascensionday remember well
 Upon your oath of service to the Pope
 Go I to make the French lay down their arms
Exit
 KING JOHN Is this Ascensionday Did not the prophet
 Say that before Ascensionday at noon
 My crown I should give off Even so I have
 I did suppose it should be on constraint
 But heaven be thankd it is but voluntary

 Enter the BASTARD

 BASTARD All Kent hath yielded nothing there holds out
 But Dover Castle London hath receivd
 Like a kind host the Dauphin and his powers
 Your nobles will not hear you but are gone
 To offer service to your enemy
 And wild amazement hurries up and down
 The little number of your doubtful friends
 KING JOHN Would not my lords return to me again
 After they heard young Arthur was alive
 BASTARD They found him dead and cast into the streets
 An empty casket where the jewel of life
 By some damnd hand was robbed and taen away
 KING JOHN That villain Hubert told me he did live
 BASTARD So on my soul he did for aught he knew
 But wherefore do you droop Why look you sad
 Be great in act as you have been in thought
 Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
 Govern the motion of a kingly eye
 Be stirring as the time be fire with fire
 Threaten the threatner and outface the brow
 Of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes
 That borrow their behaviours from the great
 Grow great by your example and put on
 The dauntless spirit of resolution
 Away and glister like the god of war
 When he intendeth to become the field
 Show boldness and aspiring confidence
 What shall they seek the lion in his den
 And fright him there and make him tremble there
 O let it not be said Forage and run
 To meet displeasure farther from the doors
 And grapple with him ere he come so nigh
 KING JOHN The legate of the Pope hath been with me
 And I have made a happy peace with him
 And he hath promisd to dismiss the powers
 Led by the Dauphin
 BASTARD O inglorious league
 Shall we upon the footing of our land
 Send fairplay orders and make compromise
 Insinuation parley and base truce
 To arms invasive Shall a beardless boy
 A cockred silken wanton brave our fields
 And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil
 Mocking the air with colours idly spread
 And find no check Let us my liege to arms
 Perchance the Cardinal cannot make your peace
 Or if he do let it at least be said
 They saw we had a purpose of defence
 KING JOHN Have thou the ordering of this present time
 BASTARD Away then with good courage
 Yet I know
 Our party may well meet a prouder foe
Exeunt




SCENE 2
England The DAUPHINS camp at Saint Edmundsbury

Enter in arms LEWIS SALISBURY MELUN PEMBROKE BIGOT and
soldiers

 LEWIS My Lord Melun let this be copied out
 And keep it safe for our remembrance
 Return the precedent to these lords again
 That having our fair order written down
 Both they and we perusing oer these notes
 May know wherefore we took the sacrament
 And keep our faiths firm and inviolable
 SALISBURY Upon our sides it never shall be broken
 And noble Dauphin albeit we swear
 A voluntary zeal and an unurgd faith
 To your proceedings yet believe me Prince
 I am not glad that such a sore of time
 Should seek a plaster by contemnd revolt
 And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
 By making many O it grieves my soul
 That I must draw this metal from my side
 To be a widowmaker O and there
 Where honourable rescue and defence
 Cries out upon the name of Salisbury
 But such is the infection of the time
 That for the health and physic of our right
 We cannot deal but with the very hand
 Of stern injustice and confused wrong
 And ist not pity O my grieved friends
 That we the sons and children of this isle
 Were born to see so sad an hour as this
 Wherein we step after a strangermarch
 Upon her gentle bosom and fill up
 Her enemies ranksI must withdraw and weep
 Upon the spot of this enforced cause
 To grace the gentry of a land remote
 And follow unacquainted colours here
 What here O nation that thou couldst remove
 That Neptunes arms who clippeth thee about
 Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
 And grapple thee unto a pagan shore
 Where these two Christian armies might combine
 The blood of malice in a vein of league
 And not to spend it so unneighbourly
 LEWIS A noble temper dost thou show in this
 And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
 Doth make an earthquake of nobility
 O what a noble combat hast thou fought
 Between compulsion and a brave respect
 Let me wipe off this honourable dew
 That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
 My heart hath melted at a ladys tears
 Being an ordinary inundation
 But this effusion of such manly drops
 This showr blown up by tempest of the soul
 Startles mine eyes and makes me more amazd
 Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
 Figurd quite oer with burning meteors
 Lift up thy brow renowned Salisbury
 And with a great heart heave away this storm
 Commend these waters to those baby eyes
 That never saw the giant world enragd
 Nor met with fortune other than at feasts
 Full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping
 Come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
 Into the purse of rich prosperity
 As Lewis himself So nobles shall you all
 That knit your sinews to the strength of mine

 Enter PANDULPH

 And even there methinks an angel spake
 Look where the holy legate comes apace
 To give us warrant from the hand of heaven
 And on our actions set the name of right
 With holy breath
 PANDULPH Hail noble prince of France
 The next is this King John hath reconcild
 Himself to Rome his spirit is come in
 That so stood out against the holy Church
 The great metropolis and see of Rome
 Therefore thy threatning colours now wind up
 And tame the savage spirit of wild war
 That like a lion fostered up at hand
 It may lie gently at the foot of peace
 And be no further harmful than in show
 LEWIS Your Grace shall pardon me I will not back
 I am too highborn to be propertied
 To be a secondary at control
 Or useful servingman and instrument
 To any sovereign state throughout the world
 Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
 Between this chastisd kingdom and myself
 And brought in matter that should feed this fire
 And now tis far too huge to be blown out
 With that same weak wind which enkindled it
 You taught me how to know the face of right
 Acquainted me with interest to this land
 Yea thrust this enterprise into my heart
 And come ye now to tell me John hath made
 His peace with Rome What is that peace to me
 I by the honour of my marriagebed
 After young Arthur claim this land for mine
 And now it is halfconquerd must I back
 Because that John hath made his peace with Rome
 Am I Romes slave What penny hath Rome borne
 What men provided what munition sent
 To underprop this action Is t not I
 That undergo this charge Who else but I
 And such as to my claim are liable
 Sweat in this business and maintain this war
 Have I not heard these islanders shout out
 Vive le roi as I have bankd their towns
 Have I not here the best cards for the game
 To will this easy match playd for a crown
 And shall I now give oer the yielded set
 No no on my soul it never shall be said
 PANDULPH You look but on the outside of this work
 LEWIS Outside or inside I will not return
 Till my attempt so much be glorified
 As to my ample hope was promised
 Before I drew this gallant head of war
 And culld these fiery spirits from the world
 To outlook conquest and to will renown
 Even in the jaws of danger and of death
 Trumpet
sounds
 What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us

 Enter the BASTARD attended

 BASTARD According to the fair play of the world
 Let me have audience I am sent to speak
 My holy lord of Milan from the King
 I come to learn how you have dealt for him
 And as you answer I do know the scope
 And warrant limited unto my tongue
 PANDULPH The Dauphin is too wilfulopposite
 And will not temporize with my entreaties
 He flatly says hell not lay down his arms
 BASTARD By all the blood that ever fury breathd
 The youth says well Now hear our English King
 For thus his royalty doth speak in me
 He is prepard and reason too he should
 This apish and unmannerly approach
 This harnessd masque and unadvised revel
 This unhaird sauciness and boyish troops
 The King doth smile at and is well prepard
 To whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms
 From out the circle of his territories
 That hand which had the strength even at your door
 To cudgel you and make you take the hatch
 To dive like buckets in concealed wells
 To crouch in litter of your stable planks
 To lie like pawns lockd up in chests and trunks
 To hug with swine to seek sweet safety out
 In vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake
 Even at the crying of your nations crow
 Thinking this voice an armed Englishman
 Shall that victorious hand be feebled here
 That in your chambers gave you chastisement
 No Know the gallant monarch is in arms
 And like an eagle oer his aery towrs
 To souse annoyance that comes near his nest
 And you degenerate you ingrate revolts
 You bloody Neroes ripping up the womb
 Of your dear mother England blush for shame
 For your own ladies and palevisagd maids
 Like Amazons come tripping after drums
 Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change
 Their needles to lances and their gentle hearts
 To fierce and bloody inclination
 LEWIS There end thy brave and turn thy face in peace
 We grant thou canst outscold us Fare thee well
 We hold our time too precious to be spent
 With such a brabbler
 PANDULPH Give me leave to speak
 BASTARD No I will speak
 LEWIS We will attend to neither
 Strike up the drums and let the tongue of war
 Plead for our interest and our being here
 BASTARD Indeed your drums being beaten will cry out
 And so shall you being beaten Do but start
 And echo with the clamour of thy drum
 And even at hand a drum is ready bracd
 That shall reverberate all as loud as thine
 Sound but another and another shall
 As loud as thine rattle the welkins ear
 And mock the deepmouthd thunder for at hand
 Not trusting to this halting legate here
 Whom he hath usd rather for sport than need
 Is warlike John and in his forehead sits
 A bareribbd death whose office is this day
 To feast upon whole thousands of the French
 LEWIS Strike up our drums to find this danger out
 BASTARD And thou shalt find it Dauphin do not doubt
 Exeunt




SCENE 3

England The field of battle

Alarums Enter KING JOHN and HUBERT

 KING JOHN How goes the day with us O tell me Hubert
 HUBERT Badly I fear How fares your Majesty
 KING JOHN This fever that hath troubled me so long
 Lies heavy on me O my heart is sick

 Enter a MESSENGER

 MESSENGER My lord your valiant kinsman Faulconbridge
 Desires your Majesty to leave the field
 And send him word by me which way you go
 KING JOHN Tell him toward Swinstead to the abbey there
 MESSENGER Be of good comfort for the great supply
 That was expected by the Dauphin here
 Are wreckd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands
 This news was brought to Richard but even now
 The French fight coldly and retire themselves
 KING JOHN Ay me this tyrant fever burns me up
 And will not let me welcome this good news
 Set on toward Swinstead to my litter straight
 Weakness possesseth me and I am faint
Exeunt




SCENE 4

England Another part of the battlefield

Enter SALISBURY PEMBROKE and BIGOT

 SALISBURY I did not think the King so stord with friends
 PEMBROKE Up once again put spirit in the French
 If they miscarry we miscarry too
 SALISBURY That misbegotten devil Faulconbridge
 In spite of spite alone upholds the day
 PEMBROKE They say King John sore sick hath left the field

 Enter MELUN wounded

 MELUN Lead me to the revolts of England here
 SALISBURY When we were happy we had other names
 PEMBROKE It is the Count Melun
 SALISBURY Wounded to death
 MELUN Fly noble English you are bought and sold
 Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
 And welcome home again discarded faith
 Seek out King John and fall before his feet
 For if the French be lords of this loud day
 He means to recompense the pains you take
 By cutting off your heads Thus hath he sworn
 And I with him and many moe with me
 Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury
 Even on that altar where we swore to you
 Dear amity and everlasting love
 SALISBURY May this be possible May this be true
 MELUN Have I not hideous death within my view
 Retaining but a quantity of life
 Which bleeds away even as a form of wax
 Resolveth from his figure gainst the fire
 What in the world should make me now deceive
 Since I must lose the use of all deceit
 Why should I then be false since it is true
 That I must die here and live hence by truth
 I say again if Lewis do will the day
 He is forsworn if eer those eyes of yours
 Behold another day break in the east
 But even this night whose black contagious breath
 Already smokes about the burning crest
 Of the old feeble and daywearied sun
 Even this ill night your breathing shall expire
 Paying the fine of rated treachery
 Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives
 If Lewis by your assistance win the day
 Commend me to one Hubert with your King
 The love of himand this respect besides
 For that my grandsire was an Englishman
 Awakes my conscience to confess all this
 In lieu whereof I pray you bear me hence
 From forth the noise and rumour of the field
 Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
 In peace and part this body and my soul
 With contemplation and devout desires
 SALISBURY We do believe thee and beshrew my soul
 But I do love the favour and the form
 Of this most fair occasion by the which
 We will untread the steps of damned flight
 And like a bated and retired flood
 Leaving our rankness and irregular course
 Stoop low within those bounds we have oerlookd
 And calmly run on in obedience
 Even to our ocean to great King John
 My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence
 For I do see the cruel pangs of death
 Right in thine eye Away my friends New flight
 And happy newness that intends old right
 Exeunt leading off
MELUN




SCENE 5

England The French camp

Enter LEWIS and his train

 LEWIS The sun of heaven methought was loath to set
 But stayd and made the western welkin blush
 When English measure backward their own ground
 In faint retire O bravely came we off
 When with a volley of our needless shot
 After such bloody toil we bid good night
 And wound our tottring colours clearly up
 Last in the field and almost lords of it

 Enter a MESSENGER

 MESSENGER Where is my prince the Dauphin
 LEWIS Here what news
 MESSENGER The Count Melun is slain the English lords
 By his persuasion are again falln off
 And your supply which you have wishd so long
 Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands
 LEWIS Ah foul shrewd news Beshrew thy very heart
 I did not think to be so sad tonight
 As this hath made me Who was he that said
 King John did fly an hour or two before
 The stumbling night did part our weary powrs
 MESSENGER Whoever spoke it it is true my lord
 LEWIS keep good quarter and good care tonight
 The day shall not be up so soon as I
 To try the fair adventure of tomorrow
Exeunt




SCENE 6

An open place near Swinstead Abbey

Enter the BASTARD and HUBERT severally

 HUBERT Whos there Speak ho speak quickly or I shoot
 BASTARD A friend What art thou
 HUBERT Of the part of England
 BASTARD Whither dost thou go
 HUBERT Whats that to thee Why may I not demand
 Of thine affairs as well as thou of mine
 BASTARD Hubert I think
 HUBERT Thou hast a perfect thought
 I will upon all hazards well believe
 Thou art my friend that knowst my tongue so well
 Who art thou
 BASTARD Who thou wilt And if thou please
 Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
 I come one way of the Plantagenets
 HUBERT Unkind remembrance thou and eyeless night
 Have done me shame Brave soldier pardon me
 That any accent breaking from thy tongue
 Should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear
 BASTARD Come come sans compliment what news abroad
 HUBERT Why here walk I in the black brow of night
 To find you out
 BASTARD Brief then and whats the news
 HUBERT O my sweet sir news fitting to the night
 Black fearful comfortless and horrible
 BASTARD Show me the very wound of this ill news
 I am no woman Ill not swoon at it
 HUBERT The King I fear is poisond by a monk
 I left him almost speechless and broke out
 To acquaint you with this evil that you might
 The better arm you to the sudden time
 Than if you had at leisure known of this
 BASTARD How did he take it who did taste to him
 HUBERT A monk I tell you a resolved villain
 Whose bowels suddenly burst out The King
 Yet speaks and peradventure may recover
 BASTARD Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty
 HUBERT Why know you not The lords are all come back
 And brought Prince Henry in their company
 At whose request the King hath pardond them
 And they are all about his Majesty
 BASTARD Withhold thine indignation mighty heaven
 And tempt us not to bear above our power
 Ill tell thee Hubert half my power this night
 Passing these flats are taken by the tide
 These Lincoln Washes have devoured them
 Myself wellmounted hardly have escapd
 Away before conduct me to the King
 I doubt he will be dead or ere I come
Exeunt




SCENE 7

The orchard at Swinstead Abbey

Enter PRINCE HENRY SALISBURY and BIGOT

 PRINCE HENRY It is too late the life of all his blood
 Is touchd corruptibly and his pure brain
 Which some suppose the souls frail dwellinghouse
 Doth by the idle comments that it makes
 Foretell the ending of mortality

 Enter PEMBROKE

 PEMBROKE His Highness yet doth speak and holds belief
 That being brought into the open air
 It would allay the burning quality
 Of that fell poison which assaileth him
 PRINCE HENRY Let him be brought into the orchard here
 Doth he still rage Exit
BIGOT
 PEMBROKE He is more patient
 Than when you left him even now he sung
 PRINCE HENRY O vanity of sickness Fierce extremes
 In their continuance will not feel themselves
 Death having preyd upon the outward parts
 Leaves them invisible and his siege is now
 Against the mind the which he pricks and wounds
 With many legions of strange fantasies
 Which in their throng and press to that last hold
 Confound themselves Tis strange that death should sing
 I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
 Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
 And from the organpipe of frailty sings
 His soul and body to their lasting rest
 SALISBURY Be of good comfort Prince for you are born
 To set a form upon that indigest
 Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude

 Reenter BIGOT and attendants who bring in
 KING JOHN in a chair

 KING JOHN Ay marry now my soul hath elbowroom
 It would not out at windows nor at doors
 There is so hot a summer in my bosom
 That all my bowels crumble up to dust
 I am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
 Upon a parchment and against this fire
 Do I shrink up
 PRINCE HENRY How fares your Majesty
 KING JOHN Poisondillfare Dead forsook cast off
 And none of you will bid the winter come
 To thrust his icy fingers in my maw
 Nor let my kingdoms rivers take their course
 Through my burnd bosom nor entreat the north
 To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
 And comfort me with cold I do not ask you much
 I beg cold comfort and you are so strait
 And so ingrateful you deny me that
 PRINCE HENRY O that there were some virtue in my tears
 That might relieve you
 KING JOHN The salt in them is hot
 Within me is a hell and there the poison
 Is as a fiend confind to tyrannize
 On unreprievable condemned blood

 Enter the BASTARD

 BASTARD O I am scalded with my violent motion
 And spleen of speed to see your Majesty
 KING JOHN O cousin thou art come to set mine eye
 The tackle of my heart is crackd and burnt
 And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
 Are turned to one thread one little hair
 My heart hath one poor string to stay it by
 Which holds but till thy news be uttered
 And then all this thou seest is but a clod
 And module of confounded royalty
 BASTARD The Dauphin is preparing hitherward
 Where God He knows how we shall answer him
 For in a night the best part of my powr
 As I upon advantage did remove
 Were in the Washes all unwarily
 Devoured by the unexpected flood The KING
dies
 SALISBURY You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear
 My liege my lord But now a kingnow thus
 PRINCE HENRY Even so must I run on and even so stop
 What surety of the world what hope what stay
 When this was now a king and now is clay
 BASTARD Art thou gone so I do but stay behind
 To do the office for thee of revenge
 And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven
 As it on earth hath been thy servant still
 Now now you stars that move in your right spheres
 Where be your powrs Show now your mended faiths
 And instantly return with me again
 To push destruction and perpetual shame
 Out of the weak door of our fainting land
 Straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought
 The Dauphin rages at our very heels
 SALISBURY It seems you know not then so much as we
 The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest
 Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin
 And brings from him such offers of our peace
 As we with honour and respect may take
 With purpose presently to leave this war
 BASTARD He will the rather do it when he sees
 Ourselves well sinewed to our defence
 SALISBURY Nay tis in a manner done already
 For many carriages he hath dispatchd
 To the seaside and put his cause and quarrel
 To the disposing of the Cardinal
 With whom yourself myself and other lords
 If you think meet this afternoon will post
 To consummate this business happily
 BASTARD Let it be so And you my noble Prince
 With other princes that may best be spard
 Shall wait upon your fathers funeral
 PRINCE HENRY At Worcester must his body be interrd
 For so he willd it
 BASTARD Thither shall it then
 And happily may your sweet self put on
 The lineal state and glory of the land
 To whom with all submission on my knee
 I do bequeath my faithful services
 And true subjection everlastingly
 SALISBURY And the like tender of our love we make
 To rest without a spot for evermore
 PRINCE HENRY I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
 And knows not how to do it but with tears
 BASTARD O let us pay the time but needful woe
 Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs
 This England never did nor never shall
 Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror
 But when it first did help to wound itself
 Now these her princes are come home again
 Come the three corners of the world in arms
 And we shall shock them Nought shall make us rue
 If England to itself do rest but true
Exeunt
